txt Representative John V. Lindsay , the Republican candidate for Mayor , proposed yesterday a program " to help relieve the summer tensions and frustrations " and head off possible racial violence . " We ought to start by viewing the next several weeks not as a summer of discontent but as a summer of opportunity , " he told a meeting of Harlem leaders . He said the city could " prove " this summer that it " can be a model of racial harmony . " Mr. Lindsay said Mayor Wagner should appoint immediately an executive assistant on civil rights who would devote his full time keeping " in touch with the moods , tensions and strains of the slum neighborhoods . " Favors Civil Review He also reiterated his call for the addition of four civilians to the Police Department 's threeman board of deputy commissioners to review complaints of police brutality . He said that action by Mayor Wagner by July 1 " will help clear the air more than any single step the Mayor can take . " Mr. Lindsay received no applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the executive committee of the United Council of Harlem . Organizations , meeting at the Harlem Labor Center , 312 %Vest 125th Street . He said later that he had not expected applause . Assemblyman Percy E. Sutton , a Democrat who was chairman of the meeting , said the council represented 87 Harlem organizations , and was formed after last year 's disorders " to prevent , if possible , the long , hot summer here in Harlem , " Me . Sutton said the council was a " cross-section " of the Harlem community , and in ? eluded representatives of the Urban League , the National As. , sociation for the Advancement ' of Colored People , the African Nationalist movement , the Black Muslims , and church and civic groups . Later yesterday the council also heard from Representative Adam Clayton Powell , and from City Council President Paul R. Screvane , who is seeking the Democratic nomination for Mayor , Mr. Screvane did not mention Mr , Lindsay by name , but he said ; " I could come up here and offer a 30-point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Screvane Defends City lie said there was " too much talk about what ought to be done without paying attention to what is being done . " He said some progress had been made and more would he done by the city to solve the Negro 's peek- , : ems . Asked for comment on the ' Lindsay proposals , an aide to Mayor Wagner said : " Mr. Lindsay obviously does n't know , but will doubtless find out , that the city government ; has not only a single aide con. : cerned with civil rights , but an , entire task force of assistants ! concerned with areas like Har-i lem , and a board of top-level officials , the Anti-Poverty Operations Board , empowered , to do something about these ' .. problems . " There is also , of course , a ! major agency , the City ComH mission on Human Rights , deal-j ing with the special problems of discrimination . " Mr. Powell declared that " nob one man " could speak far Har ! lem or the Negroes . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Negro people , not v ' " revolution " by leaders , and that " trouble " could break oath ? " anywhere . " Both Mr , Screvane and Mrd . Powell were applauded by the ! : council members . Mr. Lindsay , who was the ! . first speaker at an all-day meeting of the council . stood a corner of the small , green ? ? walled room to read his state-j , merit to the executive commit- , , tee . ( ) pen Discuslon Urged ' There are some who believe it is unwise to discuss what ' . ! has been called ' the long hotr ! summer , ' on the notion that to ' discuss tensions is to incite : . them , " Mr. Lindsay said . " But apprehensions will not he calmed by silence , nor will problems . be solved by ignoring them . We ' ought to discuss the summer of 1965 candidly , calmly and con ? . structively , " He described his proposals as : ' an extensive and ambitious program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , we must recognize . that the tensions in our slums truly constitute a crisis and to meet it , we must have nothing ' , less than an ambitious and ex- , : tensive program . " Mr. Lindsay said later V. could not estimate the cost of ? his program , but he said it would be " substantially less " than $2,500,000 in property damage caused by the rioting last summer , " Even more important , " be said in his speech , " the cost in human suffering was stagger . ; Mg ; one man killed , 11S police- . men and civilians injured , 165 men and women arrested . The ' setback to the cause of racial harmony was incalculable , ?
