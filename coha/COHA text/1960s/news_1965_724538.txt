txt U. S. Foreign Aid : 1946-1954 EZ World total ? $49.4 bil . 19551964 ( Arrows drawn in proportion to the amount of aid ) AID PROGRAM : The U.S. has beery giving military and economic help to other countries since World War II . This aid in the early years came under a number of programs such as the Truman Doctrine and also in contributions to the United Nations Rehabilitation and Relief Agency . The map and chart below it include all these programs . Massive foreign aid through bilaterial loans and grants began with the Marshall Plan in 1949 , as shown in bottom chart . By FELIX BELAIR ' Jr . Special to The New York Times WASHINGTON , Feb. 6 ? More than at any time since its beginning under the Marshall Plan 15 years ago the foreign aid program is In deep trouble . It is no longer a question of how much President Johnson 's $3.4 billion request may be cut . The wonder now is whether a program of any dimensions can survive the prevailing mood of Congress . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to question the bilateral system of loans and grants conditioned on performance conforming to accepted self-help criteria . They ask just how valid is the premise that the United States advances its own security and well being by financing the revolution of rising expectations in the less developed areas ? The confusion of thought that usually goes with a search for simple answers to complex problems already has produced some strange results . Senatorial indignation over intemperate remarks intended for home consumption by Egypt 's President Gamal Abdel Nasser prompted demands for overhauling the whole foreign aid program , which had nothing to do with Food for Peace shipments then being debated . Close Call In the 42-33 vote that followed , President Johnson was authorized to permit delivery to Egypt , of the surplus food already contracted for . But a switch of three votes would have served notice on ? the world that the President of the United States no longer had a free hand in the exercise of his constitutional responsibility for the nation 's foreign policy . In the House , the same set of circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell , the foreign aid administrator , opened the ' Administration 's case for a $3.4 billion program in the new fiscal year , members of the Foreign Affairs Committee almost to a man offered their congratulations for giving the foreign aid program its most efficient administration in the memory of those present . In Same Breath Almost In the same breath they wanted to know when Mr. Bell was going to " get tough " and " take a stiffer attitude " toward heads of government like President Nasser in Egypt or President Sukarno in Indonesia who had told the United States in political speeches that it could take its aid and " jump in the lake " or " go to hell . " It made no difference that the only aid to those countries over which Mr. Bell had any control in the last two years was for less than $1 million  --  to help stamp out malaria . As the committee chairman , Represe stative Thomas E. Morgan of Pennsylvania , put the matter : " The people of this country are getting awful tired of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little dictators around the world . " The irony in all this was that the criticism of the foreign aid program in the Senate and House was triggered not by anything Mr. Bell had done or failed to do . The real culprit was the Food for Peace program , which has nothing to do with foreign aid as such but began as a device for hiding part of the cost of a profligate farm price support scheme and avoiding storage charges on the surpluses thereby acquired . The central fact about the legislative status of the foreign aid program is that over the years it has become the whipping boy for all the frustrations and provocations with which most Senators and Representatives have to live . There are no rewards for supporters , but plenty of abuse . Criticism of the aid program has mounted as its administration has become more efficient . And the more the Administration prunes its annual asking figure the louder become the demands for a more " selective " program and fox ; concentration of economic loans and grants where they will do the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has some kind of economic aid program operating in 72 countries sticks out like a sore thumb . Nobody seems impressed with the fact that 40 of them receive less than 5 per cent of the economic aid dollars involved . Actually , two-thirds of the $1.275 billion asked by the President for development lending including the Alliance for Progress will go to seven countries . And two-thirds of the $1.17 asked for military aid will go to 11 countries . This would appear to be " concentration " with a vengeance . But because figures can be used to support either side of an argument , critics of the program have calculated that if the Peace Corps and Food for Peace office are added to the list of 72 countries in which A.I.D . has some program , then the Federal Government had some assistance personnel on duty in a total of 90 countries on Jan. 1 . Smallest Ever The President 's over-all request of $3.4 billion was the smallest ever sent to Congress . But reaction to his message centered as much on the fact that this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the record low figure , Granting that more heat than light usually is generated in Congressional debates on the foreign aid program , there are those who have stanchly supported it in the past who now profess grave and legitimate misgivings . These recently have been dramatized by the refusal of Senator J. Fulbright of Arkansas , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , to act as floor manager of the authorizing legislation and by the demand of Senator John Sherman Cooper , Republican of Kentucky , for a year 's moratorium on new aid commitments while the problem is restudied , Senator Fulbright 's reasons for demanding a splitting up of the program into separate economic and military authorizations go much beyond the question of convenience . He is persuaded that dozens of countries are receiving military aid not because of any contribution they might make to the defense of the United States or because of their strategic geography but because there is a political reason for cultivating the generals or admirals or the Government in power . There may be some legitimate political reason for such military aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that program to say they contribute to the national defense . His remedy l5 to put the military aid program in the Defense Department and deprive the State Department of its present over-all authority to initiate military grants to obtain some political adVantage . Much more important to the program as now administered is the Senator 's belief that the present system of making economic development loans and grants based on bilateral agreements with the recipient country has outlived its usefulness . He would turn over any contribution by this country for economic development to international institutions like the World Bank . As Senator Fulbright sees it , the creditor-debtor relationship implicit in the present system can eventually make this country as many detractors as friends . Different Premise Senator Cooper 's demand for a year 's moratorium on further aid authorizations and appropriations springs from a different ' premise . As he sees it , the United States - has " lost control " of its foreign aid to the point where it can no longer be called " our program " because it is " their program . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows : Between 1955 and the end of last year the United States provided Egypt with economic aid totaling just over $1 billion , same $825 million of it in the form of surplus farm commodities . And when , after permitting the burning of a United States Government library in Cairo , stationing his troops in Yemen , trying to deprive this Government of Wheelus Air Force Base in Libya , and providing arms aid to the Congo rebels , President Nasser was urged by the United States to stop these things , he replied : " You are interfering with the internal policies of my country . " Aid to Congo President Nasser continued his arms aid to the Congo rebels . So the United States then had to increase both its military and economic aid to President Moishe Tshombe to combat the rebel insurgents . So we no longer control our own program . In the re-examination of aid policies and practices during the year 's moratorium , Senator Cooper proposes that the President develop a policy that would be applicable to every country . In that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be contiriiied unless used effectively and it Certainly would not be given to countries which used it to supplement their resources for aggression . " If to these ingredients is added the annual demand of . Senator Wayne Morse , Democrat of Oregon , that the foreign aid program be completely overhauled if only for the sake of overhauling , it would appear that its days are indeed numbered . Three more dissimilar Senators would be hard to find . But the politics of foreign aid has made stranger bedfellows . THE CHANGES IN EMPHASIS Total aid : $49.4 bil . ECONOMIC $11 bil .
