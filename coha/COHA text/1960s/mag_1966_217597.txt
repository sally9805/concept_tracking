As commercial television hopelessly wrestles again with mediocrity in entertainment , educational TV is at least trying harder . Latest evidence is a new prime-time adult science series , Experiment , now running on 16 major non commercial channels . <P> Experiment was developed by Don Herbert , 49 , producer and star of the children 's science program Mr. Wizard . <P> That show ran on NBC for 14 years and won a number of prestigious awards be fore NBC capriciously dumped it . It turns out now that the kids ' loss is the grownups ' gain . The opening Experiment and the seven others to follow are modest masterpieces that even the least scientifically minded viewer can find clear and compelling . <P> Each half-hour program deals expertly with one specific scientific advance and the personality of the pioneer who made it possible . " The scientist becomes a protagonist , " says Herbert , " a man with a struggle . " The premiere featured Cornell Zoologist Perry Gilbert and his studies on " Attack Patterns of Sharks . " <P> Other shows follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Secret of the White Cell , " Louisiana Psychologist William Mason in a study of the " Childhood of the Chimpanzee , " and Stanford Physi cist Arthur Schawlow on the mysteries of the " Laser - the Light of the Future . " <P> The most engaging subject is the fourth in the series - Swarthmore Col lege Astronomer Peter van de Kamp , 64 , who in 1963 discovered " Barnard 's Star B , " the first planet outside the solar system . The program opens with Amateur Composer Van de Kamp at the pi ano , playing one of his own works ; then he gets up , kisses his wife goodbye , throws on a scarf , and heads out for a hard night 's day at the observatory , where the camera briskly retraces the hours of patient study that led Van de Kamp to his revolutionary discovery . <P> Simultaneously and without sentimentality , Herbert , who narrates as well as produces Experiment , reveals the whole man - musician , engaging classroom instructor , collector of old Chaplin films , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed when he tried to sell his new series to commercial television . A few ad agen cies and sponsors showed some interest , but they could not entice an appropriate time slot from the big networks . " All those people said they liked it and were sure their families would watch it , " recalls Herbert , " but they were just as sure that ' the masses ' would n't . " With a nationwide chain of 105 educational channels scheduled to telecast the Experiment series by next spring , the masses could - and should-prove them wrong .
