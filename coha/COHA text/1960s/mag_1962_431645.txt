 | The Best Prescription I Know Wise advice from a man who has helped hundreds to overcome problems they thought insurmountable @# AS A PRACTICING psychiatrist , I have listened to just about every human problem under the sun . No two troubles are alike ? human nature is infinitely complex . But the people who come seeking help do have one thing in common . Each is struggling to overcome some problem ? and failing . Usually in the first visit these people blurt out their frustration : " I 've tried everything I can think of , Doctor , everything . What on earth shall I do now ? " The advice I often give these people is quite simple , and it never fails to startle them : " Do n't try ! " Sounds defeatist , does n't it ? Absurd , really . But it is n't . After more than 40 years of practice , it remains the best all-inclusive prescription I know . The reason is this . Within each of us an all-wise Creator has placed a marvelous reservoir of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This reservoir is the subconscious or , more exactly , the unconscious mind . Like a dynamo it furnishes the power and drive of our lives . This power takes many forms . What we call intuition , for example , is nothing but a " still , small voice " from the unconscious . It is also the unconscious that produces for poets , prophets , scientists ? indeed all creative thinkers ? their deepest insights . The power that the unconscious can provide is almost limitless ; we all know of individuals who , in a crisis , were able to perform incredible feats of strength or endurance . But the circuits that bring the power from the unconscious can be blocked by frustration , tension , anxiety ? or by the equally destructive emotions  | if fear , guilt , hate , sustained anger . And that is what is happening to most of the individuals who seek my help . They are fighting so furiously on the conscious level to solve their problems , and are rendered so desperate by their failure that emotionally they have short-circuited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their unconscious , and shown how to use it . Sometimes this is difficult because many are afraid of the uncharted region within and the primitive impulses that lurk there . But such fear is based on ignorance . There is nothing necessarily evil in the unconscious . Even the primitive impulses , understood and rightly channeled , can be used for successful living . But how , then , does a person tap the tremendous reservoir of power that is locked within him ? He must develop habits and attitudes that will unblock and deepen the channels between the conscious and the unconscious mind , and let that power flow . What are these habits and attitudes ? They have a familiar ring , because centuries ago religion identified them and nurtured them in man . First : Trust and believe in the hidden power within you . A psychiatrist might say , " Have faith in your unconscious . " A minister might say , " Have faith in God . " Personally , I see no conflict between the two ideas . Indeed , they may well be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Founder of Christianity who said that " the kingdom of heaven is within you . " Next : Be willing to surrender to it . Get rid of the notion that you are all-powerful , that you can run your life and solve all problems without help from any source . The advice " Do n't try , " after you have tried everything , is an invitation to let go , to give up and let the deeper mind take over . The more complete this surrender , the more remarkable the results . When I was studying the healings at Lourdes some years ago , I noticed that those who were healed ( medically verified healings did take Place ) had reached the absolute end of their resources ? physical , emotional , spiritual . They had done all they could ; the doctors had done all they could ; there was nothing left but total surrender to whatever restorative force resided in God or in their own deeper selves . We know that very often , before an alcoholic can be cured of his obsessive drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not try any more . The illusion of self-sufficiency , or " pride of intellect " as I once heard an old minister call it , has to be shattered and abandoned before the curative forces in the unconscious can go to work . The third bit of advice that I often give to patients ( when I think they may take it ) i perhaps the most effective of all : Try prayer . In prayer , whatever the creed or denomination , one accepts the concept of a Creator who is the source of life and to  | whom one can turn in humility and trust . Here again the surrender of self is the indispensable attitude : " Not my will , but Thine be done . " When this attitude is truly dominant , the results can be astonishing . Whether you choose to call it mobilizing the unconscious or making contact with God , prayer is a channel through which enormous power can flow . When people come to my office seeking help , I sometimes tell them about a friend I had years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman a tornado smashed her home , pinning her in the wreckage and crippling both legs so that for the rest of her life she hobbled about on crutches . But she did all her housework and raised her three children . " Smiley , every night I pray for strength to meet the next day , " she once said to me . " And every morning I pray again , and thank God for my home and husband and children . " Obviously , it took enormous courage and will power to carry on under such circumstances , but Aunt Jo knew how to summon the necessary strength , through prayer . A fourth method of tapping the power in the unconscious is this : Learn the secret of creative relaxation . The psychiatrist 's couch has become a source of endless jokes , but the idea behind it is valid : to reach the unconscious , tension must be at a minimum . Everyone , it seems to me , should have a daily period during which he arranges not to be disturbed , lays aside anxieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious . It is best to lie down , if you can , and make yourself as limp as a wet leaf on a log . If this is not possible , sit in a chair , close your eyes to remove visible distractions , and just " let go . " Such a quiet period , in which the mind says to the body , " Do n't try , " is a great energy restorer during the day , a great tranquilizer before going to sleep at night . If you have problems , you can turn them over to the unconscious to work on while you sleep . And it will work effectively , for it is crammed with information ? all the knowledge you have dropped into it , all the things you have learned during your life and " forgotten . " The unconscious is timeless and it does not forget . A fifth method of releasing the power of the unconscious is : Use autosuggestion . Too much , at times , has been claimed for this ? loudly asserting that problems do n't exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , it is also true that attitudes are more important than facts . And there is no doubt at all that if you consciously look for the best in things instead of the worst , it will act as a tonic for your mind and heart , tending to remove the tensions that stifle the creative unconscious . I knew a man once , a salesman , who literally breathed confidence into himself . By nature he was shy , but he devised a little trick of autosuggestion that worked wonders for  | him . When he approached a prospect , he deliberately listened to the rhythm of his own breathing , then imagined that with every exhalation he was breathing out negative ideas , and with every inhalation breathing in positive ones . " I 'm breathing out shyness , " he would say to himself , " breathing in confidence . I 'm breathing out timidity , breathing in assurance . I 'm breathing out failure , breathing in success . " What he was breathing , of course , was simply air . But his unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in response sent him the very qualities he needed . Every doctor has seen cases in which a desperately ill patient miraculously recovers because his family needs him and he simply decides he is n't going to die . Again the Bible summarizes it with matchless brevity : " As a man thinketh in his heart ( not his conscious mind , notice , but his heart ) so is he . " The thing to remember , then , is this : each of us has , in his unconscious mind , power and strength and courage past all imagining . Sometimes we fail to use this strength because we do n't know it is there . Sometimes we delude our selves into thinking we do n't need it . Sometimes we block it with kar or guilt or tension . But it is most assuredly there . " Do n't try , " ' clearly , is not advice to be given ( or taken ) when a person has made only a half-hearted attempt to help himself or has riot really tried at all . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made with no success , then the best thing to do is to stop struggling and let the great creative forces of the universe come to your rescue . " Having done all , " advised St. Paul , " stand ! " Stand quietly , he meant . Wait . Relax . Accept the help that will come to you out of the mysterious realm that we psychiatrists call the unconscious ? and that St. Paul called God . @#
