MAFEKING by Brian Gardner . 246 pages . Harcourt , Brace &; World . $5.75 . <P> Even at this distance in time , to say anything less than laudatory about the founder of the Boy Scout movement may seem like sneering at motherhood , or burning draft cards . But now that historians are forwarding overdue accounts to the once-Empire , it probably had to happen . Brian Gardner , a young Englishman who has given up journalism for history , deserves a merit badge for his neat hatchet job on Lord Baden-Powell of Gilwell . <P> The world 's first Boy Scout , who won his original fame for his defense of Mafeking during the Boer War , turns out to have been a very shrewd operator indeed . At a time when one bemedaled British generalissimo after another was getting his cavalry pants shot oft by those hairy , puritan Dutch farmers in South Africa , Colonel Baden-Powell turned himself into just the sort of hero his country was yearning for . His own reports about his stand at Mafeking gave the folks at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriotically drunk , and sing God Save the Queen round the pub piano . <P> There was not really all that much to shout about . In October 1899 , by his own inept leadership , Robert Baden-Powell , commander of two regiments of a mobile " frontier force , " succeeded in getting himself bottled up by Boer Commandant-General Piet Cronje . But if he was no military genius , Baden-Powell was an unquestioned success at public relations . During 217 days of siege , the dispatches from Mafeking were masterpieces of jocose understatement . Baden-Powell wrote some himself and censored those written by war correspondents . Either way , the adoring British public swallowed the stories avidly . They read of the jaunty commander braving the " inconveniences " of the siege , and they imagined horrors worse than the siege of Lucknow . Over the long weeks , as 2,000 shells fell among the widely dispersed and well-dug-in defenders , Baden-Powell thoughtfully changed the figure to 20,000 , and his admirers at home worried all the more . <P> Extravagant for Alexander . Now and then , Baden-Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much of the time he engaged in games , sketching and composing his fanciful reports to London . It seemed almost a pity when a column under Colonel Bryan ( " The Mahout " ) Mahon rode into town to effect the celebrated relief . The whole Empire went gaga . In London , " Mafeking Night " lasted five days . It was , writes Gardner , " a vast and apparently uncontrollable upsurge of joy , nationalism , and mended pride . " <P> Thanks partly to Baden-Powell 's own gift for projecting a heroic image and partly to the ineffectual tactics of Boer General Cronje , Baden-Powell was made the youngest major general in the British army . His military prowess was acclaimed in terms that would have been extravagant for Alexander of Macedon . He retired in 1910 after an otherwise uneventful military career . But no matter , he made a swell founder of the Boy Scouts .
