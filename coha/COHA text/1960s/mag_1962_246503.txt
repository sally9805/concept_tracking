For the Jewish community in the historic German city of Worms , a commonplace ceremony this Sabbath takes on special significance . A 13-year-old boy , Ilan Walzer , will be ushered into manhood at his bar mitzvah , and though the rite elsewhere is primarily an occasion for rejoicing by family and friends , to Worms it means that the city will now have ten adult Jewish males , the number set by Talmudic law as the minimum for a Jewish congregation . The Jews of Worms already had a synagogue ; last month Vice Chancellor Ludwig Erhard and other West German dignitaries attended the dedication of a new $125,000 structure , which replaced a medieval synagogue gutted by the Nazis in 1938 . But the city 's Jewish community , once 1,200 strong , is so small that until this week it could not even provide the essential " tenth man . " <P> Hitler 's Monument . Today Worms and all of Germany ( West and East ) are as Hitler intended , largely judenfrei-free of Jews . Before the advent of the Third Reich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; German life and art were immeasurably enriched by the work of such Jews as Physicist Albert Einstein and Composer Kurt Weill . Thousands fled the Nazis ; thousands more died in the concentration camps . There are now no more than 30,000 Jews-including some 5,000 who escaped from Eastern Europe-among West Germany 's 55 million people , and only 1,900 among East Germany 's 17 million . <P> In most of the 73 German cities and towns where Jews live , worship rooms in community centers take the place of synagogues . There are only a dozen rabbis in the country , and no theological seminary to provide new ones . <P> A characteristically wry Jewish joke is that the Germans have reached the point of forgiving the Jews for what the Germans did to them . Despite occasional outbursts of anti-Semitism-three weeks ago rowdies toppled most of the gravestones in the Jewish cemetery at Barsinghausen - Germany 's Christians have made many amends . The West German government has paid out $3.4 billion in postwar reparations to the worldwide Jewish community ( with $2 billion more still to come ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thirty-one German societies promote Christian-Jewish friendship . <P> " We Can Never Be Friends . " Dachau and Buchenwald loom large in Jewish memories : one householder suspected that his surly postman was an unreconstructed Nazi , only to discover that the man was a lifelong socialist who had spent years interned in a concentration camp . Most of the German-born Jews who fled abroad have refused to return home , and the few who have come back are cautious still . " We work together with the Germans , " says the production manager of a clothing firm in West Berlin , " but we can never be friends . They either feel guilty about what they did to us , or they are sorry to see any of us still here . "
