" Man , how things have changed , " says Flanker Pete Gent of the Dallas Cowboys . " When I joined this club two years ago , nobody did anything but jeer at us . If there was a crowd waiting at the airport when we returned from a game , we figured they had ropes . " To day , a huge electric sign in downtown Dallas proclaims , HOME OF THE COW BOYS - WORLD 'S FASTEST TEAM , and in the Cotton Bowl last week 80,000 fans turned out to watch their heroes beat the Cleveland Browns 26-14 for their eighth victory of the season ( against two losses , one tie ) and take over first place in the National Football League 's Eastern Conference . <P> <P> Quite a turnabout , indeed , for a team that sold only 1,914 season tickets in 1961 , and never has enjoyed a winning season in its six-year history . The turnabout is especially sweet for Don Meredith , 28 , who has been a Cowboys ' quarterback ever since he graduated from Southern Methodist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse . <P> " The first time I was ever booed in my life was with the Cowboys , " says Meredith . " But I guess that 's part of growing up as a pro quarterback . " Against Cleveland last week , Meredith completed 16 out of 24 passes for 131 yds. and one touchdown-and walked off the field to a standing ovation . <P> The Whole Gauntlet . The Dallas offense that Meredith directs is probably the most complicated in pro football . " We run the whole gauntlet , " says Coach Tom Landry . " We use double wings , triple wings , a two-back formation , backs in motion to the strong side and the weak side-in other words , everything . " To carry the ball , the Cowboys can call on Fullback Don Perkins , a stumpy ( 5 ft. 10 in. , 210 lbs. ) speedster who gained 111 yds. against the Browns , or Halfback Dan Reeves , who runs , says <P> Landry , " just fast enough to get over the goal line " - and has already scored 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have Flanker Gent , a 6-ft. 4-in. jumping jack , and Split End Bob Hayes , the world-record holder ( at 9.1 sec. ) in the 100-yd. dash . <P> For all that offense , defense has been Landry 's real specialty ever since he bossed the New York Giants ' famed defensive brigade in the late 1950s . The Cowboys ' ferocious defense , bulwarked by 255-lb . Tackle Bob Lilly , ranks No. 1 in the N.F.L. in nine separate categories . They have held their opponents to only 228 yds. per game-71 yds. on the ground . Enemy quarterbacks have completed only 45% of their passes against the Cowboys , and they have been dumped for losses 39 times . " We seem to have become a very strong team , " says Landry-who should be a shoo-in for Understater of the Year .
