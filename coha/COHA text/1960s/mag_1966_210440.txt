WHEN TIME WAS BORN by James T. Farrell. 64 pages . The Smith . $3.50 . <P> James T. Farrell is the most heroic figure in modern American letters . No one else , in the face of such resolute popular and critical discouragement for so many years , would persist with unsullied vocation so doggedly and prolifically in the lonely and exacting art of fiction . His unrequited passion for literature must be the most gallantly unfortunate affair since an emperor penguin fell in love with Admiral Byrd ( and followed him around , hinting with gifts of egg-shaped stones that he would like to join the Navy ) . <P> Farrell calls his latest literary enterprise a prose poem . It is neither prose nor poem , but it appears to be an attempt to rewrite the first chapters of the Book of Genesis . The first sentence blithers and blathers and blunders along for five pages and 1,390 words . Reading it can only be likened to the experience of a man who , having lost an election bet , has undertaken to eat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpalatable-the steel-wool structure or the pink soapy filling . Sample Farrell : " Time moved slowly backwards through more than one thousand nine hundred and twenty years of A.D. , and five thousand years of B.C. , through all of the years and years of the Jewish calendar . . . before Hector was a pup , through the Neolithic and Paleolithic ages , back through and before the Darwin man , the Dover man , Pithecanthropus Erectus , and all of the fathers of the fathers . . . " <P> King James , who got to have his name on the end papers of the most widely read English Scripture , had the humility to seek the collaboration of 47 bishops and scholars in producing his eponymous Version . James T. Farrell collaborates with no one , least of all the reader ; his version of the Creation was written in 20 consecutive hours . The anonymous contributing bishops who struggled with the Bible took a little more time .                    @
