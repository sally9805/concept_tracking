14 ? ..... 40 ? THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes . and Cornmcnt RECENTLY , we have found ourself preoccupied by a Strangelovean dilemma : Suppose the United States ( or Russia or Paraguay or Albania or Upper Volta or ... 1 were to invent the perfect deterrent ( presumably in secret , although if it were the perfect deterrent this should n't matter much ) ; how could we convince anyone ( Russia or Paraguay or ... ) that we had invented it ? Because if we could n't convince anyone , then , perfect though it might be , it would n't be a deterrent at all . To put it another way , suppose we had rzoi invented the perfect deterrent but had invented something ; what should we claim we had invented , and how should we claim it , so that it would act most like a deterrent ? Or , to put it still another way , how could we even know , ourselves , that we had invented a deterrent  --  if , indeed , we had Because the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are deterred , " and it might he lying . ( In the case of deterrents , action , or non-action , does n't necessarily speak louder than words , since the past is not necessarily a precedent . ) A case in point is the current missile crisis ( or anti-missile crisis , depending on which way you look at it ) . The Russians have apparently invented an anti-missile something . Or , if they have n't , we think ( or someone thinks ) they have , and in the deterrent business that is what really cuts the mustard . This constitutes a " crisis , " we are told , because if whatever it is that the Russians have invented were to cause them to stop believing in our deterrent  --  a loss of " deterrent credibilit ) " ? they would no longer be deterred . Indeed , the people who are charged with the responsibility of thinking about these things for all of us have said that the only rational way we can respond to this crisis , if that is what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the efficacy of their inventionand consequently have lost a certain amount of faith in the efficacy of ours . If this is so , the responsible people argue , then we must respond by making new inventions , or , anyway , by convincing the Russians that we have made new inventions , because if they are convinced , we will have redeemed our deterrent credibility and , presumably , can all feel a lot safer . The only trouble with this is : How can we tell whether we have convinced Mem ? That 's part of the dilemma . THERE is a good deal to be said for the practice , especially common in sports telecasts , of the instant replay  --  showing a scene again , often in slow motion , a moment or two after it has actually taken place . The instant replay gives the viewer time to reflect on what he has just seen and heard , and often results in his putting an entirely different interpretation upon an event that he thought was perfectly clear in his mind the first time around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many directions ( mostly warlike ) , the possibility of a pause for reflection , however slight , is a possibility worth exploring . VTe are in favor of almost anything that will slow things ( mostly warlike ) down for a while , and the instant replay may do the trick . Ve would be in favor of an instant replay of , for example , every moment , on whatever station and at whatever hour , in which someone spoke the word " peace . " Let a chap say " peace " in the middle of a Senate hearing or a comedy routine , or even a commercial , and standing orders would require that that moment he replayed instantly . " Peace " would he breaking out all over the place morning , noon , and night . The constant repetition of the word " peace " might conceivably force all of us to think about the word , rather than just use it .

There could he worse situations , Preservation TN 1903 , the Herald ran an article 1 . noting that " when private homes in Harlem arc spoken of , it is invariably the Mount Morris Park section which comes in for first comment . " The article continued , " It is an attractive residential district still , but hardly what it used to be in the clays when there inhabited it some of the leading lights of Tammany Hall , and when Mount Morris Park itself buzzed with political talk as the sachems gathered there on the benches in the cool evenings . Some prominent men still live there .... The houses bordering the park arc mostly four-story brownstone front dwellings , as sombre and respectable as anything that the Fifth Avenue section can show . They never lack tenants , but not so large a percentage of them is occupied by owners as was the case ten years ago . " In the past sixty years , this neighborhood has undergone several transitions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks to the west of the . park a historic district , whereupon we went up to 120th Street and Lenox Avenue to have a look at the community and discover what has come to pass there since the sachems gathered on its benches in the cool evenings . Two staff members of the Commission , Michael Gold and John Bayley , joined us , and the Reverend Dr. Eugene Adair , whose church , the Mt . Morris Presbyterian , is in the district , and whose house is one of the district 's handsomest landmarks , volunteered to act as our guide . On the steps of the church , which stands on the corner of Mt . Morris Park West and West 122nd Street , facing the park , Dr. Adair told us that the hill in the center of the park had been called Slang Berg , or Snake Hill , by the Dutch , because in their time it was infested with rattlers , and that in 1776 , the rattlers having presumably scattered to parts unknown , the Hessians were able to stop a detachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting up a cannon at the top of the hill , which dominated the mouth of the river . Dr. Adair , a short , round , partly bald man with an ebullient manner , had kept one hand against the door of the church as he talked , and now , clearly bursting with enthusiasm , he led us inside . " I 've got a Head Start Center , a Day Care Center , and a Senior Citizens group going in the annex , " he said , chuckling . " But they wo n't get in our way if we do n't get in theirs . " The main part of the building , which was empty , was quiet except for Dr. Adair 's voice , which carried warmly around the room . He told us that the church was built in 1905 and was then called the Harlem-New York Presbyterian Church . Its membership was all white and included a number of city notables , he said . Near the end of that decade , the families in the area began moving to New jersey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther downtown , on West End Avenue . For some years , the old church stood empty . " In 1942 and ' 43 , I was a student at Colombia , and I had no dreams , " Dr. Adair said . " I was just a boy up from Chester , South Carolina , who was going back home after he got his degree . Then , one day , the head of Union Theological Seminary , the Reverend Dr. Henry Sloane Coffin , asked me if I would like to start a Sunday school in Harlem . He gave me the keys to this empty church , which I had never seen , and I came over and opened it up . The first thing I noticed was this big , beautiful three-manual organ , but when I touched the keys nothing happened . Dry rot had settled in . So I left the organ alone , and went out and bought some oranges and apples and things . Then I walked through the streets , more or less bribing the kids to come in . A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son  --  at night while my wife did war work at Western Electric , and then a few of the other mothers who were working in defense plants decided that old Rev. could take care of their children , too . " He paused to stifle a chuckle . " Well , I told them , You bring the food  --  oatmeal , cornflakes , any leftovers you have  --  and I 'll do what I can . ' So , all day and all night , I had about a hundred and sixty kids here . My son , who is now in medical school , slept in a Rinso carton . " After a few more chuckles , Dr. Adair continued , " We 've had our troubles , though . In 1948 , the hurricane blew out some of the windows . Vie did n't have any insurance , and the cost of replacing them was put at something like five thousand dollars . We went out on the street on Thanksgiving Day and got people to help . Some gave bricks , some gave labor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursed this building through thick and thin , and somehow , in the meantime , I got my Master 's degree in education , and I forgot about going back to Chester . " Dr. Adair told us that in the twenty-five years he has been with the church his congregation has grown to four hundred members , the organ has been renovated , and once a year the daughters of four of the church 's old white families come back to worship . " Look , " he said abruptly . " I could spend the rest of the day telling you stories about this place . I just love it . But come on , I want to show you the house . " The house , which is around the corner on 122nd Street , had just been bought , for twenty-six thousand dollars , by the At-lairs , we learned . ( Mrs. Adair is a professor of education at Queens College , and they now have three children . ) Before this purchase , they had lived for twenty-four years on the top floor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we wish to preserve , " Mr. Bayley said , taking a quick glance around as our group walked along . " There 's a whole architectural museum in these two blocks . Over there " ? he looked in the direction of a small apartment building ? " you can see the influence of Viollet-le-Duc in that terra-cotta roof . He was n't a very good architect , but then there was a lot of random copying going on in this country during the nineteen-thirties . That is why you have this whole lovable mishmash of neoGrecque and neo-Romanesque , and things like the mansard roof on that building over there . " For a few minutes , we all stood contemplating the lovable mishmash . Then Dr. Adair pointed to the house at 4 West 122nd Street . He told us that it was the home of Dr. Cyril Dolly , a physician from the West Indies , who had bought it in 1943 . One of its many distinctions was that it was once the residence of a Morgenthau who had a penchant for stained-glass windows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but had decided to keep the windows after he found out that at least one of them was valued at over two thousand dollars . " Except for the windows , our house is just like Dr. Dolly 's , " Dr. Adair said , walking on . His wife , he added , was taking care of the interior decorating and had been shopping all over the Eastern Seaboard for the right pieces . " I have n't started to count the rooms , " he said as we all entered the house . " But I think there are twelve . I know that there are four floors , seven working fireplaces , and real bronze curtain rods . The thing I like about this place is that everything works . " Dr. Adair ushered everybody straight upstairs to the top floor and then down through the house ; in the upstairs rooms we saw ornate hand-carved mantelpieces , small anterooms with washbasins sunk in sheets of marble , and a demonstration by Dr. Adair of the efficiency of some new gas logs in the fireplace in his bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the kitchen was , and where we found Mrs. Adair , a perky and attractive woman , heating water for tea on a large black wood-horning stove , which came with the house . Before we left , we stepped out into the hack yard to take a look at the heginnings of a flower garden , which Mrs. Adair had starred working on before the family moved in . The yard next to theirs was bare , and Dr. Adair said that the occupants of the next-door house , an elderly couple , had moved away and that the contents of the house  --  brass beds , lace curtains , wooden bathtubs , and such  --  had been loaded onto a dump truck and hauled off before anyone could rescue them . The house directly behind their own , he said , was a rooming house . " That 's the problem with a neighborhood like ours , " he continued as our group made its way hack to the street . " So much of it is rooming houses , and who 's going to take pride in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gold , nodding , said that one of the henefits of having a neighborhood declared a historic district was that any changes made in it must be carried out under the guidance of the architects and historians on the Commission 's staff . " That will he particularly good for a neighborhood like this one , " he said as we all walked along Lenox Avenue past a row of pink-and-gray houses ( Ve netian Gothic , according to Mr. Bayley ) . " If Harlem is ever going to come hack , it will he in this way  --  through the upgrading of its run-down old buildings , and through the maintenance of its fine old houses , like Dr. Dolly 's and Dr. Adair 's . " Before heading hack downtown , we walked a hit farther and stopped briefly to look at some churches  --  Mt . Olivet Baptist , St. Martin 's Episcopal , Ephesus Seventh-Day Adventist , Ebenezer Gospel Tabernacle , a storefront Church of God , and an A.M.E. Zion Church . Mr. Gold , who had accompanied us , told us of two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few blocks to the north , containing row houses designed by McKim , Mead &; White , and , still farther north , the Hamilton Heights Historic District , including Hamilton Grange , the home of Alexander Hamilton . We decided to save those for another day . Small World Art MAN we know has repoed that on a recent Air France flight from Tel Aviv to Athens he was pleas-antly surprised to hear the voice on the loudspeaker remark , " Mesdames et Messieurs , dans quelques instants ? IOUS FLDIUJARY 2 5 , 19 6 7 survolerons Pile de Rhodes , " pause a moment , and then say , " Ladies and gentlemen , in a few minutes we will be passing over Rhode Island . " Two People bi a Room HAROLD PINTER , the English playwright , is living on Fifth Avenue , in the Seventies , during the Broadway run of his twelfth , and latest , play , " The Homecoming . " With his wife , Vivien Merchant , who is acting in the play , and their nine-year-old son Daniel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hundreds of somebody else 's hooks along a wall of built-in bookshelves , and things like mahogany sculpture , ivory miniatures under glass , and antique gilt-trimmed ebony tables . A picture window in the living room offers a blinding panoramic view of most of Central Park and miles of skyline , We called on Mr. Pinter in his apartment one afternoon last week , while his wife and sun were attending the Dog Show . ? ? A handsome , amiable-looking man of thirty-six with black hair , black sideburns , and eyeglasses that are rimmed with horn on top and colorless plastic on the bottom , Mr. Pinter was wearing house slippers , black trousers , and a pale-blue shirt , open at the collar , with French cuffs and onyx cufflinks . He pointed out a small shelf of books in the foyer and said he had brought most of those books with him from England , along with his Olympia portable typewriter . The Olympia , uncovered , stood on an ebony table facing the view . There were fourteen of his own books : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " La Maisun de Remdez-vaius , " by Alain Robbe-Grillet ; " Plain Pleasures , " by Jane Bowles ; " Casualties of Peace , " by Edna O'Brien ; " A Delicate Balance , " by Edward Albee ; " Story of 0 ; " " The Man in the Glass Booth , " by Robert Shaw ; " The New Poetry , " edited by A. Alvarez ; " The Poems of John Donne ; " " Love Poems , " by Thomas Hardy ; " The Less Deceived , " by Philip Larkin ; " The ' Whitson Weddings , " by Philip Larkin ; and " The Selected Letters of Dylan Thomas . " Mr. Pinter told us that he and his family liked the apartment and thought the view quite beautiful , especially at night . " I find myself in a little bit of a trance in New York , " he said " Occasionally , I roll down the Avenue in a taxi , and I realize : ' I am in New York . ' I 've been here for six weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't done a thing here . When we were in Boston with The Homecoming , ' I started working on a new play . I had started something . It was there . On a few pieces of paper . It was just born . I enjoy writing when I can manage it . But it becomes more and more difficult . In the last five years , apart from all the considerable distractions and extra demands of life the telephone , the correspondence , new productions , correcting prooIs , turning down invitations to go to Timbuctoo and give a lecture , all that  --  I find that writing has become more demanding . I 've been at it ten years , but in the last five years , quite apart from the question of time , the writing itself has been more difficult . Writing my first play , The Room , ' was comparatively easy . Now that I 'm ten years older , I 've become more aware of my limitations . When I was thirteen and started writing poetry , I had quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of Dylan Thomas then , and I did n't care a damn what the hell was going on . As I 've got older , I 've developed a. concern for economy and discipline . " We asked him where he lives in England . " London  --  Regent 's Park , " he replied . " Right in the park . In a very beautiful Nash house . Built in 1820 . It 's a very tall house  --  five floors  --  and it looks over the lake . My wife has a remarkable talent for decoration . We THE NEW YORKER 35 put in bathrooms and kitchens . All that . And plumbing and electricity . The drawing rowan , in the first floor , is forty feet long . Very classical . It 's a very calm house .

In the morning , when I take my son to school , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we pass extraordinary hostile geese . Driving is faster , but it 's nice to walk through the park . Life at home has another kind of rhythm . " We asked Mr. Pinter whether he had grown up near Regent 's Park , and be said no that he was born ( on October 10 , 193(1) , and had grown up , in Hackney , in the East End of London . His father , Jack Pinter , who is now retired , was a ladies ' tailor , with a small shop , also in Hackney . " I lived in a brick house on Thistlewaite Road , near Clapton Pond , which had a few ducks in it , " he said . " It was a working-class area  --  some big , run-down Victorian houses , and soap factories with a terrible smell , and a lot of railway yards . And shops . It had a lot of shops . But down the road a hit from our house there was a river , the Lea River , which is a tributary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two miles you find yourself in a marsh . And near a filth ) canal as well . There is a terrible factory of some kind , with an enormous dirty chimney , that shoves things down to this canal . " We asked Mr. Pinter to tell us about his childhood . " My mother was a marvellous cook , as she still is , " he said . " M3 father worked terribly hard . He worked a twelve-hour day , making clothes in his shop , but eventually he lost the business and went to work for someone else . In the war , he was an air-raid warden . When I was nine , was evacuated to the country . I went to a castle in Cornwall  --  owned by a Mrs. Williams with twentyfour other boys . It had marvellous grounds . And it was on the sea . It looked out on the English Channel , and it had kitchen gardens . All that . But it was n't quite so idyllic as it sounds , because I was quite a morose little bo ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over four hundred miles there and hack , and I do n't know how they made it . It was terribly expensive , and they had no money . I came home after a year or so , and then I went away again  --  this time with any mother  --  to a place closer to London . On the day I got back to London , in 1944 , I saw the first flying bomb . I was in the street , and I saw it come over . It looked like a tin ) airplane . It was an innocent-looking thing . It just chugged along . And then I saw it come down . There were times when I would open our back door and find our garden in flames . Our house never burned , but we had to evacuate several times . Every time we evacuated , I took my cricket hat with me . " " What was the name of your school ? " we asked . " The Hackney Downs Grammar School , " he said . " It was a ten-minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . It was a good building . It was pretty awful , but it had great character , and some of the masters had , too . Especially my English master , Joseph Brearley . He 's a very brilliant man . He 's a great fellow . He 's still there . He was obsessed with the theatre . I played Macbeth when I was sixteen , and he directed me , and then he directed me when I played Romeo . I went in for football and cricket at school , and I was always chosen to run . My main ability was sprinting . I set a new school record  --  a hundred yards in ten point two  --  hut it 's been broken since . The only universities I was thinking about were Oxford and Cambridge . But you had to know Latin , and I did n't know Latin . I went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art , but I left after three months . I did n't care for it . I was out of my element there . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very sophisticated there . And then I was full of contempt for so many things in those days . I 'm not as full of contempt now . It 's very difficult to feel contempt for others when you see yourself in the mirror . I have a certain sympathy for an-self , but it 's modified . I bore myself a great deal . The fact of myself overwhelms me by its tediousness . Dragging Yourself around day after day is a hell of a burden . I can be full of high
