txt " Radio hooligans " who clutter the ether with jazz and vulgar language have been criticized by the Baku Worker , daily newspaper of the Azerbaijan Republic . With names such as " tuneyadets " ( parasite ) , " black cat , " or " flying skeleton , " unauthorized radio stations suddenly come on , the newspaper complains in an issue dated Aug. 6 . " An impudent voice announces : ' I am broadcasting a concert of jazz music for everybody , ' and then continues , ' Attention . Attention . I am broadcasting two songs recorded from the Voice of America . ' " Amateur radio designing is a popular hobby in the Soviet Union . Participants include people from many walks of life  --  students , apprentice engineers , collective farmers , school children . The hobby is officially encouraged with events such as the recent all-union exhibition of amateur radio designers . But builders of radio sets must abide by strict rules  --  their stations must be licensed and wave-lengths authorized . Apparently , however , the relative simplicity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When caught , the operators receive penalties ranging from a simple fine and confiscation of transmitters to five years in prison . It seems that these penalties have not sufficed to deter " radio hooliganism , " not only in Azerbaijan but in other parts of the Soviet Union . The Baku Worker complained that such " hooligans " could cause loss of life by interrupting plane-to-airfield or ship-to-shore communications , or other vital messages . The Baku Worker cited the case of a group of " radio hooligans , " who , not content to " litter the ether " by themselves , decided to form a committee " uniting all radio hooligans who possess unregistered transmitting devices . " An individual known as " V. Agapov on earth , and ' Hawk ' in the ether " was elected chairman at a secret meeting held in the village of Razin . " It . is natural that the ' committee ' did not last for long , " said the newspaper . " Its officials had to take their seats in the dock . " It did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but said that " everybody who tries to turn the ether into an area for hooliganism , if not to say subversion , will be brought to strict punishment .
