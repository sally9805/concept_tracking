Rhino ! is a brilliantly scenic , instructive , timely and entertaining tale of African adventure . The hero ( Robert Gulp ) is a zoologist who dedicates his skills to the preservation of African wildlife ; the villain ( Harry Guardino ) is a poacher who devotes his energies to their annihilation . Told that the villain is an excellent guide , the hero in all innocence hires him to hunt down a pair of rare white rhinos and transport them to a game preserve , where they may safely multiply . The villain , of course , secretly intends to make off with the hero 's pharmic rifle , a device that fires hypodermic darts , and bag the rhinos for a fence who has promised him $20,000 for the pair . <P> This standard situation gets anything but standard treatment from Director Ivan Tors and his two scriptwriters ( Art Arthur and Arthur Weiss ) . They have moderated melodrama to the requirements of realism , and they have punctuated their safari with some glorious fun . The episode in which the friendly enemies get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boondocks in search of a lone leopard ( " You take uh one on uh lef , pal , an ' I 'll take uh one on uh right " ) is one of the sappiest hunting scenes ever written . Thanks mostly to the vivid work of the principal players , the central characters come off as wonderfully real and specific people , so much themselves that they could n't possibly be anybody else . <P> Rhino ! , however , is not fundamentally a picture about people . It is a picture about animals and the latest techniques of stalking and taking them . The processes and instruments-dart guns , synthesized animal odors , tiny transmitters attached to the quarry 's body-are studied in detail . And the animals themselves are examined almost incessantly with wonder and with love . They are all there-hippos that seem to hang by their eyes from the water 's surface , gazelles that dart above the grasslands like big , golden bees , leopards that grow on trees like spotted , alarming fruit-and they are there in hundreds . But perhaps the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a visit from the zoologist , rises with indomitable dignity and turns his back to the curious camera . Startling indeed to see the King of Beasts with a neat little Band-Aid on his backside .
