In 1877 , Alphonso Taft was Attorney General in the Cabinet of fellow Ohioan Ulysses S. Grant , and Patrick Gilligan , recently arrived in Cincinnati from Ireland 's Sligo County , began a mortuary business . Cincinnati 's Taft dynasty in succeeding generations occupied an ever more commanding role in the Republican Party and U.S. politics . The Gilligans also prospered in their chosen field . <P> It was not until Patrick 's great-grandson John Joyce Gilligan decided to run for Congress in 1964 that the two families ' destinies converged . Jack Gilligan not only beat the Taft-ruled organization 's candidate , Representative Carl Rich , but in his re-election race this fall is running against Alphonso 's great-grandson , Robert Taft Jr. , grandson of a U.S. President , son of Mr. Republican . <P> Innovations . In his battle to hold the First Congressional District-covering the eastern half of Cincinnati and Hamilton County-Gilligan bucks more than Taft tradition . He owed his election two years ago to the Goldwater debacle and is only the third Democrat to be elected from the district in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Bob Taft , 49 , has more impressive credentials than his illustrious name . Elected four times to the Ohio house of representatives , where he served as the Republican floor leader , he won his first statewide race in 1962 to become Congressman-at-large and would almost certainly have been elected to the U.S. Senate in 1964 save for the Lyndon landslide . Taft 's chances have been boosted this year by the presence on the ticket of a popular Republican incumbent , Governor James Rhodes , and the fact that the First District has been reapportioned and is more heavily Republican than ever . <P> Yet it is a tight race . In less than two years , redhaired , blue-eyed Jack Gilligan , who never really stopped campaigning , has earned a reputation to match the motto on his placard : " The Congressman who gets things done . " He opened a local office , started a newsletter-both innovations in the district - and even put out reports in Braille . He arranged free junkets to Washington for high school students and brought delegations of Washington officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Making of a Soph . Most effective of all , Gilligan was the first to announce the news of every federal financial grant or industrial contract of benefit to his constituency , whether he had anything to do with it or not . As a loyal supporter of Lyndon Johnson and one of those Democratic freshmen that Johnson would like to make sophomores , Gilligan had plenty to report . Some items : a $750 million defense contract for a local plant , $4.7 million for a housing project , $285,000 to help convert the old Union Station into a museum . For a number of such boons , he claimed personal credit , notably State Department sponsorship of a world tour by the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra .
