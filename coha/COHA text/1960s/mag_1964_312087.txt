The Christian Century , which used to take pride in being " An Undenominational Weekly " and now takes equal pride in being " An Ecumenical Weekly , " will soon have a new editor . Stepping down is scholarly Harold E. Fey ( rhymes with sky ) , 65 , whose zesty crusades and courageous sacred-cow punching have made Chicago-published Century a well-read and well-heeded organ of Christian unity since he succeeded the late Paul Hutchinson in 1956 . Fey says , tongue in cheek : " Our editors retire at 65 because Dr. Hutch inson did . I believe he was right . Old men often get irresponsible because they know they will not be there to bear the consequences . " <P> Following Fey , who leaves in August to begin teaching at the Christian Theological Seminary in Indianapolis , is Managing Editor Kyle Haselden , 51 , a former Baptist minister turned journalist . Haselden for his part plans to continue wading right in where controversy is the deepest . Says he : " We want not only to report what is happening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be critical of the ecumenical movement from within the movement itself . We are not going to shoot arrows from Mount Olympus. "
