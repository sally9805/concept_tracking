Renaissance artists prided themselves on their mastery of perspective , which could make a flat-surfaced painting seem to recede into infinity ; cubist painters warped the lines of sight to show several sides of the same object on a flat canvas . Today , younger artists are finding that they need even more room to explore their illusive imagery . The results are constructions ( see color ) that fall somewhere between two-dimensional painting and three-dimensional sculpture . The artists might best be described as working in 21 dimensions . <P> Space Reporters . For the U.S. 's John Willenbecher , 31 , the extra half-dimension grows out of his enthusiasm for the space age . As a boy , he spent hours gazing through his telescope at the heavens ; today his Manhattan studio is plastered with NASA moon photos and maps of outer space . His constructions are essentially intended as windows looking out of the world to a celestial view beyond . His Spheremusic #2 , currently on display at New York 's Whitney Museum , combines shining globes in concentric circles , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is the symbol of the infinite , of geometry , of an infinite continuum . " <P> Belgium 's Paul Van Hoeydonck , 41 , is another artist who finds " Cape Kennedy the most romantic place on earth . " His subject , too , is space .

He paints them all pure white , he explains , " because white symbolizes infinity and mystery . " <P> Van Hoeydonck 's panoramas are meant to show the effluvia that will float past the porthole or radar screens of future capsules en route to distant galaxies . In Radar #V , he covers the view with a layer of colored Plexiglas partly because it creates a bloodcurdlingly realistic mood of objects adrift on an uncharted sea . Van Hoeydonck maintains that he is not trying to frighten people . " All I 'm trying to do , " he says , " is be a kind of reporter of the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of Mary Bauermeister , 32 , is far more subtle and complex because her subject is not the wide blue yonder but subjective space-the difference between seeing and remembering , between appearances and reality . The daughter of a Cologne genetics and anthropology professor , she works today in the U.S. , building extraordinary constructions that combine lines and squiggles , notes and letters , painted wood hemispheres and optical-glass lenses that jiggle and twist the viewer 's eye as he walks by .
