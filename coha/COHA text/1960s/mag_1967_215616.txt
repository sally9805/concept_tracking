Each day a woman hangs out her wash to dry alongside one of the myriad branches of the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos . This innocent-looking domestic scene is of particular interest to U.S. reconnaissance pilots , who daily " go around the corner " - their lingo for their semisecret flights over neutral Laos-to check on the lady 's wash . When no laundry is on the line , that is a signal from the sharp-eyed housekeeper that North Vietnamese troops or trucks are moving near by . Within minutes after the pilots notice that the wash is not out , U.S. planes are raining bombs down upon the Communists . <P> The washerwoman spy is but a tiny part of a vast , largely secret U.S. , Vietnamese and Royal Laotian effort to detect , deter and destroy the primary funnel through which North Vietnamese men and materiel head for South Viet Nam . The Ho Chi Minh trail , a 200-mile " logistical wonder " according to U.S. officials , is a massive maze of roads , bridges , waterways and paths complete with primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with crushed stone or topped with pressed laterite . Camouflages of bamboo and branch roof it over where the jungle canopy is balding . Bridges are often built 6 inches under water so that they will be difficult to spot from the air . <P> Company Strikes . Some 5,000 to 8,000 men a month go down the network of trails to fight in South Viet Nam , though of late the traffic has largely been in supplies . To keep the roads open under the daily bombing , Hanoi employs a large assortment of heavy earth-moving equipment at night , plus the labor of some 40,000 coolies . An estimated 5,000 trucks ply the trail , but bicycles and even elephants are also used . Some 25,000 North Vietnamese troops are stationed in Laos to guard the vital Red flow southward . Where traffic is heaviest , the North Vietnamese have even set up antiaircraft batteries . <P> In what the Communists call " the special war , " the Allies in a variety of ways monitor and attack the North Vietnamese operating in Laos . The trail runs through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communist Pathet Lao under Hanoi 's tutelage , but Royal Laotian patrols infiltrate to report on trail traffic . From South Viet Nam come reconnaissance patrols of Vietnamese , Montagnard and Nung tribesmen , or of U.S. Special Forces led by local guides . Occasionally , when a Communist troop concentration is firmly fixed , South Vietnamese units as large as a company slip across for a swift , unpublicized strike . But the main job of harassment is carried out by the Royal Laotian Air Force 's 25-odd prop-driven T-28 fighter-bombers and U.S. jets out of Thailand , which bomb the heavy traffic on the trail around the clock under the euphemism of " armed reconnaissance .
