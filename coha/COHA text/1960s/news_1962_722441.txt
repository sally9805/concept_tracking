txt Only 4% of the 300.000 manufacturing firms in the U.S. sell their products abroad . But William S. Krason. a big . smiling 44-year-old who serves as the Commerce Department 's chief trade representative in the bustling West German industrial city of Dusseldorf , is doing his best to boost the percentage . Mr. Krason is one of an army of overseasbased U.S. trade promoters charged with carrying out the Administration 's beefed-up campaign to increase American export sales In the Government 's 1961 fiscal year . tips on possible export opportunities gathered by Mr. Krason 's office were instrumental in selling at least $6.4 million worth of U.S. products in the Dusseldorf area . including boat equipment , roller bearings , machine parts and frozen poultry . And the total for the year ending June 30 is certain to be higher . Uncle Sam 's search for new markets is reaching into every corner of the free world . Besides the vigorous export-building efforts in West Germany and other European nations , trade specialists are active in such out-of-the-way spots as Salisbury , Southern Rhodesia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other achievements . U.S. trade promoters in Malaya have aided one American firm to win orders for 40 tractors and another to sell two airplanes . Promotion Outlays Rise - The U.S. export drive is largely the responsibility of the Commerce Department , though many State Department employes assigned to American embassies and consulates work on trade matters . The Agriculture Department is also involved in export promotion . through its efforts to increase sales of U.S. farm products overseas . Reflecting the Administration 's emphasis on expanding exports . the Commerce Department is asking Congress for $11.5 million for trade promotion activities in the year starting July 1 ? more than double the current fbical year 's promotional budget of $4.9 million . The Government 's concern over exports stems mainly from its determination to improve the U.S. position in the flow of international payments . Last year American exports totaled $20.1 billion , topping imports by $6.7 billion . But this was not sufficient to offset the flow of U.S. funds abroad for military expenses , foreign aid and investment . The result was a $2.4 billion balance-of-payments deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration has said , by a 10 , , - ; increase in U.S. exports . The efforts of U.S. trade officials abroad to uncover sales opportunities for American businessmen are a key part of the export program . But the program has other aspects . In a number of countries , the Commerce Department is establishing permanent " trade centers " where American manufacturers can display their goods . Such a center has been in operation in London since last June ; an exhibition of American-made commercial photographic equipment is now running . A trade center opened-in Bangkok , Thailand , only last week . with a show of light woodworking machinery as its initial attraction . Additional trade centers will open in Frankfurt and Tokyo late this year . Besides these permanent showcases for U.S. goods , the Commerce Department will sponsor 13 short-run commercial and industrial exhibits around the world in fiscal 1963 . Officials say these exhibits will differ from the propaganda-type displays the U.S. has concentrated on in the past as it sought to impress neutralists and Iron Curtain countries .

So the Government will be able to offer better guidance to American businessmen hoping to sell overseas , Commerce Department researchers working under Mr. Krason in Dusseldorf have been seeking the reasons some U.S. firms-have failed to land foreign orders . The researchers have found , among other things , that U.S. firms  --  and sometimes the Government  --  often do n't move swiftly enough . U.S. officials say a British government commercial officer who comes up with a prospective sale can obtain a response from an English firm within a week through the British Board of Trade in London . American companies rarely match this speed . Furthermore , studies made In Dusseldorf suggest , American firms often do n't take the trouble to accomodate themselces to the special requirements of the export market .

In some major categories of products , such as steel and autos . American companies obviously can not meet foreign prices But a study of export opportunities turned up by Commerce Department representatives in Dusseldorf over the course of a year showed that in only 7r , of the cases were U.S prices too high to be competitive . U.S. officials in Europe say few American businessmen realize the potential of the export field .
