txt French President de Gaulle is packing his bags for a June mission to Moscow . Paris is insisting " nothing sensational " will happen . So East Europe is expecting something merely significant . Since early spring , Communist East European nations have been expecting at least that . They have conducted almost nonstop consultations all spring long . And in July they will cap it all with a Communist summit attended by all Soviet and East European party and state leaders . These meetings have been , in part , to look hard at hopes for " early " Communist initiatives in international affairs  --  especially in Europe . And General de Gaulle is a linchpin to these hopes . East Europeans view his defiance of NATO as a " positive trend . " They think his talks in Moscow could well lead to a first concrete move toward an East-West all-European meeting , which some East European states eagerly seek . Noises are drifting out from backstage at NATO that the scene is being set for a withdrawal of some American troops from Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might help everybody . The United States would pick up some extra muscle for its Vietnam effort . Besides , Bonn finds it hard to meet American troop costs in West Germany . So a partial withdrawal would help the German pocketbook , too . However , two problems still intercede . Moscow must be induced to withdraw some of its 20 divisions from East Germany . And enough American troops must stay in West Germany to provide a trip wire against any Soviet attack . Moscow has been complaining to third parties about the high cost of keeping 350. - 000 troops in East Germany . And labor shortages at home are also pinching the Soviets . Spain may reach for outside leverage to help pry the Rock of Gibraltar from British hands . The conviction is running high in Gibraltar itself that Madrid may put pressure particularly on the United States to back Spanish claims to the Rock . Currently Spain is in direct talks with Britain over Gibraltar . Madrid 's chief outside lever might be American bases and space-tracking stations on Spanish soil . Gibraltar recalls that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed , the United States closed its consulate in Gibraltar . Ostensibly it was to save money , but Gibraltarians lay it to Spanish pressure . Ships of the American Export Lines later stopped calling at Gibraltar , tying up instead across the way in Algeciras . If all this does point to future Spanish pressure  --  which is by no means proven  --  renewal of Spanish-American military agreements in 1968 may be at stake . Elections next month in the West German state of North Rhine-Westphalia will reverberate nationally  --  perhaps internationally . The state now is governed by a coalition between West German Chancellor Ludwig Erhard 's Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) and the Free Democrats ( FDP ) . Together they hold a slim edge over the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) . In 1962 , the CDU polled 46 percent of the vote , the FDP 7 percent , and the SPD 43 percent . But this time , if on-the-spot reports hold up , the SPD will increase its vote , the CDU will lose ground , and the FDP at best will stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will take over the state government . If it wins only a plurality , it may force a " grand coalition " with the CDU . Either way the CDU 's national prestige will suffer . It might even move the anti-Erhard faction in the party to demand a change of chancellors . Trends ... European criticism of Washington and London monetary policies has hit a high pitch . The noted French economist , Jacques Rueff slammed both nations in a recent speech . And Bonn , Brussels , and The Hague all nodded assent . Mr. Rueff attacked the way in which he said Washington and London " manipulate " the International Monetary Fund . He insisted they pursued only one objective  --  to obtain the foreign currencies which they needed for their own ends . He demanded that the two nations put their financial houses in erder ; close the gap in their balance of payments ; stop running up a constant deficit in their international accounts ; and stop using funds obtained from solvent members of the fund to build up their own investments and real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
