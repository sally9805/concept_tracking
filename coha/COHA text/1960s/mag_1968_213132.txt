Director Jean-Luc Godard often seems like a sprinter who keeps trying to run the mile - and fails . This time he goes the distance : Les Carabiniers is quite possibly Godard 's finest film since his first , the artful Breathless of 1959 . <P> Les Carabiniers - made in 1963 but just released in the U.S. - opens with a quote from Jorge Luis Borges , the Ar gentine poet and novelist , claiming that " worn metaphors " come closest to truth . <P> No one can grind a metaphor to dust faster than Godard , and in this pacifist fable , he grinds out dozens of familiar antiwar gambits . But this time the man ner enhances the material , and man ages to prove Borges ' maxim correct . <P> On a desolate farm in an unnamed country live two brothers . In Godard 's typical allusive way , they are named Ulysses and Michelangelo . Illiterate and indigent , the men ( Albert Juross and Marino Mase ) listen slack-jawed as two soldiers ( carabiniers ) try to entice them into fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loot and license the recruits will enjoy : cattle , Maseratis , naked girls , the opportunity to break children 's arms and inform on innocents . At last they are persuaded , and go off to conquer the world . It is not long , of course , before the world conquers them . Against photographer Raoul Coutard 's haunted landscapes - interrupted by newsreel footage of atrocities and death - they loot and plunder , lifting skirts and wallets , but growing steadily poorer . <P> Eventually , Godard brings the recruits home and shows that to the spoiled belongs the victory . Ulysses and Michelangelo , now maimed and babbling , carry with them a trunkful of treasure . The loot is a lampoon of Western culture : hundreds of picture postcards that juxtapose Ava Gardner 's face and an Ingres nude , Volkswagen factories and the pyramids . In the end , the soldiers are themselves consumed by the anarchic " peace " that follows victory in which sound trucks thread the littered streets blaring , " Our enemies are democrats , Marxists , Jews . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighed the production down . But they have been lightened with lean , clean performances and shot with Godard 's customary breakneck style . Les Carabiniers does indeed rest upon a worn metaphor : in a war , winner takes nothing . If the old saw works this time , it is because Godard has placed it in the context of something as timeless as a folk tale .
