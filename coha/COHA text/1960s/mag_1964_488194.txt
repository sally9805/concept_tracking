A showdown could be approaching at the United Nations . When the Nineteenth General Assembly opens on November 10 , the Soviet Union may not be permitted to vote . Under Article 19 . of the UN Charter , member states delinquent in their assessed contributions for two years or more lose their vote in the General Assembly unless that body specifically waives the penalty . The United States is determined to enforce this sanction against the Soviet Union if the latter continues to withhold payment of assessments for the UN peace keeping operations in October 26 , 1964 the Middle East and in the Congo . On the other hand , Premier Khrushchev told UN Secretary-General U Thant in Moscow that if the Soviet Union is deprived of its voting rights , it will leave the ' United Nations . In view of this imminent crisis , the UN 's financial predicament warrants a close look Whenever the United Nations has engaged in major peacemaking responsibilities , there has never been a lack of Cassandra 's to predict that the organization would end with a military bang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Congo , a real possibility arose that it might end with a bookkeeping whimper The fiscal squeeze that developed in the early 1960s became a threat to the very life of the organization .

The normal day-to-day expenses of the organization amount to a little more than $80 million ' a year , and the specialized agencies spend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Children 's Fund are no drain on UN resources because they subsist solely on government and private voluntary contributions ; the total thus raised is approximately $200 lion a year for five programs Finally , there are the peace force budgets : UNOC , which for the first three years cost about $120 million a year , and UNEF which costs approximately $20 million a year . Many ' governments ' have balked at payments for these peace-keeping operations , and as a result , ' by late 1964 ; the United Nations was more than $140 million in debt for them . Never have so many people argued so much about so little money . The reason is that the financial problem of the peace-keeping operations is primarily a political problem . The argument centers , not'on the money itself , but on the role that the UN can properly play in the national policies of its member states . When the General Assembly authorized the establishment of UNEF in 1956 , Dag Hammarskjbld urged that a special account be set up to finance the force as a collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members supported the Secretary-General , but the Soviet bloc asserted that the " aggressors " ? i.e. , Great Britain , France and Israel  --  should pay . Between these ' two apposing views , a third emerged : many of the new nations claimed that everyone should pay something , but that the great powers , which had special privileges under the Charter , should also accept special responsibilities and pick . up the major portion of the cost . This " rebate formula " won the day : the bill for UNEF was assessed upon the entire membership , but the underdeveloped nations were given rebates of 50 per cent and the 264 wealthier nations were invited to make up the deficits through voluntary contributions . During the next few years . however , shortages gradually ' developed . The Soviet Union , which opposed the force on ' political grounds , declined to pay its share . And many of the smaller nations , though they approved of the Middle East force , claimed that they were unable to pay even their reduced assessments . By 1960 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major worry The problem of paying the $120 million UNOC budget brought the United Nations to the brink of bankruptcy . The Secretary-General once again supported the principle of collective responsibility , but this time the Western nations broke ranks , France joining the Soviet Union in political opposition . The majority of the membership agreed to another rebate ' formula , but this time the reductions ' granted the poorer states reached 80 per cent . Deficits now began to mount sharply Two permanent members were unwilling to pay , and more than half the membership claimed incapacity to pay By late 1961 , the UN debt approached $900 million and the General Assembly was forced to take emergency action . First , it authorized a $200 million bond issue and invited governments to subscribe , hoping to tide the peace forces over until a more satisfactory solution could be found ; second , it requested the World Court to issue an advisory opinion on the legal status of the peace force assessments The response to the bond issue was fairly generous . Sixty governments purchased approximately threefourths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total . This made it possible to meet the , costs of the two forces until early 1963 ' without having to assess ' the membership during that period . And in July of 1962 , the World Court declared that the assessments for UNEF and IJNOC were the responsibility of the entire membership . The court opinion , however , did not persuade the Soviet Union and France to clear their accounts , though it did elicit payments from numerous smaller nations to a total . of more than $6 million . The bond money was exhausted in May of 1963 , and the General Assembly had to meet in emergency session . It appropriated $42.5 million for the two peace forces for the last six months of 1963 and granted a 55 per cent reduction to the developing countries In December , it appropriated $17 75 million for UNEF for 1964 , but decided to allot only $15 million to carry UNOC until the end of June , 1964 . The majority of the members were in no mood to continue massive peacekeeping operations indefinitely . The combined cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one-fourth of those appropriated for 1963 . In keeping with its increasingly conservative mood , ' the General Assembly gradually retreated from the principle of collective responsibility for the funding of . peace keeping operations . Thus , in 1962 , the costs - of the UN Temporary Executive Authority in West New Guinea ( UNTEA ) were divided evenly between the two direct beneficiaries , the Netherlands and Indonesia ; similarly , in 1963 the expenses of a UN observer group sent to Yemen were split between Egypt and Saudi Arabia In mid-1964 , the last UNOC troops left the Congo , and the costs of the new UN Peace Force dispatched to Cyprus had to be raised through voluntary contributions every three months . In September , 1964 , Secretary-General U Thant had a hard time raising even the meager sum of $7 million needed to keep the 6,400-man UN force in Cyprus for another three-month period As he put it : " If.the UN does not settle its past , it may not have much of a future . " The financial crisis of the United Nations has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the , unmistakable symptom of an early death of the organization They point to the history of the League of Nations and maintain The NATION that , in its case , financial ' atrophy was the first symptom , of doom , On closer scrutiny , this comparison does not hold up Many of the omens are similar , to be sure , but the causes are quite different . The fiscal plight of the League arose from a doubt about its very existence . Many states questioned the justification for the League , others tolerated it ; certainly no state wanted it to move beyond the concept of a " static conference machinery . " In that sense , the League 's ' chronic financial anemia had been the result of a struggle between nihilists and conservatives : those who would deny its existence altogether and those who would relegate it to the peripheries of their national policies . The former attitude led to active hostility , the latter to political neglect and indifference . The UN 's financial plight does not reflect a struggle over the organization 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have accepted its presence , and the debate has moved onto a higher plane . It is now being waged between the conservatives and the liberals : those who wish to maintain the UN as a " static conference machinery , " and ' those who wish to endow it with increasing strength and executive authority . But when one examines the attitude ' of the superpowers in detail , it becomes clear that the " liberal " and " conservative " labels must be used with caution in the areas of peace-keeping and financing . It is true that the United States has generally favored the creation of peacekeeping machinery as a collective responsibility , of the membership , while the USSR has tended to reject the assessment principle for UN peace forces . But the Soviet Union has not always said " no " with equal vigor . In fact , until 1963 the Soviet Union paid for a considerable number of minor peace-keeping operations that were financed through the regular budget . It acquiesced in ? the establishment of UNEF and actually voted for the creation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence , the Soviet attitude can be seen as a spectrum ranging from acquiescence through passive resistance to active , obstruction . Moreover , these positions often change , the Russian attitude toward the Congo operation being a case in point . Similarly , those states that generally favor UN peace-keeping operations , do not always say " yes " with the same degree of enthusiasm . Some states , among them the United States , support the political resolutions authorizing establishment of the peace forces , then vote for the financing resolutions , and make payment in due course . Others have second thoughts at the second stage and abstain or even vote against the financing resolutions . And some that vote " yes " in the first two stages refuse to pay when the bill is presented . The-liberal position on peace-keeping forces can ' be plotted on a broad scale : enthusiastic support , moral support and tacit consent . The more ' cautious faun of liberalism and the permissive form of conservatism often meet  --  in voting , if not in principle  --  on the common ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases on grounds of national interest , rather than abstract principle . This is particularly true of the sUperpowers . From the United States ' point of view , UNEF and UNOC protected two no man 's lands of the cold war from possible East-West military confrontation and , at the same time , reduced the likelihood of unilateral Russian intervention . The Soviet Union , on the contrary , saw UNEF and UNOC as preventing Soviet bridgeheads in the Middle East and Africa . Since , in the case of the Congo , a bridgehead ' already established ' had to be removed under UN pressure , Soviet opposition to UNOC took the more active " form . Russia did not oppose UNEF and UNOC because it did not want to pay for them ; it did not want to pay for them because it opposed them . No one knows how the United States would react to a UN peacekeeping operation that conflicted with its national interests , because to date the United States has never been on the wrong side of a UN police action . In part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been killed in the Congo instead of Lumumba , the UNOC operation might have provided ' an interesting test of United States commitment to the principle of , collective responsibility in the financing of peacekeeping ' operations . The - American voting supremacy in the UN has 265 also been important in preventing issues like the 1954 coup in Guatemala from being considered at any length by the UN . But although one should not guess how the United States would act toward a UN peace-keeping operation of which it disapproved , it : has not hesitated to attack UN operations it deemed contrary to its national interest in the far less sensitive economic and social areas of UN operations . The point here is not to indict the policies of one superpower or to praise the actions of another , but to ? suggest that in peace-keeping matters it is misleading to associate the United States or the Soviet Union too closely with ? any one abstract position . EaCh case is decided according to the national interest . While the positions of the superpowers have had little to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller powers the sums involved ' are relatively large and have played a far more 1m-portant and , in some instances , even a , decisive role . It is a fact , for example , that in terms of percentages of their gross national products twenty-one nations are called upon to make larger contributions to total UN costs than is the United States . Hence , while the financial crisis of UNEF and UNOC is caused primarily by the political conservatism of the few , it is intensified by the financial limitations of the many . The toughest problem , therefore , is still that of coming to grips with politically motivated deficits . One way to meet the challenge completely would be to construct a scale which permitted a member to refuse payment for a peace-keeping operation which it opposed . That solution would ignore the World Court advisory opinion that all member states should pay , but it would acknowledge the reality that no power , certainly no great power , can be coerced into paying . It isalso important to make a distinction between passive and active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Soviet Union 's opposition to UNEF , supporters of the force may wish to ignore it and pay the share of the recalcitrant power . But if they override active opposition , they risk driving the obstructionist power out of the UN altogether . The unavoidable truth that emerges is that the launching of an operation in the face Hof either passive or active opposition is to ask for financial crisis , and that any state which asks for such a crisis may have to be prepared to bail the organization out . A central fact of international life is that no power , least of all a superpower , will adopt or pay for a policy which it ' considers inimical to its own interest . Statesmen on both sides of the iron curtain should ponder this truth before pushing this fall 's scheduled crisis beyond the point of no return .
