If there is one part of U.S. business that is vibrantly healthy , it is the auto market . Sales are galloping 30% ahead of last year , production is up 50% . The country clubs of Bloomfield Hills echo with bullish snorts about a 6.6 million car year , including imports , best since 1955 's fabled 7.1 million . This is important to the whole economy because autos mean steel , rubber , glass , zinc , aluminum and textiles , and also because of the popular belief that if autos roll well not too much can be wrong with business in general . Now the spring selling season begins , and it will determine whether automen will have a good year - or a great one . <P> The Golden Boys . So far the 1962 auto boom is big but bumpy . Not in years has General Motors been so strong or Chrysler so weak . <P> G.M. has an embarrassment of riches . With Frederic Donner , a tack-sharp onetime accountant , as chairman , G.M. now commands 55.7% of the U.S.-made auto market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry since Henry Ford 's model Ts got 60% in 1921 , and more than enough to prompt some nervous glances from G.M. officials toward the U.S. Justice Department , whose antitrust division constantly eyes the affairs of the world 's biggest manufacturer . This year G.M. has conspicuously dropped its usual practice of stepping up Chevrolet advertising as its sales increase . There have been no recent dealer incentive contests for fast-selling Pontiac . Oldsmobile or Buick . <P> Two of G.M. 's golden boys are Edward N. Cole , 52 , and Semon ( " Bunky " ) Knudsen , 49 . Cole ( TIME cover . Oct. 5 , 1959 ) , who piloted Chevy and fathered the fast-selling Corvair and Chevy II before recently becoming group vice president for all car and truck divisions , can take much credit for the fact that Chevy alone has captured 33% of the market . Vice President Knudsen , who was Pontiac boss before he succeeded Cole as Chevy chief , was the man who souped up the Pontiac styling and is now seeing the new Chevy II compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the smaller , sporty Corvair . Pontiac rides in third place in sales across the nation ( behind Ford 's Ford division ) , Oldsmobile has risen to fourth ( from fifth last year ) and Buick to fifth ( all the way up from eighth ) . <P> Why is G.M. so hot this year ? Says a vice president of a competing automaker : " Every time there is a surge in sales , G.M. increases its penetration . It 's simply a case of the guy who has the most stores getting most of the new business . " G.M. has almost 14,000 dealerships , Ford 8,000 , Chrysler not quite 6,000 , American Motors 3,000 , Studebaker little more than 2,000 . There is , of course , more to it than that . G.M. has improved its styling ( notably on Buick and Oldsmobile ) , does not have a single dog in its garage . " We thrive on competition , " said Ed Cole in a speech last week that seemed to be aimed at reassuring Bobby Kennedy and his trust busters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands of the American public . " <P> Not all companies are thriving on the competition from G.M.
