Two of the oldest advertising campaigns in the $14 billion liquor industry have lately taken a new direction . For 32 years , Hiram Walker &; Sons ' Canadian Club " adventure series " has shown men trying far-out sports in faraway places , giving up finally to enjoy their favorite highball . Last month for the first time , the adventure included a woman mountain climber , who paused halfway up a rock face to ask : " Do I really have to do this sort of thing to earn my Canadian Club ? " Meanwhile , Seagram Distillers Co. , whose moderation ads since 1933 have cautioned fathers and counseled sons on drinking , switched pictures to a teenage daughter . " But , Daddy , " she pleaded , " if I do n't drink , they 'll think I 'm from nowhere . " To which Seagram answered : " Drinking is a pleasure reserved for adults . She can wait . " <P> Their Pleasure . The two ads are effects of the same trend : the pleasure reserved for adults is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's . Of some 65 million U.S. women over 18 , probably six out of ten , by the inexact statistics of the liquor industry , drink at least occasionally . That represents a one-third increase in women drinkers in only ten years . Moreover , women now make about 45% of all liquor purchases , usually for the family . To win over to particular brands this rising number of sippers and shoppers , the industry is doing everything from putting out primers on cordials ( National Distillers Products Co. ) to promoting fashion shows in which the clothes carry I. W. Harper Kentucky Bourbon labels ( Schenley Industries Inc . ) . Currently , $25 million worth of holiday wrapping is being tucked around package goods to give it a glossy , eye-catching sheen for the Christmas trade , which accounts for 15% of all sales . The color combinations of blue , green and lavender and the expensive embossed paper and fabric wrappings are mainly meant to attract feminine eyes . <P> Until 1958 , under the code of the Distilled Spirits Institute , the industry trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the code was eased , Heublein , Inc. , pioneered with a bottled-martini ad that included two cocktails on a table , a smiling young matron , and the phrase : " A wife 's warmest welcome is well chilled . " At first , like the Heublein lady , women could not be shown touching a glass or a bottle . Canadian Club 's new approach indicates that women can share both the adventure and the whisky . The most recent Seagram gin ad shows a married couple holding martinis and bragging about " our secret " for making them well . Distillers try to keep the women wifely instead of sex-kittenish . " The girl , " says Seagram Distillers Co . President Bernard Tabbat , " has to be a nice girl . " Adds National Distillers Vice President-General Manager Raymond Herrmann : " We do n't shock with low-cut gowns , but we do n't use nuns either . " In rather startling exception to this cautious approach , Cluny Scotch shows an obviously thirsting elderly woman pouring her Cluny into a teacup.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
