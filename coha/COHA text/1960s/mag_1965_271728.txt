Most Wagnerian productions are mounted either in Cecil B. DeMille rococo or , in recent years , Bayreuth Freudian . Last week , for a change , Munich 's National Theater opened a new Tristan und Isolde that dispensed almost entirely with theatrical effects , set the most important scenes in near-darkness . Explained Director Rudolf Hartmann : " I wanted this to be a Tristan in which the main interpretation was left to the music . " His concern , which would have delighted Richard Wagner , suited the occasion : the 100th anniversary of Tristan 's premire-also in Munich . <P> The opera 's first production was almost as heavy with intrigue as Wagner 's plot . Though the composer grandly pronounced Tristan " the greatest musical drama of all time , " opera houses in Dresden , Berlin , Vienna and Munich rejected it as " unperformable . " Moreover , to a public reared on Rossini , Bellini , Donizetti and Meyerbeer , most of Wagner 's works seemed to be joyless monstrosities . <P> Doting Benefactor . Wagner had other troubles .

His deliverance came in 1864-seven years after he had started work on Tristan-when Ludwig II was crowned king of Bavaria . An effeminate , blue-eyed , ethereally handsome lad who was Wagner 's most ardent admirer , Ludwig , then 18 , dispatched an emissary to track down his idol , finally discovered the composer holed up in an attic room of a hotel in Stuttgart . <P> Wagner was presented with the king 's priceless signet ring and a promise of a lavish premire of Tristan in Munich . In addition , the king promised Wagner all the money he needed , a new theater , a new music school and a new home . Ludwig also bombarded the 51-year-old composer with tender letters vowing eternal devotion . Wagner , a short , haggard-faced man , was careful not to alienate his doting benefactor , but he had other irons in the fire .

Oh , how complete . " Then , suddenly Wagner 's affair with Cosima was exposed . In a jealous rage , Ludwig banished the composer from the capital . <P> A few months later , war broke out between Bavaria and Prussia , and Ludwig 's untrained , ill-equipped army was crushed . Had Ludwig spent as much money for artillery as he lavished on Tristan , it is conceivable that European history might have turned out differently .
