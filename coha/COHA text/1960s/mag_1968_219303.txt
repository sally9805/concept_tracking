Light from a single , well-defined source holds such a strong attraction for night-flying moths that a flickering candle flame can lure them to a fiery death . But when light comes from all angles , as in a brightly lit room or outdoors during daylight , some moths cease all activity , as if they had been " turned off . " Scientists have long wondered : What throws the switch ? <P> <P> In the current issue of Applied Optics , Entomologist Philip Callahan , of the Department of Agriculture , reports on delicate experiments with which he answered the question . Callahan caught some giant cecropia moths , which live in the woods , studied them under a binocular microscope and decided that it was tiny spikes at the base of their delicate , fernlike antennae that reacted to strong light . To check his theory , he blacked out the moths ' eyes , painted each antenna black , except for the tips of the spikes , and ran minuscule wires into the main antennal nerves . Then he began subjecting them to light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the case , the spikes proved to be precisely tuned receivers highly sensitive to the wave lengths of visible light . At the base of the spikes , tiny sensors transformed the light into nerve impulses that sent electrical signals to the brain . Under strong light , those impulses automatically blanked out the sense of smell and responses to temperature and humidity on which a moth relies as it flies around in search of a mate or a place to lay eggs . <P> The moth 's spikes , a scant 26 ten-thousandths of an inch long , provide it with an automatic lifesaving device . Without them , says Callahan , the slow and conspicuous insects would probably take wing during daylight . And if they did so , they would make themselves easy prey for birds .
