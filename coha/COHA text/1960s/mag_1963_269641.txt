To take the temperature of the U.S. economy and to gauge at the same time the mood of the men who are most important in making it run , TIME this week called on every one of its U.S. bureaus . Correspondents from New York to Los Angeles and from Detroit to Houston interviewed some 200 businessmen , economists and public officials up to and including the President of the United States . Out of the 400 pages of copy that the correspondents sent to New York , plus a mass of other research and reports , Senior Editor Edward L. Jamieson , Writer Marshall Loeb and Researcher Piri Halasz reached the consensus reported in the cover story on the new and exuberant U.S. economy . The new mood of confidence and optimism offers a striking contrast to the temper reported exactly one year ago this week in our June 1 , 1962 issue when the cover featured Bear v. Bull on Wall Street , and the story accurately charted the unhappy market trend that became the year 's most dramatic business news . <P> It was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new economy , so we chose twelve key executives in dynamic companies that range all across the broad sweep of U.S. business and industry . The choices were pointed but not necessarily exclusive-a good many of the colleagues and competitors of these twelve might have been included . The twelve we chose : <P> Monroe Jackson Rathbone , president , Standard Oil Co . ( New Jersey ) <P> Joseph L. Block , chairman . Inland Steel Co . <P> Michael W. McCarthy , chairman , Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Smith <P> Mark Cresap , president , Westinghouse Electric Corp . <P> Rudolph A. Peterson , vice chairman , Bank of America <P> Gilbert Fitzhugh , president , Metropolitan Life Insurance Co . <P> William Allan Patterson , president . United Air Lines <P> John F. Gordon , president . General Motors Corp . <P> Charles Thornton , chairman , Litton Industries , Inc . <P> Lammot du Pont Copeland , president , E.I. du Pont de Nemours &; Co . <P> Courtlandt Gross , chairman , Lock heed Aircraft Corp . <P> Ralph Lazarus , president . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a special challenge to the growing number of readers who collect the autographs of cover subjects : they will have to use a series of mailings to get twelve signatures on one copy of the cover . The process may go on for years . How long it goes on in much less involved circumstances was noted last week by Theologian Karl Earth as he was being interviewed for this week 's story in Religion . Ever since he appeared on the cover ( April 20 , 1962 ) , said Earth , he has been receiving " a never-ending flow of envelopes from America , containing my TIME cover picture , with requests to return it , duly signed . The only way I can find to sign it is by writing Karl on the left side , and Earth on the right side of my collar . This is the only white on the picture , and the signature makes me look like a Salvation Army officer . I guess that cover really made me famous , like Jack Dempsey. "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
