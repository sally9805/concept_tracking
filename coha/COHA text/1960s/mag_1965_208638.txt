What 's New Pussycat ? is a comedy built on so many shaky assumptions that it ought to sue for nonsupport . It seems logical to anticipate fun aplenty when a cordon of first-rate talents gather to make the fur fly , but on this mournful occasion all hands appear joined in a conspiracy to leave Pussycat out in the rain . <P> <P> Peter O'Toole deserves the faintest applause for his fussy posturing as a Parisian fashion editor . He is supposedly irresistible to women , and they to him . So he delays marrying a determined fralein ( Romy Schneider ) , consults a sex-crazed Viennese analyst ( Peter Sellers ) , and calls forth memories of his sexual prowess , filmed appropriately in dull blue-grey hues . When O'Toole is n't reminiscing , he is bedding or about to bed Romy , a Crazy Horse stripper ( Paula Prentiss ) , a groundling nymphomaniac ( Capucine ) or a nymphomaniac who descends by parachute ( Ursula Andress ) . Sellers dresses up his cliche role with a pageboy wig and temper tantrums and is funnier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their own amusement . <P> In his disappointing double debut as a scenarist and second banana , Nightclub Comedian Woody Allen has written a small flat role for himself and fleshed it out with perhaps a dozen workable gags . The rest of the dialogue is doggedly juvenile , so Director Clive Donner whips it into a frenzy , rummaging eclectically through a whole range of comedy styles , like a man tying tin cans to the tale of an old torn .
