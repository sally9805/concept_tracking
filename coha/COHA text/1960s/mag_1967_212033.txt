Tucked beneath the bluffs along the Mississippi on its Illinois shore , East St. Louis ( pop . 80,000 ) is a squalid reach of crumbling brick buildings , battered frame shacks and sleazy taverns , redeemed only by a view of St. Louis ' soaring Gateway Arch across the river . Poverty workers estimate that an appalling 65% of East St. Louis ' housing is substandard ; a full 21% of the work force is unemployed ; nearly a third of the city 's families-55%-60% of them Negroes-are on some form of relief . Fine kindling for riot , and last week Firebrand H. Rap Brown applied the match . <P> <P> Perched on the hood of a police car and surrounded by ten club-swinging bodyguards , the bouffant-haired Black Power fanatic harangued a crowd of more than 1,000 with his customary oxymoronic oratory , advising his listeners that the U.S. has 13 concentration camps where it plans to put Negroes and that " America gave us a black astronaut just so 's they could lose that nigger in space . " Then came the familiar peroration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get a gun . " As the crowd broke up , a Negro girl skipped down the street happily chanting " We 're going to have a riot , we 're going to have a riot ! " <P> She was right . Shortly after Rap left town , a band of angry Negro youths - many of them from Impact House , a federally funded poverty agency-gathered beneath the neon sign of a liquor store and began aping Brown 's agitational frenzy . Soon rocks and bottles were smashing store and car windows ; a policeman was shot in the arm by a sniper ; another cop blasted a 19-year-old Negro car thief , killing him . Fire bombs popped , and guttering flames silhouetted the scurrying shapes of looters carrying liquor , meat , window fans , cosmetics , even a drugstore cash register . For three days the violence flared and sputtered . Final tolls : nearly 100 fires , 49 arrests , 13 injuries , one death and some $200,000 in property damage . <P> Having left Illinois for Virginia , Rap Brown wound up behind bars after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Alexandria Corporation Court that he should not be held as a fugitive pending extradition to Maryland , where he is charged with inciting the July 24 Cambridge riot . Denied bail , Rap was hustled off to Richmond 's escape-proof penitentiary , then to a nearby prison farm for what could be a month-long stay while the extradition battle is resolved . For light reading , he took along the little red book of Mao Tse-tung 's thoughts .
