TO BE AN ATHLETE A story by Eunice Luccock Coffman The new tenant 's luggage  --  one Sears under-thebed flat trunk , eight crates of books trussed in bailing wire , marked on every side in red Magic Marker with threats of reprisal if damage were done  --  had been dumped on the front porch by the trucker while Miss Everleave was away at the Glen Rock Invitational . She saw the boxes as she turned in her drive , but no sign of the new tenant . First things first , she unloaded the MG , covered it and put away her rackets . Now she contemplated the oversized crates and single , shabby trunk . It was none of her affair , but she did n't like to see them left out overnight with rain threatening . So before she went in to take her shower she unlocked the tenant 's apartment and one after another hauled his crates and trunk into the sitting room . When it began to rain , she felt vindicated . Miss Everleave locked her tenant 's front door and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then stood still a minute . She had just moved several hundredpounds of books , played two matches today  --  one this morning , one this afternoon , at which she had been eliminated  --  and driven home in sweater and whites directly , without stopping to bathe , change , or eat . She let herself acknowledge that she ached . Leaning against the tile , Miss Everleave crooked her leg and examined the blisters on the soles of her feet , touched the big one on her right heel . She scolded herself briefly : who plays on her heels gets blisters there . She studied her right hand , stretching it so the calluses stood out in yellow islands  --  no damage . She lifted her right arm to the cabinet mirror and saw what a red welt her bra had incised between her breast and armpit . She pressed it gently with her fingertips and out load said , " Ouch .

She turned to the shower , twisting the HOT handle . Miss Everleave stood for some time in the beating spray , again and again stooping  --  for she was tall  --  to pass her head through it , offering her shoulders to it , her neck and ribs and back . She methodically massaged her legs  --  white at the hip , cordovan the length of thigh and shank , abruptly white again at the ankle , and white , battered feet  --  digging in her fingers . She turned off the water and , stepping into the hall where it was cool , rubbed herself down . Now . Now we face it , she ordered . That she had lost the match this afternoon had been a failure not of legs hot of concentration , far more nettling .

Miss Ever-leave sat at her kitchen table wrapped in a robe and , reflecting , kneaded a handball , an exercise that over the years had made the dimensions of her right wrist three-quarters of an inch larger than her left . She took a steak from the freezer ; she would have to wait while it defrosted . There was nothing much to eat  --  she had not expected to be eliminated until the quarterfinals on Friday . She heard noise from the tenant 's apartment next door , someone stumbling over the crates . It had started , she decided , in the second set , the third game , when she had lost her serve for no good reason . She was staying in the backcourt to save her legs for the days ahead but playing carefully , stroking hard , placing well that was when it had fallen , this cut or curtain between directives and her muscles ' reply .

Miss Everleave went to the parallel bars and began to swing , slowly , for she knew her body was tired . But it had not behaved well today ; it had Eunice Luccock Corfman is married to a doctor and has four children .

After the isolation of the summer , she regretted having to share the house again with someone else 's noises . It was unavoidable . In any case , classes would start in another week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine months . She swung off the hare . The steak would be ready now . Eating her steak , Miss Everleave reviewed the third set stroke by stroke . Next door the new tenant made banging and unpacking sounds . She became aware her review was turning into wishful thinking " if only . . " ? she caught herself and clucked with contempt . She decided to spend the evening answering some letters . Though sometimes it seemed to her the letters took an unconscionable amount of time wasted at a desk , she would not have had it any other way . These letters written to or on behalf of former students were connections she prized . Her relation to these correspondents was not " family " at all ; the term made her bridle . If she had been male , her relation to them would have been obvious to anyone  --  they had in common that she had once been their coach . They were related to her by having once been athletes . To be an athlete among athletes was why , though overage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis circuit and , more indirectly , why she always answered these letters . To be an athlete was so clear a definition of herself that in twenty-seven years of teaching  --  she preferred to call it coaching  --  it had never occurred to her that for most people there is no such thing as a female athlete . There was a knock at her door : it would be the new tenant . She tried to recall : a new man for the ? history ? economics ? something like that  --  department , She hurried to the desk drawer and found the card : Ekstein . Hector Ekstein . She went to the door and opened it . She said , " Dr. Ekstein ? Come in . Get out of the rain . " Another disappointment in a day of them . He was fat , how fat l And quite ugly , though she did not mind ugliness . Thick glasses and small , ripe lips . A little chin that nestled in folds of flesh . pale skin liberally cooled , and a gross body below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelted pants strained at the fly . Miss Everleave turned politely away in confusion , afraid she might have without intending betrayed her distaste . But when he stepped into the light and spoke , the impression he made was entirely otherwise , she could n't say exactly why , since he certainly became no thinner . His voice was pleasant , very pleasant , what she would call chuckly . He seemed 88 TO BE AN ATHLETE to find the rain , the lack of furniture  --  he had understood the apartment would be furnished  --  the absence of bookshelves when all he had brought were his books , the crowded College Inn which could not give him a room for the night , from which he had just hiked through the storm , all a conspiracy put together for his amusement and hers . Behind the lenses his eyes shone at her , coaxed her to join the fun at his expense . She liked the shyness of his manner , though it threw her off stride that he seemed to use it in order to be outspoken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an hour and a half 's acquaintance with a candor and assurance that amazed her . The remarks flew from his curling lips ; his shoulders shrugged to deprecate them as they came ; all she had to do was listen . She did not know whether to laugh or take offense , but she was shrewd enough to recognize he was trying to be friendly . " I 'm Sam Johnson come to Scotland , " he confessed and when she did not catch the allusion , interpolated quickly , " Strong suspicions of Ohio all my life and never been west of the Hudson till last night . " He went too fast . " You mean the Hudson River ? " she asked How could he never have been west of the Hudson ? What was east of the Hudson ? Was he foreign ? He sounded American " There 's nothing east of the Hudson . is there ? " He seemed to think she had made a joke . He laughed happily . " Right , east of the Hudson is nothing . Offshore islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racked her brain . Islands off the coast ? She changed the subject . " You have no furniture . Where will you sleep tonight ? " " I do n't know ! " he said gaily . " In the bathtub ? " She gave him her sleeping bag and he thanked her effusively and had to be shown how it worked . Later , ready for bed , rubbing ointment on her welt , she heard him still moving around , cracking loose a tray of ice in his kitchen . He had left a warm feeling behind him . Miss Everleave liked and admired warm people ; she knew her height and posture and untalkativeness sometimes gave an impression of coolness , which she recognized as a defect . It came to her ; he must have meant Long Island . Or even Manhattan , for that matter . Of course ! She grinned . That would explain why he 'd never used a sleeping bag . She began to review the third set again , dozing off . But became aware Hector Ekstein was coming regularly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for water , the pipes thucking each time he turned the tap . She told her brain to stop listening and it did . She fell asleep . The cracking of another tray of ice waked her . She sat up and checked her clock . Two A.M. ! Why was he not asleep ? Why drinking ice water ? Had he had no dinner ? Chewing ice from having had no dinner ! Miss Everleave swung her long legs out of bed . She got out of bed and padded to the closet , threw on a robe , and crossed the porch to his front door . Hector opened it and stepped back , arms spread in welcome . " My God ! A droit du seignevra I do n't know about ? " He ushered her in . " I 'm game if you are . Have a drink ? " She drew her bathrobe closer and wondered what he meant . He held up what was left of a quart of whiskey . Yet he seemed completely sober , moving for his weight with agility between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hazed and stung her nose . Two full ashtrays and eight or nine open books were spread out around her sleeping bag , which he had not even unrolled . " I 'm sorry to intrude , Dr. Ekstein , but I wondered if you 'd had your dinner ? " Again , that shy smile . " How considerate . Yes , I ate at the Inn . Here . " He handed her whiskey , which she did not tell him she rarely touched . She watched him closely . " You 're not a drinker , are you ? " " Gracious , no . Not unless you are . I 'm sipping while I ? " she was surprised to see him blush and falter , " ? prepare my first lecture . " " It 's almost two-thirty in the morning ! " " 1 hope you do n't mind . I do appreciate the sleeping bag .

" She was shocked . Twenty and all that flab ! Quickly , she said , " That 's very good to have your Ph.D . at twenty . " And added , " Do n't you worry . Lectures are easy . " Again she watched him closely , for a sign of sneer . He would know , of course , her lectures were physical education . But he seemed genuinely thankful . She said , " You must get yourself some furniture in the morning . I 'll lend you my car if you like . " " That 's so good of you . " His whole face crinkled . She thought : what a merry type of person . He said , " But on my island many natives grow up without ever learning how to drive .

I rarely interfere with my tenants and vice versa. it 's better that way . Unless you need something . " By November Miss Everleave had learned she need not have reassured Dr. Ekstein about his lectures ; he had become a quick sensation on campus . Auditing Ekstein had become a Thing to Do . His coterie of student familiars was becoming the most select on campus . One of her Phys Ed majors told her he had scheduled private conferences with every one of his students about the reading they would do for their term paper from a reading list of hundreds of titles any of which he could talk about . He discarded the Economic History textbook and switched entirely to paperbacks ; the local bookstore had to set up a special corner to house them . He ate regularly in the student dorms and seemed to think it a delight instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juniors defected to became a History major . He had become Prominent . In what spare time she had , Miss Everleave spent the fall working on her lob topspin . Against her age , she undertook an extra conditioning program for the winter to keep her legs in shape : isometrics , ankle weights , a bicycle machine . And , of course , she continued kneading the handball . A matter that troubled her more than a little as fall turned cold was the incredible quantity of beer Dr. Ekstein consumed , leaving four or five cases of empties on the porch each Saturday to be picked up by DeFazio 's delivery boy . He had been truthful in saying he was not a liquor drinker  --  there had been no bottle in the garbage since the first one . And town beer , she had been told , was only 3.2 , scarcely more than a beverage . He must eat and drink nothing but 3.2 beer . She appreciated the price Dr. Ekstein was paying for his phenomenal popularity : each night he came home with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to those he already had of his own , lined up along every wall and around each scanty piece of furniture . She watched him trudge up the drive , merry , fat , burdened as Santa Claus with his bag , heard him while he read each night until all hours , regularly every half-hour or so noisily snapping the cap off a bottle in his kitchen next to her bedroom . But she was on good terms with him she believed , only once despite herself moved to suggest to him Diet-Pepsi instead of beer , for his weight 's sake . He had replied with his shy smile , thanking her , that he certainly ought to and so much would like to , but Diet-Pepsi put him to sleep  --  this when he had bags under his eyes the size and color ofolives . His cases of empties continued to appear on her porch each Saturday . He lost no weight and she continued to hear him in his kitchen late at night and early morning snapping his caps . During the day he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlady , confided even Science majors were switching schedules to take Econ Hist and that his three History II sections would be reassigned to the largest hall in Wentworth at the new semester . For the Christmas holidays Dr. Ekstein went home to his island , giving her a begonia for a present before he left , lugging it all the way from town . They said goodbyes with warmth ; she called him Hector , he called her Florence . But two days into the holiday she heard in the night sounds coming from his apartment . Investigating the next morning , she found no one there and nothing missing she could see . The next night , Christmas Eve , down in the basement on the parallel bars , she thought she heard sounds again . She went up and knocked at his door , but there was no answer . Christmas Day she drove to her old friend Coach Ben Kashimoto 's home , as she had for years , bringing presents for him , his wife , the children . As always , it was a jovial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midwest , she was Everleave , toasted in tomato juice , the best forehand east of Pasadena and north of Houston . She enjoyed Kashie 's heavy kindness , his wife 's interminable rituals of the holiday , seeing the four children one year older . Returning at dusk , she was surprised to see the lights on in Dr. Ekstein 's apartment . This time knocking and knocking again , she was answered by an undressed young man and just behind him , in black lace , one of her sophomores . " Oh , " exclaimed the surprised girl , " we thought you 'd be someone else . " The unperturbed young man answered her request for an explanation by saying Dr. Ekstein had given them his key for the holidays , and produced it . Miss Everleave took the key and told them they had three minutes to get out . They were not at all ashamed , seemed even angry . When Dr. Ekstein returned the evening of January first , she asked him for an explanation . He was mild . " What kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's charming . They 're two friends that wanted an apartment for the holidays . " She studied him , trying to figure his meaning . " I 'm not running a brothel , Dr. Ekstein. " " 1 should hope not , you 'd scare me into town if you were . " His chuckle coaxed her . She felt mocked . " What 's the problem ? " he asked . " Are they secretly married ? " He in turn seemed scandalized . " Certainly not . He 's only nineteen , after all . Give him a fighting chance . " Again she wondered what in his brilliance he could be talking about , She said in growing wonder , " Why , you 're not reliable , Dr. Ekstein . " He spread his hands . " But why , Florence , please , why ? " Her tongue was stiff . She could not tell him why when it was so unspeakably obvious . In her own house . All she said was , at last , " It must never happen again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his living beside her , as wholly given to his calling as she was to hers , satisfaction despite his empties on her porch and night noises that kept her awake , was gone . She saw that he continued overworking himself , single-minded as ever , as chaste as she and as uncaring , but always now there loomed for Miss Everleave the enormous , threatening unknown of great difference between them . with the new semester she began a gymnastics seminar she gave in alternate years , which she anticipated especially this year because she had three good athletes , one of them outstanding . Because gym facilities were crowded  --  coeducational folk dance and modern dance had recently been approved for a quarter credit , neither of them legitimate sports in Miss Everleave 's judgment , and the flatfooted were flocking to take advantage ? she decided to hold the seminar in her own basement . The three girls arrived on their bicycles at seven , warmed up for a half-hour with calisthenics , worked separately for an hour as she moved between them , holding a leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking infrequently and quietly , while the room warmed , silent except for their sighs and pants . They rested briefly and then together spent the final hour on the parallels , the best hour . She would demonstrate , they would repeat , again and again . There was hardly a word . When they had gone , Miss Everleave , drenched and extremely happy , would spend another hour writing up notes , working out regimens for each of them , blocking sequences for the next seminar while this one was still fresh in her mind . One snowy morning she offered Dr. Ekstein a ride to Wentworth for his eight o'clock , not because she distrusted him less but because he would otherwise get his feet wet . Since the holidays they had exchanged scarcely a word . He did not lookwell . The hours he kept , his pace , his diet , were showing on his face , but still he was no thinner . He was always fastidious in dress , but today she noticed his fingernails , raggedly bitten to the quick . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was taking a leaf from her book and moving one of his unofficial seminars , currently meeting at DeFazio 's which closed at eleven , out to his apartment , which need n't close at all . As she let him out at Wentworth , she saw even at 7:45 A.M. of this snowing cold morning a waiting circle of students moving forward to enclose him . Initially apprehensive , Miss Everleave was reassured when Dr. Ekstein 's seminar proved to be all male and noncarousing . Though they stayed late , they were not loud . All they seemed to do was talk , steadily , for hours . At first they came once a week , then two or three times a week , talking endlessly into the night and early morning . Wholesome enough , she decided , trying to put herself to sleep . Chapel speakers were elected by student ballot at the end of March , five of the faculty invited to give a paper on a subject of his ( or , theoretically , her , but that had never happened ) choice at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March , Instructor Hector Ekstein won in a remarkable landslide . No one before had ever won by such a landslide , least of all a first-year lecturer . Miss Everleave was both pleased and puzzled . Hector was likable enough and certainly worked too hard ; she had been told his lectures were dazzling ; she heard his quips quoted here and there . But why it should all erupt in this overwhelming vote she did not understand , nor the extraordinary jubilance it caused among the students . Over milk and graham crackers she questioned her seminar girls . One of them burst out , " It 's his charisma and his fantastic scholarship . He 's out of this world . He 's a showman , he 's intrepid , he 's got character , he 's engage , he loves us , he 's against locum parentis , it 's the concatenation . " Miss Everleave sighed . She wished people would speak simply . The girl added , " And he knows more about parallel-bar technique than I do . " Miss Ever-leave was startled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended in a standing ovation . The title of his talk was " Lonely Man on a Rock " and the gist of it seemed to be a plea for understanding toward those who chose or are condemned to spend their lives out on a lonely rock , alone in their singular perception , Miss Everleave felt her care touched . He seemed under the welter of words to be addressing her directly , to have singled her out for his topic . She was bewildered by the clapping and as fervent cries that followed his speech . Everyone else seemed to feel just as she did . How many lonely men on how many rocks could there be ? Nevertheless , that evening when he trudged up the drive , she crossed the porch to tell him , " That was a fine speech , a great speech . I wanted to thank you . " His eyes gleamed ; she knew in the dark he was blushing ; he made her feel she had crowned his day . Feeling as warm toward him as she ever had , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? One of my girls tells me you know more than she does . " His lips curled in their tentative way , his voice was chuckly as of old . " You keep a text in the back seat of the MG . I read it one clay you gave me a lift , while you stopped for a head of lettuce . " He grinned . " I do n't know more than she does . I 'd break my legs if I actually tried . " Mollified , Miss Everleave suggested , " You 've made quite an impression in your short time here . My students tell me you 're leading a Reformation . " She was not sorry to use the word . It hinted , since he knew parallel bars , she , also , knew history . He laughed , this time without his twinkle . " Oh , well . " Then in a rush , confessed with urgency , " Yes , like Luther . Faced with a peasants ' revolution and wanting to backtrack. / want the study , Flo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . Rut I wo n't he Luther , I ca n't , that constipated funk , I despise his bones . I 'll stick with the peasants . Though they do n't know anything . Anything at all . " Overpowered , lost , Miss Everleave wondered what to say . She had n't an idea what he meant . She knew he was telling her something important and she wanted to help . She should never have pretended to know about the Reformation . Now he was waiting for some kind of answer . He was used to people he could talk to and who talked back . Mortification brought her to her height , her chin lifted . " I 'm sorry , I don't. know anything about , it . " A step below , he looked up at her a moment and said , " You 're very handsome , you know that ? " Her words had been rebuffing , he was responding with tact . She nodded . It was not the first time she had been told . He was changing the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to help her . The failure was upsetting . It spoiled her good mood . She returned to her kitchen . Restless there , she went to the basement . She did swings and turns and leg crosses for a while , soon she was concentrating . What she desired of a sequence was that it should climb slowly to a strong finish ; she despised a fake build more than incompetence . The tory by Eunice Luccock Corfman 9 I series began to take a shape . She did a stand , two full turns , a pike , dive , save , final arm stand , brace , and swung to the mat . She would have to quit . It was seminar night and the girls would be coming soon . She went upstairs . Across the porch Hector 's seminar had already begun . Through the thin wall and open windows she heard their male voices already edged , argumentative before the argument . Always the roosters , she thought , smiling , scrubbing her arms and legs with a towel . They could n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " I 'm hastening all I can . It is n't here is what .

" " Up you , pardon me . Use your own . " Miss Everleave stripped off her clamp T-shirt and put on a fresh one . She sat on the edge of her bed and strapped on her ankle weights . " Go next door and borrow one . " " Heh . After you . " " Chicken . Always . " " Go ahead . Get us a bottle opener from next door . Your idea . Get for us a bottle opener from her .

" " Chicken , chicken . " Miss Everleave , flexing her weighted ankle , paused : why chicken ? Light voice , " I do not provoke , see ? " Deep voice , " Go , boy , gird your loins . Storm Lesbos , come back a man . " Miss Everleave closed her eyes and sucked air in slowly , waited  --  waited for Hector to come down hard on the deep voice . Light voice , " I wait for the girls . It 's safer . " Miss Everleave waited , breath held . Hector 's voice , chuckly , said , " Why safer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orgy . " Light and deep blended in laughter , rooster 92 TO BE AN ATHLETE crows . Miss Everleave 's lips loosened and the breath came out . Too little , too late , Hectur 's voice added , " Enough time wasted ? " Miss Everleave 's hand sought her pin tray , where she kept one of her handballs , found it , began to squeeze . But no footsteps came along the porch . And then because she was accustomed to disregard pain , she straightened , put the ball back in the pin tray , went to her desk to review her notes until the girls came . After the girls had gone she remained at the parallels , instead of coming upstairs to do her written work . But there was no assuagement in it . At last she gave up , showered and sitting at the kitchen table wrote a short note to Dr. Ekstein suggesting he seek other quarters . She left the note in his mailbox on her way to class and when she returned that evening he was waiting for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anxiety on his pale , olive-bagged , and mole-flecked face .

Even as she smothered her anger , fumbling for her key , she gloated at what it could have done to him . She walked to her door . From the steps he called after her , tentative but stubborn , " You 're one of the Counter-Refor-mation ? " She turned around to look at him , her key in the lock and the door half-open .

They had always been there , the contentions , the proposals , the battle lines . The girl was a talking encyclopedia of classified faculty infighting . " But now all this amorphous matter has been given bones , oh , Miss Everleave . Hector 's bones . " She flipped open her spiral notebook and fired , " Why have three Faculty Committees issued recommendations this year , why has the Administration promised a White Paper for June , why will there be an Alumni Magazine Special Issue at graduation , why is the Student Council revolutionizing house rules , why is the Reporter printing Manifestos , why , why , Miss Everleave ?

Each evening at seven at the Memorial Arch students were gathering to hear anyone speak about anything . At the same time , Ben also told her about the decision to rewrite the course curriculum of the Physical Education Department , a suggestion she had last made thirteen years ago . Miss Everleave by virtue of seniority was offered the chairmanship of the committee , but declined because the meetings would fall during the only hours the courts were free enough of students for her own practice . She found her legs had weathered the winter and her hours of work against the gym wall had given her lob topspin a jump it had never had before . Her net game was the next obstacle .

Some nights Hector spent shut away in a story by Eunice Luccock Corfman 93 his bedroom trying to keep up his reading or prepare his lectures , for she heard the voices calling out to him at midnight , to unlock his door . Other nights he took the floor and she heard , blurred by the walls , the lilt that launched the Reformation . In either ease , she had much less sleep , but said nothing .

How terrible he looked  --  even , at last , losing weight . In sleep the folds under his eyes , his cheeks , his jowls were sunken , unpleasantly colored , hanging loose ; it was his fastidiousness that had made him seem much healthier than he was . Asleep he had no such protection . Her consternation grew . He was sick ! This whole year long it had been happening ! Her hands wrung the towel and excess water dripped , splashing on the floor and waking him . He opened his eyes and saw her . sat up unsteadily , feeling his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then slumped , holding his head . " Are you all right ? " she asked . " What is the time of day ? " " About a quarter of eight . " His head jerked . " I 'll be late ! " He stood up , holding his pants . " Why do n't you be sick today ? You are . " " No , no . " He rubbed his scalp and scrubbed his cheeks . " Shower ! " He headed away and stopped , turning to her , hesitated . No. she noticed , he no longer unzipped so easily . " Uh . look . I know you do n't like me , but would you give me a lift to Wentworth ? " " All right . You 'll have to hurry . " In the car he leaned back and closed his eyes . His bulk cramped them , made the cabin small as a fitted sock , their laps and knees conspicuous . She backed down the drive . " You should have stayed home . I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He rubbed his eyes . " If T had stayed home , soup would not have been the problem . If I had missed my class by noon I would have had twenty bowls and twenty of them swarming out to feed me . " It struck her . The same tone as when he had said , oneis safe ; four might be an orgy . She perceived that it was his way . He could betray with a joke his students ' loyalty as easily as he had her . The pleasure of helping him out melted away . She regretted having felt pleasure . He was not aware of the change . " Anyway , this is good again . " He rested . At the red light he made an overture . " The old days were nicer , were n't they , Flo ' ? " She was glad to feel him waiting for an answer until it was clear she was not going to give him one . He looked down at his bitten nails . He rummaged in his pockets for his lecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen at once : two of the faculty reform reports came out , her own department 's curriculum revision , the administration 's white paper , the alumni magazine 's extra issue , the student newspaper 's Complete Manifesto for Change , Arch Seven 's 56 Intolerables written out on lavender toilet-paper streamers and flung over the Memorial Arch , all the activated matter Hector 's bones had pulled together and set dancing . Miss Everleave kept herself aloof as best she could , agreeing when she was spoken to , avoiding being spoken to when possible . She knew her tolerance for talk was low , but it seemed to her it had never been put to such a. strain . No one would be quiet , absolutely no one . Even Ben Kashimoto was full of opinion when she retreated to his home , even his turkey-baking wife , even his two daughters roller-skating in the hall . Everything alive wherever she looked was jittering to the dance . Miss Everleave refused to read the documents , she refused to sign anything , she refused to disagree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctuary . not her office , not the courts , least of all her own home around which the bicycles lay drunkenly everywhere . The students lounged along the porch and in the windows and on the grass , leaning at each other exchanging paragraphs . Even into her most private precinct , her basement gym , the three seminar girls arrived for their final exam and spent time heatedly whispering , until she sent them away with a rare show of temper . And just as she believed things could not possibly be worse , news of the nonrenewal of Hector Ekstein 's contract leaked . A departmental document , to be held secret until the campus was vacated for the summer , was stolen ; Xeroxed copies spread over the campus within two hours of the theft . She was handed one in the grocery store . As she brought her grocery bag into her kitchen she saw Hector 's seminar Regulars around his door , eyes bright with pain , one of them , whose deep voice she would never forget , openly crying . 94 TO BE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she unpacked her sack : black armbands , a bonfire , an effigy hanging of the History Department head , a funeral procession with coffin ? all rejected as puerile . Then : mass resignations and transfers , diploma burning , honors rejection . The cursing became obscene and Miss Everleave shut her window . Shortly , someone knocked . It was her junior student who had defected to History . " Please , Miss Everleave , I have to talk to you ? " " Sure . What about ? " The girl 's face was blotched . Her hand held a pen , papers . " We want faculty protest signatures . I 've got one fur simple protest and one for threat to resign , whichever you choose . " She laid them on the table . " I 'm sorry , I do n't sign things . " " Yes , I know . But this is different . We ca n't let this happen . We ca n't . " Her hands made fists , her elbows hugged her body . Miss Everleave 's sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad news . He 's been good for the college . " " He has ! Has he ever ! " The girl was radiant . " Which one do you want to sign ? " " Neither . " " But you just said . . . if you feel that way do n't you want ? " " No . " " It 's unjust ... We ca n't let ... We have to ... " Barely controlled , she paused . " I do n't ever sign , however I feel . " " But for him , your own neighbor , shafted in broad daylight . " The girl 's voice rose . " Even so . " Miss Everleave smiled slightly . The girl studied her , but Miss Everleave made no move to pick up the pen . The girl 's expression changed slowly , she uttered a long , extended guttural . " Ugggggh , " she breathed . " You . You . . noncombatant . " She swept up her petitions and left . But Hector declined to be martyred . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petitioners and curbed his Regulars . He was asked to prevent a History magna rum laude from a public repudiation of it and he did so . He was asked to speak at Arch Seven and did , to a hushed mob of students which blocked Miss Everleave in her MG , corning home after a net-practice workout . She watched the Ekstein magic at work as his squat figure paced and wheeled , pared and wheeled along the Arch dais telling them that to make an issue of one dismissed instructor was not nearly as important as getting on with the real options the year had opened . He did not deny he thought injustice had been done him , which comforted them ; they noisily approved . " But which do you want ? " he challenged them , " justice or solutions ? You ca n't have everything ! " ? which fell like a blasphemy , thrilling them to silence . The sum effect , after so many days of collective tension , was a growing approval of the wise young man who behaved and spoke so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Regulars and even they were wavering . Reforms had become possible . On the whole , one and all were grateful to Hector that they could have his bones and eat them , too . Miss Everleave observed that at last faculty , students , administration were turning faces in a slow pivot toward commencement . Without the threat of brutal confrontations all parties had much to gain . Much had been accomplished by the Reformation , much proposed , there was welcome room for positively oriented , temperate consolidation . A weighty consensus of hope , concluded the student Reporter in its final issue of the year . Miss Everleave read the editorial as she used the pages to wrap her dinner scraps for the pail . Late in the night Hector knocked at her kitchen door . He asked to come in . Much earlier she had heard him send away his Regulars so he could finish up his blue books and for several hours Miss Everleave had enjoyed a quiet she had not known for weeks . She had been on the bars , was drinking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track shorts , enjoying the slow , earned relaxation of her muscles and mind . The knock was an intrusion . " I 'm all done ! " he exclaimed , " Finished ! Phut ! " He spread his clumsy fingers . " You want to have a goodbye drink with me ? " It was the opposite of unzipping , a guarded dare ; the year had taught him something . She would have much preferred another time . Out of courtesy , one final one , she said , " Oh , well . Sit down . I 'll be back in a minute . " She had to shower in a hurry and skimp the rubdown . Incompletely dry , her skin resisted , twisted her underwear . Cheated of their slow massage , her thighs felt heavy , her calves lumpy . She pulled on a shirt and slacks and combed the kinks out of her hair . Be a sport , she ordered . He was waiting at the kitchen table with two drinks , hers pale , his dark amber . She fished the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chill . " To the soul 's ease , " he toasted and they both sipped . " It 's a shame you have to leave . I ca n't see you did a thing wrong to them . " " I ca n't either . " He tipped back his chair , awkwardly sporty . a story by Eunice Luccock Corfman 97 " They 'll do it every time , " she ventured , irritated at his smartiness but wishing him well enough . " Will they now . " From his precarious balance he looked directly at her . She saw her remark was tactless and also not very true . It made them stupid instead of wrong . It did n't do justice to the large injustice she could see he felt under the thin sportiness . " You had a raw deal here , " she amended , " a very raw deal . They should be ashamed . After you 've been gone awhile they will be . Do n't worry . " She shifted slightly because the elastic of her underwear was binding at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one pulite concession . " Christ ! " he choked . The chair legs banged on her linoleum , he hit her table with the flat of his palm . " Oh , Christ , a raw deal ! " His fingers curled over his mouth to shut it . For a terrible moment Miss Everleave thought he was going to weep . Her superbly trained body and brain reacted instantly ; gland discharge , tensed buttocks , nape pricks , sharpened vision . Warily , she watched his struggle , waited . He won . He shrugged and drank . " That 's the way the cookie bounces , " he said with the merest edge of bitterness . Relieved , Miss Everleave let her tension slack . She smiled and sipped , too . She wanted to find words to tell him she approved of him . " You 're okay , " she said . Then without warning , in a fury , he said , " And a raw deal from you , too . " Everything about his face was tight  --  shooting lips , pinched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once on the parallel in a split moment of slack attention her grip had slipped and the bar had caught her under the chin , jamming her sense . The bleakness of his voice had the impact of that blow . " Me ? I ? " she murmured . Even as her brain fought to recover it recognized his bleakness and how extreme it was . The bleakness was a toad he had let jump on the kitchen table between them . A toad with whose back markings her own life had made her familiar . She knew her toad . She could and had at other times examined it without fright or repulsion , in the small cage she allowed it . It was a double jamming that slowed her brain 's recovery : that someone else could have a toad like hers , that he could let it loose . Hector had flipped his on the table , not horny side up but all soft green tummy pulsing . She saw the moist , delicate membrane , unseen , unimagined until now . Miss Everleave was appalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She must dosomething : flip it back , pick it up and hold it gently and return it to Hector . She must do something for it , felt herself moving to a verge . But her head cleared a little and she perceived the toad was only an impression , not actually there on the table , and the verge receded . It had , so to say , jumped back into Hector . She must do something for him . Almost , she felt her arms lift to extend across the table and take his head between her hands . But her head cleared a little more and Hector 's white face and speckly moles came into focus and she perceived how inappropriate and embarrassing such an impulse would be for both of them , and the verge moved off again . But she must do something , anything , a gesture of comfort . Must , she pleaded to her brain , tried to think of various beginnings , raked to catch a snag of one , none came to mind . Raked , raked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ilelp , help me , she cried out to herself . All that occurred to her was to act in accordance with her manner of procedure on the bars : build a deliberate sequence leading to a strong but unhoked finish . She raised her glass and drank it all down , to make clear to Hector she entirely accepted his invitation to drink goodbye . She smiled to show that she considered all was well between them . She spoke . " I want you to know that your Chapel speech was the finest I have ever heard . I 'll remember it the rest of my life . " And lastly , she went to the drawer beside the sink and came back with a bottle opener . She gave it to him . " it 's a present . So in an emergency you 'll never be without one . " They shook hands and said goodbye . When Hector had left , Miss Everleave pulled the door to and leaned on it . She looked around her kitchen , once more hers alone . In a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . She bowed her head . Not by a mile had the manner of her procedure been up to what was needed . Steps taken in a sequence toward a verge gone out of sight . She went to the sink to close the drawer and picked up her handball to knead . Her fingers dented into it , her fingernails pierced its surface . Against a rising panic her fingers pressed , rolled it , pressed again . Why could n't 1 ? Why not up to it ? When the little thing had first jumped out and been capsized , that would have been the moment , even a moment later , time enough , even ... Miss Everleave sat down in the chair beside the kitchen table and clasped her hands together and squeezed the handball till her arm shook . And the seat where she sat was a high hard rock and every bit as cold .
