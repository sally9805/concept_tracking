With almost as much attentiveness as it gives to the comings and goings of its own planes , the U.S. Air Force has carefully logged every unidentified flying object that has been reported in the American skies during the past 22 years . During that time , Project Blue Book , as the operation was called , looked into a total of 12,618 UFO sightings . Yet lately , the flying-saucer business has fallen on hard times .
