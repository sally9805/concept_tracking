U.S. bankers are smiling at the customer these days , but they are giving each other a colder eye than ever . State-chartered banks are accusing the nationally chartered banks of attempting to move in on them . Both state and national banks are squabbling with the aggressive savings and loan associations , which have recently jacked their interest rates as high as 5% to tempt savers . Amid their competition for customers , all the banks are worried about growing Government regulation : the Justice Department is striving to block several bank mergers , and the House Banking Committee , after years of torpor , is striking out with half-a-dozen investigations into many phases of banking . <P> By far the sharpest battle in U.S. banking has been fired up by handsome James J. Saxon , 49 , who as Comptroller of the Currency supervises the 4,500 nationally chartered banks . " The commercial banking system needs rescuing , " says Saxon grandly-and he has set out on what he considers a rescue mission by permitting national banks to branch out more freely than state banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branching policies , he aims to break the hold that many small-town and suburban bankers have on their areas . Critical state bankers charge that Saxon 's expansion plans would cause many of them to fail under the pressure of big-banking competition . They also fear that many state banks may have to seek national charters in self-defense , thus destroying the U.S. 's " dual system " of banking . <P> No Friend at Chase Manhattan . Last week the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association in Washington heard the strongest anti-Saxon attack ever made by a big , prestigious banker . Said David Rockefeller , president of Manhattan 's state-chartered Chase Manhattan Bank : " I believe the Comptroller would be well advised to show greater restraint in exercising the immense power he now possesses . It would be a dubious honor for him to go down in history as the man who undermined the dual banking system . " <P> Like many state bankers , Rockefeller has a particular reason to be upset . Saxon has permitted Manhattan 's First National City Bank to open 26 branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far been limited by New York State to only eight branches . Beyond that , Saxon wants to permit national banks to offer longer and bigger mortgage loans and to extend their limits on other loans . This is all the more controversial because some federal officials are worried that bankers are already taking on many bad credit risks . <P> No Help from Bobby . Saxon has been colliding with strong forces ever since 1961 , when he came to Washington from a job as counsel to Chicago 's First National Bank . He has quarreled with Bobby Kennedy about the Justice Department 's attempts to block bank mergers , with the Federal Reserve Board about whether banks should be allowed to underwrite state and municipal revenue bonds , and with the Securities and Exchange Commission over whether bank stocks should be regulated by the SEC . Last spring , after Saxon asked regional banking supervisors to drum up support for him among the national bankers , he came within a digit of being sacked by President Kennedy .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
