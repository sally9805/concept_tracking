THERE were drag queens mingling with society matrons , rock ' n ' roll blasting through the halls where Rembrandt and Velasquez once reigned in hushed glory , and costumes ranging from fringed buckskin to China Machado chic . " Peace Now " buttons blossomed on satin evening gowns . Pamphlets denouncing David Rockefeller , Viet Nam and the art market were dispensed along with cocktails and tiny sandwiches . Outside , pickets protested the lack of black and women artists in the show . Manhattan 's venerable Metropolitan Museum had never before been host to anything quite like it , a fact that was duly lamented by diehard traditionalists . The occasion ? The Met 's 100th birthday . With the opening last week of its first centennial exhibition , the museum seemed to be deGlaring that it had no intention of getting any older . <P> Gone were the velvet mounts , the El Grecos and the Goyas , all removed to temporary quarters . In their place were white walls and gray carpeting . And for the first time in the museum 's history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Painting and Sculpture : 1940-1970 , " was organized by the Met 's controversial curator of contemporary arts , Henry Geldzahler ( see box , page 81 ) . A gargantuan display spreading over 35 galleries , a space that would easily accommodate the entire Museum of Modern Art , it traces the ascendancy of Abstract Expressionism through its later manifestations in hard-edged abstraction on to the violent reaction that coalesced in Pop art . Essentially , it is the story of American art 's coming of age . <P> <P> As history , the Met 's show is selective and flawed . Geldzahler has limited his exhibition to what he calls the New York School , by his definition a stylistic rather than a geographic limitation , and focused on what he sees as the central figures in the international modernist tradition . Given this definition , however , it is hard to see why he left out such major artists as Naum Gabo , Louise Nevelson , Sam Francis , Mark Tobey , William Baziotes , Richard Lindner , Larry Rivers , Marisol and Lee Bontecou . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geldzahler has assembled the most exhaustive survey ever of the period . <P> Something special happened in Manhattan in the early 1940s . For one thing , many of Europe 's most innovative artists sought refuge in New York during <P> World War II . From Holland came Piet Mondrian , from Germany Hans Hofmann and George Grosz , from France Fernand Leger , Andre Masson , Arshile Gorky and Max Ernst , providing the new generation of U.S. artists with direct links to Cubism ana Surrealism .
