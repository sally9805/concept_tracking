The Hovercraft is becoming less of a novelty and more of a serious mode of transportation . A vehicle that skims on a cushion of air over land , ice or water , the Hovercraft carried 370,000 passengers on brief trips along the St. Lawrence River during Expo 67 and proved to be one of the fair 's most popular attractions . Now it is being used for such diverse purposes as ferrying passengers between British coastal resort towns and hunting down Viet Cong in the swamps of the Mekong Delta . <P> Last week the so-called air-cushion vehicle ( ACV ) got its biggest commercial test when a 165-ton SR.N4 , the world 's largest Hovercraft , was introduced on regularly scheduled passenger runs across the English Channel between Dover and the French coastal city of Boulogne . The thrice daily round-trip crossings , which will be expanded to six starting this week , are of crucial importance to the British Hovercraft Corp. , which builds the SR.N4 . " Our necks are on the chopping block , " admits Richard Stanton-Jones , managing director . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Among those watching the cross-channel undertaking most closely are Japan 's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Buffalo-based Bell Aerosystems Co . Both companies manufacture their own ACV versions , also serve as British Hovercraft licensees . The fledgling industry 's leader , British Hovercraft , was formed in 1966 by Westland Aircraft Ltd. , Vickers-Armstrongs Ltd. , and the government-run National Research and Development Corp. , which together have pumped $48 million into the craft 's development . <P> Profits are still a long way off , but British Hovercraft is thinking big . Applying the hover principle to industry , the company is currently producing , mostly on an experimental basis , an air-cushion pallet called " Float-a-Load , " which can be used to move industrial equipment weighing up to five tons . Its hopes are highest for the $4,000,000 SR.N4 , whose potential market over the next ten years could exceed 100 orders if all goes well on its showcase channel crossings . <P> For the maiden voyage , the 250-passenger 30-car craft was about two-thirds filled as it whooshed over 3-ft. waves to Boulogne at 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and passengers were further inconvenienced by the fact that the new service does not yet have direct railway links to either London or Paris . The British Railways Board , which operates the crossings , hopes to eliminate most of the kinks in the next few months . Despite an adult fare of $8.40 , compared with $6.24 for a regular ferryboat , most of last week 's travelers seemed more than satisfied . <P> The Hovercraft , after all , made the 26-mile crossing in just 35 minutes , nearly an hour less than the ferry 's timetable .
