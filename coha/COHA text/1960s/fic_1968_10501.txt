there is no discharge ; but Professor Dodd , the old campaigner , could be seen , another field won , as safereturnedto summer quarters . Weapons stacked and guards dismounted , he may now rest easy on these his latest laurels , out of danger , out of harm 's way while he waits for August thirtieth to bring another birthday around . Why should this year be different ? Conceived possible by me or not , my grandfather had ten years of life left him on the night I so gravely concernedmyself over the possibility of his nonsensical memoirs soon appearing in print . As it happened , I need n't have felt concern . The book never came out , though not because of clever contrivings of mine . Factors unforeseen by me were to enter . One of them was that my grandfather , moving on into his nineties , developed an increasing inattentiveness , a general infirmity of purpose . Much of what he was formerly interested in could be seen to interest him no longer  --  toward the end , not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal of the time he just forgot it  --  remembered neither what it was about nor that he had written it . Yet also involved may have been a half-conscious , largely unadmitted recognition of exactly the hazard to the repute he enjoyed that I worried over . I suggest the recognition was never fully conscious or fully admittedbecause I have come to know the aging mind 's commoner habits . Lines of thought are pursued to a certain point , maybe far short , maybe just short , of thinking the thing through and there dropped . The place they were headed for , the logical final conclusions , may remain no more than adumbrated . Never definitelyarrived at or accepted , they may still , without be/ing quite reached , be acted on . All around him the old man saw evidence overwhelming that during the past twenty years he had been turned little by little into a legend . Even supposing senility brought him to pretty well credit the legend himself , moments might come when he heard counsels of prudence , glimpsed the great truth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , to let them alone . Could legend now full grown benefit , have anything to gain from , extended rakings up of the past ? Not possibly ; and in affairs of this kind where you do n't stand to gain you stand to lose . My grandfather did seem past realizing the vapidity , the vacuousness in his piles of writing , and so perhaps never understood the real risk to his reputation ; yet he might understand perfectly the general chance he would be taking . I 'm inclined to doubt that he ever ' decided ' publishing would be unwise ; but he would n't need to . Aware , or half aware , of potential dangers that lay in publication , he could let the whole business slip slowly into the limbo of lost interests , into the keeping of forgetfulness , and , so , happilymake any concern of mine uncalled for . My own life experience has led me to think a good deal about my grandfather and his legend , about legend-making  --  thebreeding of legends , or in the heart or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here to be thought on are tides in the affairs of men , chance 's often unbelievable ( yet ordinary ) concatenations of surprise and accident , peradventure 's intrusive role in the course of events , and that matter of the mind 's mis/finished , they bow themselves out to let Professor Dodd get ready for his supper . While in the years of the full-grown legend this little closed ceremony with its slightly discomfiting note of the mannered or affected ( legend 's very nature must make for the struck pose , the formal stance , the act put on ) came to constitute the whole of the birthday party , ' it was by no means the whole of the celebrating of ProfessorDodd 's birthdays . The mail that morning would not be delivered by the postman on the route . There was too much for him to carry ; it filled a separate bag dropped off by a post-office truck . By then my grandfather'sreputation as seer and sage , as profound scholar and inspired teacher , had been spread , rising as it spread , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spoken of everywhere as Cubby , ' he was generally known and generally revered throughout eastern academic circles , and with customary results . Every year , perhaps every day , new wise , new shrewdly witty , sayings projecting that persona of the good gray professor were ascribed to him . Stories to illustrate his encyclopedic knowledge and intellectual prowess multiplied , all of them pure fiction but getting wider and wider currency as fact . To stuff the morning mailbag , former pupils , onetimeassociates , eminent fellow workers in his fields ( by now most would never have known him , only this grown reputation of his ) were by scores writing to expressrespect , to convey esteem or affection , to congratulatehim and wish him well . With such letters piling higher every year  --  his ninety-fifth birthday brought Cubby warm congratulations which , if perhaps not per/sonally written by him , were on the President of the United States 's official stationery , and personally signed by him  --  the college and all connected with it could not but find the festive day one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and on the institution the Grand Old Man shed ever-greater luster . Other schools might have feathers of a sort in their caps ; but had they a Cubby ? Not they ! From the legend it might naturally be presumed that Professor Dodd had begun the building of so great a reputation early in his teaching career . His remarkable abilities and rare qualities of mind , you would imagine , always had been his and had always been recognizedand acknowledged by what his small-college situationwould make the limited little group able to be aware of them . Virtually none of those who paid my grandfather ( and themselves ) the annual tribute of later years ever knew or could have been brought to believe that the concept of Grand Old Man got its slow uncertainstart around the time retired Professor Dodd turned seventy-five . The tide of nearly national renown ( witnessthe White House letter ) entered on its impressive rise only as he neared eighty-five . What made the concept 's first taking form slow and uncertain would also be quite unbelievable to Cubby 's later venerators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around that Cubby was among the great teachers of his time and also a scholar of immense learning , men who had been my grandfather 's colleagues while he was actually teaching , to whom he had been known for years , and who were still members of the col/lege faculty probably dismissed it as somebody 's little joke . They may be guessed to have thought such a claim so ridiculous ( even that appellation , afterward fond , of Cubby '  --  he signed himself E. Cuthbertson Dodd  --  had been used mostly in undergraduate derision and disrespect during his teaching years ) that any nipping of the legend in the bud , then probably possible , seemed needless . By the time the legend had , plain to see , become one , and no joke at all , many of those who might have spoken were dead , and of those still alive most would have to consider what motives could be imputed to them if they spoke now ; while I think a few , whether merely doddering , whether at an age to see themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a helping hand , to providing purportedeyewitness testimony to the truth of it , to rememberingnothing more . Unremembered by them were the circumstances of Professor Dodd 's retirement . ' He had clung to his chair until he was seventy and would have clung longer if means to oust him had n't been laboriously devised . ( Minutes of trustee meetings survive to show that the difficulty of getting rid of him was a principal argument for adoption of a college rule that made retirement mandatory at sixty-five unless the dean of the faculty tendered a specific ' extraordinary ' request for temporarylonger service . ) Nor did that tell all . You needed to know the ouster was engineered notwithstanding definitefinancial loss the college incurred . On the death of his mother , daughter of Hosea 's son Professor Caleb Cuthbertson , my grandfather came into control of a much larger share of the Cuthbertson-Alwayne money.  |p107His  income , ample already , was so far increased that he felt himself in a position to , and he did , turn back to the bursar the whole of his endowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so generous a gesture would be about one in ten thousand , and even on that uncommonly well-off Faculty Row of the college 's , nobody else made it . Professor Dodd 's making it was hardly calculated to endear him to his fellows and associates  --  neitherthose well off who did not see their way to following his example , nor the larger number who ( though some of them full professors ) could not live on Faculty Row , having no money but what the college paid them . Their state of feeling might be very much the one that is so common in the world of arts and letters . Few things are more galling than to see a man doing the kind of work you do yet ( just what makes it possible wo n't matter ) living high on the hog while you pinch and scrape . Our human nature turns a bitter critical eye on him , and such scrutiny is apt to bring feelings that his good fortune is undeserved and to lead to a looking out of faults of his that will show as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults manifold and even monstrous are n't found in him and his work , and more remarkable still if chances to set them forth are lost . I also ca n't doubt that it was this independence of independent means enjoyed by Professor Dodd  --  the collegewas his pensioner , not he the college 's  --  that did most to inspire the virtual hate with which Arthur Abernethy , then the college 's president , came to regard him . I make the point in fairness to my grandfather . In fairness to those lookers-out of faults , even if they looked through envy and resentment , or , like Presidentp108Abernethy , through enmity of wounded pride of power , I think it will have to be admitted that the looked-for when found and set forth , was not made out of whole cloth . Hidden in their eagerness to denigrate Professor Dodd might lie motives little to the credit of those hostile to him , but resulting charges brought by them were not all dishonest or all unreasonable , given the existing situation . The situation was that Arthur Abernethy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so after my grandfather accepted the Breck chair , came to his office highly resolved to revolutionize an institution which if old and long known  --  even in a minor way famous  --  was weak in every form of scholarship and of low academic repute . The new President was determined to change things . At the time of his induction he was a big forcefulman of fifty  --  he used to be known unopprobriously as ' A. A. ' ; but also as The Ape , ' which if unkindly not altogether unjustly described his physical appearance . He bore a string of good degrees , degrees hard to earn , not hollow , but his real talents were administrative , and the good degrees served more to let him know what genuine learning was than to make him learned . Knowingwhat learning was , he meant to make the college into an institution of learning of the first order , with standards recognized everywhere as those of excellence and everywhere respected . Starting out , A. A. , big and forceful though he might be , lay under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some college presidencies . Then there were several of the trustees ( the new presidentfound getting them replaced slow work , since pe/riodic election for stated terms was not at that time in the ruling Laws of Order ) who could only conceive of a college as social and sporting club . Its proper studies were athletic contests , fraternity life , and alumni reunions . Since all three were in a flourishing state they saw no need for any kind of change . Then there were those many among the reunioning alumni who , never greasy grinds themselves , did not want their sons to have to be greasy grinds . Then there were their High Mightinesses , the Faculty Row professors , every one of them naturally long and well satisfied with the courses of instruction he gave given as he gave them , and with the quality of his own teaching . That the college little by little did definitely begin to change testified to President Abernethy s abilities in manipulation , in getting around difficult people , as well as to a truly dogged tenacity of purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming evident even before the First World War , that the Bright-CollegeYearsbrief era of the ' go 's was done ; the tables down at Mory 's , and fight , fight for every yard , and stands our noble Alma Mater , and all that , things of the past ; and the irreversible tide of change full set against the kinds of opposition A. A. faced . However , time had still to run before they were wholly swept away , and as first changes in the college began , each small success won by the new President alerted opposers again , alarmed them more , made them more stubborn in recalcitrance . As years went by , President Abernethy was also , I think , suffering from the effect of his successes on him personally . They provided proof that wanted change was not impossible , and , so , could increase his impatience to bring changep110about in shorter order . He redoubled his great exertions , and symptoms of overstrain resulting were soon to be seen in an impairing of the judgment and discernment through which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise sight actual objectives . The discernmentlet him pick tactics and minutiae of persuasion  --  telling him , for example , just when a conceding of what was n't very important could be means to win what was . Unimpaired , I think they would have told him that if the good of the changed college seemed to him to requireProfessor Dodd 's resignation , feuding with ProfessorDodd was not the way to get it . Of course in stand of opposition to my grandfather the new President could count on the kind of undergroundfaculty support whose motivations I have suggested . As his project proceeded , as inch by inch ( man by man ) he got the faculty about a quarter made over in the image he proposed , he was gathering more support . Without doubt a consensus of abler new members would be that Professor Dodd amounted to no great shakes either as teacher or as scholar . Indeed , what on earth was he professor of ? What was Psychology and Moral and Ethical Culture ' ? Professor Dodd , accepting an establishedchair ( you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar ideas entertained by Mr. Breck , a devoted early alumnus and wealthy manufacturer of paints and varnishes who set up and munificently endoweda chair he chose so to name near the turn of the century ; but this did not prevent my grandfather 's enerniesfrom declaring that no man of real intellectual parts or genuine learning could ever have let himself be named professor of stuff and nonsense.  |p111Similarly  , if you wanted to run down Professor Dodd , the propriety of his listing a medical degree after his name could be questioned . That he held the degree was not to be denied ; but it was not to be denied either that the degree came from a dubious institution which went out of business ( the right word ) even before medical schools ' of the sort were finished off by the Flexner Report . Moreover , Doctor ' Dodd never had been licensed to practice , and his detractors , rightly or wrongly , insisted that where acceptable standards prevailedhe never could have got himself licensed . If objectionwas made that the license was irrelevant , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaken medical studies only as an adjunct to his studies in psychology  --  and , however substandard the school 's courses , he could hardly help gaining a knowledge of anatomy and physiology greater than the average psychologist 's  --  the detractors could and did hotly answer that what remainedas relevant as ever was the ( to their minds ) disingenuousness , if not outright dishonesty , of hitching an M.D. to your name when you could n't show you were qualified to practice medicine . Let me parenthetically admit the fascination that such small puzzles of lost past facts have for me . Some of them I ca n't quite get out of my mind . They are trifling , the answers if learned of no possible moment , yet the tantalizing why , why , why of them keeps nagging me . That semispurious medical degree of my grandfather 's is , of course , one . The scanty facts of record present enigmas or oddities I am not able to put in order . For a young man who planned to teach psychology ( in those days looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a medical degree as a proper or necessary first step might be intellectually possible  --  indeedeven an indication of unusual intelligence  --  butit can not be made to seem probable . However , the improbable allowed , what in reason can explain the picking of the kind of medical school he picked ? The general public could perhaps have trouble in distinguishing a mere diploma mill from medical colleges that offered instruction , by the best standards of the day , sound ; but my grandfather , born and brought up in academic circles , even if not those of the larger universities , could have had no trouble finding out which the good schools were . My perplexed questioningsare vain . I note them only because most of us may from time to time want reminding that to have our conclusions correct we will often need to know what , now known to no one living , can never be known . I am left to wonder whether his situation could not have been a little like my own when young . While growingup , my grandfather , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented from settling on anything he particularly wanted to do and , like me , he was under no pressure of poverty to decide . His father had personal means as small as a professor ( and minor poet ) would usually have , but his mother , Caleb Cuthbertson 's daughter Dorcas , was richly provided for , so a child of theirs could take his time about choosing an occupation . My notion is that his choice when he made it amounted to one of protest or defiance  --  he chose not to follow in Professor William Dodd 's footsteps . Perhaps he resented that pressure of doing what comes naturally , a paternal **27;8985;TOOLONG of what he was going to do ;  |p113but  possibly , also , a circumstance in his parents ' life which I will speak of later made him emotionally hostile , had him bearing his father a grudge . Feelings of the kind could explain very well a declaration of independence in the abrupt announcement that he would be a physician , and a deliberate making of his arrangements without asking anyone 's advice  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My further notion is that by the time his medical studiesended he had come to find medicine not at all to his taste . With no wish to practice it , he never sought a physician'slicense . The doing what came naturally could now take over ; since through tradition 's compulsion he had to do something , he might as well teach , and I must suspect what he taught was determined not by what interestedhim but by what was the best opening among those the college had at the moment available to a young man with the family influence to get one offered to him . It just happened to be in the Philosophy Department , which was then small , Natural Philosophy '  --  botany and geology , chemistry and physics  --  having been not many years earlier separated from it . The teaching staff consisted of a single full professor  --  the Breck chair had yet to be established  --  an assistant professor , and two lecturers . ' My grandfather became one of the lecturers . I find difficulty in picturing him as he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man that childhood impressions I might have of Grandfather ' when he was not yet really old are overlaid by later ones . When I try to visualize him at thirty or forty I have to help me no more than a little packet of old photographs . I have seen only one that shows the youngp114lecturer . This is a group picture of the college faculty taken what would have been the first year he was a member of it . Many of the seventy-odd individual faces , though in a twelve-by-fifteen print necessarily small , come quite clear under a magnifying glass . Unfortunatelymy grandfather chose the moment of exposure to move his head . A few later snapshots were preserved , most of them made at the shore at Old Harbor . They are undated  --  one shows him wearing a bathing suit whose cut suggeststhe middle 18go 's  --  but in all except the bathingsuitpicture , where a floppy hat deeply shades his eyes and nose , he is in a group of people  --  Old Harbor summerneighbors , or family connections ( his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making my mother and father third cousins  --  a niece of PresidentSeth Pierce of the college , President Abernethy 's predecessor ; his children  --  my mother , Nancy , and her brother , my Uncle Timothy  --  and older relatives now not possible for me to place or identify ) . They picnic on the bluffs , they play battledore and shuttlecock or croquet , they walk in a line on the beach , and my grandfatherseems always to be caught looking away , turned around , or half concealed by some of the others . The earliest perfectly clear picture I have found was leafed in as frontispiece to an article of his in a 19 ( 37 number of the American Psychologist , and obviously the almost cataleptic staring stiffness common in commercial studio portraits of the time is much distorting it . You are shown a high forehead , a high starched collar , and a curved thick roll of short mustache . While definitionis sharp , an ill-chosen camera angle results in whatp115I can feel sure is a loss of actual likeness , since the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , a face distinguished by certain features descending in a family , as sometimes they do , generation after generation . His mother 's father had them , though in the college library portrait of Caleb Cuthbertsonthey are half hidden by a voluminous chestnut beard . My mother had them . They bypassed me , Worthingtongenes , or perhaps , more probably , compounded Pierce ones , prevailing , but a strong suggestion of them reappears in my daughter , Elaine . With the women , no doubt because of normally slighter , more delicate femininebone structure behind them , they are usually featuresof winning attractiveness . Only as rendered in that magazine photograph of Professor Dodd do they have a faintly foxy look  --  just a hint of the shallowly inquisitive , the craftily devious . Whether or not the picture tells you anything true about my grandfather 's temperament or nature , the frontispiece picture 's presence in a learned periodical does tell you that he had not been backward in making himself a contributor to such periodicals , or in engaging in projects of research  --  activities President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's academicimage , ' might be expected to applaud , but ProfessorDodd 's detractors had opinions there , too . Both his writings and his projects , they insisted , brought the college not repute but ridicule . One of his projects I clearly remember . I would then have been little more than a child , and though I could not now say why , I felt , I recall , the liveliest interest . This particular project had to do with sleep , or , morep116exactly , possible effects of prolonged sleeplessness on mental and physical processes . My grandfather assembleda group of undergraduate volunteers ( if the term applies to young men who were to receive for their services one hundred dollars each , a large sum in those days and paid , of course , out of the Professor 's own funds ) . They agreed to allow themselves to be preventedfrom sleeping for as long as possible . They were to undergo a series of tests first administered after a normal night 's sleep and then repeated when they had been awake for eighteen , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as any of them could be kept awake . Predictably , through its human guinea pig ' aspects , the project when announced got the college and ProfessorDodd newspaper space , but serious scientists seemed agreed in making little of the experiment 's possible value even if ( as they said was not the case ) proper controlsand monitoring had been provided to assure findingsof specific significance . As it was to happen , there were no findings of any kind , because the college MedicalDirector intervened . Since some of the tests involved use of gymnastic apparatus , the volunteers were quarteredin the college gymnasium 's wrestling room . ( That no one felt able to refuse Professor Dodd the use of college facilities sheds , I think , interesting light on powers of a Faculty Row professor . ) Into this room shortly before the twenty-four-hour tests were scheduledmarched the Medical Director  --  his M.D. was impeccable  --  escortinga deputy sheriff . The sheriff produced a court order , issuing on the Medical Director 's representation that it was not known , and certainlyp117not by Doctor ' Dodd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a restricted oxygen supply might not be caused by sleeplessness designedly protracted , and enjoining him from proceeding with his project . The result was even more newspaper publicity for the college , but not of a kind to please President Abernethy . In the matter of publication ' Professor Dodd , a rapid and , also according to his detractors , unclear and dully prolix writer , was early turning out learned articles with all the frequency and regularity anyone could ask . ( Since his contributions seem to have met with ready acceptance , it is possible they had more merit of one kind or another than his enemies cared to admit . ) A psychologist in those days was generally a philosopher , too , or perhaps first a philosopher , and it was my **26;9014;TOOLONG papers that were the preferred target of the detractors . They charged him with being a positivist one moment and a phenomenalist the next . His views were said ( and proved ) to be now monistic and now dualistic . They assailed him for writing as an associationist some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They reproached him for seemingeither unaware of or undisturbed by any **25;9042;TOOLONG a system of pluralism plus pragmatismplus radical empiricism necessarily produced . If most of this could also be said , and I am assured by men of learning more than mine that it can , of my grandfather 's so highly distinguished **36;9069;TOOLONG William James , what was offeredin defense of James  --  he was dedicated to ' heuristic ' principles ; his was the Socratic aim of inciting pupilsp118to think things out for themselves  --  might , I suppose , be offered in defense of my grandfather . If I seem doubtful , I 'm afraid it 's because in reading some of those long-ago published pieces of his  --  my work has trained or accustomed me to read with patience where most people would n't  --  I see in them , while not a qualified judge of their content , signs of what I am qualified to judge , since equivalents of it turn up in our business research . My grandfather 's inconsistencies have to me a look of being due more to his forgetting what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and antithesis should be kept confronting each other . Though regular acceptance for publication of my grandfather 's work might be proof that it was n't as stupid and empty as those hostile to him held it to be , they were not wrong in pointing out , as they constantly did , that there was no evidence of his making through his writings his professional mark as pace-setting thinker or accepted authority . Publishers did n't compete to commission him to do definitive books for them . Learned societies of which he was a member exhibited anything but eagerness to bestow on him that recognitionwhose solid form is office , honors , and awards . Clearly Professor Dodd had n't arrived , and , moreover , he did n't even look like a rising or coming man . This was the state of my grandfather 's professional fortunes and reputation at mid-career , and chances of a change at that , it would then seem , late date looked poor . The attention he was about to attract must have been the last thing anyone , himself included , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think nicely , what chance may do in our affairs to changep119without notice that which at any given moment we see as the chances . ' The mid-career estimate of the chances of a change rested evidently on the assumption that only new , original , preferably massive work of Professor Dodd 's own could bring change . Overlooked are possibilitiesthat might lie in developments analogous to what the stock market knows as Special Situations . Here the special situation was the controversy then commencingover theories of Sigmund Freud  --  what I spoke of when I told of my looking uneasily at his memoirs ' the night my grandfather fell asleep . Few workers in the field of psychology were inclined to be receptive to theories so startling and often so altogetherinconsonant with received dogma of the day . Nevertheless , by their work 's very nature their minds were generally kept open . To most of them , rather than flat rejection , the right course would normally seem one of judgment reserved until the presented propositions were gone into further and evidence that might support them more fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , there were those to suggest that Professor Dodd in acting otherwise acted as an opportunist , cannily and from some standpoints a trifle unscrupulously , speeding to turn reserved judgment'sjuncture to his own account . I feel reasonably certain that there was in fact nothing canny about it . My grandfather blundered , speedily , to be sure , but blindly , into his unanticipated prominence . Be that as it may , while others hesitated  --  many perhapswith the creditable wish to give new doctrines a fair hearing , to wait before judging until something closer to the whole corpus of the work became availa/ble ; some perhaps just playing it safe , waiting to see which way the cat jumped  --  my grandfather did n't hesitate . He seems to have had a fair amount of German , and in his manuscript memoirs you gather ( though he does n't say so outright ) that already read in the original ' was a great amount of material before first articles  --  short , introductory in character , hardly more than progress reports on European acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  appeared in English here . I must doubt that he knew when he entered on his quick rebuttal quite as much as he later implies he knew about the quarrels and schisms ( indeed , not all of them had yet occurred ) involving Jung , Adler , Stekel , Rank , Reich , or Lou Andreas-Salome 's idolatrouspractices , or Georg Groddeck 's dubious projectionson the psychosomatic origin of organic disease . I think he may quite innocently have later confused what he knew at first with what was dug up at following stages of the controversy when he needed to defend his position . Still , in his first article he comments on Freud 's relationship with Wilhelm Fliess , the eccentric numerologist , and a footnote seems to prove that he had seen Fliess 's 1897 monograph on ( the note takes care to leave it untranslated ) Die Beziehungen zwischen Nase and Weibliche Geschlechtorganen . This certainly does suggest that Professor Dodd actually had read some of the German material and so when he took his pen in hand was better prepared than many of his fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien and in the eyes of those days often flagrantly obscene . ( Myp121grandfather 's first paper speaks of false emphases of fact and non sequiturs in logic . ' It is full of phrases like : ' He misconceives the role and underrates the importance of . . . ' and . . . not much critical force is found in these conclusions . . . . ' ) The sensation , at least in that self-contained little specialists ' world for which he wrote , was immediate . I think one may safely guess that a good many of his readers , though not themselves ready to venture pronouncementson theories still undigested and evidence far fromall in , had anxious hopes that Dodd was right . Di- gested or undigested , the new theories threatened what for many men was work of a lifetime . Freud 's corningto prevail , even if only in principle , must force a general discard of earlier ideas and consequent discreditingto some degree of those who held and taught them . ( I have reflected with interest that an upset of this kind would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given its presently accepted form and Max Planck 's earlier uncertainty relation  --  no connection with my own uncertainty principle  --  was developedby Heisenberg and Niels Bohr in dispute with Einstein , who remained dubious of anything not ' deterministic . ' The difference in their differing was that no one had vested interest in established error . Socalledclassical physics ' rested classically , impersonally , on proofs agreed by all , in the state of knowledge of the times , to be conclusive . New proposals were subject to challenge when proposed , but only until the truth ofthem came to be adequately established , and therep122could be no serious dispute , since free and open scientificdemonstration was required , about what constitutedadequate establishment . ) Such hope , such anxiety-ridden concern , of the **28;9107;TOOLONG a science ' so uncertain and inexact as psychology guaranteed my grandfather 's rapidly turned-out statements of objection to novel theory eager readings , readings more sympathetic and far more respectful than any past work of his had ever been given . Professor Dodd was the faithful champion of the status quo . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intrepid , he sallied forth to mount and maintain on behalf of conservatives just that all-out attackwhich is a threatened position 's best defense . The wishful glad word was repeatedly given and quickly passed along : Do n't miss Dodd in . . . ( whatever learned journal was printing him that month ) . He utterlydemolishes . . . ( whoever had in some previous number ventured a defense of the theories ) . He does n't leave Freud a leg to stand on . . . For a while those who took care not to miss Dodd might warm with the comfortable feeling the question was settled once and for all and so hold high the man who did the settling . It was , I 'm sure , a trying time for President Abernethy and the others whose serious consensushad been that for the good of the college , of the college 's academic good name , my grandfather ought to be got rid of . The attention now given him was different indeed from the occasional notice , mostly in the form of confutations and charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or from newspaperpublicity gained by research ' like that sleep proj/ect  --  not to mention later animal experimentation , in some of which , using a device of striking resemblance to the later notorious Noble-Collip drum , he set about inducing nervous breakdowns in laboratory cats and dogs ; and of course soon had animal-welfare leagues ' putting out press releases to denounce the college . Here he was making his name ( and academic affiliation ) known , and as yet almost nowhere unfavorably known , to every university psychology department and to practicallyevery individual psychologist of standing in the country . The plight of Professor Dodd 's habitual detractorswill be apparent . I think it may have been a little like that of those laboratory animals when my grandfather was busy with his experiments aimed at **25;9137;TOOLONG how best to drive them crazy . One immediate result seems to have been a truce . President Abernethy 's plans to oust Professor Dodd were shelved in short order . There was no real peacemaking and no evidence that A. A. liked him any better than before . True , Dodd was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing the President wanted done , and he would n't cut off his nose to spite his face , yet it was surely a sore trial to have Dodd the one to be doing it . When winds of change in psychology 's intellectual climate , bringing signs that anti-Freudians had stopped having things all their way , began to rise , I suspect PresidentAbernethy , cost though it might the college 's brief gain in reputation , was joyful . What , with passage of time , the signs were showing was that despite hopings , despite anxiety-ridden wishings , the issue had n't been once and for all settled , that what Freudianism took from Dodd had n't been its quietus , that Freud , thoughp124the future would find out serious errors and lapses in his theory , retained plenty of legs to stand on . Material for which the equitable ( or cautious ) reserversof judgment were waiting had come to be in good supply . The extensive study of principle and practice that translation made possible was soon posing grave questions of whether the side on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even done something like direct and head , was not going to prove the wrong , the losing , side . Another year or so and this became not possibility but certainty . My grandfather'spositions were being rendered untenable and must presently look ridiculous . He seemed undisturbed . He gave not an inch . The id-ego-superego topography of the mind was nonsense . The theory of libido development , with its oral , anal , urethral , or phallic levels , was scatological claptrap . The proposed interpretation of dreams was pornographic idiocy . Unfortunately those who at first applauded and supported such typical contentions of his were more and more of them defecting . More and more of them felt compelled to join in a mass capitulation , to concede the probable basic truth of the upsetting propositions , dissentingonly on detail . A few more years and Professor Dodd stood virtually alone . Moving ahead , psychology as a science was leaving him behind , and his consistency in rejecting all new principles must come to mean a steadily increasing ignorance , by accepted standards , of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the learned societies he was disregarded or dismissed as a preposterous old numskull . As I 've said , I think President Abernethy found thep125fairly quick decline and fall most gratifying , while at the same time his earlier animosity may have been aggravatedby his own mistake in ever letting himself be , as it now seemed , deceived into the truce , and by his current finding that what he took , if against his will , for service Professor Dodd was doing the college had turned into grievous , intolerable disservice . He renewed his efforts to pluck the thorn from his side . President Abernethy was by then a dying man and known to be . Without doubt it was their so knowing that brought a necessary number of trustees , compunctious , to grant what they could see as close to a dying wish . Since ProfessorDodd still flatly refused to resign , they took steps in their corporate power to superannuate him . Their deed of grace may have helped President Abernethy , dying soon after , to die happier . When these concluding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed in review , to feel at least a little sorry for him seems reasonable , natural . Here surely are hard lines ; and surely they would be made no less so by the cutting off of relativeprominence 's short hour  --  at long last a table preparedin the presence of his enemies ; but hardly has he seated himself when it disintegrates and is whisked away . He is back down again while the enemies , more contumelious than ever , are up  --  prepared , eager , and before long able to finish him off . It is a relief to me to feel as sure as I do that sorrowings for him would be superfluous . I see now that my grandfather lived the life  --  and thep126fact 's instruction about our human condition is what leads me to treat of him at length  --  of that rare happy man who ca n't see error in himself . The state must be distinguished from the deceiving of yourself by saying you have no sin , or from any regarding of yourself as morally or ethically superior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults of omissionor commission  --  but in what he did , not in what he thought . This made him proof , as well as against criticism of his work , against slights , rebuffs , and blows to self-esteem . Like another man , he might be angered by them , but , unlike most men , he was not hurt by them . To be hurt I judge you must ( like most men ) harbor in your breast a traitor-doubt , a live and present secret fear that the affronts offered you or the injuries done you could be condign , only your all too just deserts . But , one may ask , can hide and heart of such proof actually be in human nature ? Is it ever in human naturenot to notice that other names are sounded more than yours , that honors awards and offices shower on others , but not on you ? And can it be ever in human nature not , sore tried , to mind ? Considering myself , I would say it can not  --  that is , not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it could bewas  --  inhis . The disposition or temperament that preventedhim from seeing error in himself , that kept him satisfied with his own perfect rightness ( not righteousness ) , could also prevent him from ever seeing himself as someone else might see him . Unless you know degrees of self-dissatisfaction , wishing you like to one more rich in hope , featured like him , like him with friends possessed , desiring this man 's art or that man'sp127scope , how can you feel mortified or humiliated ? You may take a moment 's umbrage at success of others , resenttheir having it , but you do so with no wasting anguishof envy or consuming pang of jealousy . Though you may crave such success for yourself , at bottom you would prefer being yourself as you are and unsuccessful to being successful and not yourself as you are . Such a special variant in my grandfather 's human nature is the sort of thing I find , growing older , so instructive , and it was well displayed when , having been opened , the Freudian controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodd may fairly be held instrumental in making one of the meaner uglinesses an issue and therefore fairly charged with disgraceful conduct . I am inclined to exonerate him . Just as I think he never perceived and so could n't have moved to grasp at possible personal opportunity in the impending dispute , he never , I think , intended to make the ugly issue an issue , never had the faintest idea he was going to raise an issue  --  again , planless and imperceptive , he simply blundered into something , something it seems to me also usefully instructive in the ways of our human nature . What he blundered into was this . Though professingno religion , the early Freudians , like Freud himself , were almost to a man of Jewish extraction . In the course of his first paper on the subject my grandfather made mention of the fact . His mention was no more than passing and , disinterestedly read , seems difficult to take for an expression of anti-Semitism . I 'm sure he intended none , and the possibility of its being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His comment was top128the effect that though this man Freud affected to regard religious belief as a father-image delusion , it might perhapsbe of some interest to observe how distinctively Jewish , how much in keeping with the historical genius of Jewish religious thought  --  rapt , prophetic , poetically visionary  --  a great deal of the teaching really was . Or , my grandfather then appended ( he was too fond of banal tags in other tongues ) , plus ca change , plus c'est la meme chose ? In the phrasing sounds a clear note of condescension , and that of course would be intentional . The **33;9164;TOOLONG is the most used gambit in learned disagreement , so much a part of standard operating procedure that one does n't expect it to provokeanything more than a countering in kind . When , the article having come out , my grandfather was shown a first little spate of letters to the editor excitedly and venomously attacking him , he was doubtless taken aback . As is customary in such sniping , the letter writers took every care not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real motive in bringing them ) what the actual provocation was , and so , to begin with , the very evident Hass would be all the more bewildering , confined as you found it to angry general assertions that in his piece Professor Dodd was a witless disgrace to the profession ; he was a knave , an idiot , a liar , an execrable prose stylist , and totally unqualified to have an opinion about anything . Maybe because my own line of work can involve certaindisingenuous practices , I find , I confess , diatribes like these of special interest . Their methodology is by and large one of misrepresentation , and for this purposep129a good deal of recourse is had to quotings out of context  --  often most ingenious ; for while rancor may weaken general judgment , it frequently sharpens craft , gives deviousnessinspiration . Wonderful to observe are the twists of sense and even total reversals of meaning to be effected in many written lines simply through deleting some that precede and some that follow ; or through artfulellipses indicated by a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences omitted had n't been relevant . When excerpts from pieces published by my grandfather were subjected to nice work of this kind I think no one reading the results would deny that as a writer he comes out sounding less than literate , and as a thinker a perfect fool . Few of us are imaginative enough to recognize and allowfor the power or the prevalence of feelings with which we ourselves never had personal experience , and this might be particularly true of my grandfather . Temperamentally proof against the criticism , the slights , the rebuffs by which the run of men are hurt , he could not know what being hurt that way was like . It followed that he would not , by looking in himself , be able to anticipate how those who were hurt might act . Specifically he could know nothing about the feelings of people against whom forms of bias ' are or have been shown . If he observed , as soon he must have , that Freudiansso virulently assailing him mostly bore Jewish names , I think he might ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see it as signifying anything in particular  --  after all , just as he noted , Freudians of the time were generally Jewish . Quite unconscious of having written anything deroga/tory about their religion , ' or of Jews as a race , he could miss the meaning of venom that said so clearly here was no technical argument over disputed psychological hypotheses . Even after he had finally been stung into turning on those Jews ' I 'm sure he remained baffled , unable as ever to understand that while he might have said nothing intended to be , or by any common consent likely to be held to be , offensive he had assigned them by implication at least a difference , indicated that he thought of them as another breed , not like himself and his fellow gentiles . He touches a very sore spot  --  touching there , the mildest ironic turn of phrase becomes a vicious sneer . He does a cruel despite , and becausenot to be replied to , one that may gall more than any amount of outright abuse or direct traducement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men may feel left him slower to anger than some men , and his anger when belatedly stirred would be always a sort of ire of indignation , not the spitting rage , the furibund anger of the injured , exhibited by those attacking him . Unfortunatelythe one is no prettier than the other , even though the ire ' may take somewhat more account of reason . Asking himself if he did right to be angry , my grandfather easily made himself a demonstration that yes , he did . Regard the written , the printed record ! Hatinghim without a cause , most evident villains were unprovokedlyslandering , abusing , and wantonly misrepresentinghim . Very well , he would pay them back in their own coin . He , too , distilled his decoction of spleen . His attackers , their science fake , their doctrine filthy rubbish , werep131themselves most palpable knaves , idiots , liars , wretchedlybad writers , and now , be it noted , also all Jews . In short , as the attackers saw it he had been forced by them into the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving aside the fact of possible relevance that their own rancor and venom had been to blame for his eventual returning of it ) I ca n't doubt they were here quite right . Given my grandfather 's upbringing , at least a degree of anti-Semitism would almost have to be bred into him . When he was a boy such gentile bons mots as How odd of God to choose the Jews bespoke a settled social attitude by which he could scarcely go unaffected . Soon after he became a professor not a few college communities were beginning to stir apprehensively  --  lookwhat 's happening at Columbia ; look what 's happened at Pennsylvania ; or , as one educatorof the day , pettish , summed it up : Are we to sit still and have our campus overrun with Ikeys and Jakeys ? In the question one may find a touch of wry humor . With that sort of objector to his presence the luckless Jewish youth seemingly could n't win . When , as the case carne to be , he was more often than not Sidney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what vulgar cheek for him to take names to which his people had no historical title . Retaining concepts early and naturally given a cast of prejudice by such environmental constantpressure of suggestion , Professor Dodd , though most of the time without occasion for antipathetic feeling , and honestly unconscious of it , must nevertheless have bias ' lying latent in him , ready for rousing . Vilely ( he thinks ) abused , personally provoked , he will findp132himself well prepared , really preconditioned , to regard the intemperate attacks on him as ample demonstrationthat those Jews ' richly deserved to have said against them everything that their persecutors had in malice been long saying against them . One needs to remember that this engagement of anger and injury never came to more than a spiteful fracas in a very small teapot . The general public heard nothing . The learned world was little interested ( solid scholarship did and does look askance at such stuff ) , and even among psychologists hardly a dozen became directly involved . The rest , if not all indifferent , remained just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the learned periodicals involved were not yet prepared to help heat up the controversy to the point where subscriptions might be canceled . A few of the first vituperative letters of protest ( higher notes of teeth gnashing and chattering with rage by gingerlyabridgement left out ) were printed , and so were some short disagreeing articles in language fairly moderate ( Apparently untrained in scientific method ProfessorDodd shows himself altogether incapable of grasping fundamental principles or comprehending the importance of ... ) . Only in the little liberal subsidized journals of opinion ' ( where such projects as exposing a benighted , backward , narrow-minded , ignorant , and , here for the first time openly so called , anti-Semitic reactionary of a collegeprofessor would always be undertaken with eagerness ) did my grandfather 's iniquities get treatment at real length . In the two pieces that I have seen , the writers took the same line of gravest alarm . Make nop133mistake , here was a crisis in higher education . If any Professor Dodd were to be allowed the status of responsibleteacher , the integrity of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intellectualstandard must follow . These attacks , with their avowed aim and open hope of destroying his reputation , perhaps excusably heightened that ire of my grandfather 's ; but in fact such journals had then as now insignificant paid circulation and , outside their own editors and contributors , very few readers . In law ProfessorDodd would have been hard put ( he thought of bringing suit ) to demonstrate the smallest actionable damage done him . With the airing of these liberal ' views , in manner so sententious , in matter so crooked , the little altercationattained its piffling apogee and promptly petered out . Since Professor Dodd would very soon start looking like the loser , supporters who might have kept his side alive slipped away , while the other side , looking , festive , like the winner , could unwind a little , return to regular work and let the issue resolve itself . Perhaps because he was no longer winning , because he had n't success'sincentives , my grandfather , once his brief final burst of annoyance over the journal of opinion ' pieces passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy himself with questions of extrasensory perception ( his detractors , I am sure , must have said : He would ! ) and had presently turned his whole attention to the laborious devising of complicated tests by which he expected to prove powers of the kind existed . With what I 'm afraid seems like intellectual frivolity , he forgotabout Freudianism . For him the war was ended.  |p134That  his forgetting about the matter did n't end the war for everyone will be no surprise to students of human nature . Anger my grandfather showed was surfaceanger that flash-burned , an ingenuous indignation at unjust ' misrepresentations ( could he in common sense imagine attackers moved as the Freudians and liberals had been moved were going to be just ' ? ) . Such angers can quickly spend . The festering deep-down anger of the wounded , of people hit where they live , spends slowly  --  or maybe never . Several of his enemies are found over a surprisingly long period working into almosteverything they wrote , no matter what the subject , some sneer or denigration to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings , but they wasted their time . They had no chance of disturbing or distressing my grandfather . He had ceased to read the periodicals for which they wrote , and I only know of the persevered-in references because the college librarian showed , as curiosities , a few of them to my father , by then the college 's president . He would say nothing to his father-in-law . My grandfather 's much later reverting to the controversy when composing his proposed memoirs might suggest that he , too , was unforgiving , nursed an ancient grudge . I do n't think so . Off ( at the time ) in pastures new of ESP , busy with his lively and , I 'm afraid , lightweight work , he would n't be giving the stale quarrela moment 's thought . In these notes on my grandfather and his life and times ' I will be seen to have assembled for the most partp135my own thoughts about him and them . I did not intend to attempt a biographical sketch . What I make of my memories of him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been at pains to set down as possibly pertinent to what I am undertaking to tell about my own life and times . When the a priori forms imposed by my particular mind on data supplied to it have processed such memories , here is how he looks . My hope of not missing useful hints afforded by an exampleso striking of the vicissitudes of as-luck-wouldhave-itwill be plain , and slantings of such interest must make what I select to note down say quite as much about me , about the who-says-so of my recount , as about E. Cuthbertson Dodd , the late renowned Cubby . Though at first glance he and I may look unlike , I must see the look could be misleading . We are unlike in that where his tempera never fails to keep him equipped with assurance 's armor of proof , my own leaves me open to doubt , to that principle of uncertainty 's penetrations , to carpings of self-criticism . He was a remarkably impractical professor , of judgment unsound more often than not , unacquainted with business ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the well-known sagacious head of HW Associates . He was cloistered in a college all his life ; in my work I range far and wide in a wide world if anything too much with me . Cloistered or not , my grandfather was for years involved in or made the subject of continual quarreling . My business situation allows me to seek peace and ensue it . In my work I am not called upon to be for or against things . I need neither challenge nor contend with anyone . Disinterest/edness and impartiality are natural part and parcel of service my people and I offer . It is when I ponder some of the known-only-to-me devices and desires of my heart that I ca n't but see a little of my grandfather in me . Reviewing certain things ( again , known only to me ) that at one time or another have happened to me I perceive certain parallels . We neither of us ever suffered real want . Nothing can be more critical or perhaps crucial in the conditioning of a man 's mind than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money 's coming from . Here is a fence and I am with my grandfather on one side of it , all poor people on the other ( even if they were only on it as boys , poor boys , and later perhaps became far richer than those on our side of the fence had been or ever could be ) . Closely tied are the mind-conditioning effects of never having been in any social sense what is today called underprivileged . ' At many junctures both he and I will want understanding . Subjected to something like the Freudian attack on him ( I never was ) , I would be apt to see no better than he saw what I had done ' to make the attackers so devoutly hope I would drop dead , and would not find any more explicable the honest beliefof the haters ( like Goethe they can promise to be sincere , but not impartial ) that all dishonesties they publishedabout him were honest , their criticism of namecallingsound , just , and reasonable . Both of us exhibit this same grave defect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his old age and I quite young  --  came to enjoy essentially unmerited high reputation and regard . We were not born with them ; we did not achieve them as clear consequence of our own ef-136forts ; we had them thrust upon us . The matter of unlike temperament may now re-enter . My grandfather , I am certain , felt no qualm or question , accepted the unmeritedwith easy mind  --  and would I were like him there ! Come now to be known well to me , my character is not one I can admire ; yet a man of piety has written that we should ever strive to be in charity with ourselves as well as with our neighbors.  | IS STILL OUT late-springmorning when Elaine with no notice drove out to tell me her new troubles . I still stand in the knot garden waiting for Elaine to come back from relieving herself and say what plans she has . Waiting , I ruminate . I have known my daughter , child and woman , all her life , yet occasions like this compel me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts about her and her life that I can call to mind  --  is meager set against what I 'm shown I do n't know , what I ca n't know , what I must have lacked the perceptiveness to see , or never had opportunity to observe . In conversations of the kind we were just having that is , serious talk of personal troubles and problems  --  disturbing moments come when I hear us speak as virtual strangers . Familiarities , interjected words of endearment , sound artificial . At any moment her phrasingmay grow stilted , and so may mine . I think our difficulty could be that in her is more of her mother ( common femininity , for one no doubt important thing ) than of me . I fail in perception as often as I do because the me in me does n't meet enough me in her for me to know what it is like to be Elaine . When I address myself to help , my saws occasionally sound wise , my counsel and advice good , but they are too generalized to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't speak them from that clear personal comprehension without which , according to scripture , all is unprofitable . Such thoughts , distressful in their probably subsisting truth , yet how vain , how inutile , I try to dismiss . The morning 's warmth increases , and I step into the pergola against the south wall . It is an open structure whose graceful supports are cast-iron lacework having the form of grapevines with leaves and grape clusters . On the stone-flagged floor pretty chairs cast in the same iron grape shapes and painted white are distributed around a low pedestal table which is a wide circular slab of pink marble . Overspreading the pergola climb a couple of real , big , gnarled , well-leafed-out grapevines . I sit in their shade . I am in a position to look up the garden , through the open doors and bevel of great bow window , into that spacious room of mine . Emerged from the conveniently adjoining lavatory Elaine now comes in sight . At the same moment JonathanLeCato , no doubt returning to find out whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elaine pulls up , startled  --  she could not know Jon was in the room before , observing us in the garden  --  but she is an instant only in recovering . She offers Jon a smile of conscious ( and real ) charm . With confidence of practice she assumes her well-played glamorous part of womanp140meeting man . Subtly she projects attractiveness . I see Jon 's ever-charming smile answer hers . To that projectionhe graciously directs one of his formal , but in him quite unaffected , old-world bows . Chin tilted in a sprightly lift Elaine says something  --  by the gesture she makes , something about my being in the garden . Jon gestures back , clearly saying he does n't need to see me right now , he 'll see me later . They continue to speak . Years back Elaine as a child took to calling him Uncle Jon , ' and Jon , always a ladies ' man ( though he has remained a bachelor ) , found , I think , such expression of affectionate regard agreeable . He still enjoys it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haste , nor will Elaine dismiss him abruptly . For girlish agreeable niece and courtly adopted uncle a passage of light jocose flirtation by custom is in order . Waiting , I return to rumination . I think of Jon , or , rather , of myself and Jon . As I said , I 've known him a long time  --  a good deal longer than I 've known Elaine  --  and no one I see nowadays can occasion so distinct a recall of many parts of my past . What I remember about Jon gives me desultory episodic glimpses of youthful ( and less youthful ) times and customs of mine , bits and pieces perhaps helping toward an alchemic solution of that grand enigma : Who am I ? ( Also producing the elixir of life and penetrating the nature of all things ? ) I imagine my distinct remembering may be accounted for by much about Jon having been always quite out of the ordinary , markedly singular , notably peculiar . One peculiarity is of appearance  --  odd indeed , even disconcerting in its suggestion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't any different now than when I first saw it forty-some years ago , and this is no unfounded fancy . In our preparatory-school class yearbook Jon 's photograph ( he would be roughly seventeen ) shows you his present face , while most of the other pictures ( including mine ) need study before you can believetoday 's man was that boy . The circumstance of the changeless face is , of course , not that Jon continued to look seventeen , but that at seventeen ( and earlier ) he looked in his fifties . Then as now his head , round , you could fairly say , as a cannonball , grew fuzzy short soft hair of a grayish-dust color . His boy 's skin had the same slightly granular quality , rather like fine-textured shagreen . The cast was clayish , though healthy- not unhealthy-looking . From the round face 's center jutted an oddly perfect quarter round of nose . Looking out past the nose 's neat curve were good-sized eyes with a hint of protuberance , a focusedintentness of pupils , in color an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Close lying , they also appeared ( because almost lacking lobules ) symmetricallyround . His straight mouth , generous-sized , was drawn at the corners ( you would not expect it to be until he was old ) by diagonal cheek-fold lines , giving the whole face a sober , mournful air . This is a queer way for an adolescent boy to look , and fellows at school were quick to find it so . Jon came of an old Virginia Eastern Shore family  --  not knowing the good historical reasons for the name 's occurrence there , it , too , we thought queer  --  so his accent and ways of speech differed from ours , sounded funny to us . In a society as primitive as that of schoolboys , the coinbina/Lion asked for ridicule and persecution ; but LeCato , like a number of Southern youths I 've known , had , along with his normal easygoing inoffensiveness of manner , a hidden abnormal ferocity of temper . Left alone , he seemed ( you might think indolently ) disinclined to offer offense , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , fight , attack with murderousblind fury , regardless of numbers or odds against him , any or all who offered it . The soon-discovered fact , while making him no less queer-looking and funnysoundingto us , quickly secured him from the barbaritiesschoolboys are good at practicing , let him live the next thing to a charmed life , untaunted and unteased . The natural-born bullies among us having found out that they 'd better not make fun of LeCato 's face , name , and Southern accent ( which might have kept derisive attention focused on them ) , all three attributes , once Jon stopped being a new boy , ' lost the novelty of oddnessand could be taken for granted . A term or two passingwould have seen him , I think , with an average numberof friends if his own consciousness that he was queer to look at had been absent , had n't led or driven him to adopt airs of reserve in fact going well with the grave formal deportment ' in which he had plainly been schooled as a child . Such airs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not rebuffed with rudeness , was effectively discouraged . Most of the rest of us formed ourselves small circles of special friends ( though these often changed from year to year or even month to month ) with whom we spent the greater part of our free time , taking long country walks together , skating together in winter , going together on town per/mission ' afternoons to spend our allowances at soda fountains , or simply gathering in someone 's room to talk , play phonograph records , and tell dirty stories . Jon never had a place in one of these informal sets or groups , not because of being pointedly left out , with coldness excluded ( a social cruelty now and then visitedon some hapless , unpopular boy ) , but because joining himself to no group he made plain his election to remain aloof , alone . That , you were given to understand , was what he liked . I must doubt that Jon really liked it . He chose it , yes ; but I believe he chose it only because some juvenile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oddness of face would be less remarked if he took care to keep his distance from ordinary faces . When Jon could n't avoid appearing in company or among strangers he managed always , I do n't know how unless it was through that drilling in deportment , ' to act at perfect social ease , but his selfconsciousnotion persisted to some degree , I now realize , for years  --  probably until youth was far enough behind him for him to feel his strange old face could look natural . In college the election quietly continued , Jon joining himself to no groups , avoiding company , makingas few acquaintanceships as possible . Not to know many people happened to be approved social behavior at Harvard then , quite customary , and a freshman could perfectly well reach graduation without having ever spoken a word to or even learned the names of ninetenthsof his classmates , but Jon , on familiar terms with just three , really out-Harvarded Harvard . Of the three , I was one ( and the fact is the other two came to be friends of Jon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at school together Jon had early allowed himself a guarded acquaintanceship with me based on our common interest in stamp collecting . It was no lasting interest , and we both lost it in a year or so , considering it kid stuff , but our stamps brought us as third formers to spend a certain amount of time together comparing collections , trading duplicates , and studying approvals ' sent us by stamp dealers . These were folded sheets of crisp paper with protective tissue where in numbered squares priced stamps were affixed on stamp hinges , and at the time many dealers advertisedoffers of them in boys ' magazines . Supplying , all unsecured , to teen-aged applicants stamps worth , or at least with the asking price of , perhapstwenty dollars might appear very risky , but doubtlessexperience taught the suppliers that when you exerciseda little judgment , made sure the requests came from good ' addresses  --  a reputable preparatory school would be ideal  --  the risk was virtually nil and you might even stand to make sales not otherwise to be made . Suppose at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with payment for any stamps taken from them ? You wrote a firm polite note to the young defaulter 's parents . True , you were without legal recourse ( in no court would stamp collections be held among the necessities of life ) , but you could rarely fail to embarrass such parents into remitting at once  --  and , that being simpler , as often as not for the whole lot . I mention this perhaps to some degree sharp little trade practice because on a winter day of the year Jon and I were in the third form it was to be the means of creating one of those juvenile situations , highly compli/cated and most improbable-sounding when described later , that may quite regularly arise in boarding-school life and through which Jon was brought to abandon enough of his natural ( or put on ) reserve to let us begin to become the close friends we were to remain as long as he lived . The business was started when on that day another stamp-collecting third former named Gowersreceived in the noon mail a batch of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jon 's room with them . Finding neither Jon nor his roommate there , he left the sheets on Jon 's table , planning to come back and get them later . Time : about half past four . Jon and I come into Jon 's room . Outside , it is bitter cold and getting dark . Lights burn . The radiator hisses comfortably . We sit together on the couch cover of Jon 's cot . We are closely examiningGowers 's sheets of stamps . ( The envelope containingthem is addressed to him , so we know whose they are . ) From one sheet five stamps are gone , presumably taken by Gowers for himself . Among the remaining seventy are a couple Jon decides he 'll buy , and one I say I want . Jon , this settled , gets up , returns the sheets to the envelope , and tosses it back on his table . Out of the drawer he takes a Hershey bar and generously offers me half . He then goes over to his roommate 's table at the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a record called " I Might Be Your Once in Awhile . " Music fills the room . An insinuative female voice , fluty in innuendo , thought then to be risque , is singing . . . But I ca n't be true to you , or you , or you .. . when Gowers comes in.  |p146He  is short , fattish , and red-faced . I never liked him . Jon 's manner was not one to show either liking or disliking , but interest in stamps would certainly be all Jon and Gowers had in common . Gowers says : " Find them ? " Jon says : " Yes . " He reaches for the envelope and pulls the sheets from it . " There are two I 'll buy , and Worthington wants one . What were the ones you took ? " Gowers says : " I did n't take any . I wanted a few but they 're too much money . " Jon says : " Some  --  I think it 's five  --  are n't there . " He unfolds the sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record ends ( . . . But maybe your once in awhile will do ) . I get up and stop the machine . Gowers stands bewildered , the sheets in his hand . He says : " Well , they were here . Where are they ? " Jon says : " Search me . How do I know ? " I say : " No , they were n't there . Not when Jon saw them . He showed them to me right away , and I saw they were n't . " Gowers says : " Do n't try to tell me that . LeCato 's got them . " There is an instant of alai using silence . Jon says carefully : " Are you calling me a thief ? " Gowers grows angrily redder . " I 'm saying you took them . Give them back . " I have spoken of those frightening rages which in Jon 's first school months soon won him freedom from persecution . I would have expected one now , but that simply shows how ignorant I was of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no taunting or being made fun of . This was a point of honor , toop147deadly serious , too deathly solemn for loose outbursts of temper . You had been charged with acting basely ; your probity was called in question ; an insult of disgracewas openly put on you . You did not now exchange recriminations or fall to blows . With icy politeness you called out your insulter . Seconds were named and they appointed a time and place where the case of dueling pistols was laid open . Standing faced at a formal interval , with the pistols you settled your difference . Such correctness of code practice was extinct and had been for a hundred years even in Jon 's part of the world , but the principle of formal action clearly remained . It took the at first sight incongruous ( surely a far cry from seconds conferring and the pistol case ) , yet when you thought about it perfectly logical , course of Jon 's going at once to ask , or , rather , demand , that the school council ( the student-government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two fourth-form members ) hold a hearing . What were known as brats ' did not as a rule make demands on a senior prefect , and it says something for Jon and that deportment of his that what he wanted was allowedhim . Tomorrow there would be a special council meeting after night study to examine the matter . An encounteron this curious field of honor being arranged , Jon could await it with the cold calm of the person who knows he is innocent , and Gowers with the indignantconfidence of the person who knows his story is straight . What I said to Gowers was true . When Jon looked at the sheets the stamps were missing . When Jon said he did n't know where they were , that was true , too . Only I knew where they were , because I had takenp148them , and , far from waiting calm or confident , I was in a near-panic as I saw the perilous spot I had , how stupidly , put myself on . No , when Jon and I sat looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them or the first time I had been in the room that afternoon . About an hour before , I had looked in and , like Gowers earlier , found no one there . I noticed the stamp dealer 's envelope on the table . I investigated . The sheets opened , my eye was hit at once by five stamps of a handsomely colored Nigerian issue  --  usually found unused since they were meant for sale to collectors rather than for actual payment of postage  --  picturingAfrican animals . In my album I had a few from this set , but here were higher denominations  --  from a couple of shillings to a pound  --  and so , as to be expected , quite expensive , priced rather beyond my pocket-money means . As every psychologist knows , larceny comes easy to the average thirteen- or fourteen-year-old . The reason could be atavistic , an entered stage of throwback to impulsesof unmoral Early Man , but for a time petty pilferagemay be almost second nature with what is probably a great majority of boys that age . Still , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to have those stamps  --  which , overriding all ordinary foresight and caution of common sense , could compel me to do something so ill-considered , so flagrantly foolish , as to steal what was certain to be missed and , if seen by anyone , instantlyidentified . No matter ; I could n't resist it . Hinge mountings are made to allow easy removal , not damagingthe stamps , so I needed only seconds to detach themp149and with quick care slip them in my pocket . Then I was out of the room , strolling all innocence up Middle Hall . When , watching the quadrangle from the Common Room , I saw , about four o'clock , Jon crossing toward the North Building I ran out , casually intercepting him , and went on with him to his room . What moved me to do this is hard to say . Perhaps a growing sense of my foolhardinesswas beginning to agitate me and once again I obeyed ill-advised impulse . As anyone can see , the sensiblething would be to stay quite clear , know absolutely nothing . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folly . Conceivably with Jon saying he did n't have them and Gowers saying the stamps were gone I , as one of the not too many known stamp collectors , might have been dragged into it by being asked to produce my collection , but even folly as great as mine would n't have made me put the stolen stamps in my album immediately . Keeping them hidden would n't be difficult . However , I did what I did . I was still fairly safe , my real danger lying in what might result from my anguish of agitated nerves , and what resulted was , sure enough , piling a third folly on the original two . Only , as amazinglythe case can be , my patent third folly instead of ruining me worked in all unreason to rescue me . Shaken with trepidation as the council meeting drew near I somehow made myself go to the senior prefect  --  my ill ease passed , I suppose , as anxiety on Jon 's behalf  --  and say I knew Jon had n't taken the stamps and could I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning , like such a fool , to the scene of the crime ) . The senior prefect said all right . I could n't be present while thep150council heard Gowers and Jon , but if that had n't settled the thing the sergeant at arms would come for me and I would be heard . It is eight-thirty in the evening . Members of the council are gathered in their Administration Building official meeting room . The seven classically shaped curulechairs range in ordered semicircle against the polishedoak paneling of the room 's rounded end . By each chair is a small stand with writing materials and little bronze reading lamp . Spread across the broad center panel above the senior prefect 's chair a richly carved , colored , and gilded plaque of considerable size displays the school 's armorial bearings  --  crest with Athenian owl on esquire 's helm lavishly mantled ; shield with or on gules a lion statant regardant , a Tess fretty , and a beehivein base . Below , elegantly furled , a motto scroll presents a Latin declaration in favor of virtue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bareness is ornate , but the presence into which I am usheredby the council 's sergeant at arms is meant to and must strike callow youths as solemn and splendid . ( My sixth-form year I will occupy one of the three prefects ' chairs  --  not the senior prefect 's  --  myself and find the setting stuffy and the proceedings a bore . ) The sergeantindicates that I am to stand under the central bell-metal chandelier , whose clustered bulbs drop a strong light on me . Jon and Gowers have been sent out . I stand alone . Who can doubt I am a damned fool ? The senior prefect says : " All right , Worthington . What do you want to tell us ? " I have a head-spinning sensation , but the very awe/someness of the occasion seems to work to make me rise to it . I say : " Sir , LeCato did n't take those stamps . He could n't have , because they were gone the first time he saw the sheets . I know . I was there . I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Gowers took them himself ? " I say : " Sir , I do n't know anything about Gowers or what he did or did n't do . But the sheets must have been lying there for quite awhile . Anybody could have come in , seen them , and taken the stamps , it seems to me . And I do n't think LeCato ought to be responsible . Gowersshould n't have left them when nobody was there . " With real astuteness a fifth-form council member says suddenly : " You have n't got them , have you ? " I say : " No . " I am calm and easy , because I have n't . I dropped them furtively into the school incinerator this morning . I show no bluster of possible guilt ; I 'm just puzzled . I say : " Why ? Has Gowers been trying to change his story ? " The senior prefect says , but mildly , with a faint smile : " Here , we ask the questions , Worthington . " I say : " Sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The senior prefect looks around the semicircle inquiringly . There is a general shaking of heads . He says : " All right , Worthington . Thank you . You may go . " The phrasing leaves no doubt . Worthington 's all right . I 've got away with it . So I had , though at poor Gowers 's grievous expense , and not merely in money . Jon must have made a good impression . I , through that luck of mine ( even then I had it ) , made a good impression . Gowers , probably as/sertive and angry and , so , insufficiently respectful , would seem to have made a bad one , and I think the idea that Gowers had taken the stamps himself was the council 's . They could n't act on it and they would n't deliberatelydisseminate it ( state secrecy surrounded their proceedings ) , but such things mysteriously do leak out , and that was soon the student body 's idea , too . This gave Gowers a bad spring , with many schoolmates cutting him , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more quarrelsome and unpleasant . The next fall he did not return . On the other hand , Jon could feel I had stood up for him with real staunchness , even going before the council to support him when certainlyI need n't have . More moved than I would have thought possible , he said the following morning he would n't forget . I do n't think he ever did . Elaine has come down to the pergola . She sits across the round pink-marble table from me . She smokes a cigarette , knocking ashes off into one of the small iron scallop-shellashtrays . She says : " Well , I 'm thinking a littleabout not getting a divorce . Then I 'd have to quit getting married . If the right man comes along , maybe I ought to try just living in sin . I know women who do fine that way . " I say : " They may want you to have that impression , but I doubt if many women in fact find it fine . " Elaine says : " Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe toy with , possibilities that come to my loose mind . I mean , I 'm pretty sure I know where I could getp153me a Protector . I think in a modest way I could even pick and choose a bit . " Father wonders if that is true or if she says it because she needs to believe it . Assuming businesslike gravity , he answers : " I do n't think Ned should be left with any sort of hold on you and I think he ought to be proceeded against . To get at that money he 'd have had to forge your signature . I 'll ask Jon to go into it . " Elaine says : " Oh , Lord , must you ? I was just talking to him and I hoped he would n't hear . Anyway , I do n't think I want to . Messy . I 'd have to give evidence . Also , Ned flew to Stockholm on some contract or other the day before yesterday . I do n't think he 'll come back . " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She says : " Honestly , Father , I 'd much rather just write it all off . At least , let 's not do anything for the moment . " She stubs out the cigarette in the scallop shell and immediately lights another . She says : " And that would n't mean I 'd have to ask you for money . I had a hunch Ned might try some monkey business , so I 've got a good deal stashed away he did n't know about . And I can find a job . There 's this decorating firm Mother sells a lot of stuff to . For quite a long time they 've been wanting me to go in with them . " I say : " If you like , consider that , but for the moment you mention I think you 'd better work on getting rid of Ned and nothing else . Leave the apartment . If you want to stay in town , move to mine . I never use it now . Or if you do n't want to , come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide what you really do want to do . I do n't think you know yet . "  |p154Elaine  says : " Darling Father , I know what I do n't want to do  --  I mean , dump myself on you . Make you go to a lot of trouble . And expense . Why should you ? " I say : " One sufficient reason might be you 're my daughter . " Elaine looks at me . She draws deeply on the cigarette . Her face veiled a little by the drift of smoke , she says : " Am I ? Every now and then I 've wondered . How sure are you about it ? " Father is taken aback . Yes , he 's so little able to know what it 's like to be Elaine that he has n't ever before thought of this aspect of the matter of her mother  --  conclusions Elaine might come to . I say : " My dear , if you wondered seriously I wish you 'd said something . I 'm very sure about it . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The virtual stranger , Elaine , now speaks to this adhocvirtual stranger , me . She says : " Well , Father , when I started wondering I could n't very well . You never thought I knew what was going on . I only found out the summer I was fourteen . For all I could tell , she 'd maybe fooled around some when she was first married . What 's really always made me think she might have was that anybody could see I was her daughter . But who ever saw much of you in me ? " Father is again taken aback . Ruminating , had n't I had , if not for her reason , just that thought ? I say : " Yes ; only I can tell you something you may not know . The college library has a portrait of Professor Caleb Cuthbertson . He was my mother 's grandmother 's father . Next time you 're up go in and take a good look at it . You 'll see you 've got the Cuthbertson face , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you do n't see it in me . But it could never turn up in you if anyone else had been your father . You can stop won-dering . " Elaine says : " Goodness , what it is to own ancestors ! And do n't look so distressed , dear . Wondering never bothered me all that much . But I could tell you thought I did n't know , so I could n't possibly have said something . ' Not at that age . " I say : " Yes , I did think you did n't know . " Which , I reflect , is to say that little Elaine and Father had never really met . No perceptiveness or comprehension threatenedthe child-stranger 's safekeeping of her counsels , concealment of her actual feelings . Elaine says : " Of course I worked hard at not letting on I knew . It may have been easier because that was during the war , remember ? So I was n't seeing you all the time . " I say : " Yes , I remember . " Elaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what you did . All I knew was that you were mostly in Washington , or off flying around somewhere . Just the same , you 'd come home for a while sometimes  --  I never understood how you managed it . I remember you in uniform . You were a major , were n't you ? " I say : " Yes ; and quite soon a lieutenant colonel . Sometime , if you want , I 'll tell you how I managed it . It has its ironic or even farcical aspects . " Elaine says : " I guess I gathered some of that . I remember I kept telling friends at school you were a fighter pilot . Still , you 'd only be at the apartment , or Old Harbor , for a day or so now and then , givingp156Mother plenty of good chances most of the time . Once I knew about her I could naturally see what her going out such a lot meant . She 'd leave me notes so I would n't be worried if she did n't get home for dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually had anything on her again , but that may have been because I was n't trying to , never wanted to . Of course , I was supposing you did n't know . Or were you doing it , too ? I mean , just not trying , not wanting to see anything ? " There are reasons why the first question disconcerts me for an instant , but then Elaine at once explains what she meant by the phrasing and , composed again , I can note that the curious fact is I do n't remember . I 'm not sure I did n't , in a transition of successive stages , at some of them choose to act that figure of contempt the mari complaisant  --  especially after I 'd been brought to see Judith could n't help herself . I know that such apparentlycompulsive infidelity when recognized for what it is may come to leave quite unstirred the ordinary incensementof the male in his shock of feeling himself deceived , cuckolded . To avoid answering I say : " But how did you find out ? " Elaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I say seeing her with , I mean seeing her with , that Britisher  --  I think , but actually , they called him Monty  --  whoeverhe was , one afternoon at Old Harbor . " I say : " His name was Montague . He was head of an English exporting firm . He was over about a study of their American branch our people were doing . " Though Elaine gives me what is news to me , that part of the past is so dead I hear it simply as an interestingp157bit of impersonal gossip . I am quite able to see it for the joke it is . Our British client , perhaps not very much wanting to get back to wartime England , stayed on over part of the summer while my associates ( I did n't myself work on it ; I had my fairly heavy Air Force duties ) were doing their lengthy analyzing and drawing up of recommendations . He seemed to have no acquaintancesin New York  --  I got the impression that the firm 's American agents and servants ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would n't have to spend weekends in town at his hotel , I put him up as a guest member at the Old Harbor Club . When , about to go back to England , our recommendations adopted , he made a special trip to Washington to profess himself frightfully obliged to me for everything , I can see he could have meant by everything ' more than I then took him to mean . I say : " He 's one I certainly never thought of . I introducedhim to your mother so she could have him meet some Old Harbor people when he was at the club weekends . But that was just for a month or so , and I would n't have supposed she met him more than occasionally  --  at beach parties , club dances , that kind of thing . How did you happen to see them ? " Elaine says : " Happen is the word . I was out walking on the dunes  --  I do n't know why , but I used to like to  --  and down in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beach towel . I was quite a bit above them , but close enough to see right away that it was that fellow and Mother . I know I did n't believe my eyes , and that 's not just a phrase . Then I was scared stiff . I 'd never been quite sure what men did with women . I suppose I wasp158horrified . In fact , I know I was . More even by that , I think , than by its being Mother . " I am still able to see the joke of Judith and Monty ' on a beach towel , but now I must consider the unpreparedchild , the young girl , surprising them . I check , consternated . The resulting confusion makes me say simple-mindedly : " I take it they did n't see you ? " Elaine says : " They were n't looking . They were pretty busy . It was the middle of the afternoon , and I guess they 'd been down swimming . I could see the bathing suits they 'd taken off . The hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distance from the beach . And there were n't apt to be people wandering around on the dunes . Still , you could n't know someone  --  like me  --  would n't be . Not right then , but afterward , I saw what that showed . Mother was past bothering to be careful . I mean she could always have made him wait , kept him from doing anything until they got where nobody could possibly see them . But she did n't . " My consternation continues . I speak mechanically . I say : " What did you do ? " Elaine says : " Nothing , at first . I suppose I could n't take it in right away , never really knowing about this before  --  what they were doing . Then , somehow , I did know . I guess things I 'd heard , not understanding them , must have started coming back to me . When I could move I just ducked down in a panic and sneaked away as fast as possible . I went to the beach , I think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may have had some idea of drowning myself . I guess I just went home . I remember Mother had to go out to dinner that night . So I saw her only a moment when she was leaving , andp159though I hardly dared look at her , when I did I know I felt  --  well , flabbergasted . Nothing about her was any different . Could I be going crazy ? Had I imagined the whole thing ? Or might it have been another woman who looked something like her ? " I say : " My dear , what a shocking experience . In one way , I could wish I 'd known . In another , I 'm glad I did n't know . " Elaine says : " Oh , I got a shock all right . But I was fourteen , and you 're used by then to suddenly finding out things you never knew before  --  I 'd just begun to menstruate , I remember . You can still get dirty surprises ; you may even still have those drowning-yourself ideas . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's done , once you 've let yourself realize that 's how things are , you do n't go on being shocked by it ; you accept it . You learn to handle it . I 'm not sure how soon , but pretty soon , maybe even by the next morning , I 'd got over beingscared or horrified in any hurting way . " I say : " That I 'd be very glad to believe . " Elaine says : " And of course to help , there 's the sort of gratification you get , at least while you 're growing up , from knowing you know . It can be quite a relief not to have to be confused or puzzled about something any more . Sure , in books you read about that kind of shock being terribly traumatic  --  an adolescent 's supposed never to get over it . But I 'll bet , when that happens , the brat was all along a damn odd brat . " Our summer place at Old Harbor from which Elaine liked to wander out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and father ) had it from her father , my Grandfather Dodd , the eventually famed Cubby , and on Old Harbor Island it continued to be called the Dodd House both when my parents summered in it and later when Judith and I did . As a child I was taken there a few days after the college 's June commencement ( at that time most colleges shut up summers completely ) , and we stayed until the first week in September . When the Old Harbor beach to which Elaine ran with ideas of drowningherself now comes to my mind I seem for some reasonalways to see it as it must have looked to me as a child . I view expanses of dunes as wide as the Sahara with an onshore wind waving their sparse coarse grass . On the bluff ( so much higher to me then ) I see the massiveOld Harbor Club , and beyond , ranging north a mile or so , the sea-front cottages . Though modest compared with what Newport called a cottage , they were substantialhouses . They stood spaced apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none to look isolated . Young Hank , a child on the beach , found the far-flung line imposing , particularly when the house fronts , often bizarre in their i88o architecture , showed softened and somehow expanded through an afternoon 's shining beach haze . Gazing up I was able to please my juvenile fancy by making them out to be so many gray-brownshinglecastles , fortresses towering in the shimmer of golden air , with turrets and ramparts , wards and sally ports , set there to defend the shore against the sea . I 'm not sure how the college 's several Faculty Row families with the means to afford seaside summer places came to choose Old Harbor Island . ( Though called an island , the rise of dunes and bluffs forms inp161fact a long hook that encloses the ancient village of Old Harbor 's fishing port , and its elevations become an islandonly when neap tides higher than usual temporarilymake one of them . ) A vaguely cultural atmosphere may have been the attraction . Since well before the Civil War a number of artists and writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the late nineteenth-century seriously called High Society , Old Harbor could by then afford you neighbors who might pass as Interesting People , not just newfoundmillionaires . For example , as you crossed over the short causeway provided against those periodic high tides to carry the road ( and later for a while the trolley line ) when I was a child , you saw first to your left on the piled-up rock point anchoring the sand bar , with its dunes and bluffs , the pink-stucco round-towered little chateau ' where a retired , once-famed Metropolitan Opera prima donna spent the summer . Her somewhat younger ( and surely last ) husband was a professional pianist . He still gave Carnegie Hall recitals and could be called well known , at least to music lovers . Cottage people might expect the privilege and pleasure of being invited from time to time to attend small soirees ' at which the singer , whose aging voice everyone agreed remained phenomenally beautiful , sang and her husband played . Another house on the rock point had for its owner no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person of cultivated tastes . He collected first editions . His wife , a swarthy , lanky woman , had local renown as female skipper of an eight-meter-class yacht named Folly IV that year by year took cups from all/male competition . Though the activity was not exactly cultural , the achievement was out of the ordinary . Who lived in each of the ocean-front houses which , the corner turned , successively crowned the bluff above the beach was well known to me as a boy , but now I forget . One , I remember , was occupied by an artist who might be thought of as carrying on the old tradition except that earlier painters and sketchers simply camped out on the dunes for their holiday . He worked in a most elaborate studio structure of old-world quaintness a little off from the house . It was the first artist 's studio I had ever seen , and I thought its Hansel-and-Gretel architectural detail delightful . Later I was to be informed that portraits he painted are poor imitations of those of John Singer Sargent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winslow Homer . I believe waspish critics even then dismissed him as a faker , a copying hack . The dismissal did n't matter much , because his wife was a woman of wealth . There was also , I recall , a playwright  --  of about the caliber , I should imagine , of Charles Rahn Kennedy  --  now forgotten , but then very successful , his dramas , as well as popular , being at the time regarded as distinguished . In his house summer people might meet visitingactors and actresses whose names were described as household words . As though to round the cultural circle , another of the bluff cottages was for years the summerhome of the editor of a respected monthly magazine . I remember him as a stout and stately man . He , of course , knew well many prominent writers of the day , so here you often met some of them . I suppose the three or four professors from our Faculty Row  --  like my father ,  |p163with  his Chaucerian studies , and then as the college 's president , succeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Interesting People category . So surely would Doctor Willem Van den Arend , the eminent archeologist and Egyptologist , whose house was next to ours . Bringing down from larger collections of his in Cambridge , where he lectured at Harvard , **25;9199;TOOLONG of the fruit of his expeditions , he created there a planless informal museum . In every room you saw casual unarranged scatterings of stone , bronze , pottery objects , often several thousand years old . I mentioned his wife , Eunice , in connection with my thinking about writing . ' She was a Cuthbertson second cousin of my mother 's . I can guess now that she and her husband , Villy ' ( he was of Dutch birth , but naturalized ) , may first have come to Old Harbor because of the relationship . This is , this was , Old Harbor Island . Haphazardly recalled , these are certain of the bluff cottages as I saw them when young and certain of the summer occupants of them . This was that beach below the bluff ; fine , broad , firm-sanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each cottage belonged to that cottage  --  always in appearance almost deserted except for the part in front of the Old Harbor Club , which , weekends , might be quite thickly dotted with guests of the club . On other parts you could expect to find a single swimmer , or a couple of them , or three or four ( rarely more ) who had come down one of the flights of wooden steps regularly set against the bluff every two or three hundred yards all the way up the beach . Nothing prevented the separatebathers from joining each other if they wished to ,  |p164and  sometimes those with adjacent bluff steps did swim or sit on the sand together , but general habit or custom was to stay below your own cottage . It meant no unfriendliness . Walking the length of the beach and back was a popular pastime , and the walkers would nod to , smile at , even pause to chat with anyone they happened to see down on the sand as they passed the successiveflights of steps , but gathering in groups would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your company had been requested at a driftwood-bonfireparty or a clambake . In my mind 's eye the stage is now set . Time : a late August midafternoon ; and : Enter YOUNG HANK . He makes his entrance by descending the wooden steps down from the Dodd House . He wears a bathing suit . He is deeply sun-tanned , causing his close-cut lightbrownhair to look startlingly blond . Our Hank is no longer the child able to gaze up and wonder at castles , sea keeps , on the sky-high bluff . The same shimmer of a fine afternoon 's bright beach haze veils the same scene , but he is now older than Elaine was when she walked that day on the dunes ( he will be sixteen next month ) , and through the shimmer he sees nothing but a longknownalignment of familiar houses on an elevation of only a hundred feet or so . As he starts down the steep steps our Hank quickly looks left , up the beach . I look where he looks . Near the foot of the next flight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is pleased to see the broad hemispheric arc of a big dark-blue beach umbrella , the shaft driven at an angle into the sand to tilt it against the afternoonp165sun . He and I know that Mrs. Van den Arend is down on the beach today . She seldom goes into the water , but she will have put on a bathing costume , always  --  inattentiveto such matters , our Hank never realizes it  --  of the season 's highest fashion . The Van den Arends ' Japaneseman , Taki , shortly after lunch has as usual brought down and opened up the big umbrella , adjusting it to cast a shade on the ample terry-cloth throw he spreads out . He unfolds a canvas back rest 's frame and cushion . Close to the back rest he places a wide low-footed table of teak . He sets on it a thermos jug of iced mineral water , a capacious silver basket filled with fresh fruit , a decorativebig round tin of French chocolates , a jade ashtray , and an oblong gold box containing cork-tipped cigarettes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest books still in their clean new dust jackets , the current numbers of several cultural or arty magazines , and a lap desk and Florentine-leather writing portfolio . Surely the sight of so complete a provision for private comfort and entertainment might have suggested to our Hank that Eunice Van den Arend comes down to the beach she may expect to find virtually empty well prepared to pass her afternoon alone , expecting no company and wishing none . Surely he might have hesitatedto assume with the assurance he has shown all summerthat before or after he went swimming Mrs. Van den Arend would be pleased to have him sit with her for a while . It is mortifying to me to be unable to rememberyoung Hank ever being called or waved to , invited to join her . He simply , with adolescent gall so much more characteristic of most young males than an adolescent shyness or sensitiveness sometimes creditedp166to them , in all easy familiarity presents himself , and I can find no comfort but the dubious one that if his attendanceis never invited , it is also never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which our Hank had n't then the perception to appreciate , whether in a resigned putting up with tiresome presumptions of a child of friends and neighbors ( and distant relative ) , the lady greets him with a smile that looks like welcome . She offers him the fruit and the chocolates and sometimes , to his flattered gratification , a cigarette , possibly with the thought that these are what he comes for and given them he may soon go away and spare her further hearing/of what he has to say . If that is her hope it is vain , because , while he gladly accepts the offerings , he comes not for them but for that hearing of what he has to say . His glances of greed go not to fruit , candy , or even cigarettes -- though smoking , being forbidden at his preparatory school , he finds pleasurable if not in fact enjoyable  --  but to those new books , those advanced magazines piled around her . He wishes to talk of them , and by his talk to impress her with what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his literary taste and cultural acumen . In short , he comes to show off . Later reflection suggests to me that , while our Hank may not have realized the fact , the impulse or urge to show off had been greatly strengthened this summer by a sudden discovery  --  by a seeing of it for the first time , and then by repeated fresh awarenesses of it  --  that Eunice Van den Arend was a very attractive woman . The new view of her which , a little comically , his ingenuousnessmakes him find startling , is subject at oncep167to all the vagaries of that divided juvenile mind where thinking or fancying remains one thing and acting or intending to act another . At fifteen I had none of the uncertainty Elaine reportsherself as having at fourteen about the thing that men and women did together , but my handling of what I knew , being subject to the dichotomy of mind whose practice left unconstrained certain lines of thought while straitly constraining certain other lines in reason integral to them , was odd indeed . Knowledge got at second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could not help being in large part unrealistic , but it went far enough to leave our Hank in no doubt about the basic facts . One of them was that all females , their nakedness , as the Bible put it , uncovered , were the same ; and this must be as much the case with a Mrs. Van den Arend as with girls his own age , toward a few of whom he has before now nerved himself to make such awkward advances as a short hug , a hasty kiss . Under their skirts he knows they are the same , yes ; but his mind is still unable to take with a Mrs. Van den Arend such liberties of fancy as he might not hesitate to take with a hugged and kissed girl . Merely by being an adult  --  even , in his eyes , quite old ; not less than thirty  --  and a married woman who with her husband has long ( he would have said always ) lived as friend and neighborof his parents in their world apart of grownups to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be identifiedwith , or at least seen as belonging to , the generationof his pastors and masters . All these have been tirelessin teaching him that the thoughts his fairly new knowledge of the commerce of the sexes might occasionp168were to be characterized as Impure and Nasty  --  religiously , evil ; socially , vulgar . While by no means meaningthat such thoughts about a woman so identified could not from time to time enter his head , it did mean there would be something rather scaring in their entrance . Ill ease and even discomfort unfailingly attend them , and young Hank is pressed to cut them short , put them away ; or , if notwithstanding they persist in his mind , to impersonalize them , to make them a dream of fair women in general and their bodies , not centeringspecifically on any one given one . I watch our Hank come confidently across the stretch of sand and I can see , as he nears Mrs. Van den Arend , that today he is again noticing with that ingenuously startled fresh awareness that she is very good-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair up in a gold satin kerchief . Under her neat dark eyebrows her dark clear eyes have what seems almost a violet tone . Her unmadeupface ( once in awhile she does go swimming ) approximatesin its natural coloring that so-called **26;9226;TOOLONG . Curves of cheek and , below her full-lipped pretty mouth , of chin are cleanly cut . She is wearing a bathing suit he has not seen before , another of those creations ' in the high fashion ( he does not know it ) of that season . In color it matches the gold kerchief on her head . The cut is what was then regarded as daring . It closely fits her breasts . It is skintight across her narrow buttocks . Its abbreviated token of skirt is hardly as long as its short tights . On her shapely feet are golden beach slippers . Ignorant of high fashion our Hank may be , and he isp169so far unpracticed in uses of gallantry , indeed so innocentof purposes of gallantry , that it will never occur to him to compliment the lady on her appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' features . As his habit is , he settles himself prone on the sand just beyond the edge of the terry-cloth throw and looking toward Mrs. Van den Arend from this angle he finds himself shown ampler areas of female thigh , more nakedness ' than he has ever seen uncovered before . Hastily he averts his eyes . He affects the liveliest interest in examininga number of new books she pushes , smiling , over to him . One is by D. H. Lawrence , who had come at that time to be culturally and intellectually the literary ( so vital ; so untrammeled ) last word . Our Hank does not delay to make knowledgeable talk . He speaks of an earlier work of Lawrence 's called Sons and Lovers , given him by an aesthetically inclined master at school that spring to read . Meanwhile those thoughts rather scaring hover near , maneuvering to invade his mind . They gain entry presently ; they possess it ; and under cover of furthercritical comment on writing and writers he gives his head a casual turn that lets his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he leaves off his looking to take up another of the books , to make more literary talk while he watches for a chance to , unobserved , look , look again . In the course of this watching for them our Hank must before long notice that the chances seem in a slightly disturbing way to be as good and as many as he could possibly wish . Where he anticipated difficulties and planned exercises of craft and caution all is proving easy  --  even , his wary sense of guilt may half suspect , overeasy . Craft 's cover of talk about the avant-gardep170herself in it . She picks up the gold cigarette box . She says : " Bring the books . Taki can come down for the rest . " At the top of the steep wooden steps extends in front of the house a terrace of grass , a lawn kept poor by the salt air . It is hedged with roses of rugosa strains  --  the only kind that can be grown so near the sea . They pass across the deep verandah to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First fruits of expeditions the Doctorused earlier to lead are to be seen . Close to the ceiling , running all around the wall , a red stone or clay frieze full of acrobatic boys and curiously formed cavortingbulls is affixed . By living-room and dining-room doors mummy cases , with the person they once containedpictured dimly on their ancient covers , stand guard . At the back of the hall hang irregular slabs , broken tablets that bear lines of incised marks worn by time  --  proto-Indic seal hieroglyphics , Easter Island stencilcharacters , Sinaitic script  --  of still-undeciphered extinct languages , which are Doctor Van den Arend 's special interest and study . To our Hank , Mrs. Van den Arend says : " Wait . " Mounting the stairs she passes a series of bronzeboundsections of Sicilian tesserae displaying warriors in combat , hunters hunting , fowlers netting birds , dancers and musicians . Left alone , Hank waits . The house is silent . The Doctor , he knows , is this week away , perhaps lecturing somewhere , perhaps attendinga learned society 's convention . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think a moment of Villy , ' a big man with bright-blue eyes , a wide brown beard , and an agreeable trace of Dutch accent ,  |p173and  to picture how he and the relatively slight Mrs. Van den Arend , for the purpose entirely uncovered , might look while in marital embrace . The picture , the thought , is of that scaring kind . Scaring , too , is a tentativesmall stir of his own senses . Agitated , he pulls his mind away . What can be taking Mrs. Van den Arend so long ? As if in response , he hears her call : " Hank . Come up , will you ? " Gaining the head of the stairs he sees through an open door in the upper hall that she is standing near the dressing table in a large bedroom . She says : " Come in . Close the door . " Perplexed , our Hank does as he is told . She gives him a warm smile . Her dark eyes tranquil , her tone detached , as casual as if she offered him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hank , would you like to have me ? " The blue terry-cloth robe still wraps Mrs. Van den Arend around , but she has removed the kerchief from her head , letting down her dark hair . Kerchief and bathing suit both lie on a blanket chest at the foot of the bed . On stage now we are to have relishable comedy , albeitlow . The generous offer , altogether unforeseen , may startle our Hank but surely it ca n't but delight him , too . Could he ask or hope for anything more ? Consider his employment on the beach this afternoon , his secret looks , his thoughts , if awkwardly impersonalized , still not any the less lecherous . Downstairs a mere few minutes ago there had been , however quickly put away , thatp174instant of not impersonalized thinking in which he picturedthe big Doctor and his spouse as he proceeded to have ' her . Can he be called clean-minded ? Does he exhibitconcern to be chaste ? Has he the strength of ten because his heart is pure ? Plainly no ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance of the thinking and picturingbeing always all thought , actless . That it might ever be allowed him to see more than he covertly peeps at on the beach , that he might ever himself do the office his mind had the Doctor doing , remains inconceivable , sheer impossibility . This is dream stuff , stuff of reverie ; and in unsurprising ( if now ironic ) truth , among our boy dreamer 's uses of reverie is one that brings about in his mind , causes to take place there , the very thing that has just happened . Lost in imaginings , the fact that you know in real life it would n't , could n't ever , happen need not stop you from creating a girl who , with exactly Mrs. Van den Arend 's warm smile , calls you into a bedroom where you are given , how intoxicatingly , to understand that here she is , ready and willing right now to be taken by you and enjoyed . In reverie , to understand is ardently to act . Maybe the dream girl is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undresses . Both stark naked , to what eager kissings , what liberties of fondling , with voluptuous embracings they lie down together  --  and then , oh then , oh then ! On stage before me I see things going differently . Stopped in his tracks , our Hank stands altogether dumbfounded . What was said could hardly have been clearer or simpler , but hearing it said is so unthinkable to him that in literalness he does n't believe his ears . How canp175anything right out of reverie come down to earth in a real bedroom 's warm shadow of real August afternoon and survive the light of common day ? The living person he looks at could n't have spoken those words , and simplycould n't mean what the dream girl would be meaning . Yet he did , he knows he did , hear the question . Looking at her he sees she must have asked it ; she smiles still , and he must answer . Our Hank 's one answer of truth , the moment 's only one , would have to be : No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't . No , I 've got to go . . . . It is not given . All speech fails him . That her young friend 's first reaction could be of this kind must surely have occurred to Mrs. Van den Arend in her weighings and ponderings down on the beach . She shows herself prepared . Of cardinal importance now is taking care that those lost powers of speech are n't soon enough regained to let instinct 's frightened refusal be uttered and , so , confirmed in him , and best means to this end may be an immediate compounding of shock . Twitching her shoulders she shrugs off the blue robe , opening to him the full apocalypse  --  all the horsemen at once  --  of a nakedness the bathing suit on the blanket chest rightly indicated her robe alone covered . The move is masterly . Her young friend is still more powerlessto speak ; he is still less able to flee . As though made stock or stone our mute Hank stares confounded , gapes hypnotized . Dwelt on in imaginationa fair white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with yearning excitement . Seen in fact , this one freezes him with near-revulsion . He almost recoils . Whatever erotic imagination with no other material available , with nothing more to go on than art , ' thanp176the nude women who loll and languish in famous paintings , had its dream girls looking like when reverie finishedundressing them , they never looked like this . How close to horrifying the mused-on Bower of Bliss 's actuality ! How wide , how dense the spread bosket of its fur of dark thick hair bottoming the ( fair , white ) belly ! Now that Mrs. Van den Arend , invitation smiled warmly , has gone to the bed and there laid herself down on her back he sees it brought by receptive separation of legs to part a little and to half reveal what could be the narrow fearful slit of an unsutured wound . Masterly though they are , her means to secure him , to induce the state of shock preventing flight , have a drawback that may imperil the whole project . Her turningat once to recline on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that naive revulsion . She correctlydivines the good chance that any move toward him , any touching of him , might in his stunned state panic him . This has been avoided , but alas initiative has to be relinquished , delivered over . Is her young friend able to take it ? Has she allowed enough for the force of still-childish fear and ignorance ? Has she banked too far on the urgence of a mature male in symptoms of appetite she detected ? ( Down on the beach he was not for a moment unobserved . Of course she saw where his eyes kept going and marked signs of his concealed excitement . That would be how she came to form her suddenidea of trying if he could not be made to serve a purpose . ) Once invitingly lain down , she needs no more than an instant to recognize that , other possible miscalculationsp177quite aside , her postured invitation is one our Hank can not accept , first of all because he can not move . Resourceful , she arises with swiftness . Taking the calculatedrisk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands there . Good ; she can risk more . Careful to avoid all that might suggest a caress , her motionsgentle , calm , but firm , as though she had a child to help , she loosens the belt of his swimming trunks and draws the sleeveless jersey over his head . Dropping it , she then pushes down to his ankles , making him step out of them , the trunks . In fresh and in some ways still-more-intense dismay at seeing himself stripped as bare as she is  --  to what he has been taught is the turpitude of looking at women with no clothes on he now adds that of , with no clothes on , letting a woman look at him  --  shyness dizzies our Hank . Faint in consternation he can only close his eyes . He allows himself to be led blind to the bed , incapable of imagining , not wanting to know , not even daring to think : what next ? Brought to sit beside her on the bed 's edge he is hoping for some safety in this practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , what next takes his weak breath away . An unhesitating hand has gone direct to his unmanned state , exploring and investigatingit , trying what may be done about it . For a shattering second or two this ultimate in personaloutrage , this extremity of privacy 's violation , seems to be beyond all bearing ; yet shame 's impulse to push the hand away is checked . A fending-off must serve to confirm the violation , to prove the hand is there . Frustrate , our Hank rests held against her by her leftp178arm around him . Conscious of the resilient left breast brought by the encircling arm to press against his shoulderhe can only squeeze his eyes tighter shut , pretending he is somewhere else , while after a moment , incredulous , he begins to feel , in a relaxing of his nerves , in an easing of his sense of the fantastic and the fearful , desire'sinchoate risings . These ministrations he is being submitted to are , after all , no unknown thing . In the dark provided by his shut eyes he waits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiarrespondings . The respite of the familiar is short , for Mrs. Van den Arend ca n't but know , once she sees the attained success of her endeavor , that if she is to turn it to account she would be unwise to waste a minute . With no warning our Hank undergoes the sudden cling of both clasping arms that draws him down on the bed , a seizure by force whose new ministration is to pull that functional nakednessof his over upon hers while her bare knees lock quickly about him , completing the entrapment . At once and willy-nilly he is brought to encounter the point of startling , easy give-in , to feel , aghast and with pounding heart , the soft ingress open like a mire of quicksand , drawing him down as far as he can go , and there , past hope of rescue , closing securely on him . Gripped this way , in clamp of connection held helpless , he is spun by a vertigo almost of anguish , of queasy revulsion and aching pleasure intolerably antagonizing together , through some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , pulls from him in shudderings of gratification and nausea mixed his weak incontinent spasm . When hardly started ,  |p179oh  then , oh then , oh then is over and done . The shortlivedlittle comedy concludes . Or does it ? I will be seen to have ventured , feeling there might be some bearing on years-later thoughts of mine about Elaine 's recounted adventure , to present an acted-out scene where memory shows me in my **30;9254;TOOLONG part . I have been at pains to make factual detail exact . I look on it as a fair sample of that variety of small out-of-the-way human experienceone sort or another of which I think few youths escapesometimes having . Our Hank here experiences the expense of spirit in a waste of shame ? The grown man may say , nonsense ; but in unaltered utter bewilderment , in bafflement still total , our Hank 's young mind must treat the episode as that , as an event momentous and appalling  --  maybe the Sin against the Holy Ghost . His turn of thought can find in stuff of bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unheard-of , the horrible . As Elaine remarks , traumata of the sort will usuallyprove in the long run to be only flesh wounds , and the frightened confusion is continuing comedy , yet sometimes , as in this case , I think , confusion ca n't be laughed off as unreasoned . Reasonably one may very well ask : What in God 's name goes on here ? How often is it to be expected that married women of good station will elect suddenly to strip themselves before a neighbor 's child and , more than let him , resolutely compel him to do it ' with them ? In plain and certain fact the lady 's conduct is **26;9286;TOOLONG , fantastically out of the way , most extraordinarily odd . Until Mrs. Van den Arend 's youngp180friend comes to know any number of things now unknown to him he ca n't so much as start to reason the episodeout , to grasp possibilities that might explain it . What things unknown ? Some are of a general sort , lacked knowledge of curiosities in human behavior , of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so acting . Right here our Hank is seen not to know enough about women and their ways . A dream girl his mind created might do as Mrs. Van den Arend has done , but his knowledge of real females , all that in outward appearance he knows them to be , all that he has observed them to do and say , persuades him that the dream girl 's lewdly imagined ardors real females never feel . ( Pope 's contention that every woman is at heart a rake the fifteen-year-old finds misleading . ) In such matters they are pure and neuter , chastely disinterested . To gross male demands , he is given to suppose , they accede , if they do , with nothing other than patience and resignation . As a result he can not see , he is not even in a case to conceive of , one of the easier explanations . He simply does not know that , their accustomed bedfellows absent , in some women unmet physical needs will mount up until they are so distracting that pitiful expedients like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like bringing some scared neophyte to fumble with her are resorted to as better than nothing . If our Hank can not conceive of a woman thus distracted , how much less able will he be to conceive of one to whom the scared neophyte is not better than nothing but better than anything , to whom pleasure 's acme comes in thinking about , and in watchingherself engineer , the impairment of a minor 's mor/als , in the unnerved , unable , blushing boy 's loss of his virginity by her contrivance . However , the watcher of the play , I , the grown man , to whom neither possibility will seem in the least impossiblemust judge both to be improbable . A difficultyis in the way of both . Can I believe the sexually famished woman to whom our Hank might be better than nothing or the aberrational raper of boy-children to whom he might be better than anything would be able , either of them , to proceed as we see Mrs. Van den Arend proceeding ? Could either keep so cool a head in throes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would she be apt to act , calm and collected , the perceptive preceptor , determining with judgment what measures are best calculated to enable her dazed young friend to do what she appears to have decided to have him do ? In this appearance , in the introduced concept of the taken decision I , the adult watcher , see one possibility that is not at all wanting in probability . Again our Hank is handicapped by what he does not know , and this time the lacked knowledge is specific , not general . What does he know about the Van den Arends ? He knows they are his parents ' summer neighbors and live in a house full of archeological treasures . He knows that the Doctor is a big , bearded , blue-eyed man with a slight Dutch accent . He knows the Doctor 's wife , his mother 's distant cousin and practically old enough to be his mother , is a woman of physical charm ( though he only recently realized that ) who sits amiably on a beach discussing arts and letters with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ( it would never be spoken of inp182his hearing ) and what he will later learn  --  that , as well as a distinguished archeologist , Villy is a notorious and quite open philanderer , and , moreover , by all accounts , that prodigy , that rare sexual athlete , who can take care of women to nearly any ( mine e tre ? ) number . Our Hank does not know  --  we are back to general ignorance  --  that this kind of capacity , of Priapic potential , will always emanate in ways no female whose appetite it may concern ever misses , and so those who possess it seldom want for women to take care of . Now let us again pass in review the Afternoon of Mrs. Van den Arend . On the beach her young visitor finds her strangely preoccupied and in a way even he can feel is somber . What is on her mind ? Might she not be digestingintelligence perhaps come by morning mail that the Doctor is up to his accustomed tricks ? A friend ( or maybe enemy ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at wherever this convention was , had been seen barefacedly combining business of scholarly papers and conferences with pleasure of a woman or women in his hotel rooms . By now such news must in one sense be no news . The girl-bride Eunice could not , married to a prodigy of nature , be long in grasping the truth about him . No matter how fully and frequently he was being accommodated by her , the true sexual athlete could be left with energies to spare . At some early point ( it doubtless was a profound shock then ) she perhaps learned this by surprising him , by unexpected chance finding him , though he had been having her in their room only a little while before , having another woman in another room . Amazed and incensed she might naturally attempt ap183laying-down of ordinary law . If he could not be true to her she would deny him her person ; she would leave him ; she would divorce him . Threats , idle threats ! She is going to do none of these things , because here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which our Hank does not , can not , know about , and by which even those who are older and wiser may sometimesbe confounded . That the law she would lay down is unenforced , that she remains Mrs. Van den Arend , may and does speak for itself . The emanated Priapic something-or-other that presumably worked on whateverwoman she might have surprised Villy with ( and on who knew how many besides ) clearly works also on her . It arrests those first angry resolves ; it whispers : Not so fast ! This dilemma of passion is one I have observed to be peculiarly a woman 's , seldom posing itself to a man  --  possibly because for him in the dark all cats will be more or less gray , while for her a good man in this meaning is hard to find . At any rate , the fact does keep speaking . Villy had had , was having , and would go on having , others . Never for one instant reconciled , each time tasting gall of no recourse as bitter as ever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrates that it can overwhelm all enmity of anger , all smarts of hurt pride , all weak recoilings of fastidiousness . Villy may need only to look at her and , reduced , she is ready once more to lump everything she does n't like . The unreconciled resentment can very nicely account for the brooding on the beach , the inward-lookingabsorption , the seeming inattention that was to em/bolden her young friend in his covert study of thighs . The womanly slow burn , the smolder of anger , could well explain the turn her mind might take when she notices those glances he imagined are unobserved and sees in a flash ways and means for resentment to act instead of smoldering impotent . She ca n't police the waywardVilly 's hotel rooms , but what is to stop her from trying whether this boy 's furtive lustful interest in her body can not serve anger 's purpose of getting even , cannotbe used this very afternoon to put a thing within the thing where Villy 's thing ought to be ? Except for his maleness , which gives him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make the thing functional , our Hank can evidently be nothing at all to her . Her feelings are almost antithetical to those of physical desire . She has not the slightest wish for or expectation of sexual satisfaction . Vengeful , she is undertaking what amounts to a tactical exercise of calculated maneuver to answer at least in token form adultery with adultery . The taken decision is angry impulse 's , but the head , not the heart , will see to implementingit . Resentment , given release of action , becomesof the sort that will clear and cool , rather than heat , the head . Coolly considered , her sudden idea of using her young friend for resentment 's purpose ( supposing she finds him usable ) could seem to have much to be said for it . She may expect him to be more readily manageablethan a grown man . If she succeeds in enticing him into connection there can be little  --  really , no  --  chance of his not keeping quiet about it . Without question he will have been brought up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He will not dare tell his parents , and if he lets anyone else know it will be only close school friends , youths of his own age he might hope to impress with the claim of having had a woman . Our Hank 's entire ingenuousness can be of even furtherservice . His guarded glances indicated unmistakablestirring of desire , but the cautiousness with which he ventured them told you that what desire desires he himself all the while fears . Such fear was very good evidence that he had never before gone beyond ordinary adolescent masturbation fantasies , which he would have been taught to be both ashamed of and worried about . So conditioned , the boy brought for the first time to attempt the man 's work is as good as bound to botch it badly . A bad botching might be counted on to have still other desirable effects . Since he was male , proof of how little a man he was would be likely to seem to him a crushing shame , a disgrace forever . Appetite to have her again would hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for further favors which , her little symbolic getting-even with Villy accomplished , she would n't be intending to afford him . The awful humiliation experiencedseems certain for a time at least to set him shrinking from the very thought of encounter with a woman . Before that time can pass , summer will be over and he will be back at school . The plan is practical . There is no real present risk and the boy promises to be no problem later . Our Hank lies where we left him . His poor work done , he rests inanimate , his friend softly cradling andp186supporting his spent state . Leaving what seems to have been some hiatus of unthinking , his mind now slowly stirs . That everyday consciousness , that sense of ordinaryreality lost when as by a magician 's gesture the terry-cloth robe is twitched off and hey , presto ! he looks in the afternoon shadows on Mrs .. Van den Arend 's state of nature , now returns . He sees afternoon shadows still the same . He sees Mrs. Van den Arend 's perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elaine spoke of this surprise of no change when she watched her mother going out to dinner . ) Calm and clear , the same grave smile seems kindly , convincingly to say that nothing mysterious , nothing shocking , nothing at all , has happened . Bringing her hand to his head , she draws his face to hers and kisses his mouth . With a new jar of surprise our Hank now realizes that to start there had been none of the kissing , none of the love-making ' you might expect . He can not know the kiss is thanks . He can not know she thanks him for surcease , for an easing of her female nature 's earlier smart of anger . ( She does not need to have Villy know he is paid back . It is enough that privately , hugging it to herself , she knows . ) Gently she releases him . She rises . She takes the terryclothrobe and wraps herself in it . She says : " Do n't be afraid , Hank . No one will ever find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cambridge . That 's our good-by bless you ! " Yes ; bless you ! Our afternoon-of-Mrs. - Van- den- Arend revels now are ended.  |p187T0  IMPRISONED Claudio , the Duke , unrecognized in his guise of friar , pronounces : Reason thus with life : if I do lose thee , I do lose a thing that none but fools would keep . . . . The lugubrious long ticking-off of life 's tribulations and glooms , its miseries and futilities , seems for a moment to have turned the trick . Made absolute for death , Claudiowill humbly thank him ; but also , not much later , Claudio will still try to dodge when told of a chance . He will drive his chaste sister to cry : Oh , fie , fie , fie ! He sues to live ; he is ready to accept the weariest and most loathed worldly life that age , ache , penury , and imprisonmentcan lay on nature . I have crossed over the road and entered the old Woodfield Center burying ground . I , too , reason with life . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buried here , be anything but easeful ? Here might be found soft names for death . I walk out of heat of July sun into refreshment of coolness , into quiet as of en/chantment . Big maples grow around and between the long rows of old headstones . The leafy green unbroken shade speaks peace , all perfect peace . I am bemused with thoughts of takings into the air of quiet breath , of ceasing upon midnights with no pain ; of tranquil slippingsdown to that calm endless sabbath of the tomb . Moreover these sleepers below ground will now rest everlastingly undisturbed . The cemetery plot measures perhaps two acres . It is full , complete . Not the space for a single grave is empty . No more diggers ' thud of pick and scrape of shovel . No more stirrings and murmursof thronging mourners . No fresh intruders loweredto lie with you . Nothing will be henceforth heard but the infrequent footfall on the grass overhead of a chance visitor . Idling along he examines the old stones , with their cinerary urns , weeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates . He scans with a smile subjoined consolatory sentiments , pieties of artlessverse ( Yes ; as you are now so once was he ; as he is now so will you be ) . Archaic language 's quaint mournfulnumbers sound a pleasing melancholy , a pensive regret . How comfortable the idea of being no more , of breathing one 's last , of coming to dust . How sweet the silence of the final home . How good the long account 's forever and ever amen . This graveyard is familiar to me . I knew it as a child , and later I was to inherit through my father , on my parents ' untimely death , the property across the road I have just crossed , the eighteenth-century inn and tavern I mentioned when I spoke of failures of the prophetic voice . I knew Woodfield Center as a child because it was where the Pierces came from , and my father 's mother ,  |p189widow  of Professor Abdiel Worthington , was living in another of the original eighteenth-century structures , a handsome house of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to the church on the Woodfield Center green . The college is barely ten miles away , and my father , one of the first Faculty Row people to acquirean automobile ( a Stanley Steamer ) , in spring and fall drove us up , I think it was every other Sunday , for dinner . I still remember the dinners as marvelously bountiful and , to my mind , very good . My grandmother , I realize now , was one of the many widows who , when comfortably able to afford it , compensate themselves for their bereft state and for growing old by heavy eatinga real living to eat ; all serious interest in life centering around enormous elaborate meals . When dinner was over , to settle ' it ( a notion of the day ) we often walked on the green and through the graveyard . Among the more ancient stones a number stand over forebears of mine in the Pierce line , and there are in addition Phippses , Mooars ( odd obsolete spelling ) , Bannisters , related by being husbands of Pierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from whom connections of cousins more and more remote descend . The graves of those whose blood might be supposed to be in me were pointed out , and things about some of them ( if anything was known , and possiblyeven if it was n't ) would be repeated to me . Regarded most reverently was the grave of Elnathan Pierce . His stone , which this July noon I now come to stand looking at , bears interestingly a near-obliterated fine-cut grinning skull and worn Latin epitaph . Elnathanwas a minister and in a log house on the greenp190he kept an academy , ' the first school in this part of the state . His academy ' was the corporate entity moved down to become in time the college , the corpus of the bequest maintaining the school being assigned by the General Court to another minister , the Reverend William Greene , by the college honored as its founder since he gave broader construction to terms of the bequest ( which only proposed to teach children reading and writing ) and made free to develop a small institutionproviding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Reverend Elnathan beneath the skullmarkedstone had been , I was informed , my **28;9314;TOOLONG  --  thatis , my father 's mother ( of the good dinners ) was Charity Pierce , daughter of the ReverendLevi Pierce , Elnathan 's grandson . In effect , I was to remember that as long ago as that my ancestors were people of worth ( if not wealth ) and learning , and I must always be mindful of solemn obligations thus laid on me . I have since reflected that the Reverend Elnathan can have been but one of sixteen men , his approximate contemporaries , from whom I descend , each just as much an ancestor ' as he is . And what of them ? Who on earth were they ? Into the graveyard today I bring a sorely troubled mind . I seek to give it some distraction by moving on , trying to find other graves I well remember . Here lies little Geraint Phipps . The stone is of the size , about two feet high and ten inches wide , thought suitable in earlier times for young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plots speaks grimly of those times ' child-mortalityrate . The stone I look down at bears only namep191and dates : Born 21st December 1861 . Died 15th April 1865 . What , at first glance , is different or notable about this stone ? Someone  --  my father , no doubt  --  once happened to comment on it to me . What day was that April day of death ? The name Geraint tells you  --  what ? The name , I learned , tells you that in these remote rude hills , where not a few men still made their mark on papers that had to be read to them , a cultured young Mrs. Phipps most certainly beguiled a pregnancy with verses of Alfred ( not yet Lord ) Tennyson only a little while after their English publication . That day in April is also the day of President Lincoln 's death . I do n't understand why , I only know that these items of incidental intelligence had on my youthful mind a memorable effect . They worked , like sudden revelation , to give me a first startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living , not merely a page in a book . My mind would henceforth find itself able ( at moments ) to compass a survey of how things happened , how things were , a sort of inspired viewing of many picturable events at once as one whole . Here beside the Woodfield Center green or in a farmhouse up a township lane you looked on the expiring of Geraint Phipps , three and a half , on a fifteenth of April , victim of some childhood complaint perhaps nowadays never fatal . In a room in a house across the street from the Washington theater on this identical April fifteenth you may see A. Lincoln ( 0 heart ! heart ! heart ! 0 the bleeding drops of red . . . ) expiring of his mortal head wound . By the presidential deathbed early in the morning the attendingsurgeons stand and listen to last gasps of CheyneStokesbreathing . Like the rest of the overmany dis/tinguished spectators who press to be present , like the tear-dropping ladies in the next room , they are of no help at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true of those attending little Geraint . A by-courtesydoctor shakes his rustic 's head . Nothing from the vials his small physic box contained has done any good . Little-boy Geraint also breathes his last . During followingdays , while machinery of declared national mourningspreads organized grief countrywide , up here under the grand pall 's outside edge the tacked-up miles of crepe swags and the incessant muffled drumming could have passed hardly noticed . A few family friends and relatives gather to bury a child , apple , for all one can tell , of his verse-reading mother 's eye . Protracted meditations on child Geraint ( Turn , Fortune , turn thy wheel . . . ) and on the miniature headstoneand on onetime thoughts of mine about it or derivedfrom it are of service to our loitering Hank , here become old Hank . He uses them to hold his mind in the burying ground . He does not want it to go back across the road to that eighteenth-century former tavernwhose restoring and remodeling occupied a young Hank and his young wife , Judith , for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its rooms that Elaine came to be conceived . ) The inn , though early custom was anything but nautical , being for the most part itinerant pedlars with their pack wagons and droverspassing through with their herds , and though the sea lies far away , had been named The Whale . This was explained by the fact that for reasons unknown and by means only guessed at a blue whale 's mammoth jaw/bones had been caused to be conveyed to Woodfield . ( One story is that local ox teams hired for the train bringing Fort Ticonderoga cannon to Boston returned carrying them . ) Attached upright by iron links to a great boulder , they stood impressively for near a centuryon the strip of greensward outside the pot-room door . They were carted off ( to where I ca n't imagine ) when by the 188o 's pedlars and drovers stopped passing through in any numbers and the tavern shut up for want of trade . Now in front of the soundly restored , sprucely kept ancient structure hangs from a tall post a neat bright painted sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE WHALE . Below them , a fine spiritedwhale is pictured spouting and flaunting his tail . Slim black swash lettering at the bottom says : Antiques . Judith Conway . Hooked under the sign is a small detachableboard : CLOSED TODAY . Not far off on a graveled area shaded by more big maples the shining car in which Elaine and her father drove here is seen parked . Next to it is the more modest car of a local physician . He is upstairs with Judith and a practical nurse who attends her . Downstairs Elaine waits in the spacious well-appointed shop . She sits or walks about smoking her cigarettes among her mother 's distinguished pieces of eighteenth-century furniture , old paintings , old porcelain services , and quantities of old silver , all authentic , all of price , displayed for sale . The physician , when he has done what he deems advisable and instructedthe nurse , will come down and tell Elaine what he thinks , and she will tell Father . But our old Hank already knows for certain all thatp194can be told . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is entrapped , closed in on , brought under decimating fire . In the remnant force of his fellow troopers now another falls , and now another . I am grown familiar with dyings . I am practiced in seeing to funeral and burial arrangements . I know what to say to the parson and how to instruct the undertaker . Yes ; let 's choose executors and talk of wills ! I can enter into proceedings of probate with confidence ; I am wise in the ways of collecting insurance promptly and settling estates with only normal delay . My experience also makes possible a kind of composure . I am easy , as I would not once have been , in the presence of persons about to die . By now I have learned to support those quite inconscionablylong , long drawn-out dyings that modern medical science , by its miracles , can afford the moribund . I have visited the cardiac patient , dropsical , growinggaunter and ghastlier . I recognize that saturating with cologne of a room 's air prescribed to mask taints of decay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing . ( I would find it now upstairs in The Whale , I feel sure ; but , so what ? ) I have also looked at a few less common sights , such as the blownoutbrains and the blood on the floor . When the doctor goes , Elaine will talk to Judith . Father is here , too . Does her mother want to see him ? I confess I hope she will not want to see him ; but , as I say , if needs must , this dint of seeing I can nowadays face up to . And of course here Father 's composure amounts to no special feat . Time 's work is done . Harrowing recurrence of any parts or part of the young **37;9344;TOOLONG need n't be feared . All that came to an end much before he agreed to the divorce Judith wanted . It was so fully finished that the agreed-to divorce could be rancorless , without grudge-bearing . While there was no let's-be-friends in the agreement , there was no enmityof the kind that arises most often from incensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to a certain involvement of mine during those militaryserviceyears Elaine mentioned , Judith 's sudden asking for a divorce could come as a considerable relief , as a solving of a problem , not serious , but persistently troublingto me , which I had not seen how to solve ; while my making no difficulty about the divorce she could see , at that moment , as a favor to her . Complementary generous feelings result . Judith , for example , offers to return to me the title to this **27;9383;TOOLONG . ( It was not then a shop . It was rented to and lived in by a couple of the college 's instructorsand their wives . ) I had put the place in her name soon after I came by it and we decided to restore it . Judith declares herself ready to recognize the deeding over to her as no more than form , a prudent financial or fiscal measure in which was implicit the assumption that our relationship was permanent , hers to be mine and mine to be hers as long as we lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I ought to have it . In the same mood I will not hear of such a thing . She holds the title , owns it . It is hers . Indeed , I remember my mood of good-tempered good will reached far enough for me to feel a disinterested concern about Judith 's course of action , an apprehensivenesson her behalf . Her reason for wanting a divorce  --  she candidly said so  --  was her having convinced herself that , were she free , ' one of her lovers of the moment  --  andI think he may have been for some time the only one she was sleeping with  --  would instantly marry her . He was a man of great wealth ( I do not say it cynically , but this perhaps played a part in shaping Judith 's mood ) and an important backer or director of several large firms at one time or another using our services . He was not in any sense a personal friend of mine , but sessions of consultation gave me chances to see something of him , to size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal about how men in his position , men of authority in large affairs , men with the power of money , may be expected to think and act . That he would do as Judith hoped struck me as highly improbable . In conference discussions with him I had been impressed by his sharp eye for the practical , his unfailing farsightedness . I judged that he could be counted on to take wise care of his own real interests , arranging to have what he wanted on terms always favorable to him , with no irksome obligations assumed or unnecessary commitments entered into . I did not feel able to venture the impertinence of giving Judith my opinion in so personal an affair of hers ; and also I had to remember that in my time I had known or heard about more than one man of just this type turned all of a sudden quite berserk , losing when seized of sexual passion every trace of the judgment you had seemed able to count on and determinedly behaving with foolishness almost unbelievable . It might be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had him in some manner bewitched , but I could not down my dis/turbed feeling that the one bewitched was she ; and indeedthe event was to find Judith 's man doing nothing foolish . Judith had been altogether mistaken about his intentions . When she returned from Reno he took steps evidently effective , and so probably brutal , to rid himselfof her , to see her no more . My mild concern for Judith was only that . I could wish her project well and even regret the distress she must have suffered when it fell through , but these were impersonal feelings . As I 've said , we were n't , divorced ( at the time it was quite modish ) , still being friends , ' remaining on close terms . After she left me to go to Reno I never saw Judith face to face again . Simply , if I thought seldom of her and she thought seldom of me , when the thoughts came to us they were , I know on my part and I think on hers , unresentful , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and liked by Judith , she wrote with a show of warmth to wish us happiness . Such letters may , of course , be written with hostile intent  --  a bitter wish to assert , to have me know , that she could n't possibly care less if I took a second wife , and if I imagine she was being given a jolt , why see how wrong I am  --  but I believe Judith was truly able to mean what she said and nothing else . For my part , a year or so after she opened her antique business in The Whale I was very willing to give her gratis a little of that costly counseling my associates and I provide . She sent the shop books down to me by Elaine , who had gone to stay with her mother for a while after she left Wilfred . Elaine 's grasp of business principles , if intermittent , can be surprisingly good , and she seems to have made the suggestion  --  represent/ing that I would n't mind a bit , and the chances were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital investmentand with trade reasonably brisk , the shop barely broke even . On its petty scale , this presents the sort of problem we readily agree to look into , and of course our people were n't long in spotting the trouble . I had an analysis made and a memorandum prepared to show her she was misunderstanding the basic nature of her business . Though retail sales were made in a shop , it was not shopkeeping , not essentially a retail merchandising operation . In basic nature her business , she must realize , is part service industry , part agency . It is service in that she seeks out and brings to one convenient place a far larger and more varied array of articles than prospectivepurchasers have the inclination , time , and knowledgeableness to locate for themselves . It is agency in that she ought to ( she must if she is to prosper ) do all her more important buying with known prospective customers in mind . The things she brings together , if her outlay for them is more than minimal , ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for , and she must buy them with a regard for what she knows a customer is prepared to pay . The point of agency will be plain if she considers the fact , at first sight perhaps something of a joke , that much of her best business will regularly be done in buying from or sellingto other dealers . No , they are not taking in each other 's washing . They buy as agent for a customer they know who wants something they see she has . She buys as agent for a customer she knows who wants something she sees they have.  |p199Not  clear about what she was doing , Judith , plainly to us , had in her first years of business at The Whale never bothered to determine true overhead or currentcosts of inventory . We have people expert in these computations . They could show her that a markup on cost price to give a percentage profit reasonable ( and lucrative ) in straight merchandising did not give her a real profit . Onto her selling price she must tack her service fee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marking-up has to be roughly aoo per cent ) . We can then also make her understand right managementof her special kind of inventory . As is not the case in straight merchandising , she may well profit by drasticallymarking down for a very quick turnover ; but she must not fail progressively to mark up ( how this goes against the grain with the unbusinesslike ! ) all articles that do n't move in the course of each year . The buyer who eventually wants them ( and she must learn not to stock stuff no buyer could ever want ) should have charged on him her costs in keeping them for him . I think it not too much to say that Judith 's asking our advice and her having the wisdom to take it was largely responsible for The Whale 's very soon beginning to make money . She was thus enabled steadily to upgrade her stock until she handled only articles of first quality and real value , offering pieces for collectors and connoisseurs , which in the antiques trade is where high profit lies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association was brought about , I feel sure the business 's ever-growing success did more than a little to shape my later attitude toward her and hers toward me . He whose asked advices are heeded is apt to find himself feelingp200good will toward the heeder of them . Monetarily much benefited , the heeder , feeling a sort of universal good will prosperity always engenders , is apt even to forgive the adviser for being right , to have nothing in the world against him . When , a few years later , Charlotte'sunhappy death occurred , I got a prompt note from Judith about her being shocked and saddened by the news . Her civil phrasings of sympathy made it plain that she had nothing in the world against me . So I wait . So I move loitering on . I come among the buried Bannisters . Lucy , I read , Second Wife of Joseph Bannister Esquire . Died 6th of May 1837 . . . . The stone bears a verse : The brittle Clay alas has broke / And let the Spirit fly / Prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the world of Joseph Bannister , Esquire , Lucy 's demise , though regrettable , would appear to be a same old story . Joseph supportshis loss with resigned reasonableness . He lets you know he can face facts . As a youth , anxious to exhibit my fine sensibilities to myself , I remember I used to find the philosophical undertones conceitedly complacent , unlikablycallous . Perhaps they still are , but now I ask myself : What else is there to say ? I hear a sound behind me . I turn . I see Elaine coming across the narrow road . She looks distressed . She lacks my schooling in these terminal processes . While she has had two children of hers die , she did not see them die . They were killed hundreds of miles away . She was n't sitting by . I question if she has ever seen anyone die , or even any dead person . Coming up to me ( if shaken , how smart in appear/ance she manages to remain ) Elaine says : " He thinks she ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , because you ca n't understand her . I mean , whether she 's willing . I do n't think she is . Neither does Miss Glave  --  though for all I know she may just want to keep her job . " I perceive that ' he ' must be the doctor . I take Miss Glave to be the nurse 's name . I say : " Did he explain why ? " Elaine shrugs . Though in movement the same , this shrug is not to be mistaken for the shrug of indifference . It expresses anguish of helplessness and uncertainty . She says : " He thinks a lot more could be done  --  done better , there . " I say : " Yes ; he means they might be able to keep her alive a good deal longer . " ( Well , does n't Claudio sue to live ? ) I say : " Do you want me to talk to him  --  or to her ? " Elaine says : " Not to her . It 's no good . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ask a question . She never answers it . When she can , she just comes back with something else that has n't anything to do with anything . What would you talk to him about ? " I say : " That would depend on what he told me . If he thinks she could be made more comfortable , and if she 's willing to be moved , I 'd of course tell him I 'd make expense no object . " Elaine says : " Oh I do n't think he 's considering that . He understands Mother is n't short of money . One funny thing . He tells me his father was a friend of Mother 's father , knew him very well  --  I think in Washington . I mean , it 's funny because he has n't practiced here long  --  he was n't born here or anything . He and his wifep202started furnishing this house they 'd bought a couple of years ago and they looked in one day to see what Mother had . I expect they supposed antiques were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess they got a shock . I think they bought a couple of candlesticks . But he 'd noticed the name , so he happened to ask her if by any chance a clergyman , a Canon Conway , had been a relative of hers . " I say : " What 's his name ? " Elaine says : " Baker . Does it mean anything to you ? " I say : " I 'm not sure . His father may have been one of the people the Canon played chess with by mail . The Washington part fits in . That 's where he was a canon  --  at the cathedral there . " Elaine says : " Well , it seemed funny to have her able to say : Yes , he was my father . Except things like that happen all the time , I 've found . I suppose you can only say it 's a small world . Anyway , it must have been knowingshe was a clergyman 's daughter that made him ask me this morning if I thought she 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't remember her ever going to church . So he said : Sometimes Catholics do want one . I said : Would a Catholic clergyman have a daughter ? " Here , not unexpectedly , we have one of Elaine 's painful flippancies of pain . I must not notice in any way or she will go to pieces . I say : " Maybe I 'd better see this Doctor Baker . You make me wonder just how competenthe can be . " Elaine says : " Is there ever any way of telling ? " I say : " No , unless you 're a physician yourself . But he seems to be a little weak-minded . If they want a clergy/man , a priest , patients say so . You 'd never have to ask . And if he knew , or knew of , your mother 's father , he ca n't suppose he was a Catholic . " Elaine says : " Still and all , do n't I remember his beingjust as Anglo-Catholic as hell ? Maybe that 's what Doctor Baker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say : " I wish you were not so upset . Ask Doctor Bakerif he 'll see me . And then I want you to go and sit in the car . You must stop trying to take care of things . I 'll take care of them . " Elaine says : " Yes , I am upset . You see , I really do n't like Mother a bit . And now look at her . " So that she will not cry she contorts her mouth tightly . She turns sharp and walks back across the road . Neither do I know why Elaine should remember anythingmuch about her mother 's father . She was perhaps six years old when he died , and she could have seen him only once or twice , but in what she remembers she is correct . For approximately fifteen years he was the incumbentat St. George 's , to which the college community'sEpiscopalians went . The college in its religious origins had been , of course , Congregational ( and nominally , or as far as college chapel goes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divinity which the first president had added to the curriculum of the Reverend Elnathan 's transferred academy ' were dropped about 1850 , the Faculty Row people began , more and more of them , to be Episcopalians . Hosea Cuthbertson , ProfessorCaleb 's father and the textile magnate , came of a family that had been parishioners of old Trinityp204Church in Newport , Rhode Island , before the Revolution , and they faithfully remained so through the difficultperiod when what was regarded as the King 's Church ' almost disappeared . In Hosea 's time ( surely not unaided by the chance that quite a few families of habitual communicants like his were acquiring riches in the new industrial developments ) the striking comeback , the gradual resurrection of prestige , was here and there beginning ; yet it still had some way to go , and Caleb was at first the college 's one Episcopalian of moment . Caleb 's will having provided what was then a large sum for the purpose , the modest frame structure where he had attended services was replaced by what that day saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arched edifice of burnt-brick bastard Romanesque . Services in the new church quickly became well attended . No general conversion of Congregationalists was ever observed , but the number of college people who went to St. George 's steadily grew . By the turn of the century nothing odd was found in the college president presiding over daily chapel  --  to be sure , more a roll-call device than an act of worship  --  as a sort of ex-officio Congregationalistwhile going to St. George 's Sundays . As rector of St. George 's , Canon Conway was quite unconnected with the college , yet ( as so often happenedwith college officers and faculty members ) his call ' to St. George 's almost certainly resulted from circumstancesof relationship and association . His wife , Judith 's mother , was a sister of the President Abernethy of whom I 've spoken . While I do n't know it as a fact , I much suspect that Canon Conway was looking for a jobp205because his Washington dean had decided the Canon 's zealous high-church activities and particularly his deep involvement in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his position being what it was , ill-advised , gravely impolitic . The cathedral'sservices and functions needed often to be of a national , and , so , non-denominational , sort . Here was not the place to emphasize catholic practice . ' Amicably enough , I would judge ( he remained an honorary member of the chapter all his life ) , a suggestion that he might be more suitably and satisfyingly employed elsewheremay have been made to him . On the face of it , St. George 's would hardly seem the right spot for the promotion of catholic practice ' either ( a reserving of the sacrament would have horrified Caleb Cuthbertson ) ; but the Canon , like the Confraternity , may have seen it as quite a good spot , an openingfor missionary work where most needed , and , because  it was a college town , a place where the young , so important to reach , might be reached  --  and anyway the appointment could be got for him . When his installationtook place , with him from Washington he brought his wife , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then about fifteen . That was how I first met Judith . At the time she was a rather skinny but graceful girl , pretty in a thin-faced , dark-eyed , dark-haired way . Despitethe coltish skinniness , her breasts and buttocks showed a marked , no doubt recent , development which might account for a shyly self-conscious manner , retiring and moody ; but it was soon apparent that she also came in that category of faculty children whop206mutely resent , inwardly rebel against , the cloistered community life that their parents ' positions make them live . I did n't know enough to know it then , but later I would see that roots of Judith 's discontent and resentmentwere deeper still . Her father , though a gentlespoken , kindly man and always treating her fairly and reasonably , did not quite succeed in concealing from her the truth that religious or spiritual scruples he had developedmade him regret her existence , and that he would not if he had it to do again undertake marriage and child-getting . In short , as Elaine , distressed into flippancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergymen ' have daughters ? The error of Judith lay beyond correction ( We have this treasure in earthen vessels ) , but the Canon could at least see to it that more children were n't got . I do n't doubt that after Judith 's birth he imposed on himself and Gertrude what the Roman church calls a fratersororrelationship that let him live the celibate life he believed his holy orders required of him . Gertrude Conwayapparently accepted the arrangement with no fuss of record . She could even , I remember , behave toward her husband ' with what would pass for harmonious attachment ; but she also showed clear symptomatic signs of what I now recognize as nervous tension  --  that drawn , paper-thin look of chronic endocrine deficiency or malaise that normal women might naturally suffer when united to those which have made themselves ( in point of practice , at any rate ) eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven 's sake . Just as her father 's care to be kind to her could not keep a child of any sensitiveness unaware of his peni/tent inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproach to him , her mother 's state of tension must press disturbingly on her consciousness  --  all the more so since here again what transpired to her could be only a kind of secret scary something , never identifiedclearly or given a name . I must wonder whether this is the type of childhood experience , rather than the sudden short shock however severe , that can prove truly and lastingly traumatic . It seems to me possible that a child 's presentative grasping of guiltiness secretly felt about her by her father and a consequent conviction that for hidden ununderstandable reasons she was unwanted , particularly when going with a similar presentativegrasping of mystery in her mother 's ill-being  --  the secret mental discomforts that give Mother no peace ; the nervous debility that wastes her body  --  and lived with year after year , must be bound to shape or misshape attitudes of mind and , so , foster permanent instabilities of temperament which , when expressions of them emerge later , can look reasonless , unaccountable . This , you will remember , was the matter Elaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been speaking of . Roundabout , by way of tearfully reviewing her personal unhappinesses , she came , as I described , to bring up her mother , to tell me of that afternoon of hers on the dunes at Old Harbor . We have remained seated there by the pink-marble table in the pleasant shade of the pergola . She has just spoken of the supposed traumatic effect on adolescents of a shock likep208hers ; but when that happens , she bets , the brat has to have been all along a damn odd brat . ( She is reacting to my show of paternal consternation . She 's more to be censured , she wants you to know , than pitied . She wo n't have you pitying her . ) Jon LeCato waits in my room . Those people we intend to confer with at luncheon ( whoever they may have been , still they were n't unimportant or I would n't have had them out ) will presently be waiting , too . But I do n't want to check Elaine . My presentiment is that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chest . I want to see her talked out . ' I would wish to dismiss her with the usually resulting peace and consolation , the automatic calm of mind , all passion spent . I am right . She was merely pausing  --  I would gather to brood a moment about that damn odd brat . She says : " Or perhaps it would be , part of it , how fond you were of your mother . And I suppose that can depend on how fond you feel she is of you  --  she 's crazy about you , so you 're crazy about her . It 's a deal . " Father says : " Possibly . " I ask myself what the recurringfigure of deals , contracts , quids for quos that Elaine so often resorts to may mean . In matters of thinking , all right ; in matters of feeling , perfect nonsense . Does she seriously believe it true , or does she simply want , deeply wish , it to be true ? Elaine says : " Well , all I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling I 'd stopped mattering a damn to Mother . You do n't need to be very sensitive  --  and I was n't ; I was imperceptive as anything  --  to notice when you are n't getting concern , interest , attention , God knows what , you 've always been used to . It miffedp209me . I was having this all-right-for-you feeling . I know I did n't just imagine she was different . " Father says : " No , you did n't just imagine . Something was happening to her . The person you were used to would be away for a while  --  nothing imaginary about it . Looking at it that way may help . " Elaine says : " Now it might , yes . And now maybe understandingall could be forgiving all  --  though not quite , I think . It would n't have helped then . Then , I would n't have cared why it was . And about forgiving , the funny fact is I could n't even have said then what I was forgiving . It was n't as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me  --  bawling me out , not letting me have what I wanted , punishing me when I had n't done anything . The truth is , I think I would have been less upset if she had been mean . Then I 'd have known exactly why I was sore . All I knew was that I felt Mother had stopped being fond of me , wished she had n't had me . " ( A point to note might be how curiously close this is to what Mother ' as a girl must have felt about her father , the Canon . ) I say : " Another fact , maybe funny , too , is that she never did stop being fond of you . Not in normal moments  --  I suppose you might say ; not when she was able to remember you . At the time of the matter I mentioned , what she was afraid you might be up to at college , she was badly worried . Quite normal , the ordinary everyday mother-and-child emotional involvement . Other parts of her life did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of you getting into situationsyou had n't the experience to know could easily end in a lot of grief for you . "  |p210Elaine  says : " Life 's little contrarieties ? Do what I say ; do n't do what I do ? That was a damn silly crack , was n't it ? I guess it means I still get sore at her when I think back . And by now I know everybody can be complicated and nobody 's the same all the time . But at fourteen I did n't go around reflecting that people can be complicatedor that I was being pretty complicated myself . So that afternoon  --  yes , I could be shocked , I could be scared ; but , no , I was n't  --  well , wounded , feeling pain . How it would have been if I 'd loved her I ca n't say . But I did n't ; I suppose I really hated her . I 'd been secretly , privately , sore at Mother for months , if you see what I mean . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Yes , I do ; but can I say I also see why she wants to drive in this point ? No , I ca n't . ) Elaine says : " No , I was n't feeling a bit of pain . Even if I hardly realized it then , my real feeling , deep down , inside , was plain pleasure . I could feel it served her just exactly right to have this awful horrible thing  --  when all you 've ever seen was once or twice what dogs did , and were n't sure of anything about it , horrible 's how it can look  --  being done to her , happening to her . Sure , I might get kid-stuff top-of-the-head ideas about drowning myself for shame , but all the time underneath , to itself , the sulking little bitch in me whispered : Goody , goody ! Not the pleasantest of pictures . " Ah , thinks Father , now we get there . It 's more of the same . Damn your eyes , I 'll stop you from looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry for me . I 'm shamed and I 'm sunk but I do n't have to have it pressed down and running over by Daddy 's fatheadedp211opining that I 'm mighty like a rose . I say : " No ; but since you do see the picture it ought to help you see how it could have been with your mother . That 's it ; there 's you with your kid stuff , and there 's the little bitch in you . But a little heroine or a little angel might turn up there just as well . That 's why you find nobody 's the same all the time . You said what the little bitch liked was having a bad thing happen to her . The bitch got the point . " Elaine says : " The little angel does n't seem to get it . " I say : " No , how could she ? But it 's there if you look . This was happening to her . Remember , you said you saw later what their being where they were meant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer  --  and not this Monty . " I say : " No , Monty would n't be the somebody . Only , what you thought of as Mother ' probably was n't the somebody either . A different person , a somebody else in her , is running this . It notices a fellow like Monty . It simply says to her : He 'll do . You 'll have to have him for me . Find a place and do n't be long . " Elaine says : " Are n't we getting kind of corny ? " A nice question . The word 's meaning to her is what the lexicons call a nonce use . The definition by Wentworthand Flexner is : sentimental , banal , obvious , oldfashionedor out of date , unsophisticated . Yes , Father as I hear him is getting to be corny . I say : " Not we , my dear ; just I. I used to think what was corny must be false . Now  --  well , one could wish as a matter of taste it was n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've got to accept it : fact can be cheap and fact can be silly . " Elaine says : " Oh , I accept it . I know quite a few cheap and silly facts about me . But in things like this all I canp212think of is : what if I were doing it ? I 'm being made to ? Nuts ! A somebody else in me ? My eye ! All that 's in me is I crave a roll in the hay . If I happen to be wanting it bad , maybe it 's a little like : I have to have him  --  no choice . But still , I 'm making one , are n't I ? I 'm choosing not to pass it up . " She begins to shake her head . " Okay , it 's for the psychiatrists . Sure , since I might be doing it against my better judgment , afterward I could be real sorry . What the hell made me do it ? Have n't I ever sense enough to keep those legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastard you , at least do n't be giving me any you-never-wanted-to stuff . Of course this is only myself and me discussing the me we love so well , and we 're not psychiatrists . " Father says : " It 's for the psychiatrists , all right . " And so perhaps are these words , words , words ; this compulsive laboring laboriously to explain . My presentimentwas that Elaine needed to talk some more . Need I , all pomposity , it seems , and unction , talk more , too ? Apparently , yes . ) I say : " No , you do n't believe it if you have n't seen it . You 've just been explaining that . After you 've watched them awhile you get to be pretty sure people never choose to do what they do n't want to do . What they do may be painful , disagreeable , very hard on them , but even so they plainly like doing it better than not doing it . " Elaine says : " Well , I still think it 's mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up with me and my stupid jams is because you 'd really rather . " Father says : " Yes , I 'd rather . That 's why . That 's the natural thing . You expect a person to be always doingp213what he 'd rather do . You think it 's how everyone has to be . That 's what 's so very disturbing when you find someone you know well  --  you have to know the person well to see it  --  doing differently , not choosing to , not wanting to do what 's being done . You begin to understand why , when they believed in evil spirits , people talked about demoniac possession . There 's something there that was n't there before . What ? That 's easy ; an incubus , of course . Quick , get an exorcist to come and cast it out . " I pause . No , you do n't know what to call it . There just are n't any words to make clearer this fact of the matter as known to me . Maybe your awareness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . You feel the person is n't in charge of himself  --  well , in my experience , herself . There 's a dismayed , vaguely alarmed sense of ( human nature 's world turned upside down ) normal self-interest no longer ruling  --  abdicated ; forcibly dethroned . Lamely I say : " I suppose the thing got over to you is compulsion present  --  the person is n't wanting to do what he does but do it he must . And the compulsion of course need n't be your mother 's , the one you could see in her for a while . I think you often find whatever it is in people who are going to kill themselves . You may not realize that that 's what they 'll come to , but if you knew them well and had been paying attention I think you 'll usually remember you kept having that **29;9412;TOOLONG .

They do n't use guns  --  on themselves . They slash their wrists or swallow something . " I say : " For everyone 's sake we will let it stay an accidental shotgun discharge . Fortunately nobody ever told her how to do it the right way  --  in your mouth , muzzle up against the roof . She just put the side of her head to it . That let Doctor Perkins , an old friend of mine , show the coroner , an old friend of his , that she must have been dusting guns in the gun case , and one happened to be loaded with the safety off . Incidentally , that had to be true . I ca n't think how a gun could ever have been put in the case loaded with the safety off , but she would n't have known how to load a gun . " Elaine says : " Oh , but then why could n't it have been an accident ? How can you be sure  --  yes ; I see . Why on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Just forget what I said . Father , I feel really terrible . Let 's not talk any more about it . People ought n't to do things like that to other people . " I say : " I think almost none of them chooses to . That 's what I was speaking of . No , we wo n't talk about it . " ( And , no , I will not go into such enabling circumstancesas the decision I reached , once we moved our office out of town , making the drive down not too long , to go back with Charlotte and live in the Faculty Row house where I was born and which I owned  --  and still own and still live in . The college , the town where she had grown up , unlike Judith , very happily were to Charlotte home , and she did not seem happy in New York . The house was comfortable and , as I say , belonged to me  --  the college was simply using it on short-termp215leases for faculty housing , and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can easily be guessed . I was disturbed by moods of mild depression Charlotte tried to hide but could n't . By returning her ' home ' I was hoping to relieve this innominate , not exactlyunhappiness , but silent sadness in her of which I was becoming conscious . The idea did appear to please Charlotte , and when the academic year was over and the house vacated we went up to check on what would need to be done  --  in a house where tenants have been living for a long time you may be sure a good deal will need to be done , especially when it was furnished , most of it the way it was when my father moved to the President'sHouse . What took place to turn the idea of coming'home ' into a bad one , what it was about a plan apparentlymost pleasing to her that became abruptly more than Charlotte could bear , is among my **27;9443;TOOLONG mysteries  --  did she perhaps , hopes pinned on it , quickly know in a wrecking way that this was n't going to work ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there , to stay in the house while we checked what needed to be done . Where but there could , by curious chance , a rack of guns be ready to her hand ? The curious chance was that west of the town , beginningonly a little in back of the Faculty Row properties , stretched extensive hilly woodlands and high meadows , good shooting country well stocked with game ; while a deep rapid brook with excellent trout pools ran nearby . Perhaps access so easy to field and stream first led male Faculty Row residents to be , as by custom or habit they long had been , keen sportsmenp216in season . When I was a child my father and nearly all his faculty associates assiduously shot and fished  --  though I must wonder whether what made them assiduouswas not so much actual sporting zeal as the wish to manifest through dog and gun , through rod and reel , manliness of the outdoorsman , the regular fellow , about which they might suspect , because of their vocation 's pedagogy and book learning , a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun rack contained were my father 's ; and from his leaving them behind with the other furnishings when he moved to the President 's House I think it reasonable to infer that during his younger years he had merely gone along with custom , having no honest liking for blood sports , and never enjoying the happy excitement felt by the real hunter in filling a game bag . I suppose , discoveringthem there , a later tenant last made use of them , and , unaccustomed to handling guns , left one loaded . While in this connection I can , if I like , remember that , as Elaine remarked , there could always be wrists to slash and substances to swallow I will most surely not mention the note which I at once , even before I telephoned Doctor Perkins , destroyed . Hank  --  I read  --  I just have to get out of this . I do n't know why . Please , please do n't think it has anything to do with you  --  us . I would have done it before except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm sorry .

Charlotte. )  |p217Elaine  says : " Oh , how bad for you . You must n't think about it . " I say : " You think about it at first when you remember you 'd had that what-goes-on feeling for some time . Still , what could you have done ? Fairly soon , you just stop thinking about it . " Elaine 's face is losing the lines of strain . Herself has slipped from her mind . A little catharsis is taking place ; here we have some calm of mind , most passion spent . She stands up . She comes around the pink-marble table . Lithely , she bends and kisses my forehead . She says : " I 'm going . I 'll call you later . I 'll drive up and stay with you . " Under the lofty brick barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conway celebrate the Holy Eucharist . The parish bulletin no longer calls the service Holy Communion  --  he has seen to that ; but he recognizes the expediency of making haste slowly and he does not feel the time is yet ripe to make the service Mass . Still , he celebrates in full vestment regaliaamice , alb , girdle , maniple , stole , and ( today being Trinity Sunday ) chasuble of gleaming white satin whose elaborate orphreys are worked in heavy giltthreadembroidery . On his breast hangs his canon 's pectoralcross . Now he is passing along the altar rail with its line of kneeling people . He bears reverently the gold paten from which he lifts the wafers he has consecrated to lay them on extended palms of communicants . Earnestly , his mellifluous voice carrying only a trace of the stammer he has trained himself to control , he pro/nounces to each : " The B-B-Body of Our Lord Jesus Christ which was given for thee ; p-p-preserve thy b-bbodyand soul unto everlasting life . . .. " The Canon , if he had his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock sung ' Eucharist . He believesthe sacrament should be received fasting , not on top of breakfast . However , like getting the Holy Sacrificespoken of as Mass , that will need time , further schooling in catholic practice , before his parishioners ' habit can be broken and they will , when they mean to communicate , go not to Solemn High Mass but to earlier celebrations of Low Mass . By then , he heartily hopes , the communicants will also have been brought to know they should n't receive if they did not , during yesterday 's afternoon and evening hours for hearing them , make their confessions . By that time , too , he looks to having the reserved sacrament in a tabernacle to be added to the high altar with a burning sanctuary lamp  --  not , as at present , half hidden away in the little St. Mary 's chapel adjoining the sacristy . ( Nor does the Canon like hearing the chapel 's patroness so named . She is Our Lady , surely . ) The number of those knowing no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not great . There are only enough of them to line the altar rail once . However , this can be no good omen for the Canon 's intentions ; it tells , rather , of his task 's magnitude . The established devotional habit of most of this his flock is a going Sundays with regularity to church where Morning Prayer and sermon are politely listened to . Leaving ( ite missy est ) , they shake hands with the rector at the door and return home to Sundayp219dinner . Publicly to get up , openly to come forward and partake of the Lord 's Supper would , many of them feel , have an impropriety of ostentation , an unseemliness of what used to be called enthusiasm , ' a doing to a degree of the not-done ( and , as far as their instruction goes , the not-necessary ) . On the other hand , of those coming forward and partaking , some I know are doing so because they see it as , for them , most proper and seemly , quite necessary , though not for reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rail is that weekday Congregationalist my father , the now-president of the college , and my mother . They have regard for my father'sofficial position . This may seem a paradox , but it is one of a kind common in practices of form . Because the college long ago dropped the divinity courses that turned out rustic preachers , because succeeding presidentsand a good many of the faculty had abandoned the homespun faith of their fathers ( or predecessors ) , President Worthington feels it all the more required of him to show faithfulness in religious observance . He gives personal evidence that this later college has not by changes grown Godless as an institution . Nothing of the kind is required of me . I and the three college classmates of mine who sit beside me are chance attendants , detached spectators only . I have just finishedmy junior year at Harvard . Jon LeCato , Percy Cundill , Knox Frothingham , and I have run up from Cambridge in Percy 's new Cole 8 roadster , which his affluent broker-father this spring gave him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivep220down next Wednesday to Gloucester , where we will take summer passage on a small schooner whose eccentric owner and skipper , a hulking redheaded man named Ronald Critchlow , is assembling , to be signed on as deck hands , a dozen or so college youths . He does not pay them . Each engages to pay him his prorated share of what operating expenses prove to be . Our projected cruise is to Bermuda , to Havana , where we will see some Latin-American life ( including , it is to turn out , a La Gloria Street brothel of note ) , and north again to obscure coral islands in the Bahamas which old charts Mr. Critchlow has discovered hint may hide pirate treasure ; and then , ahead ( Ronny ' hopes ) of the hurricane season 's onset , back up the coast to Jacksonville , Charleston , Norfolk , reaching Boston shortly before college opens . While we will go under sail as far as possible , the ship has powerful auxiliary engines that can be called on to make sure we make it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , with assistancefrom a run of best-selling books ( two of them by Mr. Critchlow ) , such voyaging , if you could afford it ( note overtones of Lure of the Sea ; Wooden Ships and Iron Men ; and , for that matter , Blow the Man Down ) , was by everyone regarded as romantic , venturesome , and virile . The attendance at St. George 's Trinity Sunday comes about through odd and pretentious workings of an attitudewe cultivated known then as Harvard indifference . ' Our policy was one of a frequent deliberate doingof the altogether unexpected though not along lines of raising hell , which was disdained as collegiate ' childishness . Indifference expressed in bored eschewal ofp221the stuffy and formal was too simple and obvious . Our so much more recherche indifference found triumphant expression in seeking out and with studied nonchalance supporting boredom and banality  --  and indeed the exerciseof not giving a damn can hardly go further . Our secret object was of course to invite and , though letting no sign be seen , to enjoy astonishment we could occasionby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing only because he must or thought he must . At the time , religious belief was normally discarded on or before leaving preparatory school , and the atmosphereof Cambridge hardly encouraged churchgoing for devotional reasons . That would be as unthinkable as showing active interest in a lecture course or raising a hand when a section man asked a question in class . Now and then to attend divine service , clearly on a whim of the moment , constituted another thing altogether  --  forthe very reason we could have no reasons to , an indifference recherche indeed  --  really quite on a par with accepting an invitation to eat dinner at the strikingly scruffy , full-of-earnest-causes Liberal Club ; or deciding on Memorial Day with solemn ceremony to decorate a few graves of Revolutionary soldiers in the Harvard Square cemetery next to Christ Church . Therefore as my friends and I breakfast late Sunday morning and I remark that my parents , who ate earlier , were getting ready to go to church because it 's expected of my father , I am unsurprised to have Knox yawn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like some piety this morning . That last pint of gin , d' you think ? And Jon and Percy are always standing in the need of prayer . "  |p222I  answer ( nil admirari ) : " Well , that 's a thought . Our rector 's got a keen-looking daughter . I 'll see you meet her afterward . " My parents are a trifle taken aback when I go up and tell them , but by now my type of Cambridge-learned pose and affected whim must have come to be familiar , and all too familiar , to my father . He can at least be sure we are not up to the kind of college prank ' some of his own undergraduates  --  or , for that matter , those of Princeton or Yale  --  might have in mind . His confidenceis entirely justified . A show in all seriousness of perfect propriety is of our entertainment 's essence . Our faces sober , our manner carefully grave , we watch ceremonialpractices of the natives , the antic sacred rituals enacted under our eyes . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point out Judith Conway to my friends . Her position , ' like my father 's , imposes regularattendance on her . Soon now she will rebel ; but she has not yet . Percy Cundill emphatically agrees with me about her appearance . " Anything doing ? " he says in a well-bred whisper . " Do n't know , " I murmur . " Have n't tried . " He murmurs : " You have n't tried ? Tell me another . " Accepting the soft impeachment , excusing myself , I murmur back : " Never around here long enough . " My friend 's expressed incredulity would suggest that our Hank must have come a great way in amorous exploitsince his blushful Afternoon of Mrs. Van den Arend ; and in a sense I have  --  though not so far as I 'm gratified to find Percy believing . Let me remind myselfp223of Elaine and her friends of later college generation , with their hard strivings to appear sophisticated . It is to be observed that in truth their fault is youth , not , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I and they  --  look patently absurd . As noted before , my youthfulerrors seem all to be trivialities of the ordinary , the quite usual . The spectacle I 'm compelled to watch myselfmaking of myself is without dignity of real evil-doing . When now in dumb show or tableau vivant where I move or stand posed as ass , now in sordid short scenes where I act , and superbly , the callow cad , involved are nothing more than petty shames and follies , little nastinessesand vulgarities , sins contemptibly venial . Here is such a scene . Time : the early summer after our Hank 's last year at preparatory school . Place : the environs of a large resort hotel in the White Mountains where some sort of philological conference is being held . Our Hank 's father is to present an important paperon Middle English verse and prose with special consideration of phonology in The Owl and the Nightingale , Sawles Ward , and Layamon 's Brut , and will join in discussions with colleagues from many colleges and universities . Young Hank and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to go down and open the Old Harbor house until after the conference concluded . Among the staff of waitresses hired by the hotel for the season is one named Myrtle  --  did he ever know her other name ? who is about twenty . While not particularlypretty , she seems to project from her physical personan aura , musky , sensual , rather sluttish . When on the night of their arrival he and his parents come to the dining room and she appears prompt and smiling atp224their table to take their order for dinner , our Hank is strangely stirred . As he watches her leaving and returning with her tray , coming close to him while she sets out plates or removes them , he finds himself having astonishinglylecherous thoughts . Usually that would be as far as the matter went , but later the same evening ( by mere chance , not by his design ) he encounters her leaving the hotel 's lower arcade of little shops to go across to the staff quarters . Again stirred , he says : Hello , and she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in arranging to meet her and on succeeding nights take her for walks ' when her work is done and the dark makes them unlikely to be seen . In a nearby , yet out-of-theway , small pine grove they pass , kissing and hugging , an hour or so . Tonight when we see them enter the dark scene to sit together on the mound of soft disintegrating pine needlesour Hank has resolved to face the thing he fears . It is his last chance . The conferees have worked their no doubt rewarding way through Layamon 's Brut and the many other businesses of similar scholarly interest brought before them . Tomorrow he leaves with his parentsfor Old Harbor . Embracing her , he screws his courage to what may as well be called the screwing point . Pressing her back , tugging up her skirt clumsily , he imposeshimself on her to her frantic whispers of : Oh you ca n't . No , I wo n't let you . . . But though she struggles still desperately whispering : No , no , no . Oh you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now finding that her underclothes have been left off . He says , shaking with excitement , busy-handed : I wo n't hurt you . If you 'll just let me . . She pants : You promise ? You promise ? Youp225wo n't go in me ? Oh you are going in me . Oh you must n't . Oh stop . Oh you 're doing it . . . . She begins to cry . Tears are wetting the face under his mouth when , too inexperienced to know how to hold back , he with precipitation discharges himself . Though instantly clutching him tight , though herself belatedly , weakly convulsed , she whimpers : Oh you promised . Oh you 're so mean . Oh you did n't even take precautions . Suppose I have a baby . . . In point of fact our Hank , too , has that worrying him through the summer . He thinks of her turning up pregnant at Old Harbor to name him as her prospective child 's father . He has also some immediately following weeks of fearing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at amorous sport by this ( Percy Cundill believes ) great cocksman . It is almost two years ( which of course seems to him a long time ) since the facile semirape , the protested but actually unresistedravishment of a by-no-means-maiden Myrtle under the pines . In the kind of sophistication he so vacuously aspires to our Hank progresses . Learning together , he and his friends keep teaching each other more tricks in affecting superiority , snobbish additions to the count of what is to be held infra dig . A resort hotelwaitress , for God 's sake ! ( But , when cruising with Mr. Critchlow they put ashore in Havana  --  sun- , sea- , and wind-seasoned salts with a yo ho ho and a bottle of rum  --  superiority is going to keep none of them , at the select brothel of which Ronny ' has knowledgeably let them know , from addressing himself to the plump little mulatto girl naked and supine on an ornate bed in a mirrored room who matter-of-factly spreads her legs. )  |p226Still  , in general , amatory renown worth winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base and obscure vulgar . You must prove your prowess among your social ( and intellectual ) equals . The times and the customs , the standing orders of current proprietyand morality , continue to restrict opportunity . As a rule you may hope to find it only with the relativelyfew young women who , while of good background , are sufficiently contemptuous of convention to have gained the repute of being what was known as fast . ' On an attractive Wellesley College sophomore , a Miss Joyce King , who seems to come in this category , our Hank has all spring had designs . He expects her  --  even in a way wishes her  --  to be hard to get . Pursuit of a well-known pushover would scarcely be the thing . Miss King 's parents are people of means , and this affordsher a privileged upbringing 's assurance , gives her a mind of her own . Though her dormitory is , appropriatelyenough , Pomeroy , at the time notable for accomplishedpartygoers and dancers rather than bespectacledscholars , she is not rattlebrained and has shown herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Joyce King is reputed to be fast , ' that is mostly **26;9472;TOOLONG college mates , usually themselveslittle sought after , know she gads about a great deal , coming often into Boston afternoons to go teadancingand missing none of the big socially desirable Copley Plaza balls , where all evening she will seldom get once around the floor without someone cutting in . For our Hank there can clearly be no rushing things , but Miss King is promisingly willing to accept a drink ofp227ginger ale laced with synthetic gin and to smoke a cigarette ( in those days if her college authorities caught her doing either she would be expelled at once ) . Promisingly , too , she exhibits marked literary and artistic tastes  --  always a help in these matters . This afternoon , a fine late May one , our Hank carries in his pocket the key to the elegant apartment of a Bostoninterior decorator named Roberts whom he has come to know through New England Poetry Society meetings . ( His interest now is n't his eager , hopeful earlier interest , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get altogether over being interested in writing . ' ) Though himself , as the case so usually is , a homosexual , Mr. Roberts looks , for reasons best known to him , with friendly eye on all forms of venery and goes out of his way to promote them , gladly vacating his apartment  --  even offering it , proposing its use  --  for purposes of seduction . On his jade-green walls hang distinguishedoriginal modern paintings that Miss King could not but like to see . She is sufficiently emancipatedto feel no hesitation in going alone with him to look at them . They do look at them ; they discuss them . Their absent host has set out gin and ginger ale and ice for his guests . They prepare drinks and sip them together , sitting on the divan and holding cultured converseof the bright amusing kind . To our lustful Hank she begins to look about ready . He makes , but with more suitable suavity , gently , the tugged-up-skirt approach , murmuring : Had we but world enough , and time , this coyness lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional female response of the period she slaps his face hard . She says :  |p228I  know all that . Now listen to me . If what you 're after is a girl to be dirty with , you picked the wrong one . I 've let you take me out because I liked you . But I 'm not goingto like you long if you try this kind of thing . Think it over and let me know.  |p229HE  CONFRATERNITY of theBlessed Sacrament , formally constituted in England five years earlier by a small group of Anglican clergymen , had by 1867 attracted in America its first Episcopalian Associates . One sees the possibility that the original constitutorsmay have been motivated , as well as by piety , by feelings that the Anglican Establishment tended to make little of Holy Orders as Holy Orders ( but very much of what preferment ordinants through family or other influence might or might not contrive to gain ) , with the result that taking orders afforded those in them nothing like the veneration a Roman cleric as anointed priest and sorcerer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were united in a resolve to restore to the Church of England and the Anglican communities elsewhere what they called its catholic heritage . Chief Object ' of restoration was to be : the honor due the Person of Our Lord Jesus Christ in the Blessed Sacrament of His Body and Blood.  |p230The  Articles of Religion as established by the Bishops , the Clergy , and the Laity of the Protestant Episcopalchurch in the United States of America in conventionon the 12th day of September in the year of Our Lord 1801 could not but make the undertaking look decidedlyheterodox to most of the church 's **29;9500;TOOLONG . Required of the Confraternity 's Associates was extensive casuistry if they were to demonstratehow the letter of , say , Article XXVIII , or Article XXXI , could be read to leave allowable what the spirit of the time of establishment manifestly intended to ban and denounce . For example , among exact words of ArticleXXVIII are : The Sacrament of the Lord 's Supper was not by Christ 's ordinance reserved , carried about , li f ted up , or worshipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out that nothing here categorically forbids any of these uses . And the matter of the Real Presence ? Does n't the articlesay in so many words : . . . the Bread which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ and likewise the Cup of Blessing is a partaking of the Blood of Christ ? True , a bit of awkwardness ensues when the text proceeds : Transubstantiation ( or the change of the substanceof Bread and Wine ) in the Supper of the Lord can not be proved by Holy Writ but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture , overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament , and hath given occasion to many superstitions . Yet after the article 's own earlier plain words about what is partaken can we reasonably suppose the earnest framers of it intend in these phrases an immediatedenial of the thing a moment ago declared ? This would be a reduction of dogma de fidei to absurdity andp231so must be a misreading . But there is no absurdity if you take it as obiter dictum , a timely serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery , against unsanctioned dogmatic determiningsof how the consecrated elements become what they become . Not a word calls in question the mystery itself or profuses any doubt that the elements are the Body , are the Blood . In calling these exercises casuistry I have no pejorativeintention . I see the Confraternity 's lines of close reasoning as casuistic only in the literal technical sense . They aim not at tricking and deceiving , but at fine distinguishingsbetween the good of truth and the bad of error , at right interpretation difficult to make in issues ( to the Associates ) supremely important . It will be evidentthat I am bewildered when I try to imagine how such issues ever can come to be of supreme importance to anyone . I do not mean that I 'm bewildered as to why I 'm bewildered . That is plain . I lack the believer 's temperamentjust as I lack the writer 's temperament .

Not unlike Elaine offered my suggestions regarding her mother 's interval of aberration , I find myself , when religious experience is reported to me , saying to myself something very similar to : My eye !

Hath he not hands ,  |p232organs  , dimensions , senses , affections , passions ? Fed with the same food , hurt with the same weapons , subject to the same diseases  --  well , now , how on earth does he get that way ? In this state of entire bafflement I am driven to suppose that faith , as many zealots allege , is had through grace only . What is grace need not be quibbled over . Grace will do as a name for whatever implants and nurtures faith , for thought-shaping dictates which the mind receives from somewhere , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen as not only hearing a different drummerbut even marching in a different country . To account for it , the belief , and him , the believer , this is the best I seem able to do . Lacking grace I can not know grace and consequently can not come at true causes of religious behavior . Without an indwelling of the Holy Spirit , where believers see , I am blind , where believers hear , I am deaf . My obfuscation , I must suspect , results from what Cardinal Newman in speaking of the matter once soberly called : Straight-forward , ignorant , commonsense . There is evidence clinically demonstrable that coadjutorsof faith can be metabolic changes brought about by persistent spiritual exercises , ' starvings , physical tormentings , self-hypnotizings , but with my deafness and blindness am I in a position to insist that grace can be nothing else ? It is well known that a perfect preconditioningfor mystic states may be got by taking mushroom or mold extracts , by using mescaline , bufotenine , or psilocybin , but does my well knowing thisp233license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what grace is ? These points noted , let us return to that so ardent Associateof the Confraternity , Judith 's father . Persuaded though I am that principles and practices of his faith had effects on his daughter as a child later to trigger bouts of psychopathic conduct , I can not view Canon Conway or them with the indignation one might feel if he could be shown to have worked his harm for his selfish satisfaction , intent at any cost on spiritual titillations , ruthless in pampering his emotions and never mind what damage might be done others . I do n't think it was that way at all . I doubt if it often is . The true believerlies too clearly under compulsion  --  like the psychopath , he can do no other . Helps to faith enter as masters , not servants . The spiritual exercises use the spiritualexerciser . The mescaline uses , imposes mysticism on , the mescaline taker . In the Canon 's case I ca n't recall seeing ( or hearing of ) any parts of his practice that could suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was determined by settled conviction ( so unimaginableto the unbeliever ) that simple reason prescribedboth principles and practice . When he has satisfiedhimself that certain things  --  the mighty acts of God that constitute the apostolic gospel  --  are true beyondquestion , a reasonable being must treat them as true  --  that is , conduct himself accordingly . When with music and incense he knelt to adore  --  Adoration servicesfinally made an appearance at St. George 's , but only in the last years of his life  --  the Real Presence un/der glass in the gilt-rayed monstrance I doubt if Canon Conway ever did so in ecstasy , in attained union with the Infinite . On the contrary ; here , as one of the accompanyinganthems put it , types and shadows have their ending . He could take in all literalness God to be among those present . With God 's attributes , His kingdom , His power , and His glory , God was that He was . Could a rational man be in two minds about a need to honor Him and do Him homage ? If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way about belief , his helps were unlikely to have been those afforded by spiritual exercises or mystical states however induced . In others , the enabling metabolic changes might have to be brought about by prayers , fastings , ecstasies . In him , I think none of that was necessary for the good reason that congenital endocrine disturbance or deficiency had provided of itself both physiological and psychological preconditioning enough to make him a true believer . In his recourse a little late to de-facto celibacy Canon Conway could be regarded as having simply taken a logical further step in that copying of Rome by which the Confraternity sought to restore the church 's heritage . He could tolerably represent this as his reason for believinga rule of chastity incumbent on him , but I must doubt if his obedience entailed much active mortificationof the flesh . I must suspect that from puberty on he had found women as women physically repellent . As in the persons of all females , in the person of Judith 's mother he would keep encountering with constant faint disgust grossnesses of muliebrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetite . Observing his newp235rule he would not have to struggle with temptation , or need to pray for strength to abstain . This yoke was surely easy , this burden light . Our Trinity Sunday service is over . From the sacristy Canon Conway has come around to the front of the church . In biretta and cassock ( it is too warm for his canon 's cloak ) he stations himself on the broad stone flagging beneath the stepped-out high multiple-ribbed covering arches of St. George 's cavernous shadowed portal , where he does his rector 's duty of meeting his parishioners and exchanging words of personal greeting . The stammer that he has trained himself nearly to eliminatein liturgical recitation and sermons from the pulpit becomes , when he is chatting informally , a trifle more pronounced , but he is affable and easy . Tall and big , by no means fat , yet with a certain fullness of body , he has good features , particularly the dark fine liquid eyes . A somewhat rosy complexion contrasts with prematurelywhite curly hair . To this comely appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The leaving throng of those to be spoken to keeps the Canon fully occupied , so I do not have to present myselfand my friends . I observe his daughter preparing to slip by on the other side of the wide steps . I intercept her . " Oh , hello , " she says , slightly reserved but cordial enough . Her slender figure which had come to be here and there so suggestively developed remains the same , but perhaps through her being a number of months older than when I last saw her she now exhibits no shynessabout it . The well-shaped face she turns shows a composed smile . Her suitably subdued churchgoing out/fit , black with touches of narrow white trimming , is , I observe pleased , quite smart . ( Yes , I have come a journeysince my summer days on the beach with Mrs. Van den Arend . ) Introducing my college friends to her I will be putting myself in the position of sponsoring her , and how agreeable to see she 's going to get by all right . " Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Mr. LeCato . . . Mr. Frothingham . . . " Offered her hand , hulking and athletic Percy Cundill takes it while giving her a warm admiring smile and , with calm relish , with facility of practice , passing his bland eyes through the covering outfit ' to those developmentsunder it . Jon LeCato wears already ( indeed , as I 've noted , he wore it at school ) his altogether unaffectedold-world manner . He bows , saying , " I 'm honored , ma'am . " His quaint Eastern Shore schooling in social form will , for him , rule out open lascivious eye exercises like Percy 's . Knox Frothingham , who takes himself seriously as a writer and in fact has contributed much to the Advocate , which he will next year edit , assumesthat air by writers so often assumed ( and got away with ) of being Somebody . Quietly consequential Knox , gracious , accepts her hand . However , both he and Jon are attracted enough to , with Percy , eagerly engageher in conversation . Surrounding her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive a greeting from Mr. Thom . He is short , perky , the competent and boring college bursar of many years ' service . He has with him his wife and his chubby ten- or eleven-year-old daughter , Charlotte . He is very cordial ( after all , I am the President 's son ) and wants to know if I am back for the summer . Mrs. Thom , cordial , too ,  |p237shakes  hands . Childlike , Charlotte , a little behind them , eyes me in a well-brought-up self-effacing grave way . She murmurs : " Good morning , Mr. Worthington . " I spoke earlier of those practices of retrospection , ordinarywith most of us , in which memory presents reenactments , pictures moments that the retrospective eye must find portentous , must see with uneasy stirrings , with dismays of surmise . They are moments for the prophetic voice  --  the one that could , but never does , speak . The composition of the presented pictures can serve to point up that disturbing wonderment of our life 's day-to-day normal unknowing . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fearful marvel when you consider that at the time you were able to foresee none of it . What was to be could then seem quite impossible . In the Trinity Sunday  --  morning tableau on St. George 's steps our collegian Hank does not know that behind him , engaged in chitchat with his friends , stands his future first wife , that before him , while her parents make themselves agreeable , silent stands his futuresecond wife . How could Canon Conway 's daughter , or little Charlotte , to whom he was Mr. Worthington , even remotelyimagine that this youth , being away at college , rarely seen and barely known , will play a large part in their lives ; and how could he imagine either of them playing any part in his ? Our Hank has no present plans to marry . What he told Percy Cundill was true . He and Miss Conway were casual acquaintances . If he gave her a thought it would be only the passing idle one he some/times gives any not outright unattractive female who is of age to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cares nothing . Unless constitutedlike his Boston decorator friend ( or possibly like Canon Conway ) such a youth as our Hank may suppose he will probably marry some girl sometime . This could conceivably be one of a number of Boston girls already met , but , as with Miss King , his serious object with them is n't matrimony , and that the girl that he marries will be one he has yet to meet is likely . In any case there is college to finish first , and what he will do next remains unsettled . Influenced by Knox Frothingham he may still decide to take up writing . Or he may decide to teach , like those forebears of his ; and by staying on in Cambridge to get a master 's degree for this possible purpose he will give himself a couple more years of not making up his mind . The fact that if what he was going to do ( in the sense of what he wanted to do ) was unknown , what he would actually come to do was undreamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to be . How could he possibly find himself deciding to work in something called The Excelsior Collection Agency , a shabby hole-in-the-wall Boston firm ? Of course , looked back on , the coming about of the impossible was perfectly simple  --  just one thing leading to another . Item : his mother 's brother , our Hank 's Uncle TimothyDodd , is a Boston banker . Item : ten years earlier a sad-looking fat funny little man named Leon Garesche undertakes to start a small bill-collection agency . Item : Mr. Garesche is so ingenuous ( or smart ? ) thatp239instead of going to a back-street money lender as you would expect , he walks perhaps timidly into the bank with which Mr. Dodd is connected and applies for , and of all things gets , a business loan . My Uncle Tim , as it happened , the application laid before him and Mr. Garesche summoned to be looked over , opposed the loan . Mr. Garesche did n't seem to him businessman enough to be a good risk , and he was n't persuaded there could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full control of policy , he was overruled ; but he was soon proved right about Mr. Garesche and the prospects of profit . Mr. Garesche never was able to get enough ahead to pay the loan off or to meet the amortizinginstallments . When the board a few years later elected Uncle Tim president of the bank and he came into full control , Mr. Garesche , you might think , would find himself out of luck . Oddly enough , he did n't . Mr. Dodd was not noted for weak-minded softheartedness , but apparently something about Mr. Garesche  --  perhapshis funniness , his pathetic incompetence  --  had an effect on him . Financially the thing was petty , no decisionof moment involved , and I do n't rule out the possibility that Uncle Tim , simply on sudden impulse , chose to use his new power to make law of his whim . Close and astute , he may have also considered the consideration that putting Mr. Garesche out of business would n't recoverthe bank 's money , while as it was at least the interestwas paid , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word Uncle Tim said that the bank would carry Mr. Garesche . This could hardly be what Mr. Garesche , asked to come and see Mr. Dodd , head of the bank now , hadp240come expecting to hear . He is overwhelmed . Tears fill his eyes . He calls down blessings on Mr. Dodd and on the bank . Mr. Dodd is his savior and , while he trusts soon to repay the money , the debt of gratitude he can never repay . This role of savior accorded my Uncle Tim naturally allows him to offer advice that will surely be taken and to give practical directions about the running of the business . When Mr. Garesche 's assistant ( his only other employee was a middle-aged woman stenographer ) suddenly said he was quitting , Mr. Garesche did not delay to consult Mr. Dodd . Mr. Dodd , as it happened , knew of a young man right then looking for a job . The young man was without experience in businessbut he had an excellent education . He was a college graduate with an M.A. degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been shown what it was . Mr. Garesche next learns the job seeker is no less than a nephew of Mr. Dodd 's . Almost rapturous , he loads Mr. Dodd with thanks . Here would without a doubt be the perfect person to assist him . But how on earth , we may ask , does the excellently educated nephew come to be looking for such a job ? The last we heard , he might be going to take up teaching , or he might be going to try to be a writer . Here we seem to face one of those minor mysteries of personal history  --  like the lost reasons for a Professor Dodd 's semispurious medical degree , like the determining factorsof fact in a Mrs. Van den Arend 's relation to her husband , like my Elaine 's insufficiently explained severalmarryings . However , in this particular odd state of affairs I need not be left at loss or resort to guessing . Afterthe last-we-heard , our Hank had duly taken thatp241easiest way ( a couple more years of not quite making up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M.A. in English . That got , there would be no trouble about a teaching job . If he wished to apply , his father 's college , where a bit of nepotism in appointments was traditional , would at once have found a reasonably good place for him . With his exhibited inclination toward easiest ways , a so-applyingmight seem foregone  --  and no doubt would have been if intervening developments had n't happened to make the place that was his for the asking a place he did not feel free to accept . To anyone resolved on teaching as a career , the ruling out of that particular place could be of no moment . Prepared as I was , plenty of other teaching positions would be open to me , and not very hard to find . To someone with no real interest in teaching , having the finding look hard at all may bring him to drop the whole idea . At the same time , my other idea , of writing , which for a while really had interested me in a way the idea of teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During my last college years I was kept writing chiefly by Knox Frothingham 's precepts and example . Knox simply assumed that his friend Hank , like himself , was and would be a writer . It never seemed to occur to Knox , and it occurred only slowly to me , that necessary aptitudeor talent was not come by just through wishing to be a writer or deciding to be one . People with small aptitude and no talent through doggedly writing may now and then make themselves professional writers , but the common experience will usually be that those interested in writing ' brought by their attempts top242write to realize they lack aptitude or talent quickly lose their interest . The interest Knox had been able to keep alive in our Hank went less to the work of writing than to being A Writer , to the charter to give himself Knox 's airs of intellectual and aesthetic superiority . The impracticableness of that aspiration , of acting the writer without doing much writing , must grow apparent . Naturally here , too , developments ' had been intervening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knox Frothingham 's influence . Graduated , Knox had been able to find himself , starting in the fall , an editorialjob on a New York weekly magazine . The long constant association in college literary circles , the PoetryClub , the Advocate board chamber , and , that final year , rooming together in Westmorly was over . Anotherof the developments can be seen as coming , perhapscomically , from what was Knox 's last effective exercisein precept and example . This had been to persuadehis friend Hank to attend with him , that summer after graduation , a Writers Conference . ' Conferences of the kind , today so common , numerous , and often boringlystereotyped , were then a new thing , firing intellectualexcitement and conferring intellectual prestige on those attending . Our Hank would have a fine chance to act for a couple of weeks the writer he still retained his interest of sorts in being or trying to be . The general practice then as now was to have the gathered groups of conferees led ' by a staff of professionalwriters , successful in the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as a rule never to be ( I intend no individual disparagement ; as I notedp243earlier , luck , not merit , is here determining ) , sufficiently successful to have no need for a little extra money and no time to waste this way . However , to see that fact of the matter the eager conferees must be older and more experienced than most of them were and they present themselves ready to look with awe on people listed in Who 's Who ( they do n't understand that publishing a couple of books gets anyone listed , while men of much greater public importance may wait half a lifetime ) , whose names were to be seen in literary columns and on bound volumes for sale in bookstores . Arriving with Knox to register , our Hank is as impressedas anyone else . How exhilarating to join so easily an intellectual elite ! This is the life ! Yet as business gets under way , as the program of addresses , lectures , sessions of round-table talk proceeds , he is surprised and puzzled to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not what he had been expecting . He had supposed that how to write was what they would study and discuss . Topics leaders and their led were choosing to treat often seemed quite unconnected with writing , whether as trade or as art , or with literature . Surely it 's a bit queer ? I think the question was then a fair one , though presentlysuch non-writing businesses would become the accepted thing , the whole purpose of gatherings of writersand would-be writers . Not many years later a pretentiouslynamed American Writers Congress would be centeringits whole attention on how an abstract entity known as The Writer ' ought to regard multitudinous intellectual issues ' with which modern times supposedly confronted him . No bones were made about a writerp244being purely hawker of wares . His writing , whether fiction or nonfiction , is to serve as a weapon of persuasion , an exercise in tendentious dialectics , an instrument of calculated propaganda . The right use and whole purpose of prose composition ( and indeed also of poetry ) is to plug ideologies , to sell partisan dogma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The congress men and women ( self-elected ) appear to take their seats already agreed , most of them , that the convocation'sfirst task is to frame and promulgate a lengthy Literary Manifesto . Definitive Bill of Rights &; Wrongs , this will declare once and for all what position ' everyone who writes ought to ( must ) take on every world and national social or economic problem of the day . Such full-blown solemn-asininity lay in the future ; yet first winds of it , perplexing , question-raising , trouble a little the earlier intellectual symposium 's calm . A butyricwhiff of riper phoninesses to come taints ever so faintly the rare atmosphere . Time had not been yet for main business to turn altogether from writing and becomeissues ' and problems ' ; yet a number of the leaders and not a few of the led seemed , that long-ago summer , interested more in sounding off on the innocence of Sacco and Vanzetti than in the techniques of writing truthfully and exactly about life and people . ( Did n't Doctor Johnson say : Nothing can please many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature ? ) The relevance of the case of dragged-out controversy in the Massachusetts courts to the work of would-be writers was n't and is n't very clear . However , I think I would perhaps do well to note in  |p245truth  's interest that his questioning of this particular unexpected concern of the conference did not mean that our Hank was n't , like most professional intellectualliberals , or most young and shallow ones , by and large convinced  --  proving , no doubt , what writers as colporteurs really can accomplish  --  that those to become the fire-shirted martyrs before summer ended were saintly victims of a monstrous miscarriage of justice , and this I regard as doing credit to his humane feelings , in which I have to see our Hank often deficient . By then the pileup of published liberal protest had so far buried all original facts that even the cruel irony now informing the protracted ordeal went unrecognized . Ingenuously misled by the defendants ' unshakablefirmness in protesting innocence , an impassioned liberal volunteer defense had itself , with no other help , worked its heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sport ; yet I think a qualm can be felt when those hoist are , in the law 's sense , just his next friends . None of the volunteer engineers seemed able to understand the anarchistic ethic of ends justifying means that made acts in the cause 's interest no crime , and could leave the defendantsin their own minds honestly innocent of crime . The engineers persuaded themselves that the pleas of innocencemeant that what the humble two good men were charged with they had n't done . Out of nothing but this ingenuous persuasion they contrived , where the Commonwealth 's case had every chance of failing , to convince a jury of guilt beyond reasonable doubt and subsequently to bring dismissal of appeals and to lead the extraordinary high commission of review providedp246by the Commonwealth ( yes ; Massachusetts , in supererogationof scrupulosity , there she stands ) to decide against the defendants . Much of the prosecution 's evidence was flimsy or could easily be made to look so . One solid bit rested on the ballistic tests said to prove the bullet that killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that the whole case was a capitalist plot to judicially murder innocent men for their political opinions , you knew those tests had to have been rigged . How to show they were ? Let 's have new tests conducted where they can be checked on . The cartridge that contained the bullet was of an obsolete type and did n't exactly fit the revolver . The thing was plain as day . All the bullet scoringsreally showed was the misfit . They could have been made by any revolver the cartridge did n't quite fit . Let 's get a supply of these cartridges and make other test firings . Those tests , so certain to be conclusive in disproof , the defense was unable to make . Protracted search throughout the country turned up not a cartridge of the type . The engineers had definitely determined , for the jury 's information , that there were n't any anywhere  --  none , that is , except the pocketful Sacco had when arrested . But , as to most people , to our Hank this defense gift to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or burning ) point was not known , passed overlooked , and he sufficiently sympathized with those agitatingthe cause of the moment , even if he wondered why they should be doing it here . Such random deviationsinto businesses other than writing perplex rather than disturb him . What slowly does begin to disturbp247him are some of his fellow conferees and some of their leaders . He notices the very noticeable fact ( he would prefer not to descend to personalities ; but , here , how hard to help it ! ) that a number of those present fall almostgenerically into type. ;  --  the lank and the flat-chested women's-college liberal , looking rather unwashed and rather debauched ; the pompous , obstinately humorless revolutionary young man sprouting his bit of beard , yet in his nervous giggle less than virile ; the craggy-faced , homespun , virile-indeed buck-fairy on his prowl for boy-does ( also sure to be around ) . Even a few such look-and-act-alikes viewed grouped together can suggest an imitating , a copying of each other  --  which can in turn suggest ( maybe not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real writing writers . My calling attention to generic conference types may , I see , create an impression of the quality of that yearsagosummer gathering and of the honesty of those attendingthat would be both unjust and untrue . To be kept in mind is the newness of the whole concept , the necessarily experimental nature of the agenda , the often extemporized untried and untested methods . Moreover , while quite noticeably present , the generic types were really not there in force , were nothing like a majority . Full-scale musterings of them waited on later-date convocationssuch as that farcical Congress ' of the ' 3o 's . There the generic types , the more puzzleheaded social activists , ' and all those human oddities once named by Max Beerbohm adults of the infantile persuasion swarmed so numerous that , dominant , they were soon seized of control , magisterially running the close-toburlesqueshow , and doing all the fatuous talking forp248what would be the affair 's official record . Indeed , that at our Hank 's conference this was n't the case is part of the point I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give him anxious pause , the pretended-writer or doctrinaire-critic suspects need n't be numerous . I must wonder if the fact does n't show that , while in his own outward appearance , in what he does and says , he may little resemble the pretenders present , our Hank is not secure in his difference . The show of even a few of their stamp may be judged to speak disturbingly to subliminal doubts of his about his own talent , about whether he , either , has it in him to be a real writer . Is he finding , through watching these people , himself exposed to himself ? How can he be sure he is n't what so many of them seem to him to be ? Iias he a single good reason to believe , if he keeps on writing , he can make himself anything more than they are ? The questionsshake him ; and , shaken , he may begin to realize that by asking themselves they are answering themselves . The inner doubt gives proof positive that , as well as in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperament a writer who is seriousabout writing has to have . The temperament is one you must be born with ; you ca n't cultivate or develop it ; and if our Hank wonderswhat signs of being born with it are , he need only look at his friend Knox . At the conference Knox is not failing to see the same things , and he , too , was certainlyexpecting something else , but his seeing does n't have the same effect on him . Shaken by no self-distrust , he accepts untroubled , at once perceives as only natural , the straggle of nuts and queers that creative arts mustp249always attract . He is not disturbed by what the pretenders , the half-writers , may do or be like . Sure ; the instructionof fools , of the pundits of the little cash-poor magazines , of the radical mouthy doyens of the smallfeesophomore circuit , will be folly  --  but what the hell else could it be ? And what does it have to do with seriouswriting , with himself as a writer ? Egoistically sanguineand confident , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for unkind laughs ; and once he is sure that staying in their company offers nothing from which he can profit , nothing to his writing purpose , he drops out . By temperament he is concerned with himself only , and how to express himself . Even if stridulent instruction of the fools turns directly on him and his work ( which , should he begin to be successful and celebrated , must be expected ; after all , these are self-defense 's , self-preservation 's envious gashes ) , his born-writer 's temperament is a sevenfold shield . He can be hardly pricked to more than flashes of ire '  --  like my grandfather when his critics heaped their rancorousmotivated abuse on him . The truth in one 's heart , we are told , does not fear the lie on another 's tongue . Nor is that all the temperament can do for those who possess it . Possessing it will not , of course , mean that you are bound to become a noted writer , successful and celebrated , yet it seems nonetheless to remain faithfullyyours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joining his New York magazine and doing , to start , bits of editing and staff writing , he apparently , continuingwith it , was able to find in the work adequate means of self-expression , and as time passed and he grew very accomplished , moving up to the editorial top , alsop250adequate means of livelihood . The great novel he had a youthful aim to write remains unwritten , and though finally ( he is my age ) now made a member of the NationalInstitute of Arts and Letters he enjoys no generalliterary reputation . Still , he has assured means and authority to write and to cause to be published whatever he wants to write in whatever way he wants to write it . Today I see him touched no more by sense of failure than he would have been by the abusive criticismwhich at some stage he must almost certainly need to support had he produced his great novel and had luck made it a great success . How very clear that this temperament is not our uncertain Hank 's ! He is fortunate in so soon realizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write . Here is how , at least as seen by me today , I was led  --  things led me  --  not to teach , although I had prepared myself to , and also not to try to be the writer I had through several young years fancied I would like to be . All quite simple , the course of events not in the least unaccountable  --  one thing indeed leads in all logic to another , and exactly the same may be said for my employmentwith Mr. Garesche . Steered by intervening developments there , too , one thing simply and naturallyled to one more thing until the unlikely outcome became the outcome to be expected  --  at least , viewed in the light of how things then looked to me . In the matter of how things then looked to me I find again the recurring difficulty I earlier set out . When fond or not so fond recollection is restoring scenes of my pastp251to view , a large part of what I watch myself doing has the appearance of being done at random , vagariously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doubt if that was ever the case . Certainly I then had reasons , good enough for me to find them compelling ; but what they were often now eludes me ; my mind ca n't convincingly recoverthem . If they could be recovered I 've no doubt I 'd find every action today inexplicable well explained . As it is , I must admit that quite a few of recollection 's representations strike me as  --  well , lacking in plausibility . I was entertaining , I must remind myself , my ingenuousyouthful notion that being apart from one 's real life ' what work one did for a wage was unimportant . The posing , the attitude-striking that my undergraduatefriends and I had practiced with  --  today I think , how tiresome  --  sedulity persisted as a habit of my mind . This let me relish my job 's sheer inappropriateness , its utter unrelation to anything for which my schooling or upbringing fitted me , or which I might be thought likely to take up . I was able to enjoy the astonishedstare I could count on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all studied nonchalance that I was a bill collector . Practicing still that **29;9531;TOOLONG , I did honestly view as amusing ' the absurd banal employment , the cramped , mean , decrepit BoylstonStreet building office  --  more like a loft  --  to which each day ( the delicious irony of it ! ) I went , and poor , fat , drooping-mustached Mr. Garesche , and his inanity , inefficiency , and almost idiot-boy worship of Uncle Tim . In that last does a note of disaffection sound ? I 'm sure it does . While the amusing ' job well enoughp252served its purpose of providing me with a little extra income ( I received some from a trust when I came of age  --  Cuthbertson money descending divided and subdivideduntil individual beneficiaries got no more than a hundred or so dollars a month  --  nice to have , but no living ) and I owed the job to Uncle Tim , I could n't help at the same time seeing it had amounted to a cheap stale crumb rather crossly tossed me . Uncle Tim and his bank were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , had he chosen to say it , I would have been taken on there ; or , if that was at the moment impracticable , letters from him could not have failed to open doors a lot more impressive than Mr. Garesche 's . Why he chose neither to take me on nor to give me letters was n't perhaps as clear to me then as now ; yet I suppose enough of the truth about his not choosing was conveyed in his mien of displeasure for me to feel rather miffed . Clear to me now is that he had , in the first place , been rather miffed himself by my very applyingto him for help in getting a job . He was n't expecting any such thing and he did n't like it . Though I doubt if they were feelings exactly formulated , he had a general reaction of displeasure at something he saw as unsuitable , unseemly , in a nephew of his with good backgroundand proper education out looking for a job , just any job . Those hostile to the Uncle Tims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is fair to conclude that theirs is the common mistake about the Puritan tradition of which I 've spoken . Considerationsof social status or claims to place and privilege do not govern . If there is consciousness of caste , of being not as other men , with it , responsible for it , is also al/ways that consciousness of extra obligation which backgroundand upbringing impose on you , the concept of duties you must do over and above the call of other men 's duties . With my background and my upbringing I had no business , my education completed , to be at loose ends . It was most reprehensible in me . This was n't at all the way a Dodd ( or Worthington ) ought to conduct himself . In the right and reasonable order of things my occupationor employment would have been chosen with care , determined and fully planned in advance , and the plans unswervingly followed . As far as Uncle Tim knew , I was planning to be a college professor  --  very suitable , given the family background . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ token interest in me as his nephew . His habit was to recognize the relationshipat intervals of three or four months by a note that summoned me to the Somerset Club for luncheon . With yes-sirs and no-sirs I gave formal answers to formal questionsabout how I was getting on ' ( and ate an expensive lunch ) . This had led him to suppose I was getting on well , and that all was going as it ought to go . And now what happens ? Lo and behold , just before I am to leave Cambridge , my planned work done , and move on to the instructor 's job ready for me , I turn up at the banking rooms , send in my name , and proceed , if you please , to tell Uncle Tim I 've dropped the whole idea of teaching . Then what do I mean to do ? ( In the tradition you eat bread in the sweat of your face and no other way . ) I say I do n't know but I 've got engaged to a girl and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he happens to hear of any possible openingsp254for me I 'd greatly appreciate his giving me letters of introduction . How this display , casual and open , of what the traditionsaw as fecklessness and irresponsibility would be bound to strike Uncle Tim is now so obvious to me I find it hard to believe I never saw it then ; but of course the imperception of inexperience can be amazing . To Uncle Tim the calm brash announcement of dereliction from duty was impious and impudent . My effrontery in coming to him was unparalleled , and my offense was naturally aggravated by my whole spirit or attitude which , being proud of it , I was n't concealing . My stance of nonchalance ( so much rehearsed ) would convey to him quite convincingly the truth that I looked on a job , work , as trivial and tiresome , that I despised industry and application , and that any idea of something accomplishedsomething done to earn a night 's repose was too absurd . Uncle Tim 's own bank had no place or use for a silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those solid firms of sound principle where a letter from Uncle Tim might get him taken on would amount to a breach of trust in business ethics  --  unthinkable . However , in Mr. Garesche 's seedy business what a young ass did would n't matter , and I 'd shown out of my own mouth that I deserved no more , or better . Able to look at it this way , the way I 'm sure it looked to Uncle Tim , I must conclude he possessed himself with a patience or restraint earning high marks . He never even said : Do n't give yourself airs . He never said : D' you think I can listenall day to such stuff ? Be off or I 'll kick you downstairs ! What he did say was : I have a man who 's tryingp255to find an assistant . It 's not much of a job but it would pay you something . If you like , I 'll speak to him . With chilly look and cold touch of hand he has me ushered out . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could then miff me a little ; yet in fact Uncle Tim was showing , greatly to his **25;9562;TOOLONG credit , that he could so far conquerdispleasure ( and perhaps disgust at my posturings ) as to treat me with consideration I did n't deserve . By that good luck of mine , Uncle Tim being Uncle Tim , he must require himself to do at least something for his sister 's son . I may also reflect that having the job he tossed me not one of the better '  --  that is , more impressiveand reputable  --  jobs in his gift or power could have been further good luck . To show myself how amusing ' one of those was might have been harder ; and furthermorethe better ' job would probably have proved in practice a good deal greater bore . To tell the truth , my routine of sending out dunning letters was not long in coming to seem , if unavowably , quite fun . I 'm sure I 've made plain before now that our Hank has his full human share of unappealing traits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaknessesand failings , recurring petty meannesses of head and heart . Under Mr. Garesche the bully 's low-down pleasure of power becomes his . Every business day he sets himself to , in effect , hale before him a couple of dozen wretched delinquents . Crisply he admonishes them . Grimly he directs them to mend their evil ways . By form letters  --  a succession of seven graduated in ever-rising severity and ominousness of language ( ap256friendly reminder ... If there is any reasona part payment on . . . Final notice )  --  they are badgeredand threatened . Whether or not anything much to Mr. Garesche 's business purpose results he can feel sure few of those addressed are unworried as they read down to the subjoined firm H. D. Worthington . More than one may worry himself sick about what H. D. Worthington is planning to do next . Another part of the office work , skip-tracing , is mostly carried on through always shady smalltime private detectiveagencies who have ill-organized scatterings of alwaysshady smalltime agents and correspondents around the country ; but even here H. D. Worthington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hounds , is manifestly , he can feel , no man to trifle with . ( I will speak later of an incidental side line among the office 's assorted irregular businesses to be ironically of first and greatest importance in shaping our Hank 's future , but which he did not then work on  --  it was a mail-order operation which Mr. Garesche 's Amy , ' a dowdy , dumpy Mrs. Pollock , morose in the menopause , was given to handle . ) So here in Mr. Garesche 's dilapidated and musty office , doing ( a trifle sadistically ) his rather sordid duties , we see sitting the young professorial dropout , the writer manque . I have reviewed the circumstances of his coming there  --  the manner of its coming to happen . Let us look at why it happened . I told how , nonchalant , our Hank in his casual announcement to Uncle Tim makes mention of a girl to whom he is engaged . He speaks as though this were merely by the way . Onp257the contrary . She has decided to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  is actually the whole , the only , reason for the remiss nephew being at the loose ends that shock Uncle Tim , for his coming to Uncle Tim in search of some job , any job . True , the girl can not be held responsible for his decidingnot to try to write , but she is entirely responsible for his not being able to take the one teaching position he need n't exert himself in the least to get , and consequentlyfor his abandoning the idea ( less than eagerly entertained ) of teaching . The girl will not agree to go up to his father 's college and live on the campus , and this is not merely because she prefers Boston to a small college town , or is unwilling to drop the art-school courses she came to Boston to attend . She happens to be none other than Canon Conway 's daughter , Judith . Interveningdevelopments have occurred in her history , too . Through them , getting away from her disliked home suddenly becomes possible . Nothing in the world would induce her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I consider just how Judith 's escape was made possible I have to come again to that marveling pause of the mind 's vain surmise at the inconceptible , inapprehensiblenature ( looked at from any given present ) of many events of things future . Quite confounded , a little apprehensive , one must note the extreme likelihoodof the unlikely , the high incidence of the altogetherunthought of or of the apparently impossible in what falls out next . Here the unlikely , the unthought of , the apparently impossible , as it comes to affect JudithConway ( and , so , me ) gets its start on an April dayp258of the year our Hank , in Cambridge , will graduate from college . In California on that day the death , by science made lingering , of a senile cancer victim of eighty-four is at last died , and a first note of the bizarre , the improbable , sounds perhaps in the old man 's name . His name is Obadiah Love . Our Hank has never seen or heard of him . They are not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this taking-off , and how it ( any more than the day 's uncountedother takings-off here or there ) could bear on his future or fortunes is hard to imagine . The crucial event has now accomplished itself but at a great distance , so those to be affected do n't know anything of it and wo n't for months . A last will and testament of Obadiah Love presented for probate by the executors disappears , conveyed into vast mills of the law which , if they grind fine , grind exceeding slow . All hidden , all unsuspected by persons whose lives they are about to revolutionize , the events of the thing proceed , inch on through mazes of technicalities in what is to end by proving , though it is still impossible to see how , our Hank 's direction . He , across the continent in Cambridge , goes about his senior-year late-spring businesses . Commencement is approaching , and while final examinations are yet to be taken he is not worried . He is well up in his subjects , and even if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of receiving one of the year 's thousand A.P . diplomas dealt out during the solemn mass ceremony which is made tedious by the courtly insistence of President Lowell that winning a Harvard diploma 's distinction shall be sustained by his putting it , per/sonally , into each winner 's hand ( and he will be long arriving at Worthington ' ) . Unweighed on by examinationanxieties , our Hank 's mind is free to engage itself with thoughts , sententious and close to sentimental , of an era or epoch over , a chapter ended , a reached partingof the ways in which those he has come to know , his friends of years  --  to him , this means not the calendar count of four , but the term of his whole lifetime as an out-of-school adult  --  are scattered far and wide . Of course , he will return in the fall to do graduate work , but that wo n't be the same ; the life he begins will be a new one . Meanwhile , he has the interval of a summer , which still seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early weeks he spends , as I have related , with Knox Frothingham at the Writers Conference . My relation is misleading if it suggested that his experience made him then and there , once and for all , decide that writing was not for him . He had begun with Knox 's encouragement to work on a novel in the spring , and in a way at Knox 's demand  --  Knox , suffering no ill effects from the conference 's fatuity , had parted from him saying with friendly sternness : Now , Hank , get the hell ahead with " Sop to Cerberus " ( for so the novel was tentatively titled ) ; do n't go half-assing around all summer  --  he continues his work , though with lessenedassurance , at the Old Harbor house through the weeks of July . In residence are his mother and his Grandfather Dodd , who , relegated to professor emeritus but by no means Cubby ' yet , keeps busy with papers on his ESP studies . Thus the typewriters tap togethermornings , our Hank 's in his bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His father will not bep260down until August . This year the college is for the first time experimenting with a four-week session of summer school , and a Chaucer course would be just the thing to offer seekers of extra credits . Restless in a way new to him our Hank finds it all somehow insipid , vapid  --  his gentle mother 's gentle social routines ; his own halfhearted morning work ; his grandfather 's long-windedness ; and the scant availablecompanionship . None of the people he used to know seems to be at Old Harbor this summer . The Van den Arend house is sold . New owners , named Park , prove to have three daughters all old enough to be of interest  --  noneof them what was then described as a knockout , but they are not too bad-looking . However , the circumstance of his never having met them before , and of there being three of them , presents difficulties . A long , long time will be needed for him to get on terms familiar enough for him to detach one from her sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descends the steps to the beach and finds them on the sand near the adjoining steps  --  just where Mrs. Van den Arend used to sit  --  they cordially make much of him , but for the present it has to be with all three that he goes swimming or walks up to the point . The **30;9589;TOOLONG sentiments in which he indulged himself at Cambridge through late May led to an agreement to come and spend August at the extraordinary rococo sort of castle ' in the ThousandIslands that Percy Cundill 's parents own , and our Hank is glad or at least relieved to get away from Old Harbor , " Sop to Cerberus , " and the Misses Park . Pleasantlyregretful in the remembrance that the best ofp261friends must part , must part ( Percy enters the family New York brokerage house in the fall . He does so , he says , because he 's expected to , and with reluctance ; but in fact this doing of the expected was a doing of just what he had natural aptitude for ) , our Hank and Percy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Percy 's parentsare in Europe  --  and comradely few final ' nonchalant ' weeks . They race express cruisers around , patronizeAlexandria Bay speak-easies to which any amount of good Canadian booze is ferried daily , and with studied condescension turn up tight to just the fashionable degreeat yacht-club dances , where in slow motion to strains of " The Birth of the Blues " they can , as it was then called , knee ( you worked a leg solidly between hers ) sun-tanned , firmly round-limbed , mostly smalltimeheiresses of the summer colony  --  but that was all . Possibly influenced by conservative Ontario across the water , Alexandria Bay , quaint as it seemed , had chaperoneddances . When the band struck up " Home , Sweet Home " that was it . Vigilantly checked on , the club dancers went home to bed . You had to look elsewherefor dates to bring aboard an express cruiser in which you sped away to some placid private cove and out of the current , engines off , settled down with a bottle of King William IV to a starlit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself and my long-ago friends ? Do I detect a jeering tone in this recount of the summer 's activities ? Do I resent the embarrassment that Hank , young , is causing Hank , old , and so try to punish him nunc pro tunc for his now unaccountable be/havior ? I only know that , looking back , thinking of Percy Cundill I find myself reflecting that the likelihoodof the unlikely , so important to allow for in projectionsof the future , may ( in its shape of the hard to believe ) also need to be allowed for in the remembered past . What , I must ask myself , could be less likely than Percy Cundill 's being a close friend of college mates like Knox and Jon and me ? By a chance of dormitory assignment  --  they had never met before  --  he and Knox roomed together in Gore Hall their freshman year , and you would have expected that at the end of it they would part for good . Their very appearance must suggest they could have nothing in common . Knox Frothingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been nicknamed Ink ' in his childhood . Percy was strapping and stalwart , with an open , pleasant , cheerfully unintellectualface and bright blond crew-cut hair . The crew cut was appropriate because Percy had preparedat Kent , one of that day 's relatively few rowing schools . His sixth-form year he stroked the Kent crew , and he went right on rowing . He stroked the freshman crew , and for three years on the varsity rowed number five , an oar which for reasons I do n't know enough about rowing to understand seems in most boatings to be given if possible more than average muscle . He studiedlittle and kept himself in college , or at least kept himself eligible to represent the college athletically , only through Widow ' Nolan 's tutoring classes . You would think he could n't possibly share the interests , consciously intellectual , carefully uncollegiate , Knox shared with Jon and me.  |p263Yet  to think that is to forget the less than kindly law by which our human condition or nature seems to provide that most of us at least part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically or mentally , by temperament or by training , we are least fitted to be . In obedience to it , Percy between workouts in the rowingtank or on the river persisted in writing verses . They were of appalling ineptitude , and even the Advocate , where we his friends soon came to have influence , was obliged to turn them down . Percy took rejection in good part and oddly undiscouraged was soon with all ineptness preparing new submissions . I can not doubt that this unlikely ( and vain ) aspiration was what kept him wanting the pleasure of our intellectual company and close companionship . We , his ill-sorting friends , were naturally not without our aspirings , private , secret , perhaps even to a degree unconscious . College sports were disdained by us as puerile rah-rah inanity ( ' Gainst the line of Crimson , Yale ca n't prevail  --  now , for God 's sake ! ) but behind this front of amused disdain lurked , I think , the unsettlingawareness that there was no varsity team that any of us would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance of making . Patronizing , we took care in a friendly way to kid Percy a little about dying for dear old Harvard , but I feel sure that if you really got down to it not one of us , and probably not one of the others , quite a number , assuming our pose of patronage , would n't have relished the right to wear during summervacations that casually bedraggled soft white crew hat bearing a crimson H of Percy 's . I ca n't doubt thatp264we , all of us , were inwardly flattered to have Percy for familiar friend , to have him give us rather than his athleticpeers the pleasure of his company . The earth turns . August on the great river ends . Over in the Ontario woods trees are starting to show fall color . The final yacht-club dance of the season concludes to a syncopating of " Auld Lang Syne . " Aboard the expresscruiser floating in the private cove the air of deep night chills you . People are closing up the island houses . The time of play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Hank is back in Cambridge to begin his graduate studies . As he foresaw when the college year was drawing to a close last spring , it is not the same , and his familiarity with the scene can only intensify that sense of everyone gone , strengthen the it's-all-overnowfeeling that with soft melancholy tempers haze of early-autumn-morning sunlight , wafted smoke of twilightleaf fires in the Yard . He knows a few other graduatestudents to speak to , but he knows well only Jon LeCato , who is back , too , sharing with him pleasant rooms they had arranged to take in a Chauncy Street apartment house . ( He can not guess that the California mills of probate are grinding on , and a schedule of distributionof the Obadiah Love estate nears the making . ) Jon is back to enter Harvard Law School . He enters , yes ; but before first semester 's end , discontent , he will quit . In those days it was anticipated that one out of every three Law School matriculants , finding the work load too heavy , wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't Jon 's trouble . As October becomes Novemberhe is finding the case system , with its **27;9621;TOOLONG of learning by doing , a needless waste of time  --  not enough , rather than too much , work . He soon feels certain he would learn law faster if he were his own instructor and course-planner . Jon presents himself to the Dean and explains . The Dean must have been nonplused indeed . With what transcendent impudence does a youth barely into his twenties by implication charge on this most august institution , the first among law schools , inadequate , incompetent teaching ? Can the Dean believe his ears ? Jon , as I have before suggested , never fails to be intransigently Jon , and the Dean must soon consent to believe them . Moreover , for Jon perhaps fortunately , Harvard is still A. Lawrence Lowell 's university and no one gainsays him . Dear to President Lowell 's heart is every phase of academic freedom , whether in teaching or in learning . The Dean , whatever he may have felt and no matter what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed status of a special student working on his own for credits toward a degree . He is granted full use of the library and all data services and facilities . He is made free to do it his way if he can . ( Jon can . Reading in Langdell from opening to closing by himselfhe will come to take his examinations and be admitted to the bar almost a year before those who were his Law School classmates receive their LL.B. ' s  --  with bar examinations still to be passed . ) The university terms end . Our Hank and this prodigy of a Jon go to Europe together , working their way on a cattle boat  --  another period touch  --  for some cultural grand touring to which they add wining and a little desultory wenching in the American-overrun cafe-Parisp266of those years . One cattle-boat trip they had found quite enough . They return tourist class on the old Carmania . This lets them encounter a young artist , a former Radcliffegirl Jon had known for the reason that she came of an Accomack County family long neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art school . Her name is Doris Kendall . Tall , blonde , markedly good-looking in a rather hard-faced way , she wears open-collar men 's shirts , and , often , jodhpurs , and a soft fedora hat . The surprising fact is that our Hank , sophisticated though he seems to himself to be , makes nothing of all this . He is much taken by her blase manner and her spirited and unconventional behavior  --  loftily brazening it out , she has them spending almost all their time not down in tourist but in the ship 's more comfortable cabin-class areas  --  and he will as soon as he is back in Cambridge be around to the art school 's Marlborough Street studio building in which she lives . You can hardly believe it , but he thinks that if he takes her to dinner at Locke-Ober'sa few times he 'll get somewhere with her . On the morning of the last day of August the Carmaniadocks in New York . On that same morning a legal-lookingenvelope from California arrives by registeredmail at the rectory of St. George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The envelope opened , he reads fairly stunned that he is a named beneficiary in the last will and testament of one Odadiah Love deceased , the distribution of whose estate is now authorizedand ordered . Item : to my kind friend and former pastor the Reverend Canon Kenneth Ellis Conway I give , devise and bequeath the sum of . .. The sum isp267sizable , and these monies will be remitted to the Canon immediately on receipt of formal proof of identity . Seeing the name , Canon Conway can place the man , a person he had quite forgotten ; but his astonishment is hardly lessened . Thirty-odd years earlier Mr. Love had been connected in some way with the State Departmentin Washington . He regularly attended services at the cathedral . He was middle-aged , affable , and very presentable , but suggested was a background of breedingrather than of wealth . With his wife he lived in a modest nicely appointed house in Georgetown , where the Canon made prescribed pastoral calls and about once a year came to dinner . As the Canon recalled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of influenza in 1918 , which could , of course , do something to account for the will  --  the old man at this late date probably had no surviving family to whom his money could be left . Still , the bequest remained amazing . After all , Mr. Love 's kind friend ' was never that in any close or intimatesense . For a few years they were cordial social acquaintances . Then , after the Canon left Washington , for a few years more Mr. Love was among the Canon 's chess-by-mail partners . In due course , with new occupationsand interests , they corresponded less and less . For a long time now neither had heard from the other . Mr. Love 's leaving him a legacy was the last thing in the world his former pastor ' would think of expecting . But , identity established , here is Canon Conway in sudden receipt of many thousand undreamed-of dollars . What will he do with them ? Thanks to **28;9650;TOOLONG his stipend at St. George 's ( thoughp268sadly diminished in purchasing power by constant monetary inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( except in church ritual . Be sure the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament will soon liberally benefit ) . He feels not the least inclination to lay money out on living comforts or luxuries that might until now have been beyond his means . But he will be able to do something he would like to do , always until now a little beyond his means , for someone else . In speaking critically of the Canon 's treatment of his daughter I nonetheless meant to make it clear that nothing I saw ( and nothing she told me of ) showed the least harshness or intentional unkindness . The wish that she did not exist seems always to have been of a penitential sort . The fault is his fault , his own fault , his own most grievous fault ( in no way hers ) , and he does penance in a labored practice of fatherliness . ' If Judith is undeceivedby it , intuitively aware of the wish and bitter , she ca n't say he does n't try . He is deliberately , determinedly kind toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of guilt would be eased if she is out of his sight ) , the unhesitating generosity , the quickness with which , now that he is able to , he furnishesher with means to do what she wants  --  get away - is by his standing intention preordained . As a school child Judith early showed a talent for drawing , an aptitude with pencil and crayons admiringlyremarked on by her teachers . When she is about fifteen her talent attracts the attention of a college facultywife who is an amateur painter , and , also admiring , she kindly helps Judith with elementary techniques in mixing color and handling a brush . Though the collegep269does not admit women , as Judith gets older a special arrangement  --  thatis , a word from my father  --  permits her to take Art Department courses , though they are not very useful to a would-be artist since there are no classes in actual drawing or painting . The kindly facultywife is the one who tells her of this school in Boston where students can board and lodge while they study . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straiten her parents ' circumstances . Feeling as she does about her father she is not going to ask such a thing . Now she does n't have to ask . Her father proposes it . He undertakes to provide her with a liberal allowance . Three weeks later , smartly outfitted , with plenty of money put in her purse , she is in Boston living in the school 's studio building . The school is , of course , Doris Kendall 's Marlborough Street school . Of this important intervening development our Hank remains quite ignorant . He and Judith Conway have known each other over a number of years , yet never so well that the natural thing would be for her to write him that she was coming to Boston or to telephone him in Cambridge when she arrived . She has been in Boston living at the school and attending her drawing and painting classes for more than a month without his knowing , though he , too , has been at the school  --  that is , in the gloomy and undusted half-library , half-receptionroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Miss Kendall to come down to be taken out on so-far fruitless dates . Ile is doing this about six o'clock on an afternoon in early November when the big street door opens and bangs closed . It has let in ,  |p270along  with a brief draft of frosty outside air , a girl in a leopard-skin coat . As she walks by the arched entrance to the low-lighted reception room she gives a casual look that way . For a moment blankly , our Hank looks back . He thinks then : Well I 'm damned ! Is n't that Judith Conway ? He immediately remembers about Judith 's art interests ; so of course it has to be she . He starts up and goes out to her . Smiling , surprised but calm , she says : Hello , Hank . What brings you here ? Meeting somebody from one 's home town in another place now has its usual effect . They shake hands with warmth . They are in an instant best friends . He asks what she 's doing . She tells him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , of course . Ca n't they have dinner one night soon ? They surely can ; name the night . Perhaps because he begins to realize his outlays on her are getting him no closer ( obtusely he still does n't see why ) to an enjoymentof Miss Kendall , he is prepared to note , and startled he does note , that the Canon 's daughter has charms of manner and expression , not to say physical attractiveness , a good deal greater than he seems to remember her having . It will turn out that he is tonight dating the impregnable Doris , with her cool slipping out of embraces anything more than tentative , her adroit fending off of caressings of the thoroughgoing kind , for the last time . I would be curious to know just when Judith reached a firm decision to marry me . I would n't then have been able to tell because in those days it never occurred top271me that the deciding was n't to be mine . I never knew that virtually all marriages are arranged by the woman  --  yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one that women generally find offensive because they seem to feel they 're made out to be fishers of men , the unprettypursuers , not the pretty pursued . Yet the very nature of the male-and-female relationship prescribes the role , determines the position . It is a trading position . ( Could unconscious sensing of that truth be what makes Elaine in her recounts of male-and-female relationshipharp again and again on deals ' ? ) The female possesses a staple in brisk male demand . To whom and on what conditions she transfers title is hers alone to decide . Does she hear a bid ? Yes , she does . Now what she must ask herself , weighing it , is whether the considerationheld out is or is not as good and valuable as any she has reasonable hope of getting if she looks further and waits longer . The thoughtful good sense shown , the provident wish ( whose sound principle is : nothing for nothing and very little for sixpence ) to act circumspectly strike me as much to the credit of feminine nature , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That women do n't as a rule allow idiot compulsions of True Love , either the besottedly romantic sort , or the carnal screw-we-must sort , to make fools of them I think praiseworthy . ( In the records of history great men all too often ruin themselves for a woman , but is there any record of a great woman ruining herself for a man ? ) How commendable the practical perspicacity that may look at marriage as a girl 's way out of a dreary home life , or as a promise of support in a style to which shep272would like to become accustomed , or even simply as means to show friends ' of hers that she must have charms and personal worth that they have long vexed her by too plainly underestimating . Whatever dictates it , if the decision reached is that on the whole the suitor to hand will do , for him a marriage has then and there been arranged . The Marlborough Street art school and studio buildingis administered by modern-thinking believers in the freedom of the individual , particularly of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they held no stuffy views and laid down no stuffy rules against anything less than open riot . To their studio with adjoining bedroomapartments women students were at liberty to bring male friends any time they liked . Thus when our Hank and Miss Conway had been out , as they often were through November , to dinner , or the theater , or a dance , she is able to ask him up and give him a drink . The drink is usually arrack , which a fellow student 's father ( a well-to-do Armenian rug dealer ) somehow could get by the gallon . Indulgent , he kept his daughtersupplied and she in turn supplied her friends . To Western taste arrack is a rather nasty drink , but so , after all , was most of the bootleg gin of the day , and you learned to take what you could get . Comes a mid-December evening when , back with her from a Symphony Hall concert , our Hank , the arrack elevating his ardor , obeys his impulses . ( Had we but world enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He finds himself rather assisted than resisted in his disrobingof Miss Conway and , when he has her without a stitch on , in bedding her . However , fruition ensuingp273though afforded him with a show of ardor of her own  --  she lowers her eyelids amorously ; her lips curve in simulatedsatisfaction as he commences his offer  --  proves sadly awkward and incomplete . This is due to Miss Conway 's being what I remember Elaine describing herself as being on her first wedding night , an intact virgin  --  something new in our Hank 's experience and , so , more than semifrustrating ; just as receiving him is something new in hers , and so she is of course inept in the mechanics , and has n't known what to do to prepare her person for it . The contretemps , with our hampered Hank reduced to ready-or-not delivery and Miss Conway checked in erotic response by the extreme discomfort caused her , may be taken as routine comedy in these circumstances and the unenjoyable occasion does not put them on bad terms . She shows an amiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get back from a date , try , try again . On his part he is treating himself to first courses of the **25;9680;TOOLONG feast of fantasy which I earlier did what I could to describe . Just as Elaine said in her recount of her introductory experiencesof the kind , with practice things sure enough do get better , and I daresay she would hear unsurprised that hers had been her mother 's experience before her . No , I do n't know at what point Judith reached her decision and a marriage was arranged . I feel fairly sure she did n't have marriage in mind when she helped on my after-the-concert first half-having of her . Again I rememberElaine 's remarks on status . Her mother , particularly in the art-school milieu , probably found being a virgin embarrassing and meant to do something aboutp274it as soon as she got a chance . The milieu doubtless provided girls to tell her how to do something about it without at the same time becoming an unwed mother . In her case at least , the counsel appeared to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by need ' to get married . Still , those commoner common-sense reasons for a girl marrying do n't here look likely . Miss Conway was already escaped from an undesirable home life . While by no means penniless , I had n't and she knew I had n't money to give her any grand-style support . For several years she must have been enjoying adequate assurance that she was attractive , so she could hardly have felt an urge to show ' anybody anything . ( I think of Elaine and the version she gives of her motives in procuring a second husband . ) Does True Love after all have to be admitted , whether in its romantic besotmentsense , or , things by now coming to go very satisfactorily , in its gross sense ? Again , I just do n't know . I do know all must have been settled when I got my M.A. degree in June . I had readily agreed not to make use of it  --  I mean , not to apply for the instructor 's job at the college , while at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with Mr. Garesche . So Judith 's decision could be implemented , and I was ( as I see now ) duly married by her before a Cambridge magistrate . No honeymoon trip seemed necessary since we had been practicing the rites of one all spring . We went at once to live in an amusing ' apartment in a divided-up house on Louisburg Square . My decorator friend had looked it out for me , and it was only a few doors from a small Anglican convent on the corner . I was at first afraid that , because of her father , this mightp275put Judith off . Not a bit ; and I can suspect that seeing it in an infantile way as blasphemous  --  Elaine 's allright-for-youfeeling ?  --  she liked secretly the idea of constant carnal knowledge had of her no very great distancein linear yards from a poor handful of brides of Christ sleeping virgin and solitary , and from the obnoxioussacrament under its hanging red light . To make the apartment amusing ' was its layout . You went down steps to a basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dining alcove , and a living room looking on a constricted strip of back-yard garden . Narrowlittle inside stairs took you up to what was the house 's ground-floor back , where you found two bedroomsand a bath . During that today rather distastefullyremembered early-years  --  well , amative  --  season , whose practices I have given some account of , this was the place to which , if we were out , we had to come back early ; or if we were home , whose little stair we did not delay to mount when that harmonious chime tells me from her that now it is bedtime.  |p276was  speaking of her experience on the dunes at Old Harbor she mentioned my absence from home in the military service . Yes ; that then-a-soldier part I have , like my father and great-grandfather before me , played in my time . Full of strange oaths ? Bearded like the pard ? Jealous in honor ? Sudden and quick in quarrel ? Seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannon 's mouth ? Well , my great-grandfather could be called bearded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly copying his friend General Burnside , who , I would judge , must have helped him to his commission . As the case is with my Dodd grandfather ( the peerlessCubby ) and his dubious medical degree , exact circumstances of this commissioning are all lost . No military background existed . My Worthington **29;9707;TOOLONG with Ambrose Burnside seems to have been merely an acquaintanceship due to their both having conducted businesses in Bristol , Rhodep277Island  --  the one his never too successful tannery and harness-making factory , the other his not very successfulfoundry and machine shop producing firearms . Certainly in my great-grandfather we have no boyvolunteer . He was born in 1823 , attended the little college to be that of his descendants ( just how this happenedI do n't know : but the rich Cuthbertsons were , after all , from Rhode Island ) , and was old enough , when he entered the Army , to have a son of his a student there  --  the son would become Professor Abdiel Worthington and my own father 's father . While this made him about Burnside 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Point behind him . I have found it of record that the harness factory had from time to time minor War Departmentcontracts in the ' 50 's ( though a good part of what was furnished seems on inspection to have been rejected ) , so perhaps there was a connection with quartermaster people in the military establishment . Still , why his services should be in request is unclear , and that they never were ' in request ' is very possible . The discoveryby late 1862 that business prospects were not , for him , improving with the war may have made an officer 's pay look attractive , so he pulled what strings he was able to pull ( General Burnside had just replaced McClellan ) to get it . On May 4 , 1864 , the Army of the Potomac , one hundred and fifty thousand strong , is set in motion . From Brandy Station the miles-long corps columns pass GermannaFord and march , battle ready , southeast ( they will become engaged in the Wilderness on the 5th ) . The railroad at Brandy Station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love what he still was ? To this question , which she pressed upon herself , she found no answer . For twenty-four hours she hung suspended in space , the great craft which contained her somehowsymbolic of her own being . Earth was invisible under a floor of white clouds , parting now and again to show a glimpse of ocean beneath , its blue matching the sky above . The routine of life continued . She ate sparingly of food lavishly offered to her , she drank a cocktail or two , and a liqueur with her coffee after dinner . She slept fitfully when darkness fell and she woke at dawn . She washed and made up her pale face and brushed her hair . And all the time she was infinitely remote , the human beings caged with her mere automatons . She smiled in answer to a smile and replied with few words to strangers ' greetings and remarks . She was nowhere , she was nothing , she was no one . She had neither past nor future , her past built upon a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went home again ? What if she disappeared ? No , she had a path planned , and she must follow it to its end . She descended in Seoul , Korea , among people all of one color , hair dark , eyes dark . Around her a language she had never heard rose and fell in waves of strange sound . She had her directions , Chris had seen to that . The name of the hotel , the street , how she was to get there after customs . It was a relief to hear that the young customs officer spoke English . " How long you are staying , madame ? "  | " I do n't know . " " Two weeks ? " " I hope not longer . " " More , you must get permission . " " I think it will not be more . " He smiled at her , his teeth very white and even . " There is much beautiful here . I hope you stay long . " She had not smiled for days , but now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " Thank you , " she said . It was not difficult , after all , if she denied herself panic . Above all , she must be calm . She chose a cab which was , as she observed , an old jeep , its sides and roof made of tin cans pounded flat and nailed together , but it was a vehicle , and the driver , a young man in a patched cotton suit , washed to a faded gray , was cheerful , though without speaking English . He recognized the name of the hotel , and while the ride there was longer than it should have been , she suspected , she arrived . The jeep stopped with a jerk , the driver sprang from his seat , hauled out her two bags , and shouted . A porter ran out of the hotel , seized the bags , and waited while she counted the taxi fare , the driver helpful in pointing out the suitable coins with his crooked little finger . Again with the flashing white-toothed smile , he hurled the jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel . Chris had anticipated her . A cable was at the desk , and the clerk knew her name . " Flowers in your room , madame , " he said . Flowers could only mean Chris again , and clutching thep69cable in the envelope in her hand she followed a sprightly bellboy to her room . Yes , there were flowers , a tight bouquetof mixed colors , without fragrance . She paid off the . boy , locked the door and opened the cable . " I am there with you , " Chris told her . " Night and day I am with you . I love you . " Suddenly she began to weep softly , she who never wept , and tears drained away the ache in her heart . Chris loved her  --  Chris was thinking of her . In a strange land , she was no longer alone . Distant though she was , she could see her home and Chris sitting , perhaps at his desk , lonely because she was not there . 0 precious home , let it never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She must be patient  --  she must forgive  --  forgive , because not to forgive is intolerable , and she must forgive lest she be homeless . For homeless was to be alone indeed , and to be alone was to be lost . She was wakened by the light of dawn rising behind a mountain . Last night she had seen only city streets , but now , getting out of bed and going to the window , she saw the city , a medley of modern buildings and old houses , clustering in a bowl of valleys between mountains . They were not the forested mountains of home . These were great bare spines of rock , purple-shadowed at their base , but on their crests the light was golden . Spectacular beauty , and yet it was up those steep flanks that Chris had struggled as a young soldier , desperate with fatigue and homesickness , and never knowing why he was embattled . Pity trembled in her heart . He had described to her thosep70bitter hours , he had shared with her , she had thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he had not told her of Soonya until the letter came . Her heart hardened again . An hour later she descended a broad stairway and crossed the lobby to the dining room for breakfast . The room was crowded with Americans and a few Korean men in Western dress . She hesitated at the door , searching for a place for herself , and saw only one empty chair , at a table for two , near the window which looked out upon a garden . The man at this table was Korean , a tall man of middle age , his pale handsome face grave . A waiter approached her . " Sorry , " he said . " No place just now . " She nodded toward the empty seat . " May I perhaps sit there ? " The waiter hesitated , then went to the Korean and spoke . The man looked up , surprised , saw her , and rose to his feet . " Please , " he said as she drew near . " Thank you , " she said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat waiting , her head turned away , her gaze fixed upon the garden . It was a rock garden , and between the rocks were expanses of white sand , brushed smooth and then raked in spirals and circles . Small plants bloomed in the hollows of the rocks , and a crooked tree leaned over a pool . And all the time she was conscious of the tall distinguished figure across the table , but she did not speak . Then she heard his voice . His English was excellent.  | " May I introduce myself ? " He took out his wallet , extracted a card and put it on the table before her . She read his name aloud . " Mr. Choe Yu-ren ? " " Businessman , " he said , smiling . " I am in pharmaceutics . My own firm . " She looked up and met his kindly gaze . " Good morning , Mr. Choe . " He bowed . " You are traveling alone , madame ? " " Yes , on personal business . " " Staying some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't misunderstand me ! It is simply that I am anxious to get home , for personal reasons again , and I have no time to sightsee , I am sorry to say . I shall be here only a few days , perhaps . " She was aware of his atmosphere , a pleasant warmth combined with an air of worldly wisdom . He put down his fork  --  a very American breakfast , she thought , ham and eggs , toast and coffee , an empty fruit dish . " Forgive me , " he said . " I am not prying , I hope . It is merely that I spent very happy years in your country as a student  --  Yale , 1935  --  and now I go back each year for business contracts . My firm has connections with leading pharmaceutical companies in your country , and I always enjoy my visits . Your people are extraordinarily hos-pitable . " He hesitated and continued . " Is this your first visit to Korea ? " " Yes , " she said . He hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning . She made no reply . The waiter brought her sliced orange and coffee , boiled egg and toast . When he had gone the man spoke again . " Forgive me if I presume , but it is seldom that I have the chance to return the kindness I have met in your country . If there is anything I can do to help you here , I pray you will accept my help . I wish I could introduce my wife , but , alas , she died last year , and I live here alone in the hotel except on weekends , when I return to my house in the country , where my mother lives . My son is in college at my own alma mater in your country , and I have no other children . " She found herself looking at him , listening to him , thinking that she had never found a more beautiful human being , merely to see . He was tall , and his Western suit of dark gray cloth was of English cut . His hair , turning white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a dark brown . Except for the shape of those eyes , he might have passed for Italian , or perhaps Spanish , but the eyes were Asian . His bearing , his frankness , inspired trust , and upon impulse she opened her handbag and took out the small card upon which Chris had written Soonya 's address . " Can you tell me where this is , please ? " He studied the card and became grave again . " It is a very difficult place to find , quite far from here at the southern edge of the city . How are you going ? By car , of course ? " " I thought of a cab . " " But surely you are not going alone ? " " I do n't know anyone here . "  |p73He  pondered . " Perhaps someone at your American Em-bassy ? " " Oh , no , " she said quickly . " My business is quite private . " He returned the card to her and she replaced it in herbag . He was silent , considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he pushed the dishes aside . " Will you let me go with you ? " he asked abruptly . She was startled . " Oh , I could n't . You are busy . " " I am master of my own time and I have only to make atelephone call to my office . Believe me , I can not allow anAmerican lady to go to that part of our city alone . If youprefer , I will summon my secretary to go with us . Yes , itoccurs to me that you do not know me . " " It 's not that , " she said , and could not go on . " You wish also to remain private ? " he suggested . " In that case I can wait in the taxi while you  --  " She was embarrassed . " It is not my business , actually . It is something that concerns my husband . " " You are married , then . " " Yes , Mrs. Winters  --  Christopher Winters . " " From  --  " " Philadelphia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with characteristic suddenness . " Ah , Philadelphia ! I know that beautiful city . I spent my Christmas holidays there with Dr. Harmsworth and his wife . Do you know him ? " " The great Orientalist ? " " Ah , you do know him ! " " We 've only met. "  | " Then you remember him , for he can not be forgotten once he is seen . I call him my American father . Now he is very old , of course , but I go to see him when I am in your country . He calls me his Korean son . And my own son continues the tradition while he is in college in America , too , and spends his holidays there in that beautiful old house . Alas , the mistress no longer lives . Mrs. Harmsworth died while I was in graduate school . " Suddenly she trusted him and in the decision she felt safe  --  yes , and comforted . She had a friend here . " Please do come with me , " she said quietly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied . She decided during that journey through the streets of Seoul that she would make no explanations . Long ago , as a child , she had learned never to explain , not herself , not her actions . When her mother accused her , scolded her , she replied always by silence . To ask for no explanation , to give none in return , had provided an atmosphere of peace in her youth , her marriage , her home . Now as she rode through crowded streets and parks she said little and Mr. Choe was too courteous , too well bred , to ask questions . Instead he explained the monuments they passed , he expressedthe hope now that she would have time to visit the palaces of the kings now dead , he offered to accompany her to the new museum someday before she returned to her own country . She smiled , she hoped that this would all be possible , she admired in private his handsome profile . She was accustomed to men , for as a scientist she worked among them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more thanp75appearance . He had the polish of old ivory , smooth and opaque , solid yet precious  --  very complex , she decided , and difficult to comprehend . Her impulse had been to trust and was now to doubt . With the patience she had learned from her training in long hours of work in her laboratory , she observed this man . He was masculine and yet there was a feline grace . He was direct and without shyness , and yet she was aware of much unsaid as he talked . She became aware , too , of his skilful questions . " You are an artist , Mrs. Winters ? " " No . Why do you think so ? " " You have an air , a style , detached and yet compre-hending . " " I am a scientist . " He was immensely interested . " A woman and a scientist ? Is this not a contradiction ? " " Not in my country , though not usual , I admit . I am an oceanographer  --  like you , a pharmacologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean expeditions in search of material for medical use ? We Koreans also use sea materials for healing . " " Yes , sometimes I go on expeditions . Not quite as often as I used to do , before my marriage . " " For example , what expedition ? " " Well , the last one was off the coast of Panama . I wanted to collect plankton . " " You were not alone , surely ? " " No , three other scientists were with me . We were studying the ocean itself  --  the bottom , its shapes and contours , the sea water , its chemistry and physics , currents ,  |p76|plant  life , animal life  --  everything possible . Each of us had a responsibility . Mine was  --  is  --  to study that type of life which hovers between plant and animal , and may be either , or both . " " Ah , the bridge creatures ! Yes , they are important  --  but you amaze me ! " She did not answer , for they had stopped at a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke to the cab driver , who nodded . " We have arrived , Mrs. Winters , " Mr. Choe said . " If you will allow me , I will introduce you , and then wait for you outside the house . " Now that the moment of meeting had come , she could not face it alone . " Please come with me . I sha n't be able to understand what is said . I will tell you . I have come to find a child , and his mother . " " In that case , " Mr. Choe said . He descended from the cab and motioned to the driver with his large elegant hand that he was to wait . " Now , Mrs. Winters , " he went on , " allow me to precede you . I will inquire . What is the name , please ? " " Miss  --  Mrs.  --  Kim  --  and the first name is Soonya . " He received this with blank looks , conveying his determination to show neither concern nor curiosity , and knocking on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in a patched black cotton skirt and green bodice pulled the door wide . He spoke , and she nodded . He spoke again , and she shook her head . He turned . " Mrs. Winters , Miss Kim is sleeping . She works at nightp77in a  --  she works at night and wakes late . This is her mother . She invites you to come in . She will rouse her daughter . " She considered and then faced her own reluctance . " Is there also a child here ? " He asked the old woman and she replied . He translated . " There is a child . " " A boy ? " " A boy . " " Is he here now ? " He put the question and the old woman shook her head and burst into loud angry talk . He put up his hand to silence her and translated . " He is not here at this moment . She says the boy is much trouble . He runs away and she does not know where he is until he comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know what to do with him . He is a wild boy , aged eleven . " " I will come in , " she said . " I wish to see the mother and talk with her . I am sorry to have her waked , if she is tired , but I have come a long way , and I want to go home as soon as possible . " " I understand , " he said gravely . They went into a small cramped room , the floor of tamped earth , varnished or polished , she did not know which , but very clean . A low table , a few books , floor cushions , and on one wall a landscape scroll , and there was no other furniture . The old woman patted a cushion . " She invites you to be seated , " Mr. Choe said . They seated themselves and the woman disappeared.  |p78They  waited , Mr. Choe now silent , and she pondered the necessity , or the wisdom , of explaining to him why she was here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago she had never seen this man and might never see him again after today , now that he had served the purpose of bringing her to this house . She looked across at him and smiled , gravely , gratefully . He began an apology . " This house is quite poor . I do n't know what Miss Kim does for a living . Perhaps she is married , in which case I can imagine her husband is perhaps a clerk in a store , or in the post office or something like that . I doubt he is a teacher , unless in an elementary school . She helps in a bar or something like that , perhaps . Most of the bar girls are married and work at night when the husband can be at home . Of course in this case she is caring for her old mother , and perhaps the husband too works at night , since it is difficult to live . " She made no reply to this and indeed could not , for now the inner door opened softly and Soonya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for this woman , though no longer young , was in her full bloom . She wore Korean dress , a long dark skirt and a white bodice crossed at the bosom . Her dark hair was coiled oi the back of her head and her dark eyes , set in the pale cream face and beneath flying dark eyebrows , were tender and questioning . It was so gentle a face , and the whole woman so feminine in grace , small and fine of bone , yet rounded in contours , that try as she would , Laura could not immediatelydislike her . She was prone to first impressions , liking or disliking , and she had consciously decided that shep79would base her decisions upon the emotion of this moment . Nor had she hid from herself her private wish to dislike Soonya . " I will not concern myself with the woman , " she had told Chris . " I owe her nothing . But the boy , because he is yours  --  yes , I want to see that he gets an education . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chris had looked at her blankly . " I suppose it is his country . Strange to think of that ! " Soonya came in , her feet noiseless in small rubber slippers , the toes slightly upturned . She paused in front of Mr. Choe and poured out a stream of talk in a soft high voice , almost a child 's voice . Mr. Choe listened with growingastonishment , his lips pursed . " What is she saying ? " Laura asked at last . " She has seen me before , " Mr. Choe said without explanation . Laura waited , and when he did not speak she put another question . " Ought I to know more ? " " No , " Mr. Choe said firmly . " I remember now who she is . She hesitated , feeling strangely blocked and even ignored . For Mr. Choe motioned to Soonya to be seated and they continued their conversation , he with a question now and again , and she with her urgent , soft , rushing talk . The old woman came in and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stray children gathered , pushing each other this way and that in order to see better what was going on . Mr. Choe looked up , frowned at them and thenp80shouted at them . They ran into the street and then imperceptibly , as talk continued , they crept near again . Laura waited , hours it seemed , but perhaps only half an hour , and Mr. Choe apologized . " Excuse me , please , " he said . " She is in trouble with the landlord . Her son is hard to manage and the landlord wishes her to move away . It seems the boy steals something now and then from the neighbors . Also , she has no husband . She supports herself and the mother and son . " " Where does she work ? " Laura asked . Mr. Choe showed embarrassment . He took out a large silk handkerchief and wiped his handsome brow and then the palms of his hands . " I will explain to you later , " he said . " Meantime she has also told me her greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child  --  he is not a usual boy . He is the son of an American man . Twelve years ago she met this man when he was here after the war . They shared a life together for a year and more . She hoped he would marry her and he promised to return to this country . He went to America when the child was a month old , and from then on she has heard nothing from him . Meantimeshe has had to care for the child alone , although it is not her duty to do so . " She heard this , her heart pounding . She would not betray Chris . Let them think she had come only as a friend , not as a wife . " Certainly it is her duty , " she said firmly . " She is the child 's mother . " Mr. Choe looked at her steadily , his hands outspread on his knees . " Here it is the father who is responsible for thep81child . When there is no father , there is no family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , nor can he hold a job , because the father has not registered his birth . So far as we are concerned , the child has not been born . He has no family , no one stands behind him . Therefore , he does not exist . " She felt a welcome and supporting rush of anger . " That is ridiculous . The child is here . He does exist . " " Not legally , " Mr. Choe said . She could not answer . She was in a strange world , a world she had not imagined , among a people she did not know . She turned to Soonya with a look that was almost pleading . Surely there was at least the bond of womanhood between them ? And Soonya , as though answering the look , rose and searched in a drawer in the low table that stood in the middle of the room . From a silk-wrapped envelope , she drew two photographs which she gave to Mr. Choe , murmuringexplanations in her soft voice . He examined them and handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She did not wish to look at those photographs and would have given half her life to have refused them now , but she took them , nevertheless . Yes , this was Chris , the young Chris with whom she had then already been in love , a wondering , questioning first love , quivering with joy , hidingitself in shyness and waiting . He stood in one photograph , with his arm about Soonya 's shoulder , a very young Soonya , laughing up into his smiling face . And in the second he was holding his son in his arms , his baby son , and Soonya was leaning her head against his shoulder.  |p82I  'll never see him with my son in his arms , she thought , and controlling the strong thrust of pain in her heart she gave the pictures again to Soonya . Now she knew she must communicate with this woman . " Do you still speak English ? " she asked . Soonya shook her head . " Too little I speak now . " Mr. Choe encouraged her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has come to look for you . " Soonya touched her breast with a small delicate hand . " You look for me ? " " Yes , " Laura said . " I have come a long , long way . " She broke off . How was she to continue except by the truth ? She looked from one Asian face to the other . Puzzlement , polite but clear , courteous patience , a veiled curiosity , silent waiting . These were expressed in Asian eyes , in the pose of Asian hands . Soonya felt the teapot , found it hot , and filled the teabowls on the low table . Mr. Choe lifted his bowl and drank in loud sips . Soonya sat on the floor , her hands folded in her lap . Their eyes were upon Laura and they waited . Now she , knowing the moment of revelation had come , opened her handbag and took out a thin leather booklet . She opened it upon the face of Chris , her Chris , the way he was now , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  honest eyes ? Oh , surely honest eyes ! Without a word then , she handed the picture to Soonya . Soonya took it , looked at it , looked at it again with more than interest , and lifted her eyes to Laura 's face . " He it is . " Her voice was a whisper , but Laura heard and nodded . Soonya handed the booklet to Mr. Choe . He took it and examined the face.  | " She says it is her child 's father . " " I know that , " Laura said quietly . She felt faint , the blood pounded through her head , her heart beat at twice its usual speed . Mr. Choe turned to Soonya and asked a question in Korean . " Chris-to-pha Winters-s , " Soonya said , slowly and distinctly . Mr. Choe closed the folder and gave it back to Laura . " Mrs. Winters , " he said , " you are a brave and generous woman . " To her horror , tears rushed to her eyes and rolled down her cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Mr. Choe gave her his silk handkerchief and she took it and wiped the tears away . " I would like to talk with you alone , " she told him . " Let us return to the car . " " Whatever you wish , " he said , and spoke to Soonya . She listened , rose to her feet and then hesitated . Suddenly as though making up her mind not to be afraid , she paused on her way and stopped beside Laura , as though to speak . But she did not speak . Instead , Laura felt upon her cheek the brush of a palm soft as a moth 's wing . He glanced at her as she sat beside him in the car , her gloved hands folded on her brown leather handbag resting on her lap . She had said not a word since they left the small house where Soonya lived , and now , catching his glance , she tried to smile and could not . They were alone , were they not , and still she could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the unfamiliar signs onp84shops , the stark mountains rising beyond the city , all were strange , and the tall man at her side was a stranger . Where could they go so that she might be alone with him ? And would she , after all , confide in him ? She had never been able to speak easily of inward feelings . A silent child , a silent woman , she had often felt herself a silent wife , expressing love through gesture and touch and act rather than through words . But this morning Chris was very far away . Here there was no one  --  no one except this man whom by barest chance she had met only this morning , and now clung to , perhaps merely because he spoke English . " You are weary , " he said . " I think we must have some tea and perhaps a little food . It is past noon . Would you  --  " He paused , lifting his fine eyebrows . " Why not ? You are American , and I have visited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have food and tea ? There we can talk . While my old mother speaks no English , she will be glad to see you . She thanks Americans for their kindness to me when I was young and far from home . And for this kindness now given to my son . " " I 'd be grateful , " she murmured . The car sped through the streets , honking the horn , dividing the people as a prow of a ship divides the waves . Mr. Choe was well known , it seemed , for people spoke his name , and she heard it again and again through the open window . He sat very straight , ignoring them , and not speaking again until they had left the city and a road which ended in a peaceful lane , lined with poplars already in young green leaf . The lane ended at a wide woodenp85gate , painted red and set in a high gray brick wall . The driver shouted and the gate swung open slowly , an old man holding the bar . " Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led Laura into a garden , large and quiet , which was surrounded , so far as she could see , by a vast one-story house , whose curving roof was upheld by huge vermilion pillars . " A peaceful place , " she observed . " Not always , " he replied . " It was occupied by a Japanesegeneral during the many years of Japanese rule . When the Americans came , an American general lived here . It has only been in the last ten years that our propertyhas been restored to us . " A maid was waiting at the entrance to remove their shoes and replace them with cloth slippers . Mr. Choe spoke to her in low tones , she nodded and disappeared , and he led the way into the house itself . " The maid will announce us to my mother , " he said , " and meanwhile we will rest . Do not hurry yourself . Be seated here where you can look into the garden and see the pool . It is the season when life springs again after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The room was large and the furniture was Western , easy chairs and sofas , a grass-green carpet on the floor and curtains of gold satin at the windows . On one side was a shoji wall , but the shoji were closed and what was beyond she could not guess . She sank into one of the chairs , a comfortable resting place cushioned in gold satin . From here she could follow with her eyes a winding path of stepping stones across the lawn and ending in a pool fed byp86a waterfall at its farther end . Beyond it were more curving roofs . Mr. Choe had seated himself and now he opened a black lacquer box with a plum-blossom design in mother-ofpearland offered her a cigarette . When she refused with a slight shake of her head he lit one for himself . A maid brought in tea , pot and bowls , and was followed by a second maid with a tray of cakes and sweetmeats . " Refresh yourself , " Mr. Choe said . " Here you may rest . You are agitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly she felt her tension ease . She put her bowl on the table by her chair , and Mr. Choe filled it with fresh tea . As he did so , they exchanged a look , hers questioning , his encouraging . Thus encouraged she began somewhat abruptly . " Am I wrong in thinking you knew Soonya ? " " Everyone knows her , " he replied . " Try this sweetmeat . It is made by a recipe of my mother 's . We like it very much . " She took a small filled cake from the tray and tasted it . " Delicious , " she said , " but how is it that everyone knows Soonya ? " " She is famous for the house she keeps , " he told her . " She is what you may call a madam , and yet she is not like any other . You saw the modest way in which she lives . I myself had never seen it before . I did not know she lived there . Nor did I know her by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And her professional house , The House of Flowers , is famous for its richness and for its beautiful , well-bred girls . She trains them in allp87the arts . She is herself a singer and dancer , although she no longer practices these arts . She makes but one rule . She will have only Korean clients , and since her prices are high , they are all men of wealth . " She noticed that he did not say " we . " Did this mean that he himself did not frequent The House of Flowers ? Yet he knew Soonya . Ah , what concern was it of hers when she was here only because of Chris ? She began again , plunging into the tangle of feelings and facts . " My husband was here twelve years ago . He met Soonya then , when she was a very young girl . They had a son . All these years he did not tell me . We have been  --  we are  --  happily married . I suppose there was no reason why he should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no secrets from each other . And now the boy has written a letter saying that he has no chance to go to school . I am here to  --  " Mr. Choe leaned forward . " My dear madame , are you telling me that your husband sent you here alone to  --  " " I came of my own free will , " she broke in . " It is a difficult moment for us . It was impossible for him to get away . Besides , the question of what to do about the boy concerns me , too . I do n't want my husband 's son to grow up ignorant , and  --  " She was incurably honest and she went on , though reluctantly . " I suppose I wanted to see for myself , too , how such a thing could have happened . " " What is more natural ? " Mr. Choe said gently . " You love your husband . It is a wound to a woman 's heart in any country when the husband takes another woman . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and saw in his Asian eyes a depth of understanding , a compassion that was too much for her to endure . Her lip trembled and she tried to smile . " We are very happily married , you must know . Even this  --  thisexperienceseems not to have separated us . It sounds impossible , but each of us understands how the other one feels and we  --  each of us tries to  --  to mitigate , or share  --  " " I do understand , " he said gravely . " Yet the self is wounded and it alone can heal itself . So you came here first to see the woman , did you not , and then the boy ? Well , what did you think of the woman ? " She pondered the question . " I scarcely know . Perhaps it 's not thinking so much as feeling . She is soft and gentle . " " She is as hard as iron , " Mr. Choe said . " But she touched my cheek . " " Yes , she is also able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Pity for another woman . She has no illusions about men . You should hear her give a lecture to her girls . " He fell into a fit of silent laughter . " I know her well  --  oh , very well . I am , in fact one of her clients . She is quite famous , you know . She takes revenge on  --  well , let us say life  --  by allowing none but Korean men to enter her House of Flowers . No Western man , especially no Americanman , may enter her door . Let them go to the thirdrateplaces where they belong . ' This is her revenge . Korean men , if they can pay her price , are sure of meeting only girls who do not associate with the lower classes and foreigners . We know her girls are clean and well educated . Above all , we know they are Koreans . "  |p89She  heard this with a tumult of feeling  --  indignation , and wonder  --  mingled with some amusement . Oh , poor Chris ! " Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always ? Oh , no , " Mr. Choe replied . " When I first met her  --  " he paused , coughed slightly . " Please do n't be shy ! " she urged . " We 've passed that , have n't we ? Although we 've known each other such a short while ? " He laughed . " You are very  --  ah  --  understanding . Well , when I first met her she did not have a place of her own . She was singing and dancing and so on , an entertainer primarily , in quite a decent , well-known house . I was attracted by the profound sadness which enveloped her , even when she was singing some foolish gay song or dancing . I invited her to have a drink with me , and we soon fell into talk  --  as you and I have  --  and she told me that she had an old mother and a son to support . Later I heard some of the story of the son , at least that his father was American and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ah  --  the American . She had written but there had been no reply . " He smiled . " I remember being somewhat jealous and because it seemed to me obvious that she would never have a reply , I urged her to set up her own house . As a matter of fact , I lent her the money , which she has returned to me entirely . She is a good businesswoman . " She listened , marveling at the fate which had led her to this man , so strangely related to her and to Chris through Soonya , and before she could consider a question or replyp90to what he had said , the maid appeared at the door with a message . " Ah , " Mr. Choe said . " My mother is ready to receive us . They followed the maid , and were ushered into a centralroom in the house . She knew it was central , for on four sides the shoji had been pushed back to give way to other rooms . There in the middle of a jeweled setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimson velvet and black satin , the low table , the low bookcases of shining black lacquer inlaid with mother-of-pearl , sat a small whitehairedwoman , her face exquisite even in age . In this pale wrinkled face , a cameo , two great black eyes burned as though they were young . Beneath them the mouth was grave . Mr. Choe bowed and spoke to her in Korean . She nodded , still unsmiling , and stared at the visitor . Then in a high , soft voice , scarcely audible , she asked a question . Mr. Choe translated . " My mother wishes to know if you have sons . " " I 'm sorry , no , " she replied . The great eyes staring unblinking upon this news , the soft voice pronounced a few words more . " My mother says that you are pretty , but she does not like the color of your hair and eyes . " Laura laughed . " Neither do I ! I 've always wanted to be dark . But what can I do ? I must accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought a small smile to the ivory face . The lady spoke a few words in a low voice . Mr. Choe laughed in turn , then bowed as his motherp91spoke again and turned to Laura . " We are dismissed , " he said . " My mother is nearly ninety and she is easily impatient . We humor her , and we are very proud of her age . She is the darling of the household . " Laura too bowed , and Mr. Choe , first adjusting a shoji to prevent the breath of wind that was creeping in from the garden , led the way again to the front door , where the car waited . " You are very weary after this long morning , " Mr. Choe said . " Let us return to the hotel and meet again tomorrow ? If I can be of service  --  " She stepped into the car , he took his seat beside her , and in silence they drove the half hour to the city . She was indeed weary , so much had impinged upon mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad of his silence . At the hotel he escorted her to the elevator , bowed formally , his face bland and inscrutable , and she went upstairs to her room . It was as she had left it except that on the table stood a small plum tree in a green pot . It was in full bloom , a shimmer of white in the afternoon sun streaming in from the window . She looked at the card attached . It was from Mr. Choe . Somehow he had found a moment or perhaps he had only spoken to a maid in his house . At any rate , he had found the moment , remembering that she was alone , to send her a plum tree , the symbol of persistent life . Life ? She had had a little too much of it today , she was tired , and she longed for escape . Were she at home , she would have escaped to her laboratory , or even , perhaps , to the cool green depths somewhere in an ocean . As it was , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into deep and instant sleep . It was morning of the next day when she woke . For a moment the rosy light from the window beguiled her into thinking that it was the sunset of the day before . But this light was unmistakably that of dawn . She rose , wondering at the lost and dreamless hours , then realized that she was feeling rested and refreshed and not in the least afraid anymore . She did not even feel haste . Instead she went back to bed for an hour , then bathed and dressed with an astonishing sense of leisure . It was still early , but she walked down the stairs and into the dining room , now empty except for three young men who were probably guests . Obviously it was too early for Mr. Choe , and she found herself rather glad this morning to be without him . She might even take a walk alone , and then come back and write a letter to Chris . After that  --  well , after that she would proceed to do whatever she felt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she finished her breakfast , and afterward she sauntered out to the street instead of returning to her room . People were alreadybusy , clerks walking to offices , women going to market , children to school . The street was a melange of old poverty and new prosperity , if indeed it was prosperity . Opposite the hotel entrance a flower garden marked the division between opposing streets , and she crossed to see what two old men were doing . They were city gardeners , obviously , and obviously , too , in argument over the small plants they were setting out . The younger produced a mapp93to prove his point , for she glanced over his shoulder and saw a colored drawing of squares and stars designed for the flower bed , she supposed . She was mildly amused at this argument that might have happened in any country . Evidentlythe old man was convinced , though against his will , for he grunted , pulled up plants and began anew . And she , about to continue her walk , felt a tug at her jacket from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six ragged urchins , beggar children , who held out filthy small hands for coin . " Never give to beggars , " Chris had warned . " Especially , never to children who beg . Your life will be miserable . " She remembered and was about to escape when she saw a child who stood apart , a tiny girl , bone thin , whose age she could not guess . She paused , not heeding the clamor of the others . Now she put out her right hand and lifted the child 's face and looked down into it . No Asian child , this ! Yet the eyes were Asian in their almond shape , wide , lovely , yes , but not dark , in spite of all . They were hazel , glints of blue through the brown . And the child 's hair was not black . Straight as it was , hanging in tangles , it was a light brown . And the child 's bones , fleshless , were neverthelessof a sturdy structure , without the delicate finials of Asian hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this small , exquisiteface , unwashed and listless in spite of beauty . " Who are you ? " she whispered , though knowing she could not be understood . The other children had ceased their begging . Curious and eager , they pressed about the two , and perceiving thatp94this child had some advantage , the largest of the children , a boy , took the little girl 's hand and forced her to seem to beg . The little girl resisted , nevertheless . She would not beg , and suddenly seeking escape , she burrowed her way among the children and ran down the street before she could be caught . " Oh , I 've lost her , " Laura cried , and pushing the childrenaway , she ran after the little girl , now hidden in the alleyways behind the hotel . Nevertheless , she continued to pursue , and when she turned a corner , she saw the child again , this time in the distance , at a back entrance , she supposed , to the hotel . There the child was waiting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again escape , Laura stood still behind a crooked tree that had forced its way between the hotel and the sidewalk . It was soon obvious that the child was indeed waiting , and suddenlyit could be seen why she waited . For a servingman came out of the hotel with a bucket of refuse which he poured into a wooden box that stood outside the door . The child , seeing him come , had hidden herself behind a wall , but when the man was gone , she stole out from her hiding place , looking left and right and seeing no one , she fell upon the refuse , pushing it about with her little hands , searching and finding bits of food here and there which she thrust into her mouth . What could she do ? Laura asked herself . If she showed herself the child would run away . And even if she caught the child , what could she do to help her ? There must be many such children  --  many , many ! And she was here to find only one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hep95lived . Let her not involve herself with others . She came of prudent Boston stock . Better to take care of one 's own first , and thenAlas , the child had seen her ! Snatching her handfuls she ran , fleet as a sandpiper , down a secret alley and was gone . And Laura , after waiting , could do nothing except return again to the street , but without heart now to continueher walk . Instead she entered the hotel , went to her room and wrote a letter to Chris . It took time , that letter . The sun climbed slowly to the . zenith before she had finished . Yet it was not a long letter , at that . It was only long in time of writing , for how to explain Mr. Choe to Chris , and how to express what she felt about Soonya , a feeling still so vague , the contrast between the soft hand on her cheek and Mr. Choe 's insistingvoice , " She is iron , " and besides , she had not seen the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it expressed compactly even the vagueness of her feelings . " It is too soon , " she wrote , " but I have begun . I have seen Soonya but I have not talked to her . I must find the boy today if I can . It occurs to me that she may not want to give him up . I feel sorry for him living with that old grandmother . Soonya " She crossed the name out . No , she would not tell Chris yet about The House of Flowers . For that matter , she could do no more than mention Mr. Choe . Too much had happened yesterday , and too quickly . Nor did she tell him about the starving child . It was all too difficult . She wrote the three important words , " I love you , " and sealed her letter.  |p96Yes  , now she must return to the house where Soonya lived , she must return alone , and establish her own communication ; perhaps the boy would be there today . She had better go at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be busy at The House of Flowers . The sun was hot by now and she had better wear a hat . And at the moment when she was about to leave she noticed that the plum tree was wilting . She felt of the earth in the pot . It was dry , and putting down her bag she went to the bathroom , filled a glass with water and poured it on the roots . It was not difficult to find Soonya 's house again . She had a good sense of direction  --  it was always she , when Chris was driving , who studied the routes and read the maps . She had been able to direct the cab driver this morning , and in a much shorter time today than it had taken yesterday , or so she thought , she reached the small brick house again . Soonya met her . She had been about to leave on business of her own , but when the cab drew up and Laura emerged , she quietly set down her handbag and umbrella , and putting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one else was there , the old mother not in sight , and no boy about . She felt no ease in being alone with Soonya , and yet was sensible enough to realize that this might be good for them both , an undisturbed hour . But could Soonya speak enough English ? Allowing no Americans in The House of Flowers , she might have had no opportunity to learn more English than she had once had , long ago . And yesterday she had not spoken more than a few words in English , trusting to Mr. Choe as translator . Laura followed Soonyap97to an inner room she had not seen yesterday , Soonya 's bedroom , it seemed , a pleasantly furnished room , strangely American , with pink flowered curtains at the window , an enormous bed curtained with pink silk , and floor cushions covered in the same material . There was one picture on the dressing table , a photograph of Chris , and seeing that young face , a boy 's face , smiling and selfconfident , she fought a sudden impulse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , following her gaze , went to the table and turned the photograph face to the wall . " Long time ago , " she said in English . " Very long time ago . He is not the same man now . He is your husband . I have memory  --  nothing more . " " You have the child , " Laura said . Soonya threw her a quick glance from slanting eyes . " You take him away ? " " No , " Laura said . " Then why you are here ? " Laura shook her head . " I ask myself . But since the boy wrote to his  --  to my husband , it seemed only right that we should know whether it is true that he is in need , growing up without education . " Soonya put up a swift hand . " Not my mistake for this ! He can not go school because he can not be registered . And children are laughing at him there . They call him dirty words . Because his father is American . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I explain such difficulty ? But anyway , he get some education . I have for him sometimes private teacher  --  you call tutor ? " She gazed at Soonya 's softly flushed face . They werep98sitting on the floor cushions , a low table between them . The shoji was open to a rock garden , and upon the branch of a crooked tree a small brown bird sang a sudden triad of notes , piercingly sweet . She turned her head to watch . The song was greater than the minuscule bird body , the throat swelling , the wings fluttering . " And why is his father American ? " she murmured . A long instant passed before Soonya answered . " At first it is true I am not in love with him , " she said at last . " I was very poor . After the war everyone is very poor . My father killed and house gone by bombing . I was only child . Many girls like me . So there is nothing we can do except to sing and dance and live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dance , not man . " " How old were you ? " The lovely eyes widened . " I am having only eighteen years  --  seventeen years by American count . But I am tall as now . Still I am afraid of man , all man . When some man looks at me I look aside . Then one night I see one man come in better than others . " " Better ? " " Yes , so tall , so beautiful , so sad . He is not laughing and yelling loudly like others , just quiet and sad . He is not looking at girls . Then one very noisy boy , hooligan from Texas maybe , and drinking , catch me , pull me away . Then I am crying loudly . Now tall sad man get up , and so quickly he tears me free and leads me to his table . I am already crying very much and he find handkerchiefs and give me . " But this was not what Chris had told her . He had notp99sought her out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or had confused Chris with some other man , before or after . Or was it Soonya who now told the truth ? How corrosive was doubt ! Meanwhile , Soonya was acting the scene , as though remembering , and now she wiped the tears from her eyes , one and the other , with her own handkerchief  --  real tears , as Laura could see . " Such kindness , " Soonya sobbed . " I am not having such kindness usually . So next night he come again . At first he is not there , and I am afraid he is not coming . Then he is coming and I run to meet him at table , feeling him so safely . " She paused , shook her head , and touched her handkerchief to her eyes . Outside the bird sang again , three notes three times , with the same piercing sweetness . " And then ? " " Then we go sometimes to mountain for picnic , and sometimes we dance in evening . And we talk here . I do not know he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fault , always dreaming . I dream he marries me and take me away to America . Ah , America is dream country ! So first kissing , he show me , and afterwards we find small hooch house . When winter is coming with much snow we can not go to mountain and not always at night to dance , if snow is deep and wind too cold . So , it is like this . " " I see , " Laura said . " And did he never say he would marry you ? " " No , never . I have only hope . " " And when you knew you were pregnant ? " Soonya covered her face with her hands . Then she letp100them drop into her lap . They lay there loosely , like lotus flowers , palms up . " I was not wanting baby , I promise . Then he ask me please make baby for him . " " What ! " No , that could not be . Chris would never " But why ? " she demanded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is saying that perhaps he die before he go home again . War is over but not end , he says . He will die in war , and leaving nothing of himself alive . " " And you gave him a child ! " " Because I love him very much . " She gazed deeply into Soonya 's dark eyes and Soonya returned the deep look . " I am thinking , " Soonya said slowly , " I am always thinking he can never leave his child . So he will take me with child to America . I am same as wife if I have child . Then one day  --  a letter comes . " " What letter ? " she asked under her breath . " Your letter , " Soonya said . " I know , because I read . When he is sleeping I read letter , taking from pocket . You are wishing him come home  --  to you . When I read , I know he will go . I put back letter . I say not one word . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But hope is no good . He hears your calling . One day he is gone . Next day his friend is bringing me money and letter from him . In letter , he tells me his home where he is living with father and mother , if I am in trouble . " " It is where we live , " Laura said . " His parents are dead now . Do you have the letter ? "  | " I have , " Soonya said . " I keep it forever . " She opened the door of a small chest that stood in a shallow alcove , and inside that door she pulled out a drawer . Beneath other papers she searched , then turned , bewildered . " It is not here ! Then where is ? I know ! That naughty boy , he take ! Sometimes I read it for him . Always so many questions , this boy . Who is my father , where is my father , why he is not writing , why he is not coming ? ' So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I tell him . " " That is how he knew where to send his own letter . " She saw the whole story now . But what had she written to Chris so that he left these two here behind him ? And had she made it up to him ? No child  --  no child ! She was distracted by Soonya 's sobbing again , a quiet soft sobbing . " Please do n't , " she said . " I ca n't blame you . I do blame him . He should have known , should have taken thought . " Soonya lifted her head with sudden spirit . " No blaming him . It is blame for you . " " I ? But I did n't know . " " Such letter from you , " Soonya said . She did remember the letter . It had been her twentythirdbirthday , a chill November day . She had gone upstairs to her room in her parents ' house in New York to dress for the birthday party her mother had planned for her . Her windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pelting the windowpane and dimming the empty park sent a chill of loneliness through her body . Three years ago to the day Chris and she had walked across that park together , she twenty that day , and they had walkedp102hand in hand for the first time , both shy , both in a tumult of feeling , each reaching somehow for the other . But it had been too soon , she fearful of committing herself before she went back to the university and her dreamed-of career , and Chris saying nothing except to ask her huskily if she would write to him at college . Neither of them thought of Korea . Indeed , neither knew anything about this small , troubled and distant country . She had given her promise , and had not kept it very well . She had written cool , short letters , still shrinkingfrom commitment , for that was the time when she had come deeply under the influence of the famous oceanographer , Don Lawson , and he was persuading her to accompany him and three other scientists on an ocean expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . Young as she was  --  but had she ever been really young ? That was the penalty a woman paid for having what men called " a man 's brain , " although nothing infuriated her more than the idea that brains belonged only to men , as though nature bestowed brains by sex instead of by chance and design of genes . Was it her fault that she , the girl , was the brilliant one in her family ? Yes , she remembered that twenty-third birthday . Sitting at her window with all those somber thoughts , she had been swept by such a rush of longing for Chris , whose last three letters she had not answered because they told her nothing , that she rose and went to her desk and wrote him a hasty letter , impassioned as she had never been before . " Dear , dear Chris , I am twenty-three today , and have you forgotten ? At any rate , there is no letter , though I'vep103waited all day for a word from you  --  even that you might telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me today ? It is raining and cold and the wind is blowing the dead leaves in the park . When are you coming home ? What will you be like , I wonder ? Will you be changed ? Am I changed ? I do n't think so , only older , and more sure of what I want . If I hear from you soon , I wo n't go on the deep-sea exploration I 've been half planning with Don and the others . . . Write me a real letter , Chris ! Or have you decided to reenlist ? In which case I 'll go with Don . " She could almost remember the words . No answer had come and she had let her heart grow still , had gone on the trip with Don , and while he had done his deep-sea diving for algae she had collected her plankton in a net attached to a nylon rope , the rope attached to the stern of the yacht that a millionaire friend of Don 's had lent them . Hour after hour , day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming suit , altogether a scientist , the men thought , and only she knew better . Why did Chris not write ? She telephoned home every third day . " No letter , Mother ? " " None from Korea , dear . " Then when she reached home , Chris was there . He had simply come home . Yes , he said , he had planned to ask for an extended service in Korea , if not a reenlistment , but her letter had brought him home . Now , eleven years later , she understood why the extension instead of reenlistment . The latter could have meant Europe instead of Asia , and it was Asia he wanted , Asia who sat here before her now in the graceful shape of a strange and beautiful woman.  | " For you he leave me , " Soonya said , and sighed . She folded small pleats in the soft silk of her skirt , musing upon what thoughts Laura did not know . The long , straight lashes lay upon cheeks delicately pink , and an old fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , that even Chris might prefer a woman who could and would devote her entire being , body and brain , to him ? They had argued it more than once , she lying in his arms , wholly his , and yet never wholly his , as they both knew . For the hour of love would pass and then and always there would arise in her that cosmic curiosity of the superior brain , the eternal questioner , knowing neither sex nor self , but only the necessity for discovering truth in the universe . She could and did forget him for hours on end . Even for days she could forget him . But Chris could laugh at her . " Remember me , sweetheart ? Your husband ! Give the old ocean a rest , will you ? Let 's fly to the Bahamas ! " Fly they often did , she always with a sense of guilt which she resented , for surely she had the same right to be an individual that he had . He forgot her without compunctionwhen he was in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House someday , as she had every confidencethey would , Chris being what he was , he would be compelled to forget her , and she would understand as she understood now . She did not mind being forgotten  --  no , let her be truthful with herself  --  she was even glad to be forgotten , so that she too could forget and turn to her own work . She was startled out of the deep reverie into which Soonya 's comment had plunged her by a woman 's voicep105from outside the house , a loud , scolding old voice , shoutingKorean words as though she spat them at someone . In reply she heard another voice , a clear young voice , answeringwith laughter . Soonya lifted her head and Laura met her eyes with her own full gaze . " I want to see the boy , " she said . Soonya rose to her feet and moved to the garden entrance , her feet silent beneath her long full skirt . She paused , her hand on the lintel and turned her head to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I send him to you alone . " She walked away then , and Laura saw her flowing rose red skirt moving among the trees and disappearing behind a clump of weeping willows that hung above a small oval pool . How long she waited she did not know . As though I had been waiting all my life , she thought , but perhaps it was only a few minutes . The garden was silent , the bird flown , and she sat , tense and motionless . Would the boy come from the garden or from the shoji closed behind her ? The house was silent , too , as though she alone were there . What if Soonya had betrayed her , had taken the boy away somewhere and left her here to wait and go away at last in despair ? Then she saw him . He came from the side of the house and stood before her , the garden his background . She felt her breath caught in her throat . The boy might have been Chris himself at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . barelegged , wearing blue shorts and a white sports shirt , .  |p106both  ragged , both not too clean . But the dark straight hair was neatly combed and still wet . Chris himself , she thought , except the eyes , the olive skin . Not his mouth , though . This was Soonya 's soft mouth " Good morning , madame , " the boy said . He stood waiting , shy but not ill at ease , wearing a bright , interested look , an excitement , but controlled . A boy too wise for his years ? Scarcely a child , at least ! " Good morning , " she said . " I 'm afraid I do n't know your name . " " My father name  --  Christopher . I am Kim Chris-topher . " " Your English is good , " she said . He came in now and sat down on the cushion where Soonya had sat . A polite boy , she thought , very handsome , but wearing some sort of mask , a protection , perhaps . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " We have your letter , " she went on . " He  --  your  --  your father , would like to have come but just now he is in a political campaign and could not get away . I am here in his stead . " She made up her mind not to treat him as a child , yet she was not sure he understood . If he did not , he concealed ignorance behind courtesy . " My father  --  he is well ? " " Yes , very well . " " You have , new picture ? " " Yes . " She opened her handbag and took out the picture she kept there of Chris , the one she had shown Soonya . Eachp107birthday she renewed it , and since his birthday had been only a month ago , his face , resolute and cheerful , looked out at her exactly as he was . The boy took it eagerly in both hands . " Hair is white ! " he exclaimed . " Only a little at the sides , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , but not quite young . " " He is beautiful , " he murmured , and then lifted his beautiful eyes to question her . " May I keep picture ? " She put down reluctance . " Yes , if you like . Or shall I send you a larger one ? " " This one , please . " He considered the face again . " He not want me ? " She countered . " Do you want to leave your mother ? " He was as clever . " I wish also my father . " " How can we manage that ? " she asked . It startled her somehow that he spoke English so well . " What my father says , I do . I belong father , not mother . " " Yet you are all she has . " " She is woman . She must do he say . If he tell me come , she must also . " " What if he wishes you to stay with her ? " He threw out his hands in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . Supposing he send money for school , still I am nothing . I am not Korean . I am foreign . My father American . Why am I born ? " So might Chris have spoken , young and rebellious , impetuousand heartbroken . She put out her hand andp108touched his arm . " It is only that we do n't know what to do . Tell me  --  you do love your mother ? She is kind to you ? " He drew himself away from the hand resting on his arm . " I love , I hate . " " She is very gentle . Why do you hate her ? " He did not reply . He sat staring into the garden , not moody so much as trying to control himself . What was he suppressing , what angry words and resentful feelings , and against whom ? " Will you tell me what you are thinking ? " she said at last . " No , " he said firmly . He got to his feet abruptly and made a short bob of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to me , please excuse me , madame . " He ran from the room and into the garden so swiftly that it was as though he had never come . She waited for a moment longer and then rose to her feet . The shoji opened at the same instant , as if she had been watched , and the old woman was there . She went out , the old woman following her to the gate , and got into the taxicab she had not dismissed . " Back to the hotel , " she said . The spring day had turned suddenly to summer . When she reached her room she was weary and hot . The air was oppressive , and from her window she saw black thundercloudshanging over the crest of the mountain . She felt far away , infinitely far from Chris , and she went impulsively to the telephone . After half an hour 's effort she reached the overseas operator , but she could get no further.  | " Sorry , " the Korean girl 's voice sang , " we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave up the thought of hearing Chris ' voice , and pondered the possibility of a letter . No , it was too soon to write . She did not know enough yet of the boy to write about him . And what if she never saw him again ? A roar of thunder rumbled over the sky . Sleep , that was her only escape , a hot bath and then sleep . An hour later , washed and cooled , her hair brushed and braided , she lay on her bed asleep , while the storm broke over the city . When she woke it was twilight . Thunder and rain had passed and she felt refreshed and very hungry . She had eaten nothing since morning , she now remembered , and she rose and dressed and went downstairs to the dining room . It was late , the dinner hour was nearly over , but two young men in American uniforms were seated by the window . They looked up as she came in , observed her with interest , as she perceived , and followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table next to theirs . They were finishing their dinner , but they lingered over coffee , discussingher , as she more than suspected . She smiled as one of them caught her glance , and immediately the two of them rose as one and came to her table . " Excuse me , " the younger one said , the red-haired one , " but have n't we met you somewhere ? " She laughed . " I think not , since I came only yesterday . " " Then may we meet you now ? " " Why not ? I 'm Mrs. Chris Winters . " He groaned . " I knew it . We have no luck ! I 'm Jimp110Traynor , and this is Lieutenant Lucius Brown . We 're stationed here , and though we 're not supposed to be in the hotels . . . well , here we are . Why ? Because the beef is good  --  shipped in from Japan . Kobe beef , beer-fed and hand-massaged , so it melts in your mouth . I see you 're eating fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down ? " Lieutenant Brown inquired . He was correct and spare in looks and speech , with the mark of his Boston breeding on him . Jim , in contrast , had clearly grown up on some teeming city street  --  Chicago , perhaps  --  and was immediately and inevitably " Jim " in his leisure moments , without regard to military rank . " Please , " she said . " I was just wondering what I could do with an evening . " They sat down . " Ever been at Walker Hill ? " Jim asked . " I have n't been anywhere , " she said . The two men looked at each other . " Then we 'll take her to Walker Hill , " Jim exclaimed . " Walker Hill , " Brown agreed . An hour later she found herself again seated between two young men , but in what a different scene ! She saw a large room , filled with small tables at which American men sat alone , in two 's or four 's , or with Korean girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes and shouts from the bar . At one end a dancer performed in the scantiest of clothing , a Korean girl , she saw , but imitating with a grotesque grace the antics of a watusi . On the floor American servicemen danced with Korean girls who wore short tight Western dresses , their hair curled and piled on their heads in monstrous exaggeration.  | " Where are we ? " she asked in bewilderment . Jim laughed . " Do n't mind the girls , ma'am . They think they 're being American . They see the old movie magazines and try to look like the Hollywood stars . Try to act like them , too , but  --  " He shook his head . Lieutenant Brown continued for him . " It 's an interestingphenomenon , Mrs. Winters . The girls , who have never seen real American girls , think that all American women are like the movie queens . So they make themselves up as nearly as possible to look like the American stars . Then , reasoning that such stars must behave as they look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a freedom that our girls , even in Hollywood , would never imagine . " " I had a girl yell at me the other day across the street , " Jim began and , catching his friend 's eye , he stopped abruptly . At this moment a girl , exquisite as a madonna , approachedthem and sidled up to Jim . " Me hot body , " she whispered . " Get out , " he muttered between his teeth . Laura laughed aloud . " Really , you are too attractive ! " Her laughter broke their reserve . Here was a woman , a lady , an American to whom they could talk . " Gee , Mrs. Winters , " Jim said , " you 've no idea . If a fellow takes a walk these girls are at him like flies . Why , I 've even had one reach out right on the street and grab my zipper  --  " " Spare us , boy , " the other broke in quickly . " But it 's true , Mrs. Winters . One ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's no temptation to me . I 'm engaged to ap112wonderful girl in Boston , but Jim , here . . . " he grinned . Jim growled . " Cut it out , now . " Lieutenant Brown went on . " Take the young fellows from little towns and farms , though , kids of eighteen , say , to twenty-five or so . They simply give up . It 's not that the girls are so tempting but the fellows are in a rebellious mood anyway and ready for anything . They do n't like it here , they do n't know why they 're here , they 're homesick . Look at that kid . " That kid was a scrawny lad not out of his teens , who shuffled past them , embracing a pretty Korean girl , her body pressed to his , her face in his neck . " That kid , " Lieutenant Brown was saying . " At home no girl would look at him  --  none that he wants , he 's homely  --  as  --  as  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " But he always hankers after the prettiest and most popular girl , the one he ca n't get . Take that little cat that he 's hugging now  --  " Jim interrupted . " She 's told him he 's the handsomest male that ever crossed her path , and he believes it . He 's been wanting some girl to say that to him ever since he was in kindergarten and the little girl next door spat at him . " She listened thoughtfully . " It would n't matter except that perhaps there 'll be a child . " " Plenty of those , " Jim said . " You should see them when you go out in the villages . " The racking music was banging at her ears . A girl was singing a torch song in a kind of English . " Does she know what she 's singing ? " she asked  |p113Jim  shook his head . " Not a word . She 's learned it like a parrot , from some broken-down record she 's picked up . " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinny piano and shuffling feet . Would she or would she not disclose to these two why she was here ? Could they be of help to her ? Yet , how could they be ? Before she could answer her own questions she was startled to see Mr. Choe , tall and elegant , enter the door . He stood there , his eyes searching the crowd until they lit upon her . Then he came to her swiftly , avoiding with grace collisions with dancing couples oblivious to all save their own movements . " Ah , you are here , " he exclaimed when he had reached Laura 's side . " I have been looking for you . " " How did you find me ? " she asked . " At the hotel they knew . " He stood , waiting , and she introduced him perforce to the two Americans . Lieutenant Brown shook hands . Jim nodded . " Will you sit down ? " Laura said . He remained standing . " I have been commanded to give you an invitation and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where ? " " Kim Soonya invites you to see her performance at The House of Flowers . You will be the first American ever to see it . " She rose at once . " You will excuse me , gentlemen ? I have a special reason for accepting this invitation . " " Certainly , " said Lieutenant Brown , and " Sure , " Jim said , as both rose to their feet . She looked back when she reached the door and saw their surprised eyes , still fixed upon her . " I was afraid I could not find you before curfew , " Mr.NIp114Choe said . They were in his comfortable limousine , the chauffeur pressing his way through the crowds . " Happily , at the hotel they could tell me where you were , since they keep knowledge of all foreign guests and where each is at all times . " " Why ? " " These are unsettled days . In case of sudden trouble , such as the unexpected overthrow of government , for example , we must know where each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is for your own protection . " " Arc you expecting an overthrow of government ? " she asked . " We must expect anything , " he replied . " I myself think we are safe for one more year at least . But one never knows what may be boiling beneath our nation 's surface . The times are evil , Mrs. Winters . Our traditional government was a monarchy . This government the Japanese destroyed when they took over our country and compelled our Crown Prince to marry a Japanese princess . For many decades we were subject to cruel military rule by the Japanese . Now , under American advice , we are trying to establish a government we do not understand fully , a democracy which is not native to us . Inevitably there is contention between ambitious men , each with his own followers in the army . Peace is far off . Our young people are rebellious , especially since the trade treaties with Japan . They are tempted by Communist propaganda from the North urging unification of the country at all costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened with attention , understanding fully the portent of his words and yet so concentrated on her own mission that her thoughtsp115could focus only on one small boy who was her husband 's son . " In that case what will happen to children like Kim Christopher ? " Mr. Choe answered without hesitation . " They will be killed . Many have already died . " " What do you mean ? " she demanded . " There was a period in the last decade , Mrs. Winters , when mysteriously many of these children fathered by your men disappeared . " " Disappeared ? " " Yes . They died . In many ways . Also , some of the male children were castrated . Not only here but also in Japan . It is true . This was done . You will blame us very much and we are to blame , but you must remember that we are an ancient people , and very proud . In fact , you have only to see what takes place in your own country when two different races meet by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern profile , handsome and remote as an Asian god , staring into the lighted street . In this moment she made a decision , involuntary with horror . " Then , Mr. Choe , you must help me to get Kim Christopherout of this country . " " It is his only safety , " he replied . The car drew up before a brightly lit gateway , set in a brick wall , decorated with painted flowers . Two girls in Korean dress waited with bouquets in their hands . " Ah , we are expected , " Mr. Choe said . They descended from the car , the girls pressed forward , presenting the bouquets.  | " Welcome , welcome , " they said , one after the other . " Thank you , " she replied , and her arms laden with flowers , she followed them into the courtyard and up marble steps into an entrance hall . The hall led throughout the house , or so it appeared , with shoji opening left and right . At the end of the hall and coming toward her she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bodice of pale gold . Her dark hair was piled on her head instead of hanging in the long thick braid , and as she came near , Laura 's heart chilled . This was surely the most beautiful woman she had ever seen , more beautiful now , she hoped , than when Chris had known her . But the pale fine smooth skin , the classic Asian features , the great dark eyes , these would never change . Meanwhile , Soonya came forward and took away the flowers and gave them to a small dainty girl in a green silk skirt and bodice . " Too many flowers , " she said to Laura . " They choke you . Come , please . " She took Laura 's hand , and holding it delicately , she led the way into a large room . Here men were seated on satin floor cushions , and beside each man was a girl , who served him with food , lit his cigarettes and fanned him from time to time , laughed dutifully at his jokes and endured his caresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cushion of red velvet with a seat back , and here Soonya now invited Laura to sit . It was her own usual seat , it seemed , and when Laura protested , Soonya forced her gently down with her two hands on Laura 's shoulders so that perforce she must obey . Nearby she seated Mr. Choe and a girl came to serve him as the other men were served.  |p117Soonya  , however , all now being in order , did not seat herself . Instead she walked with dignity to a small platform , stepped upon it , and waited . It was not obvious for whom she waited , but whomever it was , she grew impatientand clapped her hands . Immediately a boy walked in from the wings , a Korean boy in the white robes of a man , a wig of straight black hair on his head and a high horsehair hat . He carried a sort of lute such as Laura had never seen before and he seated himself cross-legged on the floor and played upon the strings . After a brief prelude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soprano voice , very pure and clear , and the winding Korean melody gave it full display . Laura listened , enchanted and wistful . How could she compete with this woman ? Why had Chris hidden Soonya in his memory all these years ? If he had nothing to hide would he not surely have told her ? In the midst of these sorrowful questions , she noticed that the boy had lifted his head and was looking at her , his fingers busy with the strings . Then she saw the eyes . They were the eyes of Kim Christopher . She leaned forward to Mr. Choe . " Why have you brought me here ? " " She asked me to do so , " he replied . " And why , and why ? " He waved his hand toward Soonya . " She is singing . Let us listen , " he replied , and she was silenced . " Did you never see this boy before ? " She put the question to Mr. Choe as they drove back to the hotel in his limousine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , before they could meet , she had asked to leave . Mr. Choe had protested . " There is usually a small feast on such evenings . " " I can return quite well alone , " she had replied . " No , no . " He had left then , the girl carrying his topcoat and hat to the car and handing them to him , and he had rewarded her with money , for which she had bowed deeply again and again . " I never saw this boy before , " he now replied . " He my husband 's son . " He turned a startled face . " Not this boy ! He is Korean ! " " She made him look so tonight , for some reason of her own . What is that reason ? " " A devious woman , " he said . " But a beautiful woman is perhaps always devious . " " How will she use this boy ? " she asked . " Who knows ? Perhaps she will make him her business manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was blunt . " Is this place of hers anything more than a brothel ? " He replied somewhat reluctantly . " Perhaps now  --  perhaps one would call it that . You must understand , however , that we older peoples are more worldly wise than you are . Or perhaps it is only that we like an ordered society , and to attain permanent order we have based our laws and customs upon human nature . In your country your laws are corrective , whereas ours seek to follow humannature . For example , we know that men need womenp119as women do not need men . Men are quite simple , in fact . We need women as our wives and the mothers of our children . We also need women as sexual instruments . It is seldom that these two functions can be fulfilled by the same women . We accept this and we allow women to divide themselves . Those who wish to have the stable lives of wife and mother give themselves only in marriage . Those who for various reasons in accordance with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostitution . By the way , our word is not so harsh . We speak of these women as flowers rather than prostitutes . " Her reply to his philosophizing was direct . " A prostitute is a prostitute . " He replied gently . " Does it matter what they are called ? " She caught his sidewise glance . " To us it does . We call a spade a spade . " " Ah , yes , I remember  --  regardless of feelings ! " " The truth can not be hidden . " " No more than the nature of man , " he agreed , " but I think we are more truthful than you are . We accept the prostitute as a part of society . She has her recognized place . At the same time we consider her feelings . We call her a flower . " They fell into silence , but when they had reached the hotel he held her in the lobby , now empty except for the clerk at the desk . " What do you propose to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came here , " she said , " my only intention wasp120to put him in a school and give him an education . . . fit him to earn his living in some honorable way . " " Make a Korean out of him , " he amended . " He is a Korean , is n't he ? He was born here . " " You may call him a Korean but we do not . For us he is the son of his father . He is American . Why does his father not claim him ? Then all problems would be solved . " How could she explain to him ? " You have been in my country . . . " she began . " In your country all nationalities are mixed , " he protested . " There can be no disgrace in being partly Korean . For us it is not the same . We are the oldest people in the world , the most civilized . When your ancestors were living in caves my ancestors were artists and scholars . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been reading . It 's not that . It 's  --  " He waited , tall , dignified , ready to be wounded and she felt pinned against the wall by his piercing steady gaze . She could not evade it . She was compelled to trust him . " My husband is running for the governorship of our state . His opponents would delight in the story of this boy . I simply can not see a fine career hopelessly lost because of a young man 's silly mistake , made in a time when he was lonely and afraid he would never get home again . " " What you are saying is that you do not wish to take this boy home to his father , where he belongs . " " To us it is possible that he belongs here . " " Is he , a human being , to be caught between these possibles and impossibles ? Ah , Mrs. Winters , you had betterface the truth ! "  |p121They  were interrupted by the entrance into the lobby of Lieutenants Brown and Traynor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jim shouted . " Been lookin ' for you everywhere . " " Everywhere , " Lieutenant Brown boomed in his deep bass . " Let me see you to your room , " Mr. Choe said hurriedly . He stepped between her and the Americans , and holding her elbow he led her into the elevator and thence to the door of her room . " Thank you , " she said , with a small smile , feeling torn between irritation and amusement . " Thank you for deliveringme from my own people . " He bowed and waited . She lifted her eyebrows . " I wish to hear the door locked , " he said . " Oh  --  thank you again . And goodnight . " She closed the door and turned the lock . And then , without warning , an awareness of utter isolation fell upon her such as she felt only when , now and again , she was swimming at the bottom of the ocean , alone , surrounded by strange inhuman creatures . In that dim nether world , moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could seize her , which nevertheless she had learned to control . It had been necessary for her to accept the isolationif she were to pursue her way as an oceanographer . She had compromised only to the extent of never going alone to those depths . Now remembering , she recalled a certain afternoon . With her co-worker , John Wilton , by her side , she was swimming at seventy feet below thep122surface of the sea near the isle called Saboga to gather algae . The waving fronds of algae , a miniature forest moving to the rhythm of the surge currents , were a fairylandof trees , delicate as shadows , and yet in which she might easily be attacked by some sea creature , barracuda or shark . Watchful , she had continued her task , which had been to collect the many forms of algae for which they were searching , the healing qualities of which , so near to vegetable , so close to animal , might yet guarantee an eternalsource of antibiotics for the healing of mankind . And then the strange enzymes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexShe had dropped into a chair , musing , and now recalled herself . What was she doing here , involved in a world she did not know and could not understand , alone , without Chris , among strangers who could not help her ? She had no equipment to live in this world , much less to solve a problem which was not hers in the first place , and to which there seemed to be no solution . She struggled with the temptation simply to leave , go home , declare herself vanquished . After all , it was only one of the problems resultingfrom the upheavals of war and the compulsions of alien peoples thrown together by necessity . At this moment , as though she had stretched out her hand for help , the telephone rang . She seized the receiver and heard clipped Korean English . " Mrs. Christopha Wintah , please ? " " Yes ? " " Ovahsheas operatah , please . "  |p123And  then before she could cry out , Chris 's voice cameacross the oceans and out of the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , rising andfalling only slightly upon the waves of atmosphere . " Laura ? " " Oh , Chris , how heavenly to hear you ! I was beginning to feel so sorry for myself . " " When are you coming home ? " " Why , I do n't know . I 've only just got here . I 've found the boy . " " What 's he like ? " " Like you ! " Silence fell . She cried out against it . " Chris ? " " Yes , I 'm here . . . " " I do n't know what to do about him . " " Get him into a school somewhere and come home . I need you . Looks like I 'll get the nomination . " " Oh , that 's good news . " " A long way to go , though . Have you enough money ? " " Yes , plenty . I have n't begun to spend yet . . . I 've seen Soonya , too . " " Does she want money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you are in trouble of any kind , remember to go tothe American Embassy . That 's what they 're there for . " " It 's not trouble I 'm having . . . just that I do n't quiteknow what to do next . " " Come home . "  | " No , now I 'm here , I must do something about the boy . " " Shall I come ? " " No . Whatever needs to be done , I 'll do . " There seemed nothing more to be said , but she clung to the receiver , longing to have him keep on talking . " Chris , you did n't tell me how beautiful it is here . . . but strange . As to the people , I ca n't seem to lay hold of anything I understand . They think so differently from us . " " Get Americans to help you . " " All right , Chris . " His voice suddenly faded . He was speaking but she could not hear . " Chris  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . She could only hang up the receiver and go to bed . In the morning it seemed a dream that she and Chris had actually talked across the oceans . Yet the conversation was clear in her memory . Get Americans , he had said , and with this direction she rose resolutely and set about the day . " Where is the American Embassy ? " she inquired at the desk an hour later . " Across the street , please , madame , " the clerk told her . Across the street she went then and was ushered out of one office and into another , to talk at last with a cool middle-aged woman who spoke with a flat Ohio accent . " Mrs. Winters ? Sit down . How can I help you ? "  |p125She  sat down . " I have come here to find a child  --  a halfAmerican , Miss  --  " " Pitman . Your husband 's child ? " " How did you know ? " " You 're not the first one . Not too many of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for his own child . Not many of them , either . Mostly the children just grow up here . " " Does our government do nothing about them ? " " No , ma'am . We have no policy concerning their care . Our men are now in seven countries in Asia and we  --  " " What is to become of the children ? " " I ca n't tell you . We have no policy  --  " " You said that . " Miss Pitman began sorting papers . " If I can help you  --  " " What is the best thing for me to do ? " " Depends on what you want to do . " " I do n't know what I can do . " " Only one of two things , Mrs. Winters . You can leave him here or take him to the United States . " " What will happen to him if I leave him here ? Put him in a boarding school , of course  --  " " There are no boarding schools here , unless  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then there are no boarding schools here . He does n't qualify as an orphan , of course . " What shall I do , then ? " " Forget him . That 's what most other Americans do . Thousands of these children . "  | " What 's to become of them ? " " Depends on what happens here . If there 's a Communistinvasion  --  might be , if we get so involved in Vietnam that we pull out too many men from here  --  they 'll all be killed anyway , likely , or become Communists , since no one else seems to want them . " She watched Miss Pitman 's spectacled face as she absorbedherself in some task having to do with the papers she was sorting . " Miss Pitman , do n't you care at all ? " " I ca n't afford to . There 's nothing I can do . " " Is there nothing I can do at least about this one boy ? " Miss Pitman looked at her over the spectacles . " If your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an American citizen . " " Just like that ? " " Just like that . " She rose . " Thank you . " " Not at all . " That , then , was all she could do . She could forget him and go home , or she could let Chris declare himself the father and take him home with her . She would go back to the hotel and write Chris a letter , explaining how easy it would be for him merely to tell the truth , and then she could bring the boy to America . And take him home ? Looking so much like Chris ? From the window in the room above hers in the hotel , Mr. Choe had watched her cross the street to the Embassy , had waited and had watched her return again . She mustp127therefore be in her room now . It had been a long time since he had met and talked with an American woman , and vague memories stirred in him . Once when he had been at the University  --  it was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply in love with a girl who now returned to his mind because she looked like this Mrs. Christopher Winters . True , her hair had not been red , nor was she perhaps so beautiful , but at the time he had thought her the most beautiful girl he had ever met . He had written home to his parents asking for permission to arrange a marriage with this American girl . To this they had replied with such agonized pleadings , such threats and tears ostentatiously staining the letter paper , that he had given up the hope , had finished his year and come home to marry the wife they had chosen for him long ago . His Korean wife had borne him an assorted number of daughters , and at last one son . She had married off the daughters in due course , had pampered the son into young adulthoodand then had died , leaving Mr. Choe at his present loose ends . Now alone and ready to be distracted , he found himself torn in two directions , first by the beautiful courtesan , Soonya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roan and he did not contemplate marriage to either of them . It is not necessary to marry a courtesan , although , to be sure , none of his overtures to Soonya had yet gained him more than a smile ; and of course he could not marry an American already married , even if he had been so inclined . Nevertheless he was intensely aware of them both as women , and his imagination was teased by their astounding connection with the same American man , ap128man who must have a peculiar personal power and who now apparently was struggling for political power . He was fascinated also by the contrast between these two women , the one so feminine , so finished a courtesan , and the other one of those slim man-women to be found , he believed , only in America , women who , with burnished hair and glowing eyes and superb figures , have the brains of a man . It was this kind of contrast which he had been trying to describe to Mrs. Winters only the night before . She had listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue the conversation into an area of intimacy after he had escorted her to the door . She had remained unconsciousof his intent , however , and he would have to wait until his spy in the American Embassy could report to him the reason for her visit there . Meanwhile , he decided , he would visit Kim Soonya and if possible see for himself this half-American son of whom she alternately complainedand boasted . An hour later he was seated in Soonya 's private sitting room in The House of Flowers , and at his request she was telling him all about Christopher Winters . She spoke Korean with an elegance which he admired and which he attributed to the fact that she allowed herself association only with yangban Korean men of high quality , like himself . " It is not possible to describe how it happened , " she said . She was seated on a floor cushion and she leaned her elbows on the low table between them . She wore a green skirt and a pale yellow bodice , the sleeves of which , fallingp129away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her hands were exquisite , small and soft , the fingers tapered and the nails like polished mother-of-pearl . " In the first place , I am not , as you know , of the low family of most girls who accept Americans . My parents were educated , my father a teacher , and I was their only child . I have told you of the day our house was bombed and my father killed , and how my mother and I , helpless and frightened , wandered the streets , searching for shelter and food . And you know , too , how the foreign soldiers came into the city like locusts over a field . Not one of us escaped  --  not even my mother . " She hid her eyes with her hand for a moment and then went on . " I can not speak of that . But I saw I had to save my mother . I joined the other girls orphaned by war and made a little money singing and ( lancing . I rented a room where my mother lived while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls and I became often ill , and could not work at all . They were kind and they fed me from their own food . But I could not expect them to care for my mother . One night , dreading it very much , I went into a place where the Americans gathered to dance  --  we were afraid of Americans most of all  --  and I saw a young man sitting alone at a table . He had a beautiful sad face , he was very young , and he was not dancing . I hated their dancing . They did in their dancing , those Americans , what other men do only in bed . I thought if I sat down beside this lonely man , the other men would stay away from me . And my friend Dolly persuaded me also . Thus it began . " " With such beginning , " Mr. Choe said , since she hadp130paused for a long time and it seemed as though she would not go on again , " how did it end in a child ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twisted her hands together in her silken lap . " I was very afraid to let him go , " she confessed . " He did indeed protect me from the others . From those coarse , loud young men , he protected me . They did not approach me when they knew of him , and so at last we came to live together in a small house . He paid the key money to the landlord , one hundred and fifty American dollars , and this money the landlordused for lending , retaining the interest , and giving back again the initial sum to the American when he went home . To maintain us the American bought with his own money goods at the PX  --  you know PX ? " Mr. Choe nodded . " And I sold such goods on the black market and bought our food , and such things as we needed . It is the usual way to live with American men . Also he had some money beside , sent to him in letters from his parents , but he did not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidden to use here because men from the North came as spies into our South and bought this American money to spend in other countries for their own reasons . American money is good anywhere in the world . " " The child is nevertheless not explained , " Mr. Choe observed . Soonya blushed deeply . She was so fair that the slightest blush showed , rose-pink , on her face , and now it was more than that . " I learned to love the American , " she said shyly . " Hep131became necessary to me . I had never loved any man before , but he was kind to me , a good man , and he did not live with other women , only me . I asked him to marry me , and he said perhaps , ' but never did he say he truly would . Then I thought to myself that if I gave him a child , surely he would take the child and me also to his own country . When I told him the child would be born , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that I could not be sure whether I had done well to have a child . When it was born and we saw it was a boy , I still could not be sure . Sometimesthe father was pleased and made happy , sometimes he was sad . Then one day he went away . All this time I had not lived with my own mother and I did not allow her to come to the American . I told him I had no parents . " " Why ? " ? " Because I wanted him to think I depended only on him . I thought he would not leave me alone . You know that he did leave . But I did not tell you he wrote to me from America , one letter . He told me where he lived , and said he missed me so much he might just come back one clay , quite suddenly . I kept it in my room at my mother 's house . " " But he made no promises . " " He never did . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , he never told me . " " You did not ask ? " " I thought he would tell me . Perhaps I was afraid and did n't want to know . " " And you still  --  ah  --  love him ? "  | " No , " she said . " Long ago I ceased to love him . " " And so ? " " He must pay well for the child , " she said . Outside the shoji , hidden behind a gardenia bush , Kim Christopher listened . He had never heard the story of how he was born , and had only recently found out his father 's name . Before that he had known only that his father was an American and this made him a stranger , one of the new people here in Korea . " These new people , what shall we do with them ? " It was what people said on the streets and in the shops . Sometimes the talk went further , sometimes it became dangerous and frightened him . A proud old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd , " They must be thrown into the sea if there is no other way of ridding ourselves of these new people ! " And he could not go to school , and anyway , the Korean schoolchildren laughed at him and pointed their fingers at him . " Your mother is a whore because your father is American , " they shouted . " Only whores sleep with Americans , " they shouted , and they called him " Round Eyes " or " Big Nose , " though his eyes were not round nor his nose big . From the very first moment of his memory he knew that he had no place in this country , though he had a grandmother who was kind to him one day and cruel the next , and a mother whom he loved because she was beautiful but hated because she lived her life apart from them . It was only yesterday that he had for the first time been inside this other house of hers , filled with beautiful girls . She had brought him here , she had seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him that from now on he would help her in The House of Flowers . He should learn the business , she said , but what did she mean by that ? That was what he had not yet discovered . He liked to sing and he liked to play the lute . He had learned these by himself , out of love for her , because she could sing so sweetly . He earned a little money sometimes by sweeping the streets in front of outdoor shops and he had bought the lute , a cheap one and not very good but it was a lute . And he had been proud last night when she told him to sing for the guests . There had been many men last night after the entertainmentwas over who had come to see the girls and gone with them into small rooms and shut the doors . But no man went into his mother 's room . He did not sleep there , either . He slept in the gateman 's room , an old man who snored all night . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see his mother and he had hidden himself in the garden just to listen and to watch . Now Mr. Choe was going away , and he waited as still as a rabbit until he was gone . When his mother was alone , an old woman came to offer her tea and his mother shouted in a voice he had never heard before . " Get gone . Leave me alone ! " Now the old woman too was gone and he heard sobbing . Ile peered out of the gardenia bush and saw his mother sitting there alone on the floor cushion . She had folded her arms on the low table and had laid her head down , and she was sobbing softly to herself . Hesitantly , he moved toward her . " Now I know , " he said , in Korean.  |p134Soonya  lifted her head , " Know what ? " " Who I am , " he said . " You are my son , " she said . " Have you not always known that ? " " I know my American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does it matter what his name is , since he does not recognize you ? He has never sent money for you , he has never asked whether you live . " He glanced at her from under his lashes . Did she know or did she not know about the letter ? " I know where he lives in America , " he said . She suddenly screamed at him . " And you wrote him a letter ! You searched in my private desk and stole his letter to me and wrote to him against me ! " " I did not  --  I did not write against you ! " He was stammering as he always did when she frightenedhim . He was frightened now , and seeing the fear in his eyes she flew at him and slapped him on both cheeks , this side and that , this side and that . He cowered down to the floor . He was not afraid of her , he always told himself when he was not with her ; and why should he be afraid of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was simply that if she , his mother , did not love him , then who could love him ? He was utterly alone in a land strange because he was a stranger . Crouched on the floor , his arms over his head to shield himself , he felt her foot kick his buttocks . " Get out of my sight , " she said . " After all I have done for you , you hate me ! " He got up , sobbing . " I do n't hate you . " " You do , " she insisted . " You love your father who has never cared whether you live or die . "  |p135They  faced each other and suddenly he felt the strength of a new anger fiery in his veins . " Must I grow up a nobody ? What shall I do with myself when I am a man ? Am I to be a ragpicker ? A beggar ? " " You will help me in this house , " she told him . " You will do whatever I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she shouted . " Yes , a servant , if that is all you are fit to be ! " They stood staring at each other , and suddenly he realizedas never before that he was her son , too . The face before him was like his face . He saw the resemblance , though dreaming so long of his American father he had imagined himself American . " What do you want me to be ? " he demanded . Anger faded . She sighed and sank down on the floor cushion again . " You can go into business with me . You have a fine voice and you play the lute well enough . " " Girl business , " he muttered . " Only beginning thus , " she said . Who could have imaginedthat this same voice had screamed at him a few minutes ago ? " You can learn how to keep accounts and at least manage the business . When I retire it will be yours . " Ile considered . He was no child , he had never been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose fathers had been like his , hung about the American camps and offered their sisters to the men for a commission . One such boy was his best friend , if he could be said to have a ' 1 friend . Only yesterday , when they had been playing jackstonesoutside the gate of the barricade surrounding the camp , the game was stopped because a trio of youngp136American men came out and the boy had leaped to his feet to shout at them . " Hi , hi , wanta girl ? Nice girl , sexy , sexy . " The men had shoved him out of the way and they had resumed their game . But sometimes the young Americans stopped . Sometimes , even , they seemed to stop just to make friends with the boys . One he well remembered had offered him money to get him into The House of Flowers . But Kim Christopher had never been there himself and was much too afraid of his mother to try . So he had refused . " What are you thinking ? " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering he slouched away . She shouted after him in renewed anger . " Come back . . . answer me ! I 'll beat you ! " He did not obey . Suddenly he was not afraid of her . Suddenly he knew he would never be afraid of her again . He knew now what she wanted him to be  --  a boy to serve her , a man to sell women knock at the door , a tentative , hesitating knock . She opened her eyes and did not rise . She was very weary , a fatigue that had nothing to do with her body except that the weariness of her spirit , pervading , made her listless . The knock came again , this time more clearly . She rose and put on her dressing gown . There stood the boy . Had she guessed a hundred times she could not have imagined it would be he . He stood mutely looking at her , this morning in hisp137usual shirt and shorts , bare-legged , his feet in straw sandals . " Come in , Kim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He came in and stood looking about him . " Please sit down , " she said . She sat down in one chair and he took the other . The light from the window fell on his face and on his cheeks she saw the slightly red lines of a blow . " What is the matter with your face ? " she asked . " My mother  --  " He lifted his right hand and imitated the blow . " Oh , no , " she breathed . She rose from her seat impulsivelyand went to him , and putting out her hand she smoothed his cheek . The skin was fine and soft . That was the Korean side of him , she thought . " Why was she angry ? " He was not sure how far his English would go . He made an effort now . " My mother  --  she  --  she  --  talk I stay by her . " " You mean in The House of Flowers ? " He nodded . " Work . " " Do you want to work there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , striving to divine his thoughts . " You love your mother ? " Obviously he understood more than he could speak . " Sometimes , " he said . " Sometimes , " she repeated . " Is she kind to you ? " I Ie hesitated . " No school . "  | " Your grandmother . Is she kind ? " He leaped to his feet and imitated beating . " She do so on me . " He sat down again and folded his hands on his young bony knees . He stared at the floor , his face impassive , the long straight black lashes lying on his cheeks . How like he was to Chris and how unlike ! What was to become of him ? " Suppose I send you to school here , Kim Christopher , " she said . He shook his head in his decisive fashion . " No ? " He lifted the long lashes . " America , " he said simply . She sighed , pondering the puzzle of this child born too soon for the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know , " she said . " I know , I know . " She got up restlessly , and going to the window she stood gazing out over the alien city . Yes , but it was not a matter to be settled by one child . There was Chris to be thought of , not to mention herself . Well , she could put herself aside , for in her detached life as a scientist people were beyond the horizon , and in her other life , her life with Chris , what people thought meant nothing . But Chris , whose life and career depended upon the whims , the prejudices , the narrow likes and dislikes of a constituency . . . what would they say if she brought home a lad who looked enough like Chris to start gossip flaming across a state  --  nay , a nation ! Such flames could destroy him and make ashes of his life . Ah , it was only the child who was wholly innocent.  | ' 1 , She turned impulsively and went to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those sorry clothes he wore ! She must take him now and get him some decent things to wear . Then she 'd take him to lunch downstairs and give him a full meal . He was bone thin , his ribs defined in ridges under his skin , that wonderful skin , smooth and cream-pale  --  Asia 's gift . " Kim Christopher , we 'll buy you some new clothes . Show me a shop . " She fingered his shirt , shaking her head , conveying disapproval . " Ah , " he exclaimed , enlightened , and seizing her hand , he led her downstairs and then pointed up the street . " Clothes ? " she inquired . " Yes , yes , " he said eagerly and within the hour he was outfitted , three changes of everything and a crimson jersey for cool days . " Put these on , " she said , and when he had done so , she took the garments he had been wearing between thumb and finger and threw them to one side . " No more those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was shocked , she could see , but she was adamant , and led him away in triumph , proud of his looks . If Chris could see him now ! She checked herself . She must not be carried away by her own enthusiasm . True , he was beautiful . But that was to be expected , was n't it , with Chris for his father  --  and yes , let her be generous , with Soonya for his mother . Yet surely there was a special alchemy here , for the had not seen Korean children as beautiful as this one , nor indeed the children in her own city , with whom shep140had grown out of childhood . It was not merely a matter of feature and coloring . There was an added grace , a combinationperhaps of grace with strength . Kim Christopher was more graceful than the American child , and stronger than the Korean . She thought of her sea plants , those bridging creatures , the delicacy of the waving fronds of seaweed somehow verging into the strong life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was waitingbefore her in quiet patience , standing for her judgment . " Good , " she said . " Now you look handsome . " " American ? " he inquired hopefully . " Yes , " she said , in truth and untruth . Very American here in Korea , but when she got him home  --  if she took him home  --  she knew he would look Asian . Where , where was his country ? " Let us go back to the hotel and have luncheon , " she said . She saw the instant she entered the dining room that Mr. Choe was there at his usual table by the window . She smiled and waved her hand , and then chose another table , where she could be alone with Kim Christopher . Seating herself and him , she enjoyed the frankly interested looks that Mr. Choe directed toward them . Nor was he the only one . Tourists , American and European , glanced at them , and she could almost hear their conversation , framed in question and conjecture . She even had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite her at the small table ; but he was unconscious of the looks andp141glances , being earnestly intent upon watching her while she used knife and fork . The table napkin confused him until he saw her unfold her own and use it on her lips . Indeed , he copied each movement she made , so resolute upon achieving correctness that she was touched . When Mr. Choe had finished his own meal he could not contain his curiosity further , and he made occasion to pass by their table . There he paused . " How are you today , madame ? " he asked in his courteousfashion . " Very well , thank you , " she said . " I have been on a shopping expedition with Christopher . " It was the first time she had used the boy 's name without the Kim surname , and she was surprised that she had done so . A veil came over Mr. Choe 's keen eyes . " Ah , yes  --  so , " he said . " He looks very nice , almost like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to America ? " She smiled at Christopher . " Am I ? " " Please , " he said under his breath . " His mother must give her consent , must she not ? " Mr. Choe inquired . " I hope she will , " she said , and was further surprised at herself . She did not think she had made any decision , but something in Mr. Choe 's voice and looks compelled her so to speak . " Ah , let us hope , " Mr. Choe said gently , and went away . The quiet certainty of his manner disturbed her , andconfirmed her . When the meal was over , when Christopherhad eaten a massive dish of ice cream to top off thep142preliminary courses , she found it difficult to let him go . Yet , what would she do with him here ? Too much remainedto be decided and then to be done . " Come back tomorrow , Christopher , " she told him in the lobby . She gave him the box of new clothes and lingered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , madame , " he said . She was about to say , do n't call me madame , but what then should he call her ? Mrs. Winters was too cold , Laura too intimate . He had his own mother , and it would only confuse him if she were to use that name . Better to leave it as it was , she thought . It would depend eventually on what was decided . " Goodbye , " she said , and refrained from the impulse to kiss his cheek . When she returned to her room she found a long letter from Chris , the first she had received . She had been in Seoul only a few days and yet it seemed weeks , and she seized the letter , sank into a chair and forgot all else . He began : " Dear and Only Love : Your all too short letter  --  " Yes , darling , but I had n't anything to say yet , she murmuredunder her breath. "  --  simply made me frantic . I would have skipped everything and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a new problem for you . By now you 've seen the boy . " Oh , I wish you 'd seen him , she thought . It would makep143the decision so much easier . Or would it ? Perhaps it would be only more difficult if Chris saw him . " I do hope that the woman is n't giving you trouble . " These few lines sufficed him for the problems she was facing alone . From them he plunged into an enthusiastic account of the campaign . She could see him rushing from one appointment to another , speaking on television  --  he was extravagantly photogenic . Her eyes hastened over the pages . Letters were pouring in by the thousands . He had tough opposition from the old guard , nevertheless . They had private detectives searching his records , examining his every act from the time he was a boy . Filthy business , but it was a cutthroat struggle . His youth helped . " And your extraordinary beauty , my darling , " she whispered . " Henry Allen has been a rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position not only in the state but nationwide . Just to have his name on my masthead means everything . Of course I feel responsible about measuring up to his expectations . I must conduct an absolutely clean campaign . But that I would do anyway . I 'd hate myself other-wise . " Of course , she thought proudly . She kissed the letter , folded it and tucked it into her bosom . Then she gave herself up to the luxury of thinking about him . She leaned back and closed her eyes and thought of him . In an age when love was minimized and mundane sex exalted , how had she been so fortunate as to find a man who understood love ? And who can and does love a woman like me , she thought , and who wants me to be what I am and not justp144an appendage to him , any more than he could be just an appendage to me ? So rare a happiness must not be spoiled by a boy born on the other side of the world , a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lovable , lovely child , but he must not be allowed to ruin a splendid life , one that would be useful to thousands , millions of people , millions , that is , if Chris were not stopped in his career by a few enemies who were selfish entirely for their own ends and cared nothing for the morality they professed . She thought of Henry Allen with sudden dismay . Should Chris tell him , or should he not ? And if not , was that entirely honorable ? Oh , the frightening demands of honor ! " Darling , " she wrote in her large clear handwriting . " Do you think you should tell Henry Allen about Christopher ? It is so trying , is n't it , not to be just ordinary citizens , the boy our private concern , and we not having to care what people think . For of course there are thousands of children born as he has been born , and we could simply bring him home and say we 'd adopted a Korean war orphan and let people think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now , with all your brilliant future before you , one does n't know what to do . And I can not allow you to give up the future , I simply can not , because of a mistake  --  " she crossed out mistake thoroughly so that he could not see that she had written it , and substituted an experience and hastened on . " It is difficult to wish he had n't been born , for he is a beautiful boy , so like you , alas , and yet not  --  just himself , I suppose . I can not make out what he thinks of his mother except he wants very much to come to you . Today I bought him new clothes  --  "  |p145She  had finished the letter before she realized she had written so much about Kim Christopher , five closely covered pages . She had not thought she knew so much about him . She sealed the letter and sent it airmail and then fell into a fit of such deep longing for Chris that she flung herself on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weep but for home and the life she knew and loved . She saw their house , set in the quiet street just off the Square , the spacious house , faced with white marble , and inside the cool marble foyer and the marble stairs winding their way from floor to floor . Long ago a man who was an ancestor of the family of Winters had fallen in love with a lady of France , but she had refused to leave her chateau until he promised her that he would change the very heart of his American house and give it a French heart , like that of her chateau . At immense cost , the size of which increasedwith each generation in the telling , he had torn out the inside of his house and built it anew exactly like the house in France . . . I am homesick for the house , Laura thought , and for the tree-lined street  --  yes , even for the neighbors to whom she paid scant heed when she was there , for she was not a neighborly person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her work , and at night she and Chris liked best to be alone , or at least to have guests of their own choosing . Now , thousands of miles away , in a strange hotel in an Asian city , the house seemed a dream , except that Chris was there and she must hasten home to him again . In a few hours she could be there . He had insisted that she must keep a return ticket always with her , in her handbag , with her passport and her traveler 's checks.  | " One never knows , " he had declared . " Do n't forget that Seoul is only ninety miles or so from the borders of the enemy . You must be ready to leave at an instant 's notice . " She was tempted by this very instant . Yes , she could simply walk downstairs , take a taxi , go to the airfield and leave by the first jet . She imagined herself doing exactly that and at the same time knew it could not be . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she must simply think what to do next . And as though in answer to her question the telephone rang . " Yes ? " she said , receiver in hand . " Mrs. Winters ? " It was the resonant voice of Lieutenant Brown . " We wondered , Jim and I , if you 'd like to take a drive and end up at Walker Hill , maybe for dinner and a couple of dances . " " I 'd enjoy that , " she said in desperation . " Good , " the voice rejoined . " We 'll meet you in half an hour in the lobby . " " Good , " she agreed . The two men were spruce in their freshly pressed uniforms , two such very different men . " Did you know each other before you came here ? " she asked irrelevantly , as Jim headed for the country . " No , we met when Jim saved my life , " Lieutenant Brown said gravely . " A mob of students was rampaging through the streets one night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must say we were forcing down their throats , and I was the only American in sight , headingback to the base . At that moment Jim happened to stepp147out of the base . He rushed into the mob and dragged me safely back through the gate . But I was beaten up . " " I 'm ignorant , " she said . " Why do they not want the treaty ? " " Well , it 's natural , " he replied . " Japan ruled them pretty roughly for more than half a century . They 'd been a free people up to that time and they are proud , as you can see . The Japanese are fairly thorough themselves , whatever they do . They tried to destroy the Korean culture , made Japanese the language for schools , and so forth . The people here do n't trust them  --  never will , maybe . They think the Japanese will get economic control again and move into total rule . Perhaps they 're right . At any rate  --  " She broke in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , they 'll have a rough time , " Lieutenant Brown said . " Rough ! " Jim snorted . " Do n't forget a lot of them have already been killed . " " Oh , no ! " she cried . " Sure , " he said . " Why do n't you see any teenage halfbreedsaround ? Precious few of them ! They were got rid of in the fifties , that 's why . Lots of ' em , anyway . And some were castrated . " " Shut up , Jim . " " Sure they were . I know a fellow who was aide to the General who saw the kids with their little parts all  --  " " I said shut up ! " Lieutenant Brown shouted . Jim maneuvered the car out of a rut and was silent.  |p148They  were all silent for a space , considering , against this superb landscape in the sunset quiet , the terrible fate of the children of war . Already the shadows lay in the valley as the sun tipped the crest of a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here and there a poplar tree , golden with autumn , stood like a flaming torch against the darkness of rock and cliff . Villages clusteredbetween the fields and now and again she saw the tall white-robed figure of a man , wearing a high hat of black horsehair tied under the chin , who was passing with dignityfrom one village to another , or a woman in a flowing skirt and tight bodice carrying a load on her head , her queenly figure upright under her burden . Kim Christopher ! She should be grateful , perhaps , to Soonya for keeping him alive  --  or not grateful , perhaps ! Out of such thoughts she spoke , her voice low . " I shall never understand how our men can  --  can consort with these women and let children be born  --  " Jim interrupted sharply , eyes fixed on the road ahead . " I have a girl , Mrs. Winters . She 's a decent kid . Sticks to one guy  --  me . But I 've told her , Boy , the day you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid , that day I leave . ' So she knows better . She knows I 'm good to her so long as she does what I say . " " And has abortions , " Lieutenant Brown said grimly . " That 's her lookout , " Jim retorted . " Some of them have eight or nine abortions a year . " " Not my business , " Jim said . Three ragged children ran into the road ahead of them so suddenly that Jim swerved the car aside and all butp149struck a small wayside shrine . The children were screaming at them and begging , their small filthy hands outstretched . " Speaking of kids , " Jim muttered , searching his pockets . " They 're all half-breeds , " Lieutenant Brown said , peering at them . " Villages are full of them , " Jim said . " Here you are , kids . " He tossed coins into the dust and the children fell upon them in search , scrabbling in the brown dust and pushing each other like dogs about a bone . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One small boy had red hair and freckles , and the girl had the face of an angel , set in a frame of dusty brown hair . She was shouting at the boys and beating them with her clenched fists . " Let 's go , " Laura said . " I 've seen enough . " They had finished their dinner and were lingering over coffee , she loath to return to the hotel room , reluctant to be alone , uncertain what to do next . The big room at Walker Hill was crowded with American men in uniform and Korean girls in Western dress . She had refused to dance , feeling disinclined to join the swaying , clutching crowd , and Jim had whirled off with one of the hostesses , a slim thin girl , taller than he . " Be careful , " his friend had told him . " She looks tubercular . " " She 's okay , " Jim had said curtly.  | " Half of them have T.B . " But Jim was already swallowedup among the dancers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " They ca n't , " he told her . " They have to keep working . Half of the children have it  --  at least half . " " Not that many , I hope ! " " Why not ? Who cares about any of them ? " Under his dry bitterness she began to guess there was a kind man , rigid by upbringing , but rigid first of all with himself . " I think you care about them , " she said softly . " I do n't let myself . " At this moment the announcer came on the platform at the end of the room . The music stopped and the dancers paused . He smiled brightly and lifted his voice . " We have tonight very nice treat . Belly dancer from San Francisco is here . She is very famous in America . Please watch closely her cleverness . When she is finishing , we have more treat . Miss Kim Soonya will sing by special request . " Laura started . " Did you know she was coming ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " She does sing here sometimes , but very seldom . The last time was when we had a visit from VIPs . She 's hard to get , at least that 's what they say . It 's considered a sort of honor  --  strictly on her level , that is , to get her to sing anywhere but her own place . " " Her level is not high ? " " Curiously , her personal level is high . That is , everyone knows she ca n't be had by a man . "  | " Not even a Korean ? " " No . " The belly dancer appeared , a painted blonde of striking proportions . She wore tokens of costume , a bikini strap about her loins , a gold tassel on each breast . The dancing stopped altogether , men sank into chairs and girls leaned to watch . The music blared into rhythm and the girl began her dance , an extraordinary series of muscular movements , while her body remained stationary . Her skeleton was the fixed framework upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirled and stiffened . Belly and breasts were independent , the belly moving like a coiled serpent and breasts , each independent of the other , swirlingmadly under the flying tassels . Laura , watching this physical medley , found herself convulsed with secret laughter , for above this body dance , the girl 's face was a painted mask so totally without expression that it was impossible to believe it knew what went on beneath it . The blue eyes gazed unseeing upon the surrounding scene ; the mouth , a vivid peony of red paint , was unchanging . Laura looked about the room . The Americans were all laughing , but every Asian face was grave as Asian eyes were fixed somberly upon this spectacle from the West . She was aware of a creeping sense of embarrassment , mounting indeed to shame . Who was this girl ? From what parentage had she sprung , and why had she not stayed in her gay native habitat , instead of wandering to these dignifiedand ancient shores ? The dance finished , the Americanmen burst into loud applause in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left the stage . The announcer came forward once more . " Ladies and gentlemen , Miss Kim Soonya ! " Silence fell , and in the midst of the silence Soonya entered . She wore Korean dress , as she always did , her billowing skirt of rose brocade , her bodice silver . Her long black hair was braided down her back , and upon her feet she wore silver slippers , the toes upturned in some fashion reminiscent of her early ancestors who had come from Central Asia . Her hands were clasped loosely in front of her as she stood , motionless , and waiting for music . It came from the small dance band , in muted chords of stringed instruments caught together by the beat of a deep-toned drum softly struck . She lifted her head after a long instant and began singing . The song she sang was not Korean . It was Tchaikovsky 's " None But the Lonely Heart . " There was no raucous laughter now , no staring Asian eyes . This music was universal , understood by East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and fell , melted to a whisper and lifted to a cry . When she finished there was a moment , a spellbound moment , and then a roar of applause . She bowed and left the platform , moving so smoothly that she seemed to glide rather than walk . The applause held , but she did not return . Instead the announcer came forward . " Miss Kim Soonya thanks the audience , but she begs to be excused . She never gives encore . " Laura had listened at first with surprise , then with admiration , and finally with profound puzzlement . Why had Soonya chosen this song ? And how had she learned it ?  |p153Was  it meant as communication ? Then communication with whom but herself ? And yet how could Soonya know that she was in the audience tonight ? There were too many questions to be answered , and above all was the question , what manner of woman was this Soonya ? She rose impulsively from her chair . " Excuse me , " she said to the two men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall and made her way behind the stage curtain . There in a small room she found Soonya sitting before a mirror , but she was not looking into the mirror . She had laid her head on her folded arms and was weeping in deep , half-suppressed sobs . Laura paused at the door , then went in swiftly and put her hand on Soonya 's arm . " Soonya , " she said . " It is I. " Soonya lifted her head and drew back with such suddennessthat Laura was startled . " Why you come here ? " Soonya demanded . The tears were wet on her cheeks and hung on her long eyelashes . " You sang  --  you sang so beautifully , but  --  " Laura stammered . " That song  --  why did you  --  who taught it to you ? " " Why you care ? " Soonya 's voice was sullen . " I do n't know , but I do , somehow . " She was stammering , speaking her thoughts to Soonya before she knew what they were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understandeach other , you and I. I do n't want to hurt you . I hope you do n't want to hurt me . Perhaps together we could decide about the boy . I have n't been thinking aboutp154you , I 'm afraid , only about myself  --  and my  --  and the boy 's father . " Soonya was wiping her eyes now with a delicate froth of silk which she drew from the bosom of her bodice . She rose and closed the door . Then she motioned Laura to a chair and sat down , her back now to the mirror . Biting her lip , she began to talk . " I not brave woman . I make talk like brave . I love your  --  I love very much . So I learn that song for myself . It is saying what I think , what I feel . I dream too much . I dream some day he is coming back to me . I can not love other man . " " You are trying to tell me that you want to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , I am not telling so . He is like father . I know now he not love me , never . " The beautiful lips were quivering and she bit them cruelly . " Please , " Laura said . " what is it you want ? I will try to get it for you if I can . " Tears were flowing again but Soonya wiped them away resolutely with the silk handkerchief . " I want only money now , " she said at last . " I want money for myself . " " Money , " Laura echoed . Soonya lifted her great eyes to Laura 's face . " I want live alone in some house , " she said . " No more House of Flowers . No more girl . No more anything . Only me , alone in house . My old servants caring for me  --  everything . If he not want me , then give me house alone for me . " " And Kim Christopher ? "  | " If no money , I keep him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said simply . " If money , you take him . " " I will take him , " Laura said , with instant decision . She hesitated , about to leave , anxious to leave , and yet yearning in some strange fashion over the lonely beautiful woman . In another land , in other times , they might have been friends . What divided them was not race or language , but love , love of the same man and war instead of peace . She put her hand on Soonya 's shoulder . " I am sorry  --  sorry , " she murmured . But Soonya moved away . " You are lucky one , " she said indifferently . " I am unlucky one . " And then as though she had not wept , or had not sent away her child , she leaned toward the mirror , and with a lipstick from an American PX but bought on the black market , she carefully corrected the outline of her lovely lips . This , then , was what Laura had to convey somehow to Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be taken to America . " One step at a time , darling , " she wrote that night in her hotel room . " I do n't see the future clear  --  oh , not at all ! The problem remains , what to do ? But I must bring him home . The process is simple . You must send me an affidavit of paternity . I think the people at the Embassy will be kind  --  anyway , helpful . Declare that Kim Christopheris your son by Soonya and that I am your wife , and that you wish me to bring him back with me . I will manage the rest . If you have this document sent to me thep156day you get this letter , within a week I should be home . Meet me in San Francisco . Of course we 'll have to pay Soonya . " She described the scene she had had with Soonya . How much money ? He would know . But it would be made plain that there could be no persistent demands . Five thousand dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , lent out at interest . Or ten thousand if they must . No , it was not buying the boy . It was replacing him with the money he might have earned had he stayed with Soonya . " Soonya wants money , " she wrote , " but for a real reason . She wants to rid herself of the life she 's been living . She wants to live alone . She makes me feel guilty because I am your wife , in a position she would so much wish to have for herself . I believe she loves you . " Here she paused and after an instant she inked out the last words . No , she would never understand exactly what had happened and it was wiser not to remind Chris , even now . In The House of Flowers , Soonya was talking to Mr. Choe . " You can see that I can not go on forever like this , " she was saying . She waved a delicate hand , signifying everything , the room , exquisite in its stark arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , the single orchid in a slender vase . Mr. Choe listened with sympathy . He was well aware ofp157the nuances of her life , and he knew what she meant . Before too many years her voice would lose its lovely timbre , her face would lose its smooth-cheeked beauty , and then she would no longer be an artist in her own right . She would become merely the madam of a house of prostitutes . " I quite understand , " he said . A thought crept into his mind , not , it is true , for the first time . If Kim Soonya closed The House of Flowers and began an entirely decorous life , it would not be impossible that he would take her as his wife . People never expect a second wife to be of the stature of the first . Moreover , she had a certain distinction as an artist , a singer , a musician of some achievement , and this lent her an aura . Say what one might , the influence of the Americans had been liberalizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , were sent on goodwill tours to Asia , the Americans expected them to be received with honor . There was also the possibility now that the half-breed boy , looking so American , would be removed safely to the other side of the world . Without the boy , the clear proof that she had once had an American lover , there would be no evidence . He could take Soonya into his house without private worry . He coughed delicately behind his hand before he spoke . " I advise that you send the child to his father , " he said . " This leaves your reputation entirely clean . You have been wise to keep him hidden with your mother . I take it for granted that no one knows of his relationship to you . "  | " No one , " she said . " He has come here only once and was then only a servant . " " Ah , " he said , relieved . " Fortunately he resembles his father , not you . The coarse American blood always prevails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever is offered to you , even though it is less than you deserve for all you have suffered . " He allowed himself to look at her with a hint of tendernessin his handsome eyes as he continued . " I have plans for you  --  plans for myself . There are possibilities . Once the boy is across the seas , you should forget him . You must forget all your past and think only of the future . You are very lonely . So am I. " He felt he had said enough and he rose . Soonya rose , also . She understood fully what he meant to convey , and she was grateful , though sad . Indeed , she knew that as long as she lived she would have hours of sadness . She was a warmhearted woman and while she respected Mr. Choe , she knew she could never love him . Once , long ago , a young American had wakened her womanhood , and now she was compelled , for punishment , to measure every other man against that one . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years that he would come back . Now she knew he never would , for in his stead he had sent his wife , and the wife was beautiful . It was a strange golden sort of beauty , but it was beauty . She yielded to it , acknowledging its power . Her own grace , her own submissivenature , had not been enough to hold him . Perhaps American men , themselves so free , so imperious , so demanding , could love only their own strong women . Per-P159haps they wanted love to be a war and not a deep , enduringpeace . She did not reply to Mr. Choe but she followed him to the door , and there they parted , she bowing deeply to him again and again , and he acknowledging these bows with an inclination of his head.  |p164Christo|pher  much good advice , and in English , so that it could be understood by all . " Obey father , " she told him . " Also obey Mrs. Winters . She is father 's honorable wife . Remember how I teach you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No sitting before father . Also make him happy every day your good schoolwork . In morning take tea to father always first . At eating wait he is eating . Remember all things I talk you . " She had spoken in English before Laura , to signify that she had carefully trained her son for his father , and Kim Christopher had listened , nodding , but saying nothing . Nothing did he say until the jet aircraft was high above the earth , and then he had turned to Laura with a single word . " Mother . " She had only smiled at him , but with sudden tears in her eyes . Now he looked up at his father . He bowed and waited for his father to speak first . " Hello , there , " Chris said . He was embarrassed as he looked down at the slight boy  --  his son , indubitably . His face  --  impossible to deny the likeness , and his heart beat strangely fast . " Very tall man , " Kim Christopher observed amiably . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Laura took Kim Christopher 's hand . " Well , where do we go from here ? " she asked , making her voice as casual as possible . " I 've taken a suite at a quiet place out of town . It 's right on the beach at Laguna , " Chris said . " We can talk things over . I 'm taking a couple of days off to get acquainted  --  even with you ! Your letters have been patchy . There 's ap165lot of catching up on both sides . Things are getting hot at home . I 'll have to evade reporters even out here , but I brought Berman along for that . It would be death and destruction to have bad publicity . Let 's get out of here now . Berman will get your bags . Here , give me the checks . " She felt Kim Christopher 's hand grow warm in hers and she released it . Chris was walking fast as he talked . " Keep up with us , Kim Christopher , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chris 's stride , but it was long and fast for a child . Chris seemed to have forgotten the boy as he led them toward the entrance . Here Berman waited for them . He put out his hand to Laura . " Welcome home , Mrs. Winters , " he said . He glanced at the boy and away again . " I 'll take the baggage checks , Mr. Winters . " " Does the boy understand much English ? " Chris inquired . " No , " Laura said . " Little , " Kim Christopher put in , smiling . Impossible not to see the bravery in that smile , and Chris smiled back . " You 'll learn , " he said . " You 'll learn quickly at school . " " School ? " Laura asked . " Explanation later , " he said . She could only wait . Two hours later in the hotel suite he faced her . In an adjoining room Kim Christopher was asleep after a hot bath and breakfast.  | " I 've already made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " If I had known that you would not let him come home with us , " she said , " I 'd have left him with his mother . He 'd have had one parent , at least . " She had bathed and breakfasted , too . Now in a rose-pink negligee , she looked beautiful but not tender , he told himself . He had taken her in his arms and she had resisted him , gently but firmly . " What have you decided about the boy ? " she had asked . Thus it had begun , this argument which might have been a quarrel except that each knew the other 's love . But love must wait , she had so decreed , and he could only comply , half angry that it must be so , and yet laughing at her , too . " I 'd say you 're holding out on me  --  damn you , sweetheart  --  toget your own way , whatever that is , except that I know you are n't that sort . " This he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bath fresh as a rose and had put him aside when he took her in his arms . She had cried out in indignation . " Chris , shame on you for saying such a thing ! It 's just that I ca n't put my mind to  --  to  --  " " To anything until you have what 's on your mind settled ! I know , I know . " The argument continued , and in the midst of those idyllic California surroundings which Chris thought he had so carefully chosen for the renewal of their love . They were outside now on the private deck of the suite . Itp167opened on a small sandy beach , beyond which rolled the gentle waves of the Pacific Ocean . Sky and sea were blue , the waves touched with the barest ripple of white as they rolled toward the shore . Right and left , mountains of dark rock jutted into the sea . A proper setting , he had told himself , romantic and isolated . He had missed her horribly . She was lying on a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held it . " My dearest , " he said , " if you let this child come between us  --  " " He is not between us , " she said . " He is simply here . What shall we do with him ? " " We are putting him in school . " " And then ? " " One thing at a time . " " All right , put him in school . Where ? " " At the Waite School in New Hampshire . It 's the best of the small private schools . " " And the holidays ? " " They always have boys there over the holidays  --  parents in Europe and so on . And he can have extra tutoring then , to help him catch up . " " It 's an orphanage , " she said . " It is not . " " He 'll be an orphan , I tell you . I still wish I 'd left him with Soonya . As it is  --  oh , Chris ! " " Darling , you feel everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea . No real education , no chance  --  nothing ! He 'll get the best here  --  "  | " Except a home and his father . " He rose , suddenly angry . " All right , I give up ! I 'll withdraw from the race . Let 's just settle down somewhere with the boy . It will have to be a strange place where I can begin again , where it wo n't matter . " " I can always take him back to his mother , " she said . He got up and leaned on the balustrade , gazing out over the glittering sea . Now he turned to her . " No , you ca n't . " " Why not ? " " For the same reason that you went to Korea in the first place to find him . I recognize my obligation . I acknowledgethat I am his father . I know that I have a duty to him . But I do not believe that my duty requires that I give up my whole life to him , all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ambition . I can not think of one person now , Laura . I could not even if he were your son and mine . You ask too much . " He was impassioned , and she responded with resolute calm . " I am not asking anything , Chris , except to know what you will do . Now I know . But I wish I did n't . I wish I had never known about him at all . I wish you had kept your secrets to yourself . " Here she fell into silent and unexpected weeping , she who never wept , and he could not bear it . Until this moment he had not realized the enormity of what he had done so many years ago . Taken apart , it was nothing , a young man 's loneliness , a young man 's need , a young man  --  a young man.  |p169He  went to her impetuously , he took her in his arms and held her while she wept , his own heart aching . " Forgive me , forgive me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet on her ' cheeks . " It 's not you I 'm thinking of , Chris . I understand about you . I 'm not blaming you for what 's past . I would n't think of it , because I do understand how it happened . I do n't even mind . If only there had n't been a child , I could have laughed  --  almost . But he 's here . He 'll be here between us as long as we live  --  wherever he is . " Her head drooped upon his shoulder . He held her long and close . There was nothing he could say , nothing . The child indeed was here . Back in Philadelphia , the house , their home , was silent when at last they entered it , but it was midnight and silence was only to be expected . She came in alone while he paid the cab and brought in the bags , and she wandered into the living room , touching the electric light at the door . Clean and empty . Greta had kept the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris had not told her what day they would return , for he did not know . They had not known until they left Kim Christopher at Waite this morning . Then Chris had chartered a small plane and they had flown home . She sat down now and took off her hat and gloves . This house was hers , here she belonged , and she had come back to it , but without joy . She felt strangely bereaved , or perhaps only troubled . She had not imagined that it would be so hard to leave Kim Christopher . He had somehow entered her life to stay , not as ap170duty any longer , but as a human being dependent upon her . Yes , she , too , could not escape the involvement ; for Chris , though dutiful , was impatient to have the child settled so that he could be  --  not forgotten , but put into his niche . She heard Chris close the front door and lock it . Then he came into the room . " It 's good to be home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a man could so miss a woman ! " He leaned to kiss her , tipping her head with her chin cupped in his hand . She returned his kiss . She knew she could not act alone . She could not bear to live without him , or live with him in anger . Nor did she know what should be done about the child . Chris had in those few days convinced her not so much by what he said as by the way he had conducted himself toward his son that only through the father and with him could the child 's life be set on its right path . For after that first uneasy day , Chris had won her by his behavior . He had treated Kim Christopherwithout sentimentality but with warmth ; and by the time they reached the school they were even laughing together over the boy 's attempts to enlarge his vocabulary . " What this , Father ? " Kim Christopher 's eternal question , emphasized by a pointing forefinger , inquired of everything in sight . Food and vehicles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed voraciously every experience of those few days . They had spent a day at Waite buying clothes , talking to the headmaster , James Bartlett , arranging for a tutor for Kim Christopher 's English , and meeting Chris/topher 's roommate , a pale blonde boy from New York whose parents were getting a divorce in Paris . " I am impressed with the lad , " Dr. Bartlett had said when they left . This was a kind man , Laura thought , a slightly harassed man , as the headmaster of a boys ' school must be , but not absentminded or abstract in his approach . If he saw a resemblance between the two Christophers he did not mention it . He accepted casually Laura 's explanation that she had taken a trip to Korea , had been moved by the child 's loneliness , and had brought him back to the United States with her . She added that she had told the boy to regard them as his parents . Since they had no children in the house in Philadelphia , they thought Christopher could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed easily . " Oh , quite . It will be only a matter of weeks . We had a boy here from Rio who spoke not a word , and you 'd be surprised  --  " He shouted and a smiling brown-skinned boy with startlingblue eyes came forward . Dr. Bartlett rumpled his dark curly hair . " I 'm just saying how quickly you 've learned English and you must help Christopher , here , not to be dis-couraged . " " I 'll be glad to , sir , " was the quick rejoinder , and he seized Christopher 's arm and made off with him . A moment later they were pitching a baseball between them . It had not been easy this morning , nevertheless , to explain to Kim Christopher . Somehow they had not been able to convey to him that school , which he had expected ,  |p172was  to mean their departure . When they were ready to leave he prepared to leave with them . She had then to explain . " Kim Christopher , you stay here . " He had looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " I go , " he said . Chris had made the next effort . " We 're coming back , boy . We 'll come often . " Kim Christopher transferred his hold . He took his father 's hand in both his hands and in silence had pleaded , his eyes filling with tears . " Chris , " Laura breathed . " I ca n't take this . He 's only just acquired a couple of parents , and now he 's losing them . He does n't understand . I feel responsible . " Dr. Bartlett interposed . " I advise your simply leaving . We will help him to adjust . It will take a few days , but not longer . " In the end they had , therefore , simply to leave . They had torn their hands away , he clinging to one and the other , and without looking back they had fled , leaving him to Dr. Bartlett . Now in the empty living room , where there were no flowers , Laura , remembering , rose abruptly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out the lights . Then , his arm about her , they mounted the stairs together . " I wish I had looked back , " she sighed . " Now , darling , " he pleaded . " He 's really very small , " she said . " Please , darling . " " I know . " She heaved a great sigh . " I know , I know . "  |p173What  she knew was that she had to forget , and that she never could . She must return to Chris , and she knew she never could  --  not with her whole heart , and what was the use of a piece of a heart ? But she would do her best . Perhaps later , when he had won his race . Meantime she must return to being his wife . Kim Christopher had seen them go without believing what he saw . He had trusted them , he belonged to them , he thought , and now they were leaving him here with strangers . It was not possible , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cab , and was about to run after them except that his hand was held in a firm strong clasp from which he could not break . " Steady , Christopher , " the man said . He did not know who the man was , although he knew his name  --  Dr. Bartlett . He was a tall thin man , not young , not old . He looked kind , but so had Mr. Choe looked kind . Yet Mr. Choe had disappeared from his life , as all were now disappearing . He thought of his mother , even of his old grandmother , who at the last moment had pushed him out of the house . " Go , go , go , " she had said . " Go to your American father ! " It was finally she who had made him glad to leave . How many times she had beaten him across his back ! " You eat , eat , eat , " she had screamed at him . And his mother , his beautiful mother , who would not allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been foolish to leave that country where at least he understood what people said to him . Suddenly all his courage left him , the courage that had made him give backp174curses to those children in Korea who had called him Round Eyes , American , Foreigner ; the courage that had made him love his mother when he knew that she could not love him , now or ever ; the courage that had made him leave all he knew and come to this far country with a white woman who was his father 's wife . And when he had met his father he thought that he was safe . He was not . . . he was not . He was alone again . And here , turning around , he leaned against the tall stranger and broke into terrible weeping , great shaking sobs that split his heart into pieces . Words burst out of him , Korean words that no one could understand . " I am lost  --  I am lost , " he sobbed . Dr. Bartlett stooped . It was true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childless life he accepted all children without understanding any of them very well . He simply knew that people brought their children to him , these little boys , and left them . How they could do it he did not know , but here they were , and something had to be done about them . They had to be fed and housed and taught their lessons , and he employed people to help him do this , requiring of them with the utmost strictness that they be kind and truth-telling . " Come , come , Christopher , " he said , rubbing the spiky dark hair of the sobbing boy . " They 'll be back , you know . Sooner or later parents always come back . And you 'll have a good time here with the other boys . Give yourself a few days and you 'll be quite happy . You 're hungry , I daresay . Come along and have something to eat . " It was his usual panacea for sobbing little boys , something to eat and another boy or two to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He had a good housekeeper , Mrs. Battle , who was enormously good at making things boys liked to eat , and he led Kim Christopherto the big kitchen . There she sat , drinking a cup of tea . " Here 's a new boy , Mrs. Battle , " he said . " He needs cheering up . The usual thing , except that he does n't speak much English . He 's come all the way from Korea . Mr. and Mrs. Winters brought him . They live in Philadelphia but he 's to stay with us . There 's a story in it somewhere , but which one of the boys does n't have a story ? Well , anyway , I suspect he 's hungry . Christopher , his name is . " " Lucky I 've just made sugar cookies , " she said . " Leave him to me , Dr. Bartlett . " She drew a chair to the table and poured another cup of tea and put cookies on a plate . " Sit down , Christopher . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she smiled at him while Dr. Bartlett tiptoed away . They sat there , then , the two of them , saying nothing to each other , for what was there to say , she thought , if the poor child could speak no English ? She put a cookie on his plate and then another when he had finished it . The tea was hot and strong and he seemed to like it , poor child . His tears ceased , he became quiet and at last relaxed and even sleepy . She rose . " Come lie here on the settee , lovey , " she said . She patted an old couch , its springs worn from her own weight . " Lie down here and let Mrs. Battle cover you up . Take a little nap and you 'll feel ever so much better when you wake . " He understood what she meant if not what she said , andp176he lay down and let her cover him with an old knitted afghan of many colors . In a few minutes he fell asleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The House of Flowers , Soonya was superintendingthe packing of her possessions . Her departure was quiet but absolute . Mr. Choe had been entirely correct . The change had been made through a friend of his , a Mr. Joshua Pak , a wealthy businessman , who was now increasinghis assets by privately cancelling his contracts with Americans and substituting for them new contracts with Japanese firms under the terms set by recent trade treaties with Japan . He disliked Americans who were righteous and could not be corrupted , and he despised Americans who could be corrupted . Korea was full of both kinds . With the Japanese there was never any question of corruptionone way or the other . Business was the only consideration . Mr. Pak was filled with secret fury , moreover , because the stupid young Americans in the armed forces had spawned so many half-breed children . Korean girls were in it for business reasons , but the men were spendthriftsand fools . He advocated in safe places that such children be strangled at birth , or if they lived that at least the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pure , and it was intolerable that it would not remain so . Through the centuries they had not mingled even with Chinese or Japanese . Why then should this present miscegenationtake place ? Exchanging confidences with Mr. Choe , he had said boldly , " Such children must be taken away from our country , even though it is only to cast them into the sea . "  |p177Mr  . Choe was not so severe . He had been softened somewhat by his years in America , but he too agreed that the children should be sent to the land of their fathers , for they belonged there . Americans knew nothing of purity of race . Behold their many colors in skin and hair and eyes ! Mr. Choe had also taken the occasion before he asked a favor of his friend to say that he himself had been instrumental in returning a half-American boy to his father in the United States , the mother being one of the women in The House of Flowers . He had then proceeded to ask his friend the favor of being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed since Mr. Choe 's factoriesturned out certain products which he wished to contract for , and favor deserved favor . Hence , on this fine autumn morning an American limousine waited outside at the gate . Inside her room Soonya was gathering her last possessions . There remained the private drawer in her dressing table which she kept always locked . Sending her maid from the room now , she unlocked it and took out the pictures of the father of her child . Gazing into his handsome face she had a vague stir at her heart . She had lied to Mr. Choe in telling him that she had no love for the American , and there were times when she believed her lie . Now , however , she knew her own heart . Were they together once more , a dream she had at last relinquished , she would have loved him again . This man was her love and there would be no other . Between them , even before they could understand each other 's language , there had been a flow of feeling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had . His wife was second in his heart . Soonya was compelled to believe thatp178also . Otherwise she could not now proceed to Mr. Choe 's house , which she must do , for the years were passing and she was at her height , professionally . In a year or two she would begin to show her age , and another younger and more beautiful woman would take her place . But as the wife of Mr. Choe , though only a second wife , she would have position as long as she lived . She gazed for an instant more at the handsome pictured face . No , she must keep no photographs , not in another man 's house . She hesitated only for one more moment , then lit the candle that stood in its lacquered stand on her table , and holding the picturesin the flame she watched them kindle and curl and turn to ash . One more picture remained  --  that of the child , three or four weeks old . She had held him in her arms , and he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied it , it was upon her own face that she gazed . How young she was , and yes , how beautiful ! The child , too , had been perfect , and dressed in American clothes . He had bought them somewhere and brought them with him one day , and she had put them on the child and together they had posed for the picture in the tiny rock garden of the small house he rented . The child had grown and changed , and now it seemed to her that this baby whom she had tenderly loved was not the boy , thin and foreign-looking , who had gone away with the American wife . Somewhere along the way she had ceased to love the child . Perhaps , unable to hate the father , she had visited her hatred upon the child he had left behind him . To the father she had felt close , his flesh and hers united ; but the child was a stranger , anp179interloper for whom there was no place . She held this snapshot also to the flame . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm of her hand , and rising , she went to the shoji that opened into the garden . Lifting her hand , she blew the ash away and watched it drift through the air to settle on moss and rock and to float upon the surface of the pool . And she knew as she did so that her memories could not be so easily swept away . Deep within herself was the knowledge that she had taken a stranger into her most secret being , a man from a foreign land who remained a foreigner and who would never return . But she had had him in her , and that part of him which she had received had taken on a life of its own in the form of a child . Henceforth , however great the distance between man and woman , the child lived as a permanent record of their union . Nothing could destroy that child . Even his death could not destroy him , for he had lived and would live , though he died , for what had been once could be again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women . Nothing was inviolate where men and women were concerned . The child , moreover , carried in himself disparate halves and in his lifetime he would impart disparity to other children yet to be born . Such thoughts were in Soonya 's mind . She was a woman neither simple nor stupid . She was capable of deep feeling , out of which these thoughts arose like birds skimming the surface of the sea . She put them away , however , and looked about to see that nothing was left in this room that had belonged to her . Then , seeing there was nothing , she summoned her maid and they went out of The Housep180of Flowers and entered the waiting limousine and were driven away . " Mistress , " the maid at her side whispered . " Are you not afraid ? " " Afraid of what ? " Soonya asked . " To live in the house of Mr. Choe , and such a big house as I hear it is ? " " Certainly I am not afraid , " Soonya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In her heart , however , she was afraid , for she never had been a wife , and now she must be one , whether she liked it or not . " What 's your letter ? " Chris asked . They were at breakfast on this summer 's day . Greta was setting glasses of orange juice before them , and the fragranceof bacon and coffee hung upon the soft morning air . " It 's Wilton , from the laboratory , " she said . " He wants me to come back full time , to supervise his researchers in the algae project . He 's especially interested in Euglena . " Chris laughed . " Euglena  --  at least I know it 's not a girl ! " She smiled . " Not a girl , but interesting for all that . It 's the green stuff one sees on a pond of fresh water in warm weather  --  an autotroph . " She lifted her eyebrows , waiting for his question . Earlier in their married life he would have asked it , interested as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " No , I 'm not asking what that is , " he replied to her expression . " Then I 'll tell you anyway , " she said . " It 's a plant that needs nourishment the way an animal does . Instead of giving out vitamins as plants usually do , vitamins have tobe given to them . Euglena , for example , needs Vitamin B12 . " " So ? " he said . " So Euglena research may help us find answers to questionsabout human anemia or even leukemia . " But he was not listening , she could see . He was thinking his own thoughts . " I wish you would n't go back to the laboratory just yet , " he said . " But what shall I do with myself , Chris ? " " Be decorative for a bit  --  as my wife ! I 've got to do active campaigning . I need my beautiful wife at my side . " " I 'm not good at handshaking . You know that . " " I 'll do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember your model technique ! It was devas-tating . " " So long ago ! " " Only a couple of years . Before you got to be Dr. Laura de Witt , Ph.D . in all this scientific stuff ! " " You 've been patient . " " I 've been proud . It is n't every governor who has a double-barrelled wife . Beauty and brains ! " She took up another letter , and recognized the handwriting . " We have a letter from Christopher . He 's beginning to write amazingly well . "  | " What has he to say ? " " It 's to you , as usual . Shall I  --  " He nodded . She opened it and read it aloud : " Dear Father : I am writing you today . Now I can swim and dive . Also play baseball and so forth . Now the boys are going home for summer . When am I going home , please ? Shall you tell me ? Few boys will be here soon . I am hoping I see you every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks . Your son , Christopher . " " Nice kid , " Chris said . They seldom spoke of the boy . What was there to say ? Neither had the answer to the question that remained in the heart of each of them . She knew that Chris thought of the boy , if not constantly , then often . He was here , a living presence in their house , however far away he was . " Will you answer the letter , Chris ? " " You answer it . " " What about the summer ? " " I inquired about that when I chose the school . There 's a summer session  --  sort of a camp . A good many of the boys do n't go home  --  parents divided or traveling  --  that sort of thing . Military officers whose wives go with them , but they have the children where it 's safe and they can go to school . " She put the letter into its envelope . " One of these days he will not accept my excuses for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write to him ? " " Please , Laura ! " She looked up , startled by the anguish in his voice , and immediately softened . " Chris , forgive me . It 's just that wep183did bring him here , you know . He 's in a strange country , among strange people . " " We 'll go and spend Christmas with him . " " 0 Chris , will you ? " " Why not ? Besides , you would n't be happy just with me . We 're not two any more . " " Only because  --  " " I know , I know . It 's my fault . " " I was n't going to say that . Only because he 's so alone . If you 'd decided to leave him with Soonya , I 'd have put him out of my mind . " " Well , I would not have ! Letting him grow up in that goddamned country  --  " " It 's Soonya 's country . " " Shall we send him back ? " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " He put down his knife and fork . " You really mean that ! " " Yes , I do . He must have someone near him , Chris , someone who loves him . " " Laura , you exasperate me . He 's getting an education , he 's fed , he 's housed . He 's growing up in a country of opportunity . He can be anything he wishes to be . I 'll see that he gets the best . " " Everything except what he needs most  --  a home . He flung down his napkin . " All right ! I give up . I 'll tell Berman I 'm withdrawing . We 'll spend the rest of our lives taking care of this boy . " " That would be final . So final that I would see a divorce in the offing . "  | " Laura ! " " You would n't be fit to live with . " " I ca n't say I enjoy this life . " " Meaning me ? " They had quarreled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , bright blue with anger , and felt her heart chill . How could she explain that there was a trouble now which went deeper than the matter of the boy ; explainthat the real agony was the intolerable doubt that he might not be quite the man she had thought he was ; that he might evade the truth instead of facing it , take less responsibility than full manliness required , a fall of pride in him she could not bear ? Not fair of me , she told herself . I 'm measuring him by my own demand . If the boy were mine , would I acknowledgehim if it meant giving up what I hold most dear ? But with her , " most dear " could mean only Chris . If she had had a child born out of wedlock , for example , a child she had left in an orphanage , and if she had felt sure that Chris could not accept the child , would she have told him ? Or kept silent forever ? No answer to this , for there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss was not of a person but of his highest ambition . Nor was the ambition only for himself , she knew . He was too well born for that , too beautifully educated . From the old Quaker stock he had inherited the tradition of service . He wanted power , yes , but he wanted to be a good governor because the people had the right to honesty and devotion in their administrators . His every waking hour since he grew up , since he 'd finished law school , had been concentrated on planningp185reforms and improvements for the state . Try them out in the state , he had said , and so find out what would work one day for the nation . He never added the words , " when I am President , " but they were there in the silence and they both knew it . Only last night he had got out of bed and prowled about the room , then had waked her to listen to his latest idea for tax reform . She listened , admiring the resonant voice , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , persuasive speech . " I do so believe in you , Chris , " she had said . He had come to her then , had taken her in his arms , and in the torrent of their mutual love , it had been dawn before they slept . Yet now , only a few hours later , they were quarreling . She loved him none the less , and yet she knew a flaw had been revealed . He had not told her of Soonya . That she could forgive , but he had not told her of the boy , and that , somehow , she could not forgive . For the boy was innocentlyborn . By no will of his own he had been called into life , and whatever the means , he had the right now to live , and not a hidden , secret , shameful life , but a life in freedom of spirit . Yes , there was a loss , but she could not lay her hand upon it . Chris simply did not stand quite as tall as once he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was all she had . " Chris , forgive me ! I love you so . " He melted at once . " God knows I love you ! There 's nothing in my life but you , no one ! I want everything for you , sweetheart ! I want you to be proud of me. "  |p186Two  steps and he had her in his arms . " Excuse me ! " A voice at the door and they sprang apart . Berman stood there , his face flushing . " I 'm sorry to interrupta love scene , especially between a husband and wife  --  a rare sight these days . " Chris laughed and stepped back . " But quite legal ! Come in , Joe . Pour him a cup of coffee , Laura . As a matter of fact  --  " he sat down again at the head of the table , and she took her place decorously opposite , "  --  matter of fact , Joe , we were just about to decide how my wife could help in the campaign . Sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what I came to see you about , Mr. Winters . We 've got the women organizednow  --  clubs and so on  --  and they all want to hear you , Mrs. Winters . I 'll book you as close as you 'll let me , beginning with the local groups here in the city and then fanning out over the state . " She was startled . " They want to hear Chris , not me , and what shall I talk about ? " Berman smiled at her . " We must save him for the men , so what are you interested in ? " Chris broke into fresh laughter . " Do n't ask her that ! She 's interested in the oddest creatures  --  deep-sea things -- plants that are animals and animals that are plants . Women will think she 's drunk , but they 'll listen . " Berman looked puzzled . " You 're kidding . " Laura came to his rescue . " What I am is a marine pharmacologist . Do n't let Chris tease you , Mr. Berman . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " That , too . That 's how I earned my first money after college . " " Stick to being a model , honey , " Chris said joyously . " It 's becoming . Do n't be scared , Berman . " " I 'm not , " Berman protested . " You can talk to the university women about your scientific side , Mrs. Winters , and to the others about being a model . " " Where do I come in ? " Chris inquired . " Oh , you 'll come in everywhere she goes . The women will want to know what sort of husband you make , whether you help with the dishes at night and whether you like children  --  " He broke off . " It 's been a great disappointment that we have n't had children , " Laura said quietly , unperturbed . He was not to think it made any difference . " She can do it , " Chris said . " Book her up , Joe . We must get the women started . Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " All set . " She rose from her seat quietly , so quietly that they did not notice that she had left the room . Outside , summer was coming into bloom in the walled garden . There was a precious quality to a city garden . In this small sparhadplanted carefully a few graceful shrubs , a corner of rose bushes , a mimosa tree fringing the wall between their house and the next . A fountain , two white iron seats and a round table between completed the living picture she had made . Strange how she kept remembering the landscape of Korea , the wide stretches of bare mountains loomingp188above the streets of Seoul , the curving roofs of the palaces , the crowds , the children 's faces , the faces of the special children  --  the ones like Kim Christopher , the ones her eyes had learned so soon to search for and to find . She sat down on one of the iron seats . A bird sang suddenly out of the sycamore tree that leaned over the brick wall , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she scarcely heard , her mind far away . Today the life in that ancient city of Seoul , the old strong life of the past , the people of Korea , was meeting , head-on , the new life , the fierce alien life of young American men . And now , unexpectedly , the face of Lieutenant Brown floated up out of her memory . A tense face , she recalled , tense with the decency of selfrepression , the control of his sexual instincts exhausting him as much , and perhaps more profoundly than , license . Who knew ? How could she blame her Chris , her mercurial , loving , gay Chris , whom she could not have loved so passionately had he been like Lieutenant Brown ? How could she blame him for falling in love , even for a while and not forever , with so beautiful a girl as Soonya ? She heard the front door shut , with a bang as Chris always shut it , and knew that Berman was gone . She rose then and went in to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I will help you all I can , " she said . A light summer rain , the aftermath of a thunderstorm , was falling as she got out of a cab and walked into the lobby of The Towers . She was growing used to it now , thisp189meeting of women in their chosen haunts , today in the huge apartment of Mrs. Henry Allen . She was not afraid any more , and scarcely shy . She liked old Henry Allen for himself as well as for what he was doing for Chris . She felt him a rock of strength for Chris ; and for herself , too , a friend whom she could trust , though she told him nothing . He liked her and treated her with a courtesy , tender and delicate , that he might have accorded his daughter , had he had one . Six sons he had begotten , but no daughter , and though he was loyal to the wives of his sons , he missed a daughter . She was at ease with him , feeling in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no one else , certainly not with her own father , a college professor of the old school , kindly , forgetful of his children , whose interest in literature ended with the ElizabethanAge . There was comfort , too , in Henry Allen 's rectitude . No danger here of an old man 's furtive caresses ! She entered the elevator and mounted to the eighteenth floor . The door opened and Henry Allen stood there to welcome her . " Come in , Laura , " he said . " They 're all here  --  all the old guard , the bankers ' wives , the wives of hereditary Quakers like me , the hoarders of gold . They wo n't part with a penny unless they have to , and we must see to it that they have to , you know . You must make them see how a new conservative , dynamic and intelligent man like Chris can save their country from the things that scare them  --  from all the things they call creeping Communism . You 'll know how to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the young rightists of whom Chris is such a190 THE NEW YEAR THE NEW YEAR 191superior , such a forward-looking representative . The old lady under the purple tower of a hat  --  she could underwritethe whole campaign dinner here if she would . I want her to do it so that I can put my pittance into tours for Chris  --  a swing around the state , the farmers and all that  --  every county seat , you know  --  and then maybe a trip around the world to give him background . Every man needs that , these days . " She followed him into the opulent drawing room where upon small gold chairs were seated a hundred expectant ladies . She met their appraising eyes with calm , smiling just enough but not too much . Yes , the modeling helped her very much . Stance , aloofness , poise , presence , she used them all with practiced grace . And she knew her women . She must not rouse their jealousy by being too sure of herself . She must approach them with young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself only as the wife of a rising politician , she must be ready at the end of her short speech , for she knew better than to talk long , to leave time for questions , for she had learned to make her points there . Mrs. Allen rose to introduce her , a stout kindly figure in gray silk . " We women always want to know what a candidate 's wife is like , do n't we ? And it is not often that one is so pleasant to introduce as the one we have with us today , Mrs. Chris Winters . You 've seen her picture many times in our papers , for she 's a busy young woman , accompanyingher husband everywhere . But for most of us this is the first time we have seen her as she is , by herself . " Diplomatically she omitted all reference to the model ,  |p191Laura  de Witt . There was something not quite solid about glamour . " And so , here she is , our future first lady . " Laura rose , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am only pretending to be used to this sort of thing , " she said . " The truth is that I 'm not used to it at all . I live quietly . We both do , actually , and I 'm here only because my husband has asked me to come here for him , since he is engaged elsewhere . So I am merely taking his place . He 'd have so enjoyed being here if he could have . I scarcely know how to begin  --  perhaps by introducing him to you . What 's he like ? Well , he 's six feet two and he has blue eyes that grow very bright and shining when he is interested in what he 's talking about or when he 's just angry . He plays a cracking game of tennis and he 's an excellent skier and a good horseman . We both like to ride . He likes golf but I do n't . He went to Harvard and was graduated with honors in economics . His first job was in a big New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he understood money , how to use it , how to take care of it , how to lease it as credit to business houses . And then he went back to Harvard to take a degree in law . He completed his military obligation in Korea and after that , well , he belongs to an old law firm here in the city . That 's the outside of him . At home he 's  --  " She hesitated , her head bent thoughtfully . Then she looked up and smiled at them . " How can I tell you what he 's like at home ? We have no children . We wish we had . He 'd make a good father , I 'm sure . He 's strong on discipline  --  conservative , logical , but fair . He 's always fair . "  |p192She  paused again . There rose before her , out of the atmosphere , the image of Kim Christopher . No , no , she must not think of him now . She faltered and then went on quickly . " Politically , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , and a good many other people do , too . " She went on , artful in her artlessness , and she knew the women were meeting her with warmth . She was honest , she wanted to be completely honest , and wished she could tell them about Kim Christopher , yet knew she had no right to tell what Chris himself would not . She ended her talk soon , and then met their questions with patience and some admiration . For the questions revealed that these women were astute , sheltered though their lives had been . They knew their city and their state , and when the time came for them to expand their knowledge of their nation and of the world , they would learn . Somehow she rememberedhere a story her father had told her long ago when he had come back from a year of study in China . " Those Chinese peasants , " he had said . " They ca n't read or write , but they are civilized and sophisticated . Only a few years ago they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modes of travel . Then the first railroads were built and with ease and total aplomb they climbed on trains with their produce in baskets hung on bamboo poles . Now they 're getting airplanes , and withoutamazement or hesitation , they step aboard , as I saw an old fellow do , with half a dozen chickens tied together by their legs . Up in the air we went and he smoked his brassbowledbamboo pipe and gazed out of the window asp193though he 'd been riding aircraft all his life . And my interpreter told me it was his first trip on anything faster than a donkey . Even the railroad had never come to his part of China . " She could imagine these plump , white-haired , and welldressedladies , whose world was the comfortable , opulent city in which they had been born and lived , stepping into the world over which Chris hoped to preside with the same sort of acceptance . " And that , " she said , in conclusion , an hour later , " brings me to the end of the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned from your questions  --  and thank you . " She turned and was about to sit down when Mrs. Allen put her hand on her arm . " Wait a minute , my dear , I want to introduce you again . Friends , I introduced you to Mrs. Christopher Winters , wife of our next governor  --  oh , yes , I 'm sure of that , dear  --  but now I want to introduce you to another young woman . This is also Dr. Laura de Witt , the distinguished young scientist , who is working with two of our very greatest scientists in the field of marine pharmacology . And if you do n't know what that is , do n't feel embarrassed , because I did n't know , either . I had to look it up . It has to do with finding new medicines from plants and animals in the sea . Is that right , my dear ? " It was Laura who was embarrassed , but the ladiesclapped their hands warmly and rose to find tea andcocktails . No one asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skillfully while shebalanced a teacup on her knee and ate a caviar sandwich . She paused an instant at the door , however , when shep194was taking leave . " How could you ? " she murmured reproachfullyto Mrs. Allen . " I 'm afraid they wo n't like me now. , , " My dear , " Mrs. Allen said resolutely , " it 's time we women were proud of women who have brains . " With this she kissed Laura 's cheek , opened the door and let her go . " Dear Father , " Kim Christopher wrote . " Next week is coming July Four . Big Day and fathers are coming , also mothers . I am hearing so . Please come to see rokit . Your loving son , Christopher Winters . " She handed the letter to Chris in silence . He read it . " Did this come today ? " " Yes . Shall I mix you a cocktail ? " " Please . Of course we ca n't go on the Fourth . I 'm makingthat big speech in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . You must be there with me . What 's rokit ' ? " " Rockets , of course  --  fireworks . " " Oh , yes . Too bad , but , well , I said we 'd go for Christmas . " " Here 's your cocktail . " Christmas is a long time from July for any child , she thought . But she was used to this now , or so she told herself . The campaign was in full swing and she admired Chris with heart and mind , smothering the small intolerable doubt in frantic activity . He was making one brilliant speech after the other . People were expecting more and more of him . " A man of courage , " they called him . He was facing unsolved issues , searchingp195for answers to the great questions , studying , learning about the countries even as far away as Asia , where most of the real problems were rising . No one knew , including Chris himself , how desperately she wished he would face the unsolved private issues too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of courage . Nagging at her memory was the story of Grover Cleveland , who , running for the Presidency , had said " Tell the truth " about the unfortunate boy he 'd been supporting for years . Was Chris less of a man than Grover Cleveland ? It was worth her life that he should not be . . . and worth his , too . " Sometime after Election Day I shall have to take a trip around the world , " Chris was saying . " Maybe during the Christmas holidays . That 's a dead space . You and I. " " But not over Christmas . We 'll be with Kim Christopherthen . " " We will . I said so . " Her mind was plotting while he talked . There were ten days before the Fourth . Dr. Wilton had begged her to come to the laboratory to look at a new marine microorganismhe had been able to grow in his experimental tanks . " I need your sharp eyes and quick mind , " he wrote . " The little beast  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time it  --  vegetable ?  --  contains chlorophyll , and it photosynthesizes . It may be a new screening device for anticancer agents  --  I hope and pray ! " " Chris , " she said now , over their cocktails , " shall you mind if I take a day off now and go up to the laboratories ? Wilton thinks he 's really found something new . "  | " Of course not , " he said with such quick generosity that she withheld her second question . And do you mind , she was about to ask , if I delay a day or so longer and go to see Christopher , since we ca n't go on the Fourth ? No , leave that unspoken . Perhaps when she was in the laboratory , bent over a microscope , it would not seem so urgent . " Thank you , Chris , " she said . " A small return , " he replied . " Very small indeed . Henry Allen said you bowled the women over the other day . They liked you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them credit for . " He came to her side and leaned over her and kissed her long and deeply . It was still exciting . A week later she spent two days in the laboratory , enjoying , after so many months , the delight of communion with minds like her own . She was more pleased because under the microscope she had been able to recognize the new organism as one of the dinoflagellates which she had once seen but had not analyzed in a mass of plankton from the Sargasso Sea . " Your relentless brain , " Dr. Wilton had grumbled . " Of course you 'd remember you had seen the damned thing  --  probably in your babyhood ! Do n't you ever forget ? " He was older than she , a slim spectacled man of no particular coloring , but rather a male man , she suspected , and so she merely smiled . Driving herself early the next morning along the parkway toward New Hampshire , however , it occurred to her that one of her difficulties perhaps was that indeed she never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of the hours she had spent with Kim Christopher , nor could she forget the changing looks upon his too expressive face , his disappointment when he found that he was not to be with his father , his brave silence and the glitter of tears in his eyes . No , her absorption in her work these last two days had not made her forget the boy 's urgent need . And , not forgetting , she had for the first time in her life consciously and wilfully deceivedChris . " Chris , " she had said last night over the telephone . " I sha n't come home tomorrow as I had planned . I am stayingon another two or three days . " " You 'll be late for the Fourth ! " he exclaimed . " No , I sha n't be . I 'll get in not a moment later than the midnight of the third , possibly the second . " " And be worn out the next day ! " " Not worn out the next day . " He had yielded to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of love . How right her decision had been was clear to her now after the long quiet day of driving alone . She had finished her task at the laboratories , leaving with her colleagues a brief clear statement of her conclusions , and with peace in her mind , the peace that only completed work , well done , could bring her , she had turned her inner attention to the matter of Kim Christopher . Slowly as the hours passed she had come to the conclusion that the situation could no longer be allowed to hang fire . The boy must either join them as Chris 's son , or she would take him back to Korea and his mother , that is , if she could so persuade Chris . Herp198mind quieted by at least this much decision , she drew in at sunset to the grounds of The Waite School for Boys . She had purposely not announced her coming . She wanted to see Christopher as he was , without the preliminary excitement of expecting her arrival . She wanted to come upon him wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening meal . She stopped at the main building , a colonial structureof white-painted wood with green shutters at the windows , and rang the bell . An older boy answered it . " Is Dr. Bartlett here ? " she asked . " He 's still in his office , I think , but he 's just about to go home , probably . " " Catch him for me , please , " she said . " Tell him it is Mrs. Chris Winters . " She had lingered in the hall only a moment when she saw Dr. Bartlett loping toward her , his long stride hastened by the surprise evident on his face . " Mrs. Winters ! " he cried . " Is something wrong ? " " No , " she explained , " simply that I thought I 'd drop by and see how Christopher is doing . " " Very well , very well , " he said . " Come in . I 'll send for him . " " May I just go to him wherever he is ? I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . " They found him in the library , otherwise empty at this hour . There on a window seat , catching the last of the evening light , he was reading a large book upon the sill . " Christopher , here is a surprise for you , " the headmastersaid . He looked up . She saw at once that he was thin , muchp199thinner than he had been . But when he leaped to his feet she saw also that he was much taller . " You come to see me ! " he breathed . To her horror he hesitated , and then , leaning his head against her shoulder he began to weep . She put her arms around him and held him and turned a reproachful look upon the surprised Dr. Bartlett . " Has he been unhappy ? " The boy answered for himself . He lifted his head and smiled through the tears wet on his face . " I am happy now , " he said . " You come to see me . Thank you . " " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course there has been some depression . After all , it 's a strange country for him , and in a manner you and Mr. Winters are still strangers to him . " They had not told him who the boy was , and though it must have been evident to the eyes of a wise headmaster , no questions had been asked and so no answers were necessary . Should she tell him the truth later , when they were alone ? He was still talking . " You must n't take these tears too seriously , Mrs. Winters . I 've been several times in Asia and indeed spent months in japan during the Occupation , and I remember that it is not thought a disgrace in Asia for a man to weep . Rather , it is considered a sign of sensitivity and feeling . Our Christopher has both these attributes , I have discovered . Of course he has problems , perhaps . " " We 'll discuss it , " she said with resolution . " Meanwhile , can you put me up for the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Christopher , sup/pose you take her to the East Room and then you may bring her to dinner with you . I 'll have your bag brought in , Mrs. Winters . Now I 'll leave you with your boy . After all , it is he you came to visit . " He left them , and she was touched that Christopher did not feel himself too old to clasp her hand as they went down the hall , noisy with crowding boys . Turning eastwarddown a corridor , he opened a door and followed her into the room , a pleasant place , she observed , all chintz and white organdy . She sat down in a cushioned chair and , putting out her hand , she drew the boy to her side . " Now let me see you , " she said . " You are tall , you are thin . Do you eat enough ? " He nodded , suddenly shy . To her surprise she saw his eyes fill again with tears . She said nothing , comprehending the inner tension , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this must not go on , she thought . " When is coming my father ? " he asked . " He is coming , " she said with determined cheerfulness . " And certainly we will come for Christmas . You know Christmas ? " He nodded . " Yes , Christmas , " she repeated . " Now tell me  --  " An idea sprang into her mind . She released his hand and motioned to a nearby chair . " Do you know how to ski ? " " I know what is , " he said , seating himself . " But I do n't know how is . " " Then you must learn , " she said . " Your father is a fine skier . It 's his favorite sport . When we come at Christmas time there will be snow on the ground and he will want top201take you skiing on the mountain yonder . The boys here all know how to ski , I am sure . And you will be a good skier , like your father . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes growing bright , and she was cheered . She went on , " I 'll see that you get a good ski teacher , and we 'll leave word for your skis and things . " " You skiing , too ? " he asked . " Yes , but not so well as your father does . " In such chatter they continued , and within the hour a gong sounded for dinner and they went into the dining hall . And then suddenly , at the table , seeing Christopher at another table , talking with other boys and eating with fair zest , she decided that she would not reveal the secret Chris wanted hidden . For how could she explain ? Her loyalty to him came first . She went with Christopher that night to a school play , a comedy of school life acted by the boys , and parted from him later at the door . Remembering how often he had laughed , she had bade him an easy goodnight . " We 'll have breakfast together , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The brightness faded from his face . " Goodnight , Mother , " he said , and giving a little bow he left her . She watched him walk down the corridor and when she could see him no longer , she closed the door . " I simply felt I had to see the boy and discover for myself whether he is happy  --  happy enough , that is , so that my conscience can rest , temporarily at least , for we haven'tp202solved anything . You know that , Chris ! " It was the next day . She had reached home late , nearly at midnight , and Chris had waited for her in the living room , surrounded by newspapers . Now , bathed and in her rose-silk negligee and further refreshed by a cool drink Chris brought her , they were sitting on the upstairs balcony on long chairs in the moonlight . " I do n't know what to make of your going off like that by yourself , " he said , troubled , as she could discern from the timbre of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and I would not have had the slightest idea where to find you . You probably did n't leave word even at the laboratory . No , I know you did n't , for Dr. Wilton called here this morning , wanting to get in touch with you . If he had called last night , before you called me , I 'd have been sick with fear . Such things happen these days , Laura , and you 've no right ! " " I know I should have told you I was going , but somehowI had to get off by myself . I had to see him . " " Why ? " " I could n't forget him . " " Can you now ? " " Not altogether , not until we answer the basic question of what we are going to do with him . " He gave a great sigh . " If only he did n't look like me ! " " He does look like you . And sooner or later the truth will catch up with us . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've won my race  --  " " Later it will be worse . The Governor ? A scandal ! President ? The scandal of the century ! Chris , you can'tp203have your cake and eat it too . You ca n't keep this boy on ice forever . You 've got to decide sometime whether fame 's worth more to you than a son . " And oh , if it is , she said to herself in silent agony , you 're a lesser man than I thought you were . You ca n't mean what you say about human values and live this kind of a lie . He was stung . " That 's not the choice , " he retorted . " Of course I want a son . I always have . " He did not see her wince and he went on , not knowing how relentlessly . " Under ordinary circumstances , if I were an ordinary man , I 'd take the son  --  this son  --  and declare my fatherhoodto the world . Fame ? I do n't give that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool can have it nowadays . Take off your clothes , you 've got it . " He turned and stared at her for a moment , and she could see the anger rising . " Is it possible that you , my own wife , ca n't understand me ? " " You want power , Chris , " she said softly , " of course you do , and you 'll use it well . I know that better than anyone . You 'll enjoy power , too . And there 's nothing wrong with that either . It 's just that  --  " " Laura ! " He waved his hand impatiently . " Do I have to spell it out for you , of all people ? I want to be governor of this state because I want to be a good governor for the people of the state . Not for my own sake , but because I see wrongs that I feel I know how to right . If possible , and I intend to make it possible , I shall one day be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame of that , either , but because I see wrongs in the nation that I believe I know how to right . Humbly I say it , and I shall need the help of many people  --  beginning with you , Laura . " Thep204sharp note reappeared , and she found it hard to bear , then faded into a moment 's silence before he went on in a voice husky with intensity . " I believe in myself . I know my motives are good . I want to leave the mark of greatness on my times  --  yes , and I will . Because I have , I think , found some remedies , some solutions . Now , I repeat , am I to throw all this away , throw myself away , throw away all I can do for the country , because I made a mistake when I was a boy in Korea ? " He swung his long legs around and sat sideways in his deck chair , searching for Laura 's eyes in the moonlight . But she held her face in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wonderful voice went on , still husky with feeling , but speaking now to her and to her alone . " I had thought I was going to die , Laura . That shakes you loose from your background . And I was surrounded by human misery . You were a world and a lifetime away . Desperately I needed someone to be close to  --  some simple , happy human warmth . In this I was no different from all the other young Americans , only I tried to keep away from all the cheap females who hung around the others . If I had not met Soonya , I would have stayed lonely . She was lonely , too . And though I met her at that dance hall , she was no cheap bar girl . From what you say , she still is n't , in spite of how she makes her living . You saw her quality yourself . She loved me , Laura , and needed me as I needed her . " He was almost whispering now . " And it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very young , very rootless , shallow , irresponsible . But it was not cheap . It was nothing , nothing at all , compared to myp205feelings about you . " She nodded , mutely . This she had been sure of from the beginning , and had all along found it comforting . But she could not yet look at him , the turmoil in her heart overwhelming her . " Well , so a child was born . It was the last thing I wanted . I felt terrible about it . I felt frightened and guilty . I admit there was a moment when I felt the wonder of having begotten a son . Yet I never thought of him as really mine . I never dreamed of bringing him here . He was born in Korea , he belonged in Korea . And then I thought  --  maybe I was just easing my sense of guilt  --  that it was a good thing that Soonya now had someone of her own to care about , because I was about to leave her and come home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris said quietly : " This is a wicked thing to ask another woman to understand , my Laura . It 's why I could n't tell you when I first came home . And I loved you so , my extraordinary wife with such beauty and intelligence and gentleness beyond anyone 's , that the Korean girl and her child faded into unreality . I had promised her nothing , we had given equally to each other , the past was past . And when I thought of her child at all , I thought of him as all hers . How could I know that she thought of him as mine , that according to Korean law he belonged to me ? " But our people would never understand all this in a man who wants to be governor  --  and someday President of the United States . People are cruel . I know how cruel they can be and how unjust . Am I to throw away the whole usefulness of my life by inviting their cruelty and injus/tice ? I do not intend to put myself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for myself , for then my life would also be ruined for them . Vanity ? It 's not . It 's dedication . " She was listening to him now . But he was , she knew , speaking no longer to her alone . He was making his case before some tribunal she could not see , the people , the nation , the world , or life itself . She understood and did not reply , could not have replied . Instead she rose and went to him and , kneeling beside him , she laid her head upon his breast . Under her cheek she felt his heart beating hard and strong . The months slipped past in a kaleidoscope of brilliant days and nights , and hours of weariness so exhausting that she felt sometimes as though she were in a strange land , among strange people whose language she could not speak . Her face felt stiff with smiling , her hand was sore with grasping the hundreds of hands outstretched to her , and her slender body grew fragile as she lost weight from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She and Chris were actors , acrobats , performers . She had to have new clothes , a constant change of gowns and frocks , for photographs made a garment obsolete in an evening , in a day . But Chris showed no sign of fatigue . He was exhilarated , upheldby exaltation , a sense of mission . While he strove to convince people that he was destined to be their leader and their governor , he also convinced himself the more thoroughly that no other man could serve as well . The times were troubled . World tensions , the war in southeast Asia , the strife between rising nations stirredp207tensions here at home . Tension was a fire consuming the nations , Laura thought . A burst of flame in a far place brought flickers of fire everywhere , creeping tongues of fire in dark places to burst out in fresh conflagration . " Chris , " she sighed at night . " The times are evil . I wish we had not been born in this age . " " Nonsense , " he said robustly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been . " " Tremendous possibilities , " she agreed , " but too large an if  --  if people do this , if people do that  --  " " I do n't intend to leave it to people , " he declared . " I intend to lead them . Step by step . . . to where I want them to be . " " Lead them where ? " " We 've had all we need of splinter groups , unions , brotherhoods , national groups , racial groups , everyone disaffected ! They 've forgotten to be Americans . To hell with the nation , as long as we get our benefits ! You watch  --  " he shook his finger at her with a cheerful grin . " Once I am in the seat of power you 'll see a benevolent dictator ! " " Berman wo n't like it if you say that in public , " she smiled . " There 's a time to speak and a time not to speak , and I sha n't be such a fool as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of patriotism now and make the definitions later when I 've won my battle . " What they all feared as the last days drew near was the gossip that might be taking place underground , where they could not combat it . Laura drew from somewhere inp208her compendious memory a story that her father had told of President Harding , and how his enemies had concocted the tale of his having Negro blood . Two generations ago , and yet prejudice was as virulent today , about mixed blood of any sort , as it had ever been . True , Harding had been elected , but under a shadow  --  whether of truth or of untruth . And Grover Cleveland , acknowledging his illegitimateson , had also been elected . But the gossip about Chris , if it existed , would pack double dynamite , explodingboth prejudices at once . Her anxiety now fully aroused , she refused to allow herself to visit Kim Christopheragain , and sent him only unsigned postcards lest some zealous reporter make the connection between them . As the autumn days drew on toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned red and gold and then ashen while their leaves fluttered in the chill winds , she became aware of a grim change in Chris . He was with Joe Berman from noon to dawn . Her fears finally burst into speech . " Chris , is something going wrong ? " " No , " he said shortly . " It 's just the machine . I 'd made up my mind to ignore it and then to fight it . But I am faced with the fact that if I want to be elected , I have to work with it . And the further it goes the uglier it gets . " " What does Berman say ? " " What he has said from the beginning  --  patronage jobs , contracts to the right men . People are lining up for the big final dinner , a thousand dollars a plate minimum , and those who give more have their hands out already for the top jobs . Somehow I thought I would n't have to capitu/late . " He shrugged uncomfortably . " But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know what a fine-tooth combing I get  --  my religion , morals , college escapades , business deals , campaign costs  --  everything is under a microscope , the evil pursuing eye of a political enemy ! This country is decent only during a full-scale war . Do you want to stir up a big one for me , Laura ? " He laughed grimly . " I 've spent over a million dollars on this election , and they ca n't discover a penny that is n't my own . Now they 're raising a stink because they say it 's undemocratic to spend one 's own money  --  limits government to the rich ! That 's because my honorable opponent came up out of poverty , whereas I am more lucky . Well , I 'll do what I must until election is over . Only a few more weeks to go ! " They had not in weeks mentioned Kim Christopher and they did not now . Dr. Bartlett was in his office , studying the report cards about to be sent to parents the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty boys in his school , and he kept watch over the progress of each . Now he heard a knock at the closed door . " Come in , " he called . The door opened and Kim Christopher stood there . It was near the end of the day and the headmaster had planned to leave the office early , for it was his wife 's birthday and he had a gift which he had not yet presented . A boy always came first , nevertheless , and especiallythis one . " Sit down , Christopher , " he said.  |p210Kim  Christopher sat down carefully on the edge of the straight chair on the other side of the desk . " Please , sir , do I trouble you ? " he asked . His English was improving so fast that in another term there would be no difficulty . Dr. Bartlett was beginning to believe that this slender boy , now growing too rapidly , would be one of his rare ones . " No trouble at all , Christopher , " he said cheerfully . He shuffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just examinedyour marks . Excellent ! I 'm very pleased . Still a little trouble with history and English , but your mathematics make up for it . " " I like mathematics . I am coming here today to ask if next term I may take some science , " Christopher said . Dr. Bartlett lifted his eyebrows . " Usually we postpone that until your second year . " " I like science very much . " " What science ? " " Physics , please . " Dr. Bartlett leaned back in his chair . " How old are you ? " " Twelve years , sir . " " Have you had a birthday since you came ? " " Yes , sir , last week . " " You did n't tell anyone ? " " No , sir . " " Now that was a mistake . We always like to know birthdays , and Mrs. Battle makes a cake . Promise me that next time you will tell . Here , I 'll just take down the date . "  | " October twenty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but each was aware of the omission . Kim Christopher was silent for a moment , unwilling to leave , and yet hesitant to stay . " Well , Christopher ? " Dr. Bartlett said kindly . " May I talk something more , sir ? " " Anything , my boy . " " About myself . " " What about yourself ? " Kim Christopher lifted his eyebrows . " Who I am , please ? " The headmaster looked at him quizzically . " You are one of my boys . " Christopher was patient . " For myself , who I am , sir ? " The headmaster rubbed his chin . How was he to reply ? " You tell me who you are , Christopher . " " I do n't know , sir . I think I am my father 's son , name is Winters , as you know . But now I am not sure . Maybe I am only mother 's son , name is Kim . " " Where is your mother , Christopher ? " He was treading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy was concerned no one else came first . " She is in Korea , sir . She is Korean woman . " " Tell me about her . " Kim Christopher flushed . " I am knowing too little . For me she is my mother , very beautiful face . I have also Korean grandmother , very old and not so nice , often angryp212with me for eating much food , and so on . But my mother is not so . She is quiet , but sometimes  --  " He shook his head and stopped . Dr. Bartlett prodded him gently . " Sometimes , what ? " Christopher looked away . " She hates me for some-thing . " " Surely not , " Dr. Bartlett said , perceiving a wound , very deep . " She hates me , " Christopher repeated . " I think it is for some reason because I am American , like my father . In Korea I am American . But here I am not sure . It seems here I am Korean . There I am called Round Eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who calls you that ? " Dr. Bartlett demanded . This at least he could stop . " Some boy . It is all right . It does n't too much matter . Only I like to know what I am , wherever . " The headmaster felt a familiar stab in the region of his heart . How often a boy came here to this room with a private pain ! It was not easy to be a boy , facing his own manhood with despair or puzzlement . And this boy 's bewildermenthad a special twist . How could he explain to Christopher what he was ? His own thoughts were not clear and he must feel his way . " You are interested in science , Christopher , so let me explain it in those terms , in terms at least of biology . Let me tell you about some valuable and interesting creatures in natural science . They are the new species , the connectinglinks , between the kingdoms . When they are in a vegetable environment  --  you understand environment ? "  | " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Good . Well , in a vegetable environment they function as vegetables , but in an animal environment they become animal . Mrs. Winters is an expert , I 'm told , on such creatures . Have you talked about your interest in science with her ? No ? Well , at any rate , these creatures are a connecting link between the kingdoms of creation . Or , speaking of environments , let me take the dragonfly . You know the dragonfly ? " " Many in Korea , sir . " " Here also . Well , they begin life in the water . I suppose they think  --  if they think  --  that they are water creatures . But one day they feel the urge to rise to the surface of the water . There they shed their skins and suddenly they find themselves with wings . They have never known wings before , but as soon as they have them , they soar away into the sunshine , never to return to their water beginnings . What I am trying to say is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdoms , between the species and now between the races . I call them valuable because they make a unity of creation . Divisions are not permanent . " " You are meaning me , sir ? " " Yes . Someday there will be so many like you everywherein the world that no one will call you names . It is a process of nature and it can not be stopped . You are important . You are essential . I can not tell you how you happen to be born one of these link people , because I do n't know your story . But someday you will know . Meanwhile , remember that you are valuable and that you have beenp214born for a purpose  --  nature 's eternal purpose , first to diversifyand then to unify , and so make of life a continuing , continuous stream . " Long words , which the boy could not possibly understand , he thought , and yet he would not explain . Let the young mind stretch and reach through its own puzzling ! Kim Christopher was looking at him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to him . He rose . " And now I must get home , Christopher , for my wife has a birthday and I like to have dinner with her . " Kim Christopher rose also , and bowing , he left the room . At the dinner table that night , after Dr. Bartlett had presented his gift of an antique brooch , he told the story of Kim Christopher . Mrs. Bartlett sat at her end of the table and listened , the brooch fastened at her neck . Sometimes he forgot her birthday , in which case she never mentioned it , his devotion being the atmosphere in which she lived , so that a birthday forgotten had no significance . Nevertheless , it was pleasant when he did remember , and never more pleasant than this evening . She listened , therefore , with more than her usual interest . " Of course it 's perfectly clear who the boy is , " she said with decision , which was her habit . " Chris Winters is certainly his father , and it happened during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why the boy turns up in this country just now , I would n't know , but why he is here with us , well , it 's perfectly plain . He came at a mostp215embarrassing time . A man who is running for governor in his state ca n't suddenly produce a half-Asian son , can he ? " Dr. Bartlett looked at her , thinking aloud . " And just when can such a man produce such a child ? " " That 's the difficulty , " she agreed . " There is no suitable time . If Winters is elected , well , how does a governor unveil to the public a son twelve years old ? If he loses  --  I do n't know  --  I do n't think he 'll lose . He 's making quite a swath nationally . He 's a brilliant orator and papers all over the country pick up his speeches . " Dr. Bartlett was grave . " What 's to become of this boy ? " " Hard to tell , " Mrs. Bartlett said cheerfully . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever , that 's sure . " In his own room Kim Christopher was considering carefullyhis own situation , dividing the favorable and unfavorableaspects . He had plenty to eat , he liked school , he had friends , he wore good clothes , he enjoyed sports , he had kind teachers and he could and did worship the headmaster , who , he wished , was his father . It would have been his good fortune to come to this strange country and find such a father . As it was , his feelings about his true father were mixed . He was drawn to the tall man who was still young , and yet he felt held off from him . Did he wish to return to his mother in Korea ? No , for she too held him away from her . His memory of childhood was made up of her sudden bursts of affection and her equally sudden and inexplicable moods of hatred and even cruelty . Here at least no one slapped him or bade him be gone . If he was not wanted , exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's wife , whom he liked to call Mother but who never called him her son , he did not know where she belonged in his life . She was always kind , but she too seemed not entirely his own . Moreover , what part had he in their lives , when he did not know where they lived and could not reach them except through letters ? Now there were not even letters . He lived in a sort of twilight . The simile occurred to him as he watched the sun set over the distant mountains and the darkness descend . As that same sun set behind Rittenhouse Square , Laura settled gratefully in front of the fire with a book . It was one of those rare moments when campaign pressures let up enough to allow her to indulge her private pleasure . She flipped to page 218 where she had left her marker . Her constant preoccupation with the problem of Kim Christopher'slife , yet to be solved , had driven her , for her own relief if not for a solution , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Most Dangerous Myth , The Fallacy of Race . " In this connection , " Ashley Montagu wrote , " it has been said that one can not get out of a mixture more than one puts into it . This is one of those facile generalizations which are too easily allowed to pass by the uncritical . When we combine oxygen and hydrogen , we obtain water . . . When we combine zinc and copper , we obtain an alloy , bronze , which has far greater strength , and numerousother qualities , than the unalloyed metals comprisingit ; that is certainly getting more out of a mixture than was put into it . When two pure bred varieties of plants orp217animals unite to produce offspring , the latter often show many more desirable qualities and characters than the stock from which they were derived . Surely the varieties which man presents in his various ethnic forms would suggest that something more has been produced out of the mixture of the elements than was originally brought into association . " She put down her book suddenly , aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of months ago . Though this child , a hybrid , was the first who had presentedhimself to her , surely history was full of them , as men swarmed over the earth and met women of other peoples . Now for the first time it occurred to her , she realized with shame , to think of Christopher in terms of his own potentials . Until now he had been an adjunct of Chris , someone to be fitted somehow into their joint lives , hers and his . What if Chris had unwittingly produced a human being important in his own right ? This idea immediately assumed such proportions in her imagination that she felt a fresh rush of guilt . What if this child were indeed a treasure ? What if he had a mission to fulfill in the future , when she and Chris were old and useless ? If so , what were they doing to prepare the child for that future , Chris having endowed him with the double life of American fatherhood and Asian motherhood ? She saw now that Kim Christopher , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be , even though Chris became the President of the United States ; and this in biological terms as well as human . Her scientific mind , so unnecessary in a woman , she sometimesp218thought these days as she followed Chris from city to city , sprang into action and began regarding Kim Christopher as a new kind of responsibility , exciting but overwhelming . The production of any child was an enormous responsibility , the creation of a new life to be burdened with living out a lifetime in joy and sorrow , but to create Kim Christopher was beyond what she had yet perceived . He was a step into a future of which she and Chris were totally ignorant . Oh , he must not be left to live out his youth in a boy 's school ! " No , indeed , " she said aloud , although she was alone in the library . " No , indeed , Chris , it is not enough to feed him and shelter him and see that he gets an education . Far , far more must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such words to Chris ? Not , certainly , at this moment . There must be no repetition of her July outburst . Election day was only a few days away , now , and all was going well . Chris 's transparent honesty , his single-minded dedication combined with his good looks and resonant voice , enchanted his listeners , as she could very well see . And Joe Berman was beginning to breathe more easily . As yet there had not been the briefest wind of gossip about Kim Christopher . " We 'll make it , " Joe had said the other day as they waited for Chris after one of his great climactic speeches . " I was mortally afraid at first that some skunk would smell out  --  you know what  --  but I guess we 're safe . You got to be careful though . I leave it to you now , Mrs. Winters . " " I ca n't be sure of preventing gossip . I 'm not even sure of people in our own offices . The bills  --  "  | " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , I do take care of all such details myself , but you forget that at the school no one knows the truth , or is in any way on guard . It would be quite natural for someone up there to speak to someone else of a child in whom we have a special interest . " " It must n't happen , " Berman said doggedly . She looked at him , a political boss of the sort that she tried not to despise , and yet a man who , she knew , was utterly devoted to Chris . It was one of Chris 's talents to win the love of men as well as women . She was used now to hearing a woman declare , " he 's the most attractive man I 've ever seen " ; but it was different and more rare to know that a man like Joe Berman , crass and crude and all but dishonest , would and did sacrifice himself for Chris . It was distasteful , too , in an inexplicable way , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " All the same , you know , it must come out someday . There 's no such thing as hiding a secret forever  --  not for a man like Chris . And how can he bear it himself , to wake up every day thinking  --  " " That 's his talent , " Berman broke in , " not to think if he do n't want to . He wakes up in the morning knowing what he has to do that day and he shuts out all the rest . It 's a gift . He do n't agonize . " Joe was right , of course . She was the agonizer , not Chris . So was she , after all , perhaps , the one who would have to solve the problem of Kim Christopher ? Ah , she wished that she had not begun thinking of him just now in thisp220new and urgent way ! He was always there at the threshold of her mind , but she must learn to keep the door shut . As it was , she saw him there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was his own , Kim Christopher was engaged in a private activity . There had been few hours of pure , absorbing play in his life . His place , he had learned in Seoul as one of the " new people , " was always on the fringe of the crowd and in games he had been the spectator , the one pushed aside if he came near the center . Here in this school where he now lived , a place which he had at first thought was an orphanage for boys , until he discovered that parents came to see the other boys and that at vacation time boys went away to return again , he enjoyed to the full the games in which he was encouraged to take part . At first he could not believe he too might  --  nay , must  --  run after a ball , that he , too , could throw and catch . He was quiet by nature and by the habit to which he had been compelled through years of rejection , but now he learned to shout and call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was on the whole accepted by them . In the evening , however , in this hour between sports and dinner , which was his own , he worked with his puppets . Now , the door shut and his roommate , John Barstow , somewhere else with other friends , Kim Christopher drew aside the curtain which hung over a large dry-goods box , and revealed to himself a small stage upon which stood three puppets , which he had carved out of cherry wood . One was his Korean mother . The other two were his fatherp221and his father 's wife , that woman whom he wished to think of as his mother , and yet could not , for reasons he did not know . He took from a cloth a fourth figure , a boy , dressed in American clothes . This figure he was also carving from cherry wood , as he had carved the others . The Korean mother was dressed in Korean garments , the other two in Western dress . The boy 's figure was still far from finished , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tool and went to work , perfecting the head . He could not remember when he first began to love puppets . There were not many puppet shows in Seoul , for people preferred to go to motion pictures and such modern entertainments , but he had known one old man who had been born in Seoul , and who had made puppets and performed with them for forty years and more , or so he said one day when Kim Christopher , pressing close to watch him carve the figure of an old country woman , had asked questions . " Forty years and more , " the old man had mused , " though no one wants to see the plays nowadays , not even the great ancient puppet play , Gogdu Gagsi Noreum . " " I want to see it , " Kim Christopher had said in a firm voice . The old man had pushed his spectacles to his forehead and then had smiled at him . " You shall see it , " he said , " for I am to perform it tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , for it is long and there are many parts to it . " Sooner or later Kim Christopher had seen all the parts of this long play , made up as it is of six different stories ,  |p222with  the result that even while he was in Korea he had begun to dream of making a puppet play of his own . He had neither material nor tools then , and so it had remainedonly a dream . Here , however , he was allowed to carve his figures in art class , and though he had not explained to his teacher the story of his play , for it was only beginning to grow in his own mind , his teacher encouragedhim to carve . His favorite story in the old play in Seoul was when the hero , a lowly man and lonely , Yeongno , makes fun of a nobleman , a yangban . Kim Christopher had no wish to make fun of anyone , and yet he had always felt a sympathy with Yeongno , and thought of himself as such a person , one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he worked with great care and industryupon the figure of himself . He did not as yet know how the story he was weaving about these four characters in his own life would come to an end . Indeed , he saw no end , and therefore could not tell what would happen to this small wooden figure upon which he worked with such absorption . In the midst of it the bell rang for dinner , the door opened and his roommate entered . They did not speak , but John came near and stood at his shoulder . " That 's neat , " he exclaimed . " It looks like you . " " It is me , " Kim Christopher said , offhandedly . " Then who 's those ? " " My father  --  my mother . " " Who 's that ? " " I have two mothers . " " You ca n't have two mothers . Nobody has . " Kim Christopher did not answer . He could not explain.  | " Can they ? " John persisted . " In Korea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife and wrapped the wooden boy in a linen handerchief , laid him down and drew the curtain across the stage . There was a feeling of comfort in making the puppets which he could not explain . But the story troubled him . How could the story end , when it seemed there was no end ? " One thing at a time , " Chris said . They were in his bedroom , he and Laura , she looking very beautiful in a white satin evening gown . White belonged to her , he thought fondly , seeing her in the mirror before which he stood to arrange the bow of his tie . She was slim , her red-gold hair flaming , her slate-gray eyes dark , and she carried herself with a delicate pride , a glamourwhich always reached his heart . And yet he knew that inside the brilliant accidental beauty was another woman , a grave quiet woman , one with simple tastes and a deeply thoughtful mind . He had made the remark in answer to her question , " Do you sometimes think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from stupid Berman had observed , that he did not like to think , not , at least , in the sense that she did . Where she could not help pondering , he postponed thought with impatience , trusting to intuition . All day he put aside decisions , then in the night , before sleep , he faced the decisions that he must make before the next day . He would , as it were , empty his mind and wait for an impulse to appear which felt right to him . It was the one he chose . But he never let an impulse aboutp224Christopher appear , lest it crystallize into premature action . " One thing at a time , " he repeated . The bow was tied to his satisfaction  --  he hated readymadebow ties  --  and he reached for his dinner jacket . " At what point , " Laura persisted , " shall you let the boy 's future be settled ? " She knew she should not ask him , that he was not ready to answer . But her new sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chris about it were too much for her . So now as they prepared for the great dinner , the **28;9765;TOOLONG , she put her question . " I do n't know , " he said . " One does n't decide these whens . I 'll know when the moment comes . Then I 'll see in a flash what I should do . " In a flash it would be , yes , she sighed . She had only hoped the time for the flash might have come . But nothing she could do would hurry it . She knew how his mind worked , and that no decision was ever as sudden or as impulsive as it seemed . Again and again she had seen how a question would thrust itself upon him , as she was sure this one had , and then be pushed aside , but each time he would give it a passing glance of increasing familiarity until , apparently upon the moment , he would decide . He was impatient with her long reasoning approach , he would have no involved logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top of his bent , listening to everyone , picking brains everywhere , accumulating information , letting decision follow . And his conclusions were so nearly always right that she trusted him . So let her trust him now !  |p225She  would see his intuitive gift at work tonight , she was sure . She doubted that he yet had any clear idea of what he would say to the crowd of his supporters and friends , but when he rose to his feet , when he faced them , searching them , he would draw upon them for inspiration , and then , out of the well of his own feeling and knowledge he would give them that for which they waited , that which they drew from him , that which they craved . And he would tell nothing but the truth . It was his genius to seem  --  nay , to be  --  every man 's friend , but when his mind defined conclusion , it would be his own . She knew that he would be a good governor . She believed that someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from her seat at the head table with Chris the brilliant host , she surveyed the flower-laden , overcrowdedballroom . To her right was Henry Allen , looking , she thought , somewhat fatigued . " How will it go ? " she asked . " He has it in the palm of his hand , " the old man replied . " And time , too . I do n't think I could stand anotherday  --  or night  --  of campaigning . Yet nothing seems to tire him . Look at him  --  as fresh as a boy ! He ca n't be stopped . " Could he be stopped ? A whispered word , a question asked at the wrong moment , in the wrong place , and could he be saved ? If only Kim Christopher had been brought out of the shadows , into the light where truth could disarmslander ! She was conscious of an immense inner strain , and she sat quietly , watching the crowd , listening to the bursts of music . Berman , too , was anxious , or so shep226imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet nervouslyquick to notice any commotion at the doors . Tonightif an enemy rose to his feet the whole structure , so carefully built by so many people over these past weeks , could fall into a heap of dust , and millions of dollars could not put it together again . Her imagination , always too quick to conjure disaster , saw Chris downfallen , all his bright spirit gone . How could life go on in such a case ? " You 're very thoughtful tonight , my dear , " Henry Allen said . " Yes , " she said , " an occasion like this makes one thoughtful , does n't it ? So much responsibility  --  " " He can take it . Someone says  --  I do n't remember where I saw it  --  that genius is the infinite capacity to make use of everyone and everything . Our man has it . I do n't mean that in any derogatory sense , either . He simply draws life toward him and he feeds upon it , and is fed upon by others . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread to think what will happen if he does n't win . " She realized on the instant that this was not wholly true . If Chris went back to being a private citizen , Kim Christophercould come home . But how could Chris be an ordinary man when he was never ordinary ? " He will win the governorship , " Henry Allen was sayingwith energy . " Surely you do n't doubt it ? " " Something can always happen . " She longed to tell him what she feared . " Nothing that he ca n't surmount . The people are solidly behind him . He 's made a magnificent job of campaigning . I do n't believe there 's a single county in the state that he has n't visited at least three times . He 's met everyp227issue fully and evaded nothing . The people trust him because they know where he stands . He 's the only man who can stand up against the present governor . " He paused for reflection and then went on . " Do you know , watching him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a creative artist . No , it 's more than a technique . It 's his basic quality . Very modern , too , not at all in the classical tradition ! An artist begins his picture , or a writer his book , without any notion of what he 's going to paint , or write , but the plan grows out of the material he has , and there 's a creation . That 's the way Chris works , with people and with ideas . They 're around , he sees them , understands them , uses them  --  and somehow creates an order where before there was none . " They were interrupted by Berman , who left his seat and came to whisper in Henry Allen 's ear . " Time for you to introduce the candidate , Mr. Allen ! I 've given you ten minutes . " Henry Allen stood up . " I wo n't take that long . " " Take it , take it , " Berman whispered . " Lead up to a big climax . The people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ballroom , people were movingtheir chairs and waiters were hurrying to clear the tables of dishes . The light of twenty-four chandeliers glowed upon the many colors of women 's gowns and jewels , sparkling against the somber black and white of men 's evening clothes . The band was playing softly , and now , as Henry Allen came to the rostrum , it broke into a march , then subsided . In the silence his high , clear voice reached to the far corners of the room . " It is my privilege tonight to tell you the story of a man ,  |p228a  man born in our own community , of a family famous in our state and our city , a man born and educated in the traditions of our people . " It was , she perceived as he went on , a masterly speech . Henry Allen began quietly , his voice literal and unemotional , eminently reasonable and calm . But as he proceeded , he introduced a subtle fire , a pervading power of emotion based upon logic and fact . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his youth , his distinguishedcareer at Harvard and then as a young lawyer in their city . Impeccable , high-minded , brilliant , good friend and good fellow , the character of Chris emerged strong and sympathetic , capable and idealistic , a man able to make dreams come true . " And so I present to you , " Henry Allen concluded , " this honorable man , Christopher Winters . He has served us well here in our city , and now he asks to serve in wider spheres . " He stood aside , and Chris came forward , debonair and confident , modest and proud . Applause rocked the chandeliersand roared through the huge room . He waited , smiling his famous smile , and then began , his voice firm and melodious , his delivery confident and practiced . " My friends  --  " And listening , her heart straining , Laura knew this would be his greatest speech . Far in the night they sat together , a handful of waiting people in Chris 's downtown office , as the votes came in from headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out of five and a half million votes he had won by seventy-five thousand . " Congratulations , Governor ! " Berman 's voice was husky . " Congratulations  --  congratulations  --  " They crowded about him and he smiled at them , half bewildered . He was exhausted , as Laura could see , but triumphant , and he grasped the hands outstretched to him , the hands of people who had stood by him , of people who had worked for him , his office staff , his campaigners . Standing aside , waiting , she allowed them their reward . Then quietly she went to him and kissed his cheek . " You 'll make a great governor , " she said . The moon was veiled , or it had set , she did not know which , or perhaps it was even the dark of the moon , when at last she lay upon her bed in her own bedroom . It seemed long since she had had time to observe the moon , whose light she had always felt conducive to the sort of mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflective thinking . Lying in this very bed , before or after love , or in those pauses when Chris was too employed to think of love , she had gazed often on the moon as it hung outside the wide window which faced her bed . Tonight , after the excitement of victory , Chris had suddenly yielded to exhaustion . None could have guessed , and for once she herself was deceived by the heartiness of his manner , his joyousness properly combined with a decent modesty , as he received congratulations . Reporters had descended when his victory was confirmed , and from them at lastp230Chris had laughingly , apologetically , extricated himself , crying , " Tomorrow , fellows  --  no , I do n't really know how I feel about it . I 'll have to find out  --  " and so saying , had led her by the arm and they had escaped and come home . Then , the door once closed and locked , he had crumpled and she caught him before he fell . " No , no , " he protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not beaten , but beat . " They had come upstairs , and she had laid out his night things while he showered , and then she had seen him to bed and the windows opened , and by then he was already asleep . So she had left him , sunk in slumber , and had closed the door between their rooms , so that no movement of hers could disturb him . For she was sleepless . Now that the race was won , what would they do with victory ? She bathed in leisurely fashion , she brushed her hair , she went to bed at last and lay in the unlit darkness and rememberedwhat Henry Allen had said , that Chris was an artist , and worked as an artist works , with his material and from it , waiting for its own shape to take form . She must wait , too , leave things as they were  --  yes , wait if need be until after Christmas . When Chris was with Kim Christopher , when the three of them were together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , know what he must do , what they must do , for her life was his . With this thought , peace fell upon her and in its quiet she slept . " He has adjusted very well , " Dr. Bartlett said . They were waiting in the school sitting room for Kimp231Christopher to appear . Christmas holidays had begun the day before . Most of the boys were gone and the building was quiet . Outside the snow was falling in windless silence , great drifting flakes of white against the winter gray . " He is probably working with his puppets , " Dr. Bartlett said . " Puppets ? " Laura inquired . " He is quite talented , " Dr. Bartlett said . " I wish he could be equally diligent in all subjects , but we must not ask too much . He has learned a great deal in a few months . " " Do the boys like him ? " Chris asked . " The ones whom he likes do like him very much . The others seem to  --  respect him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by the way at all  --  his English is excellent . He 's good in languages . And he has a fine singing voice . The music master has put him in the choir . He seems to enjoy that . " " What about sports ? " Chris asked . " He 's not for heavy sports like football . He 'll take to tennis , I should think , and he does well enough in baseball . He is lacking in a sense of competition , which is rather a handicap , since we use games to develop the competitive spirit so essential in our society . He enjoys doing something well without seeming to care if he wins . " They were interrupted here by the entrance of Kim Christopher  --  " Or , " as Laura had said , on the way here today , " let 's just call him Christopher , without the Kim . Do n't you think it 's time ? "  | " As you say , " Chris had replied absently . He was drivingand they had talked very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy . Let it be seen first what he had become , they had seemed to agree . They saw at once that he had become another than the boy they left . Even Laura saw that , although she had seen him since Chris had . He came to the open door and stood there an instant . He was taller , much taller , that they saw . He wore a dark blue suit with long trousers , and this added to his height and to his age . He was clearly more than a few months older . That they saw . What made him really older was a new gravity , not quite sadness , a perceptive acceptance , perhaps , that no longer allowed for the ready smile , the lighting eye of childhood . They did not speak to him , Dr. Bartlett with intent , for he wanted the boy to make his own approach to the two who somehow belonged to him and to whom he belonged , a relationship which the headmaster thought he understoodbut still found puzzling . The boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it as easily now as he had when he first came . Nor did he write to the man as often as he had in the beginning . Indeed , checking with the master of his dormitory , he learned that the boy had written no letters for many weeks and had received only postcards . Nothing had yet been explained . Laura did not speak . She had made up her mind on the long , almost silent , journey today that Chris must make the direct approach . Son and father must solve the problemof their relationship . She could only be a bystander . She sat quietly now in her chair , gloves in hand , her minkp233jacket across her knees , and waited , allowing herself no more than a welcoming smile . Christopher looked at her uncertainly , smiled briefly , and then fixed his grave eyes upon his father 's face . He had been expecting them all day , since no one knew when they would arrive , and all day he had not left his room except for meals . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been carving his new puppet , a small boy with a round face and Korean features . The wood was hard , as was the material of the other puppets , and since it was his last piece he had carved slowly and with care . Once his knife had slipped and cut his thumb . He had bandaged it himself with a strip of white cloth . Chris looked at the headmaster and then at Laura , as though he expected them to speak . Then , seeing them silent , he spoke with a gruff heartiness . " Hello , Christopher . Come in , boy ! " He held out his hand and Christopher came in . They shook hands , and Chris did not let the boy 's hand go for an instant . " You 've grown tall , " he said . " Every day I eat meat , " Christopher explained . He withdrew his hand gently and sat down on a chair at the other side of the room . There he was silent , but easily , as though he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soonya 's admonishment that he was never to speak first to his father , but remain silent unless he were asked a question , and then he must speak clearly and with as few words as possible , waiting for his father to proceed . " That 's good , " Chris said . " A growing boy should eat meat every day , eh , Dr. Bartlett ? "  | " We think so , " the headmaster said , smiling . It was now his turn and he spoke kindly to his pupil , and quite without condescension . " I 've just told your father and Mrs. Winters that you have shown remarkable talent in carving wood sculptures . You might like to take them to your room and show them what you have done . " Christopher 's pale face flooded with pink . " I am not very good as I wish , " he said . " It makes me shame for showing them now . I have not done such work before . " " We would like to see them , " Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will let you have dinner with us at the inn . We 'll bring him back early , Dr. Bartlett . " " Of course , " the headmaster said . He rose , relieved . " I 'll leave you to yourselves , then , Mrs. Winters . We like the boys to be in the dormitory by ten o'clock , but since it 's holiday time , we sha n't be too strict . " " We 'll have him back before ten , " Chris said . " I 'm weary , myself . " " You put on a great campaign . I congratulate you on your victory . " Chris smiled . " Trouble 's just beginning , I daresay . I have messes to clear up in our city and promises to keep . " " You will do both , I am sure , " Dr. Bartlett said gracefully , and withdrew . Chris rose . " Come along , Boy ! Let 's see what you are doing . Lead the way for us . " They followed him , and he walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Asian grace , for it was her rememberedimpression that all Koreans walked with thatp235smooth step , each foot exactly placed . His head was well set , the dark straight hair lying neatly to the skull , and yet the shape of the body was American , Western , strong , the frame not slight , the bones well articulated , the hands not small . She had an opportunity to see those hands at work a few minutes later when they were in Christopher 's room , for he drew aside a curtain from a box that stood upended in one corner of the room . There revealed was a miniature family sitting room , a comfortable room designed , as she saw , after the room they had just left , with a settee , chairs , and round tables . In the chairs sat two figures , a man and a woman , the man reading a book , the woman sewing . She recognized them as resembling herself and Chris . " Christopher , " she exclaimed , " how clever they are ! See , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took the figure in her hands . It stood perhaps seven inches high , and every detail was clear , the wide-set eyes , the smooth hair , real hair , she saw , glued on hair by hair , and the garments exact and neatly made . " Good work , " Chris said . He had a strange feeling , not quite comfortable , of recognizing himself in this puppet . The boy did not answer . He accepted the praise without a smile , and when they had seen everything , exclaiming over this and that , he drew the curtain again . " So this is where you live and sleep , " Laura said , looking about the room . " Here is my half , there is John 's , " Christopher said . " The two halves are quite different , " she went on . " I can tell the difference between you . " Two aspects of one room , and yet there was no mistak/ing which side was Christopher 's . On one side there were pennants and pinups , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other , the walls were bare except for a stark small drawing of a mountain rising above clouds . " Yours ? " she asked , and Christopher nodded . She turned to Chris . " We have an artist . " " Most boys are artists for a while , " he retorted . " I used to draw ships , and my mother was all excited about them . " Something cool crept into the atmosphere and Laura dispelled it promptly . " Let 's have dinner , " she said . " I 'm hungry . " " Well , what do you think ? " she asked the next morning in their hotel bedroom as she dressed . " Too quiet , " Chris said . She turned on him with indignation . " Of course he 's quiet ! He does n't know what will happen to him . " Chris , still in his pajamas , stretched himself on one of the two beds . " Do we know ? " She corrected him . " Do you know ? It 's for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll follow faithfully , but I will not decide . " " What would you do , imagining you were in my place ? " " I ca n't imagine it , " she said , so promptly that he laughed . " I should n't have left myself open for that ! Do n't think I 'm not puzzling , Laura . Do n't think I 'm immune to the fact that the boy 's my son , either . But the arguments still hold . Maybe when I 've proved myself a great governor ,  |p237maybe  then we can introduce him gradually into our lives . After all , the times are loosening up . Plenty of half-Americankids over there and people are beginning to know it . But just at this moment , when I have n't stabilized my public image , it would be suicide . Timing is everything . Give me time . " " The boy is growing up very fast , Chris . He 's thinking and feeling . His soul is crystallizing . Some day soon it may be too late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We may not be able to reach him if we wait too long . He 'll reject us , because he 'll know we 've rejected him . " " Oh , come now , Laura , these are old , worn-out words . Psychiatrists have taken all the gloss off them long ago . He has to realize that he 's in circumstances that may be peculiar  --  atleast unusual  --  but he has to accept them . He 'll have to explain over and over again in his lifetime who he is , even to himself . He 's born , he exists , he 's different . The sooner he accepts himself , the better for him . Even if he came into our home today , he would not be the child we might have had together , you and I. " " No , but we could help him accept himself by accepting him ourselves . " " Have you decided already what should be done , in spite of saying that you wo n't make the decision ? " She retreated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might say , on the other hand , that it would be simpler for him if he did not have to explain us , and therefore he 's better off alone . " " He 's not alone . "  | " Yes , he is , in all essentials . " " No more than every one is , basically . " " Not at his age , and from a far country . " " We 'd better send him back , you 're saying  --  decision again ! " " We ca n't send him back . Even if we sent him back physically , he would not be the same boy . Part of him is now here . He knows you are his father . He 'd be strange in Korea . He always was , because people there did n't want him , but now he knows it . He did n't before . The rope has been cut , Chris . He 's out in the middle of the ocean , looking for the shore . " Chris leaped from the bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ? " It was not difficult . The day was brilliantly clear and cold , the air windless , the snow perfect . They breakfasted and then found Christopher , waiting and ready , in the entrance to the main building , skis in hand . He had a look of cautious excitement , the air of a child who had known disappointment , and in the midst of hope was also ready for despair . But he was handsome , she thought , his eyes the dark violet blue that was so strange a mixture , his olive skin smooth and clear against the red of an old parka . He would have his problems with women someday , that was to be foretold , and could the chance of his birth keep him from a woman whom he might love ? Foolish to let her mind leap ahead of the years ! " You like to ski , Boy ? " Chris asked . Laura had a peculiarfeeling that the word " son " was very close , and her heart leaped for a second ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or perhaps forever ?  | " I like , " Christopher answered , " but not most . " " What do you like most ? " Laura asked . They were out to the car now , settling skis upon the rack . Then they got in , Christopher alone in the back seat . " So what do you like most ? " Laura repeated . He considered carefully . This human being , she thought , would never answer any question quickly . There was a deep caution in him , a disbelief in life . " I like best singing , " he said at last . " Sing to us , " she said . " We 've never heard you . We did n't even know you could sing . " He considered a moment , then without comment he lifted his head and sang a Korean song . They listened , exchanging looks . This was no ordinary singing , a music as clear as a flute , the voice still unchanged , a high soprano but not thin . There was power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can this boy be wasted ? But she remained silent and when he had finished she said " Thank you , " and since Chris was silent , too , she was about to say " Let 's get on with the skiing , " when suddenly he spoke . " Let 's hear an American song , Boy . " Without hesitation Christopher began again to sing . " Oh , beautiful for spacious skies  --  " He sang the entire song , Chris driving straight ahead as he listened , his eyes fixed on the road and the snowcoveredmountains beyond . When the voice ceased he did not speak for a moment . Then he said , " I like that one , Boy . I 'm glad you know that one . " Neither speech nor song for the next ten miles , until they came to the mountain and to the ski slopes , and then there was no time for anything except the preparation forp240the sport , the strapping on of skis , the seating in the ski lift and rising up over the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crest of the mountain . " You ski between us , Boy , " Chris said , " and Laura goes first . I 'll follow so that I can pick up pieces , if necessary . " He was very busy checking straps and equipment , obviouslynervous about the boy and , not knowing his skills , ready with advice . " Sure you know how to turn ? Watch Laura  --  yes , call her Laura  --  I give my permission and you may call me Chris if you like . We 're all friends , are n't we ? So , here we go ! " They were off , and she dared not turn her head until they were at the foot of the first steep slope . Then , slowing , she looked behind her up at the mountain . Christopher was making a slalom , cautiously resolute and with perfect form , and farther up the mountain Chris was gathering speed . They met at the foot of the mountain , their cheeks red with cold and their eyes bright with warmth . Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll make a famous skier , Boy ! " he shouted . " Thank you , Father , " Christopher replied . Their eyes met , Chris amused and somewhat embarrassed , the boy unsmiling . " All right , " Chris said . It was impossible not to yield to Christmas . They had bought nothing for themselves or for Christopher , Christmasuntil now an unreality in the shadow of immensities of decisions and resolutions . Now these faded away in thep241brilliant snow-lit sunshine of one bright day after another , and Christmas itself came near . " The boy needs better skis , " Chris declared one morningwhile they were dressing . " I 'll get them for his Christmas , and I 'll show him how to take care of them . " " And I shall buy him a new parka , " Laura said . " The one he 's wearing is something left behind by an old boy . It 's all right , but it 's not his . And he needs better carving tools . I saw a set from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner . " Once they began to prepare for Christmas there was no stopping the rising flood of enjoyment , as old as tradition itself . Chris had long been cynical , declaring that cities and merchants had made a commercial circus of the whole day . Here , however , in the simplicities of the small clusters of houses and shops of a mountain village , there was no false glitter . Christmas trees were cut by fathers and sons and decorated by the family , and Chris , to Laura 's amazement , declared on the morning of Christmas Eve that he and Christopher must ascend the low hill behind the school and choose an appropriate tree . The three of them would decorate it , and Laura must find the ornaments . While they were gone she searched for the unusual , and liking a tree sparely trimmed she brought back her choices and waited for the return . In an hour they returned , " my men , " as she called them in her thoughts , and Chris put the tree into a frame he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornaments . Christopher had never seen a Christmastree , but as he sat cross-legged on the floor watching her , he reached for the silver and gold paper in which thep242ornaments had been wrapped , and began to fashion them into the shapes of butterflies and birds . " Lovely , " Laura said . " Let 's hang them on the tree , too . " And Chris , lounging now in a comfortable smoking jacket , watched the two of them , thinking , thinking , his mind playing upon possibilities . Possibilities , not all impossibilities ! Now Laura could see this in his eyes , could feel it in his smile . Perhaps , she thought , for the first time a resolution of their problem loomed in the near distance . Once Christmas was over , once he was home again , perhaps he 'd be ready to let the decisive impulse appear . Well , this was Christmas time , and while he always proclaimed that he had no sentimentalities , he was obviouslyallowing himself to be amused by Christmas in a village as like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the fir trees that stood outside the houses , snow fell freshly on Christmas Eve , was falling at this very moment while Christopher and Laura trimmed the tree which he had set up in a corner of the sitting room of their suite here in the small , clean hotel . It was the boy 's first Christmas , and he watched Christopher while Laura told him the Christmas story . " It is the birthday of a great and good man , so good that he called himself , and was called by other people , the Son of God . " Christopher listened carefully , sitting cross-legged near the tree , now shining with pointed lights . " What is God ? " he asked . " Have they not told you here at school ? " Laura asked  | " I hear the name , " he said . " The Name is all we know , " Laura said . " No one has seen his face . We can only talk of him and believe that he exists because the worlds exist and somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Son was born on Earth  --  " She told the old story , and Christopher listened with increasing intensity . " And so the Son had nowhere to lay his head , " she finished softly . Christopher sighed , he clasped his arms and rocked himself back and forth . " Sometimes I , too , had nowhere to lay the head . Sometimes my grandmother was angry to me , and I must run away and at night put my head on the street to sleep . " She met Chris 's eyes with eloquent inquiry . Can we return him to that ? The day had proceeded to evening and they were busy with wrapping gifts , each in turn putting his gifts beneath the tree . Every move was new to Christopher and exciting . His face had lost its habitual look of gravity . His eyes sparkled , those eyes which looked black and were blue . He forgot to be dignified and he laughed and poured out questions . " Like this ? Like this ? " He was wrapping a small box . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the card on with the name of the person it 's for . " " It 's for you , " Christopher cried , laughing . " It is forp244you only ! You will like very much . Shall I show you now ? " " No , no , not until tomorrow morning . Then everyone will open the gifts . It 'll be fun . " With these words Christopher was taken by a sudden ecstasy . Chris felt the boy 's arms clasp him about his waist . He looked down into the changed face , vivid now with feeling . " I am liking you too much , my father ! " " It ca n't be too much , Boy , " he said and put his arm about the firm young shoulders . Then he released himself gently . It could be too much . If he decided to leave the boy here it could indeed be too much . " It 's time we all went to bed , " he said . " Nearly midnight  --  goodheavens ! " It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really be too much , next morning after the breakfasthad been sent up to their rooms and been eaten , the Christmas tree blazing away . Breakfast over , the gifts were to be opened and exclaimed upon . In his own pile Chris found a carved box , small but exquisite , that Christopher had made . " For me , first , " he said frankly , " for putting stamps in , but I wish to give you . " " I need just such a box for my collar buttons , " Chris said . But Christopher was already absorbed in a joy of his own , his new skis . " For me ? " he asked . " Only for me ? "  |p245Assured  , he was compelled to put on new boots and strap on the skis and time passed , and when the church bells rang for morning service not all the gifts were opened and they must hurry , for Christopher sang in the choir . Out into the fresh snow again they went , wrapped against the keen morning wind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks down the street , now gay with people , and filed into the church among the crowd . Christopherleft them then and tiptoed into the vestry , and there among the other boys from the village and school he donned his white robe and marched into the choir loft . Then he searched the congregation until he found the two to whom he somehow belonged , though in what way he did not know , and he continued to watch them until the moment came , just before the sermon , when he had his solo to sing . Now he rose , stepped forward to the edge of the loft , and his hands clasped behind his back , he began to sing as he had never sung before . " What child is this  --  " His voice soared into the groined ceiling and Laura , sitting hand in hand with Chris , released herself , and openingher bag she felt for her handkerchief . Chris , hearing a soft sob , turned his head to look at her , and met her eyes , wet with tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child indeed  --  what child is this ? " He made no answer . " Do you want to talk with Henry Allen ? " Laura asked . Christmas was over and they were home again but sheknew that Chris was very far away , wandering somewherep246in a country of his own . They had not talked beyond the needs of daily living , not for the four days since they returned . He had been busy at his office , preparatory to moving into the Capitol buildings , and she too was preparing for the move . This house , which was their true home and would always be , would be left exactly as it was , with Greta to be the caretaker . Weekends and holidays they would come home , but the work week must be elsewhere , beginning next week . For years it had been their habit to give a great party for all their friends , this on New Year 's Eve , and tomorrow was the next to their last day . Chris did not reply . They were alone , a rare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ henceforth . The wood fire was burning in the chimneypiece here in their own sitting room upstairs , and she sat in her rose-red velvet chair , Chris opposite her , in his blue smokingjacket . When he did not answer she went on with her needlepoint , an ancient work which she had begun years before and now picked up of an evening without intent or even much hope of ever finishing , but it gave her hands something to do when she could not read , if she were alone with Chris . When still he did not reply she spoke again , " I know you are troubling your mind over something and I can guess it 's about Christopher . Right ? " " Right . " " So if you do n't want to talk with me  --  and I can understand that because you think I 'm biased in his favor  --  then why not Henry Allen ? " " I make my own decisions , " Chris said.  |p247She  was silent for a moment , putting her needle in and out with a resolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him , pushed away , set aside , and that strange foolish jealousy hovered once again in the offing of her spirit . Was he with Soonya ? Were Soonya , Christopher and he together now in his thoughts ? She sighed and folded her work . " I think I 'll go to bed . I feel weary tonight . " " You 're not ill ? " " No . Perhaps I need to get back to my own work . " " That work of yours  --  it 's your escape . " " Maybe . We all need an escape , do n't we , Chris ? " Her voice was cool , she meant it to be so , and he felt the coolness and caught her hand as she passed . " Do n't be cross with me , sweet ! " " Of course not . Only  --  I 'm so long in the dark . " " I have to do this my own way . " " You 've always done things your own way , have n't you , Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She had the impulse to withdraw her hand , being so very far away , but she did not . Instead she sat down on the footstool by his chair . " I do want it , usually , " she said . " Have n't I always wanted you to be free ? But where this child is concerned , somehow I feel I have a right to know what is going on in your mind . In a sense , he 's my child now , too . He has no mother but me . When I took him away from  --  from Soonya  --  which I could never have done , Chris , if I 'd thought she loved him or ever could love him  --  no , truly , Ip248could n't have  --  I assumed the responsibility of being his mother  --  another sort of mother , of course , a woman who only took the place of someone else , but someone he 'd really never had . So yes , in a sense I do feel you owe it to me at least to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes shining like hard sunlight upon her face upturned to his . But he shook his head . " Sorry , " he said shortly . " I still ca n't . I 've got to decide on what it means to me , one way or the other . I do n't know which way , but I 'm plugging along , step by step , toward some end or other . It 's my career , my life . " " Henry Allen  --  " she interrupted . " Not Henry Allen 's , ' he retorted . She gazed up into those blue eyes and saw herself reflectedvery small in the black pupils . " Does it occur to you that if you decide one way I may  --  despise you ? " " So be it , " he said grimly . She rose and kissed him lightly on the forehead and went to her own room . There she stood , hesitant for a moment . Then she went to the door between their rooms , standing open as it usually did , and she closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she unlocked it , but left it closed . Two nights later and the house was filled with the noise and laughter of their party . The swaying music of a dance band drifted through the open rooms . She had chosen to decorate the rooms in smart modern flower arrangements , and guests in clusters were admiring what she had done.  |p249She  enjoyed such decorative effects and planning them with a florist had occupied her surface mind while she waited , for what she did not know . There had been no letter from Christopher  --  Kim Christopher , she was beginning to call him again in her thoughts , for a reason only intuitive or perhaps only defensive , perparing herself for Chris if he decided " How do you do , Laura , " Mrs. Allen said . She turned to greet them both , Mr. and Mrs. Henry Allen , Mrs. Allen in her usual black taffeta , and he in the dinner jacket he had had made in London years ago , which stretched across his now expanding front in concentricwrinkles . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , pressing Laura 's hand . " But everything is even more splendid than usual . I sha n't like not coming to this party next year . " " Ah , but you will come , " she said impetuously . " We shall have it every year as usual , forever ! " They smiled and went on and she turned to other guests , other couples , gathering thickly now in the three great rooms . In the dining room , waiters were standing ready to serve at the loaded buffet tables , in the drawing room people were already dancing , here in the library she and Chris  --  where was Chris ? A moment ago he had been in the room and coming , she supposed , to stand at her side . Now he was gone . She turned her head this way and that . No , he was not to be seen . Ah , he must be with Berman in his study . 0 Chris , ca n't you forget business for a mo/ment ? she muttered between her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not , the guests were coming too fast . " Where 's Chris ? " " I do n't see Mr. Winters . " Again and again she parried . " He 's here somewhere . I 'll find him in a moment . " Then suddenly he was there again . He entered from the hall , looking very confident and strong , his cheeks red as though he had been outdoors . He came to her side at once . " Chris , where have you been ? " " You 'll know later . " There was no time for more between them . The eveningcaught them into its whirl . " A wonderful party , you do everything well , " he told her fondly as they danced . Then someone cut in and she did not see him again except here and there , now dancing , now talking , now playing the host with his usual ease . All the guests were here , two hundred perhaps , she guessed , almost as many as they had invited . She glanced at the clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new year ! It was always a solemn moment , this midnight of the passing year , but never as solemn as upon this night . The new year  --  what did it hold ? The old question posed itself and she slipped into the small conservatory for a moment alone . There was more in this year to come than the new life for Chris as governor , more for her than being his wife and the first lady . This year would answer her question about Chris . Whatever he did she would love him , but was that lovep251quite enough ? Either for him or for her ? What . if there were that certain loss which she so dreaded ? What if he did not rise to the full height she set for him ? And wrong of me , she thought , because when I set a height of my own for him , I make a decision for him which I have no right to make . Suddenly there was a stir at the door leading into the hall . The band stopped playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Not yet midnight  --  and usually the dance always went on at a quickening pace until the hour struck and the music broke into Auld Lang Syne . " My friends ! " Chris was standing at the open door from the hall and his voice rang through the rooms . She came out from behind the greenery but she did not enter the crowded rooms . She had never seen him look like this , not even when he made his acceptance speech as the new governor . " I speak to you as my friends , " he was saying . " I speak to you , too , as men and women who have supported me in my ambition to be the governor of our state . I will not , indeed , I could not , hide from you what it means to me to have reached this point . Yes , I 'm ambitious ! Yes , I have my dreams ! I shall continue to dream . I want to be a good governor . I want to serve you and all our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to share with you a part of my life of which you have known nothing . " She knew instantly what he was about to do , and she listened , her breath tight in her throat , tears streaming down her cheeks , her heart beating its drums . She listenedp252while he painted in powerful strokes the description of young men far from home , lost in wars they did not understand , fighting battles with enemies human and inhuman . " These are our men , " he said . " They are our sons and brothers . They are living and dying today in seven countriesof Asia ! They are very young , pitifully young . They grew up in homes like yours and mine  --  kindly , warm , safe homes . Today they feel utterly alone . How do I know ? Because I was one of them once , long ago , in a country called Korea . " He paused and pressed his lips together and went on . " Our young men find what comfort they can , wherever they can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . They clutch at life with both hands , for they never know what hour they must die . I was one of them . They gather in dance halls . There is no other place to gather . They meet girls . They buy what love they can find . Yes , they know it is a pitiful , tawdry kind of love , but it is usually all that is to be had . They live in the shadow of impending death and they seek refuge in the arms of a girl  --  a stranger , but a woman . I was one of those young men , but luckier than most , for what I found , though temporary , was not tawdry . But the story does not end there . If it did it would not be worth telling . Again and again it does not end there . From that brief union , which so often ends in tomorrow 's death , some times there comes a life . It is the life of a child . In those seven countries of Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thesep253children are being born . What significance have they ? This  --  they are the new people , children of the future , born too soon , before the world is ready for them . No one is ready for them , no country , no man , no woman . They are born stateless . Do the fathers know ? Sometimes they do , sometimes they do not . What they do n't know is that in Asia the child belongs to the father . I was one of those who did not know  --  until such a child was born to me . Now I know . " He paused in a long silence , an endless silence , she thought . He was gazing high over their heads , his jaw set . She knew the pulse that was beating in that firm jaw . The room was utterly silent  --  not a movement , nor a cough , not a whisper . Now he turned and put out his hand , and she saw him draw Christopher into the room . They stood side by side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the father , and the father smiled down at the son . Impossible not to see the resemblance  --  the same eyes , the saute mouth , the same profile ! " Christopher , " Chris said , " these are our friends . I want you to know them and I want them to know you because you are home now to stay . I want them to know me , too . That 's why I tell them about you . " The boy did not move . He continued to look up at his father . Chris was speaking to the people again , this time gaily as though he were suddenly released . " Friends , this is my son  --  our son , for my wife is with me in all this . She went to Korea and brought our boy back with her , our son Christopher . He has a beautiful voice . I want him to sing for you . Sing , Christopher ! "  |p254Christo|pher  stepped forward then , one step in front of his father , and lifting his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thee  --  " 0 Chris , Laura was crying softly to herself , 0 Chris , who but you  --  who but youShe must get control quickly now , for as soon as the song was ended , she must be there beside them . But she was not quick enough . Before she reached them old Mr. and Mrs. Allen swept forward , arm in arm . " Welcome , Christopher , " Mrs. Allen said in her loud imperial voice . " We 're glad you 've come home . " " Welcome , my boy , " Mr. Allen said and seizing Christopher'stwo hands in his he shook them both at the same time . Then he turned to Chris . " Congratulations , Winters , a fine son  --  very fine boy  --  glad you found him  --  glad about  --  everything ! " The crowd waited , doubtful , then surged forward to follow the old pair who had always been their leaders . And Laura , running through the hall , took her place beside Chris . In the midst of handshaking , curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whisper . " What next , Chris , my love ? " He gave her his one-sided smile . " Who knows ? " " Anyway , " she whispered , " there are three of us now . " " So far , so good , " he said . " So far , so good , " she echoed , and behind his back she reached for Christopher 's right hand . As the clock began to strike that magic hour the voices of their friends around them rose in song . Over the sing/ing could be heard the clear bell-toned voice of their child Christopher  --  " Should auld acquaintance be forgot . . . " Never , she thought , never forgotten ! But Soonya , Mr. Choe , Korea , were all a part of the past , and this was a new year.
