( See Cover ) <P> Battling Nelson did it ! Battered , bloodied , beaten , taunted , hooted and laughed at during bitter , frustrating months , Republican Nelson Rockefeller never gave up , never stopped swinging . And last week he flattened five rivals in Oregon 's presidential primary . The count : Rockefeller 92,142 , Henry Cabot Lodge Jr . 77,334 , Barry Goldwater 49,197 , Richard Nixon 47,078 , Margaret Chase Smith 8,142 , William Scranton 4,456 . <P> Rocky 's smashing upset may not appreciably have changed his chances for this year 's Republican nomination . By any reasonable rating , he would still stand behind Goldwater , Nixon , and perhaps Scranton . <P> But his Oregon triumph was far from meaningless . It gave him increased momentum in his desperate effort to overhaul his only opponent , Goldwater , in California 's June 2 primary . It showed once again that if the Republicans nominate Goldwater they will be picking a proven poor vote getter . It all but kayoed Lodge . The big argument in Lodge 's favor was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't , not by a long shot . Rockefeller 's win also fractured the notion that Nixon can get the nomination simply by making a few phone calls . <P> The Reason Why . Less specifically , but perhaps more importantly , Rockefeller 's victory infused drama and excitement into what had become a dull , dreary Republican race . It showed that there is still plenty of life in the Grand Old Party . To those Republicans who think there is no chance of beating Democrat Lyndon Johnson this year , Rocky demonstrated that " where there 's life , there 's hope " is more an axiom than a maxim . Above all , Rockefeller 's Oregon win increased what has been called the " scatteration " of strength in the Republican presidential picture . And in so doing , it greatly increased the possibility that the so-called Republican kingmakers-the amalgam of corporation executives , party professionals and publishers-who have so far been mere spectators at ringside , may yet find it necessary to get in and referee the bout . <P> Oregon 's outcome was obvious from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes after the polls closed , NBC-TV declared Rocky the winner . From there on , it was mostly a matter of pollsters and pundits trying to figure out how they had gone so wrong . One commentator , referring to the supposed political effects of Rocky 's divorce and remarriage , lamely concluded that the results might be related to the fact that Oregon 's divorce rate is among the highest in the nation . <P> But there was little excuse for such devious reasoning . For once , a political post-mortem could produce a clear , simple explanation . The reason Rocky won was that of the six contestants in Oregon he alone was there-working , fighting , pleading his case , and showing Oregon that he really cared about the state , its primary and its 18 delegates . And where were the other Republican runners ? <P> Where They Were . Henry Cabot Lodge , the odds-on favorite in Oregon , was still in Saigon , presiding over U.S. efforts to win the war there , consulting with visiting Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and General Maxwell Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Saigon Sports Club , and staying as silent as any Buddhist idol about his political plans .
