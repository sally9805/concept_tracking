 | Four Years After the Kennedy Assassination : Could It Happen Again ? Four years after Dallas . . . could it happen again ? Why were the security - measures taken to protect the late President Kennedy not effective , and at has been done since to guard Presit Johnson ? Could another President without warning before a sniper 's 9 On the fourth anniversary of the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy , . Secret Service has a new , more extensive ? and efficient ? look . And Congress seems eager to continue giving the Service the wherewithal to fulfill its primary reason for being ? to protect the esident of the United States . The number of Secret Service agents is roughly doubled ( to about 650 ) , as is the annual budget ( to about $17 million ) . The Secret Service 's protective intelligence files on persons in various cities judged to be potential threats to the President have been computerized . Data that would normally take a week to compile are printed out electronically in less than five minutes . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees that what happened in Dallas could n't happen again ? not that way , at least . President Kennedy and his Vice President , Lyndon B. Johnson , were riding in open cars , in a slow motorcade , on Nov. 22 , 1963 . Mr. Kennedy was an easy target for Lee Harvey Oswald or any other disturbed or deranged individual who had some competence with a rifle . President Johnson has n't ridden in an open car in public since that day . Mr. Johnson has since used the same Lincoln Continental Mr. Kennedy occupied in Dallas . But not before the Ford Motor Co. ( which leases the car to the government at a nominal rate of $500 a year ) rebuilt it to make it bulletproof . Assisting in the rebuilding , done to Secret Service specifications , was Hess and Eisenhardt of Cincinnati , a custom-body firm that participated in the construction of the car in 1961 . The detachable plastic " bubble top " that was part of the car 's equipment before the assassination was not bulletproof . Yet some officials feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a chance of deflection of the bullets from Oswald 's high-powered rifle . In any case , the car now is heavily armored and has a bubble top of clear , bulletproof glass . A detachable black-vinyl cover for the bubble top provides the privacy of a  | limousine , shielding occupants from view . In addition to the armor plating ? much of it along the bottom and underside of the car to guard against a booby trap or grenade ? the rebuilding job included a new high-performance V-8 Lincoln engine , and new heavy-duty transmission , suspension , steering , brakes , axles , and tires . The president also uses a leased Cadillac limousine sedan that is armored . The Secret Service is extremely sensitive about disclosing details of the President 's cars . A Guam newspaper reporter recently learned just how sensitive the President 's bodyguards are when Mr. Johnson was on the island last March for the Vietnam summit conference . When the reporter got close to the bubbletop Lincoln and began taking notes , was quickly pulled away , warned . his notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was quickly pulled away , warned , and his notes confiscated . The nondetachable bubble top is not the only change to lesson chances of another Oswald getting at a President . The greatest improvement at the Secret Service is its protective research operation -- now a vastly more sophisticated intelligence-gathering and evaluation system employing modern techniques in science , electronics , even psychiatry . The interst of the Secret Service now goes beyond obvious cranks and mental cases , and extends to political extremists of every stripe -- subversives , ultra-rightists , racists , adn fascist -- whose statemetns or actions have suggested tendencies toward violence . roof screens like ass shield , set up e the White House tie 1965 inaugural panave been used on  --  ber of occasions to t the President and party .

The nthly flow of items of intelligence on tential troublemakers has grown from t a few hundred a month in 1963 to 100 to 7,000 . The Service 's " trip file , " containing names of those deemed to be serious rents , and thoroughly checked whener a presidential trip is planned , has own from about 100 to about 1,800 . It es n't necessarily mean that more people have become threats . It could reflect a more efficient intelligence method of spotting persons who should have been considered threats all along . The computer stores this information geographically . Say the President is planning a visit to Akron . In a few moments , the computer can spew out a report on persons in the Akron-Cleveland area who might be of concern to the Secret Service in connection with a presidential visit . Had the present protective research system been in effect in 1963 , Oswald st certainly would have been flushed fore President Kennedy ever left Washton for Texas .

All of this , and much more , was known to the government ; none of it was known to the Secret Service . One is incredulous in retrospect , as was the Warren Commission , on realizing that while the FBI , CIA , State Department , and Office of Naval Intelligence all had files on Oswald , the Secret Service had nothing ? not a solitary word . While Oswald , under today 's rules , would be a marked man ? certainly warning bells would sound ? what of persons less clearly marked ? While no one is foolish enough to offer guarantees , the present system worked , on just a few hours notice , on Feb. 23 , 1966 , when Mr. Johnson addressed a Freedom House banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York . When Mr. Johnson was interrupted by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace in Vietnam , " the heckler was hustled away by two tablemates . It was no coincidence that the two tablemates were Secret Service agents . The Service had received the 1,500-name guest list at four that afternoon . A quick check with the New York City police Special Squad brought word that the man was a potential troublemaker . Tighter coordination with local police is one of the major recommendations of the Warren Commission on Secret Service procedures , recommendations now being carried out . The cooperation of local and state authorities is essential when the President is traveling . Another major recommendation concerned the checking of buildings along Continued on page 194  | a motorcade route .

For obvious reasons , sec. can be the most effective weapon of in guarding a President . A number trips since the assassination were not nounced until the President was practi ly en route or until he landed . But in a democratic society , the Pr dent , as the Warren commission observed " must go to the people . Exposure of President to public view through tra among the people of this country i great and historic tradition of Amer : life . " Given that condition , the job of 1 ' tecting the President will forever involved an element of chance , a degree of r : As former Treasury Secretary Dour Dillon , who headed a presidential comission supervising the Secret Service organization , told Congress : " There is a certain physical danger come what may . This is inherent in ing President . " The element of chance was clew. present at the Glassboro , N.J. , sum : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several thousands had waited for hours through blistering heat and downpour ? a glimpse of the two leaders . The front rank of the crowd , confined by a fen and a line of state troopers , was no more than 20 to 30 yards from the crest of t. sloping lawn . The crowd could not see the Presider and Kosygin emerge through the doe The Secret Service no doubt would ha ' preferred that the two climb into ca @#  | and drive off immediately . Kosygin , in fact , began to enter his car after he and the President shook hands . But Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin made little-noticed move ? to gratify the crowd and increased the security risk .

The more danger passed , the kind of momen can never be entirely eliminated ever a President travels . The Secret Service does n't have reminded of this as a presidential paign year approaches , a time in Mr. Johnson will feel compelled t to the people " more often . Such can not be kept secret . And national litical passions run deep over such issues as the Vietnam war and riots in the city . From a security standpoint , the campaign will be a sensitive time . The Service has plugged important gaps , but gaps will inevitably rent Since 1865 , the Warren Report na four Presidents have been assassins ( Lincoln , Garfield , McKinley , Kennedy and attempts have been made on life of a President ( Truman ) , a President-elect ( Franklin D .. Roosevelt a presidential candidate ( Theodore Roosevelt ) .
