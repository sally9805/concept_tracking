txt The House passed the Administration 's 81.3 billion school-aid bill tonight after more than eight hours of argument that split Democrats and Republicans into two hostile camps . The vote was 263 to 153. voting for the bill were 228 Democrats and 35 Republicans . Voting against were 57 Democrats and 96 Republicans . Republicans bitterly protested what they called " the White House steamroller " that sent the school bill through the House virtually untouched despite nearly 20 attempts to change it . It marked the biggest victory so far this year for President Johnson . No legislation granting broad aid for the nation 's elementary and secondary schools has ever passed the Congress . The bill now goes to the Senate , where committee hearings on similar legislation have been completed . Passed Both Before A broad program of general aid to education passed both the Senate and House in 1960 but was killed in the House Rules Committee , which refused to send the House measure to conference to iron out the differences in the bills . The Senate in 1961 again passed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clearly on the church-state issue . Seeking to avoid the churchstate issue this year , President Johnson sent Congress a program of aid keyed largely to impoverished children . Administration forces trounced all but one effort to change the bill . That one change , a minor one , calls for limiting membership on an educational advisory council . " I want to go home in a blaze of glory and I accept your amendment , " Representative Adam Clayton Powell , Manhattan Democrat , who was floor manager of the bill , told startled Republicans , who by that time had lost hope for any change . Working far into the night , the Democratic . leadership succeeded in turning back proposals for judicial review and for sending the bill back to committee . . The judicial review proposal , offered by Representative Howard W. Smith , Democrat of Virginia , won strong supPort from Republicans and Southern Democrats . Mr. Smith suggested , tongue in cheek , that " this bill has been treated like it has been Sent down from heaven . " Leading the opposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. , He argued that state court tests could be made under existing law and that these could eventually be reviewed by the Supreme Court . The Republicans , outnumbered 140 to 294 by the Democrats , grew increasingly bitter as the day progressed . Learning that the Democrats hoped for a final vote by 4 P.M. , they successfully blocked action . hy a series of maneuvers  --  demanding quorum calls , asking that the lengthy House journal of the previous day be read in full and demanding teller votes ' in which members must pass . one by one up the aisle to be counted . Under the bill , the bulk of the money , $1,066,000,000. would go to schools in poor Sections throughout the nation . The Federal funds would all go to public schools . However , special services and arrangements  --  such as shared-time classes , counseling and mobile units  --  would be provided for students in parochial and other private schools . Other features of the bill would be supplemental education centers open to adults and youths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and private ' schools . The title to such books and materials would remain with the public agency . In three days of tense debate , Republicans and a scattering of Democrats had charged that Administration forces were trying to carry , water on both shoulders -- trying to please those on both sides of the church-state issue . The decision to use these maneuvers was explained by Representative Gerald R. Ford Jr . of Michigan , the minority leader who had unseated the previous Republican leader , Charles A. Halleck of Indiana , earlier this , year on a platform pledging " aI new image " for the Republican party . His party , Mr. Ford told the House , was trying to dramatize the Democratic action in shutting off debate on the school- , aid bill . The Democrats , Mr. Ford said , were being unfair to the Republicans and to the American people . The Republicans , he said , had tried to be cooperative , but the Democrats had turned Ithem down . This drew a quiet protest from the majority leader , Carl Albert of Oklahoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image ' ! emerged . all I 've heard of is ' ! the cooperative effort on the ' other side . . . When is the co- ; operation of the ' new image ' ! , going to start ? " Democrats hopped to their . feet and gave Mr. Albert a ' cheering ovation that lasted for ; nearly a minute . Joining the Republicans in ; denouncing Democratic tactics ! . was Representative Edith Green , Democrat of Oregon , generally ' regarded as one of the more , ! liberal members of the House . ' I airs . Green had sought the , ' day before to amend the bill , ; but had been defeated . Tonight , ' ' she voted for the bill . " I have been a Democrat all my life , " she told the House today . " One reason I have been proud of being a Democrat is because we have tried to protect the minority . I have never ' interpreted this as just protecting an ethnic minority . " 1 Mrs. Green accused several ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican minority . She received a standing with Democrats reluctantly joining in . Representative Richard Bolling , Democrat of Missouri , had his hands full as temporary presiding officer , and he steered the House through parliamentary maneuvers and shouting exchanges across the floor . At one point , the exchange of words became so bitter that , Republicans asked that Rep : Frank Thompson Jr. , Democrat : of New Jersey , be censured by I Speaker John W. McCormack . The move came after Mr. Thompson had risen to reply to ! church-state criticism raised by ; Representative John B. Ander- , ! son Republican of Illinois , " I might suggest , " Mr.1 ! Thompson said , " that you can ! I beat this dog all you want for ' political purposes , you can demagogue however suddenly land try to scare the people off at the expense of the nation 's ; school children with your ; demagoguery . " Speaker McCormack held that members should " have a certain flexibility in the expression ( I of their views ' ' and he refused ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
