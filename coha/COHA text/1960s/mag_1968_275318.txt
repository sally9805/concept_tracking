As the son of a multimillionaire , Robert F. Kennedy grew up to know the lush green lawns of Palm Beach , the snowy slopes of Vermont , the blue skies and waters of Hyannisport . He reached manhood with the barest notion of what life is like in the slums , and with scant concern for the hollow-eyed and hungry who people them . <P> Nevertheless , when he was assassinated last June in Los Angeles , Bobby Kennedy was the idol of the poor and the deprived , worshiped by blacks , Mexican-Americans and Indians . Cynics were never able to reconcile this devotion . They believed that Kennedy exploited the poor for selfish political purposes . In fact , R.F.K. did many things for political reasons , and his initial interest in the poor may have been in part politically motivated . <P> Yet no one who knew him doubted the depth and sincerity of his devotion to the people of the " other America " when he found them . He never talked more movingly than when he described the poor . " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would ask friends . " Up to a certain age , they are so much freer and less inhibited than the faces of well-to-do children . They sense what they are up against . " <P> Unmet Needs . Bob Kennedy had scarcely begun his fight to change the condition of the poor . Last week his widow , sisters and surviving brother established a memorial that they hope will accomplish some of what he sought to do . On the sloping back lawn of the Robert Kennedy home in McLean , Va. , the family announced its plan for a Robert F. Kennedy memorial foundation . " We hope to form several task-force groups , " said Edward Kennedy , " and to enlist the young . It is a most appropriate memorial-a living memorial - to carry on his concern , compassion and interest in the unmet needs of our country . " <P> The Senator 's parents will be honorary chairmen of the project , and former R.F.K. Aide Fred Dutton will direct its operations . Dutton said the memorial will begin with such programs as luring college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is the sort of thing , " said Ted Kennedy , " that he would have been doing . " <P> The immediate task is to begin raising the $10 million that will be necessary to establish the programs . It remains a question , of course , how effective any such crusade , however passionately intended , can be . Ted Kennedy himself is likely to encounter criticism that the effort is political . Yet the memorial could well serve to help dissipate the miseries of the poor . If it does , it will be true to the finest side of Robert Kennedy .
