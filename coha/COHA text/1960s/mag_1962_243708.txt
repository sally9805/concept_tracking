In deference to teetotaling Mormon George Romney , his aides stuck strictly to sherbet punch during Michigan 's Republican convention . But by convention 's end , they could probably have used a real drink . Heckled by opposition within his own party , Romney had lost his temper and slashed out at Democrats in a fashion that was likely to haunt him . <P> Unhanded . The trouble began just a couple of nights before the Republicans met in Detroit to welcome Romney as the G.O.P. 's candidate for Governor and nominate the rest of his slate . Into the Statler Hilton walked a well-tailored man named Edward Kelly , 37 . From an unsuspecting night clerk he wangled Room 1020 , just two doors down the hall from Romney 's headquarters . As it turned out , Kelly is state coordinator of Michigan 's John Birch Society-and Candidate Romney has publicly promised to purge his party of its Birchers . <P> Romney and his followers were furious when Kelly hung a Birch sign outside his door and began peddling the Birch Society 's Blue Book at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At one point , someone tried to tear down Kelly 's sign . <P> There was a scuffle , and Kelly played it for all he was worth . Cried he to one of the tusslers : " Unhand me , sir . " Romney 's men tried to persuade the management to toss Kelly out-or at least to transfer him to another room , preferably in the basement . But Kelly would not budge . <P> At first , Romney himself tried to stay above the battle . Then , at a 2:30 a.m . <P> meeting with newsmen , he switched the subject to Democratic extremism . Said he : " Their extremist group is the Communist Party elements . Their problem is in the form of Communism , not in the form of Birchism . That has been historically true . In the last 30 to 35 years , they the Communists have worked themselves into positions of importance not only in Government , but into the ranks of the party . I think that Communism is still a problem in the Democratic Party . " Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Communists ? Romney hedged : " It 's difficult to say . . . " Appalled . Democrats , holding their own convention in Grand Rapids , made the most of Romney 's outburst . Incumbent Governor John Swainson found it " incredible . " Lieutenant Governor T. John Lesinski pronounced himself " shocked and appalled . " The convention roared through a resolution labeling Romney a " political slanderer . " There was no recourse but for beleaguered George Romney to issue a " clarification . " He had never said that " there are Communists at the present time inside the Democratic Party . " He did " not believe that the Democratic Party would knowingly harbor a Communist within the party . " He simply thought that both parties " must be constantly on the alert " against infiltration from either the right or the left .
