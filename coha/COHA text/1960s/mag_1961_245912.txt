The Happiest Girl in the World has <P> several Broadway marriage brokers-Librettists Fred Saidy and Henry Myers , Lyricist E. Y. Harburg-trying to unite Aristophanes and Offenbach . Unaware or uninterested that the two are mismated , the matchmakers give their efforts much more sense of ravishment than of matrimony . For plot they have gone to Lysistrata , with its inspired , antiwar idea of having wives lock their bedroom doors to make their husbands lay down their arms . But in production terms that idea has recurrently inspired more bad taste and ponderous bawdry than it was ever worth , and if The Happiest Girl is no more than middling lewd , it is so clangingly loud and heavy as to suggest marriage with the Anvil Chorus . Moreover , the lavish librettists have added Greek deities to Greek dames , offering scenes on an Olympus that , culturally , seems way below sea level . Furthermore , all the characters favor a modern idiom , so that when not dittying " Whoever is chaste has got to be chased , " they talk of sponsors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population explosions . Against all this , the evening offers Jan ice Rule as a Diana down in Athens from Olympus , Cyril Ritchard as a Pluto up from Hades , attractive William and Jean Eckart sets . The musical also has at least one good Dania Krupska ballet , and some of Offenbach 's best and best-known tunes . <P> Miss Rule is attractive as both dame and deity ; Ritchard is resourceful at several kinds of deviltry ; and when the two dance together , there are moments of charm . But even the better shenanigans get skittish or noisy , and the Offenbach delights are dulled by weak voices or smart-alecky words . Musically , The Happiest Girl in the World is much like re-encountering a bewitching Paris charmer on the sands , and in the spirit , of Coney Island . Squeezed between all that is heavy-handed in the show and all that is tawdry , what has merit is left gasping for air .
