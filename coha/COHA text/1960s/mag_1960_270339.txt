For very different reasons , the two names that may lastingly identify the 1959-60 TV season are Charles Van Doren and David Susskind . With his now-famed , melodramatic confession ( " I was deeply involved in a deception " ) . Van Doren exposed not only the quiz fakes but the underlying shoddiness of the TV industry , started an ostentatious if temporary move toward purity . Susskind , who emerged again as the season 's most prolific producer , demonstrated that the most important problem- more important than quizzes , payola and canned laughter-is good programing . <P> Susskind has had a hand in close to 100 shows-not all good by any means , but at least suggesting effort-including New Jersey-WNTA 's excellent Play of the Week and the weekly Susskind symposium . Open End . He also produced miscellaneous specials ( notably NBC 's Moon and Sixpence with Laurence Olivier ) , the CBS Du Pont Show of the Month , and helped turn out a series of NBC dramatic programs that established Art Carney , once known only as Jackie Gleason 's second banana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susskind influence had its drawbacks : too many of his shows were $200,000 reproductions of old movies , books and plays , further threatening TV 's almost lost hope of becoming a source of original drama . <P> Midas Touch . For the rest , it was the season of the unspectacular spectaculars . There were about 400 shows advertised as " specials " amid loud fanfare . With some notable exceptions-such as Leland Hayward 's superbly imaginative The Fabulous Fifties on CBS-most of them fizzled , by the standards of taste as well as ratings . The two major dramatic shows , CBS Playhouse 90 and NBC Sunday Showcase , are being crossed off the schedule for next season , as well as the muchballyhooed $15 million NBC Ford Star-time , which did some good drama ( e.g. , Ingrid Bergman in The Turn of the Screw , Alec Guinness in The Wicked Scheme of Jebal Deekes ) , but otherwise ran up an awesome string of flops . Many of the less ambitious series fared no better . A total of 55 shows will not return to the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masterson , from Desilu Playhouse to the John Gunther show . The only new series in 1959-60 that really clicked in the ratings was Dennis the Menace , based on Hank Ketcham 's comic strip about a sort of Public Enemy No . . <P> Next season the familiar Midas-touch system will be in force more firmly than ever-oaters , private eyes and twice the number of situation comedies . A new one on ABC threatened to be the ultimate development in its field : an animated-cartoon series called Flintstone , about a family living in the Stone Age . <P> Equally incredible is a new NBC series called The Barbarians , about a Celtic prince named Ravic ( Jack Palance ) who lived 2,100 years ago , but was able to get around with modern speed : in the first one-hour episode alone he is captured by the Carthaginians , made a galley slave , sees his beloved sister commit suicide to avoid dishonor , leads a revolt , is recaptured and sentenced to be crucified , is saved by a voluptuous Carthaginian princess , escapes in a trireme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
