Come Blow Your Horn ( by Neil Simon ) seems the best of the season 's many bad farce comedies . It must be grouped with the bad ones because it writes most of its scenes in duplicate , smudging some of them to boot ; makes most of its jokes in triplicate , and should never make half of them at all ; and seems to confuse the typewriter bell with a cash register 's . But Come Blow Your Horn does squat head and shoulders above a number of recumbent rivals : beyond a lively production , it manages to keep going ; it has some fresh and funny lines and some diverting scenes and characters . <P> The play tells , of a successful , school-of-hard-knocks Jewish manufacturer whose older son ( Hal March ) has turned playboy and whose younger son leaves home for his brother 's bachelor apartment and way of life . Come Blow Your Horn alternates-and often combines-wolf calls with phone calls ; it offers Pop 's indignant sermons , sarcasms and ultimatums , Mom 's discombobulated personality and absorption with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Warren Berlinger cornily amusing as little brother suddenly outdoing big one . But the play 's three acts are like having much the same thing for breakfast , lunch and dinner ; and there is one of those final 30 seconds in which Playboy embraces both work and wedlock and Pop embraces Playboy . Playwright Simon will be more worth thinking about when he spurns a last-minute eraser and uses a blue pencil throughout .
