THE MIRACLE AHEAD by George Gallup . 205 pages . Harper &; Row . $3.95 . <P> <P> George Gallup is haunted by a pollstergeist . He is possessed by the notion that if enough people are polled on enough subjects , the truth about disease , happiness , longevity , poverty , politics and war will soon become obvious . Then , armed with facts , the population need only use its untapped brain power to usher in " a higher plane of civilization " that would make classical Greece or the Renaissance look like cultural wastelands by comparison . " All that is required , " Gallup asserts with Panglossian optimism , " is a firm belief in man 's great potentialities and a readiness to accept change . " <P> Gallup 's prediction of victory through brain power derives from scientists ' estimate that the average Western man uses only 2% to 5% of his mental capacity . Gallup argues that exercising the intellect with weighty issues will toughen flabby thinking , nourish creativity , enlarge perception . Yet Gallup 's own thinking is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simply a plea for mental uplift with very little to support it . <P> The assumption that increase in knowledge will enable society to better manage its affairs is not borne out by history . Gallup praises individualism but concludes that supersecret group thinking , such as the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bomb , is the intellectual wave of the future . As for the roseate vision that mental muscle building will enable man to " solve any problem that comes within his purview , " even Gallup occasionally sobers up . " After a time , " he concedes , " human beings run out of ideas . "
