txt The Santa Barbara oil-spillage situation may have a far wider consequence than the damage now being done and the efforts to prevent reoccurrences . It has raised in the minds of a number of congressmen and conservation leaders the possibility of reexamining the entire system of granting oil drilling leases on chiefly economic factors  --  with little regard for basic environmental values . A subcommittee of the Senate 's Public Works Committee heard a panel of conservationists pose questions  --  still unanswered  --  as to the potential dangers from offshore oil activity to fish , wildlife , and the microorganisms which are basic to the entire food cycle and ecology of an area . Louis S. Clapper , representing the National Wildlife Federation , suggested that " federal , state , or local governments should establish policies of refusing to permit offshore oil operations which pose a threat . to outstanding public recreational beaches and // *Offshore drilling probe widens // other facilities , at least until a greater need for these oil resources is demonstrated .

Unfinished business Senator Muskie ( D ) of Maine had called the hearings to take up unfinished business from the last Congress , when amendments . to the Water Quality Improvement Act failed at the last moment , after being passed by both Houses . Thermal pollution and oil spillage from tankers ( such as the Torrey Canyon disaster ) were to be the main subjects for these hearings on antipollution legislation now- before Congress . But the Santa Barbara incident became the chief topic of discussion . Lloyd Tupling , representing the Sierra Club , said the club 's Santa Barbara chapter had opposed allowing drilling when the issue had first come up . But no public hearings were allowed before the leases were negotiated last year by the Department of the Interior . Rupert Cutler of the Wilderness Society said his organization would like to see the Sarfta Barbara Channel become one of the first units within a proposed National Marine Sanctuary System , a type of marine wilderness system .

But the Interior Department had said there was absolutely no chance of accident due to the advanced drilling technology . Stronger casings used Fred Hartley , president of Union Oil Company , whose drilling operation was the site of the " blowout " which has spread oil on Santa Barbara beaches and surrounding waters and islands , said that stronger casings dropped to a lower depth would prevent a reoccurrence of the accident . Many conservationists , however , believe that drilling should be halted until it can be definitely determined that drilling of oil over a known geologic fault area does not present dangers from earth tremors . The conservationists were also bothered by Mr. Hartley 's opinion that the actual damage was being elevated out of proportion . As of the night previous to his testimony , Mr. Hartley said that only 163 birds had been known to be affected by the spreading oil , and 100 of those birds were still alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do our best to save our feathered friends , " Mr. Hartley said . " But I do say to you that relative to the number of deaths that have occurred in this fair city ( Washington , D.C. ) due to crime and .. . relative to the problems of our nation , this desecration to the offshore area of Santa Barbara , although important and certainly one which we are fully devoted to taking care of , relatively it does seem that we should give this thing a little perspective . This is a problem which , although it has been referred to as a dis- aster , is not a disaster to people . There is no one being killed . " Also discussed in the committee hearings was the problem of liability for damages due to oil spillage from drilling or from ships .

But drilling resumed the next day after engineers of the Interior Department , state and companies agreed it would be safe . Friday morning . Mr. Hickel ordered a ban on further drilling " until Union 's ruptured well can be sealed and until the required geological knowledge is secured . "
