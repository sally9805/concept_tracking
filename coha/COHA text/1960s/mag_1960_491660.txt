( Continued from Page 27 ) of both parties . This article takes a closer look at Kennedy as a man and a candidate as he approaches the crucial tests of the spring primaries . In the ' 56 Democratic convention the young senator from Massachusetts had two pieces of luck . These were that he ( 1 ) almost , but ( 21 not quite , captured the nomination for the vice presidency , The dramatic closeness of the race made Kennedy 's attractive personality known to millions . And the fact that he lost out saved him from sharing the blame for Stevenson 's crushing defeat the following November . It was then that Kennedy , who had strongly supported Adlai Stevenson in ' 52 and ' 56 , began to feel that he himself had a chance to win his party 's nomination in ' 60 . But he could do it . he figured , only if he started earlier and worked harder titan the rest of the field . Thus began , in whatever intervals he could spare from his senatorial duties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pace was sped last fall by a gift from his two brothers and four sisters . These generous siblings , a close-knit and well-heeled clan , chipped in to provide brother Jack with a private airplanealt is a two-engine job , fitted out " executive style " with desk and sleeping quarters . This gives candidate Kennedy a margin of mobility over his Democratic rivals , at least for the time being . As the campaign gets hotter , I think chartered planes will become a commonplace . The gift plane also serves notice on other contenders of a saying well known in Massachusetts : " When you run against Jack , you are n't running against just one Kennedy , but the whole tribe . " His two brothers are already working hard for him . They arc Bob Kennedy , nationally known for his work as counsel for the McClellan committee investigating racketeering in the labor-management field ; and the youngest brother , Ted , a husky ex-footballer and recent graduate of the University of Virginia Law School , A young brother-in-law , Stephen Smith , is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heats up , I predict that the sisters will join in . They , too , have the Kennedy energy , charm and political zest . While the plane extends Kennedy 's range and speed , it is not an unmixed blessing . Its vacant seals invite hitchhiking reporters and politicos who , during the flights which might be devoted to rest , ply the candidate with questions and adv ices . Through most of the day the kaleidoscope of faces and scenery changes so fast that there is no time for boredom . It is during the long evening banquets that ennui creeps in , heavy as the postprandial cigar smoke . Then comes the polite but cruel custom of introducing , one by one , " our many distinguished guests . " They in turn may respond with " just a few words . " There is the lieutenant governor , perhaps , the local congressman , the mayor , members of the legislature and the city council  --  and so on along the line to " that wise physician , who has held his honored office longer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Through many such rituals I have watched Jack Kennedy intently . If he is bored , he shows no trace of it . I do n't think he is . His active mind and acute perceptions are at work . He is picking up local color and references for his own remarks later on , He is sensing the mood of the crowd . He is appraising and remembering each of the persons introduced . For these are people who , if they are not delegates themselves , will help choose the delegates for the National Convention in July . The slow-motion introductory proceedings serve also as an effective contrast to the force , humor and brevity of Kennedy 's own speaking style . He evidently subscribes to the old preacher 's doctrine that " few souls are saved after the first twenty minutes . " Usually his talks run for a quarter of an hour or less . He has a typewritten text at hand , but he seldom looks at it or tries to follow it . He shortens , interpolates or embellishes to fit the temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , with no holds barred . When the dinner is over , the audience surges forward , and again there is the handshaking and autograph signing . It is getting late now , but there is still the visit to the club or the labor temple or the Grange , " where some of the boys want to get better acquainted with you . " Then at last , long after midnight . back to the hotel or motel for a few hours ' sleep before the early-morning dash to the airport . There is a certain thrill in watching any performer who " makes the hard ones look easy . " Kennedy moves through the grind and rush of the day with a casual , jaunty air ; he never seems in a hurry , and his high-spirited combination of earnestness and good humor seems as fresh at night as in the early morning . We landed one evening at the airport near Superior , Wisconsin . It had been an unusually trying day . Bad weather had messed up the flying schedule , thinned the outdoor crowds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time I saw in him any signs of strain , evidenced mainly by the clenching and unclenching of his hands . Fifty minutes later , after a fast drive , he was under the studio lights in Duluth , Minnesota . It was a " live " TV panel show  --  in Senator Humphrey 's home territory . Kennedy 's friends watched uneasily as he faced the questions of four political reporters . But now the signs of strain had vanished . Kennedy , fielding the questions with his customary aplomb , looked as fresh as a daisy  --  the calmest man on the show . Apparently he is able to tap new reserves of energy as needed . is this the power of will or the instinctive reaction of a fiercely competitive spirit ? Probably some of both . Anyone familiar with his war record and his subsequent years of struggle to overcome his combat injuries knows there is a strong vein of the Spartan in his character . And all the Kennedy boys are , by inheritance and training , as competitive as race horses . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have its perils , but three years of it has given Kennedy a superb training in the hard art of political campaigning . Back in 1946 , when he first ran for Congress in Massachusetts , friends say Kennedy was so shy that they practically had to push him onto the platform . Now he is a practiced professional who has blazed his own political trails through the nation  --  including Alaska and Hawaii . He is so at home in a crowd that he can throw away the rulebook and play it by car . He is not a polished speaker , nor an orator in the old flamboyant style which made the eagle scream . He tends to talk a little fast , throwing new facts and ideas at his audience more quickly than they can be absorbed . He avoids theatrical effects and gestures . His voice is strong , with a touch of Boston and Harvard in the accent . His English is clean and vigorous , and he speaks the language of scholarship and the vernacular with equal facility . He has developed , whether among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city auditorium , the faculty of sensing the mood of his audience . The value of this was shown during the autumn at the Al Smith Memorial Dinner in New York . An annual function for the benefit of charity , it draws together 2500 of the leading citizens from New York and the nearby states . Influential politicians of both parties were there in strength , keyed up at the prospect of comparing the merits of the two chief speakers , Gov . Nelson A. Rockefeller and Senator Kennedy . ( This , of course , was before Governor Rockefeller announced his " definite and final " decision not to run . ) It was a glittering and full-dress affair . But among the metropolitan elite at the Waldorf-Astoria , even as in Siwash Corners , there is a tendency for the dinner to be a bit too hearty , the preliminaries too extensive . By the time the principal speeches were reached , the eminent assemblage was showing traces of torpor . Rockefeller , who spoke first , seemed not to detect this creeping lethargy . He stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solemn side . He read it manfully , but the applause was only polite . Now it was Kennedy 's turn . He too had a prepared speech , but his seasoning on the hustings had taught him that something more lighthearted now was needed . He mixed his serious remarks with banter and gave even the religious issue a surprise twist when he said , " We all recall what happened to a great governor when he became a presidential nominee . Despite his fine record as governor , despite his plain-spoken views , his campaign was a debacle . . . . He lost states which his party had held for half a century and , to top it off , he lost his own state which he had served so well , You all know his name and his religion . It was Alfred . " Here Kennedy paused . The audience nodded understandingly , thinking of Alfred E. Smith . " . . . it was Alfred M. Landon , Protestant , " said Kennedy . The crowd , after a moment 's surprised hesitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he continued blandly , " I see no reason to suggest to Governor Rockefeller that the Republicans should not nominate a Protestant in 1960 . " He went on to kid the traditional coyness of candidates , including himself , about announcing their presidential ambitions . He recalled At Smith 's remark that any governor of New York was usually to be found " sitting on the steps of the capitol at Albany with his spyglass trained on Washington . " He added , " I do n't know whether Governor Rockefeller is looking toward Washington or New Hampshire ( where the first primary will be held March eighth ) . . but the last time I was in Washington I did notice a rather worried figure sitting on the steps of that Capitol with his spyglass trained on Albany . " During his talk , which lasted only nine minutes , he was interrupted ten times by laughter and applause . In November , when all candidates were still declining to announoe . Kennedy did not hesitate to turn his wit on himself A questioner in Wichita , Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a favorite candidate for President " I do have a favorite candidate , " replied Kennedy , " but until he has the guts to declare he 's a candidate , I 'm not going to announce , s1 him .

" Thus lightly he dismiss , ordeal which had affected elesen of his Isle . It is worth summarizing here for the light it throws on Kennedy 's character as a man It began on a stades .. night in 19.0 when I reutenant Kennedy 's PT boat was patrolling the waters off the northern Solomon Islands . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It slashed the frail PT boat in half , flung most of its men into the sea and ignited the fuel which gushed from its tanks .

The morning light showed their situation to be still desperate . The three islands %Oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese forces . Three miles to the southeast Kennedy could see a tiny island which he hoped was uninhabited . As the wreckage settled lower in the water . Kennedy made his decision . " We 'll swim to that island , " he said . " There 's less chance of making it than to the others , but there 's also less chance of Japs . " Nine of the men hung onto and pushed a long two-by-six timber . The tenth was too badly burned to swim . Kennedy took the strap of the man 's life jacket between his teeth and towed him . It was five hours before they reached the little island and crawled exhausted up its beach . When darkness came Kennedy swam far out into Ferguson Passage . hoping to signal an American boat . None came through . As he tried to swim back to his island the current became too strong for him . He lapsed into a state of semiconsciousness and delirium . The trick currents carried him all the way around the Jap-occupied island of Gizo . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this time he was able to make it back to his friends . They were still without food , and thirst was becoming a torture . That afternoon Kennedy decided they must move again , to another small island to the southeast where he could see coconut trees . They went as before . nine paddling the timber and Kennedy towing the burned man . This swim took three hours . They found some coconuts to eat . During the night there was a shower , and they were able to lick some water  --  mixed with bird droppings  --  from the palm leas  --  es . On the fifth day Kennedy . after exploring another island , Nauru . encountered two natnes with a canoe . They spoke no 11107. t ? 1,111 seemed ri silly , With his ' 10.1 a message j. , ?

On the seventh night an Amelican PT boat crept in to the title island and iescued Kennedy ten men . At Rendova the haggard S. s were welcomed back like men Born the dead Lieutenant Kennedy was decorated with the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for heroism and leadership , but for him the ordeal had just begun . His spinal injury was more serious than he had realized . He was shipped back to the States for long hospitalization . Naval surgeons performed a disc operation which was only pal ? successful . For elesen years the s , trouble recurrently pained and ... tippled him . For a time he would seem as active as ever : then he would be confined to his bed or base to hobble on crutches . By 1954 the pain had become so frequent and intense that Kennedy  --  then in the Senate  --  decided to undergo a dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned him that the risks were too great , but Kennedy decided to go ahead with it . He entered the New York Hospital for Special Surgery in October of 1954 . It turned out that three operations were necessary . Twice he was so near death that his family was called to the hospital . His convalescence took sesen months . By the fall of 1955 he was restored to the vigorous health he has enjoyed since . So ended the long trial by ordeal which began when , as Kennedy remarked , " My boat was sunk . " During the months of his convalescence he wrote the book Profiles in Courage . It tells the stories of eight American statesmen who risked or ruined their political careers by holding to their convictions in the face of party pressure and popular clamor . They were John Quincy Adams , Daniel Webster , 1 homas Hart Benton , Sam Houston , Edmund G. Ross , Lucius Lamar . George Norris and Robert A. Taft . The book hit the best-seller lists and won a Pulitzer Prize . To date it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical work dealing mainly with questions of political duty and honor , ( . greater interest to one consid .

Al Harvard be had specialized in government and foreign affairs , graduating rum hustle . and planning a career as a writer . While he was in college his father , Joseph P. Kennedy , was the American ambassador to England . On visits to his father Jack met many of the ! Iowa ) leaders , including Chamberlain and C hurchtII . He became a student of England 's politics , focusing on the curiously slow response by Britain to the fast-growing threat of Hitler 's Nazi Germany . Year by year he followed parliamentary debates , budgets and military appropriations . In 1940 Jack Kennedy made this the subject of his senior thesis . Friends urged him to expand it into a book , which he did . It was received with critical acclaim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such painstaking scholarship , such mature understanding and fair-mindedness , such penetrating and timely conclusions that it is a notable textbook for our times . " The Herald Tribune described it as " This electrifying diagnosis . . . . an extraordinarily able achievement . " Recently rereading Why England Slept I was struck by its relevancy for today . It is a case study of the problems of a great democracy faced by a totalitarian dictatorship . The democracy is peace loving , comp1.1 , - ent , attached to its comforts : the . ' ? ? rship , with a lower standard of is hard-driven , centrally directed , ruthless in decision . The analogies to America 's position vis-a-vis Russia , while not exact , are close enough to be alarming . With the background of such studies , Kennedy has naturally been especially concerned with our comparative sluggishness in the face of growing Soviet skill and power . In the Senate he has worked and voted for measures to revitalize our education , science and research . Militarily he urges more intensive efforts not only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting " brush fire " wars . Our burdensome farm surpluses , he believes , could become a blessing if wisely used to feed the hungry peoples of the world . As a member of the Senate Labor and Public 71 Welfare Committee , Kennedy is working now on legislation to give the President greater powers to settle strikes  --  such as that in steel  --  which put a drag on the whole national economy . As a candidate , Kennedy can use humor effectively . Hut when he gets down to the substance of his speeches , he preaches a hard gospel . In politics this is unusual , if not unpalatable . American voters arc used to being told that they are the salt of the earth and there 's a good time coming . Kennedy 's message is quite different . He does not flatter or talk down . It is interesting to watch his audiences . When he tells them there 's a tough time ahead and the sooner they face it the better , when he says that they and all of us must prepare for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of puzzled uneasiness . As he goes on , the impact of his facts and figures . of his earnestness and vitality , is clearly felt . At the end there is often an instant of tense silence , then a rising ovation . It is not that Kennedy has " changed " these people . But most of us have , beneath our outer optimism , a troubled feeling that we have failed to live up to the greatness of our heritage . It is this chord which Kennedy strikes and brings to life . His example gives force to his precepts . Born to wealth , he could have chosen a life of ease . Instead , from college days onward  --  whether as athlete , scholar , writer , PT-boat skipper . public servant or candidate  --  he has driven himself close to the tolerances of human endurance . In part , it ? ense energy and drive is an inborn in part , it derives by inheritance ulna training from his remarkable family . His forebears came over to Boston from Ireland during the great potato famine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pick-and-shovel level . First by sweat and muscle , then by brains and character , they worked their way up into politics and business . Kennedy 's maternal grandfather was John F. Fitzgerald , who served three terms in Congress and several years as mayor of Boston . He was affectionately known as " Honey Fitz " because of his sweet singing soice and his blithe , beguiling ways . From him no doubt come some of his grandson 's personal charm and political flair . Kennedy 's father , Joseph P .. was a noted athlete at Harvard . During summer vacations he operated sight-seeing buses and managed to save 55000 by the time he was graduated . With this as capital he went on to accumulate one of the great American fortunes , In politics he was an early supporter of Franklin Roosevelt . During the New Deal days he served as chairman of the new Securities and Exchange Commission , then of the Maritime Commission , before going to London as ambassador .

A bomber pilot , he had already completed his full quota of combat missions . He stayed on to volunteer for a special and extra-hazardous mission  --  a strike against the German missile bases . He was killed in the explosion of his plane . When Jack decided to run for Congress in 1946 , it was in some sense with the feeling that he was carrying on for his brother Joe . He was a diffident candidate at first , but soon warmed to the spirit of the contest . He won in ' 46 and again in ' 48 and ' 50 . His hardest fight was in ' 52 vs hen he defeated Henry Cabot Lodge for the Senate by 69,000 votes , while Eisenhower was sweeping the state by almost 210,000 . In 1958 he was re-elected by the greatest majority in the history of Massachusetts . He carried every city and county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heartened by his return to vigorous health in 1955 and surprised by his unexpected showing in the convention of ' 56 , Kennedy raised his sights toward the presidency . Some advisers urged him to play it slowly , quietly cultivating the support of the party leaders . This did not appeal to him logically or temperamentally . He felt that he had certain political handicaps which could be overcome only by a fast start and a bold campaign to appeal to the voters themselves and to the lesser politicians who form the bulk of convention delegates . He was unwilling to wave his fate to the top leaders . They . especially the older men , are inclined to caution , wary of " controversial " candidates . They would worry about Kennedy 's youthful appearance and his religion . As Kennedy once said , " If the nominee is picked in a smoke-filled room , I 'd be the last man out . " Kennedy will be forty-three in May . Vice President Nixon , the Republican front runner , is only forty-seven . But Kennedy looks considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vivid impression of youthfulness . The impression is heightened when he is accompanied by his strikingly beautiful wife , the former Jacqueline Lee Bouvier . This highly educated and intelligent young lady , who is twenty-nine and the mother of a two-year-old daughter , looks more like nineteen . She seldom speaks at political meetings , but in French-speaking sections of New England and Louisiana she enchants her hearers with a graceful greeting in that language . She speaks it so fluently that her husband sometimes adds , " 1 assure you that my wife can also speak English . " The accent on youth cuts two ways . If it troubles the older voters , it appeals to the younger . In each state I visited with Kennedy I was impressed by the number of youthful volunteers working ardently for his cause . Some seers insist that Americans require a " father image " as President : if so , Kennedy will have to wait another eight or twelve years . In reply , Kennedy supporters point out that Theodore Roosevelt entered the White House at forty-two , Washington took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence when he was thirty-three . The crosscurrents of the religious issue are far more complex . Undoubtedly sonic Protestant Democrats would vote against Kennedy as a Catholic : undoubtedly sot : titholoc Republicans would vote . ; undoubtedly some Catholic Der would boycott the ticket if they : : t Kennedy had been denied the noi. : . aation because of his Catholicism . How many in each category ? I do n't think anybody knows . Here the opinion p. , " ? : ire a poor guide because nowadt : ? .. ept in the more benightt-.I teas . ns hesitate to admit that as may influence their vote . In Mas. , ? etas , where Kennedy is well known , he has carried communities which are both Republican and Protestant . How about in other states ? One reason for his wide travels may be to dispel religious prejudice , if any , among the people who see him , hear him and question him . He does not hesitate to answer questions on the issue . " Whatever a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " nothing takes precedence over his solemn oath to uphold the Constitution . " And he emphatically supports the First Amendment ? " The separation of church and state is fundamental to our American concept and heritage . " In this field the question of birth control is the most delicate and explosive which Kennedy has had to meet . It arose in late November when the Catholic bishops of the United Suites joined in II statement that Catholics " will not sup-poi t any public assistance , either at home or abroad , to promote artificial birth prevention . , . . " Several non-Catholic leaders promptly asked whether this statement would he binding on Catholic candidates for public office . This put Kennedy , as the leading Catholic candidate , on the spot . He did not dodge the question . The substance of his reply was this . We have to be very careful how we give other countries advice on this subject . Our government does not advocate any policy concerning birth control here in the United States , Nor have we ever advocated such a policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest psychological mistake for us to appear to advocate the limitation of the black or brown or yellow peoples whose population is increasing no faster than in the United States . They must reach decisions on these matters based on their own experience and judgment . . . . I would not think it wise for the United States to refuse to grant assistance to a country which is pursuing a policy it feels to be in its own best interest .... He added that if he were President and the question came before him he would decide it in accordance with his oath to do whatever was best for the interests of the United States . He was asked whether his position on this had been influenced in any way by the statement of the Catholic bishops . He replied . My judgment on this has been held for many years and it continues . " The birth-control issue is an cl : with emotion that it is the dread oi ? politicians . Whatever Kennedy says . it may hurt him . On the other hand , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early , thus giving time for public discussion and reflection . By early December , indeed . President Eisenhower had taken much of the heat out of the issue by declaring that if other governments want to do anything about birth control " that is their business . " And if they want help , he added , " they will unquestionably go to professional groups . " not to our Government . And Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt , often critical of Kennedy . called his birth-control statement " sensible and correct . " Kennedy 's hardest test in the Senate , and the one which many thought would ruin his presidential chances , came in the two weeks preceding the passage of the labor-management reform bill last September . Earlier the Senate had passed a labor bill on which Kennedy had been working for more than two years . It was designed mainly to protect rank-and-file union members from corruption and racketeering . Then , toward the end of the session , the House passed the Landrum-Griffin bill . It included many of Kennedy 's proposal% but added provisions which responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two bills went to Senate-House conference . Kennedy was chairman . This , predicted the predicters , would be the banana peel on which the front-running Kennedy would surely slip and fall . The conference , they said . would produce either no bill at all , which would disappoint the general public demand : or a bill so restrictive that it would lose the labor vote so necessary to a Democratic nominee . Somehow Kennedy kept his footing . In i days and nights of grinding nee , as , he managed to moderate the ft .. : -. her points of Landrum-Griffin and come up with a compromise which overwhelmingly passed both House and Senate . While most labor leaders still called the result a " killer " bill , they had kind words for Kennedy 's part in presenting something worse . Even the acid-tongued Senator Morse , who has been highly critical of Kennedy and of the compromise bill , was moved to say . " In my fifteen years in the Senate I have never seen a conference more ably chaired . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle . " An old friend in the House said , " It proves that Jack is not only smart , persuasive and tough , but lucky . I tell him he could fall into a well and come up dry with two watches running  --  one on daylight and one on standard time . " In his carefully planned and tireless shuttlings about the country , Kennedy has woven a fabric of support perhaps stronger than his rivals realize . At this wnting his confident advisers say he already has assurances of enough votes at the convention to win on the second ballot . But Kennedy knows how such assurances can fade , how strong is the continuing opposition of some of the top parts leaders . He knows he must prove himself in the spring primaries . Still playing it boldly , he plans to put his chances to the test in more primaries than any other candidate . For the connoisseur of presidential sweepstakes. these w ill be contests to watch.                  @ @ @
