Once , successful Civil War memento collectors needed only a vague knowledge of where skirmishes had been fought and a sharp eye for rusty buckles , buttons and musket balls that lay for the taking in the battlefield grass . No more . Since the centennial battlere-enactment craze in the early ' 60s , the search for souvenirs has come to re quire 1 ) the battlefield instincts of a field commander , 2 ) a shovel , 3 ) a strong back , 4 ) a talent for telling lies with a straight face , 5 ) an ability to fend off enraged farmers , 6 ) a snakebite kit and , most important , 7 ) a metal detector . <P> <P> On any springtime-sunny Sunday in the South , particularly in Georgia , where Sherman 's march cut such a vast swath , a widespread ( and individually selfish ) safari of as many as 500 relic collectors can be found crisscrossing carefully over the once bloodied ground . Each wears earphones connected to a long-handled ground-sweeper disk , powered by transistor batteries , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds metal , there is a sudden crescendo to the hum , the signal to dig for an antique that may be anywhere from an inch to 6 ft. down , since little of any value is left on the surface any more . <P> Refighting the Battles . The detectors range in cost from $35 ( for a 30-lb . World War II surplus piece ) to $139.50 ( for a streamlined , 3-lb . Metrotech model ) . The discoveries they have produced range in value from tin cans and tenpenny nails ( worth nothing and found everywhere ) to a $10 California gold piece dated 1849 ( worth $1,250 and found near Savannah ) . <P> Success , the souvenir detectors believe , is a matter of historical background as well as on-the-scene instinct . Gene Purcell , 26 , a seasoned detection expert and proprietor of the Blockade Runners , an Atlanta shop that deals in sales or swaps of Civil War accouterments , outlines the procedure . " I get me a spot on a battlefield , " he says , " and I go sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette , and I think , ' If I were fighting here , where would 1 have dragged a wounded man ? Over behind that big rock . ' So I detect there . Or I figure , ' If the troops left New Hope Church one day and their destination was a day 's journey , where would they likely have camped ? ' So I go to that spot and take the detector . I usually have pretty good luck . " <P> It does n't take much luck for a man to become an addict . Jim Watterson , 31 , an Atlanta luggage salesman , has been detecting for a year . " If anyone had ever told me I 'd be excited about finding some rusty iron in the ground , I 'd have told them they were crazy , " he says . Yet he was at the Blockade Runners last week to show off his weekend treasures - some shell fragments , a pistol ball and a ramrod . <P>                @ @ @ @ @
