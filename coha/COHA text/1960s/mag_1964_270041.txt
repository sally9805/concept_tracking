Bill Hartack obviously gets along with horses lots better than with people . He has no use for sportswriters ( " They 're always misquoting me " ) , racing officials ( " They have too much power " ) , or even his fellow jockeys ( " None of them are my friends " ) . But with horses , Jockey Hartack , 31 , shares a mystical communion . Nobody has ever won so many stakes ( 43 ) or so much money ( $3,000,000 ) in a single season . And when it comes to the biggest race of all , the Kentucky Derby , Hartack is in a class by himself : going into last week 's 90th Derby , he had three victories and one second in five tries . <P> Second Choice . So it was somewhat embarrassing to discover that he was only second choice for the horse he wanted to ride . Willie Shoemaker , a gentler genius , was supposed to ride Northern Dancer , a speedy bay colt owned by Canadian Millionaire E. P. Taylor . But Shoemaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California champion ( TIME , April 24 ) . That left Hartack with Northern Dancer , and a chance to do a little embarrassing of his own . <P> In the paddock , Hartack got his orders from Trainer Horatio Luro , a transplanted Argentine , whose own Derby record ( a first and a third in two tries ) was nothing to scoff at . Luro kept it crisp : Northern Dancer was inclined to sulk when he was whipped . " I told Hartack that I do not care for any punishment , " he said later , " none whatsoever . Beyond that , I did not tell him anything . He knew the horse . And he had won three Derbies , had n't he ? " Odds at post time : 7 to 5 on Hill Rise ; 3 to 1 on Northern Dancer . <P> The field of twelve horses broke from the gate and swept around the first turn . Hartack kept the Dancer under a tight rein . Mr. Brick , a 16 to 1 long shot , set the pace through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Hartack glanced to his right , saw Shoemaker flick his reins to urge Hill Rise forward . That was the signal . Hartack clucked to Northern Dancer , and in one wonderful burst of speed , the little colt bolted past Hill Rise , past Mr. Brick , past everybody , and into the clear . Turning for home , the Dancer had a two-length lead . <P> No More Time . Down Churchill Downs ' long ( 1,2341 ft. ) stretch the horses pounded . On the outside , Hill Rise was ranging up fast . At the furlong pole , just ? mi. from the wire , the Dancer still led by two lengths . Whipping furiously , Shoemaker closed the gap . With 50 ft. to go , Hill Rise 's nose was even with the Dancer 's tail . Two more strides , and he was 1 length behind . Another stride-but there was no more time . The two horses swept past the wire , with Northern Dancer in front by a neck . Track stewards called for a photograph to make sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he sighed . " Lord , how I tried . " <P> In the winner 's circle , the garland of roses from his fourth Derby victory around his horse 's neck , Bill Hartack heard the time : 2 min. flat , and a new record , ? sec. better than the old mark set by Decidedly in 1962-with Bill Hartack aboard .
