performance Peter had planned was useless without Sultan . He went back to the car , wondering about alternatives ; so long as he was out , it seemed a pity to waste the evening . The night was perfect ; scudding clouds , flickering moonlight , a wind keening high in the trees . Still cogitating , he drove the few miles to the other house , parked in his former spot , and climbed the wall as before . As soon as he got through the belt of trees he realized that something was going on . The house was a blaze of light . By now it was well past midnight . Knowing Katharine 's habits , he would not have expected her to be entertaining . The absence of cars in the driveway confirmed the assumption . He wondered what had happened . He investigated the downstairs rooms first , and found lights shining in rooms which were uninhabited , except for the kitchen . The two elderly servants were there ; both had on night attire , with robes over pajamas . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something was boiling on the stove , and the cook was preparing a tray . She looked sleepy and disgruntled . Her husband sat at the table , elbows propped , blinking groggily into a cup of coffee . Peter watched them for a few minutes , and then decided there was nothing to be gainedp81by waiting . With the windows shut he would n't be able to hear anything even if they spoke . The upstairs window he selected had two things to recommend it . Its frontal location , above the room in which the seance had been held , suggested that it might be the master bedroom , and an old oak tree provided a convenient ladder to the small balcony . He swarmed up the tree with only one broken branch to mark his progress ; the snap was lost in the general uproar of the wind . At least he hoped it was . When he stood on the balcony , outside the French doors which were the counterparts of the doors below , he saw that he had struck pay dirt . It was Katharine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of austerity , plain furniture , and walls lined with bookcases , even if the woman herself had not been sprawled face clown across the bed . Tiphaine was bending over her , one hand on her cousin 's shoulder . Every light in the room was on  --  the overhead chandelier , the desk and dressing-table lamps , two bed lamps . Tiphaine 's molten hair threw the light back like a polished bronze mirror , and swung down , half hiding her face . She wore plain white silk tailored pajamas and looked good enough to eat . As Peter moved in closer for a better look , some slight sound must have reached the older woman 's ears , for she sat bolt upright , both hands going out in a spasmodic gesture . " What was that ? " " The wind . Only the wind . Kate , it 's all right ; try to relax . " Katharine nodded . She looked like hell , Peter thought clinically . Her eyes were sunken and a muscle at the corner of her mouth beat frantically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note that the woman who dressed in tailoredslacks and shirt during the day had a less Spartan taste in nightwear . Her gown was pale green ; the full skirt spread out across the bed in agitated ripples the color and opacity of seawater . One slender strap had slipped down off her shoulder . She was definitely too thin . Still , the general effect would have been arresting , if it had not been for the face  --  a study in sheer terror , unmasked . . .  | " There 's someone out there , " she insisted . Peter took one noiseless step backward and stood poised at the rim of the balcony . But Tiphaine shook her head and did not stir . " Kate , I looked . When I first came up . There never was anyonethere . It must have been a dream . " " It was his voice . Saying . . . saying . . " Saying what ? " Tiphaine sat down on the edge of the bed . " Saying he wanted . . . that I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms around her cousin , and Kate caughtat her with frantic hands . " Do n't go away , " she muttered . " Do n't leave me alone . . . A soft knock sounded at the door , and she started violently . " It 's only Mrs. Schmidt , " Tiphaine said soothingly . Shecalled , " Come in . " The cook entered , carrying a tray . The pink curlers looked like some barbaric hair adornment . " This is too hot , " Tiphaine said , taking the cup . " I 'll put some cold water in . " She vanished into the bathroom . Katharine was quiet now , her hands and face controlled ; putting on a good front beforethe servants . It was hard to believe that she was the same woman who had been cowering and moaning a few moments earlier . " Did Will search the house ? " she asked . " Yes , miss . " " Was there  --  anything ? " " Not a sign of anything , miss . " Having seen Will dozing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peter knew the woman was lying . It was fortunate for him that the household had grown accustomed to Kate 's hallucinations ; he could come and go without too much fear of being seen by the Schmidts . Old Will was not the man to prowl the grounds on a cold autumn night unless he had to . And it was becoming clear that he would have to pay Kate More several more visits . The damned woman had nerves , not of steel , but of rubber ; they bounced back after every shock . But not all the way . A few more surprises . . .  |p83Ti|phaine  came back with the cup of tea . Over Kate 's bowed head a significant glance passed between the two other women , and Peter deduced that Tiphaine had added some sort of sedativeto the tea . Kate certainly needed something . Despite her control , her hands shook so badly when she took the cup that tea slopped over onto the bedspread . The cook left , taking the tray , and Tiphaine switched off the overhead light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't leave me . . . " You ca n't sleep with all the lights blazing . I 'll be here , Kate . All night , if you want me . " " Kind . . . " Kate slumped back against the pillows ; in her exhausted state the drug had taken quick effect . The room was now dim except for the circles of light shed by the lamps on the desk and bedside tables . Now , before she sank into drugged sleep , was the time for the next move . Peter climbed onto the roof . It was within arms ' reach of the top of the balcony rail . Hanging head down , held by his knees and one hand , he twisted around so that he could see into the room . It was an uncomfortable position , but he did n't have to hold it long . Just long enough to give the knife the proper flip , that would make it curve down from a high point that was above normal eye level . To a mind already attuned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was the explanation of the poltergeist legend ; careful misdirection by the person responsible for the flying objects , so that no one noticed where they originated . One quick movement of his wrist and it was done ; he saw it thud , the carved hilt quivering , into the wooden footboard of the bed . He twisted himself up and caught the gutter with his other hand . Much as he would have liked to see the results with his own eyes , he could n't spare the time . There must be no sign of a material agent , or the game was spoiled ; this time old Will might actually be moved to look around . He was half way across the roof when the scream began , and it went on for some time , even after he had descended to the ground and was running toward the wall.  |p84Peter  slept the dreamless sleep which is erroneously attributed to the just . There is , after all , nothing like exercise in the fresh air before retiring . When he awoke , he lay still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first part of his project was easier than he had expected . Thanks to Katharine 's own overactive conscience , she was already in a state of extreme nervous tension . The next step was n't going to be so easy . He had never had any hard-and-fast scheme for getting invited to the house , though he had consideredpossible openings . One potential means of entree was definitely out . Katharine was not only unimpressed , she was hostile and suspicious . Tiphaine was a more hopeful prospect , but Peter 's personal vanity was not so exaggerated as to make him believe he could sweep the girl off her feet within the next few days . The very success of the initial phase made haste essential . If Kate went on the way she was going , she might crack up fairly soon . He had to be on hand when the moment arrived , and that meant residence in the house , not casual lurking . Maybe , after all , the hoary old tricks were the best . Without rising , he stretched out one arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a local number . Volz sounded as if he had been up , swinging from the trees , since dawn . Peter moved the telephone three inches away from his ear . He was in luck . The hunt was meeting next day . His second outside call was less productive . Mrs. Martin 's feeble voice informed him that the doctor had gone out on a call late last night and was n't back yet . Peter said he would stop by later that afternoon , and hung up , smiling nastily . He did n't have to ask where Martin had gone . He amused himself for the rest of the morning by a visit to Greer 's Saddlery . He had been tempted to appear next day in old slacks and sweater , but that would have been indulging his sense of humor too far . At Greer 's he contemplated himself in the mirror with a grimace of amusement . The uniform was as archaistic as tights and a doublet , and much more uncomfortable . The white stock tickled his chin , and the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining boots with thep85crop , fingered the chaste gold bar that adorned his stock , and bought the lot , over the moans of Mr. Greer , who insisted that everything needed taking in at the waist . " I 'll tighten my belt , " Peter said shortly , and left , after payingout a sum which made him grimace again , but not with amusement . He went to Martin 's house just after three , and had to wait . Martin had a backlog of patients from that morning . When Peter was finally shown into the sanctum , he found Martin pouring himself a shot from a bottle which normally lived in the bottom drawer of his desk . " Join me ? " " No , thanks . " Peter sat down , looking concerned , and Martinshrugged . " I do n't ordinarily do this . But today has been one of those daYs . " " Not much sleep ? " " None . " Martin swallowed his dosage , made a wry face , and then glanced keenly at Peter . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Peter said vaguely . " God yes . " Martin sighed . " What are people saying ? " " Rather peculiar things . It depends on whom you 're talking to , of course . " " Of course , " Martin said mechanically . " It 's good of you to be so discreet , Stewart , but there 's not much point in discretionwhen the whole damned town is whispering . You 've met Dr. More ? " " Yesterday . And professional reticence is unnecessary with anyone who 's seen her . What 's wrong with the woman ? Drugs ? Guilty conscience ? " " What makes you say that ? " " You mean , what business is it of mine ? Because Tiphaine is out there , two miles from the nearest neighbor , with only a pair of doddering old servants . Drug addicts are n't precisely the safest companions . " " It is n't drugs . " " I do n't give a damn what it is . The woman is unstable . She might  --  hurt Tiphaine. "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're interested in Tiphaine ? " " I 'm in love with her , " Peter said , and met the doctor 's eyes with one of his best candid stares . " Does she reciprocate your feelings ? " Despite his furrowed brows there was a hint of amusement in the doctor 's voice . " I know it sounds ridiculous , " Peter said shyly . " But sometimes it happens that way . . . . No , of course she does n't . Not yet . If I had time . . . but in the meanwhile , what 's happeningout there ? The situation is unhealthy , whatever the cause . " " The situation is even worse than you think , " Martin said , and then fell silent . Peter waited , while Martin filled his pipe ; the doctor 's own concern was warring with his professional caution , and as Peter watched he could almost see the other factors being weighed  --  his own respectable introduction and exemplary behavior , plus the fact that this was n't really . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Martin said . " Of course the problem may be one of hallucinations  --  visual and auditory  --  but she is n't the sort of woman who is ordinarily affected in that way . I 'm afraid , Stewart , that someonehas been playing some malicious and dangerous tricks . " Peter widened his eyes and looked baffled . " Why would anyone do a thing like that ? " " I ca n't imagine . " Martin made a sweeping , frustrated gesture . " It ca n't be personal enmity , so I can only conclude that someone here in town has it in for the family . You may have heard some of the stories about Stephan . . . " Tiphaine told me about his werewolf game . " " It was n't exactly a game , " Martin said . " He was always good to Tiphaine , so naturally she takes his part . But Stephan had a mean streak . He enjoyed frightening people , and he dabbled in some of the nastier magical practices . Katharine herself is n't popular ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , but her charities are , at her own insistence , anonymous , and there are wild tales among the more superstitiousolder residents that she 's inherited Stephan 's talent for magic . Black magic . " " It 's unbelievable , " Peter murmured . " You know better . You 've traveled in backward countryp87areas , must have , to collect your songs . How many witches have you met ? " " A few . But that was England and Scotland , little country villages . This is a modern , sophisticated town . " " Science and sophistication do n't kill superstition , " Martin said heavily . " Look at the newspapers  --  ads for palmists and astrologers , fortune-telling columns . You can find a section " Spiritualists " in the Yellow Pages . Add to that a long traditionof superstition , and you 're in trouble . You 've met Mrs. Adams , at the hotel ? Fine horsewoman , canny businesswoman ; but she 's a member of some wild cult that calls on Mother Earth . Not , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these tricks that are being played on Kate . I visualize someone simpler and more easily frightened . Someone who is suffering from illness or financial trouble , and blames it on Kate . " " But , look here ! " Peter sat up , gripping the arms of his chair . " If some madman thinks she 's put a spell on him  --  the most effective way of canceling such a spell is to kill the witch ! " " That 's what I 'm afraid of . " Martin knocked out his dead pipe . " At first it was simply malice , no physical threats . But last night someone threw a knife . It just missed Tiphaine . " Peter 's look of dismay was genuine this time . Unless Tiphaine had moved at the last moment , he did n't see how the knife could have come anywhere near her . What was Martintrying to prove ? Or had he gotten a hysterical version of the story from two frightened women ? " You have a nice , neat theory , Doctor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Dr. More herself is playing the tricks ? " He expected a bellow of protest . Instead , Martin 's shoulders sagged . " I do n't know why I 'm discussing this with you , " he murinured . " Because you 're worn out and worried sick . Look here , Martin , it 's Tiphaine I care about . Does n't my interest in her give me a right to be concerned ? " Martin nodded heavily , without looking up , and Peter went on earnestly , " I 'm not trying to build a case against Dr. More . I do n't know what top88think  --  except that Tiphaine may be in danger , either from her cousin or as one of those innocent bystanders who are alwaysgetting clobbered by careless assassins . I 'm as anxious to find out the truth as you are . " " Calm down , Peter . I agree completely . " Martin looked at him with a faint , haggard smile . " I must admit , it 's a relief to share this with someone I can trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter said confidently . " What about a hired guard ? " " I suggested that . There is n't a man in the house except old Will , and he 's as timid as a rabbit . Superstitious , too ; his familyhas lived here for three hundred years . But Kate refused . " " She did , eh ? " " Yes , but I may yet convince her . " Martin 's tone was less assured than his words . " I 'm going out there tonight myself . " " I wish I were . Well , if you 're going to be up all night again , I 'd better leave so you can nap this afternoon . " Peter rose . At the door he turned , as if some sudden idea had come to him . " Martin . I wonder . . . " What ? " The doctor looked at him hopefully . " I have n't quite got it worked out yet . But I may need your cooperation . " " Anything . Anything that will help . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He left the office with the smug feeling that for once he had told the simple truth . He simply had n't specified who would be helped by his plan . " One of the reasons why I always hated hunting , " Peter muttered , " is that you have to get up so early in the morning . " His companion , one of the plump matrons whom he had met at the Folklore Society meeting , giggled nervously . She had an improbable name  --  Marlene , or something like that  --  and teeth that looked as if they had been meant to protrude slightly before an orthodontist got his hands on her . " It 's a nice day for it , anyhow , " she said . " For hunting , I mean . It 's not a nice day really . . .  |p89Peter  wiped beads of moisture from his boot . The weather was foul . In Scotland it might have been called a mist ; fog shrouded the lower patches of ground , and moisture collected on every possible surface . Marlene assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it would be a marvelous day . Peter gave her a glance of hatred . Her riding habit was too tight ; the buttons at her middle were strained . At least he would n't have her beside him once the hunt got underway ; she sat her horse , a timid-looking filly , like a blob of jelly , and her hands were nervous on the reins . " The unspeakable chasing the uneatable , " he muttered , and gave Marlene a bland smile as she glanced at him uncertainly . " What did you say ? " " I was admiring your horse . " " She was very expensive , " Marlene said complacently . " My husband raved when he saw the bill . " " He does n't hunt ? " " He does n't do anything , " said Marlene . " Except make money . " " Well , that 's not such a bad occupation . It allows you to buy very expensive horses . " " Not all that expensive , " Marlene said perversely . " Sultan cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve , riding that mean animal . He always tries to bite me . " As if he had understood the words , Sultan stamped and glared . His feeble wits had completely forgotten Peter 's sugar the night before , and twice he had absentmindedly started to nibble his rider 's boot . Peter dealt with that problem the second time . Now Sultan sulked and bided his time . Peter felt fairly sure that the noble steed would head for the first tree he saw , and try to scrape his rider off . " He tries to bite me , too , " Peter said truthfully . " Oops . " He jerked in the saddle and gathered the reins closer . " He seems edgy today . Hope I have n't taken on more than I can handle . " A cacaphony of excited barking announced the arrival ofP90the MFH and his canine entourage . Peter studied the square , squat figure , which looked like a toad in a top hat , with disapproval . " Volz is n't his own Huntsman , I see . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a lot of work . He has the time and the money . He does n't like dogs , but there 's no rule that says he has to be Huntsman . " She trotted off , bouncing emphatically , toward the other riders . Peter pushed his hat back off his aching brow and glanced around . Most of the other members had arrived by now . Mrs. Adams was one of them ; she was at her best in the masculine garb , and the hunt colors she wore testified to her skill . Peter recognized some of the others , from the Folklore meeting . Martin was conspicuously absent , but everyone else who was anybody seemed to be present . All the white folks , that is . Middleburg had its town Negro , a distinguished State Department official , who lived in a particularly isolated house outside the town limits , but the only black face visible here was that of Hilary Jackson , and Hilary was busy trying to hold the pack of yelling hounds . Peter had seen Timmy 's fleeting form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called upon to perform some service . At the moment he was invisible , which suited Peter fine ; the shambling , secretive form looked absolutely eerie sliding along through patches of mist . He touched Sultan 's side and walked the horse over to where Hilary stood , feet braced , magnificent muscles taut against the pull of the leads . He had n't planned to start a conversation , under the eyes of the town gentry ; but he was unprepared for the hostile look Jackson gave him . The boy deliberately looked away , leaving Peter feeling rebuffed . Two hours later he was still feeling rebuffed . He was also bored . They had killed once . As a guest , Peter kept behind , and he made a show of Sultan 's wildness as they stood around the miserable remains of the fox . Sultan reared , in response to a surreptitious jab , and Volz turned from his contemplation of the bloody mess on the ground.  | " Having trouble , Stewart ? " " No , " Peter said . " He 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better go back and change mounts . " " Oh , no , that 's not necessary . " " All right . Just do n't get in the way . " Hounds and riders were off again . The next chase went as Peter had hoped , into the woods . It was a messy sort of forest , overgrown and thick with fallen trees ; he lost himself without any trouble . He got rid of his hat along the way and loosened his stock ; a few swipes with a handy bramble branch gave his face that extra touch of verisimilitude . Then he set off at a leisurely pace toward the edge of Katharine 's property . The wooded area ended about a hundred yards from the stone wall which marked the back boundaries . The wall was lower here in back , easily within a horse 's jumping ability . He reined the stallion in at the edge of the wood . Even from that point he could hear sounds of activity on the other side of the wall . They were odd sounds  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rug . From his early investigations Peter was able to identify the sounds . There was an archery target back here , a good safe distance from the house . He was in luck . Now he would n't have to play his little drama right up under the kitchen windows . He sent Sultan plunging out of the woods at a gallop and put him at the wall . He learned then another reason for Sultan 's high price . The big animal jumped like Pegasus , soaring so lightly that it almost hurt Peter to spoil the picture . He came back into the saddle too hard and too soon ; Sultan came down practically flat-footed , and Peter did n't have to pretend when he lost one stirrup and slipped sideways , like Tom Mix ducking Indian arrows . When he straightened up , he saw that the analogy was only too apt . He was being covered by a pair of steely eyes and an even harder steel point . Katharine wore her usual costume , with a sweater instead of a shirt , and very dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave room for the leather archer 's guard . The pose showed her slight figure to its best advantage , erect ,  |p92balanced  , and straight as the arrow she was aiming at the centerof Peter 's chest . Peter sat very still . The black-and-red-feathered arrow had a field point , not one of the deadly broad-bladed hunting points ; but it was steel , for all that , and the arms that held it had an unmistakable look of competence . Her stance was that of a professional , wrist and arm perfectly straight but not rigid . The bow was equipped with a sight , which confirmed his suspicion that she had done a lot of target shooting . The point of the arrow dropped as he watched her warily , but he was not reassured ; from the point of aim , it was clear that she was pulling an unusually heavy bow for a woman of her size  --  thirty or thirty-five pounds , maybe . " Out , " she said succinctly . " Turn around and go back where you came from . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . " I barely made it the first time . " " You should n't have tried . " " I could n't help it . " She squinted , studying his scratched face and general dishevelment . " I 'm afraid Tiphaine is too impressionable . She raved about your riding . " " Sultan seems a little nervous , " Peter said defensively . He raised one hand to brush his hair back , and Sultan danced . " So he does . How unfortunate . Out . " " But , look here ! I 'm sorry about intruding , but it was an accident . " " I do n't allow hunting , or any other sort of intrusion . If you want to see me , come to the front door . ' ' " But , Dr. More  --  " " Out . " Peter started to expostulate , then closed his mouth and shrugged . He was n't at all sure she would n't shoot him . He turned Sultan . They were not far enough from the wall for a good approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by that time Sultan was so annoyed he did n't care . He flung himself up and barely made it , his heels scraping the stone ; and Peter ,  |p93releasing  reins and stirrups at the same moment , slid ungracefullyout of the saddle . He landed on the outer side of the wall , with a crash and rattle of shrubbery which was as spectacular as he had hoped , and lay as he had fallen , with one eye cocked toward the wall . Katharine 's startled face appeared above it , and Peter closed the eye . He heard her scramble down and approach . He was sprawled on his back , one leg twisted under him . A cold hand touched his forehead , brushing the hair back and lingering on a rising lump . He heard a soft intake of breath and got ready to respond , with pathetic weakness , to cries of feminine distress and pity . " Damn it to hell , " Katharine said to herself . " The stupid fool 's killed himself . " An hour later Peter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discomfort was mitigated by the knowledge that Phase Two of the plan had been successful . Martin had come and gone ; he had given Peter a reproachful look , but one which was tempered by amusement and relief , and he had spoken gravely of possible concussion . In view of the fact that the poor chap was living at the hotel , where service , though splendid , was not designed for the sick . . . " What about the hospital ? " Katharine interrupted . Peter looked up at her from under his lashes as she stood by the bed , fingers tapping impatiently on the footboard . Her mouth was a tight slit and her eyes were narrowed with a fury which the doctor 's diagnosis had only slightly calmed . " You know how crowded we are , Kate . Besides , moving him would be ill advised . If you need help , I might be able to send a nurse . . . . " From your overworked hospital ? Oh , all right , Martin . I ca n't very well throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were n't so damned nice ! " She flung out of the room , closing the door with exaggerated care . Peter grinned at Martin , who answered with a wink and a slight nod toward Tiphaine , who stood by the door . " Just stay in bed and take it easy , " Martin said casually.  | " Tiphaine will keep an eye on you , you do n't really need a nurse . Child , you know what to watch out for  --  bleeding from ears or nostrils , drownsiness , nausea . . . . " I know . " Tiphaine glided forward , giving Peter a smile that made his abused head swim . " Do n't worry , Paul , I 'll take care of him . " When the doctor had left , she sat down on the edge of the bed and took Peter 's hand in both hers . She was very lovely , with her vibrant features and that unbelievable hair , between gold and copper . Peter was wondering how soon he could reasonablyrecover from a slight concussion when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I fell off , " Peter said literally . " You forget , darling , I 've seen you ride . Did someone  --  do something to Sultan ? " " Now what , " Peter said , " would make you think of a thing like that ? " " Stop it . " Color flamed in her cheeks ; she looked beautiful and rather alarming . " The whole town is gossiping about what 's happening here . Paul knows . You 've been talking to him , have n't you ? " " Well , yes . But . . . " So you decided you were going to rush in and rescue us . " The blue eyes were blazing ; the fine hairs lifted about her face as if electrified . " The big hero . Prying and prowling and . . . Why do n't you leave us alone ? Everything was fine until you came . . . Peter , who had been trying ineffectually to get a word in , decided that there was only one way to shut her up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard that several hitherto unnoticed bruises complained ; but after the first twinge Peter was in no state to notice . For the first second or two she twisted like an eel in his grasp . This stage was succeededby one of enthusiastic cooperation . But as soon as his grip relaxed she was up , and out of his arms , in one lithe movement . Peter was left with his mouth open and his arms out . He closed the former , dropped the latter , and looked reproachfullyat Tiphaine.  |p95She  was still flushed , but not with anger ; after a moment her wide mouth curved up and she sat down again . " Bad to worse , " she said , a little breathlessly . " Is that any way to calm a girl 's suspicions ? " " I 'm sorry . " They contemplated one another solemnly for a moment . Then Peter said , " I 'm also a liar . " " I guess I should apologize . " There were lines in her face that should n't have been there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him some time to identify it . He felt like a heel . " I was answering your suspicions , " he said , drowning out the small voice of his conscience . " And explaining  --  in pantomime , that is  --  why I 'm here . " " That 's sweet of you . But unnecessary . There 's no reason why you should worry about me . " " Yes , there is . What 's wrong with Kate ? " Tiphaine was silent , scrutinizing him with an intensity which was almost as uncomfortable as the doctor 's had been . But her questioning eyes were harder to face than Martin 's . Finally she gave a long sigh . " It 's Mark . That 's what is wrong with Kate . " " Who , " Peter said carefully , " is Mark ? " " Someone we  --  Kate used to know . Her . . . well , he was . . " Mmmhmm , " Peter said . " She was in love with him , and he died . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alone . The gun went off , somehow , and killed him . " " I see . And he 's the one she wants  --  " Peter caught himself just in time . He was n't supposed to know about the cult of Mother Earth . " To forget , " he ended lamely . Tiphaine did n't seem to have noticed the tiny pause . " That 's the trouble , she ca n't forget him . It 's been almost a year , but she 's still  --  haunted . " Peter leaned back against his pillow . " He must have been quite a guy . " " He was , " Tiphaine said softly , " quite a guy . "  | " You liked him too ? " " Liked him ? Mark ? " She considered the question , smiling faintly , eyes remote . " You did n't like Mark . You hated him or you were crazy about him . " She smiled suddenly , mockingly . " Most men hated him . " " Oh , that type . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess he was . . . sort of . Women adored him . That was enough to make other men dislikehim , " she added with a worldly air . " And he could be pretty sarcastic . One look , and one comment in that drawly voice of his , and people just shriveled . " " I do n't think I 'd have liked him , " Peter said . " Probably not . Though you reminded me of him , at first , " she said thoughtfully ; and Peter thought , hell , not again . " Until you kissed me , " she added . " I gather you have a basis for comparison , " Peter said coolly . He had been wondering why he was so ridiculously jealous of a dead man . " Mark kissed all the girls . No offense , no hard feelings . " Smiling , she put out a delicate finger and ran it down his face from temple to cheek to mouth . " You 're dying to know what the difference is , are n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the spread . " What are you up to now ? Distraction ? " " But there 's nothing else to say , " she exclaimed . " I do n't know any more . " " I think you do . " " Then  --  if I do  --  I ca n't tell you . " She stood up and started for the door . With her hand on the knob , she turned to look at him . " But I 'm glad you 're here , Peter , " she said softly  |p97As  soon as the household had gone to bed , Peter prowled . No incidents were scheduled for that night  --  it would be too suspicious , on his first night in the house  --  but he wanted to get the interior geography of the place clear in his mind . After an hour of sitting in the dark , his night vision was complete . He could n't risk even the smallest light , not with the householdin its present state of nerves . Like the downstairs , with its wings and additions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in full use , the one over the huge seance room he had seen the first night . It had one corridor with rooms on either side . Katharine'srooms , the master suite , occupied the entire end of the wing . His room was as far away from hers as possible , next to the staircase . Tiphaine 's smaller chamber adjoined her cousin 's , and there were two other rooms , empty guest chambers . Peter approved the thick carpeting of the corridor , which muffled footsteps , and was happy to find that door hinges and knobs were well oiled . He discovered this by looking into the two unoccupied rooms ; he would like to have ascertained whether Katharine locked her door , but was afraid to try it . Ten to one she was lying awake , staring into the darkness ; the slightest sound , at door or window , would set her screeching.  |p98If  he were in her shoes , he would n't know what to do about locks . Do you lock the door against intruders , or leave it unlockedso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghosts are n't hindered by locks and bolts . The room across the hall from Tiphaine 's was as dark as the proverbial cow 's interior , once he had closed the door . Shades and curtains were drawn , and he had to inch his way across the floor , feeling with hands and feet . He did n't pull the drapes back ; they were on rings , which might rattle . Instead he slid between them , raised the blind , and pushed back the bolt that kept the window locked . The first gust of wind set the drapes swinging and produced a slight rattle from the rings . Peter pulled his head back in and got the window shut in a hurry , though he doubted that the sound had been loud enough to rouse anyone . He had seen enough . The window ledges were wide and the wall was covered with vines and trellises . A careful climber could get around from this room to Kate 's balcony . He was on his way out of the room when another idea came to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom adjoining his room was meant to serve this room too . The connecting door was closed , but the bolt on this side was not drawn . Peter studied it for a moment , and a slow smile spread over his face . Yes , it was definitely an idea ; and a nice effect it would make , too , if he could work it properly . He spent the next half hour practicing , with a shoelace and a drawing pin  --  they called them thumbtacks here  --  which had held back the curtains in his room . The shoelace was too thick , naturally ; he would have to get another kind of twine , white or transparent plastic , that would n't show against the white paint of the door . Plastic fishline , that was the stuff ; strong enough to do the job , and thin enough to slide easily through the crack between door and doorframe . He could pick that up in town tomorrow , along with some white-head thumbtacks . At least he had the positions of the latter figured out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , so there would n't be any betraying holes after the pins were removed.  |p99He  returned to his room through the bathroom , and went on through into the hall . The servants did n't sleep in this wing , and it would be a good idea to locate their bedrooms , so he would know how to avoid them . The Schmidts slept at the other end of the house , over the kitchen ; Peter identified the room some distance away by the resounding duet of snores . A good safe distance from the gentry , near the cook 's domain ; still , if he had been Katharine he would have gathered them in closer . He doubted whether they  --  would hear a machine gun , let alone a scream , over the sounds of their own snores . He wanted to explore the downstairs , particularly the library . He fancied he would find Katharine 's working desk there , and he was curious to see whether papers , such as her bank receipts , would contain any interesting material . But he decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , to calm her nerves . Then the next performance would hit her even harder . Peter spent the morning in bed , catching up on his sleep . It was a very comfortable bed . The cook brought him his lunch , but refused to be inveigled into conversation . Philosophically Peter turned his attention to food . It was excellent . All the homely women he had met so far in this peculiar town were splendid cooks . He wondered if the converse was true . After lunch he decided that he had loafed long enough , and got dressed . The sound of guitar music led him to the living room . Tiphaine was wearing stretch pants and a striped jersey in an electric shade of green that made her hair blaze like a fire . She looked up from the guitar in her lap with some surprise . " Should you be up ? " she asked . " No bleeding from the ears , no excessive drowsiness , no  --  " " I have n't been a very good nurse , have I ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become her , Peter decided . " I have n't been a very good patient , " he admitted , droppinginto a chair . " I got bored , I 'm afraid . Sing something . " She did some of the familiar ones , " Venezuela " and " Bar/bara Allen " ; then she began " The False Lover Regained , " and Peter obligingly joined in . They did several other songs together , but Tiphaine 's voice had lost some of its sparkle ; before long she put the guitar down and leaned forward , chin on her hands . " Peter . How much longer are you going to stay ? " " I 'll leave today , if you want me to . " " You will ? " " I 'll leave the house . But I 'll be sitting out there tonight , watching your window . Probably in a patch of poison ivy , " he added more lightly . " That 's the sort of thing that generallyhappens to my grand gestures . " She gave him a slow , bewitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being worried about me ? " Peter decided , against his will , that his lady love was a bit laborious . " Yes , I really meant it . " " And I meant it when I said I was glad you were here . I wanted to tell you  --  look out , someone 's coming . . . . She struck a chord at random . Peter leaned back , hands clasped around his raised knee . " If you sing Greensleeves , ' " he said in a loud voice , " I 'm leaving . " " How did you know ? " Tiphaine played up beautifully , raisingher own voice just a little . " That old familiar E minor chord . Not that you do n't have the voice for it . It 's just that I 've rendered that cursed song , and heard it rendered , at every school and village concert since I was three years old . It palls . It 's beautiful , but it palls . " He turned his head casually , and then started to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , framed in the doorway . " I 'd feel bad if gallantry made you swoon at my feet . " After that , of course , he had no choice but to rise . " If that really worries you , you 'd better sit down yourself . " Kate dropped onto the sofa and reached for a cigarette . " Do n't let me interrupt you . Maybe now I 'll hear thosefamous verses . " " Glad to oblige , " Peter said . He had spent some of his sparep101time that morning polishing the said verses . Silently Tiphaine handed him the guitar . " Interesting , " Kate said when he had finished . She blew out a cloud of smoke which hid her expression , but her voice held a note Peter did n't like at all . It was amused , and a little respectful . Still , it was the most pleasant tone he had heard from the lady so far . " I 've been thinking , Tiphaine , " she went on casually , " that perhaps Mr. Stewart ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick it could have been cut with a knife . Tiphaine sat motionless , hands clasped on her knee . " It 's up to you , " she said finally . " But do you think .. . ? " Kate 's hand moved to her mouth ; she took a deep drag on her cigarette . " Oh , I definitely do think . " Tiphaine turned her head so that the waves of hair veiled her face , and Peter said easily , " What 's the meeting about ? More folklore ? " " A little experiment , " Kate said . " I sha n't tell you about it in order not to prejudice you . Unbiased observers are so important , do n't you think ? " " Definitely , " Peter murmured . Their glances locked , and once again he was aware of that strong , physical pull which had nothing to do with likes and dislikes . To cover his confusionhe ran his fingers over the guitar strings , and Kate said sweetly , " You have such a pleasant voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Some other gem from your own privateresearches . " Dinner that night was as good as the meals Peter had been getting on trays , if not better . They ate this one in the formal dining room downstairs , en famine . His hostess had said nothingabout dressing for dinner , so Peter was surprised to see her sweep into the room in what was almost formal evening attire  --  a long red skirt , which rustled and flared as she walked , and one of her favorite tailored blouses , silk this time , with wide sleeves caught at the wrists by jeweled links , and a barbaricp102tangle of gold and colored stones around her neck . Tiphaine wore something blue , pale and flowing . In her case , one noticedthe girl rather than the clothes . Conversation was spasmodic . Toward the end of the meal Kate fell into a frowning silence and did n't even pretend to follow the talk of the other two . Her hands were restless , toyingwith the silverware , and with her wineglass . They waited on themselves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , and Kate was pouring coffee when Peter heard the doorbell chime . A few minutes later Martin entered , pulling off his driving gloves . His face was ruddy and his hair windblown . " Colder tonight , " he announced , putting his hand on Kate 's shoulder . " Thanks , I would like some coffee . My heater seems to be on the blink . " " You ought to trade that old wreck in , " Tiphaine said . " Ca n't afford it . " Martin sat down at Kate 's left and accepted a steaming cup of coffee . " No self-respecting dealer would offer me more than a couple of hundred on a trade-in , so I might as well wear it out . " A casual conversation , over coffee , with old friends  --  but it was n't even a good performance , Peter thought . The women were both tense as horses before a storm , and Martin 's eyes kept coming back to Kate 's face . All pretense ended when Kate broke into a discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in tonight , Paul . " Martin could n't he much of a poker player , his face was too mobile . It registered first surprise , then pleasure . " Good , " he said emphatically . " We need a skeptic . " " But I 'm not , " Peter said blandly . " I believe in everything . Ghosts , and werewolves , and succubi  --  " " We 'd better go , " Kate said , starting to her feet . She was white to the lips . Mrs. Adams was already in the seance room when they got there , and Peter wondered uneasily whether the woman had the run of the house , and her own key . She was squatting , in an ungainly fashion , tracing some design on the polished floor with a piece of chalk . In her trailing robes she ought to havep103looked absurd ; but when she straightened up and turned her hard green eyes on him , Peter had no desire to laugh . " Evening , everybody . Mr. Stewart . " " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I knew he 'd be here . " " How ? " " They told me . " Her voice was brusque , almost impatient , quite unlike the mystical whine in which Peter had heard similar announcements made . Somehow this effect was more chilling . Peter inspected the room with the sort of interest he might he expected to display on seeing it for the first time . It looked much the same as it had that other night , except that now it was brilliantly lit by two crystal chandeliers . The altar was in place , with fresh candles in the holders . The only difference was the odd diagram which Mrs. Adams had just finished inscribing in the middle of the floor . It consisted of four concentric circles , of considerable size ; the innermost was about four feet in diameter , with each additional circle adding another foot or so . In the center was the familiar six-pointed star , each point ending in a cross , with cabalistic signs occupying each outer angle . The three outer circles had crosses alternating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make out a few of them : Jehova , Adonai , Agia . " Agrippa 's circle , " he said . " So it 's a good spirit you 're summoning , is it ? " The listeners were visibly impressed , and Peter thanked his encyclopedic memory and his childhood interest in the macabre . " Is that what it is ? " Martin said . " I 'm afraid this particular aspect of folklore has never interested me . " " Since you are an adept , " Mrs. Adams said , " Perhaps you would like to perform the ceremony ? " " I 'm no adept , not even a humble practitioner of the Art . Nor is it my specialty . I 'll leave the witchcraft to you , Mrs. Adams . " Tiphaine chuckled softly , but Mrs. Adams was unmoved.  | " The Art is not witchcraft  --  as you know quite well , Mr. Stewart . All right , we 've got to start pretty soon . The hour is propitious after eight and before nine . Where are the Schmidts ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance , and Mrs. Adams moved to the altar . " Lights , " she said  --  for all the world like a bloody film director , Peter thought disgustedly . Will Schmidt found the switch , and the room plunged into darkness . Darkness complete and without alleviation . The drapes covering the windows were drawn tight . Then a faint glow of light appeared . Mrs. Adams had lit the first candle  --  by secondsight , Peter presumed . The other candles followed , and in the sickly half-light the priestess turned and genuflected toward the altar . She turned the wrong way , though , and a genuine chill ruffled the hair on Peter 's neck . Agrippa and the good spirits be damned ; if this old hag was n't a witch , and a black one at that , he would eat his shoes . He did n't believe that she was going to summon up any spirits , good or evil . But in a sense she was just as much a witch as the poor bedlamites who were burned for that crime during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was . The atmosphere was already curdling ; his first instant distaste for Mrs. Adams was intensifying into full-blown repulsion . Mrs. Adams poured some of the liquid from the pitcher into the basin . The liquid was hot ; the effect of the steam rising around the old woman 's wrinkled features and barbaric hair was enough to set a nervous person screaming . From somewhere in her ample robes Mrs. Adams pulled out a little bag and threw a pinch of its contents into the steaming bowl . A sharp acrid smell of something nasty rose up . Peter coughed . With peremptory gestures Mrs. Adams beckoned them into the circle , cautioning them in sharp whispers not to scuff out any of the lines . Peter doubted that , in the darkness , the precautioncould have been observed . He was n't particularly worried about it . The magic circle was for the protection ofP105the magician and his friends , in case the spirits summoned got out of hand . Either Adams was a true believer in which case no spirits were going to materialize , or she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which case chalk lines would n't be much protection . Peter did n't know what to expect , but he wanted to be prepared for anything ; he spent the next few minutes of the ceremony cautiously removing his shoes . The witch was now holding a short stick or baton  --  her magic wand  --  which she had produced from among the folds of her robe . Raising the wand she intoned the words , " Raphael , Rael , Miraton , Tarmiel , Rex . " The circle was crowded , with all of them in it , but no one moved . It was also far enough from the dull candlelight so that Peter found it hard to tell who was who ; he was surrounded by dark , heavily breathing shapes , and for a mad moment it seemed to him that there were more such shapes than there had been at first . Then he caught a faint gleam from Tiphaine 's hair , and felt a warm hand fumble and slip into his hand . He gave it a reassuring squeeze and let it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Infernal powers , you who carry disturbance into the universe , leave your somber habitation and render yourselves to the place beyond the Styx . If you hold in your power him whom I call , I conjure you , in the name of the King of Kings , to let this person appear at the hour which I will indicate . " The voice stopped , and Peter raised his drooping head . Damn the woman ; the words were prosaic , almost pedantic , but the tone was hypnotic as hell . Again he speculated about drugs . Something in the coffee at dinner ? Something in that vile-smelling liquid in the bowl ? Adams stepped back out of the circle and Peter took advantage of her movement to shuffle out of Tiphaine 's reach . He could see why she wanted to hold hands , and he would have enjoyed it himself , for other reasons . But if he decided to take a walk , he did n't want any clinging fingers holding him back . Crouching , Mrs. Adams sprinkled something over the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peter knew it was n't either one . Then she rose to her full height , stretched out her wand , and shouted , " May he who is dust wake from his sleep . May he step out of his dust and answer to my demands , which I will make in the name of the Father of all men . " Nice , ambiguous invocation , Peter thought , trying to keep his critical sense awake under the bombardment of gibberish . Sounded like an appeal to the Christian God ; but the witches used the same terms for their dark Master . What a voice the woman had ! She bellowed like a bull . But her shrieks were spookier than the usual medium 's shivery whisper . And , in a dreadful fashion , they made better sense . The voice that summonsthe strengthless dead must carry a long , long way . Mrs. Adams squatted again and flung two small objects down among the scattered dirt on the floor  --  white , hard objects , that contacted the wood with a brittle click . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to peto et videre queo ! " She made a series of rapid gestures with her hands . All the candles went out . Momentarily impressed , Peter realized that it had been expertlegerdemain . He had seen good stage magicians do that with candles . The smell of hot wax did not overcome the pungent smell of the liquid , which now seemed overpowering . Peter felt his head spin . The room was closed in , and dead ; yet he had a sense that somewhere , someone was waiting . After the first startled gasp the others had fallen silent , but Katharine'sbreath rattled in her throat . If anything was going to appear , it would appear now . The ceremony was complete , the adjuration had been made . More practically , the total darkness was very useful to the appearance of nonspiritual spirits . Peter left his shoes and slid away . It was so dark he could n't see his hand in front of his face , so he felt sure his absence would n't be noticed immediately . Only his sense of location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going . The door or the window , both at the far ends ofP107the room . He suspected the latter . It was a convenient spot for materialization , as he knew from personal experience . Something was happening , down there by the windows . The curtains were moving , back from the center . He heard the rattle of the wooden rings and saw a pale rectangle appear , and widen . The light seemed bright after the intense blackness . Only one problem . There was no one in sight who could have pulled those drapes . The figure did not appear in the window , as he had . They  --  whoever they were  --  had had more time to plan their effect . It was a good one , too . The figure that rose slowly up from the floor was featureless , only a black silhouette  --  a man 's silhouette , that of a young man , erect and slender . Peter , halfway between the stunned , huddled group in the circle and the " materialization , " stopped short as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar . It looked . . . it looked like . . . " God Almighty , " he said in a whisper which echoed through the hushed room . Then he launched himself in the longest tackle he had ever made in his life . He was so relieved when his outflung arms met solid , humanflesh that he almost lost his grip . " Lights , " he yelled , and added an expletive as a pair of very material teeth found his hand . The creature he was holding had turned into an animal ; wriggling , writhing , kicking , biting , it kept him fully occupied till the lights finally went on . Blinded , Peter fought off one final spasm ; then his opponent subsided into a sobbing heap , and Peter , slightly nauseated , rose to his feet . It was Timmy , of course ; he was unique , though the marred face was now hidden in his bent arms . Martin was the one who had responded to Peter 's demand for light . He came trotting down the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself over in a violent spasm . His body stiffened , his eyes rolled back into his head , and a trace of foam appeared at the corner of his distorted mouth . Peter stepped back , and Martin dropped to his knees by the writhingbody , mercifully hiding the ghastly face.  | " Epilepsy ? " Peter asked . " Yes . Poor devil , that on top of everything else . " Martin shifted slightly to one side and Peter saw , before he hastily averted his eyes , that the doctor had jammed a folded handkerchiefinto Timmy 's mouth . " That 's all I can do now ; the attack should pass off in a few minutes . No , Kate , do n't look at him , he 's not  --  a very attractive sight . " Kate stopped where she was , a good ten feet away . Her face looked like a death mask , skin stretched whitely over the bones ; but under her pallor there was a look of pitiful relief . " Timmy ? " she said . " Only . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said bitterly . He had unconsciously been scrubbing at his hands with his own handkerchief ; looking down at it , he was surprised to see that it was stained with red . Katharine 's eyes followed his . " You 're hurt , " she said ; and Peter , fascinated , watched a new trickle slither down from under his cuff . " He 's got a knife , " he said urgently , turning to the doctor . " Find it before he wakes up , for God 's sake . " " Here it is . " Martin pulled it out from under the body , whose spasms seemed to be subsiding . " Lucky he did n't fall on the blade . " " Lucky for whom ? " Peter asked nobody in particular . He pushed back his sleeve and found a slit in shirt and skin which ran for several inches along his forearm . Martin took his hand and pulled it down to eye level . " Had a tetanus shot lately ? That 's good ; the knife is an ordinary switchblade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with Timmy is bound to be filthy . It 's just a cut , Kate can handle the first aid . I 've got to get this boy to the hospital right away . " Peter nodded , distracted by this description of Timmy . He could n't be very old , at that ; but it was hard to think of him in terms of anything so normal as years old . Now that he had had it brought to his attention , the cut was beginning to sting . In the excitement he had n't even noticed when it was inflicted.  | " Shall I call an ambulance for you ? " Katharine asked calmly . Martin shook his head . " No , no , he 'll be all right when he comes out of it , just a little shaky . I 'll drive him myself . There  --  it 's passing now . " Timmy 's legs were flat , except for an occasional twitch . As the doctor lifted his patient 's filthy head , Peter turned away . " Come upstairs , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Kate said . " I 'd leave the TLC to Tiphaine , but she 'll be busy soothing Bertha for some time yet . " Peter glanced at the group that was still huddled in the circle . Tiphaine , white-faced and tight-lipped , had her arms around the cook 's heaving shoulders . Will Schmidt was n't beingmuch help ; he looked as if he wanted to run . Peter followed Katharine 's rustling skirts to the door and then stopped . " I do n't want to bleed all over that Persian rug . " Turning , she took him by the wrist and raised his arm . " Your shirt 's ruined anyway , " she said unconcernedly . " Drip down into your sleeve . " Her fingers were firm and cold as ice . The contact , the first physical one that had occurred between them , startled both , and for a second Katharine stood motionless , staring at their joined hands . There was blood on her fingers now , and when she turned away and started up the stairs , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding her skirts with the other . At the top of the stairs she stopped with a sudden startledintake of breath and whirled , so abruptly that she almost bumped into him . " Peter . I just realized  --  " " What ? " " It was Timmy . Only Timmy . " " Yes . Just a crude , cheap trick , " Peter said soothingly . He had underestimated the lady ; this time she was not seeking reassurance . She shook her head impatiently . " No , no , that 's just it . How could he have done anything so stupid ? We 'd have recognized him . " " It was pretty dark . . . . "  | " It would n't have been . " From a pocket hidden in the sweeping folds of her skirt she produced a small flashlight . Peter 's lips pursed in a silent whistle , and he studied her resolute face with reluctant admiration . " Timmy did n't plan this , " he said thoughtfully . " He has n't the wits . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have taken precautions . Timmy 's face is unique . He would have been supplied with  --  is that what you 're think-ing ? " " A mask , yes . You did n't search him ? " " I did n't even know he had a knife , " Peter said ruefully ; and her face softened , minutely . " I 'm sorry , I forgot . Come along . " Ten minutes later she surveyed her handiwork critically , and nodded . " I 'll ask Martin to have a look at it in the morning , but that should do . You 're looking a little green . Have you any other injuries ? " " No , " Peter said , trying to ignore the various areas which Timmy 's feet and fists had contacted . " Do you need any help getting to bed ? " Peter looked at her . After a moment the corners of her mouth turned up , stiffly , as if not used to such exercise , and she said , " I 'll send Will up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered what she would look like if she really smiled . The sardonic grimace that passed for that expression was n't really a smile ; it never reached her eyes . " While I 'm thinking about it . . . " Katharine reached for the telephone by the bed and dialed a number . " Is Dr. Martin there yet ? . . . Yes , please . I 'll wait . . . . Paul , it 's Kate . Everything all right ? . . . Good . I want to ask you something . It occurred to me that Timmy might have been prepared for a masquerade . Could you check to see whether he had any sort of disguise , - a wig or a mask , tucked away ? One of those thin plastic masks would fit into a pocket . . . .  |p111She  listened , and her face changed . " Oh . I see . . . No , that 's all right . Good night , Paul . " She hung up . " They looked through his clothing when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul stuff . " " No mask ? " " No nothing . Good night , Mr. Stewart . Thank you . " " You called me Peter before . " " A momentary aberration . " She went out , closing the door emphatically . Richard is himself again , Peter thought . At least she had the grace to say thanks . Damn the woman , she had a brain like a razor . She was n't thanking him for the damage he had incurred on her behalf ; that had been pure bad luck , and she gave it precisely the value it deserved . She was thankinghim for helping to restore her slipping grasp on reality . He slid between the sheets with a muffled groan . He was going to have a few sore spots tomorrow . Damn Timmy , too . . . . That same keen brain of Kate 's would n't miss the other implications of this evening 's fascinating performance . It had worked out fine , just as well as anything he could have engineered . Give her another day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that , by no stretch of the imagination , could the figure she had seen on the balcony have been that of Timmy . To wonder why anything so unconvincing as Timmy had been presented at all . To begin to imagine horrorsall the worse for being unknown . One more day , then a quick , hard blow straight to the core of the problem . That ought to do it.  | " You let him go ? " Peter repeated incredulously . The news took his mind momentarily off his aches and pains ; Martin was rebandaging his arm , and was being unexpectedly heavyhandedabout it . " What else could I do with him ? " " I can think of several things . " " He is n't aggressive , " Martin said . " He fought back when you attacked him , as any animal would . " " Attacked him ! " " Oh , you had to , I 'm not blaming you . But that 's all he is  --  an animal , barely functioning beyond instinctive behavior . What else could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pretty horrible . Volz knows how to handle Timmy . I 've told him about the knife , and he 's promised to keep a closer eye on the poor devil . Of course , if you insist on preferring charges . . . They were in Martin 's office . Peter had driven himself to town instead of waiting for the doctor to make a house call , so that he could pick up his belongings from the Inn . Kate had indeed been thinking . She had come in with Peter 's breakfast tray and asked him to stay on for a few days . She mentioned his desire to do some reading in Stephan 's library ,  |p113but  neither of them was fooled by that excuse . Timmy 's downfall had convinced her , if not of Peter 's bona fides , at least of his usefulness . " Oh , the hell with it , " Peter said . " Why should I prefer charges ? " " That 's decent of you , " Martin said gratefully . " Wait a minute , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day or two anyway . " Peter started to protest and then thought better of it . He had no objection to publicity , nor to appearing more helplessthan he was . Beneath his satisfaction at the way things were working out , a small ugly doubt festered . Since he had n't engineered the Timmy episode  --  who had ? " I suppose Mrs. A. is keeping quiet this morning , " he said casually . " I had a few words to say to her , " Martin admitted , with a faint smile . " Of course she denies putting Timmy up to it . " " Who else could have done it ? " " The evidence certainly seems to point to her . Still . . . The doctor stepped back to inspect his work , and nodded . " Still , I was frankly surprised . She 's a genuine fanatic ; really believes in all that nonsense . I would n't have thought she 'd descend to trickery . " " Is n't that one of the odd vagaries these people have ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagrant deceit , who stoutly maintained that the rest of the phenomena were genuine . " " I know . As you say , it 's a psychological quirk and we just have to accept it . But I think I put the fear of God into Mrs. Adams . She wo n't be trying anything else . " Peter did n't voice his skepticism . Mrs. Adams was a tough customer  --  too tough , he suspected , for the mild doctor . Still , Martin had a way with him and perhaps he could be forceful when he got angry enough . As he went along the hall , trying to keep his coat from falling off the shoulder whose sleeve was n't occupied , a dim little figure darted out from under the stairs . " Oh . . . Mrs. Martin . " Peter relaxed . " You startled me . "   " You ought to button that coat , " she said faintly , and did so . Then she looked up at him , her hands still on his coat front . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you staying in Middleburg ? " " I do n't know . I thought  --  " " Sssh . " Her hands covered his mouth . " Please , not so loudly . You must go away . Go away now . And take her with you . " " Who ? " Peter obediently lowered his voice . " Tiphaine ? " " No , no . No . The other one . Today , go today . Next week will be  --  " The office door opened and Mrs. Martin froze . " Oh . . . my dear . I see you had the same thought I did , " Martin said affectionately . " Have you persuaded Mr. Stewart to stay for a cup of coffee ? " She shook her head mutely . " Mrs. Martin was kind enough to come to my rescue , " Peter said . " 1 must have looked like a contortionist coming down the hall . " " Oh , I see . Should have thought of it myself . How about that coffee , though ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Will I see you later ? " " Tomorrow , if not this afternoon . I 'll be out . " " Good . Thank you , Mrs. Martin . " At the door he hesitated for a moment , looking back into the semidusk of the hall ; but Mrs. Martin had already disappeared . Timmy was n't the only one who was a little off . But the cause of Mrs. Martin 's distress was only too obvious , and too normal . Martin had been spending a lot of time with a younger , richer , more attractive , woman . Even without the millions , Kate 's physical attraction was enough toPeter stopped himself right there , none too pleased at the direction his thoughts were taking . It was almost the end of October , and if he stayed around much longer , he was going to start liking this part of the world . The sunlight was warm and seductive , with justP115enough snap in the air to be invigorating . A carpet of colored leaves covered streets and sidewalks and lawns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and red . As he strolled down the street , he passed children rolling in leaf piles , shrieking with pleasure . The busy rakers were almost all black , and as Peter walked on he noticed something . As soon as they saw him coming , they retreated . It was n't just his imagination . One man , who had worked his heap of fallen leaves almost up to the sidewalk , literally dropped his rake and fled . On impulse he turned right , onto a side street , instead of continuing toward the shopping area . This was a block of smaller houses , and there were fewer hired workers . Peter went on at a deliberately leisurely pace , like a visitor admiringthe well-tended gardens and neat lawns . Then it happenedagain . The yardman , a young fellow of about Jackson 's age , took his rake with him when he retreated , but the intentwas the same . Peter proceeded , frowning . Small incidents , both of them , but they were disturbing , because they recalled other incidentsand impressions which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he had thought of it as a cat-town , pretending to sleep , but watching through slitted eyes . . . maybe it had n't been just a neurotic fancy . Maybe his busy subconscious mind had been formulating data which he had n't consciously noticed . When he roused himself from his musings , he realized that he was in a part of town which he had n't explored . He could n't be far from the center of town ; it was ridiculous to get lost in a hick town the size of Middleburg . He turned right , went on a few steps  --  and found himself facing a big white house , built in the gingerbread style of the i88o 's . It looked like many of its neighbors , except for one thing  --  a sign which read " Middleburg Historical Association and City Museum . " There must be someone in the museum who could give him directions . He turned up the walk . On the front door another sign gave the hours : g to 5P116weekdays , 1 to 5 Saturdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one in sight when Peter stepped into the hall , which was furnished like that of an ordinary dwellinghouse except that the antique furniture bore neat labels , and the walls were covered with old prints and paintings . A door on the right opened , just a crack , and a face peered out , a thin spectacled face crowned with an untidy coil of gray hair . Peter recognized the woman who had been introduced to him at the Folklore Society meeting . Miss . . . Device  --  thatwas it ; he remembered the name because it had struck a familiar note , though he could n't remember offhand where he had heard it . Either Miss Device needed a new pair of glasses , or she was preoccupied ; it was several seconds before her thin lips cracked in a smile of welcome . She came out of the other room in sections , first an arm , then a leg modestly covered by heavy stockings and a skirt which reached three inches belowher knee , then the rest of her body . " Mr. Stewart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay us a visit . " She looked as if she meant it ; the greedy gleam in her gray eyes reminded Peter of other faces , those of guards and curatorsin various unpopular tourist attractions which he had had occasion to visit . The poor devils got bored , sitting around all day with no one to talk to , and when an unwary visitor did appear , they leaped on him like ghouls . Peter sighed , but not audibly . It would be gauche and unkindto tell the woman that he had only been looking for directions . It would also be useless . He was n't going to get out of here without the full tour . First he heard the interminable , dull life history of every town worthy whose portrait adorned the walls of the entrance hall . The contents of the next room were no more enthralling . The objects lovingly preserved in glass cases were just as boring as the ones he had viewed in little local museums abroad : old letters , receipts for tallow and wool and tobacco , corroded tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have passed straightp117through the next room . But this exhibit , which filled half a dozen cases , was clearly her pride and joy , and a blush coloredher thin cheeks as she admitted that she had done the work with her own hands . " It took me over ten years , " she said . Peter murmured something appreciative , and gave the contentsof the nearest case a closer look . They were clever , if you cared for that sort of thing : dolls , dozens of dolls , dressed with meticulous attention to detail in the costumes of the various historical eras since the founding of the town . Bearded courtiers of the time of James I , in cloaks and ruffs ; little-girl dolls in homespun gowns and caps ; a court lady dressed in satin , with a diminutivelace collar and curled ringlets . Intrigued , Peter bent over the case . The lady 's curls looked like real hair , and the face , modeled out of clay or  --  no , something finer  --  wax , perhaps ; was so individualistic as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next case , which contained costumes of the eighteenth century  --  workmen in leather aprons , ladies in towering powdered wigs , gentlemen in embroidered waistcoats . These were no ready-made dolls , dressed by a clever seamstress ; the figures themselves had been individually modeledand painted . The exhibit was an impressive piece of work , and Peter said so ; this time , for a change , his good manners paid an unexpected dividend . Miss Device became so flustered that she excused herself and left him alone . Peter glanced again at the dolls . His unexpressed opinion would not have pleased Miss Device ; he was brooding on the sterility of ten years spent on such a hobby . The ancient and no doubt honorable line of the Device family was ending with the conventional whimper . Once again the name struck that odd note of familiarity , but try as he might he could n't place it . He had had enough of dolls and shy spinsters , and just about enough of the prim little museum . He might as well go on through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to sneak out without Miss Device 's seeing him . P118But the next room was something of a surprise . The contentswere familiar enough , but they seemed out of place in this tidy Victorian house . Not so incongruous to the room was the figure which stood , hands clasped behind its back , staring at a particularly elegant example of a pillory . " Hello , General , " Peter said . " I did n't know you liked museums . " Volz turned . " So you 're up and about , are you ? What 's the idea of damaginga perfectly good stablehand ? " He snorted . Evidently this was supposed to be a joke . " You people amaze me , " Peter said . " Back in the old countrywe have our share of village idiots , but we do n't accept their iniquities quite so casually . " " Like hell you do n't . Old Sam , who beats his wife to a pulp whenever he gets drunk ; little Mamie , who sets fire to things . . . You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damned British arrogance , " he added , and went off into a paroxysm of grating laughter . Feeling himself at a slight disadvantage  --  the old so-and-so definitely had a point  --  Peter joined him as he turned his fascinated gaze back toward the infernal device before him . The wood had weathered over the years , but was still intact . Rusty chains dangled from the cross bars , and the holes were suggestive , even now . Flanking the pillory were the stocks , with holes for hands and feet instead of for the head , and an object which Peter was slower to recognize . Somehow  --  damned British arrogance ?  --  he had n't expected to find one here . Pillory and stocks were common punishment in the Colonial period , but a ducking stool ? Then he remembered that it had been used to rehabilitate shrews and nags as well as to test witches ; for some reason the recollection made him feel better . " Where 's the Iron Maiden ? " he asked facetiously ; and was decidedly taken aback when Volz bobbed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all there , the objects he had seen in the musty dungeons of Nuremberg and the Tower ofp119London  --  the rack , the boot , thumbscrews . They looked even worse set against the clean-painted walls of this sunny room than they had in the stone-walled grimness of the fortresses . Volz watched his face with ugly amusement . " Why so surprised ? This stuff goes back to the seventeenth century . That 's when the colony was founded . The boys brought along some little bits of home , that 's all . " " But I thought the colony was founded on the basis of religiousfreedom . " " Too much freedom , " said Volz , not so cryptically . " I can see you do n't know much history , Stewart . Thinking in terms of the Inquisition ? All this stuff was part of the normal interrogationprocess , for criminals of various kinds . Heresy and witchcraft were crimes , sure ; but we had our share of that here too , you know . Remember Salem ? " " Certainly . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a vicious belief . " " No , no . Just the most publicized . Look here . " He indicated a glass case in the center of the room . At first glance its contents were a refreshing change from the rusty horrors which filled the rest of the room . They were , for the most part , old books and documents . Peter 's attention was caught by the central exhibit , a badly executed but evocative drawing of a woman 's face . The features were uncannily familiar , from the pale thin mouth to the untidy gray hair ; but the style of the drawing dated its subject to a far earlier centurythan the one Miss Device now graced . Yet the contrast jogged that one hitherto elusive memory . Peter did n't need the identifying label to recall the affair , with all its ugly details . " Elizabeth Device , " he muttered . " Good God , of course ! The Lancashire Witches . Sixteen . . . thirty-something ? Old Demdike , the head witch of the coven , her real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , no . Do n't tell me  --  " " Oh , yes . " Volz gave a hoarse shout of laughter , and one of the vile gadgets caught the vibration and whispered rustily.  | " Our little lady is the last descendant of one of the most notorious families in the history of witchcraft . Funniest thing I ever heard of . Especially when . . . " He added a descriptionof Miss Device which , while probably accurate , was unquestionablydefamatory . Peter grinned unwillingly . Volz had a mind like a sewer , but he also had a gift for pungent description . " I did n't know any of the family emigrated , " he said , turning back to the glass case . " It was n't publicized , " Volz said dryly . " The boys  --  two brothers they were  --  denied the family . But they made the mistake of bringing along a gossipy aunt  --  that one  --  and it was n't long before the town found out . Those "  --  his nod indicated the moldering documents in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Peter studied the long wrinkled face and squinted eyes . Not a pretty face , no ; but still . . . " What did they do to her ? " " She died during the ducking procedure . Third time down . " " Drowned ? " " Probably a heart attack , from terror , " Volz said indifferently . " The men who handled the stool were experts ; they did n't want the suspects to drown . It must have frustrated the hell out of them when the old lady died on their hands . " He chuckled . Peter looked at him in distaste , and had a sudden , horrific vision of Volz 's stocky form clad in the doublet and ruff of the period he was talking about . Black doublet , of course , and cropped hair ; he 'd be a Puritan , and a great little prosecutor . Studying Volz 's pouting mouth and beady eyes , Peter amended the description . A witch pricker , that 's what he 'd have been , enjoying the shame of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking pins in strategic parts of their bodies . Volz was not completely insensitive ; his eyes narrowed at Peter 's unconcealed disgust , and he said , " Let me show you the Iron Maiden . It 's a particularly good one . "  | " No thanks . I 'm weak already , and I do n't want to spoil my appetite . " " Yes . Too bad about last night . " Volz 's eyes lingered pleasurablyon Peter 's sling . You little bastard , Peter thought . Aloud he said , " Someoneput Timmy up to that performance . Are n't you even slightly curious about who is corrupting your servants ? " " He might of thought of it himself . Who knows how these crazy people think ? " Peter gave him a sweet smile ; his accompanying thoughts were better not revealed . Whatever the mess going on in this town , Volz had to be part of it . He was n't even bothering any longer to conceal his hostility . " I did n't see your car in front , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift . " " Having a little trouble with the carburetor , left it at the garage . " Volz puffed out his chest . " Great exercise , walking . Be good for you . " " Mmm . " Peter said . He left Volz in rapt contemplation of the rack . At the corner of the next street he caught sight of the church steeple , and knew where he was . He also knew where he was going . To the gentry of Middleburg , only one of the town 's three garages was The Garage . Tom and Mack 's , not far from the hotel . Volz 's shiny Lincoln was parked in the lot , but there was no sign of Jackson . Peter found him in the alley behind the garage , having a cigarette with two young men about his own age . At the sight of Peter , the two boys simply melted away . Jackson stood his ground , tossing his cigarette butt to the ground , but his expression was sullen . " Got time for a cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonial Room ? " " Anywhere you say . " " Ai n't you scared you 'll get in bad with my boss ? " Peter , who was already exasperated by his most recent encounter with Volz , made a grimace . Jackson 's face did not relax.  | " Leave me alone , " he said . " I told you before , I 'm not stickingmy neck out . " " Jackson , why do n't you get the hell out of this town ? This is n't all the world , not even all the country . This place  --  " " Stinks . So how do I get out ? You gon na adopt me ? Listen , Stewart , you 're trouble . It was bad enough before , now you 've had the sign put on you . " Jackson 's voice dropped to a whisper . He glanced uneasily over his shoulder ; and Peter 's nerves tightened . The signs of fear , which would have been disturbing enough in an ordinary man , were unnerving comingfrom Jackson . " What sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also become lower . " I 've already said more than I should . For God 's sake . Stewart , I told you , you 're poison . Do you really want to drag me down too ? Then stick around ; that 's all you have to do to finish me , just  --  stick around . " There was only one possible answer to that agonized plea . Peter turned on his heel and walked away . On his way back to the hotel he stopped in several shops , to pick up odds and ends such as toothpaste , and a gift for his unenthusiastic hostess . The drugstore still retained its small town apothecary atmosphere ; as Peter stood brooding darkly over the brightly colored rows of toothpaste , the proprietor spoke from behind the counter . " Looking for something in particular , mister ? " " Just trying to make up my mind . " Peter selected a packageat random . " Is there any difference , really ? " " Not much . It 's kind of confusing , I guess , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the man said , " You must be the writer fella who 's staying at the Inn . English , ai n't you ? " Peter admitted the fact , and the man extended his hand . " Olivetti 's my name . " " Stewart . " " Oh . Then you ai n't related to that other young fella who used to come in here . English , too , he was . "  |p123Peter  pocketed his change . " Was ? " " Yep , he 's dead . Shot hisself . " " Shot . . . " Peter turned back . " Suicide ? " " Well , the coroner said it was a accident . " Olivetti leaned both elbows on the counter and prepared to enjoy himself . " But everybody knew he was n't the careless sort . Got mixed up with that female , old Stephan 's niece . She 's poison , she is . " Killed himself for love ? " Peter leaned his elbows on the counter too . When in Rome . . . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither . " " What kind was he ? " Peter asked . Olivetti turned and spat neatly into some invisible containerbehind the counter . A melodious echo sounded , but Peter was too absorbed in the conversation to appreciate this survival from America 's past . " Owed me fifty bucks , " Olivetti said briefly . " I was n't the only one , neither . You figure it . " A fussy old lady hobbled up , demanding advice , and Olivettiturned away , with an invitation to drop in any time . Peter left . There were , actually , several ways of " figuring it . " Peter considered them as he did his other errands . His conversations with the shop attendants were not so casual as they seemed , and the comments he heard interested him very much . The languishing lady who ran the flower shop rememberedKate 's dead lover as a " sweet boy , with the most sensitiveeyes " ; the grocer referred darkly to ruined village maidensand irate fathers ; the high school girl behind the counter in Woolworth 's had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you bet your sweet life , mister , you could n't forget a guy like that . " Loaded with parcels , an inappropriate bunch of red roses , and a mass of vital but indigested information , Peter headed hotelward . His room was neat and airless ; it was odd how even a few days of nonoccupancy could remove the lived-in look of ap124room . Peter collected his clothes and tossed them into his suitcase . Habit , born of years of transient lodgings , made him recheck all the drawers . He found it in the bureau , in the upper drawer , the same one in which he had found the crucifix . The meaning of this object was not so ambiguous . It was a doll . No , Peter thought ; the old word came , unsoughtand unwelcome , into his mind . A poppet . The old word , which sounded so cute and innocuous , and which had such a deadly significance . This was no crude clay image bristling with pins . It was a work of art , a miniature model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doll-sized sweater ; there were even little leather shoes on the feet . The features were modeledwith loving  --  no , scratch that word  --  with care . And  --  this was the detail that really got him  --  the shaggy cap of blond hair was not only a good imitation of his , it was his . Real hair . Peter picked the doll up . As he studied the features more carefully , a wry smile touched his face . Clever ; yes , clever as hell , but there was a hint of caricature which was reassuringlymalicious and , therefore , human . Was his nose really that long ? The eyes  --  he could n't judge them . They were covered with a narrow wisp of black cloth tied around the head like a blindfold . The miniature hands were bound together at the wrists . Peter weighed the image in his hand . It was n't very heavy . Just cloth , from the look of it , stuffed with cotton or some similar material . Except for the head . The intent was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No pins . If his memory served him correctly , they usually used pins . " They " being the witches and warlocks who fashioned littleimages of their enemies , using the principle of sympatheticmagic to give them the identity of the would-be victim , so that any indignity or harm perpetrated on the image would be suffered by the living man or woman . So , no pins . It was a warning  --  perhaps a threat  --  and ap125hindrance . The bound hands and blinded eyes  --  ignorance and impotence , that was what they had wished upon him . They , again . The doll certainly suggested one specific person . But if he had n't happened to pass the museum , by pure accident , he would n't have known about Miss Device 's pretty little hobby . Mrs. Adams , and the cult of Magna Mater ; Miss Device and her dolls ; Volz 's filthy mind and overt antagonism ; Timmy . . . How many of them were there ? Or had one person employeda variety of devices to incriminate the innocent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person in Middleburg besides himself had it , as they said , " in for " Kate More . Now he had got the sign , as Jackson put it . Why ? Did the unknown view him as an ally of Kate 's ? Possibly . The doll had not turned up until after the Timmy episode , in which he had openly supported Kate . On the other hand , he did n't know when the doll had been put in the drawer ; he had n't been in his room for several days . A complicated image like that one would take some little time to make . Another possibility was that he was interfering , somehow , with the unknown plotter 's purpose ; that his subversive activitiesagainst Kate had been observed , and disapproved of . But that did n't make sense , because the end result of the seriesof supernatural happenings , his own and the others , must be the same : the annihilation of Katharine More . Unless . . . unless the other person ( or persons ) wanted the same result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his unreceptive mind , and he considered it sourly . No use thinking about it ; he would have to do some more investigatingbefore he had enough data to work with . It was only one of a number of possibilities , after all . Peter shelved that idea for future consideration , and went on to his third possibility : that Kate Ross herself was the perpetratorof the other tricks , including the ones which had been aimed against him . So far as he knew , nothing had happenedwhich she could n't have engineered herself , from the phony nightmares to the involvement of Timmy . Why shep126should want to make herself look like a budding psychotic he did n't know . Again , there were a few possible explanations , but no proof . But that was the trouble with all his ideas : nobody , except himself , had any obvious motives . One thing was clear  --  and it was just about the only thing that was . He had to know more . Unknown quantities were always potentially dangerous ; in this case the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the doll and moved by a wild impulse , began to pluck at the string that bound the small hands . He felt a crazy reluctance to damage the image ; it took him some time to unwind the string without hurting the inanimatewrists . As he did so , something sharp pricked the ball of his finger . Maybe he 'd been wrong about the pins . . . . But when he located the almost invisible end of the sharp object , and pulled it out of the stuffed palm , it was not a pin . It was a fingernail clipping , curved and thin and pointed . His fingernail clipping , just as it was his hair  --  parts of himself , added to the image , which gave the sympathetic identification greater force . The last time he had performed that particular hygienic ceremony had been  --  here , at the hotel ? Or at Kate 's house ? He could n't remember . The hair must have come from the barbershop . Or had someone sneaked in while he was asleep , and raped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mental image of Miss Device scuttling into the masculine confines of Alfie 's Barber Shop and snatchinga lock of hair from under Alfie 's broom . His mind reeled . It would be difficult to imitate one of Miss Device 's dolls , but not impossible . The blind , helpless eyes bothered him . He plucked at the blindfold , but it did n't move . Sewn into place , perhaps . He turned the doll over to look , and his lips pursed in a silent whistle . Not just a hindrance ; a definite warning . On the back of the image was a tiny white patch ; the color made its shape quite distinct against the black fabric . It was in the shape of a heart , and it was sewn , or glued , slightly to the left of center , just under the shoulder blade . Symbolic , not anatomically accurate . But clear . The heartp127is just as easily reached from the back as from the front . Peter had the distinct impression that the symbolism was not that of a love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in his suitcase . He told himself , ironically , that he was getting quite attached to the thing  --  even if its nose was too long . He was n't quite willing to admit that he wanted to keep it safe  --  away from any sharp objects which just might be inserted into that target on its back.  |p128Peter  had lunch in town and got back to the house at a time when he knew half the inhabitants would be taking naps . Kate usually slept after lunch ; no wonder , with the disturbed nights she had been having . The Schmidts would be in the kitchen or in their room , and Tiphaine was probably out somewhere . At any rate , she would n't be looking for him in the library . Like the living room , it was definitely a man 's room , but not that of a man whose acquaintance Peter would have been keen on having . The deep leather armchairs and dark , heavy furniture were all right ; so were the fine oak paneling and the walls lined with books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embroidered cushions and soft hassocks scattered about ; and who in his right mind would want to live with those pictures ? Hans Baldung 's " Witches at the Sabbath " ; the Durer engraving of the four beefy females  --  whomight simply have been having a girlish chat , au naturel , if Peter had n't known the title of the picture ; a set of medieval woodcuts , crude in style and even cruder in subject , showing executions of various kinds  --  hanging , burning , the headsman 's block . . . Dear old Uncle Stephan , Peter thought , and turned his attention to the books.  |p129Magic  and witchcraft , sorcery and alchemy ; volumes in German and French and Arabic , scholarly works such as Murray and Frazer ; the classics , Reginald Scot and James I ; the screwballs , such as Montague Summers . It was the most complete collection of books on the occult Peter had ever seen ; fifteen years ago he would have rubbed his hands togetherand sailed in . Now he felt bored and slightly disgusted . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything he might need was here . He found a numberof references to the poppets , or dolls ; the idea of waxen images was old , very old , and distributed through many cultures . Sympathetic magic , according to Sir James Frazer . Used for love charms , ritual murder , even curing illness . And probably quite effective too , in a culture where people believed in its efficacy . But the books only confirmed his vague memories ; they told him nothing new . He put the History of Magic back on the shelf and went to the ornate mahogany desk that stood in front of the windows . A cursory investigation told him that he was wasting his time . Kate did n't work in this room ; none of her papers , scholarly or financial , were here . He could see her point . For want of anything better to do , he selected a book at random and sat down in a chair . It was a comfortable chair  --  almost too comfortable . It did n't feel like leather , but like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unpleasantlyreminded of a horror story he had once read about furniture which embraced its owner . He grimaced , and settledhimself firmly . Jolly old Uncle Stephan .. . Two hours later there were books all over the floor around the chair , and Peter was still reading . A watcher , if there had been one , might have deduced that he was not at all happy about what he was reading . Katharine remained invisible the rest of the day . She did n't appear for dinner , and Peter asked about her . " No , she 's all right , " Tiphaine said . " Just resting . She often has a tray in her room when she 's working , or just feelingantisocial. "  |p130They  served themselves , as was the household custom ; Mrs. Schmidt put a savory-smelling casserole and a salad in front of Tiphaine , and left the room . " Smells good , " Peter said , accepting a full plate . " Mrs. Schmidt is a marvelous cook , even if she is n't the most cheerful companion in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a tremendous difference in cooking . " " Parsley , sage , rosemary and thyme , " Peter murmured , pokingat the heap on his plate . " And savory , dill , basil and tarragon , " Tiphaine said mockingly . " They are used for just plain ordinary cooking , you know . Have some salad . Basil and dill in that . " Peter sampled the salad . " You 're right ; the woman 's a witch at cooking . " Tiphaine put her fork down and looked exasperated . " Peter , just for once , ca n't you  --  " " The subject seems to be on my mind . " " The trouble is you 're fighting it , " Tiphaine said shrewdly . " You do n't want to believe that things like that can happen . " " That 's probably true . Which is not very rational of me ; I know perfectly well that people do believe in the occult . What I ca n't understand is how a woman like Kate could fall for such rot . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was under an abnormal strain . Ordinarily I 'd have thought of blackmail , anonymous letters , the usual things . " " Anonymous letters ? " Tiphaine shrugged . " You do n't know Kate . Her reaction to a poison-pen letter would be a shout of laughter and a clinical analysis of the mental state of the writer . You 've heard people say that they do n't care what the rest of the world thinks . Mostly they 're lying . But Kate really does n't care . " Peter nodded . He was remembering Sam 's comment : " She takes a kind of pleasure in rubbing people 's noses in facts they do n't want to face . " " You mean she does whatever she pleases , and to hell with gossip . " " Not exactly , " Tiphaine said . " She does n't do things forp131the hell of it . But if she felt she had a good reason for behavingin a certain way , she would n't let gossip bother her . " " And that , " Peter pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so surprising . I agree ; she is n't susceptible to blackmail or threats for the ordinary peccadilloes that terrifymost people . But there 's a difference between fear of losingone 's reputation and fear of  --  death , shall we say ? " Tiphaine 's head jerked up . For a moment her face was unguarded , and Peter saw that the idea was not new to her . " Not necessarily death , " he went on . " But every human being has some weakness . Every one . Remember Nineteen Eighty-Four and Room One-oh-one . That was where they took the stubborn ones , the rebels whom nothing else could break . And the thing that waited for them in Room Oneoh-onewas simply the worst thing in the world . The one thing that they could n't endure . Different for every person ; but for every person there was something . What is it for Kate ? What one thing is it that she ca n't endure ? " " Loss ? " Tiphaine said softly ; chin propped on her hands , she had listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing too many folks songs , " Peter said rudely . " Cold blows the wind to my true love , And gently falls the rain . . . " She sang it , unselfconsciously , in an eerie little voice that was hardly more than a whisper . " It would be . . . funny . . . would n't it , if it were true . .. . " Funny is not precisely the word . " Peter did n't care for the look in her eyes . " Snap out of it , Tiphaine . Kate is no simpleminded romantic . How do you know she is n't inventingher apparitions ? " That idea was new to Tiphaine ; her eyes lost their vagueness . " Pretending , you mean ? " " She may not be doing it deliberately , " Peter conceded . " Deliberate or not , that 's not possible . I 've seen things myself , Peter . " " That does n't mean Kate could n't have engineered them . " " Oh , that 's absurd . Why on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know ? None of it makes any sense . It 's you I 'm worried about . If I could be sure you were in no danger .. . His hand slid up her bare arm . She was wearing something sleeveless and low-cut , of a pale ivory that set off her tan . After a moment Peter removed his hand . " Sorry again . " " Mrs. Schmidt will be bringing in the coffee at any moment , " she murmured . " Peter , I can tell ; you have something in mind . What is it ? " " Just a tentative scheme for catching the person who 's behind these tricks . If it turns out to be someone other than Kate , at least I 'll know that the malice is directed against her . I do n't mean to sound callous , but you 're my chief concern . " " That 's very sweet . " " Not so sweet , no . Look here . Sooner or later , some night , if not tonight , another incident will occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to act again , to destroy the confidence Timmy 's capture gave Kate . And I think he 'll act soon . " " Soon ? Then you think  --  " Peter drew his chair closer to hers . " Tonight . . . When Tiphaine came out of her cousin 's room Peter was waiting in the hall . She put her finger to her lips . " I slipped one of the pills Paul left into her tea . She 'll be asleep in minutes . " " Martin prescribed them ? " " Do you wonder ? She has a thing about drugs , that 's why I have to sneak . " Tiphaine grimaced . " I hate doing it , but  --  " " You have to . I know . Then you 're sure she wo n't be walkingaround anymore tonight ? " " Yes . " " Any luck with locking the doors onto the balcony ? " " No . I tried , but she told me to leave them open . She likes fresh air . "  |p133Peter  had been fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Never mind . I strung thread all over those bushes under the window . If anything goes up that way , we 'll know about it . Now for the inside of the house . Got the stuff ? " " I 'll get it . " Tiphaine went into her room and came back with a box of talcum . Peter sprinkled it lightly but thoroughlyover the hall carpet , beginning at Kate 's door . When the whiteness reached down to the door of the adjoining room , he stopped as if struck by a sudden thought . " My bathroom . Does n't it communicate with this room ? " " Yes . But what  --  " While she stood in the doorway watching , Peter crossed the spare room and slid the bolt into place . The white-headed pins and the plastic twine were completely invisible from where she stood , but she saw his ostentatious manipulation of the bolt . " Door 's bolted , " he said , coming back . " On this side . " " Right . What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , if anything untoward occurs . She 's suspicious of me , and if you 're not , you ought to be . " " What do you mean by that ? " " I mean you should n't trust anyone . " He finished sprinkling the hallway , leaving Tiphaine maroonedin her own doorway . She watched while he finished the job , backing into his own room like a painter who has painted himself into a corner . He waved the near-empty can of talcum cheerfully at Tiphaine , who responded with a faint smile . She closed her door , and Peter followed suit . Now no one could enter the hall without leaving traces in the even coating of powder . Peter react for an hour . Then he turned out his light and sat in the dark for another hour . By this time it was nearly 1 A.M. , and he decided it was safe to proceed . Most of his preparations were already made : the rumpled bed , the mechanism on the bathroom door , the chair under the doorknob of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shirt would be better camouflageagainst the pale facade of the house than dark clothing . He had already removed his shoes . He went to the door on the other side of the bathroom and took hold of the left-hand pair of threads . The plastic fishline was made for the job ; invisible against any surface , it was stronger than twine . He pulled slowly and steadily , and felt the bolt slide back . The adjoining room was dark , and he did n't dare turn on the light . A small pocket flashlight , gripped uncomfortably in his teeth , let him rearrange the device which controlled the bolt . He removed the pair of thumbtacks to the right of the bolt , and the length of fishline which had passed over them , from the head of the bolt , back through the crack between door and doorframe . He tested the tacks on the other side , and the piece of fishline which would shoot the bolt again after he got back into his room . Perfect . So far so good . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could . The wind was stronger than he realized . It tore at him as he moved crabwise along the window ledge and groped for a handhold among the tough vines to the left of the window . It was a cold wind . " Cold blows the wind . . . . " The plaintive little melody Tiphaine had sung began running through his head . " And gently falls the rain . . . . " No rain . Thank God for that , he could n't have tried this stunt in wet weather . He must appear at the strategicmoment looking as if he had just been summoned from a warm , dry bed . " I 've never had but one true love . . . . " He could n't get the tune out of his head . His toes jammed painfully into a crack in the stone , Peter fumbled for his next handhold . " Funny if it were true , " Tiphaine had said . The Unquiet Grave . No . . . not funny at all . His reverie ended when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really sticky part of the trip . The ivy was old and solidly entrenched ; it was like climbing a cargo net . But there was no ivy on the end of the house , near Kate 's balcony  |p135Clinging  like a chimpanzee to the drainpipe on the corner , Peter eyed the six-foot gap between his perch and the edge of the balcony . It was an easy jump , if there had been any solid ground from which to launch himself . He had seen the problem before , but there was n't really any sure solution to it . Getting to the balcony was n't so hard ; it was getting back that bothered him . Shinnying up the pipe a few feet , he hooked his heels into the space between wall and pipe and fell forward , arms extended and body straight . His hands caught the edge of the balcony with inches to spare , and in a moment he was climbing over the rail . What he saw brought him to a dead stop . There was a light inside the room . Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chill of the flooring , and swore under his breath . All his work was for nothing if she was still awake . Hell of a doctor Martin was ; he could n't even prescribe sleeping pills that worked . But when he peered through the curtains he framed a mental apology . She was asleep all right , and breathingheavily . But she had left a night light burning . He ought to have expected that . Holding the curtains slightly apart , he studied the situationbefore he ventured in . She was sleeping soundly now , but she had n't dropped off easily ; the bedclothes were twisted into knots and pushed down toward the bottom of the bed . She slept on her side , curled up protectively ; her arms were wrapped around the pillow which she held close to her , like a baby  --  or a shield . The nightgown was black lace this time . Clearly she was no sunbather . The tan on her legs faded above the knees . . . . Peter 's cold feet reminded him that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of a yell , that was the important thing . He slid into the room and got his secondsurprise when an object popped up from among the tumbledbedclothes . It was small , round , black , and had pointed ears , now pricked inquiringly . Peter and Pyewacket contemplated one another . The cat was curious but not perturbed . Peter glowered at it . He knewp136how unpredictably a sleeper 's sense of hearing functions ; people can snore through a parade of fire engines , and waken at a child 's whimper . The movement of the cat 's heavy body might be enough to rouse Kate . He went about his business as quickly as he could . By the time he had the arrangement set up , Pyewacket had n't moved . His ears were still pricked , though , and his head was cocked at an inquiring angle . Peter decided to risk one more delay . He had set up his display on top of the small desk which was conveniently close to the window . He wanted very much to see what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top center drawer , and a quick glance at the register of checks told him what he wanted to know . So she was impervious to blackmail , was she ? A series of sizable withdrawals , made out to cash , over the past nine or ten months , might be for some innocent purpose ; at the moment he could n't think of one . Ten thousandwas the highest amount , five thousand the least . They added up to a formidable sum . Peter put the checkbook back precisely as he had found it , and closed the drawer . Everything was set . But for the best effect , that light ought to be out . It was on the bedside table , within arms ' reach of the sleeper . A risky business , especially with that damned cat staring at him , ready to jump . But it had to be risked . If the suddendarkness , or a shriek from the cat , woke her  --  well , she had to wake up pretty soon anyhow . Peter started the tape recorder . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a whisper of noise . He crossed the room on tiptoe . Hand poised , he looked at Kate . She had n't moved . Sleep was n't knitting up any ravels for her ; the long dark lashes veiled the circles under her eyes , but there were two vertical lines between her brows , and the full mouth was drawn down at the corners . The lines in her forehead deepenedand she stirred , murmuring . Peter 's hand slammed down on the light switch , and the room went dark . He heard a rustle of bedclothes and an inquiring meow ; but by that time he was sliding through the window.  |p137He  had to make sure she was awake before he went any farther . The taped voice had begun , and grown louder ; the candles were due to burst into flame at any second . It would be better if she saw them light up . Crouching , peering through the slit in the curtains , he heard , over the muttering voice on the tape , the solid thud as Pyewacket hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noise . Still no movement from the sleeper . A paw , sheathed , but ready to erupt into claws at the slightestencouragement , patted hopefully at Peter 's fingers . He slid his other hand down the seductive , trusting slope of Pyewacket'sback , located the waving tail , and gave it a sharp tug . An anguished cry of trust betrayed rent the night , and Peter jerked his hand back just in time to avoid an incriminating set of scratches . He heard Kate sit up , so suddenly that the bed squealed . The candles chose that auspicious moment to light ; and he had one glimpse of an ashen face and staring black eyes before he went over the edge of the balcony . The recorded voice was loud enough now to drown the sounds of his movements , including , he hoped , the only loud noise he must make . The recording sounded good . The voices could n't be much alike , but the tormented whispering tone concealed differencesin timbre , and the accent was convincing . Good old Sam  --  always right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording that afternoon , in the seclusion of his bathroom , with the shower streaming , he had thought of Sam . Even the background rush of running water came through nicely . If you did n't know what it was , you 'd think it might be a wind howling eerily  --  or the crackle of flames , maybe . Poised on the outer edge of the balcony , Peter began his return trip . This was the only bad part . If that drainpipe was n't sturdy enough to bear the impact of his body , or if his hands missed its narrow circumference . . . He compensated for the second difficulty by letting himself fall parallel to the wall with his shoulder actually brushing it . The pipe sagged , but held ; grasping it with one hand , Peter pulled the stringp138wound around his waist and heard the series of tiny bumps as the recorder bounded onto the balcony , hit the rim , and came up over the rail . He reeled the string in as fast as he could , but the recorder swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ; he probably would n't need it again . With the tape recorder dangling from his belt like a scalp , Peter slithered across the side wall and in the window . He was moving fast , unbuttoning his shirt and unwinding string as he dashed across the spare room . Recorder , socks , and shirt went into the bathroom hamper . Time was getting on ; he could hear interesting sounds from the hall . His hand tugged gently on the remaining length of fishline ; an extra sharp tug , after the bolt was drawn , dislodged the thumbtack , and the twine 's full length came through the crack into his hand . Tugging. at his belt , Peter ran across the room , threw the chair aside , and opened the door . The hall was brightly lit ; Kate had turned on the switch outside her door . She was standing in the doorway , arms out and braced ; only their pressure on the doorframe held her erect , he could see the sag of her knees under the sheer black skirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer relief came over it as her eyes fell on Peter . Tiphaine , in her own doorway , had stopped to slip her arms into a robe . Following Peter 's instructions , she had not stepped onto the floor of the hall , where the white powder lay virgin and unmarked . " What happened ? " Peter asked , blinking . The light hurt his eyes ; it gave a fine air of verisimilitude to the picture he presented , that of a man abruptly awakened from peaceful slumbers , who has delayed answering the cries of the maiden in distress only long enough to assume his trousers . He finishedrebuckling his belt and stepped carefully out into the hall . Kate 's lips parted , but no sound came out . Tiphaine was studying the unmarked surface of the talcum . She looked up , caught Peter 's eye , and nodded ; and Peter made a dash forwardjust in time to catch Kate as she fell . She could n't weigh much more than a hundred pounds . The taut limbs , which looked so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of fragility now . Tiphaine was at his shoulder when he laid Kate down on her bed . He turned to her and repeated the question . " What happened ? " " I do n't know . I heard her call  --  look ! " She pointed . On the desk the twelve black candles burned , the flames flickering in the breeze from the window . There was an additionaleffect which Peter had n't planned : Pyewacket , fascinated by the dancing lights , sat like a black Egyptian statue between the candelabra , tail wound around his sleek flanks . But Tiphaine 's eyes were focused on the small object that lay before the cat , between the candlesticks . " Where did that come from ? " she asked breathlessly . " What is it ? " She walked to the desk , picked the object up , and held it out to Peter . " A rabbit 's foot . " She added , in a flat , even voice , " Mark carried one , as a lucky piece . Some uncle from America gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What happened to it ? " Peter took Kate 's hand and felt for a pulse . It was faint but steady ; she 'd be coming to in a minute . " It was  --  buried with him , I suppose . " " There are thousands of the things around . How do you know this was his ? " " I do n't . But  --  what point would there be to this unless it was  --  is  --  Mark 's ? " " Who knew about it ? " " Most everyone . He showed it to people . " She dropped the talisman back on the desk and rubbed her fingers together , shivering . " Get it out of sight , " Peter ordered . " And the candles . She 's coming around . You do n't want her to see that macabre arrangement again , do you ? " Tiphaine obeyed , but she moved so slowly that Kate 's eyes flickered open before she had finished clearing away . From her prone position Kate could look straight across the roomp140at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand he held tighten around his fingers . " The voice , " she muttered . " It was yours . Had to be . . yours . " Peter was silent , partly because it was a reasonable reaction , partly because he was struck momentarily speechless . Damn the woman ; what did it take to break her down , gibberingphosphorescent wraiths and skeletal fingers on her throat ? She had been frightened into a fainting fit , but that stubborn core of strength had led her straight to the only rational answer . Now he was glad that he had taken those seemingly unnecessary precautions . " You heard a voice ? " he said calmly . " In the darkness . . . the candles flared up . . . . A voice like . . . yours . " " It was n't Peter . " Tiphaine had swept the candles and rabbit'sfoot into the pocket of her robe . She came swiftly back to the bed , leaving a disappointed cat behind . " We sprinkled powder on the floor , Kate ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " " Connecting bath , " Kate muttered . Incongruously , through all her accusations , she retained her desperate grip on Peter 's hand . " It 's bolted . On this side . " " Go look . " Tiphaine gave Peter an expressive look and a shrug . She was back almost at once . " Still bolted . Kate , even if he got into the next room , how could he have reached yours ? Footprints would have shown in the hall ; he ca n't walk on the ceiling , you know . " Kate 's teeth began to chatter . The room was n't particularly cold . " That 's enough for now , " Peter said . " Tiphaine , you 'd bettercall  --  no , I 'll do it ; you stay with her . " He went out , flexing ostentatiously empty hands . Kate 's next thought would be for some sort of mechanical recording device ; she 'd insist that Tiphaine search the room . Just to be on the safe side , he 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit the doctor , would give him an opportunity , and it was logical that he would stop off in his own room to put on more clothes . With Katharine More you could n't take too many precautions . But as he closed the door gently behind him , he knew he had struck a damaging blow . The last thing he heard was her admission of defeat . " Then it was Mark . Mark 's voice . . . " Is she still pacing up there ? " " Yes . " Tiphaine was doing some pacing of her own ; she swung around on her heel , bright hair flying . " Martin says he ca n't give her anything more . Old maid , that 's what he is ! I think I 'll go out of my mind if she does n't stop ! " " She ought to get out of the house , " Peter said . " She wo n't go with me . " The strain was telling on the girl ; irritability sharpened her voice and flushed her cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I wish you luck . " Peter expected he would need it . He wanted to get Kate off by herself , preferably out of the house , where she could n't yell for help , but he did n't expect her to acquiesce . But Kate agreed without a struggle when he suggested a walk . Apparently Tiphaine 's report last night had cleared him . They went across the yard and through the gate into the woods , Kate leading , Peter trailing like a watchdog  --  or keeper , he thought . He did n't try to talk . She could n't keep up her present pace very long . After a while her steps slowed and stumbled ; but when Peter took her arm she shook his hand off . " I do n't need any help . " " Like hell you do n't , " Peter said unemphatically . She glanced up at him and then looked away . Her eyes were unfocused and dilated to blacker blackness than usual . " Let 's get off the path , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Lead the way . " " There 's a place I go to sometimes . " She pointed up thep142trail , to a spot where a coil of wickedly beautiful scarlet leaves twined around a tree , and a broken branch stuck out from a tall oak . Between the oak and the poison ivy a faint path went off into the underbrush , but Peter would not have seen it withoutguidance . Clearly it had not been used for some time ; honeysuckle and poison ivy made a thick treacherous mattingunderfoot , and climbed to strangle trees and bushes . Kate wriggled her way through and Peter ungallantly let her lead . He was scratched and perspiring by the time they broke through into a final tangle of thorned bushes into a small glade . A brook ran rippling across the cleared space and vanished between trees to the right . Tall trees ringed the clearing , shading it . Some pines ; the ground was covered with a thick soft carpet of browning needles , which had triumphed even over the omnipresent honeysuckle . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path by which they had come , stood an unusual object  --  a massive block of stone about ten feet high and almost as broad . Its color was dark , almost black ; granite , possibly . The top was flat , like a platform , but it bore no trace of man 's hand . " A meteorite ? " Peter hazarded . " No , just a chunk of rock . The local people call it the Devil 's Pulpit . " Kate crossed over to the rock and dropped down beside it . She fumbled in her pocket for her cigarettes . " They avoid this place , particularly around Halloween . That 's why I like to come here . " " Halloween ? " Peter sat down beside her and declined a cigarettewith a shake of his head . " Oh , yes , your local Allhallows . Jack-o ' - lanterns and  --  what is it ? Trick or treat . " " Have n't you ever seen it ? " " No . Sounds like a combination of Guy Fawkes and Car-nival . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be farms around here . " Kate propped herself on one elbow and stared absently at a shaft of sunlight jabbing clown through the trees . " The childrencame trick or treating to our place . Once . " " Once ? "  | " Uncle Stephan met them at the door , " Kate said dreamily . " I was there on a visit . He 'd worked awfully hard on his costume . When they rang the bell he answered it . They were dressed . . . oh , rabbits , and little witches , and Superman . He 'd painted his face dead white , except for his mouth . It was red . His canine teeth were particularly long and they shone in the dark . He made . . . noises . " Peter was silent . Comment was unnecessary . " Two of the fathers came next day , " she went on , in the same voice . " They did n't stay long . " She put her cigarette out very carefully , pinching the ends to make sure no spark remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground and hid her face in her arms . " Go ahead and cry , " Peter said gently . " It 'll do you good . " " I 'm not crying . " She rolled over onto her back and lay still , staring fixedly up at the blue circle of sky . " I 'm trying to think . Whether I should see a psychiatrist . Or move away from here . Or do what he wants . Or just kill myself and get it over with . " " That 's no solution , " Peter said . The moment he had been waiting for had arrived , and he did n't quite know what to do with it . " That 's what I 'm afraid of . " She gave a sudden dry laugh , like a stick snapping . " For in that sleep of death , what dreams may come . . . ' My dreams are bad enough now . That leaves three choices , does n't it ? " " Who , " Peter said , " is he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She rolled onto her side , looking at him through half-closed eyes . It took Peter several seconds to recognize the look , not because it was new to him , but because he had never expected it from her . Yet the pull was there , he had been aware of it for some time . She looked so much smaller when she was n't standing . He put out his hand and traced with his fingers the curve of her cheek and throat . Then her arms were around him , pulling him down . She lay on her back , eyes closed and face lifted , her armsp144lax and white against the brown pine needles . Peter propped himself up on one elbow and studied her face . It had n't changed . The tension was still there , tightening the corners of her mouth and hollowing her cheeks . Her sudden , unpremeditatedtry for temporary amnesia had n't worked . She had n't made any pretense about it ; no soft murmurings about love , only wordless sounds of pure physical pleasure . Still . . . even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an experience . " Want a cigarette ? " he asked . She shook her head without opening her eyes . " Help yourself . " Peter reached across for her shirt and felt in the pocket . His hand lingered on the return trip , and a faint smile curled her mouth , but she kept her eyes closed . . . . She must have felt the change in the pressure of his fingers , for her eyes flew open and she tried to sit up . Peter straightened his elbow , and she fell back . " You 're hurting me . . . . What is it ? What are you staring at ? " The signs were faint , but they could n't be missed . On a fair-skinned blonde like Tiphaine , maybe ; but Kate was dark . From a tree high above , a mocking bird sang a long trill . It sounded miles away . Peter shook his head dazedly . Of all the unexpected . . . How the hell had Sam ever missed this ? He felt her shrink under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet eyes wide with terror , and as easy to read as a page of print . " So it 's true , " he said stonily . " What happened to it ? " Her answer was barely audible , even in the dead silence . The bird had stopped singing . " She lived for eight months . It was pneumonia . " He knew then what need had driven her to the cult of Mother Earth , and the resurrection of the dead.  |p145Kate  knew she had betrayed herself with that one simple change of pronoun . Not only the fact , but what it had meant to her . . . . A chink in the armor , a break in the wall ; a weakness through which she could be attacked . She closed her eyes , wondering idly whether the hard hand would move up to her throat and tighten , and knowing that she did n't really care any longer . He had betrayed himself as well ; but she had always known , in some remote corner of her mind , who he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only in superficial features like the shape of their heads , and the unruly fair hair . Mark 's delicate nose and mouth and boyishly rounded face were nothing like Peter 's features . But when Peter 's eyes narrowed and his mouth went tight , she could see him  --  Mark  --  in one of his rages . Mark . . . one long year in his grave , and still haunting her , in no figurative sense . Against the blackness of her closed eyes the picture formed again , the same scene that had fought its way past her will on countless other days and nights . He always carried himself so arrogantly , walking on the balls of his feet with his head thrust forward . In the moonlight , that last night , he looked like one of Milton 's fallenp147angels  --  poised as if about to lift in flight , a thin diabolic smile on his youthful face . It was October , and cold  --  October , almost exactly one year ago  --  but Mark was coatless , and that , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conform to his requirements . When they did n't conform , he behaved as if they had . First she had tried to reason with him . It did n't work ; it never had . Then she had tried to hurt him . The stinging words had n't bothered Mark ; they bounced back off the barrierof his fantastic ego like tennis balls off a brick wall . He could n't believe any woman could resist him . But he had cause to think himself irresistible ; once she had responded to the boyish charm and the words which seemed so much wittier and less trite than conventional wooing . Witch woman he had called her , enchantress , weaving spells . . . . Succubus , that was one of his favorite endearments  --  the supernaturallybeautiful seductive spirit , preying on human lovers who can not resist her deadly charms . The epithets had palled even before Mark did ; that night , in the cold passionless light of the moon , they made her angry . Mark had tried every trick in his considerable repertoire : threats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was a quality beyond Mark 's comprehension . When all his devices failed , there was only one thing left . And somehowthe gun was in her hand , and he was coming toward her . . . . Katharine forced her eyes open . Peter was standing with his back to her , buttoning his shirt . The discarded sling lay on the ground at his feet . " Your arm , " she said dully . " I forgot about it . " " So did I. " Peter turned , with a smile that reminded her of an archaic statue 's  --  curved , remote , and terrible . " You 're very skillful . Practice , or natural talent ? " His eyes moved over her body with an inhuman contempt , and Kate snatched at her clothing . " Do n't , " she whispered . " Mark was something of a connoisseur . I 'm sure he appreciatedyou even more than I could . Until you tired of him . "  |p149Her  head bent , Kate began to dress . But she could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t must have been the final blow to him when he found out why you really wanted him . Not as a husband , not even as a lover . Just for breeding stock , like a healthy thoroughbreddog . Because it was n't carelessness , was it ? Not with a woman of your intelligence , not these days , when every gumchewingadolescent knows how to take precautions . That 's Ise only thing I find hard to believe : that a cold-blooded bitch like you could have one normal instinct . But then it is an instinct , is n't it  --  a matter of uncontrollable hormones . A sick , sentimental substitute for  --  " " Stop it ! " Kate clutched at her ears . He caught her by the elbows and forced her to face him . " What did you do to him ? What happened ? I 've always known it was n't an accident , Mark knew too much about guns . He killed himself , did n't he ? Did n't he ? And you drove him to it . " Shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him from under her loosened hair . " Killed himself ? " she gasped . " Himself ? Mark ? " She began to laugh . It surprised her . She had n't meant to laugh , and once she started she could n't stop . Through a haze of dreadful , shaking mirth she saw Peter 's face alter , saw his hand swing back ; and then the red haze faded into a lovely blackness , a cool blackness that swallowed up the laughter and the sting of the blow across her face , and all other sensation . She fell into a deep dark hole , embracing the blackness . Maybe , if she was clever and careful , she would never have to come out of it again . Martin 's voice brought her out of it , and she hated Martin . She hated the pressure of the bedclothes on her body and the familiar smell of fresh linen and the smooth feel of it on her cheek . All her reluctant senses fought at being awakened ; she curled herself up tighter inside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She hovered on the rim of the blackness . But the hateful voice would n't be still . " What the hell happened ? Goddamn it , do n't shake your head and look blank at me ; something must have happened , something cataclysmic ; she 's in a catatonic state , I ca n't even reach her . " " Let me try . " That voice . That one was worse . Kate hated it , it meant disaster ; but it jabbed and prodded like a needle , sliding in past defenses that kindlier voices could not pierce . " Kate , wake up . You ca n't hide , it does n't work . Kate . . . Answer me , Kate . . . . Oh , now  --  now she was feeling more  --  the hand on her shoulder , the bedsprings sagging as he sat down . Tears of fury welled up and slid down from under her stubbornly closed lids ; and Peter said , with a queer relief , " She 's crying . " Then it was nighttime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time had passed at all and the same voices had been talking without interruption . " Has n't she been asleep a long time ? " " The injection should be wearing off soon . But if she doeswithdraw again  --  well , you brought her out of it once . " " She did n't need me . She 'd have come out of it herself . " " She 's tough , yes , but everyone has his breaking point . " " Wise remark number forty-two . " " I have n't had an easy day myself , Stewart . " " Sorry . You 're quite fond of her , are n't you ? " " I wanted to marry her , " Martin said . Kate lay very still , her eyes closed ; with that vital sense cut off , it seemed as if the others were strengthened . She could almost feel Peter 's reaction , and Martin 's response to it . " I know , " Martin said , after a moment or two . " I already have a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What did prevent you ? " Peter asked pleasantly . " She was in love with someone else . " " So I 've heard . What was the fellow like ? " " Rather like you . Nothing specific ; but that first day , whenP151you came into my office , there was a look . . . . I think , " Martinadded , " that Kate 's seen it too . " Kate opened her eyes a slit . They stood at the foot of the bed , facing one another . Peter leaned wearily on the foothoard ; his hair looked as if he had been running both hands through it , and his face was haggard . Paul looked tired too . Poor Paul ; he had probably been working over her all day . " I do n't care what he looked like , " Peter said sharply . " What was he like ? " Martin took his time about answering . When he did , his comment was concise and his tone savage . " Treacherous , arrogant , selfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully . " Well , but he 's dead . Has been , for almost a year . Since conventional considerations do n't prevent you from  --  er  --  dreaming , why have n't you tried again ? " The smooth , sneering voice was so like Mark 's that Kate made a little movement of withdrawal . Neither man noticed . Martin stiffened and Peter straightened up . The air was electricwith antagonism . Kate pulled herself to a sitting position . " Stop it , " she said . " Paul , stop it , stop it , stop  --  " " It 's all right , Kate . " He was beside her at once , pushing her back onto the pillows . " Be quiet now , calm down . You do n't want another injection , do you ? " His hands were hard against her shoulders , and she was weaker than she had thought . " No , " she muttered ; all at once she felt as limp as a rag doll , as limp as a little wax figure held over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't want . . . that , " she said , with an enormous effort . " Want . . . I want . . . " What ? What is it you want ? " " My lawyer , " Kate said . " I want . . . make my will . " That was right , that was the right thing to say . She knew at once , from the heavenly feeling of lassitude that was beginning to fog her senses . Martin sat back , lifting his hands . He looked up to ex/change glances with Peter , who had come around to the side of the bed . " I thought you 'd made your will , " Martin said in a puzzled voice . Kate felt a sharp pang of anxiety . He was going to argue , he was n't going to do what she asked . " My lawyer , " she insisted . " Tomorrow . Promise , Paul . . . promise ... . " All right , all right , " Martin said . " I promise , Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do any harm , " he added , as if to himself ; but Kate knew he was speaking to Peter , who stood staring down at her with his brows drawn together in a frown . It did n't matter that he thought . She let out a long sigh . Paul would keep his promise . He always kept his promise . She was still a little weak next morning , but she insisted on getting up to meet the lawyer . Somehow that was important , that he should n't find her helpless in bed . Martin did n't argue . He was n't arguing about anything . Kate knew why he responded to her slightest suggestion with such suspicious alacrity , why he watched her when he thought she was n't looking . Deep down inside she laughed , and hugged herself with a secret joy . He did n't fool her . No , she was the one who was tricking them , all of them . The lawyer did n't seem to notice anything unusual when she rose to greet him , slim and poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this one . Her instructionswere simple and concise ; he nodded with grave approvalwhen she explained them . The only time he looked taken aback was when she asked him to have the will ready next day . Lawyers were like that , she told herself , and smiled tolerantly at him . They liked lots of time to quibble about nonessentials . " You said yourself it was quite straightforward , " she reminded him , and smiled her best smile . " I know it 's an imposition , but  --  as a favor to me ? " And because I 'm your richest client , she added silently . SheP153knew he would agree ; everything was going the way she wanted it to now . " Very well , Miss More . I 'll bring it out in the morning , since it 's so important to you . Is tomorrow an anniversary of some sort ? October  --  let me see , it will be the thirty-first . " He laughed . " Of course , the thirty-first , Halloween . " " Yes , " Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort . " For the rest of that day her feeling of dreamy contentment persisted . In some far-off corner of her mind Kate knew the mood would n't last ; people could n't live their whole lives feeling as if they were wrapped in invisible cotton which insulatedthem against the touch of the outside world . But the feeling was so pleasant , after the long months of tension , that she wanted to enjoy it as long as she could . Her new mood affected everyone in the house . Even Mrs. Schmidt was seen to smile as she carried in the tea tray . Tiphainewas brilliant , flushed , dancing . Martin relaxed so far as to go home in the early afternoon , announcing with a wry smile that he did , after all , have other patients . He took Kate aside to assure her that he would be back that night . The only person unaffected by the new regime was Peter Stewart . He kept out of sight , as if he expected a dismissal once his presence was noted ; but Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at windows . His expression was glum . In the afternoon it began to rain , and when the two women sat down to dinner , the patter of water against the windows sounded like thousands of little running feet . Martin had not yet returned , and Peter was also missing . Kate did n't ask about him . They made trivial conversation during dinner ; afterward they went into the living room . Kate picked up a book and Pyewacket came purring in and settled himself on her lap . His considerable bulk made reading difficult , since the owner of the favored lap had to keep elbows out at an odd angle to avoid jabbing the black back ; and tonight the cat seemedp154restless , never settling in one position but turning and rearranginghimself like a grumpy arthritic old man . Finally he sank his claws deliberately into Kate 's thigh , responded to her exclamation with a growl , and jumped down . He stood in the center of the floor , his long black tail waving like a whip , and then stalked off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him go with mingled amusement and irritation . His restlessness had affected her ; she could n't concentrate on her book . She turned her head to look at Tiphaine , who was draped over an armchair , feet dangling across the arm . Her pretty face was set in a frown of concentration and her hands moved in quick motions , manipulating a long piece of string . " More cats ' cradles ? " Kate asked . " That looks like a new one . " " Damn . " The string knotted and caught , and Tiphaine began to untangle it . " It 's new , and awfully complicated . I keep forgetting  --  There . " She put her hands inside the loop , stretching it wide , and began again . " Funny colored string , " Kate said lazily . " Just ordinary red twine . I found it in the kitchen drawer . It must have been on a package . You know how Mrs. Schmidt is about saving things . " Again the string caught . Tiphaine shook her head and tried a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really too sleepy to do anything useful ; even the patterned movement of the string , and the flash of Tiphaine 's white fingers , made her drowsy . " I think I 'll go to bed , " she said finally . " Listen to the rain . Sounds as if we 're in for a spell of bad weather . " " Ah . " Tiphaine made a soft sound of satisfaction and jerked her hands apart . The string slid and held , forming a pati , - rn too complex for Kate 's blinking eyes to see clearly ; there seemed to be a double set of seven strands raying out from the center . " No more rain , " Tiphaine announced with a grin . " I 've conjured up a wind . It should clear before morning . "  | " You mean you listened to the weather report , " Kate said , but the words lacked her usual snap , and Tiphaine looked at her intently . " You do look tired . Want me to come up and tuck you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit up much longer ? " " Not much longer . " " Good night , then . " Once upstairs , Kate found that she was no longer sleepy . Her bones ached with weariness , but after she was in bed , with the bed lamp turned down low , sleep would not come . That silly string game of Tiphaine 's obsessed her ; whenever she closed her eyes she seemed to see the pattern outlined in bright streaks of reddish light against blackness . After a period of restless tossing and turning  --  just like Pyewacket  --  she gave up , turned the lamp to a brighter setting , and reached for a book . She had read only a few pages when she heard footsteps in the hall . They were very soft , as if tiptoeing ; they sounded like a man 's step . Before she had time to become frightened , she remembered Martin . He had promised to come back and he always kept his promises . Probably he thought she was asleep and was tiptoeingin to look at her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile  --  a smile which froze as she recognizedPeter Stewart . He had been outside ; rain flattened his hair and darkened the shoulders of his coat . While Kate stared , he raised one finger to his lips in a gesture for silence . " I want to talk to you , " he said in a low voice . " I do n't want to talk to you , " Kate said childishly . " Go away . " His hand moved , so quickly that she had no chance to avoid it . The stiffened fingers struck her twice across the cheeks , sharp blows that stung the skin without rocking her head . She gasped and clawed at him with both hands . He caught her wrists and held them . The corners of his mouth lifted in a parody of a smile which was all the more unpleasant becausethe cold watchful eyes did not change.  | " That 's better , " he said . " You 've been in a fog all day . What are you taking , some sort of tranquilizer ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injection  --  " " Do n't let him give you any more . You 've had enough happy medicine . " He released her hands and sat down on the edge of the bed . " We never finished our conversation , did we ? " " We are n't going to finish it . Get out of here . Pack your things and get out of the house . " " Not until I 've found out what I came here for . " He leaned forward . " What happened to Mark ? " The name was a blow , a sharp jab with a heavy implement that jarred even through the thick cotton insulation , an insulationalready weakened by Peter 's presence . She shook her head . " No . It 's all over . I do n't have to talk about  --  him . " " It 's not over . Quite the contrary . " His hands reached out for her again , gripping her shoulders and pulling her up till their faces were only inches apart . Her treacherous body betrayedher ; she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands , her head fallen back . But she could not avoid his eyes . They held hers hypnotically . " But I did it , " she whispered . " I did what he told me to do . " " Who ? " The intent blue eyes widened . " Mark ? " She moved her head feebly . " Did . . . what he told me . Now he 'll leave me alone . " " Leave you . . . " His grip relaxed , and Kate fell back bonelesslyagainst the pillows . " Not an accident , " he said , as if to himself . " Not suicide . You killed him , did n't you ? " The words had been there so long , buried deep in her consciousness , but always beating against the barriers that held them in . " Yes , " she said , and her voice was suddenly strong and steady . " I killed him . " His eyelids flickered , but he showed no other reaction , except for the slow draining of color from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the door burst open , and Martin came into the room .   " I was afraid of this , " he said grimly . " Kate . What has he done to you ? " " Nothing , " Kate said vaguely . " I told him . About Mark . " " Good God , " Martin groaned . He turned on Peter , who had n't moved . His lids had drooped , hiding his eyes . His lashes were darker than his hair , and very thick ; Kate had noticed them on another occasion , and the memory of it must have shown in her face as she looked at him ; for Martin 's mouth tightened as he glanced from Peter to Kate . " Get out , Stewart . If you try to approach Kate again , I 'll call the police . " Peter stood up , stiffly . He did not speak , but when he raised his head and looked at Martin , the doctor stepped back . " Will ! " The handyman materialized in the open doorway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've made your point , " he said , and sauntered toward the door . Will stepped back to let him pass ; he left without another word or backward glance . " Make sure he leaves the house , " Martin ordered . He closed the door and came over to the bed , taking both Kate 's limp hands in his . " My poor darling . What have you done ? " Witchcraft or weather report , Tiphaine was right . Kate did n't hear the wind rise and howl around the house ; she was deep in drugged sleep . She woke next morning to a bright , cold world , as brilliantly polished as a jewel . She lay unmovingfor a few moments , trying to grasp the vague memory that made her uneasy ; then she recalled what had happened the night before . But the recollection was n't as painful as it might have been . Fatigue and the aftermath of shock had dulled her memories of the later part of the night , but she remembered Martin 's soft voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter 's word against hers . She could deny ever saying it . Confessions under duress were n't evidence . It was all right . Everything was all right . . . . Evidently Tiphaine had heard of Peter 's visit , for her ex/pression when she greeted Kate at the breakfast table was anxious . " Mr. Watts called , " she said tentatively . " He said he 'd be out at ten , if that was n't too early . I 'm to call him back if you  --  " " That 's fine , " Kate said . " Ten o'clock is fine . " She patted the younger girl 's cheek and saw her face brighten at this unusual demonstration of affection . At ten Mr. Watts duly appeared , and she signed the will . He had brought two of his clerks with him as witnesses . Common courtesy demanded that she offer him coffee , and she managed to conceal her annoyance when he accepted . Luckily he was too busy to linger long . By eleven he had left , and Kate went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair that she was caught unawares by the strength of the wind ; it swooped at her and sent her staggering . At the sound of the door being opened , Pyewacket came darting toward her like a black streak of lightning . His morning nap in the sun had proved too uncomfortable with the wind plucking at every hair . Naturally he blamed Kate for the weather ; he spat at her when she held the door for him . Kate walked around the side of the south wing , bending , over to pick up fallen branches which had been blown down by the wind . That must have been a real gale last night . She found the cold air refreshing ; it seemed to blow a few of the cobwebs from her brain . When she reached the kitchen door it opened and Tiphaine came out . She was wearing a bulky cable-knit sweater of offwhiteover her black slacks , and she carried Kate 's jacket . " Here you are . Out in this wind without a coat ? " " I was just about to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tiphaine held the jacket for her . " Want to beat me at archery ? " " I thought you hated it . " " I feel like doing something violent . " Tiphaine grinned and clutched at her hair . It was lifting straight up off her head , like a bright flame . " Come on , it 'll do you good . " " All right . But you wo n't even hit the target in this wind . " Her prediction proved to-be correct . Tiphaine had n't hadp159enough experience to allow for the wind , and her arrows sailed blithely in every direction . The girl was in one of her giddily cheerful moods this morning ; she laughed at each blunder . Kate shot with her usual methodical care , finding the challenge of the wild gusts interesting , and managed to get a reasonable number of black-and-red-feathered shafts into the inner circles of the target . On Tiphaine 's next turn the wind , which had been playing with her hair like a lover , wrapped the whole length of its ruddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide that Kate jumped back , even though she was standing , as prescribed , behind the archer . " That 's enough of that , " Tiphaine said , muffled . She unwoundherself and unstrung her bow . " I 'll shoot myself if I go on this way . Coming in , Kate ? " She had to repeat the question . Kate was staring off , across the lichened gray stones of the wall , toward the woods . The brilliant colors were beginning to fade now ; last night 's gale had stripped many of the remaining leaves from the trees . But the effect was still glorious , and it seemed to draw her . " What ? " she said . " No , I think maybe I 'll go for a walk . " " It 's almost lunchtime , " Tiphaine said . Kate turned to answer , and was just in time to see the look of calculation , quickly veiled , which had narrowed the girl 's eyes . " Maybe there is time for a walk , " she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I ca n't after lunch ; I promised Miss Device I 'd help her with some sewing . " " Let 's skip the walk , then , " Kate said casually . " I 'm getting hungry . " She waited until Tiphaine left for town before she got up from the chaise longue on which she had promised to nap . Looking out the window , she saw the car slow at the gate and then spin sharply to the right . She collected shoes , jacket , and a scarf for her hair , and went out . She found herself tiptoeing on the stairs and listening for sounds . There should be none ; Mrs. Schmidt would be busy in the kitchen , and Will always disappeared after lunch  --  for a nap , she suspected , though she had never caught him at it . And what difference did it make if anyone saw her ? She wasp160the mistress of the house ; she was going out for a little walk . Nevertheless , she was very careful in closing the heavy front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was outside . As she set out across the lawn she was almost running . She had to cross the stubble of Mr. Goldberg 's corn field to reach the wood from this direction . Walking was hard among the stiff short stalks , and she took care not to fall on any of them . Goldberg had planted a few vines of pumpkin along the edge ; the big orange globes looked like fallen moons , but not pretty golden moons  --  more like the swollen red monstersthat hang above a smoky horizon like goblin faces . Speaking of faces , the children had been busy among the pumpkins . Presumably they had carried the successful carvingsoff with them , but a few botched jack-o ' - lanterns lay among litters of seeds and pulp . One had been almost finished when the knife slipped , making a long , twisted gash of a mouth . Its big round eyes stared up at her , hollowed and empty with blackness . Kate shivered . The jolliness gone wrong , the sinister merriment , reminded her that Halloween had originally been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the powers of evil have strength to work their will . That 's the sort of thing we do here , she thought ; we try to hide horror with a painted clown 's mask . Our funerals , and embalming , and . . . She shook herself mentally and went on at a faster pace . Of all the morbid trains of thought . . . Once inside the woods she felt better , but even the familar , friendly terrain seemed changed . It was a wild wood , which had never been cleared ; she liked its tangled freedom , even when her ankles were scratched by shoots of wild holly and fir , and trapped by the ubiquitous honeysuckle . It was a bright , vivid place even in winter ; the orange berries of bittersweetstood out against the green of the pines , and blue jays and cardinals swung from graceful bare branches . There were always animals about , and she knew many of them personally ; hours spent sitting , in perfect stillness , on a fallen log or rock had accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was an old striped badger , who lived in a bankp161farther back in the woods , and a family of woodchucks , who trundled out to sun themselves on warm days . But today nothingseemed to be stirring . The woods were uncannily quiet . Once a jay shrieked , and the harsh note broke off in midcall , as if the sound of its own voice had frightened the bird . She was on the bridle path when she heard hoofbeats comingtoward her . The rider was still out of sight , and Kate looked about for a side path she could duck into . She did n't feel in the mood for people . Then the horse came into view . She recognized both horse and rider , and dashed toward the trees . In her haste she picked a spot where honeysuckle made an almost impenetrable curtain between two pines . Tearing at the resistant stems , Kate watched his handling of the horse and knew for certain what she had only suspected before . That fall of his had been a fake . He slid down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned her attempt at flight . Better to meet him here , in a semipublic place . He was dressed even more carelessly than usual , in a dark sweater and slacks which needed pressing ; above the black fabric his face looked bleached and spectral , the skin drawn tightly over the high cheekbones , the eyes faintly shadowed . " I tried to see you this morning , " he said . " They 've got the place too well guarded . " " Naturally . You realize that what I said last night  --  " " Forget about that . I 'm interested in this morning . Have you signed that will ? " Kate gaped , not knowing whether to be more surprised at his casual dismissal of her admission , or at his knowledge . " How did you know about the will ? I mean , that I was signing it this morning ? " " Snooping , " Peter said briefly . " Have you signed it ? " " Yes . " " Damn . " He ran his fingers through his hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crest . " It 's none of your business , anyhow , " Kate said , and tried to pass him . He caught her by the arms .   " I 'm not going to struggle with you , " she said distantly . " Nor argue , nor even talk . So you may as well let me go . " His fingers tightened and then relaxed , though he did not release her . " I 've been up most of the night , thinking , " he muttered . " But I suppose there 's nothing I could say to you , now , that would make you believe . . . Tell me something . You 've been paying blackmail . For Mark 's death , I suppose . To whom ? " In her numbed state , his shock tactics were very effective . " Timmy , " she said ; and her hand flew to her mouth as her eyes widened in horror . " Timmy again . Damn it all  --  you 've no idea who 's behind him , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you inherit them from Uncle Stephan too ? " " Yes . Damn you , damn you ! " She forgot her dignity , and her decision not to struggle , and began twisting frantically . " What are you trying to do ? Ca n't you leave me alone ? " " I wish to God I could . You 'd better not do that , " he added , his tight mouth relaxing a trifle , as she began pounding him on the chest with her clenched fists . " It 's not only undignified , but it has a bad effect on me . " He pulled her roughly into his arms , pinning her hands between his body and hers , and kissing her with an intensity that forced her head back into the curve of his shoulder . After the first second Kate forgot the discomfort of her twisted neck and laboring lungs ; she was not even aware of the moment when her body relaxed and her mouth answered the demand of his . He let her go so suddenly that she staggered , catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bite of them against her palms . Something rustled in the underbrush and Peter whirled , breathing hard . Silence fell ; and Peter 's clenched hands relaxed . " I 'm tempted , " he said , i . -a voice whose tone belied the mocking words , " to drag you up onto that horse and carry you off . But I would n't get far , would I ? "  |p163Kate  tried to say something , and found that her voice had deserted her . She shook her head violently . " No , " he agreed . " Not with you screaming bloody murder every step of the way . " Kate cleared her throat . " Anyhow , " she pointed out , " you have n't got a horse . " Peter swung around with a vehement remark . Sultan was still in sight , but retreating fast , one eye cocked warily . Peter started out after him . " I 'll be back , " he called out . " Try not to do anything stupid between now and six o'clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she had ever run in her life , ran till her legs ached and the pain in her side finally forced her to slow to a limping walk . The thing she was trying to run away from could n't be escaped so easily . It rode with her , step for step and yard for yard . She sank to the ground at the edge of the wood , in a tangle of arms and legs and disheveled hair . The wild wind hummed angrily in the trees above . Her brain felt as if it were boiling like a caldron . A hodgepodgeof mixed ideas , emotions , and fancies bubbled and seethed . One thought popped to the surface , and she was just beginning to see it clearly when it broke and sank , and anothertook its place . She sprawled in a heap of leaves , face hidden in her folded arms . As her frantic breathing slowed , so did the seething thoughts ; but the mental terrain that now lay open to her was as unfamiliar as a landscape after an earthquake has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How long she did not know , but when she finally sat up and opened her eyes , the sun was sinking westward and the shadows had grown longer . Out of the jumble of wild emotion one predominant feeling stood isolated and unshakable . She marveled that she had not recognized it long before . Only then did she hear the voice . It must have been callingfor some time ; it sounded hoarse and frantic . She looked up , and saw Tiphaine standing by the wall.  |p164She  must answer ; they would be worried about her . Unsteadilyshe got to her feet and waved . Tiphaine turned , saw her , and ran toward her . " Kate ! I 've been so worried . . . . What happened ? " " Nothing happened . I just  --  went for a walk . " " You look so . . . You saw him , did n't you ? " " Peter ? How did you know ? " Her voice was harsh ; the younger girl stepped back a pace . " Why  --  General Volz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if I planned to ride today . " " Oh . " Kate started walking toward the house . " What did he say ? " " Who ? " " Peter , of course . Kate , what 's wrong with you ? You look sort of drunk . " " It 's that stuff Paul gave me , I guess . " Kate stopped , turningtoward her cousin . She had to look up into Tiphaine 's face . " Tiphaine , I 've been thinking . We have n't had a vacationfor a long time . I think perhaps we ought to get away from here for a few weeks , maybe longer . " " A vacation ? " Tiphaine 's smooth face was expressionless . " Yes . Tomorrow we might go to one of the travel agencies , and collect some folders . Maybe even Europe . " " Tomorrow . " Tiphaine 's face cleared , and Kate felt sick with relief . It was going to be easier than she had thought . " That 's a wonderful idea , Kate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly got louder  --  a wild , rhythmic pounding , like drumbeats . Tiphaine understoodits meaning before Kate did ; she gasped , turning toward the trees , in time to see Sultan come thundering out into the open . The reins dangled loose on his neck , and the saddle was empty . Sultan shied violently at the sight of them , and swerved . Tiphaine ran toward him , calling ; he came to a crashing stop and stood with his head drooping . Kate followed more slowly . She was a poor horsewoman at best , and Sultan had always terrified her . Nor was she as quick as Tiphaine to catch the implications . Not until sheVwas standing beside her cousin ,  |p165and  caught a glimpse of Tiphaine 's face , did she realize what the empty saddle might mean . " He must have been thrown , " she exclaimed . " I guess so , " Tiphaine said slowly . " Or else he never did catch Sultan . " That idea was reassuring ; Kate snatched at it . " The brute was running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  oh , a long time ago  --  " " How long ago ? " " I do n't know . I do n't remember very well . " " Kate , you do n't know much about horses , do you ? Look at Sultan . " She knew that much ; she had been trying not to see it . Sultanthe vicious was in a state of pitiable terror . Shivering , sweating , nosing at Tiphaine 's hand , he did not look like a mount which has triumphantly tossed its rider and run for home . He had n't gone home . He had bolted , blindly and madly , and by the look of him he had been running for some time . Kate 's knees went weak . She put one hand on the saddle for support , and jerked it away as something warm and sticky smeared her fingers . In silence she held her hand out for inspection . Across the palm there was a wet reddish streak . Tiphaine said something . Kate did n't hear the words , only a buzzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head , echoing hollowly , words had begun to form : an insanelitany that beat in time with the cold , rushing wind 's moan . " Cold blows the wind . . . cold blows the wind . . . . Somehow she got into the saddle . The stirrups were too long , and she could n't seem to get her feet into them . She slammed her heels into the horse 's sides . Tiphaine 's hands pulled at her . She shook them off and snatched at the rough mane as Sultan bolted . Under any other circumstances she could never have controlledSultan . He was too big and too strong-mouthed . Now he was no longer an animal ; he was simply a means of locomotion , and the will that drove her mastered him . Sultan took the main trail at a dead run . They met no one.  |p166The  woods were as still as death , shadowy under the tall pines . When they neared the turnoff to the glade , the horse stopped so suddenly that only Kate 's taut grip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did not need the animal 's signs of panic to tell her the way . A horse had been through the cutoff , though it had not been intended as a bridle trail . The hoof marks were clear on the bare patches of ground off the hard surface of the main trail . She forced Sultan onto the cutoff , but it took all her will to do it , and that will was fading , with the fear of what she knew she would find . At the edge of the glade he balked , planting all four feet like rocks . He would go no farther . Katharine , perched precariously on his back , felt the shivering muscles under her thighs like an extension of her own shakingbody . The clearing was carpeted with gypsy-colored leaves , but enough foliage still remained on the trees to cut out the sunlightand cast a blue haze over the scene before her . In the shadows the man 's body lay face down and utterly still , lookingtwo-dimensional , like a figure cut out of black paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gilding the tumbledfair hair . Its oblique path caught the tip of the arrow that stood up from his back like a little banner . The feathers were black and red . In Kate 's ears the old song rang with a sick , hollow whine , like a bad recording : " And he in greenwood now lies slain . "  |p167The  trees turned upside down , trunks up and branches toward her feet . Kate slid off the horse 's back , landing on hands and knees . Standing erect was out of the question . She crawled across the few feet that separated her from Peter . For a long minute she knelt there , hands on her knees , watching gravely as the tip of the arrow bobbed up and down and the trees swayed in a slow , sickening dance . It took her that long  --  sixty interminableseconds  --  to realize that the two movements were not the same . The feathers were moving , minutely but perceptibly , with the rhythm of his breathing . She put out a shaking hand to touch his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more vigorously . " Do n't move , " she said , in a voice which sounded too steady to be her own . " You 've got an arrow sticking in you . " There was a long moment of silence , while she sat listening to Peter 's breathing . It was emphatic and irregular now , punctuatedwith more peremptory sounds of life . Finally a muffledvoice said , " What was that you said ? " " An arrow . In your back . " " Oh . " He turned his head carefully , without lifting it , andp168Kate found herself staring into one half-closed blue eye . The eye narrowed still more as recognition dawned . " Arrow , " he repeated , as if the word were too incredible to believe . " One of yours , by any chance ? " " Yes , it 's one of mine . " She lifted both hands and let them fall , in a gesture of denial . " But I did n't do it . Probably you wo n't believe me . " Peter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sultan came back alone . There was blood on the saddle . " " Is n't that the title of a song ? " The silence went on so long that she bent over him in a new upsurge of terror , and his eye opened again . This time it looked more alert . " Pull it out . " " Peter , I dare n't . I 'll go for Paul . He 'll know  --  " Peter levered himself up on one elbow . " If you did n't fire the bloody thing , someone else did . I 'd rather not wait around until he comes back to dispose of the remains . " His eyes narrowed as he studied her pale face and silently working mouth ; then the corners of his mouth curled up in the familiar , detestable smile . " Chicken ? " he inquired gently . Kate took a deep breath . " Brace yourself , " she said , and grasped the shaft , as close to the point as she could . It had not penetrated as deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had thought ; he was flat on his face and squirming by the time she had finished . She took advantage of his position to apply a wadded-up handkerchief to the wound , and then held the evidence in front of the face he had turned toward her . " Hunting arrow , " he muttered . " I never use them . " " I know . Drop it , we sha n't learn anything from it . Everyonein town must know your colors . Let 's make ourselves scarce . " " Can you walk ? "  | " I 'll crawl if I must , " he said grimly , and pushed himself to his knees . " I have Sultan . If you can mount . . . They managed it somehow , though it was n't easy ; by the time Peter was in the saddle , clutching the pommel with both hands and swaying ominously , there was a sizable wet patch on the back of his sweater . Katharine took the reins and they started off . Sultan was unhappy , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter 's breath catch every time a hoof came down . " Hold on , " she said , without looking at him . " If you fall off , I 'll never get you back up there . " " I 'll hold on . " " Peter . What were you doing out there ? head . When they turned onto the bridle path the going was easier , and again Kate found time to wonder at the unnatural stillness of the woods . The shady , sun-streaked leaves seemed frozen , as if waiting . Only the creak of the saddle and the slow rhythmic plop of the horse 's hooves broke the stillness . She turned to look at Peter , and saw that he had slumped forward till his head touched Sultan 's neck . Her hand loosened its hold , and Sultan stopped . Peter straightened , blinking . " What 's up ? " " I 'd better walk beside you , its safer . " She slapped the horse 's flank . " Come on , you nasty brute , walk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " To the house , I guess . Then I 'd better  --  " " Got to talk first , " he interrupted . " Ca n't wait . You know ... what ... She interrupted in turn , trying to spare him the effort of talking . " I know someone just tried to kill you . From the questions you asked me earlier , I gather you 've been snooping , as you put it , into the various unpleasant things that have been happening to me . I 'm assuming , as a working hypothesis , that thep170would-be murderer is the person who 's been blackmailing me . You think the Schmidts may be involved . It 's certainly a possibility . There are a lot of other things I do n't understand ; I do n't know why a blackmailer would want to  --  try to drive me out of my mind . People who 've been judged insane ca n't sign checks . And I do n't know why you . . . why you . . . Peter was sitting up straighter and looking more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unvoiced question , nor on the faltering of her voice . " What a pleasure it is to meet someone with a logical mind , " he murmured . " That 's fine , as far as it goes . But you do n't understand the really vital part yet . And I doubt if I could explain it . I 'm not even sure I believe it myself . Do you know what today is ? " " Why  --  October thirty-first . What about it ? " Peter 's eyes rolled expressively heavenward . " Think , Kate , think . It 's all there , if you 'll just face it . Common garden-variety murderers do n't use bow and arrow . In a forest glade , Kate , with a black stone and a babbling brook  --  in the greenwood , as the poet says . And the date  --  ah , I see you have thought of it . " The blue eyes met the black in a long , demanding stare ; Kate 's eyes were the first to fall . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sultan , sensing her agitation , stamped and snorted ; and Peter exclaimed aloud and caught at his shoulder . " Hurry , " he said through clenched teeth . " We mus n't be here after the sun sets . " The sun had set before they reached the house . Behind the skeletal trees to the west the sunset flamed in angry hues of red and orange , scarred by slashes of purple and black clouds . The house swam in the dimness of twilight . There was no light , no sound , and no sign of a living occupant . Kate , supporting most of Peter 's sagging weight , let her held breath out in a sigh of relief . She had n't wanted to come back here , but there was literally nowhere else to go . Volz 's was the only nearby house , and Volz , of all people . . . ButP171the Schmidts seemed to be gone ; at least they had n't heard her come in . But they might come looking for her at any moment , finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conscious , but just barely ; she could n't drag him much farther , certainly not up the stairs . She stood undecided in the dim hall , biting her lip nervously . Would it be better to get him into her car and head straight for town ? The car was out in back , and if the Schmidts were in the kitchen , they would hear the engine start up . No , there was a quicker way to get help . She maneuveredher burden into the living room and let him drop onto the sofa . He moved feebly , and fell back ; and Kate , rubbingaching shoulders , tiptoed out into the hall to the telephone . Martin responded instantly , as she had known he would ; no surprise , no questions , no delay . Only a few terse instructions and a promise to come at once . Luckily the capsules were in the medicine chest in the downstairs bathroom . Martin had prescribed them for her headaches , but she had never used them  --  that silly phobia of hers about drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need and fled for the living room , closing the door behind her with an absurd sense that she had reached sanctuary . There was no reason to be afraid now ; even if her wildest fears were true , even if they found her , help was on the way . Peter was trying to sit up when she came in , and he resisted her attempts to get him down again . " Too dangerous , " he muttered . " Kate . . . got to talk . I 'm so damned dizzy . . . . " Take these . " She offered him the pills , three of them , and a glass of water . " What . . . ? " " They 're for pain . Like aspirin , only stronger . " He was too confused to argue . The pills went down , but Peter refused the water . " Got any brandy ? " " Maybe you should n't . " " I 'll risk it . Need something . . . quick . " P172He swallowed it in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sat up , shaking his head . " Wow . That 's better . I 'll need more patching up , I 'm afraid , but make it quick . We 'll talk while you work . " " Try not to yell , " Kate warned as he lay flat , chin supported on his folded arms . " I do n't want anyone to know we 're here . " " 1 'm too tired to yell . You think the Schmidts are involved , then ? " " 1 do n't know . That 's just the trouble . I feel I ca n't trust anyone . " " Best possible assumption . That 's what we have to talk about . I have an idea that  --  ouch ! What are you putting on that , carbolic acid ? " " Peroxide . Are you all right ? " There was a lengthy pause before Peter replied . " I 'm so sleepy . What was I talking about ? " " I told you not to take that brandy . Hold still . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too steady . It was hard to see , the twilight was so far advanced . But she did n't dare turn on a light . Her ears strained to hear the sound she hoped for , the familiar rattle and clank of the old car . But the windows were closed ; maybe she would n't hear the car . He could get in . The front door was unlocked . Peter was so still she feared he had fainted under her awkwardhands . The room seemed very dark . And cold . Peter had begun to shiver . She remembered the danger of shock , and squinted into the gloom , trying to find something to put over him . But she knew there was nothing of that sort in the room , not even an afghan . " Peter . Peter , can you hear me ? " A vague murmur was the only response . " Peter ! I 've got to go upstairs and get something , a blanket , or  --  " He sat bolt upright , in one convulsive movement . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . This was crazy , coming here . . . . I 've just realized . . . they 'll be looking for us , it 's dark now , and this is the logical place . After dark . . . before midnight . . .  |p173His  voice dropped to a mumble , and Kate peered anxiously at the pale oval of his face . " Peter , lie down . You 're sick . You do n't know what you 're saying . " " Got to get out of here , " Peter insisted querulously . " May not know we 're here . . . yet . . . but they 'll wait . Out there . Go out the window . Around the side to the car . . . " It 's all right , Peter . Paul will be here any minute . I called him as soon as we arrived , and he said  --  " His hands caught her by the shoulders , sinking painfully into the old bruises . " You did what ? " " Called the doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so suddenly that she fell to one side ; then he slumped forward , hands buried in his hair . " God Almighty . I 've got to think . . . . What the hell is wrong with me ? Maybe it 's not too late . The window . " " Oh , no , Peter . Not  --  " " You are hard to convince , are n't you ? Too damned trusting , that 's your trouble . . . . Said it yourself , do n't trust anybody . " Peter pushed himself upright and stood swaying drunkenly . " Do n't wait for me . Run . Maybe . . . not too late . . . . " I 'm afraid it is , " Martin said regretfully . The overhead chandelier went on , in a blinding burst of light , and somehow Kate found herself in Peter 's arms , not quite sure who was supporting whom , but illogically reassured by the feel of him . From under blinking eyelids she saw Martinin the doorway , smiling pleasantly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an attractive couple . It really is a pity . " " You do n't have to kill her , " Peter mumbled . " She 'll agree  --  " " Too late for that , too . If she 'd agreed to marry me . . . But I knew the other day , when I heard her disgusting babblingabout you , that I had n't a chance . " " Then it was n't you who suggested . . . " Peter shook his head . " I ca n't think , " he said plaintively.  | " I see you 've taken your medicine , " Martin said with a smile . " But you suspected me , earlier ; I overheard what you were saying before I came in . Where did I go wrong ? I thought I was doing a magnificent job of being the stalwart , loyal family doctor . " " The will . " " Not until then ? Well , that is a relief . But I do n't think anyone else will find it peculiar . Even the lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her money to her sole surviving relative . " " Wo n't be so reasonable . . . if she dies , " Peter muttered . " Oh , it will seem quite reasonable . You do n't know the rest of the plan yet . But you soon will . Come along , both of you . " Now that the first shock of his appearance had worn off , Kate was trying desperately to think . The Schmidts were involved , then ; they must be , or Martin would n't be so confidentof his control of the situation . But he had n't called them . He did n't even have a weapon . He thought he could easily handle a woman and a man weakened by  --  drugs , of course . Those pills ! Kate 's knees buckled under Peter 's weight , and as his head dropped onto her shoulder she gasped , " You 've killed him ! What was in those capsules ? " " He 's not dead , he 's just sleeping peacefully . So much kinder that way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still stubbornly clutching at Peter . He was a dead weight ; but as they went down she felt his elbow dig into her ribs , and she threw herself into her part with abandon , wringing her hands as she bent over him . " He 's dead , he 's dead ; you 've killed him ! " She slid back out of the way as Martin knelt to inspect his victim ; and Peter 's legs came up , knees bent . But his reflexes were dulled by the drug ; Martin saw the blow coming , and ducked . Instead of hitting his head , Peter 's knees struck his shoulder and sent him sprawling . Peter got to his feet , teeth set in his lower lip ; and as Kate sprang toward him he spun her around , put his hands in the middle of her back , and shoved.  |p175She  went staggering toward the window , knowing she could n't stop herself . . . . Then her outflung hands struck the panel and the door leaves burst open . Kate went reeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sham balconies in the other rooms , being wider , longer , and railed with stone . Kate hit the balustrade with a force that knocked the breath out of her . Clinging to the cold stone with both hands , she looked back over her shoulder . Framed by the window , under the glaring lights , the interior of the room looked unreal , like a set in a play . Peter was down , and decidedly out ; there was no pretense this time about his twisted limbs and head . He had used the last of his strength to give her a chance of escape . And not only her  --  his only hope of survival lay in her being able to get help . If she was caught , they were both lost . The logic was inescapable . The only trouble was , Kate could n't move . She could n't run away and leave him . It was stupid , it was illogical ; but for the moment primitive instinct was stronger than reason , and it froze her in her place . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a queer choking noise , Kate flexed her knees and jumped over the edge of the balcony . She landed with a thud in a big yew , scratching her arms and face and doing considerable damage to one ankle ; but now that the decision had been made , she no longer hesitated . Martin ran out onto the balcony , and she crawled , underthe shelter of the yew , toward the corner of the house . Before he could get over the balustrade she broke free , runningas fast as she could toward the front of the house . He reacted as she had hoped . By going through the house and out the front door , he could intercept her on the route she appeared to be taking  --  from the house to the front gate . As soon as he disappeared into the room , Kate turned . She was heading for the car , and she was prepared to take some risks in order to acquire a speedy means of transportation ; but some rudiments of caution remained , enough top176make her stop before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as well she did so . The car was there , all right ; she could see its outlines through the branches of the shrub behindwhich she cowered . She could also see Will Schmidt . The hood of the car was up , and he was bending over the engine . Kate gritted her teeth . Damn Martin ; he would think of that . When Schmidt straightened and turned , in response to a hail from the front of the house , she knew the car was useless to her . It would take too long to find out what part Will had gimmicked . Perhaps it was n't even repairable . Schmidt carefully lowered the hood before setting off at an ungainly lope to join his confederate . Kate grinned savagely . If she had n't seen him at work , she might have wasted vital moments trying to start the engine . Instead of backtracking , she slid around the corner of the house in the same direction Schmidt had taken , but at an angle , avoiding the car . As she ran , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have left Peter alone . If she could rouse him . . . But the idea was absurd . He was deep in drugged sleep , and too weak to go fast and quietly even if she could waken him . She turned her mind instead to alternatemeans of transportation . It was miles to town , it would take too long to walk , and they would be searching for her . They . . . She had never realized the terror that could be implicit in a simple pronoun . She did n't know who they were , nor how many they were . All she knew was their purpose . But that was enough . So it would have to be the woods , and Volz 's stables . Sultan had gone home a long time ago , she had been too much preoccupied with more important matters to tie him , and he was not the horse to linger when bed and breakfast beckoned . Volz might be one of them ; he was a horrible man anyhow , and she did n't dare ask him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own room at sunset . . . . Timmy . Kate set her teeth and ran faster . Timmy had always made her skin crawl , even before the recent events in which he hadp177been so oddly involved . But in her present mood she was prepared to deal with Timmy , or anyone else near her own size . It might be just as well , though , to take some precautions . She slowed to a walk , forced to do so by the pain in her straining lungs , and put the delay to good use by scanning the shadowy sides of the path . A stout stick and  --  yes , there was a stone just the right size , small enough to fit comfortably into her fist , big enough to hurt . She would just have to hit Timmy if he tried to get between her and one of Volz 's horses . Or Volz 's car ? No . The keys would n't be in the ignition , they would be in Hilary 's pocket , and Hilary would be shut in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid and comfort to anyone . Besides , the car made too much noise . She stumbled as her weakened ankle gave way , and fell head first against a tree trunk , hitting her forehead so hard that for an instant she saw bright lights whirling inside her eyeballs . With a whimper of pain she ran on . The lights were n't as bad as the other things she kept seeing inside her eyes , the visions of what they might be doing to Peter . When she reached the edge of the woods she stopped , rubbingher aching head . Her vision was blurred , and she had to blink before it cleared . What she saw made her stomach sink , sickeningly . The moonlight shone off the polished surfaces of a number of cars parked outside the stable gates , and most of the downstairs lights were blazing . Tonight , of all nights , Volz was entertaining . Kate slumped against a tree trunk , sick with despair . She could n't go out there when the house was full of people and the chauffeurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was someone in the town , someone among the owners of those cars , to whom she could appeal for aid ? She looked again , and gradually she realized that there was something strange about the cars . The weird outlines of Miss Device 's old electric runabout were unmistakable . She was one of the sights of the town in that car , sitting bolt uprighton the high seat . Miss Device would not be much of an ally . She would twitter and wring her hands.  |p178Miss  Device always drove herself . But the others . . . Joan Solomon did too , her white Cadillac was in the lot , parked at Joan 's usual , acute angle next to the Senator 's Rolls . The Senator had a chauffeur . Where was he ? A cold wind put chilly fingers down her spine , and she knew the answer . In nice weather the chauffeurs hung around outside . On a night like this , with a long party in prospect , they would be in the kitchen , or with Hilary in his room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would be inside . Kate straightened , her hopes rising . Maybe the situation was n't so hopeless . She would just have to be careful . But no cars . Joan had probably left her keys . She had lost two cars that way , but she still forgot the keys . But Joan 's Cadillac was too hard to get at , through the tangle of surrounding fenders . The stableyard gates were closed , as they always were at night . Kate sighed . Another wall to climb . At least this was wooden , and slatted , instead of crumbling stone . When she was inside the yard she unbarred the gate to facilitate her retreat . Then she crept toward the stalls . She had already decided which horse to take . Not Sultan . She would have to ride bareback ; saddling up would take too much time . The little mare Starlight was the gentlest of Volz 's horses . But with Starlight Kate knew she had to get out of the yard unseen and unsuspected . Sultan could outrun the mare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the others , especially with skilled horsemen on their backs . Her skin crawling in spite of her resolve , she inspected all the stalls to make sure Timmy was n't napping in one of them . Sometimes he did . But he had a catlike regard for his own comfort  --  or what he considered comfort , which did not includecleanliness . She was relieved , but not surprised , to find no trace of him . In the silent stableyard , the only sounds came from the horses . Kate jumped as something touched her ankle and then relaxed when she recognized Grimalkin , the stable cat , twin/ing himself around her ankles . He was normally an unsociable animal , but he liked her . Kate stooped to touch his fur , thinkingwryly that in this town a cat 's approval was not necessarily a compliment . Her presence acknowledged , the cat stalked off , tail high , and Kate reached in to unlatch Starlight 's stall door . The mare turned her head with a little inquiring sound , and Kate grabbed for her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intruder ; she was not alarmed , because nothing alarmed her . Her placid disposition was the reason why Kate had chosen her . Then the shadows moved . Kate spun around . Timmy stood in the doorway . His face was a featureless darkness , but she recognized the slight figure outlined against the pale moonlight . She took in a breath which was almost a gasp . The first sight of him had had the effect of a blow in the pit of the stomach . But the stone was in her left-hand pocket . The stick was clenched in her right hand . " Get out of the way , Timmy , " she said softly . " Go back to your own room . " Timmy 's shadowy head moved from side to side . His slim body did n't really block the doorway ; she could see the cobblesof the courtyard on either side of him . She raised her stick . " Go back . Or I 'll tell Mr. Volz on you . " Timmy 's head jerked back , and for a moment she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft sounds he was making , and recognized diem for what they were ; and for a second another fear , the fear of the normal for the stain of madness , gripped her throat . It was then that she saw the others moving slowly in from behind and from both sides . Bizarre , nightmare shapes : a wolf , man-tall , walking on its hind legs ; a woman in long black skirts and a stiff white cap that concealed her features as completely as the wolf-snout hid the other face ; a crouching dark shape with a ghoul 's face that had run like melted lava and shone with a sick green luminescence ; a wrinkled harridan with long gray locksp180streaming under a pointed hat , carrying a broom . . . . A witch , like the witch costume the little girl had worn that night , so long ago . . . Halloween night . Costume . . . Kate 's reeling brain swayed back from the edge of hysteria . It was Halloween , and Volz was giving a costume party . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar faces , many of which she had known all her life . Miss Device , dressed like her long-dead ancestress ; Mrs. Adams , the witch ; Joan Solomon , in a dirty torn shift that showed far too much of her ample figure . There were leaves , dark ugly leaves , twisted in her hair . And foremost among them was General Volz himself , dressed in the tall hat and white ruff and buckled shoes worn by the Salem judges . He was smiling . " We were pretty sure you 'd head for here , " he said . They were all smiling . Familiar faces , looking as she had never seen them look . . . . Her mind made the final , mad connection , and without conscious thought she began to count . Seven , eight , nine . Nine of them . And the others , the four others  --  that made . . . " Thirteen , " she said aloud ; and Volz , following her reasoningwith an ease that was the final confirmation , nodded his bullet head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the proper number . Is n't it , Dr. More ? "  |p181They  tied her hands and feet , since Volz was driving alone , but they did n't bother to gag her . Kate knew why . The hired chauffeurs had been left at home tonight ; but if they had been here , or if Hilary heard her cry out , no one would answer . On Allhallow 's Eve the poor ignorant darkies huddled in their shacks , fearing the powers of darkness . . . . Nuts , Kate thought inelegantly , and gasped as Volz tossed her carelessly into the back seat of the car . The population of the town , black and white , knew enough to stay home tonight , but it was not superstition that kept them in , but a real , tangiblefear . Fear of the superior , sophisticated gentry of the town , whose combined wealth and power turned their vicioushobby into an instrument of terror . Had she been the only blind fool in the whole town ? Now that she knew , so many hints and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she would n't have believed , even if someone had warned her . She had n't even believed it that afternoon , when Peter had shown her the pattern . The pattern was there , it could n't be denied , but she had preferred to view it as the result of a suggestion made to a sick mind , carried out with the remorseless , twisted logic of madness . Peter had known the truth . He knew she wouldn'tP182believe him . Peter . . . She turned her head into the slick leather upholstery and stifled a moan . She had failed . And what lay in store for them both was worse even than she had imagined . Volz 's erratic , triumphant driving made even the expensivecar ride uncomfortably ; she was jolted and jarred , unable to fend herself off from the hard surfaces against which she was flung . Finally she managed to wedge herself into a corner so that she could see out the window . As she had expected , they were heading for her house . The gates stood open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a jolt that threw her forward . He left her in the car , and Kate tried to pull herself up . Surely there must be something she could do . . . . She was n't given time even to think . Volz was back almost at once , and Martin was with him . Between them they carried Peter . When they reached the car , Volz let his share of the burden drop with a thud and opened the back door . " Could n't you have waked him up ? " he demanded irritably . " We 'll have a hell of time dragging him through the brush . " " Feet in first , " Martin ordered . " He 'll be waking by the time we get there . I timed the injection carefully . But I do n't want him too wide awake . I underestimated his resistance once , and it almost ended in disaster . " " We got her back , " Volz grunted , jamming Peter 's legs into the car . He stood back while Martin efficiently manipulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some sign of awareness , and found none ; Peter slid bonelessly down onto the floor , his head and arms on the seat next to her . His breathingsounded odd . " Yes , you got her back , " Martin said contemptuously . He glanced into the car to make sure all was well ; his eyes met Kate 's and moved away without a flicker of expression . He slammed the door . " Thanks to me . " They moved around to the front of the car and Kate lost Volz 's response . It was evidently acrimonious , for as he took his seat Martin said in a conciliatory tone , " There 's no pointp183in quarreling . Certainly not tonight . All 's well that ends well . " Volz grunted and started the engine . Neither man spoke for the rest of the trip , which was incrediblybumpy ; they drove straight across the field onto the bridle path . It was wide enough to take the car , but Volz had to spin the wheel like a top to avoid the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter 's head slid off the seat and landed on the floor with a thud . Then she leaned forward , electrified , as he muttered something profane . He was coming around , but it was too late . The car jolted to a stop , its headlights framing the spot she had expected to see : a scarlet trail of poison ivy winding up a tree trunk , and a broken branch sticking out at an odd angle . The two men got out , and Martin opened the back door . He prodded Peter with his toe and got a half-intelligible epithet in response . " How 's that for accuracy ? " he said in a pleased voice . " He can stand now . We 'll have to drag him , but that 's easier than carrying . " " We ? Who 's going to carry her ? " " Untie her feet . " " You fool , she 'll bolt as soon as we get into the woods . " " With her hands tied she wo n't get far . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glumly . " And I 'm sick of chasing her around . We 're short on time as it is . " Martin pursed his lips and looked at Kate . She stared back at him , wishing looks could kill . " You would , would n't you , " he said meditatively . " Well , let 's spell out the obvious , shall we ? If you should leave us , I will immediately cut Mr. Stewart 's throat . It 's a quick way to go , they tell me , but not necessarily painless . " He raised his eyebrows inquiringly , waited for a moment , and then smiled . " I see we understand one another . " They got Peter on his feet , though he kept insisting he wanted to lie down . The final threat had finished Kate ; sheP184felt as if her whole body had gone to sleep , the way a foot does when it is twisted the wrong way for too long . At Martin 's commandshe stumbled docilely off down the path . The two followed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added a stream of curses every time they stumbled , which was fairly often . As soon as they were out of range of the car 's headlights , Martin switched on a flashlight which he held in his free hand . He shone it well in front of Kate 's feet , but she was unable to protect herself from low branches , and there were stinging cuts all over her face by the time they reached the glade . There , on another command , she stopped , and stood watchingsluggishly while Martin shone the light around . He finally selected a tall pine almost directly across the clearing from the black stone . They stood Peter up against it . As soon as they let go of him , he started sliding slowly down ; his eyes were closed and there was a satisfied smile on his face . Martin , who was holding the flashlight while Volz did the work , said something uncomplimentary , and Volz propped his unresisting prisoner up again . " He 's still too groggy , " he said angrily , and proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the face . The cure worked a little too well . Peter 's eyes opened , and widened in indignation . He grabbed Volz by the ears and brought his knee up . The blow was n't as hard as he intended it to be , but it was hard enough to flatten Volz . It happened so quickly , Kate did n't have time to react ; she had only taken two steps when Martin 's fist came down on the back of Peter 's neck . By the time she reached him , he was sprawled face down on the ground , and Martin , the flashlight now in his left hand , said calmly , " I have a gun , but I do n't think I 'll need it . All right , you incompetent idiot , get up . Must I do everything ? " Volz got up , but not with much enthusiasm . His face was the color of watered split-pea soup . Kate , who had been feelingfrantically for what turned out to be , when her unsteadyp185fingers finally located it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general staggered toward them . " You try that , " she said , seeing his foot draw back , " and I 'll pull your legs out from under you . " " Leave him alone , " Martin said wearily . " We 've wasted enough time . Besides , we would n't want him to miss the little surprise that 's in store for him , would we ? " Volz relaxed , diverted by the thought ; and Kate , who knew the sort of thought that diverted him , shivered . " Try it again , " Martin said . " Get a rope around his chest to hold him up , then tie his feet . From behind , " he added sarcastically . " I thought you were in the army once . " Volz gave him a sour look but obeyed without comment . He handled Peter circumspectly until he had him securely bound ; then he stood back and administered a hard backhandedblow across the face . Peter , who had begun to show a faint interest in the proceedings , subsided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the light , " he said coldly . " I 'll handle her . Ca n't you control yourself for a few hours , Harry ? " " I do n't like him , " Volz said simply . " Supercilious bastard . . . So long as I get a chance later . . . " That , as you know , will be the Master 's decision . " Volz 's reaction was surprising and a little chilling . He stiffened , as if standing at attention , and held the position for several seconds before doing as Martin directed . That was the end of the conversation . Martin went about his business with his usual efficiency . The tree to which Kate was tied was near Peter 's , but not quite near enough for her to touch him . Martin handled her impersonally , as if she were a parcel he was wrapping for the mail . He walked off without so much as a backward glance . Volz followed , carrying the flashlight ; for some time Kate could see it , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then it disappeared altogether ; and the dark swooped in . The wind still moaned high in the treetops , but a few stars were visible in the cloudy sky . Something moved furtively inp186the brush not far away , and Kate wrestled vainly with the ropes . Not that there were dangerous animals in the woods ; tales of wolf and bear were still told , but she did n't believe them . . . not really . All the same , it was unnerving to have anything , even a rabbit , approach when you were so helpless . She started when a voice said tentatively , " Kate . Is that you ? " " Yes . " " I was afraid of that . Where are you ? I ca n't see you . " " We 're back to back , so to speak . I ca n't see you either . I wish . . . I wish I could . " " lt would help , would n't it . I 'm sorry ; I seem to have missed a good deal this evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just before Martin hit me with a mountain or something . I gather you did n't make good your escape ? " " I made it , " she said miserably ; and in a few sentences recapitulated what had happened . " Well , do n't brood about it , " Peter said reasonably . " Thirteento one is poor odds . . . . Thirteen ? " " Nine of them at the general 's . And there are . . . four others . " Silence fell , broken only by the complaint of the winddrivenbranches . It did n't seem quite so dark now ; Kate 's eyes were beginning to adjust . She could see the shapes of the surroundingtrees and the menacing bulk of the black stone at the far end of the clearing . She waited for Peter 's response with an anxiety which was , under the circumstances , a trifle absurd . Finally he finished his mental accounting . " I did n't realize you knew about Tiphaine , " he said . " I did n't think you knew ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why ? Oh . It 's nice to know my atrocious acting convinced someone . The others must have been laughing up their sleeves the whole time . Tiphaine especially . " The tone in which he spoke the name filled Kate with a reprehensiblebut very human satisfaction . She said perversely , " I did n't think you could resist her . She 's very lovely . "   " Fishing for compliments at a time like this ? I 'll be damned if I 'll inflate your ego any further . . . . Oh , there were times when I wondered why I did n't fall in love with her . But I did n't  --  believe it or not . And when I added up the miscellaneousfacts I 'd acquired , the conclusion was inescapable . " " It escaped me . Though I 've always known there was something wrong about her . Living with her I 've seen things  --  a word , a look , nothing important ; but if you 'd known Stephan , you 'd worry about any child he brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously serious about his dirty little hobby . Tiphaine had all the earmarks of the convert . Even the change of name , at adolescence , when many of the girls were introduced to the cult . . . . " And the name itself . " " Yes , I caught that after I did some reading . And the FolkloreSociety , the executive committee of the coven . When I think of how they led me by the nose , from the minute I arrived in town , I could kick myself . And I sat there like the sacrificial goat , congratulating myself on my cleverness , . . . I wonder what did go on at those business meetings ? " Kate leaned back against the tree trunk , feeling the rough bark prickle through her shirt and hair . The position was n't as uncomfortable as it might have been ; Martin had tied the ropes tightly enough to prevent escape , but not tightly enough to hurt , unless she moved . " Peter . " " What ? " " About Mark . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident , Peter . I did n't mean to . " " I know that , " " How could you know ? " " Because now I know you . MacDonald would have my ears for that remark , " he added wryly . " Nailed to his wall . With me still attached . " " Who 's MacDonald ? " " My editor . " " Is that what you do ? " " Journalist , yes . "  | " Journalist ? Stewart . . . Is that who you are ? I read about you  --  oh , several years ago . About the trial . They said you were a spy . " " They usually do say that . " " I know you were n't . " " Well , I was , actually . At least I was guilty of conspiracy and aiding a criminal to escape . Unfortunately I was also inept . The escape failed . " " I remember hearing about the execution of the leader . " " I knew Jan at school , " Peter said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we got wind of the revolt being planned . First-hand reports from the rebel camp , that sort of crap . I went  --  I guess I hoped to talk Jan out of it . We knew it was bound to fail , the Russians have the satellites fast ; they ca n't let any one of them go without losing the rest . Jan knew it , too ; but men reach a point of desperation , where nothing matters but the need to act . . . . We almost got out , you know . But Jan had been wounded in the street fighting , he could n't go fast . I got what I deserved  --  less , really ; they could have shot me . There were times when I wished they had . " The calm , matter-of-fact voice stopped . The tears on Kate 's cheeks felt warm in the cold air . " One of those times must have been when you heard of Mark 's death , " she said . " Or did n't you find out till after you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let some letters come through , especially the ones with bad news . The worst of it was that I 'd heard from Mark just before I left  --  one of his hysterical scrawls , full of references to the cold-hearted bitch who 'd led him on and broken his heart . The beautiful succubus , La Belle Dame , et cetera . He 's my half-brother , that 's why our names are n't the same . Younger ; I always felt responsible for him , especially after Mother died , even though I knew he was a bloody mess . He was constantly getting into scrapes and having to be bailed out of them , and the scrapes kept getting nastier . That was how he came to the Embassy , in one of those nonessential social jobs ; I could n't think what the hell elsep189to do with him . The letter was typical Mark , full of self-pity and ravings about you . I did n't feel I could take the time to play Miles Standish  --  or was it the other fellow  --  not when Jan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west . " " And you 've been blaming yourself ever since . " " I 've always blamed myself for everything Mark did . It was Mother , I suppose ; is n't Mum the currently popular scapegoat ? Watch out for Mark , darling , you know he is n't strong . . . . Do n't let the big boys hurt Mark , Peter , he 's so sensitive . . . . ' She was a very beautiful woman , " he added wryly . " It never occurred to me to wonder why two different men had found her impossible to live with . " " No wonder you do n't like women . " " You can hardly accuse me of that . . . . Maybe I do . Maybe that 's why I was so ready to blame you for what happened to Mark . Transfer of guilt ? I hate the superficial psychological jargon we toss around these days . " " You were right to blame me . I 'd like to tell you how it happened  --  " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Irrelevant ? Murder ? " Her voice broke on the word , and when Peter answered , his voice had lost its calm . " Do you want me to say it , here and now , when we 'll probablyboth be dead before morning ? That I 'd condone anything you 've done , anything you ever will do ? If you told me you 'd annihilated an entire orphanage , I 'd probably just shrug . Oh , God , I 've done it again ! Always the wrong word . . . " I want to tell you about that , too , " Kate said softly . " She was so beautiful , Peter . Her eyes were blue -- not that dark smoky blue all new babies have , but a lovely clear azure , right from the first day . And bright fair hair , like  --  like yours . She was beginning to talk ; she really was , it was n't just babbling , she was very precocious . And she was crawling all over the place , puffing  --  she was so fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to her . Peter let her cry for a while . Then he said gently , " Can you move , at all ? Your hands ? Stretch them out ? "  |p190Kate  found that she could move , though only in one plane ; by pulling in all her muscles she could slide around the tree trunk inside the ropes . Squinting through the tears she had been holding in for months , she made out the excrescence on the next tree which was Peter . The starlight glinted faintly off his hair . Groping , she felt his fingers meet and close on the tips of hers . " Feeling better ? " he asked . " Yes . " Kate sniffed . " I do n't know why I should , but I do . " " Why did n't you marry him ? He said he 'd asked you . " " After Uncle Stephan died . " " And you inherited how many million dollars . I see . " " It was n't only that . I guess I was afraid of marrying anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart for my own good . But I was n't smart enough to conceal my brains . " " Why should you ? " Kate sniffed again . She longed desperately for a handkerchief , and a free hand with which to wield it . " Because men do n't like intelligent women , " she said in a muffled voice . " And neither do other women . " " I do , " Peter said persuasively . " Oh , you . " Kate laughed ; it was a choked , hoarse sound , but it was genuine . " You 're different . " " Naturally . " " I mean , you believe in yourself . You 're sufficiently competentto accept competence in other people without resentingit . " " There you go again . " " Well , it 's true . But Mark  --  it was n't self-confidence that he lacked , he thought he was entitled to everything in the world . " Kate laughed again , bitterly this time . " The truth is that I caught him with Tiphaine one day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion to me . So maybe I was just plain jealous , and to hell with the psychological analysis . I threw him out  --  out of the house , out of my life . I had  --  the baby . It was kept secret , of course ; Tiphaine knew , and Martin , but they were the only ones . " This mother-love business is n't a simple reflex , you know ;  |p191at  first the baby was just a duty , a responsibility . I set up an arrangement , with an apartment and a live-in nurse , in Baltimore , and I went up to see her once a week . Then , after a while , I found I was going oftener , and staying longer . . . . I knew I had to have her with me , all the time . And Mark was being intolerable ; he 'd gone back to Washington , but he was here every weekend , staying with Volz and harassing me . He knew about the baby , but he did n't know where she was  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I even consideredmarrying Mark , just for long enough to give her a name  --  so she would n't have to grow up with that stigma . Then she . . . she got sick . They go so quickly when they 're small . " " And you blamed yourself for that . " " Yes , of course . It was foolish  --  the woman , the nurse , was the best to be had . She loved her , too . But I could n't . . . I did n't . . . " Did Mark know ? " " Not then . I was a little mad , I think ; Tiphaine and Martin knew , they went to . . . the funeral with me . Then Mark insisted on meeting me . It was at night . He asked me to marry him again , and mentioned the baby . . . . I told him then , I think I screamed it at him . And he said  --  do you know what he said ? " " I think I can guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? You can imagine how I felt . It was like  --  offering a child a new puppy to replace the one that died . I wanted to kill him . I did . He had a gun ; he 'd been waving it around , threatening to shoot himself ; but I was n't impressed because I knew Mark would never deprive the world of anything as wonderful as himself . When he said . . . that . . . I flew at him . Somehow the gun went off . I ran ; I knew he must be dead , though they did n't tell me so till next day . It was Martin who found him , and Martin who signed the death certificate . The loyal family friend . . Your hand 's all wet . Sticky . . . Peter . . . " The general ties a mean knot , " he admitted apologetically . " You sure he was n't in the navy ? Kate , darling , youp192are n't crying about that . . . ? I appreciate your sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " She turned her head . It was a strain on the muscles of her neck and shoulders , but at least she could see him . " You have a beautiful nose , " she said irrelevantly , and heard Peter snort with amusement . " Sam was right , as always . " " Who is Sam ? " " Friend of mine . A private detective who once lectured me on the foibles of the female . Whom I hired to investigate you . I do n't think I 'd feel quite so rotten right now if my consciencewere clear . " " Do n't think about that . My own conscience is a little smudged . " " I 'll be damned if I can see why . If there was ever a born murderee , it was Mark . If he had n't had the gun , you 'd have scratched his face , and he 'd have slugged you  --  he would have , you know  --  and that would have been the end of it . As for the baby  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Whereas I  --  " " No , I 'm worse than you , worse than you , " Kate said promptly , and heard him chuckle . " Okay , this is rather pointless , is n't it ? Anyway , I 've had my punishment . When I realized I love you  --  " " When did you ? " " What ? " " Realize . " " Of all the stupid questions to ask at a time like this . . . I do n't like to destroy your romantic illusions , but I think the process began the other afternoon , in this very spot . " " It 's . . . a little too much , is n't it ? " Kate said after a moment . " I 'm sorry ; I 'm trying not to make this any harder for you , but  --  " " I 'd encourage you to break loose and scream your head off if I thought it would do any good , " Peter said harshly . " But there wo n't be a living soul in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a reign of terror this group has imposed on the town ? The coven has so many ways of exert/ing pressure ; not only superstitious fear  --  and there 's a lot more of that lingering than we like to admit  --  but purely physical threats . Good God , these people can literally get away with murder  --  and produce half a dozen impeccable witnesses who would swear they were somewhere else at the time . A doctor has all sorts of chances for skulduggery  --  drugs , poisons , falsifying postmortem reports . . . Then there 's blackmail as a weapon of power . It would n't do a certain distinguished Senator much good if his associates knew he spent several nights a year trying to raise the Devil . " " And succeeding , " Kate said . " The god is incarnate , you know , in the head of the coven , the Master of  --  Peter ! " " What ? Someone coming ? " " No , I just remembered something . Maybe you did n't hear it . Volz was knocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said something about getting his chance later . " " Thanks . That makes me feel a lot better . " " That 's not the point . Martin answered that any such decisionwould have to be up to the Master . " " Well , naturally , " Peter agreed ; she heard leaves rustle as he shifted his feet , and knew he was still trying to free himself . " Ca n't have the rank and file making such important decisions . Discipline must be maintained , even if . . . Wait a minute , I see what you 're driving at . I thought Martin was the chief devil . " " So did I. Martin or Volz . Could it be the Senator ? " " Some covens , " Peter said , in a different voice , " had a woman leader . " " La Reine du Sabbat , " Kate murmured . " Or the Queen of Elfhame . Scottish custom , if I remember your book correctly . " " Peter , if it 's Tiphaine , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's not responsible , Kate . Your esteemed uncle had years to make her what she is . " " Think of her as mad , " Kate said bitterly . " That will help . . . . Look , it 's getting lighter . The moon must be rising . " They watched in silence as the pale half-orb swam into sight through the tossing boughs . It was on the wane , and gavep194little light , but to their dark-accustomed eyes the change was considerable . The shape of the glade was clear now , with the black stone standing out like an incarnate threat . " Running water , and the stone , and the clearing in the woods , " Kate muttered . " The classic features of the Sabbath meeting place ; and I never saw it . That 's why you were here today . " " Yes , I hoped to find concrete evidence of what I suspected ; I knew I could never convince you without something definite , I was having a hard enough time believing it myself . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place very often . " " Four times a year . If they go by the book . " " Allhallows , May Eve , Candlemas , and Lammas Eve . I 've done my homework , you see . What do you suppose they 're going to do tonight ? " " There are all sorts of variants , " Kate said . " From a Black Mass , with defilement of the Christian sacraments , to a good old fashioned orgy , a la fertility cult . The original witch covens tended toward the latter variety , but I expect sophisticateslike Martin , who 've read the books , have added their own touches . " " Added is about right . The original cult must go back a long way . " " Why ? " " Miss Device 's family history is a little bit coincidental , do n't you think ? And this clearing must have been planned , especially the stone . It 's been there for centuries , I could tell that much . I have a feeling , though , that the coven did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it a shot in the arm . " " People like the general . He could contribute such nice  --  Peter . . . " What 's wrong ? " " Look . There . " It was dim at first , only a twinkle like that of a fallen star caught among the trees ; but the star shone red . A few minutes later she heard the voices .   " They 're coming , " she said . " Kate . " His voice was rough , no longer pretending . " They 'll probably untie us  --  you , at least  --  at some point . To arrange the . . . tableau . . . . The light was brighter now , and the voices louder . They rose and fell in a strange stiff rhythm that had not yet taken on a tune . " If they do , " Peter went on , " try to make a break for it . Bite , kick  --  " " I 'm awfully stiff , " Kate said , watching the light . Torches ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path , go into the woods . If they kill you , it will at least be a more dignified way of dying . " " All right . " It did n't seem to matter , now . Torches , yes . ' The head of the procession came into view ; they had to go single file along the narrow path . The torches burned high and fiercely , giving off a dark smoke which writhed and broke in the wind . One by one they came , steppingin rhythm to the odd , jerky tune . It was a dance tune , but the tune had been ancient when the flames of the Inquisitiondestroyed the reasoning world . One by one they came , the same eldritch crew she had seen in the stableyard . If they had seemed nightmare creatures there , they were worse now , in the wild wind-tossed clearing , under a flickering moon  --  visions of a madman 's fancy , productsof delirium . The weaving line moved out into the center of the glade , before the stone , and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel . It blazed up with a roar , sending a column of red flame soaring . Kate felt Peter 's nails boring into her hand . They were circling the fire now , still to the same weird tune ; some had produced musical instruments , small drums and pipes and  --  good heavens , Miss Device 's violin . . . . " And the Hags and Sorcerers do howl and vary their hellish cries high and low counterfeiting a kind of villainous music . They also daunce at the sound of Viols and other instruments , which are brought thither by those that were skilled to play upon them . "  |p196All  by the book  --  how thoroughly they had done their research . Or was- it from minds like these that the material in the books had come ? From Miss Device , jerking and stamping , her face rapt under the stiff white cap ; from Mrs. Adams , whose coarse gray locks flew as she gyrated wildly ? Widdershins around the fire  --  against the sun , the Devil 's direction . And that tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it before , in a concert of medieval dances ; the melody formless , the rhythm irregular ; no ending , no resolution , only an endless repetition . The rhythm lacked the syncopated sensuality of good dance music ; it was monotonous , almost prim . Yet after a time the queer beat got into the listener 's blood . . . Kate jerked herself erect , shivering , as she felt her knees and bent arms beginning to twitch . The circle widened so that the dancers passed within a few feet of the prisoners ; but only one paid them any heed  --  Volz , whose eyes glinted whitely at Peter each time he went by . The faces were terrible in their set absorption ; all eyes , except those of the general , seemed to be looking at somethinginvisible to normal sight . Their skins had an odd cast , dusky and greasy , as if they had been streaked with oily soot .... " The fatte of young children , the blood of a flitter mouse , solanum somniferum , and oleum . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodys exceedinglie. . . by this means in a moonlight night they seem to be carried in the aire . . . . The witches ' flying ointment . It contained other ingredients beside the ghastly mess Scot had mentioned . Belladonna and aconite , hemlock . . . delirium-inducing drugs , when absorbedthrough a cut or open sore . That was how the medievalwitches had " flown " to the Sabbath , in the delirious visions of the drug . By the book ; again , by the book . Kate cursed her inconvenient memory . She was remembering other parts of the ceremony . Tiphaine was not among the dancers . Kate had mentally braced herself for her cousin 's appearance  --  in what outre costume , for God 's sake , and in what role ? A few dancersp197were so masked and robed as to be unidentifiable , but she would have known Tiphaine by her size , and her grace . The Master , of course , would make his appearance later , on the platform which had been prepared to receive his presence three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution , with a dying failure on a minor chord . The dancers dropped to the ground and lay still . How long the girl had been there Kate did not know ; the slender figure had been masked by the central fire . Now she moved out away from the rock against which she had been leaning . She seemed to walk above the ground , not on it ; her slim bare feet  --  bare , on such a night  --  scarcely pressed the dry leaves . She wore a costume similar to Joan 's , but on her the effect was different ; the slender dryad 's body shone whitely through the tatters of the scanty tunic . The dark leaves twisted in her hair looked as if they had grown there . She was perfectly at ease , attuned to the fantasy of the coven as she had never been to the real world . The Queen of Elfhame ; la Reine du Sabbat ; the witch girl , baptized in the Old Religion and raised in its tenets . Kate heard Peter 's voice catch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own heart was pounding . This was the closest she had ever come to the reality of black magic . The rest had been stage devices , human perversities , or neuroses ; but if Tiphaine had been born in 161o , she would have gone to the stake singing , and cried the praises of her Dark Lord while the flames licked up to meet the flame of her hair . The girl turned , lifting her arms ; and the whole foul crew leaped up , with a wild scream of welcome and adoration . On top of the black stone stood a solitary figure . It was not his own skin he was wearing , though the garmentfit as snugly ; no human flesh ever gleamed with that dull scaly luster or gave such a hint of dark coarseness . The hands were like paws ; when he raised them in response to the greeting of his worshipers , the sharpened claws glittered in the firelight . The monstrous head was partly in shadow ,  |p198but  the features were not , could not be , human . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , and pointed ears like those of a goat . The head turned , in a lordly survey , and the second face came into view  --  another set of opposingfeatures on the back of the head . The two-headed god , Janus of the Romans . . . Peter 's hand moved , in a gesture so savage that it twisted Kate 's wrist . She cried out ; but the pain brought her out of her horrified trance . She saw the poised figure atop the stone for what it was : not a hairy Fiend , but a man wearing a close-fitting garment of leather that covered his entire body , even to the hands . The glitter of those claws suggested a modern improvement on the ancient costume described by so many writers  --  metal , perhaps . And the head , of course , was masked ; the goat-satyr face attributed to the fertility god , the double face found in some of the cults . It was , she told herself with deliberate emphasis , a damned effective outfit , and the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young ; his body was slight , but built like that of an athlete . The howling circle was in movement again ; no music now , only wild shrieks of adoration . As each worshiper moved to a position directly in front of the stone , he turned and bent back , lifting one foot . Another part of the old ritual ; the more perverse form of worship was impractical with the devil up there on his throne . Kate 's inconvenient memory was botheringher again  --  this time with a part of the ritual which she had tried desperately to forget . " Witches confessing that the devil lies with them , and withal complaining of his tedious and offensive coldness . . . " The fertility rites , and the marriage of the God . . . " There appeared a great Black Goat with a Candle between his Horns . . . . He had carnal knowledge of her which was with great pain . . . . " " A meikle , black , roch man , werie cold ; and I fand his nature als @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is abler for us in that way than any man can be , onlie he was heavie lyk a malt sek ; a hudge nature , verie cold , as yce . " The hard leather covering of the body ; Margaret Murray 's reference to the phallic cults of Egypt andp199Greece . . . She heard someone breathing in harsh , chokinggasps , and thought it was she herself . Then she turned to look at Peter . His face was frozen in a spasm of horror and his wide eyes were fixed on the slight , posturing figure on the stone . As Kate looked back , the leather-clad form flexed its knees and jumped , landing lightly on its feet . He was in splendid physical condition ; the movement had looked like flying . But it was a pedestrian stroll that brought the weird figure across the glade toward them . The worshipers fell back before him , with the same archaic , backward bow . Tiphaine followed , two paces in the rear , like a priestess following the sacramentalobjects . As the'figure circled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask . It was a beautiful piece of work , a clever mingling of goat and human . The straggling beard and muzzledmouth were animal ; the eyes , shining out from under heavy coarse brows , were those of a man . It was the sight of those eyes that gave Kate her first clue , and she felt her face freeze in the same incredulous horror that still held Peter rigid . Pacing slowly , the bizarre shape came toward them and stopped . The clawed hand fumbled at the throat , and the mask slipped up , and off . The face was Timmy 's face . But the thick fair hair , tumbled by the removal of the mask , was not Timmy 's . The easy athlete'swalk had not been Timmy 's shambling stride . The eyes , bright and intelligent . . . Again the clawed hand lifted ; this time , with a very human " Damn ! " the man stripped off the awkward glove , and raised his hand to the livid face . The whole fiery birthmark peeled off ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been crumbling to dust for almost a year . Mark 's face.  |p200He  did n't look a day older . The blue eyes narrowed with amusement as they met hers ; the mouth was smiling . He was as handsome as ever , almost too handsome . . . as ever . . . Kate was n't aware that she was fainting until she heard Peter 's voice , repeating her name . She shook her head , blinkingthrough the gray fog that blanketed her mind , looking , not at the beautiful smiling face in front of her , but at Peter . Under the ruddy firelight that gave his face a false flush , he was white as paper . The shock had driven the blood from his face , but not from his brain ; he knew what she must be thinking . " He 's real , Kate . You did n't kill him . Do n't start imagining . . . . Kate ! " " I 'm all right , " she muttered . " What , " Mark said , " no tender welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice  --  the one that had haunted her for months . No wonder Timmy never spoke . " I expected more reaction , " Mark went on cheerfully . " My fond brother and my  --  I 've always liked the word paramour , ' have n't you , Kate ? So much more refined and Elizabethanp201than the other terms . . . . But I understand that in this , as in so many of my other specialties , my big brother has surpassedme . " " Blanks , " Kate said . " Blanks in the gun . " " Red paint and all the rest , " Mark agreed . " Martin was lurking , unseen , in order to bear you away if you overcame your squeamishness and started to investigate the corpse . But you fled , like a nice timid female . " " Why ? Why did you do it ? " " Money , " Mark said , with an air of pointing out the obvious . " What else ? Oh , there were other reasons . Tiphaine has never liked you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm sure he did it deliberately , the old devil  --  her dislike ripened into something deeper . As for me , it hurts my feelings to be rejected . I 've enjoyed watching you squirm . " His gloved hand lifted ; the steel claws pricked Kate 's cheek . Peter said something unintelligible , and moved his head . Mark turned toward him . " I 've hated you all my life , " he said calmly . " It 's quite natural ; any psychologist could explain it to you . Gratitude is a fiction ; the normal return for favors rendered is resentment . Only imagine , dear brother , how profound my resentment of you ! All I ever needed to do was yell for help , and there you were , panting with zeal , ready to bail me out . Only  --  the last time I yelled for help you did n't come . " " You must have known why . " " Oh , yes , I knew ; I read the newspapers . " Mark chuckled . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't awfully comfortable , I 'm told . But I thought you 'd turn up sooner or later ; that uncomfortable conscience of yours . And you were stupid enough to use your own name when you booked your room . Not that I blame you , " he added condescendingly . " You thought I was dead , and assumedno one else would recognize the name . Little did you know that we were all ready and waiting for you . " There were beads of perspiration on Peter 's forehead ; they reflected the firelight like drops of blood.  | " I ca n't get you out of this mess unless you release us , " he said . " I do n't need you to get me out of it , " Mark snapped . " I did n't really need you when I wrote that letter . This "  --  his misshapen hand swept out to include the circle of costumed figures  --  " this is stronger than you ever could be . And I 'm its head , Peter . I 'm the head devil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her cousin . Tiphaine 's eyes were fixed on Mark ; they were rapt with a blasphemous devotion . Her fervorwas genuine . Could n't she see that Mark was using her , and the coven , for his own ends ? Kate missed Peter 's next comment as her eyes moved from Tiphaine to the other members of the coven . The ceremony was proceeding . Next on the agenda was the ceremonial meal , and if she had been watching the proceedings from some safe , hidden spot , the activity would have moved her to sick amusement . Most of the Sabbath meals , as described by medieval participants , consisted of ordinary food  --  meat and bread and wine . She herself had expressed doubt , in her book , about the legends of cannibalism and noxious beverages . And this spoiled crowd  --  perhaps later , when their frenzy had increased , they might be capable of consuming human flesh or urine , or bread made of flour from unspeakablesources . Now they were setting out what appeared to be a conventional picnic supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fussily weighing down the corners of the white cloth with wine bottles . Red wine . Naturally . . . And what an elegant little supper it was  --  foie gras and caviar and imported cheeses , crusty French bread . . . . Kate suppresseda rising tide of nausea . She had n't eaten since breakfast , but she was n't hungry . Most of the hampers and baskets had been emptied of their contents now ; only one large basket still remained , on the ground by the stone . Some special delicacy , perhaps , for dessert . They were n't going to unpack it now , they were waiting for their chief to join them . Mrs. Adams daintily plucked a few dried leaves from the damask picnic cloth ; her streamingp203gray hair fell across her cheeks and chin , leaving the sharp nose in silhouette . Everything was ready . But Mark could n't tear himself away ; he was enjoying this . " I succeeded old Stephan , " he was saying as Kate turned her attention back to the conversation . " He and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rather a slap in the face for Martin ; he 'd been fancying himself as heir apparent . But Stephan knew that for Martin the coven was only a means to an end . For the rest of us , it 's an end in itself . " He turned to smile at Tiphaine , and Kate burst out , " For the rest of them , maybe , but not for you . Money , power , control , that 's what you want . You asked me to marry you because of the money . When that failed , you staged your own murder so you could blackmail me . " " You have such a simple mind , " Mark said fondly . The steel claw touched her cheek again , and pricked a little deeper . " Do you think you were my only problem ? I owed a good deal of money , dear , not only locally , but to some threateninggentlemen in New York . Not to mention the irate fathersof certain damsels . . . Without Peter to rescue me from myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could disappear , and make money on the deal , as they say here . . . Timmy was no loss . And he was so splendidly easy to imitate . " " And we thought someone was using Timmy , " Kate muttered . " But you were perfectly correct . " The fire soared and crackled , sending red flames licking at the lower branches . Kate wondered how they kept the dry leaves from catching . The whole clearing would go up like a torch if the fire got out of hand . " Being Timmy did limit me , though , " Mark went on blithely . " I could n't get in and out of costume quickly , so I had to rely on my voice to remind you of past events . Peter was more effective ; I got a lot of innocent amusement out of watching his performances and recalling our boyhood days , when we sent off for occult literature and tried to conjure up demons in the schoolroom . Yes , he was very useful  --  untilp204the night when he interfered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand toward his brother 's face , and Peter jerked back , too late . Blood began streaming down his face , and Mark giggled . " Reflexes a little slow , " he said in a voice which was higher than his normal tones . " I do n't imagine you 're feeling too well , are you ? Had a bad day altogether . Well , it wo n't be long now . I promised the general a few minutes of fun , but do n't worry , there is n't too much he can do . We do n't want any odd marks which would be hard to explain in a post-mortem . " " What are you going to do with us ? " Kate hated to give him the satisfaction of asking , but she could n't help it . " It ought to interest you . These people have kept the ritualamazingly pure  --  in the scholarly sense , that is . No Black Mass . So you do n't need to worry about being stretched out naked on the altar , or anything crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Sarcastic as ever . " Mark threw his head back , laughing , and caught at the mask as it slipped backward . He readjusted it on top of his head , where it formed a fantastic frame for his young face . " We have to consider the practical problem , you see . When the two of you are found tomorrow , it must appear to be an ordinary murder and suicide . Martin has considerable influence in these matters , but we do n't want to take any chances , in case your lawyer gets sticky about the will . " " I see . " " But we can still kill two birds with one stone . Tonight is the night of the Passion  --  a far older ceremony than the Christian imitation , only two thousand years ago . The god must die , as nature dies , so that life can be reborn in the spring . " " Every seven years , " Kate said . " That 's right ; you 're the authority on fertility cults , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But they do it every year , here . A local refinement . "  | " But you 're the  --  god , " Peter said . He was only an amateur at this , Kate remembered ; his early religious training had left its imprint , under the layers of adult skepticism , and his disgust showed in face and voice . It annoyed Mark ; he made another lunge with his clawed hand , and Peter flinched . " I 'm the god , " Mark said . Then Kate saw what really drove him , under the superficialvices of avarice and cruelty . She looked away , unable to endure the sight of either brother ; Peter 's sick helplessness was as painful as Mark 's madness . " But naturally , " Mark went on in his normal voice , " I do n't die . Impractical . And so permanent . . . No , we have the substitute procedure , and a very nice one it is , too . Can you imagine a more appropriate substitute ? Tiphaine tried earlier today , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . It was a bit premature , actually . All your fault , " he added , turning to Kate . " That idiotic song , and your suggestion , gave her the idea . " " But you ca n't , " Kate gasped . " No one will believe . . Why should I kill Peter ? Or is it the other way around ? " " No , no , you had it right the first time . I think , you know , that they will believe it  --  once Peter 's real identity gets out , which it will . People are already talking about my ' accidentaldeath , ' you know . . . . I need n't spell it out , not for a woman of your intellectual attainments . " " And Martin will reluctantly testify that I 've been going slowly insane for months , " Kate said slowly . " With Tiphaine and the Schmidts to back him up , I do n't see how it can fail , " Mark said cheerfully . His eyes moved from Kate 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are , of course , certain preliminary ceremonies , " he said . Tiphaine glided forward . Kate thought spitefully that her face had lost some of its unearthly concentration . She was human enough to be jealous . " They are waiting , " she said , touching Mark on the shoulder . " I 'll bet they are , " Peter said . " Especially the old spinstersp206like Miss Device , and that bored , overweight wench , whateverher name is . . . . How far do your duties extend , Mark ? I never did believe those stories of yours . " " Peter , " Kate said warningly ; but Mark was n't annoyed . " I delegate some duties , " he said , grinning ; and the leeringgoat 's head perched on his brow echoed the expression . " The ritual marriage is consummated with the Queen of the Sabbath . " He held out his hand to Tiphaine , and she took it , with a grave inclination of her head . " And , " Mark added negligently , " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiphaine 's annoyance was plainer , and Mark saw it . Still holding her hand , he pulled the mask down into position . " A bientdt ! " he said , and , leading his lady by the hand , started back toward the rock pedestal . With the incarnate god presiding , the ritual supper got underway . It included a few refinements not ordinarily seen at picnics . The climax of the rite was yet to come , but the participants had already shed several layers of civilized behavior . Volz wallowed like the pig he resembled , cramming food into his mouth and drinking his wine directly from the bottle . As the meal proceeded and the bottles were emptied , Kate was reminded , not so much of the witchcraft reports , as of lurid tales of Roman banquets . Sprawled on the ground , the members were paired ; two by two . Perhaps the activities would n't have been so obscene if she had n't known these people so well , especially the older , more respected citizens . . . . Ironic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a cool scholarly detachment , and yet turn sick at the actual sight . The wine was flowing freely , not only into individual mouths , but from mouth to mouth and onto the already stained costumes . But Kate knew it was not the wine which brought the red flush to Miss Device 's sallow cheeks , nor the wild glitter into the Senator 's eyes . Volz poured the dregs of his fourth bottle down the front of Joan 's inadequate bodice , and bent forward . Kate closed her eyes . She heard Peter swear , fluently , and without lowering hisp207voice ; she heard the leaves in the dark wood rustle as some four-footed creature crept through the night . Remembering her earlier fear of nocturnal animals , she could have smiled . Then lesser sounds were drowned as the music began again . It was faster and louder now . The dance was different too , though it was just as ancient ; the dancers paired off , locking elbows , back to back . The crackle of dried leaves came again , so close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the cacophonous din could be called music . Kate forgot her major preoccupation in momentary wonder . They were at the very edge of the clearing ; only darkness lay behind them , darkness and the tangled brush . But surely no forest animal would approach so close . . . . Then came a sound that almost took her breath away by its very normalcy , in the midst of nightmare . The sounds of a soft , human voice . " Do n't turn , do n't talk . Do n't look surprised . " For the life of her  --  and it might have been just that  --  Kate could n't repress a start and a gasp . Luckily the others were too concerned with their own activities to notice . Peter was more controlled . His profile , outlined against the dark foliage , remained immobile . " Jackson , " he said , on a long , sighing breath . " Yes , it 's me . Do n't let your arms fall when I cut these ropes . Move ' em a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Peter 's face , fighting the urge to crane her neck and look back . She knew , by the twist of his mouth , when his arms were freed . Then she felt Hilary 's big , warm hands on hers , and the ropes fell away . He held her wrists , taking some of the strain off her numbed arms , rubbing them to get the blood flowing freely . After a few minutes his hands moved to her ankles . " Kate ? " Peter spoke without turning his head . " Yes , all right . I 'm free now . " " Good . Jackson , get the hell out of here . " " I 'm staying . " " For God 's sake  --  as soon as we make our break , they'llp208be buzzing like flies , all over the woods . I 'll give you five minutes ' start . " Five minutes ? Kate wondered whether they had five more minutes  --  or whether five minutes would be long enough to restore limbs numbed by cold and confinement . Flexing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dried leaves rustle , she was still caught by the ghastly fascination of the rite of the Sabbath . Her scholar 's instinct , so long dormant , was not dead ; if she survived  --  what a book she could make out of this ! Peter and Hilary were arguing in whispers which were becomingdangerously shrill . She turned her head to expostulate . Then she heard what Hilary was saying . " I 'm not going anywhere . And neither are you . " Staring straight ahead , hands still behind him , Peter said softly , " We 're going , all right . Through you , if we must . " " Why the hell do you think I came ? To save you ? " Hilary 's emotion was so intense that words failed him ; he stuttered wildly for a second before he could go on . " Look over there , look  --  to the right of the stone , on the ground . That 's what I came for . And you 'll help me , or I 'll kill you myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to locate the objecthe indicated . Her mind fought the dawning knowledge as her eyes denied the proof of it . By the stone . . . the basket she had noticed at the beginning of the meal . Only it was n't a basket . It was made of some plastic material , with metal supports to hold it upright , and attachments by which it could be fastened to the seat of a car . She had bought one like it to take . . . to take the baby . . . Her stomach rebelled in a surge of nausea so violent it almost bent her over . It was only her imagination , she could n't have heard it over the screams of the dancers : the high , thin wail that seemed to come from the carrier by the stone . " Impossible , " Peter whispered . " Not even these  --  how could they ? Where did they get it ? " Kate did n't have to wait for Hilary 's explanation . " The Foundling Home . Some of them are on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falsifying records . . . Most of the babies are illegitimate , unwanted . . . . Peter ! " He did n't hear her . He did n't have to ; there was no need for discussion of ends , only of means . " Is it yours ? " he asked , and Hilary answered simply , " I do n't know . Does it matter ? " " No . " Peter began to shiver , violently and uncontrollably . " Get over there , through the trees , to the nearest cover . When you see me step out and raise my arms , grab the basketand run . " " What are you going to do ? " Hilary asked . " What the hell can I do ? Dance , sing , do card tricks . Anythingto attract attention . I suppose it would be too much to expect you to have a weapon ? " They were speaking in near normal tones ; the frenzied howling had risen to a pitch that made whispering unnecessary . The dancers had abandoned any attempt at rhythm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plucking at the collar of her dress . Kate 's hands were clenched so tightly that her nails pierced the skin of her palms , but she did n't feel the pain . That would be the time , when the dancers were locked in the embracewhich was the culmination of the rite . They would be blind and deaf to anything else . They were nearing the climax now . But would the sacrifice come first ? Each time one of the reeling figures neared the stone , and the pitiful little object beside it , Kate 's breath stopped . She had almost forgotten Peter 's question , it took Hilary so long to answer it . " The general 's rifle , " he said briefly . " Here . " Peter 's right side was the one farthest away ; she did n't see his arm move , but she could tell , by his face , when his fingerstouched the weapon . " Maybe you 'd better keep it , " he said reluctantly . " Ca n't handle a rifle and the basket . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be long now . Hurry . " Hilary did n't waste breath in answering ; she heard thep210same cautious rustle of leaves which had heralded his approach . Peter said , out of the corner of his mouth , " This does n't include you . As soon as I move , you run . Straight back , avoid the path . " " If you think I 'm going to leave that child . . . and you . . " What are you planning to do , throw stones ? If Jackson and I fail , you 're our last hope . " He took her silence for agreement . Kate saw no point in arguing ; she knew she was n't going to go . Stones , yes , if that was all she could do . She had left him once before , not knowingwhether she would see him alive again ; once in a lifetimewas once too much , she could n't do it twice . And the baby . . . Under the impetus of a fear which was not for her own person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would run , but not toward freedom -- around the clearing , following Hilary . If any one of the mob defied the threat of the rifle , to pursue the boy and his burden , she might be able to help . Was Hilary in position yet ? She strained her eyes through the smoke and the flames toward a glossy-leaved holly which was the nearest point of concealment . It was a good twenty feet away from the basket , and there was nothing between except flat ground and fallen leaves . There was no sign of Hilary , not even a movement of the jagged green leaves . But there would n't be  --  not until Peter stepped out in full view of the frenzied group and the cold-eyed spectator atop the rock . He had a gun , yes ; but what good would that be against a pack of maddened animals ? She looked at Peter . He stood as he had been standing for hours , slightly slumped , his head bowed . It would have taken a close examination to see that he was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one that circledhis chest , so that a quick movement would release it . What was he waiting for ? Miss Device was the first to go . She collapsed onto the ground , writhing and tearing at her clothes ; her face was distorted almost out of recognition , and from her squared mouth came an animal scream . The ghoul-figure at her side  --  good God , was it Will Schmidt ?  --  dropped down beside her . As if a signal had been given , the others followed ; it was a contagious mania , a communicable madness , like the dancingcrazes of the Middle Ages or the blood lust that moves a lynch mob . Within moments the glade was littered with movingbodies . The effect was too much , even for someone who had known what to expect ; Kate turned her head away . Now , surely , was the time for them to move . Peter stirred , and she tensed  --  if further tension was possible . She had been standing poised for flight for what seemed an eternity . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't even look at her . He was staring straight ahead , his head lifted ; the blank pallor of his face and the intensity of his gaze made him look drugged or entranced . Then Kate realized what he saw , and why he had not moved . High on his black throne , the masked figure surveyed his devotees . Tiphaine was clinging to him shamelessly , but he made no response . The goat 's mask held its frozen leer ; Kate sensed that , behind it , Mark was also smiling . This was the supreme moment for him , not the sexual release the others sought . There had always been something mechanical about his lovemaking , skilled as it was . Watching other people lose the control he never lost gave him a sense of superiority ; and his triumph was intensified by the fact that his brother was a witness to it . One part of his awareness had been , and still was , focused on Peter . And there it seemed likely to remain . The mating of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized this too ; Kate looked back at him in time to meet his eyes . They were as empty of expression as was the rest of his face , and his lips barely moved when he spoke . " Now . Move , damn it ; I wo n't until you do . " She had been ready for so long , her hands braced against the , tree trunk to give that one additional burst of speed ; now , at the word of command , she could n't move . The secondsstretched out impossibly as she stood , staring at him with an intensity that made her eyes ache . When she finally forced herself into motion , it was like pulling against something that stretched and held , and hurt when it broke . P212She crashed blindly through the undergrowth parallel to the clearing with no clear notion of what she was doing . The crack of a branch across her head stung her into awareness , and she stopped . She was panting as if she had run for miles . The first thing she noticed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing she could hear was the pounding of her heart and the agonized wheeze of her breathing . From the glade , to her left , came no sound at all except the voicelessroar of the fire . She was only a few feet away from the edge of the clearing ; the fire glow shone weirdly through the tangled vines and bushes , throwing distorted leaping shadows along the ground . But no sound ; no sound at all . Arms up before her face , Kate plunged through a matted curtain of something that was probably poison ivy , and then she saw what had happened . It had seemed to her that she had been thrashing about in the bushes for long minutes , but no more than seconds could have passed since she darted out of the clearing . It had taken Hilary the same length of time to cover the longer , though not entangled , distance between his hiding place and the rock . He was the first person she noticed , partly because he was the only one in motion ; head down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his goal . The Witches ' Sabbath  --  an oil , in full color , frozen now into two-dimensional horror . The sprawled , pallid bodies were still ; here and there a blank white face lifted blindly . Mark , atop the rock , looked like a statue out of one of the more esoteric museums  --  an institution specializing in **26;10712;TOOLONG . From her new vantage point Kate could see both faces of the monstrous mask ; it looked doubly horrifying atop the slender , poised body . Kate took it all in in a single , panoramic sweep of vision ; then she saw Peter , and for one blissfully simple moment she forgot everything else in an upsurge of primitive female admiration . She could n't see his face ; it was hidden by the stock of the gun and by his raised arm . The marks of the ropes on his wrist were only too visible ; in the strange light they lookedp213like ragged black lines , and the flesh around them was swollenand dark . But the finger curled around the trigger of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed unwaveringlyat its target  --  Mark . Hilary reached the basket , scooped it up in both arms , and whirled around . One of the panting glassy-eyed figures on the ground heaved itself to its knees with an animal snarl . It was Volz ; it would be , Kate thought . Peter 's voice echoed emphatically through the empty night : " Do n't move , Volz , or I 'll take care of your sacrifice for you . " " Stop , " Mark said clearly . Volz dropped down to his hands and knees . Hilary had almost reached the edge of the clearing . Kate knew he was running as he had never run before , but he seemed to be moving in slow motion , like a defective film . The clumsy size of the basket hampered him ; why did n't he take the child out ? He could carry it in one arm and have the other free . . . . Then she realized that the baby might be strapped down . He was almost there ; he was going to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the glade as danger , the dark woods as safety , but Hilary would n't be safe until he reached town ; they could still overtake him in the woods with his awkward burden , unless Peter could detain them . How long could he hold them ? And how were she and Peter going to get away after Hilary had gone ? For the first time in hours she allowed herself ' the luxury of speculating on the possibility of her own survival . Hilary was not more than three feet away from the trees when it happened . How long the man had been there , Kate did n't know ; he seemed to materialize out of the night , like one of the dark spirits the coven worshiped . She reproached herself bitterly for her fastidiousness ; if she had concentrated on the full glories of the final orgy , she would have realized that the paired couples came out evenly . Too evenly . There were thirteen members of the coven . One of them had slipped away earlier . She might have anticipated his identity even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wearing a particularlygruesome costume  --  that of a phosphorescent skeleton , realistically articulated , painted on black cloth . His mask , a cowl-like head covering , was thrown back over his shouldersfor better visibility . He extended one foot and Hilary went sprawling . The basketflew out of his hands and landed , on its side , several feet beyond his outflung , clutching hands . Kate heard the cry clearly this time , and it was the worst moment of a day which had not been precisely pleasant . Hilary 's reflexes were normally superb ; tonight they were superhuman . He was up again , staggering but deadly , at once . He turned on Martin , fists clenched , and rocked to a halt . Martin had stepped back . He had a gun . Not a rifle , a hand weapon of some kind . Kate could n't see it clearly , but Hilary could . His broad shoulders sagged and his face went gray . " Martin ! " Peter 's voice rang out . " Drop it or I 'll shoot  --  him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if he would be able to carry out his threat ; and she wondered whether Martinhad noticed the almost imperceptible hesitation . " Go ahead , " Martin said . " I mean it . " Peter 's finger contracted . He meant it , all right , but that did n't mean he would enjoy it . Kate wished passionately that she had the gun . She would have cheerfully rid the world of Mark , even without the additional reward of sparing Peter the sin of fratricide . " Go ahead , " Martin repeated . He laughed aloud ; the merry , confident sound made the hair on Kate 's neck bristle . " I 'd planned to kill him myself ; I 'd be delighted to have you save me the trouble . " Mark had been a silent , interested spectator . Now , knowing that he was immune for at least the length of time it took Peter to figure out his next move , he turned , shoving Tiphaine out of the way with a careless brutality that sent her sprawling . He pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell are you doing , Martin ? "  | " Completing the sacrifice , " Martin said coolly . " You never should have been the head . You cheated me out of my rights . Now I 'm taking them back . The others do n't give a damn , they 'll follow whoever 's in control . Go on , Stewart ; kill him . When you do , I 'll dispose of this interfering young bastard . " Peter stood motionless , his finger still on the trigger . Kate knew he was gripped by the same sick awareness of failure that turned her knees to water . Clearly Peter knew how to handle a gun ; but the two vital targets were too widely separatedto be covered simultaneously . If he shot Mark , Martin would kill Hilary , and the threat Peter had held over the rest of the coven would be canceled . She knew she could n't reach Martin without his hearing her ; there were too many dried , fragile objects underfoot , and the glade was too quiet . Once again she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small animal caught in a trap . She turned , in an instinctive response that made her forget her logic . The crash of the rifle sounded like a bomb in the stillness . Kate 's hands flew to her ears ; she turned dazed eyes toward the Devil 's Pulpit , expecting to see Mark sway and fall . But Mark stood firm on his feet , as surprised as she was . Martin was down , flat on the ground ; Peter had fired at him , not at Mark . His hands were empty , but his arms were moving , groping like separately animated , detached limbs , for the gun he had dropped . Hilary , on hands and knees , was scrabbling wildly among the leaves . The rifle went off again , and Kate spun around . Peter had fired at Volz , at close range , and missed . The two men stood braced , arms raised , struggling for the weapon . Volz was an obscene , half-naked troglodyte , but the muscles in his squat arms and shoulders were well developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went over backward , landing with a thud that knocked most of the breath out of him ; the rest of it came out in a grunt as Volz 's stocky body fell across him . The rifle went flying ; and Kate , after an agonizedappraisal of the situation , dived for it . As her fingers closed over the smooth , silkily polished woodp216of the stock , it occurred to her that she did n't have the faintest idea how to fire it . The thought was fleeting ; she bounded to her feet , raising the weapon in the only way that was comprehensibleto her then . The butt came crashing down on the back of Volz 's round head with a noise that would recur to her , in dreams , for some years to come . At the time it did n't bother her in the slightest . The general slumped to one side , his hands sliding off Peter 's throat , and Kate saw Peter staring up at her . His eyes were wide and unblinking ; and for a second her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his forehead trickled down into one eye , and he blinked . He staggered to his feet and reached for the gun . In the brief seconds which had elapsed , Hilary 's situation had deteriorated . He had the gun , and Martin lay motionless , dead or unconscious , but another danger was creeping up on him from behind as he stood staring down at the doctor . Mark had vanished from the rock earlier ; Kate had noted it subconsciously , thinking it was typical of Mark ; he had a well-developed sense of self-preservation . She had underestimatedhim . To save his position of power he would take a risk , so long as it was n't too big a risk . Kate let out a yell of warning , and Peter threw the rifle to his shoulder . Hilary whirled . He handled the pistol awkwardly , as if he had never used one before ; but at that range he did n't have to be experienced . Mark was diving at him when he pulled the trigger . The slim , darkly gleaming figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkwardly . Peter lowered the rifle ; his arm moved stiffly , all in one piece , like a stick of wood . Hilary looked wildly from the huddledbody at his feet , to the gun in his hand , to Peter . Then he dropped the gun , and ran . Kate heard his crashing , invisibleprogress stop momentarily and then go on ; he had collectedwhat he had come to get . Then , and only then , did she remember the others . Miss Device , Senator Blankenhagen of Alabama , Mrs. Adams . . . But when she turned to look for them , they were gone . Thep217fire burned low in the center of a quiet forest glade , empty except for the crumpled dead , and herself , and Peter . " They 've faded away , " Peter said , interpreting her look . His voice was flat . " Respectability triumphs after all . " He put the rifle carefully down on the ground , moving like a tired old man , and walked slowly across the glade . Kate followed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " There was no amusement in Peter 's voice , or face . Going down on one knee , he extended his hand and rolled the still body over onto its back . Mark had been shot through the center of the forehead  --  an astonishing shot for an inexperienced marksman . It was a small , neat hole , so neat that it looked unreal , like a painted caste mark , or symbol of the cult . The mask had dropped away in his fall ; the tumbled fair hair , so much like Peter 's , gleamed golden in the dying firelight . His face looked very young . He was smiling slightly . Lucifer might have appeared in such a form to those who envisioned him as the fallen angel , the morning star ; the prince  --  of darkness , perhaps  --  but princely nonetheless . " Godlike shapes and forms , excellinghuman , princely dignities . . . She was not moved to mourn for him , though ; relief was the strongest emotion she was conscious of feeling . Peter 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up . With the tip of his shoe , gently but finally , he turned the body over again so that the beautiful face and staring eyes were hidden . There was some sign of emotion in his face now ; but it was an emotion which twisted his mouth into a wry shape , and the bitterness in his voice , when he spoke , transformed the gracious words into a sardonic epitaph . " And flocks of angels sing thee to thy rest . ' But , do you know  --  I have my doubts . " Kate reached out for him , but she was too late . He fell like a log , face down among the crackling leaves.  |p218In  the dead light of a gray dawn , the glade looked forlorn and unreal . Kate shivered in the bitter air . The wind had died , leaving swollen gray clouds huddling in the sky . It felt like winter . The neat brown-and-tan uniforms of the state troopers looked out of place . As they moved about , talking in low voices , she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consternation . They had n't believedany of the story when they first heard it , even though it came from three separate , hitherto respectable , sources . They believed it now . Kate wrapped her arms around her body and tried to keep her teeth from chattering . She had warm , clean clothes , but her body ached from lack of sleep and she felt slimy and unclean . A long hot bath . . . She turned the idea over in her mind , luxuriously and longingly . Later , maybe . Later there would be time for other things . But first the explanations had to be made . The dead had to be buried . And the living had to be tended . She looked anxiously at Peter . He was seemingly quite composed as he stood talking to the lieutenant in charge . Someone 's borrowed overcoat , several inches too long , was thrown over his shoulders , andp219his left arm was in a sling . Now that his face was comparativelyclean , its pallor was more evident , and the assorted bruises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was going to break down . His collapseearlier that night had been temporary ; she had gotten him on his feet without too much trouble , and he had walked unaided down the path to the bridle trail . But he walked like a somnambulist , and she knew that he was only partially aware of what he was doing . He was only responding because it was easier than being nagged . Mentally she was in much the same condition , too numbed by successive shocks to think of anything except the immediateneed . And that need was simple . Escape . Get away . Abandonthe whole hideous mess , and find a quiet corner to hide in . The night was dark , with only starlight to guide them . Kate turned automatically into the wider expanse of the bridle path and had taken several dragging steps before she saw the faint light glinting off the chrome trim of a dark bulk in the middle of the path . It was Volz 's car . How the others had come , and gone , she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim it . She got Peter into the car , where he sat slumped and staring , and found , as she ought to have expected , that the keys were not in the ignition . They would be in Volz 's pocket . A shudder ran through her at the thought of retracing her steps and searching for then . She would rather walk , impossibleas that prospect now seemed . Then it occurred to her that Hilary might have an extra key  --  some people kept one in one of those little cases under the hood . Wearily she dragged herself out from under the wheel and  --  found it . She was back in the car , inserting the key into the ignition , when the long-delayed reaction struck . She fell forward against the wheel , hands clenched around the slippery plastic , and felt the heavy circle shiver with the spasms of her body . At her side Peter stirred and reached out for her . SheP220transferred her frantic grip from the steering wheel to his shoulders , and went on shivering . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Peter 's heart under her right ear was the most satisfactory sound she had ever heard , all the more so because there had been moments when she never expected to hear it again . As the shivering subsided , she realized that she was clinginglike a vine and clutching like a limpet , and making disgusting , feeble noises . It was n't fair ; he had undergone justas great an emotional shock as she , and had taken considerably more physical punishment . No , it was n't fair . . . but it felt absolutely heavenly . . . . Her mind wandered off into thoughts she would have been ashamed to say aloud ; and becauseMilton had been on her mind ( " Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven , " ) she was reminded of the maddening words he had put into the mouth of Eve . " God is thy law ; thou mine ; to know no more is woman 's happiest knowledge and her praise , ' " she muttered . " ' He for God only , she for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his normal voice . " What brought that on ? It 's the last sentimentI ever expected to hear from you . " " You might know a man wrote it . Oh , God , I 'm so tired . " " Not surprising . " " How are you ? " " Tired . " " Am I hurting you ? " " Your head , " said Peter literally , " seems to be right on top of that hole in my back . No , do n't move . I guess it 's worth it . " " We 've got to move . We ca n't stay here all night . " " Let go of me , then . " " I ca n't . I 'm afraid to . I 'm afraid I 'm dreaming , and that if I wake up you 'll be gone . " " Do n't start , " Peter said harshly . " If either one of us begins with that sort of thing , we 'll be babbling for hours . Do you want me to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell away ; butp221they lingered , in passing , long enough to take any possible sting from his last speech . " No , I 'd better drive . " After a few minutes she wished she had let him take the wheel . He might be in poorer physical condition , but he could n't possibly have done worse , even in his sleep . She felt sure she was hitting every rut and hole in the path ; they were both jolted around like ice cubes in a cocktail shaker . The path across the field was n't much better , but at last she bumped the car onto the highway and pressed down on the gas pedal . Peter roused himself and asked , " Where are we going ? " " I do n't know , " Kate said blankly , lifting her foot . " Your friendly local constable wo n't believe a word of this . Where 's the nearest state-police barracks ? " " Will they believe it ? " " They will when they see what 's back there , " Peter said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive of fifteen or twenty miles , and it took Kate a full forty minutes . She drove like someone who has been drinking , not enough to make him drunk , just enough to be unreliable and yet to be aware of his unreliability . She parked the car , illegally , by the steps of the barracks , and turned to look at Peter . The brief interlude of darkness and silence was over . Now she would have to relive those moments in retelling them . He returned her look of panic with a faint smile and a shrug . " Take a deep breath , " he said , and opened the car door . As soon as they went through the door , Kate knew that the way had been paved for them . The sound of a baby yelling burst out at them like a siren . At any other time she would have laughed at the look on the face of the young trooper who was holding the squawling bundle over his shoulder . " A bachelor , obviously , " said Kate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool had abandoned him ; - he did n't ask who she was , or blink at her fantastic appearance . He dropped the bundle into her arms as if it had been red hot , and wiped his brow on his sleeve.  | " It wo n't stop yelling , " he explained nervously . " What 's the matter with it ? " " Wet , hungry , and sleepy , " Kate said . She bounced the bundle experimentally and the yells subsided , though they did not die away completely . " It is n't hurt . It could n't make that much noise if it were . It is n't hurt . . . . " She sat down abruptly in the chair the trooper had vacated , clutching the baby tightly . It responded with an ungrateful squawl , and Kate started to rock back and forth . " I ca n't do anything about any of those things , " the trooper said unhappily . " You must have something I could tear up for a diaper. t Do n't you men sleep here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh . I guess so . " The boy 's face brightened at the prospect of handing over his job to a suitable female expert . He turned and caught sight of Peter , who was watching him with amusement ; and his face hardened into older lines . " What happened to you ? And the lady  --  she 's been in an accident , or something , too . " " Or something . It 's a long story , " Peter said . " Take us to your leader , or whatever you call him . " " There 's somebody with him now . If you 'll tell me  --  " " I think we 'd better join them , " Peter said , gently but inexorably . " It 's all part of the same  --  accident . " " What shall I do with this baby ? " Kate turned the unfortunateinfant around . " It 's a cute baby , " she said pensively . " How can you tell ? All I can see is its mouth  --  wide open . Hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lieutenant'sgoing out of his mind now . What 's one more baby ? " They found Hilary sitting beside the lieutenant 's desk . There were no bright lights ; but the air of disbelief was thick . Hilary looked up , startled , at their entrance , and his face broke into a broad white smile of sheer relief that made him look even younger than his eighteen years . " Man , " he said emphatically , " am I ever glad to see you ! " Kate did n't blame the lieutenant for being unhappy . Hep223was a wiry little man , older by some twenty years than many of the men under him , and the remnants of what had been a fine head of sandy hair were standing straight up by the end of the story . He did n't believe it , and he said as much , with amplification . Peter , who had narrated the tale in a concise , unemphatic manner  --  with only two small evasions of the truth  --  made no verbal rebuttal . He simply held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the effect was still convincing . Kate could n't imagine how he had managed to hold onto the rifle , much less get his finger around the trigger . The lieutenant breathed twice through his nose . " Better put something on those wrists , " he said , after a moment . " You , too , miss  --  er  --  Doctor . You look as if you could stand a little first aid yourself . " " What I need is a bath , " Kate said vigorously , " and I do n't think there 's time for that now . And Peter does n't need any first-aid nonsense either , what he needs is a doctor ; that wound in his back ought to be looked at , I do n't know what was on the point of that arrow , maybe poison , even , and  --  " " Poison ? Arrow ? " The lieutenant 's face turned red . " Lady . Please do n't say anything else . We 'll go out to the woods , where you said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that , can I ? " " I 'm going to take Dr. More home first , " Peter said . " She needs warmer clothing . We 'll meet you there . " " And for pity 's sake , " Kate added , transferring the bundle from one aching shoulder to the other , " Let me do something with this baby ! " The lieutenant knew a woman in town who would take care of the baby temporarily . Kate watched it depart , still howling , over the arm of the trooper who had been designatedfor this task . She was already forming vague plans for the child ; such a dramatic beginning to its life merited consideration , if not atonement . Besides , it had provided the only light touch , and a badly needed one , in the whole horribleaffair . Hilary Jackson , who had listened to Peter 's version of thep224happening with magnificent composure , was not so easy to dispose of . Peter insisted that he be sent home , and the lieutenantwas equally determined to keep him . Hilary broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to being detained ; he would , he remarked , feel a hell of a lot better with some good thick bars between him and the outside world . Bars , he pointed out , kept people out in addition to keeping them in . Peter nodded thoughtfully . " You 've got a definite point . For the next few hours , at least . I wish I could emulate you . " " Yeah , " Hilary said unemphatically . The two men contemplated one another in silence for a moment , Hilary looking down from his magnificent height . They shook hands in frowning silence , and Peter turned on his heel and marched out . Men , Kate thought disgustedly . She held out her hand . " He might at least have said Thanks , ' " she said . " Hilary . . . later , when this is finished  --  " " Forget it . " He grinned , suddenly and charmingly , and the big hand tightened around hers so vigorously that she barely repressed a squeal of pain . " You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , as she stood shivering in the cold light of the glade , she tried to concentrate on memories like that , and not on the things that lay , broken and abandoned , on the ground . The lieutenant was converted ; one look at Mark 's grotesque mask , and the tattered remnants of the other costumes , was enough . Watching his face , which had lost much of its normalruddy color , Kate wished passionately that she could remainwhere she was , detached , an observer . But she had to know what was going to happen . And she had to be near Peter when he spoke of his brother . " I just ca n't believe it , " the lieutenant was saying , as she approached . " The most influential people in the whole damn town . . . Damn it , Stewart , I ca n't arrest people likep225the Senator , not on this charge . Witchcraft ! I think they repealedthe law a few years back . " " I do n't give a damn what you do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose . . . . But Dr. More is not without influence herself , you know . At the very least these people must be made to resign from any positions of responsibility they now hold . " " Particularly Miss Device and the Foundling Home , " Kate said . " But people got killed , " the lieutenant said helplessly . " I still have n't got that straight . Who the hell killed who ? " " I 'm the only available arrestee , " Peter said calmly . " I shot Martin . Delightful thought , " he added . " He did it to save the baby , " Kate said . " And Hilary . " " Yeah , the Jackson kid . " The lieutenant scratched his head . " How does he come into this ? " " He 's the hero , " Peter said . Only Kate , who had , in some odd way , memorized his every gesture and expression , observedthe slight narrowing of his eyes . " He saved us , and the child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brought the rifle ? " Kate , who had never played poker , barely repressed an exclamation . She still had an intellectual 's contempt for nonprofessionals ; she had to fight that , it led her into dangerous errors  --  such as assuming that the lieutenant 's bovine face concealed a brain of the same caliber . " He brought the rifle , " Peter agreed . " And gave it to me . " " Then your prints will be on it ? " " They already are on it , " Peter said impatiently . " I 've admitted killing Martin . What the hell are you trying to prove ? " " The facts . Only the facts . So you killed Martin . That would be after he shot the other guy  --  your  --  brother , you say ? " " Ca n't you leave him alone ? " Kate exploded . " He 's hurt and sick and he 's had a terrible shock . We told you what happened . And if you think he lied about something , you 're right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Kate rushed on . " Hep226did n't kill the general , I did ; I bashed his head in with the butt of that gun . You 'll find my prints on it too . I did it to keep him from strangling Peter , but I would have done it anyhow , he needed killing as much as Martin did , and if you think I 'm ashamed of it you 're crazy , I 'll stand right up and tell any judge and jury all about it , and furthermore  --  " Peter relaxed , his lips twitching , and the lieutenant literallythrew up his hands . " Okay , okay , okay ! Take it easy , will you , Doc ? " " And do n't call me Doc ! " " Sorry . Look , Doc  --  I mean , Miss More . I 'm not trying to railroad anybody . I just want to find out what happened . I knew there was something fishy ; after all these years I 've got so I can smell a lie . So now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's nice . But stupid . " " And superfluous , " Peter murmured . " She does n't need pro-tecting . " " You 're so right , " the lieutenant agreed . They exchanged a superior , masculine look , and Kate watched them tolerantly . Under her calm facade her brain was racing . Peter 's comment had been literally true ; he would n't insulther by such an idiotic lie . He was trying to protect someone , but not out of quixotic gallantry . Even if he was acquitted , Hilary Jackson would be irreparably damaged by being tried on a murder charge . And he was n't in the clear yet . Neither she nor Peter had been in any condition the night before to remember the one , indisputable piece of ' evidence which could bring Hilary before a jury . She forced her eyes from the one tolerable object in the clearing  --  Peter 's face  --  and glanced around . One of the troopers had found the rifle immediately ; it lay by Volz 's body , where Peter had dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been stowed away as part of the evidence . The other gun had not yet been found . They had n't really gotten around to looking for it yet , being pre/occupied with the human remains , and it was probably burieddeep in drifted leaves . She knew approximately where it must be  --  about six feet from the huddled shape of Mark 's body . Somehow she must force herself to go over there . And she would have to hurry . One of the troopers was kneeling by Mark , his hands questing through the leaves . While she was still thinking , Peter acted . " Lieutenant . Before you take him away . . . may I . . . ? " " Huh ? " The lieutenant looked from Mark 's body to Peter 's averted face and blinked . " Sure , " he said awkwardly . " Al , come over here . " Peter had also mentally marked the spot ; probably neither of them would ever forget the details of that night . When his dragging steps had brought him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee . Still kneeling , he covered his eyes with one hand ; the other trailed limply at his side , the fingers moving nervously . Kate saw the young man , Al , turn his head away . He must be new at the job . But Peter 's pose and bowed head were genuineenough to bring a quick sting of tears to her own eyes . When Peter got to his feet , amid a respectful silence , there was something in his right hand . He looked at it dazedly , and held it out toward the lieutenant . " Here 's the gun , " he said . The lieutenant yelped and leaped forward . " Damn it to hell ! Do n't you know better than to pick up evidence ? " " Sorry ; was n't I supposed to ? " Peter meekly surrendered the weapon . The lieutenant 's reply was heated . When his wrath died down , he gave Peter a look in which annoyance , respect , and a faint amusement were mingled . " Okay , Stewart , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess anything else up . I do n't need you any longer . Nor Miss More . " " Thank you , " Peter said gravely . " I 'll want to see you , probably later today . " The lieuten/ant sighed ; he looked not like a policeman but like a tired , middle-aged man with too many worries . " God , this is going to be a mess . . . . Where will you be ? " Peter hesitated . " Baltimore , " he said , after a moment . " I 'll call you when we 've found a hotel . " " Why Baltimore ? " Kate asked . " Do you want to go back to your place ? " " No . No , I do n't . " " Nor is the Middleburg Inn a happy choice , " Peter pointed out . " We need to get away from Middleburg , Lieutenant . We 'll let you know . " They walked side by side toward the path . In deference to Peter 's frowning abstraction Kate did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She knew what was coming , and knew that he hated it as much as she did . Sooner or later the question would have to be asked , but she could n't bring herself to ask it . They had taken Volz 's car ; it was still parked at the end of the path , and Kate got a sadistic , if illogical , satisfaction when she thought of the beating it had taken in the last twenty-four hours . Peter had taken over the driving as soon as they left the police barracks . She had questioned the wisdom of his drivingwith one arm and had received a stare of such silent outragethat she had n't raised the point again . This time , when he was behind the wheel , instead of starting the car , he turned to face her . " Tiphaine is at the house , " he said . " That 's why I do n't want you to go back there . You can buy a toothbrush in Bal-timore . " " Is she  --  " " Alive ? Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't stand euphemisms , not now . " " Schizophrenia , I guess that 's the technical term . She 's completely withdrawn ; sits , moves , stands on order , but does nothing by herself . She was well on the way before , Kate ; last night she went right on over the edge . "  | " I see . " " Not much else to say , is there ? " His arm over the back of the seat , Peter made no move to touch her . " I 've seen cases like hers before . The chance of recovery is not very good . " " I know . . . . What happened to her last night ? I forgot about her . Is n't that awful . . . . ? " " So did I. She must have gone into shock when Mark was killed . The police found her this morning , curled up like a worm , beside him . " " That 's why you insisted on stopping at the house before we came out here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asked him to get her out of the way before we got here . I did n't know what we 'd find , whether she 'd be alive , or dead or . . . But I did n't want you to see her . They got her away , through the woods , before we arrived . " He waited for a moment . Kate said nothing , only sat staringdown at the hands which lay lax on her knee . Peter started the car . When they were back on the highway , he said , " In a sense she 's the most tragic figure of all . I know how you must be feeling . . . . If that foul uncle of yours had n't gotten his hands on her . . . " I do n't know , " Kate said dully . " I just do n't know any longer . What about Mark ? You turned out all right . . . . Do n't sympathize with me , Peter . It 's just as bad for you as it is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , his eyes on the road . " It 's not my world which has fallen to pieces . Will you want to stay on here , do you think ? " " I do n't know . . . " It 's not all that different from the rest of the world , you know . Human beings are the one thing you ca n't run away from , and they 're pretty much alike . " He gave a short laugh . " Full of advice , are n't I ? I 'm sorry , I do n't really mean to sound so smug and omniscient . If you do n't want to go to Baltimore . . . " You have no idea , " Kate said , staring straight ahead , " how wonderful it is to have someone tell me what to do.  |p230But  it wo n't last , " she added wearily . " I 'm not the frail femaletype . I 'm bossy , and arrogant , and conceited ; I think I 'm smarter than most people , so I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his foot down on the brake . The car slid to a stop on the shoulder of the road , and he turned to face her . " I 'll risk it , " he said.
