Chicago 's black voters could help topple Mayor Richard J. Daley from Ills national power perch on November 5 . By refusing to vote in the Presidential election , Negroes could help throw Illinois to the Republicans , and Daley must deliver Illinois to Humphrey if he wants to maintain his party ranking . This is probably one of the most difficult assignments the veteran boss of Chicago has ever had to face . It is an intriguing thought , but , as the cats on the street would say , whitey 's got the brother in the trick bag again . The black voter in Chicago  --  and anywhere else , for that matter  --  has got to vote for Humphrey because there 's no place else to go . No matter how you add it up , the answer comes out the same . Use the old math of the rigidly controlled , survival-oriented Democratic machine and the conclusion is inescapable : blacks will come out for Humphrey on November 5 . Use the new math of the black militant spokesmen who are preaching a vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the answer remains unchanged : black voters will vote and they will vote Democratic . In Chicago , the black vote has long been locked into the Democratic machine . In the fantastic 1960 Presidential election , when John F. Kennedy took Illinois from Richard Nixon by less than 10,000 votes , here 's how a fewof Chicago 's black wards voted : The 2nd Ward cast 21,100 Democratic ballots and 5,353 Republican ; the 3rd Ward went for Kennedy 19,990 to 5,003 , and the 24th Ward gave Kennedy 24,211 votes to Nixon 's 2,131 . In any one of these three black wards  --  and others delivered returns almost as effective  --  the plurality was sufficient to swing the entire state of Illinois to the Democratic nominee . Four years ' later , when the specter of Sen. Barry Goldwater stirred Chicago 's black voters to a little movement on their own , the pluralities in these same districts were extraordinary . The 2nd Ward turned out 23,238 for Lyndon B. Johnson and 1,276 for Goldwater . In the 3rd Ward , the Republican candidate could muster only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24th Ward he got 304 to Johnson 's massive 21,662 . A lot has happened since 1964 . Rev. Martin Luther King , Jr. , was assassinated , his death putting an end to the nonviolent movement as a national force . Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was wiped off the political scene in the same unbelievable manner , and ' another hero of black Americans was eliminated . Cities burst into flame , Chicago among them . The black pride movement caught hold and suddenly black people started thinking for themselves  --  some of them , at least . In Chicago , one of these is Calvin Lockridge , who convened the Black Consortium , a confederation of about forty militant black organizations . When the conventions were over and the Presidential campaigns had begun to tick along , Lockridge startled blacks and whites alike by proposing a double-barreled anti-Establishment strategy He first called on blacks to vote for Wallace in an effort to throw the election into the House of Representatives . Starting from the assumption that neither Humphrey nor Nixon will offer a meaningful program for the liberation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal of the vote-for-Wallace strategy is to break the two-party system . The system is what is strangling black people . So if you think black people voting for Wallace is extreme , you 'd better know that we 'll do anything to destroy the system . " But Lockridge came to recognize that this approach is too sophisticated for the black masses , and he began calling instead for a boycott of the polls , a protest technique to be fashioned into a national strategy . A few ministers and independent politicians have joined the boycott movement in Chicago , seeking to persuade black voters that it is suicidal to keep on playing lackey to the Democrats . They argue that once the major parties know that the black vote is not automatic , meaningful bargaining can begin . Daley is being used ' as bait in the Chicago boycott attempt . Militants are saying that a nonvote is a vote against Daley , who is running for nothing except his political reputation , which took on national proportions during the bloodletting of the Democratic convention . But the boycott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor apparently in other urban areas . A major reason is the threat of Wallace and Nixon-Agnew . In their October 5th issue , the Chicago-South Suburban News , a Negro weekly , urged voters to defeat Wallace , while the Chicago Daily Defender , one of two Negro dailies in the country , inveighed against Nixon . The News strung a two-line banner headline across the top of its front page : " Black Voters Must Go to the Polls En Masse To Curb Wallace Fascist Threat . " The story , appearing just after hundreds of thousands turned out for Wallace 's visit to Chicago , said in part : - If it was not clear before , it became clear Monday afternoon in Chicago that black voters can not forgo the voting booth this year as various people have asked them to do . . . The situation one month before the election calls for some deep thinking on the part of black people in the state of Illinois and throughout the nation . There is a clear and present danger that George C. Wallace and his legions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country . Never before in the history of this country has the black vote individually or as a whole meant so much as it does this year . A vote not cast is a vote for Wallace . A vote for Wallace is a vote for a Fascist , Hitlerite America . Voicing much the same fear , of Nixon , the Defender said in an editorial : Though some of his strategists try to fashion him in the image of a new leader with a profound , sense of vision , Richard M. Nixon remains unchanged . . . Should he win the Presidency in November , the nation will be rocked by some of the most oppressive and repressive measures ever devised by an American President . The ominous change can be perceived through Nixon 's running mate , Governor ' Agnew , who is opposed to demonstrations of any kind and who advocates drastic limits to " permissive dissents . " We would be living not in a democratic state with a representative government to sustain the ideology but in a garrison state ' where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infnngement of their rights or an excessive use of power under the subterfuge of national interest . These are matters that the black voter must consider befote entering the voting booth . Assuming the boycott technique to be an effective one , which I do not , it must be worked at , like any other political device . It is not being worked at in Chicago because the militant-independent coalition lacks the means and the discipline to carry on a relentless , precinct-level , door-to-door-campaign . Therefore it can succeed only by a miracle . That is one reason why the black voter today is in a steel-lined bag , trying to get out with a can opener : a strong political organization is nonexistent in the black community , outside the Democratic machine . By contrast , the Daley machine continues to hum . Less than two months after the Chicago Mayor had zipped into his fourth term in April , 1967 , with a winning plurality of more than 500,000 votes , Negro Democratic officeholders from across the country assembled in Washington for a workshop conference . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its significance for Negroes in the party and for the Democratic Presidential nominee . It seems evident that even then.party leaders were concerned about holding onto the black bloc vote . Most delegates to that Democratic parley no doubt went home determined that the message brought by state Rep. Corneal A. Davis , a veteran ChiCago Dem &rat,; was the rallying call for the - days ahead : " The Negro 's salvation is organization . We 've got-to be organized . We must be part of an organization . We can not stand alone . " Then the June , 1968 , primaries came to Chicago and produced one of the lowest turn-outs in /recent history . In the black wards , the stay-at-homes were so numerous as to be alarming . The white vote was down about 30 per cent , but among blacks it was about half of what it had been in the 1964 primary . A. A. ( Sammy ) Rayner , who got into Chicago 's City Council by unseating a regular Democratic organization man , failed to oust Rep , William Lt. , Dawson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small turn-out , disagreeing with those who argued ' that the death of Sen-ator Kennedy caused black voters to stay away from the polls : " We thought Senator Kennedy 's death would actually enhance the vote . I think . Negroes may be becoming disillusioned with the political , process . If that 's so , I 'm very concerned . " Leon M. Despres , the white independent councilman known for his maverick ways , concluded that " people are voting with their feet . They feel alienated , uninvolved , rejected . " The low turn-out , Despres said , was " an eloquent but ominous sign for the fabric of the city . " But Daley is as sensitive to such signs as a mechanic who detects a foreign sound in the motor of his beloved machine . At once the screwdrivers and pliers were playing over the innards of the Democratic political mechanism , looking for short circuits , points that needed adjusting , plugs to be replaced . For the machine needed a perfect tune-up for the race on November 5 . Now , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is again heard in Chicago 's black wards . The 3rd Ward is a good example . Ralph H. Metcalfe , one-time Olympic hero , is alderman and Democratic committeeman of the ward . Chairman of the powerful , Building and Zoning Committee of the City Council and an astute politician , he is thought by many to be the heir apparent to the Congressional seat of the aging Dawson . " Certainly we see the vote boycott as a threat , " Metcalfe said . " It will continue to be a threat so long as we do not address ourselves to it . But we are pointing out that any person who advocated that black people refrain from voting is no friend of the race . " Metcalfe says that , in view of the threatened boycott , his organization has stepped up its campaign for Humphrey . " We advanced our timetable considerably . Our precinct captains are getting vote estimates much earlier this year , so we can get an idea of what the picture is . And we are making it crystal clear to residents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Metcalfe predicts that a larger percentage of Negro voters will turn out on November 5 than did in 1964 . The NAACP , , the Urban League and some labor organizations are also conducting vigorous " nonpartisan " get-out-the-vote campaigns . The A. Philip Randolph Institute has come out in support of Humphrey-Muskie and is actively opposing the boycott in Chicago and other major cities . One flier which the institute distributed to blacks speaks a plain language : " Nixon and Agnew and Wallace scream about ' law and order ' and ' crime in the streets . ' Whom do you think they have in mind ? It 's us . What do you think they really mean ? They mean to scare the Southern racists and Northern backlashers into voting for them so they can ' put the nigger in his place . ' " That is very effective propagandizing . Combined with the bread-and-butter campaigning of the Democratic organization 's precinct captains , it will get the black voters to the polls on November 5 , although there is enormous ' hostility to Humphrey in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President much as they view the NAACP : great in its day but unable or unwilling to shift with the times . " What am I supposed to do ? " one black voter asked . " Sit on the sidelines and watch the world go by ? Obviously , I ca n't vote for Nixon . The votefor-Wallace bit is too silly even to talk about . So that leaves me with Humphrey . We 're in a bag , brother . " 396 Another group of blacks who will vote for Humphrey , though it goes against their militant grain , are those who have fought in Chicago 's political wars , have been run over by the machine , but who are still looking for somewhere to turn . Bennett J. Johnson is one such . Though he is now project director of the Milwaukee Urban League 's Labor Education Adancement Program , he is in and out of Chicago and very much a part there of the independent political scene . Still nettled because he was offered $3,000 to drop out of Chicago 's 42nd Ward aldermanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference in Philadelphia that he offered to withdraw his candidacy if his political enemies gave him $1 for every black man , woman and child in America . " I ran and I lost , " Johnson recalls . " The campaign cost the 42nd Ward regular Democratic Organization $35,000 to defeat ine . But we built the North Side contingent of the Chicago League of Negro Voters which led every protest movement for the next nine years . " Johnson said he could have become a political dropout and " it would have made sense to some people if I had joined the boycott movement . " But to him it just is n't that simple . " Politics is power . The acquisition of this power is. a science . We who believe that black people must control our own communities must first learn how to become skilled at this ' craft . Then we must use this science to free ourselves and our brothers . " Johnson then put his finger on the core of the dilemma . " The most influential organization in Chicago and many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group or a civil rights organization . It is the Democatic Party . The warp and woof of ithe Democratic Party are the precinct captains and the functionaries such as election judges . But these black party faithful do not come from the middle class ; they are not the black bourgeoisie . They are the grass-roots ? people who have found some identity and some way to make a living through the political organization . " To launch a program to exterminate them , Johnson said , would be fratricide and would leave a vacuum of employment and service " we are not prepared to fill . " To put it another way , the Democratic organization in Chicago and in many urban centers is a way of survival for many Negroes . At the same time , because the organization does not respond to the needs of the black man , it is also a way of death for the hopes and dreams and aspirations of a people . There , again , is the bag that engulfs black voters on the eve of the 1968 Presidential election . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Humphrey is a vote for the machine . Ironically ; the three black candidates currently running for President are virtually forgotten in the whirl and swirl of electioneering . Ask any black man who they are and he 'll be able to name Dick Gregory  --  perhaps . Eldridge Cleaver , the Black Panthers ' minister of information , who is running on the Peace and Freedom ticket , and the Communist Party 's Charlene Mitchell have not stirred even as much interest in Chicago as Dick Gregory 's camTHE isiNnoNIOctober 21,1968 paign " dollar bills . " The number of blacks who will waste their votes on these three candidates will not even ripple the political waters . And so , giVen the widespread belief that the Democrats will be hard put to carry Illinois ' for Humphrey , I return to the intriguing thought that Chicago 's black voters could help push Daley off his pinnacle of power on November 5 . From emotion , militancy and impulsiveness they just might indulge themselves in this kind of orgy of revenge . But , more in self-defense than anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in Humphrey 's pocket . Whether or not it will be enough to put him over most black voters are convinced that they are better off in somebody 's corner than to find themselves even more stranded than they are today . Richard H. Newhouse , a black state Senator from Chicago who bucked the machine to win his seat , has been preaching a bit of Black Power to his colleagues in the Illinois General Assembly . Like Bennett Johnson , he sees politics as power and is trying to weld black state Representatives and Senators into a power bloc . " The time has come , " Newhouse said last year , " when the Negro voter must recognize that voting is not an exercise in futility . Good , clean , legal American power is within grasp  --  if we just remember to stretch forth our hand . " He is not having much success with his unity program . In time and under the right circumstances , Newhouse 's admonition could have great meaning . Under the circumstances of the upcoming election , the black man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Chicago and across the nation , he is going to act on his franchise , he is going to stretch forth his hands . But what ' the political system is going to drop into those upturned palms will not be " good , clean , legal American power . "
