Ailing A.F.L.-C.I.O . President George Meany limped painfully* to the lectern . <P> There , jowls aquiver with indignation , he roared at a union convention in Washington : " We ca n't buy either party . If we are looking around for a party to adopt or control , we do n't want the Democratic Party , because they ca n't deliver ! " President Johnson was un moved . " As far as I have been aware , " he said laconically , " labor has always been independent , and should be . " <P> Sitting on Situs . Nonetheless , Meany 's blast brought the smoldering feud between labor and the Democratic Party close to open warfare . Already irked by the Administration 's tepid efforts to win repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act 's Section 14(b) , labor 's No. 1 legislative goal for the 89th Congress , union tempers were raised to boiling point last week by the House 's failure to act on another measure eagerly sought by the unions . Stalled in committee was a bill that would over turn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one employer at all entrances to a construction site where several employers are at work , on grounds that this amounts to a secondary boycott . <P> One reason for the so-called " situs " bill 's failure to clear Adam Clayton Powell 's Education and Labor Committee is that it would chiefly benefit the construction trades unions , which have been notoriously reluctant to admit Negroes . In addition , though the bill has more than enough votes for passage , House Democrats have decided to leave it in committee until the Senate acts . Reason : Democrats from conservative districts feel that they lost votes unnecessarily by supporting the 14 ( b ) repeal bill only to have the Senate filibuster it to death . <P> Love Call . Labor 's inability so far to win passage of a single major bill that it sought from the 89th Congress attests to its diminishing influence on Capitol Hill and at the polls . Moreover , for all their outcries , the unions are in the curious position of demanding cooperation from the Administration while giving none in return . Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wage-price hikes be held to a noninflationary 3.2% a year . In current negotiations alone , the International Association of Ma chinists is asking the nation 's major airlines for a 15% increase , Denver ironworkers want 15.7% , Kansas City carpenters are asking 10% , Albuquerque bricklayers want 19% , and Baton Rouge operating engineers 17.5% . <P> More from habit than necessity , the Democrats made a token effort to woo labor last week . Showing up for the final session of the construction trades union convention , Vice President Humphrey shouted buoyantly to the 4,000 delegates : " We Democrats need the labor movement . The President of the United States is your friend , and we are not going to let you down ! " But even that ardent love call brought no more than a few tepid claps from the disgruntled labor leaders . <P> <P> * In Manhattan at week 's end Meany underwent an arthroplasty operation to ease the pain in his arthritic right hip joint , a disability that has forced him to use a cane for several years .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
