When Irving Williams discusses Washington as a " transition environment , " he is not talking politics . " The hot , muggy nights bring on fungus and disease , " says Williams ; yet the winters are neither cold nor wet enough for northern grass . As head gardener of the White House , Williams solves the problem by planting K31 fescue on the South Lawn and a mixture of bluegrass and fescue on the North Lawn , which faces Pennsylvania Ave . <P> Though most voters have the impression that a new President inherits a virtually empty Executive Mansion , hundreds of specialists remain , no matter what the Administration . For years Williams and his six-man detail have sown the turf , sprayed the elms and broadcast electronic squawks through a loudspeaker system to keep off the starlings and sparrows . The gardeners and more than 300 other permanent White House staff members-from Steve Martini , the executive barber since 1952 , to White House Upholsterer Larry Arata-are likely to be staying on after Jan. 20 . <P> There is no statutory permanent staff at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive in the 132-room mansion without its nonpartisan hired help . Thus , White House Calligrapher Sandy Fox will doubtless be busy scrawling banknote script on thousands of invitations for Nixon state dinners , as he has since the early days of John Kennedy 's Administration , and Curator James Ketchum will continue to watch over the White House art and china collections . <P> Although many will be departing with their bosses , some secretaries will remain . Last week Lyndon Johnson gathered them to express his gratitude for their labors and present each with a charm bearing the presidential seal . <P> One Bequest . The dominant figure on the permanent White House staff is Executive Assistant William J. Hopkins , 58 , a bald , self-effacing factotum who joined Herbert Hoover in 1931 , and has been the presidential office manager since 1943 . Hopkins commands a crew of 255 secretaries , stenographers , messengers and telephone operators . He is , says Lyndon Johnson , " an indispensable instrument " to the management of the presidency . <P> <P> Lady Bird has already introduced Pat Nixon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who presides over some 70 cooks , butlers , maids , elevator operators , electricians and carpenters . Under his overall supervision are five housemen who constantly wax and buff the floors ; a full-time window cleaner who has 147 windows and eight skylights to cope with ; and three flower arrangers who keep busy adorning the twelve guest rooms . After 27 years of White House ceremonies-including J.F.K. 's funeral and Lynda Bird 's wedding-West says with equanimity : " We never have crises . " <P> <P> Besides the workers who will be staying on , the Nixons may inherit another White House regular . Blanco , the President 's sometimes shy and nervous white collie , has finally grown accustomed to the grounds , and L.B.J. is hesitant to transplant him to the nontransitional environment of Texas .
