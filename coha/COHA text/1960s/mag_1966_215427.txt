Palace and hovel , ships , torches , caves , rocky passes , thunderstorms , primeval forest , a chorus of " unborn children . " The whole idea for a new opera called Die Frau ohne Schatten ( The Woman Without a Shadow ) so excited Richard Strauss that he wanted to be gin composing right on the spot . That was in 1911 . It was eight years , however , before the shadow became a reality , and then , despite wide critical acclaim , it was 40 years more before it was staged in the U.S. Trouble was , with all those ships and rocky passes , the technical demands of the fanciful libretto were more than most opera houses could handle , especially the matchbox confines of Manhattan 's old Met . Now , with a new stage that could accommodate the Punic Wars , the Met has finally mounted its first production of Die Frau ohne Schatten . <P> <P> MGM Sunrise . Produced last week , it was the most lavish spectacle ever conjured by the Met , a triumph in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from big-scale to boffo . In Antony and Cleopatra , the scenery outweighed the music . La Traviata , Verdi 's melancholy masterpiece , was buoyed by the stylish performances of Anna Moffo and Robert Merrill . La Gioconda , an en dearing old war horse , came vibrantly alive in an opulent but refreshingly conventional production , beautifully sung by Renata Tebaldi and Franco Corelli . <P> But nothing approached Die Frau ohne Schatten . Poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal 's libretto requires a primer course in the mythology of six cultures in order to be fathomed , moves murkily between the spirit world , the human world of an impoverished dyer and his sensuous wife ( Baritone Walter Berry and Soprano Christa Ludwig ) , and the go-between world of an emperor and his wife ( Tenor James King and Soprano Leonie Rysanek ) . The empress , alas , is without a shadow-she can not bear children-and with the aid of a Mephistophelean nurse ( Mezzo-Soprano Irene Dalis ) she attempts to divest the dyer 's wife of her shadow with promises of riches . In the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties are appeased , and the two couples are elevated into an MGM sunrise , singing their heads off . <P> Flies to Flies . The plot evolves , or rather meanders , in a kind of metaphysical Disneyland setting thick with mountainous stalactites and stalagmites , behind , over and under which lurk new magical wonders to behold . Fog billows , backdrops quaver with psychedelic patterns , a sword springs from nowhere , an orange fountain gushes from center stage , a tenor flies into the flies . The singing , which requires a display of vocal acrobatics that few performers can successfully negotiate , was excellent . Loudest bravas went to Christa Ludwig , whose lusty soprano and hip-swinging histrionics had bite and conviction . <P> <P> What saved the opera from its pretentious libretto was the soaring music of Strauss , conducted with thunderous brilliance by the late composer 's gifted friend , Karl Bohm . By turns raging and receding , mischievous and mystical , the orchestration powerfully underscored the mysterious gulfs between the two worlds and buttressed each role with bold , contrasting shades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Die Frau was symphonic opera music-and Metropolitan Opera-at its best .
