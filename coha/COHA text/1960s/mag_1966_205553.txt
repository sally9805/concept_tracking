At the outset , the 1966 campaign in the East seemed to presage danger for incumbents of both parties . Pundits and pollsters alike heralded the political demise of New York 's Republican Gover nor Rockefeller , foresaw some uncertainties in the futures of Massachusetts ' Governor Volpe , New Hampshire 's Democratic Governor John King and New Jersey 's Republican Senator Case . As a result , edgy incumbents in the twelve Eastern states fought like Trojans . And , instead of a year to " Throw the Rascals Out , " 1966 wound up as the year in which Eastern voters decided overwhelmingly to " Keep ' Em In . " <P> In 14 of the region 's 16 contests for Governor and the U.S. Senate , satisfied voters returned old familiar faces - or reasonable facsimiles - to old familiar jobs . And both parties pretty well held their own . <P> Vote of Confidence . Solid victories were awarded to such veterans as Volpe ( 63% of the vote ) , Case ( 62% ) , Maine 's doughty three-term G.O.P. Senator Margaret Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boggs ( 60% ) , and West Virginia 's Democratic Senator Jennings Randolph ( 59% ) . Youngish up-and-comers also were rewarded with renewed votes of confidence . Vermont 's Governor Philip Hoff , 42 , elected in 1962 as the state 's first Democratic chief executive since 1854 , got a 57% majority this year ; ticket-splitting Rhode Island voters re-elected Democratic Senator Claiborne Pell , 47 , with a 67% margin and also returned energetic Republican Governor Chafee , 44 , by a 64% total . <P> Connecticut Democrats , led by Governor John Dempsey , wound up retaining every statewide office and all but one congressional seat . New Hampshire 's King , who in 1962 became the state 's first Democratic Governor in 39 years , won an unprecedented third two-year term - thanks in part to a continuing squabble within the G.O.P. Demo cratic Senator Thomas Mclntyre easily trounced his super-hawkish opponent , retired Brigadier General Harrison Thyng , a World War II and Korean flying ace who had financial backing from such outstate hyperconservatives as Texas Millionaire H. L. Hunt . <P> Freshmen 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ily defeated spendthrift Millionaire Mil ton Shapp - and that , too , represented a victory for the incumbent regime , since Shafer had served for four years as Lieutenant Governor in the popular ad ministration of outgoing Governor Scranton . Indeed , Pennsylvania voters ' reaffirmation was vigorous enough to regain Republican control of both houses of the legislature by a hair . In Maryland , even though Republican Ted Agnew came from behind to defeat Segregationist George Mahoney in the gubernatorial campaign , voters also seemed content with the status quo , re-electing Democrats to all other statewide offices and keeping the state legislature lopsidedly Democratic . <P> In the East 's congressional races , the Republican resurgence was notably less dramatic than elsewhere . The 1964 Goldwater debacle deposed 16 Eastern Republican House members ; last week the G.O.P. picked up only seven seats in 122 House elections . All but three of the Democrats ' celebrated ' 64 freshmen were sent back to Capitol Hill .
