Wilson , Secretary of Defense under President Dwight D. Eisenhower , died today at his plantation home near here . The 71-year-old former president of the General Motors Corporation died in his sleep at about 2:30 A. M. He was alone in the three-story house . Dr. C. S. Toler , coroner of East Feliciano Parish ( County ) , attributed death to a coronary thrombosis . Mr. Wilson 's term as Defense Secretary under President Eisenhower was full of personal crises , many brought about by his free-flowing oratory . One phrase that got him in trouble was his statement about General Motors and the United States . It went in part : " What 's good for General Motors is good for the country . " Mr. Wilson always said that this was taken out of context . He headed General Motors for eleven years and under his leadership the automobile concern was converted into the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 12,000,000,000 in war equipment to the United States and its allies from 1941 to 1945 .

Mrs. Wilson with whom he was supposed to have his golden wedding anniversary next month , remained in Michigan and his son returned to Michigan a few days ago . Also surviving are two Other sons , Thomas Erwin Wilson and Charles Erwin Wilson Jr. , who live . in the Detroit area , and three daughters , Mrs. E. C. Matthews and Mrs. William B.

Friday at Christ Church Cranbrook , Bloomfield Hills , Mich , Burial will be in Acacia Park Cemetery . Wide Initial Approval " Engine Charlie " Wilson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial approval . There was some partisan sniffing at the President 's choice of so many big-business executives for high echelon posts ? " seventeen millionaires and one plumber . " Yet it seemed logical that ? Mr. Wilson , having headed America 's largest corporation , General Motors , would be fit to tackle the Government 's biggest department . Mr. Wilson was applauded for selfless patriotism in giving up a e600,000-a-year job to take on at modest pay the appalling problems of national defense . This sunny climate of approval vanished almost before the Wilsons were settled in Washington . The Senate uncovered an old law , passed in Civil War days , prohibiting officials from holding stock in companies doing business with the Government . Mr. Wilson , who knew next to nothing about the motives and workings of the political world , bridled when Senators demanded that he dispose of nearly 40,000 shares of General Motors stock worth nearly $2 , - 500,000 at then current prices . At confirmation hearings , Mr. Wilson 's round , heavily jowled face wore a look of perpetual outrage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In a story leaked from a closed committee hearing , Mr. Wilson was quoted as saying : " What 's good for General Motors is good for the country . " This was broadcast throughout the country as an example of Mr. Wilson 's " arrogance . " Record Showed Difference Actually , he never said it that way . The printed record of the hearing reveals this exchange : Senator Robert C. Hendrickson , Republican of New Jersey : " If a situation did arise where you had to make a decision extremely adverse . . to the company , in the interest of the United States Government , could you make that decision ea Mr. Wilson : " Yes sir , I could . can not conceive of one because for years I thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors , and vice versa . " It was the three ambiguous words " and vice versa " that got him in trouble . They were dropped in carelessly , presumably to round out a sentence . Mr. Wilson was finally confirmed , 77 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispose of his stock . In his first seventeen weeks at the Pentagon he cut nearly 40,000 civilian employes from the Defense Department staff . He radically changed the overall approach to mobilization of United States defense plants from former Secretary Robert Lovett 's " broad base " ( widespread sources of supply , including many small manufacturers ) to Mr. Wilson 's pet concept of a " narrow base " ( restricted sources of supply , mainly ' to big , highly skilled corporations ) . Finally he slashed more than $5,000,000,000 from the armed forces ' appropriations for fiscal 1954 . Outcry for Resignation There was an outcry ( the first of many ) for Mr. Wilson 's resignation . But the new Secretary stuck to his " New Look " program and weathered the storm Basically the ? " New Look " was a recognition that atomic weapons must be integrated throughout the services . This called for a revolution in military concepts . Mr. Wilson presided over the formulation of a new policy placing main reliance on massive retaliation against aggressors , urgent production of nuclear weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures needed for the build-up of air power , Mr. Wilson economized mainly by reducing Army and Navy manpower . The Army lost its traditional lead- ' ing role . The discontent of the Army erupted in the " revolt of the colonels " in the late spring of 1956 , when Army officers in the rentagon leaked to newsmen documents blasting the doctrine of atom-armed air power . To prove that the " revolt " was a low-level affair , he ordered the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the service Secretaries to join him in facing the press . While the Military leaders tat glum and passive , Mr. Wilson dismissed the Pentagon dissension as a " little hurricane . " A few weeks later he enraged Congress by remarking that Senatorial proposals to increase Air Force funds were " phony . " No sooner had this fuss abated when he provoked a new uproar by issuing an order that military officers on Washington duty must change to civilian clothes forthwith . This time the President strongly dissented . The prompt consequence was the virtual COncellation of a regulation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grades , to spend 4300 to $500 on civilian clothing . Mr. Wilson again was the center of controversy at the height of the 1954 Congressional campaign . He was talking to newsmen in Detroit kbout unemployment in Toledo and was asked whether he intended to divert some defense contracts to factories there . " rye got a lot of sympathy for people where a sudden change catches them , " he said . " But I 've always liked bird dogs better than kennel-fed dogs myself ? you know , one who 'll get oat and hunt for food rather than sit on his fanny and yell . " This remark was snatched up by the United Auto Workers union and spread throughout the country . The next night in Chicago , where he spoke at a Republican dinner , Mr. Wilson had to pass a double line of pickets derisively emiting barks and yelps . The pickets were accompanied by a German shepherd and two Great Danes . " There are times when my remarks get me in trouble , " Mr. Wilson once remarked . Bat despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of Defense . Succeeded by Mr. Wilson left his post as Secretary . of ? Defense in Octoe ber , 1957 , four and a half years leiter having gone to Washington . His successor was Neil H. , formerly president of Proctor &; Gamble . The next year Mr. Wilson was assailed by Lieut . Gen. James M. Gavin as a man of closed mind who had treated his chief military advisers like " recalcitrant union bosses . " First in a magazine article and then in a book , General Gavin , who retired as the Army 's Chief of Research and Development because of disagreement with the Eisenhower Administration 's defense policy , charged that Pentagon ineptitude and Indecision had left the country in " great peril " from the Soviet missile threat . In reply Mr. Wilson said the book , " War and Peace in the Space Age , " was " full of misstatements , dogmatic opinions and assumptions . " Last year Mr. Wilson and his son Edward made $1,335,000 " by accident " in a land deal with the Chrysler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased Edward 's farm in Troy Township of Oakland County , Mich. , for $992,000 and Mr. Wilson 's adjacent 314 acres for $833,000 . In .1952 the son had paid $250 , - 000 for his land and Mr. Wilson $240,000 for his " to be next door ? to his son . Charles Erwin Wilson often was confused with Charles Edward Wilson , who headed the General Electric Company and became Director of Defense Mobilization for a period under President Harry S. Truman . For clarification , the General Motors Wilson became known as " Engine Charlie , " the General Electric Wilson as " Electric Charlie . " Charles Erwin Wilson was born in Minerva , Ohio , on July 18 , 1890 . His father , Thomas E. Wilson , principal of the local four-room schoolhouse , was a descendant of old American stock ( one great-grandfather served under George Washington , another under Daniel Boone ) . His mother , the former Miss Rosalind Unkefer , was a Quaker and of Pennsylvania Dutch descent . When Mr. Wilson was 4 , his father moved to Mineral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cashier at a local bank . Mineral City was a lively little town of 1,200 , with coal mines and brickyards . The Wilson house was flanked by the homes of the Diebolt brothers , Charles and Bill , both railroad engineers . Charlie ran the Baltimore and , Ohio passenger locomotive to Cleveland and Bill ran the freight . They let the boy ride with them in the cab , explaining the new automatic couplings and telling how the new air brakes could hold a train on the long grade coming down from Sandyville . Graduate of . Carnegie Tech Mr. Wilson 's ambition was fixed from that point . The boy was fascinated by anything mechanical . So in 1906 when the family lived in Pittsburgh , he was ready to enroll at Carnegie Institute of Technology . He completed the tough electrical engineering course in three years and was graduated in 1909 , a month and two days before his nineteenth birthday . Mr. Wilson went to work for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation at 18 cents an hour . By the time he was 22 he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $80 a month ) and had designed Westinghouse 's first motor for auto starters . One day at Westinghouse , he was summoned in greasy overalls to the desk of B. G. Lamme . Mr. Lamme , chief engineer at Westinghouse , was ranked by many with Steinmetz as , an electrical genius . " Young man , how would you like to sit across the desk there and help me ? " Mr. Lamme asked . Two years as Mr. Lamme 's junior asktent were invaluable for Mr. Wilson . When World War I broke out , the company insisted that his special skills were too important to the war effort to be spared . Mr. Wilson turned down the offer of a captaincy ie the Army and went to Washington on a series of special jobs for the Army , Navy and the fledgling air service . He designed and developed radio generators and dynamotors for the Army and Navy , a primitive crystal set for the infantry , and electrical equipmerit for the Army 's " B " truck . His work impressed 0 . F. Conklin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new corporation called General Motors . After the war , Mr. Conklin came to Pittsburgh and offered a salary of more than triple Mr. Wilson 's wages of ; 250 a month if Mr. Wilson became chief engineer and sales manager of Remy 's auto division . The Wilsons moved to Detroit its 1919 . Itemy ryas the stepchild of The New York Times Charles E. Wilson the G. M. family , a potentially profitable business gone sour during the post-war business I depression . Mr. Wilson decided he would have to move to Anderson , Ind. , where the factory was located . He had to overcome a brief rebellion by Mrs. Wilson , who loved Detroit . ? At Anderson Mr. Wilson found that P.emy 's products were not well designed for mass production . Too many kinds of machine tools were required . There was no smooth flow of materials : inventories piled up ( wastefully and lopsidedly . Mr. Wilson initiated a redesigning program that helped to put Remy on a sound financial basis . In 1926 , when Delco , another electrical company in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson became president and general manager of the Delco-Remy Corporation , which then had about 12,000 employes . He devised a plan by which , through consolidation of all ignition work in Anderson , G. M. would save $5,000,000 a year . But Mr. Wilson refused to move work out of Dayton until he could move in new industries to take up the unemployment slack . He created two new industries for Dayton : mass production of fractional horsepower motors for household appliances ( refrigerators , washing machines , oil burners , etc ) and mass production of Lovejoy hydraulic shock absorbers , which soon became standard equipment . After these successes Mr. Wilson was named vice president of G. M. and moved back to Detroit to head the entire group of accessory . companies . Negotiated With Labor Mr. Wilson 's first experience in labor negotiations came in 1937 . Detroit was plagued by sit-down strikes and labor wars . Mr. Wilson was called in by the late William S. Knudsen , then president of G. M. " You take care of this labor business , " Mr. Knudsen told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have and you talk more . " In negotiations Mr. Wilson showed patience and stamina ; he was willing to sit up all night talking . Some executives complained he was not tough ' enough . They called him " Compromise Everything Wilson . " Lying in bed in 1941 recovering from a fractured hip suffered in a fall while ice skating , Mr. Wilson thought up the , famous " escalator clause , " which tied workers ' wages to the cost of living . This formula was designed to permit long-term agreements and avoid strikes every year or so . The escalator clause would protect workers against inflation and also give them an automatic 3 cents an hour increase annually as their share in the increased productivity of the corporation . Mr. Wilson had to work hard to get this accepted by management and labor . It was not until 1948 that , working with Walter Reuther of the U. A. W. , he was able to put his formula into operation . In 1940 , when President Franklin D. Roosevelt summoned Mr. Knudsen to Washington to direct defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. In January , 1941 , Mr. Knudsen resigned as president of G. and Mr. Wilson succeeded him . Mobilizing G. M. for war , Mr. Wilson supervised the production of about one-fourth of all the tanks , armored cars and airplane engines built in the United States ; almost half the machine guns and carbines , two-thirds of the heavy trucks and thousands of carrier aircraft as well as three-fourths of the Diesel horsepower used by the Navy . Mr. Wilson continued to serve as a member of the board of directors of General Motors and attended the board 's last meeting in New York on Sept. 11 . One of his last public services was as chairman of the Michigan advisory committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights . In this role , he and other members of the committee studied civil rights in such fields as housing , education , employment and agriculture .
