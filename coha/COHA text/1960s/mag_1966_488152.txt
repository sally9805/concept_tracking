Mr. Roberts has been Newsweek 's Washington correspondent for twelie yea 's . His LBJ 's Inner Circle was published by Delacorte . Washington In the historic East Room of the White House , its grandeur only slightly marred by the blinking red eyes and snaking cables of TV cameras , President Johnson laid down two big news stories for the Washington press corps on October 6 . At one of his rare live-TV news conferences , he announced plans for his 25,000-mile , six-nation Asian-Pacific tour and named career diplomat Llewellyn Thompson as Ambassador to the Soviet Union . In the question period that followed his announcements Mr. Johnson 's answers were , for the most part , substantive and responsive to the questions asked ( He said firmly . for instance , that he had ' ' no plans " to support segiegationist Democratic gubernatorial candidates in the South ) Even more remarkable . his replies were delivered in good humor . He had no complaints about recent stories misrepresenting his position , nor did he cut otf correspondents in mid-question or browbeat any who presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's seventy-eighth press conference in less than thirty-five months ? and one of his best performances . To " regular " White House reporters who have covered most of his conferences , at home and away . there was a simple explanation for the President 's good behavior. he was on TV . When it comes to meeting the reporters . the regulars learned long ago , there are two President Johnsons . In his office , where most conferences are held , without benefit of TV cameras , the President is a fearsome antagonist . The transcripts of these encounters . printed in only two or three newspapers , rarely show how severely the President deals with questions  --  or questioners  --  he does n't like . The other Lyndon Johnson emerges when TV cameras are projecting him into the living rooms ot Keokuk and Alhambra . ( He has had just twenty live-TV confer ences , ) Then he is the very model of a modern President  --  courteous , smiling , sincere , uncomplaining , exuding information and brimming with bonhomie . Washington newsmen can and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's news conferences are only a small , though highly visible , part of his dealings with the press . His press relations , which go on for 365 days a year , are a more complicated  --  and a sadder  --  story . It is a story that needs telling not because there are some disgruntled reporters in Washington but because the press ( including radio and 1V ) is still the primary means of communication between the President and the American people . It le , in f'Act , his primnry means of communication with the world . A President may be a formidable man in face-to-face encounters , as Lyndon Johnson is when he administers the treatment " to a visiting head of state . Hemay fire off 100 letters a day and he may be tremendously effective on the telephone . Lyndon Johnson has made the phone an instrument of national policy . But what he has to say publicly  --  whether to officials of his own Administration , to President de Gaulle . to Premier Ky in Saigon . to an unruly left-wing faction on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he must communicate through the press if he is really to be heard At the same time . in its reporting of what he says and does , the press has a unique opportunity and responsibility to hold the President accountable for the conduct of his office . It the press is , as its owners insist , a public trust . then it must examine his every act critically . And , in the Presidential press conference , it has the opportunity to raise questions on behalf of the public , to make him answerable to his vast constituency . The Presidential press conference is still our nearest equivalent to  --  and in some ways an improvement on  --  the time-honored question period in the British House of Commons . This is an important relationship then , not just for newsmen or the President , but for the welfare of the country . It is , in tact , as Walter Lippmann has said , " a great matter of state . " The first thing to he said about Presidential press relations , in fairness to Mr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsmen and news media did not originate with Mr , Johnson , it is as old as the Presidency itself George Washington , who was generally scornful of " publick " printers , nevertheless resorted to the primitive device ot playing favorites to get a good press He handed the only copy of one of his most important speeches to a single Philadelphia newspaper Other papers called him " treacherous , " " mischievous , " " inefficient " and " pusillanimous " When he submitted the first draft of his Fatewell Address to the first Presidential ghost writer , Alexander Hamilton , it contained a passage striking hack at the press for its abuse ot him It was Hamilton , apparently , who struck out the passage , thus establishing a rule that some wise politicians still follow Do n't fight the press , or , in more earthy terms , do n't get in a spraying contest with a skunk . Washington 's successor . John Adams , had a simpler idea for getting things printed just the way he wanted them to appear . He proposed the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Jefferson , the man who said he would prefer a nation without a government to a nation without newspapers , seemed to prefer a nation with ; list one newspaper while he was President . He designated a single journal , the National lntelligencer , as his mouthpiece . Not surprisingly , he was accused in other papers of being an atheist . keeping a mistress , trying to seduce a friend 's wife and padding his expense accounts . This led Jeffprsnn to make a cynical proposal which I can almost hear Lyndon Johnson making today Jefferson suggested , hall seriously , that editors should divide their papers into sections labeled " Truths , " " Probabilities , " " Possibilities " and " Lies , " The first section , he observed wryly , would be the smallest and the last the biggest . Almost every President since has shared this acid , feeling toward the press when things were n't going his way ? when he was having trouble prosecuting a frustrating war ( the Civil War , the Korean War or the Vietnamese War ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the tribulations of Grant , Harding , Truman , Eisenhower and Lyndon Johnson come to mind ) ; or when the press pried into his family affairs ( here you can name any of the thirty-five men who have held the office ) . The Presidents have struck back at their tormentors in Various ways . Theodore Roosevelt , though he was the first President to provide working space for the press in the White House , shunned correspondents he disliked , while ' lavishing exclusive stories on " reliable " reporters , Woodrow W118on , who in 1913 cohceiVed the Presidential press conference as We now know it ? " to take the people of the country into his confidence " ? lost confidence in his own . invention and sintply stopped seeing the reporters . Franklin D. RooseVelt , though generally , regarded as the most adept President at handling neWSinem once tried to stand a reporter in. a corner with a dunce cap on his head and , on another occasion , awarded , the German Iron Cross to a correspondent he thought had given comfort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , threatened to kick ' a Washington Post music critic where it would hurt the most for writing an unsympathetic review of his daughter 's vocal efforts , Even President Eisenhower , whose bland manner evoked gentle handling by the press , once stalked angrily out of a news conference when pressed on the subject of McCarthyism in his administration . John F. Kennedy , almost as thin-skinned , as President Johnson , made light of his bad notices with the deft paraphrase that he was " reading more now but enjoying it less . " But this did not alter the fact that he phoned reporters to complain about their stories , that he peevishly canceled his subscription to the New York Herald Tribune , and that on at least one occasion he phoned a publisher in an effort to have a reporter taken off an assignment . The New York Times left David Halberstam where he was  --  in Vietnam  --  and Halbeistam Won a Pulitzer Prize , It is clear from history , then , that the relations between press and President never have run smooth  --  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade of off-again-onagain Presidential press relations have those relations been off for as long as they have been under Mr. Johnson . There is no way to measure press relations , but all evidence suggests that Mr. Johnson 's are the worst since an aloof , embittered and inept Herbert Hoover pulled into a depression foxhole in 1931 and asked the press , in effect , to leave him alone . That was , by coincidence , the year that Lyndon Johnson first came to Washington , as an aide to a Texas Congressman . It is one of the ironies of the present situation that when he succeeded to the office Mr. Johnson had had more experience in dealing with the press ? ( a period of thirty-two years ) than had any President before him . After he became President at Dallas , LBJ enjoyed . a traditional press honeymoon of three or four , months , During that abbreviated era of good feelings , newsmen swam naked with the President in the White House pool , attended THE NATION / October 24 , .1966 " You think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles Times Kaffeeklatsches in his office , and enjoyed beer barbecues at the LBJ Ranch . Though it was Sometimes difficult to make notes on the President 's " background " thoughts while clutching a barbecued rib in one hand and a paper cup of beer in the other , there was almost a spirit of camaraderie . During those first four months , White House regulars ? the handful of reporters who cover the President daily , at home or on the , road  --  amused themselves by trying to guess when and where Mr. Johnson would hold his next press conference . He tried a dozen different formats , in-chiding one on a bale Of hay at the ranch . A curtain of ice first descended between press , and President in March , 1964 , after reporters wrote that Johnson had sped at 80 or 90 Miles an hour down a Texas highway in his white Lincoln Continental with a Dixie Cup of Pearl beet . close at hand , The President had entertained us at his ranch that day . There was precious little drinking  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared , he felt , With some justification , that his hospitality had been violated . But in the aftermath there seemed to be no soul-searching on the part of the President Who , after all , had endangered the life of the leader of the Pine World . There Was just anger at the press for printing the story . Re has never been ' quite as relaxed with reporters since . The speeding story was followed by a difficult period in Which Mr. Johnson Was surprisingly uncommunicative ? for a man so garrulous , George Reedy , his then press secretary ( he has had three in less than three years ) , tried to , fill , the Word gap with a toirent of circttmlocution , but was largely uninformative , Some of Mr , Reedy 's longwinded answers used to remind me of the boy Who Was asked to spell " banana . " " I know how to spell it , " he said , " but I do n't know when to stop , " As expected , the President thawed out during the 1964 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press . But the situation was exacerbated , rather than helped , by his landslide victory that November At his first post-election press conference , in a memorable thirty-minute session at the LBJ Ranch , he took four gratuitous slaps at the weary instant historians who had followed him through the campaign . A couple of examples : He ridiculed us for " premature " speculation about his intentions in Vietnam . The " speculation " all came true , in spades , a few months later . He told us we had " misled " our readers about the possibility that a Texas politician , Marvin Watson , would join his staff . A few weeks later , Watson joined his staff . Since then , despite the fact that no President has worked harder to cultivate a good press  --  he is attracted to the press as is a moth to the flame ? Mr. Johnson 's press relations have suffered a steady erosion Now , despite some heroic salvage efforts by his third press secretary , Bill D Moyers , there is deep distrust on both sides And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credibility gap " has widened by a country mile On his side , Mr. Johnson has many complaints  --  some of them well founded  --  against the press . He is wary of " self-styled intellectuals " in the Washington press corps ( a phrase he used in a San Antonio speech ) He is weary of those recurring stories comparing his " style " with that of President Kennedy  --  a weariness that I share No two Presidents have the same style , and style is not substance , as some Kennedy-worshiping LBJ critics contend He can not bear stories probing or guessing at his motives or intentions  --  which is a highly hazardous pastime in the case of so complicated and unpredictable a man . Never reconciled to the fact that conflict makes bigger news than orderly events , he sees his minor embarrassments and reverses , ( such as an unfavorable vote in a Congressional committee ) magnified , while his hard-won and significant victories ( such as the establishment of a democratic government in the Dominican Republic ) are relegated to the back pages In short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those newsmen who follow him around like friends , but obviously are n't . How do the newsmen feel about him " First , it should be made clear that few , if any , of Johnson 's Boswells are against him on partisan grounds Many , perhaps most , are advocates of both the Great Society and the Vietnamese War . Nearly all stand in awe of the President 's back-breaking work schedule and his tremendous legislative record . Most agree that he has been the most accessible of Presidents Mr. Johnson has seen more reporters individually and held far more news conferences in his first three years in office than did either President Eisenhower or President Kenne4 . But there is much more to press relations than accessibility and holding news conferences . The working White House reporters ' grievances against the President divide roughly into five categories . ! I Impediments to good reporting , minor annoyances , crop up with such regulanty that they seem to be planned  --  perhaps by a vindictive President The President is hypersensitive to criticism , or even to stories which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for secrecy . His press conferences are proving unsatisfactory is means of extracting information from him . 41 And most important , it has become the fact that the White House , yea , even the President , can not always be believed These grievances add up to a serious indictment and they therefore require substantiation . First , the minor irritants Every business has them , but at the White House , under LBJ , they seem to be systematically manufactured , as if someone in there were saying . " Lets make it hard for those so-and-sos to do their jobs . " Early in this Administration , for example , " pool " reporters  --  representing the entire White House press  --  were removed from the President 's airplane. thereby cutting the contact we had maintained with him ( and his predecessors ) between jet stops , After that , press planes ( booked by the White House but paid for by the correspondents ) began flying so far behind the President that on some trips reporters covering the President never saw him On a trip to Princeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outlying airport , and reporters had to make their way to the scene of a Presidential speech by commandeering a garbage truck There are enough such examples to make it certain that such confusion does n't just happen . ( In Eisenhower 's day , under James Hagerty , the planes , trains and mimeograph machines ran on time , ) Next , the President 's thin skin  --  the thinnest in American politics today His hypersensitivity to criticism , despite thirty-five years in public life , could be forgiven if Mr. Johnson took his lumps in retrospect like , say , Harry Truman , author of the famous political dictum : " If you ca n't stand the heat , get out of the kitchen " ; or Winston Churchill , who said he did n't resent criticism " even when , for the sake of emphasis , it parts for the time with reality " President Johnson takes no such philosophical attitude On the contrary , he is outraged by almost any story that portrays him in a less than flattering light And when thus incensed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he sent Secretary of State Rusk instead of Vice President Humphrey to Winston Churchill 's funeral  --  and was criticized  --  he failed to acknowledge , except in a bitterly sarcastic jibe at the press . that he might have erred . It was the press that made an incident of it , he insisted . When he angered a whole subcontinent by his abrupt and undiplomatic cancellation of invitations to Pakistan 's President Ayub and India 's Pi ime Minister Shastri , again it was those troublemaking reporters  --  not the President  --  who had stirred up a fuss Last spring , when the President intimated to a group of White House fellows that he might ask Congress for a tax increase soon if prices continued to rise , and the Associated Press duly reported his remarks . the President took an even more startling tack . He angrily blamed the conscientious A.P . White House correspondent for that day 's $10 billion drop in prices on the New York Stock Exchange A phrase the President used in deploring the AyubShastri stories gives some insight into his ideas about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a news conference about the postponement of the visits , he glared and lamented that we had " speculated " about his reasons for telling the two Asian leaders , in effect , to unpack their bags . To Mr. Johnson " speculate , " clearly , is a dirty word . And all stories ruminating on what he might do or why are branded " speculative , " which is to say , evil . Though for many years such stories , variously known as think pieces or thumbsuckers , have passed for public discussion of problems confronting the President , Mr. Johnson feels that they narrow his " options . " Apparently the President thinks that the press should print the news , in tape-recorder fashion , just as he dictates it , without any unauthorized explanation , interpretation , background or speculation . If that day comes , it should be noted , there will be no need for White House correspondents  --  the , Federal Register dutifully reports the President verbatim . The President hates to be anticipated , and this relates to the third grievance ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcements is essential to both politics and statecraft . For years , we have heard a succession of White House press secretaries say : " When we have anything to announce we 'll announce it . " And most of us agree that a President should not " permit the priorities of the press to hustle the procedures of government . " But with Lyndon Johnson , secrecy is carried to ' such extremes that it sometimes seems to interfere with the orderly process of government , as well as with reasonable enterprise on the part of correspondents . The President , in fact , seems to have an Alice in Wonderland concept of the news . Like the Queen of Hearts , nothing is so until he says it 's so . And if anyone in government says something is so before Mr. Johnson says it , he risks the fate of the Queen 's ' courtiers . Nothing angers him more than to have the name of a prospective Presidential appointee appear in the press before he makes the appointment . Last March he was furious when The Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of State U. Alexis Johnson as his ambassador to Japan . After reading the report he barged into a news conference being conducted by Agriculture Secretary Orville Freeman to denounce it . He branded it " some kid 's statement over at the State Department " ? a phrase that was changed to " someone 's statement " in the sanitized transcript of his remarks put out by the White House . His obvious anger at being scooped by the Post made the future of Alex Johnson a forbidden subject at the State Department  --  until last month when Mr. Johnson , apparently having cooled down , made it official and named him our ambassador to Japan . After many such instances , White House aides have adopted a policy of refusing to discuss even what kind of man the President might seek to fill any government job . I laughed , a year ago , when a member of the President 's staff told me that if I printed the name of a likely candidate for a sub-Cabinet job , I would scuttle for all time that candidate 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , in a lecture to newsmen on the evils of speculation , the President virtually confirmed that that is his policy : When you see on the ticker that Oshkosh says that Bob Pierpoint may be named Chairman of the Joint , Chiefs of Staff he said , looking at C B.S. News Correspondent Robert Pierpoint you do n't necessarily give much credence to it , because the very fact that it is on there is the best indication that it is not likely to happen . This is now known as " The Oshkosh Rule . " The fourth grievance is aimed at the quality of the President 's press conferences . Mr. Johnson , as I have noted , holds enough of them . ( " Enough of them " reminds me of Bill Moyers ' reply when asked how long . was the incision the surgeons made to remove the President 's gall stones . His reply was " long enough . " ) As of the week of October 3i the President had faced the press seventy-eight times in less than thirty-five months  --  an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on qualitative , rather than quantitative analysis , LBJ 's conferences fall below the standards set by his two immediate predecessors . Unlike Eisenhower 's and Kennedy 's , which were scheduled and announced to correspondents in advance , Mr. - Johnson 's are known in advance only to LBJ . In most cases , White House correspondents are called into them with little or . no advance warning. , These " quickies " exclude journalists from other beats  --  the State Department , Justice , Treasury and the Pentagon  --  who might come to ask prepared , incisive , detailed questions in their , areas . The regular White House correspondents , who must be specialists mainly on LBJ , rarely have time to prepare for a dialogue in which they , willy-nilly , speak for the voters . The President is obviously aware of the advantage he carries into such a conference , In these impromptu meetings , a Presidential aide once boasted to me , the reporters " never lay a glove " on the champ . To , make sure they do n't , the President keeps reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortcomings of their profession , and bristling at those who probe into sensitive areas . President Eisenhower , despite his tangled , five-star syntax , usually told us what he thought . Mr. Kennedy gave witty answers , but was basically an artful dodger . President Johnson , though he has a firmer grasp of issues than Eisenhower , and just as firm a purpose as JFK , is neither candid nor witty . Indeed , the President 's purpose in his impromptu conferences seems to be to dominate and even intimidate the press rather than tell reporters what is on his mind Nothing the President does has engendeied mole hostility among newsmen than his constant deriding , belittling and berating of the press . If reporters could talk back to the President in his news conferences  --  which , by custom and in the interest of public safety , they ca n't  --  one of the first messages they would get to him would be " Look , Mr. President , you run your business and let us run ours " But the gravest of Johnson 's errors in dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his repeated efforts to try to fool the reporters , and hence the public The fact that the President of the United States can not always be believed is far more ominous for his and the country 's future than his rudeness and lack of consideration toward Journalists , his hypersensitivity or his passion for sect ecy . White House iepoiters who had not covered LBJ as a Senator got their first inkling of his deviousness , of his willingness to play a little fast and loose with the facts , less than a month after he took office . In his first press conference , asked about the federal budget he would send to Congress in Ianu-ry , 1964 , the President pointed out that John F. Kennedy 's last budget amounted to $98 8 billion , and he would have to add about $3 5 billion to that to cover " built-in " increases in the cost of government . A few days later , at a backgrounder in Austin , Tex , reporters were led to believe , on highest authority , that the President could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget stories accordingly . When he submitted his first budget in January , 1964 , about a 111011i h later , it totaled $97.7 billion  --  a breathtaking s3 billion to $4 billion under what the Picsidcnt and his aides had held out as an uieducible minimum . Voilal Mr Johnson looked like a fiscal . Houdira  --  and thepress , which had been used , looked i idiculous Later in 1964 , the North Vietnamese government extended a peace feeler to the United States through UN Secretary-General U Thant . The Secretary-General was sufficiently impressed to get the Hanoi government to agree to meet an American representative in Rangoon We might never have heard of this offer if U Thant had not made a speech in February , 1965 , charging that the American people were not getting all the facts about the war When the White House was asked to comment , it denied U 7 haul 's charge , saying thet c were then no " meaningful proposals " ham e the U S Government . Not until last fall , after Adlai Stevenson 's death , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight Eric Sevaieid , a distinguished alumnus of this school , then iepoited that Ambassador Stevenson had told him , before his death , of the Hanoi feeler How now ' ' the State Department was asked " Yes , " State then recalled , theie had been a proposal hom Hanoi through U " Thant , but it was " too nebulous " to be taken seriously . the White House had an out , of suits It had said that . it had no " meaningful " proposals before it But in view of the President 's oft-repeated call for " unconditional " talks , and his insistence that " our antennae aie always out " forfeelers , the Administration had not enhanced its reputation for veracity The next widening of the credibility gap , or the chasm of candor , came in February , 1965 , when the President first ordered sustained aerial bombing north of the 17th Parallel in Vietnam Correspondents were touted out of bed that morning of February 7 to hear that American planes had attacked an ammunition dump at Dong Hot , just over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was escalating the war ' ' No , we were told , it was a " reprisal " raid , answering a Vietcong mortar attack on the American barracks at Pleiku the day before It was not a change of strategy , the White House maintained , but only in " tactics " The Administration stuck to that position during the weeks and months of air attacks that followed These facts are susceptible of only two inteiprctations Either this is the longest rephsal raid in history and the war was never escalated , or the White House uttered an untruth Two months later , in Apill. 1965 . President Johnson ( ) facial 2,500 American paratroopers into the Dominican Republic The sole purpose of his intervention in the Dominican revolution , he solemnly told us , was to protect the lives of some 2,000 Americans living in that country . When , after 1 100 Americans had been evacuated and the President had escalated the U.S troop commitment to 21,500 ( about twenty times the number of Americans remaining to be protected ) newsmen asked whether this was still just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until May 2 did the President acknowledge that he had intervened to prevent a Communist take-over in Santo Domingo Then , the following month , in a burst of Texas hyperbole , he told a news confeierm that " sonic 1,500 innocent people were nuirdeled and shot and their heads cut otf " ? a statement that has neser been substantiated by any investigating agency . The nntmalean " ? P 1% the more filch esstn2 because there was no apparent need for distortion . There is , in fact , good reason to believe that some readers and listeners who gagged on the story of the life-saving mission would have swallowed with alacrity a simple explanation that we were intervening to prevent another Castro in the Caribbean . In the fall of 1965 , when aluminum producers announced a price increase which the President regarded as inflationars , our credulity was again strained past the breaking point . The Administration promptly announced it would dump aluminum from government stockpiles on the market . ' I his was an obvious ( and incidentally , successful ) move to force a puce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House told them time was " no connection whatsoever " between the two moves LBJ , were supposed to believe , had Just decided to get rid of some old aluminum . There are other examples of outright prevarications , half-ti uths , and misleading denials by this Administration . Few of them involved the national security , where most news-men are willing to abide by Bill Moyers ' prudent finding that " there is a season for even ything , including silence " he iccord is now so murky that Mi . Johnson is suffer-ing what his own ambassador to the UN , Arthur Goldberg , called a ' ' crisis of confidence " and what the Republicans are gleefully adsertising as the " credibility gap " Now , when the President says there is no need for a tax increase , ? we wonder . Now , when he says we are willing to talk to anyone , anywhere , any time , about peace in Vietnam , the heads of other governments must ask : " Does he really mean it ? " This despite the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our economy or more wants an honorable peace in Vietnani than Lyndon Johnson . Defenders of the President may say , with him , that the news media are sometimes wrong , too . They are sometimes wrong out of malice , sometimes from haste , and often for want of better information from the government . But the central fact in any discussion of comparative credibility is that the United States Government can not afford to be misleading or untruthful . As we learned in the U-2 incident and at the Bay of Pigs , not only the President but the whole country suffers when our head of government is caught dissembling or lying . As James Reston has noted : " Even the most powerful government can not be effective if it is not to be trusted , if thoughtful and disinterested men , including our friends and allies , are always scanning our official statements and actions for some unstated motive other than the one given . " The President 's press relations , then , are important , not just for the newsmen or the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important an office to be covered by a habitually disgruntled press . Skeptical reporters , yes , but not angry reporters . And the role of the press in covering the President is too important for the President continually to deride and derogate it . What can be done ? The situation , as I see it ( and as the French would describe it ) , is hopeless but not desperate . An easing of tensions could start ; with token concessions on both sides . If , say , the President would start announcing his weekend travel plans by Wednesday noon , the press would stop dropping cigarette ashes on his sculptured blue carpet . If the President would hold one pre-announced , live-TV news conference every fortnight instead of three unannounced quickies a week ( and not consume most of them reading prepared announcements ) , then the reporters would ask more intelligent questions . From these minor accommodations we could proceed to more substantive matters . If the President would recognize that the press is not working either for him or against him , but merely doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficult task of covering clearly and objectively a very complex man in an incredibly demanding job . ( This would hot rule out " speculation , " but we could do with fewer stories on LBJ 's " style " or lack of it . ) We then would still be a long way from a full d  --  tente . But for our part , we do not want fraternization  --  only full disclosure within the bounds of the national security . We do not want to be captivated by the President 's charm any more than we want to be intimidated by his anger . Solution of the most serious problem  --  the unbelievable White House  --  is admittedly most difficult , for here the initiative must come from the President . And this , I fear , may be like asking the leopard to change his spots . However , I do n't think we 're going to , have a healthy relationship between press and President  --  with mutual respect and lessened hostility  --  until Mr. Johnson is convinced that Presidents of the United States must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unvarnished truth . Helping him make that decision is surely a job for the one ordained Baptist minister on his staff , his press secretary , the Rev. Bill , D. Moyers . In this undertaking , Mr. Moyers will have the full support of ' the White House press .
