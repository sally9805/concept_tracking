A KIND OF ANGER by Eric Ambler. 311 pages . Atheneum. $4.95 . <P> A wealthy Iraqian refugee is shot to death in the bedroom of his secluded Swiss villa . A black Mercedes 3005 piloted by a beautiful girl roars away into the snowy night . The refugee turns out to have been the ex-chief of Iraq 's security forces , who was conspiring against his government . The vanished girl turns out to be his French mistress , Lucia Bernardi . There is a missing suitcase full of documents . There are oil interests . And when the police of three countries are stumped , there is even Piet Maas , a brilliant , disillusioned young Dutch journalist who is told by his boss to Find That Girl ! Cut ! Next scene : the sunny Riviera . . . <P> Ten times in the past 27 years , Author Ambler has taken ingredients not unlike these and distilled his own aromatic blend of 160-proof suspense-sometimes with the smoky overtones of his early A Coffin for Dimitrios , sometimes with the dry , fruity tang of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jules Dassin as Topkapi ) . This time , unfortunately , somebody 's been tinkering with the formula . As Piet and Lucia go through their appointed rounds of deception and huff-and-puff chase , the reader begins to realize that too many of the motivations are phony , too much of the real action takes place offscreen , while too much of the onscreen talk comes out with a kind of freshly translated stiffness , as though the characters were speaking directly in English subtitles .
