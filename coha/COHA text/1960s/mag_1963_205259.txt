Until last week Chancellor Konrad Adenauer 's Christian Democrats had won a majority among the rural , conservative voters of Rhineland-Palatinate in every election since the West German Republic was founded in 1949 . But the latest vote for the state legislature gave the C.D.U . only 46 of 100 seats , and 44.4% of the popular vote , a loss of 4% since the 1959 election . The Socialists , by contrast , moved up from 37 seats to 43 in the conservative stronghold , taking 40.7% of the vote , a gain of nearly 6% . Cried Socialist Spokesman Fritz Barsig : " The ice is finally broken . " <P> The C.D.U . would continue to govern Rhineland-Palatinate in coalition with the Free Democrats , but it was clear that its loss there was the most damaging that the party had suffered in five state elections in the past 16 months . Taking stock , C.D.U . officials were now certain that the fault lay with der Alte 's obstinate fight to hang onto his post , blocking the succession of Economics Minister Ludwig Erhard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uncle Ludwig " is by far the most popular politician in the country ; a recent public-opinion poll showed that he is regarded by 25% of the voters as the best man to succeed Adenauer , whereas Socialist Leader Willy Brandt is favored by only 12% . But with federal elections only two years away , 32% of those polled now look on the Socialists as the " most sympathetic party , " while only 30% so regard the C.D.U . A three-man C.D.U . committee chosen to name the next Chancellor appears convinced that only Erhard can reverse the tide . But Adenauer holds out against a quick decision . For the Socialists , who hope to whittle C.D.U . margins even more dramatically in four other state elections before mid-1964 , der Alte 's continued silence can be golden .
