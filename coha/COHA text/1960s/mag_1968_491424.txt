7 It was a hot June day , and the air conditioning I was turned up in the restaurant . but I was sweating . Seated at the table with me were two leaders of the New England " family " of the Mafia  --  Larry Baioni and Ralph Lamattina . The meeting was n't going well . It was mostly small talk , and Lamattina and Baioni kept studying me with the detached air of professional killers . Then , suddenly . a man walked over to the table from the bar . My two luncheon companions stiffened . I recognized the newcomer by his hatchet face . He was Raymond Patriarca , the Mafia boss of New England . Patriarca did not sit down . He did not offer to shake hands . He stared at me for what seemed to he a full two minutes with his cold , black eyes . Then , looking at Baioni and Lamattina. he inclined his head toward the bar , and without saying a word . walked away . Baioni and Lamattina scrambled to their feet and followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . After a while two other men joined them . They all kept looking over at me . In about 10 minutes Baioni and Lamattina returned to the table . " OK , " Lamattina said . " now let 's talk business . " From that moment on . I was an associate of the Mafia . The situation in which I found myself is not uncommon today . There are a lot of ordinary businessmen who get mixed up with the mob because of money troubles , and the Mafia , with its superb intelligence system , always seems to know who will go along . The organization keeps its eye on the executive who goes broke betting on horses with a Mafia-controlled bookie , or the businessman who must turn to Mafia loan sharks when he runs out of credit at legitimate banks . Then , when the victim ca n't pay his debts and is thoroughly frightened , he is offered an " out . " He can front for the Mafia in a business enterprise , or he can ask favors for the mob from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these liaisons is to use the victim to penetrate the Government . to buy protection for illegal operations . and to set up legitimate businesses , both for investment and for hiding illegitimate money from gambling , narcotics and hijacking . My own background intrigued the M aim ? which . I later discovered , knew more about me than Dun &; Bradstreet  --  and I became a natural prospect for the organization . I was born on Beacon Hill into a family that dates back to the early settlers of Massachusetts . Nly ancestors , in fact , came over on the Mavlower . My father , Frank W , Grinnell , was an internationally famous expert on constitutional law and editor of the Massachusetts Law Quarterly for nearly 50 years before his death . I went to private schools  --  Dexter . and Browne and Nichols . At the age of nine I had my own horse at the family 's country home in Ipswich . At 16 I was already wearing white-tie-and-tails to Social Register affairs  --  and also hanging around the bars and burlesque houses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , but I never went to college . I flunked the entrance exam for West Point , and , while working as a brokerage messenger , I went back to horseback riding , society parties and nights on the town with my friends . In 1936 I joined the 26th National Guard Division ? the Yankee Division -- just so I could play polo on Army horses . One of the other two men on my indoor polo team was Maj. Gen. Daniel Needham , commander of the division and a good friend of my father . The coming of World War 11 ended the polo . After taking a special course at M , I.T ? I became a meteorologist in the artillery and then the Air Corps . Later I began drinking too much . When the drinking led to a serious case of pneumonia , the Army gave me an honorable medical discharge . I then went to a psychiatrist for six months and licked the problem of alcohol . If this early history was interesting to the Malia , so , in a different way . was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a career in journalism and got a job in Niontpelier . Vt. , as a reporter with The Evening Argus . It was a small daily , and I was able to rise fairly rapidly . After an apprenticeship on the police beat , I became a columnist , and eventually the city editor . I spent 11 constructive and fascinating years in Montpelier . I also worked as general manager of radio station WSKI . I was a trustee of a hospital and a Congregational church , and I did a medical-news radio program for Blue Cross . On the side , I became a deputy sheriff , took a course at the Vermont State Police School and served as a part-time press consultant to the state police commissioner , all activities that were to be particularly intriguing to the Mafia . So were certain aspects of my next job . I was press secretary to the New England Governors Conference , which was part of the New England c , , , ? Lui kn . Economic Development . Working closely with the offices of the governors and police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs , including a communications and blockade network to he used when there were hank roltheries in the region . I left this job in 1963 to become executive vice president of the Smaller Business Association of New England . I spent much of my lime lobbying and testifying in Washington , D.C. , and I got to know a lot of people in the Government . It was interesting and productive work , but it did n't last . My politics were a lot more liberal than those of the president of the association . We disagreed constantly , and in June , 1964 , we parted company . Suddenly , after 20 years of making a satisfactory living , I was out of a job . It could n't have happened at a worse time . I was in a period leading up to a costly divorce , and a serious illness in my family had drained my finances . Soon I was close to bankruptcy , one of the most disgraceful things that can happen to you in Boston society . I had to borrow a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business community began to he wary of me . I did n't realize it at the time , but the Mafia was getting ready to move in on me . It soon did . I had remarried and opened a one-man publicrela lions office in a suburb of Boston . I had just one client  --  a small foundation for which I did fundraising work  --  and I was barely able to make ends meet . To pick up some extra money , I began to spread the word that I 'd be willing to share the office with anyone who 'd split the rent with me . A few days later there was a soft rap on the door and a man walked in . He was a nicely dressed . elderly gentleman , who introduced himself ( we 'll call him Irving Kaye . not his real name ) and said he needed office space . which he had heard I was willing to provide . He said be was in the **25;2936;TOOLONG business . He seemed to know all about my financial problems and offered me $200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms in my suite , told him I 'd think it over and let him know . When he left , I made a few phone calls about him . He was n't too well known in town . About all I could find out was that he owned a couple of small bars I had some misgivings about not being able to find out more , but the $200 looked so good to me that I phoned Kaye the next morning and told him he could move in . Two days later , on May H. 1966 . Kaye arrived with a truckload of furniture . I asked him if he wanted his own phone . and he said , " No , I 'll use your phone . " He peeled off bills from a huge roll of cash to pay for the phone in advance . Then he went to work , and it took me exactly a half hour to realize he was not in the **25;2963;TOOLONG business . I overheard him taking bets on horses , laying off bets from bookies and giving orders to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also overheard calls involving loan-sharking . I went into Kaye 's office and said , " What the hell goes on with you ? " He smiled benignly . " Oh , " he said . " I run a small book and numbers , and I do a little moneylending . I Figure you 've already guessed that , but from what I know about you . you 're the kind of fellow who 'll keep his mouth shut . I know you 're in a hole financially , and my friends and I can help you out . " I said , ' ' How about the cops ? " He said . " This is an ideal place . The cops will never find this spot way out here in the suburbs , " I asked him about the telephone company . He said , " They do n't care . I 'm just another customer , and it 's your phone anyway . " He did n't ask me if he could do this . He hold me . In one day my public-relations office had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my stomach , and I went back to my own office to think over what I had gotten myself into . I ilid n't kiim what to do . 13u1 Kaye hail promised me business , which I badly needed . and I guess I talked myself into believing I hilt I would he satisyule my curiosity as a former et ime reporter and law-enforcement man . I decided to play along with the situation- without even telling my wife- just to see how far it would go . A few days later , Kaye said to me , " I 'm in a jam , and I need your help . I do n't feel well . and I need someone to go with me to make my collec-tions : ' I did n't want to go , but I did n't want to antagonise him . So I said OK . Kaye put a gun in his pocket. , and we got into his big white Cadillac , I drove . For the rest of the afternoon we rode around in the slums of Charlestown , Somerville and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop , and then he would pop into a little grocery or candy store , Waiting in the car . I watched for cops and holdup men , but nobody bothered us . By 6 P , Ni . Kaye had collected $3.000 apparently a normal day 's take . He said . " I 'm glad you 're with me . I 've got a bail heart , and if I drop dead , the first cop who finds me will keep all the money . I ligure that you will have the decency to keep only half and give the rest to my wife . " After this lesson in underworld economics and police morality , I soon got a further insight into the operations of Kaye and the people he referred to as his " friends . " He told me a businessman to whom lie had loaned $15.000 had fallen behind in his " vigorish " payments . IVigorish . I was to learn , is the usurious interest , sometimes as much as 240 percent a year , that the Mafia and its allies demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Personally I do n't like violence , and I do n't want to send my friends ' goons after this guy . So how about you ? You 're a big fellow . Just go up there and scare him a little . " I froze . " What 's my legal position if I do this ? " I asked . " Oh . " he said , " you 're the same as a collector for a loan company . " I told him I 'd let him know in the morning . and I went home and spent a restless night . When I went into the office the next day . I still did n't know how I was going to get myself out of the assignment . But as soon as he saw me . Kaye said gloomily , " About that collection . do n't bother . My friends took care of it in a different way . " Later I picked up a newspaper and saw a picture of Kaye 's client . The story accompanying the photograph reported that the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mysterious explosion . " One day in June , 1966. a month or so after Kaye had moved in with me . I was talking on the telephone with a broadcaster I knew about a radio station that was for sale in Providence . R.I. I thought I could earn a commission by acting as a broker for a group of Boston businessmen who wanted to get into radio . Kaye overheard my conversation , and he came into my office as soon as I had hung up . He was holding a sheaf of papers " This is a complete financial report I had run on you , Grinnell. " he said . " It do n't look so good . You 've got to make some money , and with this record , you ai n't going to get it from a bank . Now this radio station I just heard you talking about . That 's the kind of deal my friends have in mind . They might put up all the money and let You run it . The big boys are in Providence . you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I asked . " Who are the big boys ? " Kaye said . " Raymond Patriarca . " This was the first time he had openly named the New England Mafia boss or anyone else in the Cosa Nostra . I could actually feel a chill go through me. i " I got ta get next to two people to see if there 's any interest , " Kaye said . " The first would be Henry Tameleo . " " Who 's he ? " 1 asked . " He 's the Number One boy  --  the project Ilantiler for Raymond . But I ca n't get hold of Tameleo without making a Boston call . " " Who do you call in Boston ? " I said . " Ralphie Chiong , " he said . " His real name 's Ralph Lamattina , but they call him Ralphie Chiong because he looks like a Chink . " That 's how I Caine to have lunch on that hot June afternoon . The table was reserved in my name , and when I got there Lamattina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lombardo and undoubtedly was of Italian extraction , but his face did seem strangely Oriental . The man with him . Larry Baioni , was a dapper , crewcut type who could have been mistaken for any businessman on a commuter train . He was in his late 40 's . Irving had told me that Baioni was one of the toughest , fastest-rising lieutenants in the entire New England " family " of the Maria . I sweated through the episode when Boss Patriarca approved me after coming over to the table . Then . when Lamattina said , " Let 's talk business , " the conversation was the same as if they were normal executives discussing deals . Lamattina began by informing me that the radio station idea had been turned down . " because our research shows that daytime-only radio stations do n't make money . " Then Lamattina said , " I just got out of St. Elizabeth 's Hospital . " I had noticed that half of his hand was missing . It looked as if it had been shot away or perhaps cut with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . He looked at me and snapped , " You do n't ask questions like that around here . " I muttered I was sorry , and Lamattina continued : " While I was in the hospital I was impressed with the TV rental setup there . I think it 's a good idea to get a few concessions like that . It 's a cash business , and you only need a couple of men to install and service the sets , and you get two dollars a day from each patient . 1 can get all the sets I want for forty dollars apiece . " I went to the administrator of St. Elizabeth 's and offered a big donation to the hrrs 4tal in return for the TV rental concession . He turned me down . But I been studying your record , and I see that you had a lot of experience in Vermont with the medical profession -- you being a trustee of a hospital and doing that radio show for The Blue Cross , and all . It should he easy for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals around here and get the concessions . It could he 900 sets in three hospitals ? $1.800 a day . You 'd run the concessions for us . There 's twenty G 's a year in it for you . " " It sounds interesting . " I said . " Think about it . " Lamattina said . " And do n't forget it 's legit . " Then he said , " You know , I been thinking . There are some of us who would like to go into the cemetery business . It would be completely legit . Grinnell , you ought to use your political and business connections to find 300 acres somewhere within about 40 miles of Boston . You can run this for us for $40,000 a year . We 'll form a nonprofit corporation to buy it . and all the capital would he legit money . " We talked about the cemetery for a long time . I was puzzled at first , but then I remembered having read that the Mafia had gone into the cemetery business elsewhere . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cosa Nostra 's biggest problems is stashing heroin , stolen jewels and money . They have been known to spend a good deal of time traveling to distant cities to rent safe-deposit boxes for this purpose . How much more convenient to use graves in a cemetery only 40 miles from Boston . My luncheon meeting with Lamattina and Baioni lasted about an hour . I did n't know what else to say , so I told them I was impressed with the TV rental and cemetery ideas . and that I 'd explore both . I even told them I already knew of a perfect piece of land for the cemetery in the town of Reading . They seemed pleased . Lamattina sent me back to my office in his Cadillac. driven by a henchman . The man , incidentally , was found shot to death some months later . When I got home that night . I was a basket case . I could n't sleep . and I could n't tell my wife what had happened . I pretended I had to work and sat up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know what to do . I must admit I was seriously tempted by the $60,000 a year that had been offered to me . But , as broke as I was . I also ) knew that if I took the money I 'd be in a worse mess than I had got ten myself into already , and I ' night end up in jail , or dead . And I also could not forget that my father had spent a lifetime lighting corruption . In the middle of the night I decided there was only one thing for me to do  --  tell my story to the police . I made up my mind to go to the FBI . The next day was June 24 , 1966-41 days after Irving Kaye had moved in on me . I waited until Kaye had left my office to make his collections and then I zigzagged furtively to a public phone booth about a block away . I dialed the FBI 's Boston number , 742-5533 , and was told to go to the downtown office . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life history from the time I was born until the luncheon meeting with Lamattina . The clerk then told me to go home ; someone would call me . The call did n't come until the following night  --  after I had spent a desperate day trying to act normally with Kaye at the office . The next afternoon , following instructions , I went to the North Station concourse of the Boston &; Maine Railroad . I paced up and down for a while , and then I had my shoes shined . A handsome , graying man slipped into the seat next to mine and asked , " Mr. Grinnell ? " I said , " Yes . " We both had our shoes shined , and I followed him outside the station . He showed me his identification . He was FBI Special Agent Thomas Sullivan . I repeated the entire story I had dictated to the clerk at FBI headquarters . and Sullivan asked me a lot of questions about my conversation with Lamattina and Baioni . When I had told him everything I knew . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advise me how to get out of my predicament gracefully . Instead he surprised me by asking if I would help the FBI . I said , " How ? " He said , " As an informant . You 're in a good undercover spot . It might be dangerous . but would you be willing to continue with what you 're doing and keep us informed about everything you see or hear ? " I felt the same sinking sensation I had experienced when I met Patriarca . I did n't say a word for a full five minutes . Then I felt a surge of assurance . This was a chance to fight the mob in my small way . " OK . " I said , " I 'll do it . " Although I was still just as broke  --  I was not to be paid for my undercover work and I never got any money from the Mafia  --  I felt better . I went back to the office that same afternoon and began work on the cemetery deal for Lamattina . During the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law on memorial parks . Kaye was highly pleased with all this activity , and since I was now at least a fringe member of the club , he was much less guarded in his discussions with me . He told me about the structure of the Mafia in New England , with Raymond Patriarca running the entire organization ruin the office of his vending-machine company on Atwells Avenue in Providence , and with t ; ennaro Jerry ) Angiulo , the under-boss of the " family , " supervising many operations in the Boston area . Kaye also explained his role and nine as non-Sicilian , non-Mafia allies of the Cosa Nostra . Ile said that the New England " family " was a small one and had to depend on outside labor . The " outfit , " as he called the organization , hired many young hoodlums not necessarily of Sicilian or even Italian descent ) to do the dirty work , such as murder and robbery , and it issued " licenses " to people like himself to operate in certain areas as bookies , numbers men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate consisted of fixed percentages of his gross remitted weekly to the " outfit . " He had been paying tribute to New England racket bosses for nearly 50 years . He said that most of the Mafia allies in his category were of Greek , Jewish . Irish , Syrian or Lebanese extraction . " Yankees , like you , " he said , " they use only for the special jobs  --  fronting legit businesses . " I worked hard at my role and , at the same time . just barely managed to keep my public-relations firm going . I continued the fund-raising for my one client , but now there was no time to look for others . I borrowed more money from a friend . It was a time of constant tension for me . I 'd try to lead my normal life with my wife and the three children . But when we 'd go out to dinner or to a party . I 'd always be looking over my shoulder , afraid that I had been found out . afraid that I would see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the windows . I took out a gun license and kept a .38 caliber revolver with me day and night . I reported regularly to Lamattina . The TV-rental deal fell through because each hospital had its own monopoly . but I gave Lamattina so many valid facts and figures that he was impressed with my research and industry . He told me to concentrate on the cemetery deal . I stalled . but at the same time pleased him with all the maps of possible sites and copies of statutes I was able to accumulate . I also reported regularly to FBI Agent Sullivan . I told him everything that had come to my attention from Kaye and others  --  rumors of an attempted lix of a professional athletic event , the addresses and telephone numbers of bookie and numbers joints , underworld talk about mob murders in Boston . Concerning the cemetery deal . Sullivan told me to string it out with Lamattina as long as I could without committing myself . I kept getting in deeper and deeper . One night , for example , Kaye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ham or garage in the rural area where I lived , His " friends " wanted Instore3M expensive color TV gels that had been hijacked . I found a place . Then I phoned Tom Sullivan at the special emergency number he had given me . I le said he would n't jeopardize me by seizing the sets but would just go in and copy the serial numbers so the theft could he traced . That was the night my wife found out about my double life . Kaye 's call had awakened her . and she overheard me talking to Sullivan . She was so upset that I had to tell her the whole story . When she finally realized what I had been going through , she became stoical about the situation and has been ever since . But neither of us slept that night . In July I got another business offer from the mob . It began with a phone call to Kaye from a man named Eddie in Rhode Island . Kaye obviously had bragged about using me as a front , and Eddie knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse shows for years . Eddie said , " Would you and your horseman be interested in a deal ? We want to open a dude ranch . How about having the horseman look for several hundred acres for the joint ? " Eddie was very specific about what he wanted . First , the dude ranch had to be on high ground . Second , it had to be on Route 495 , an expressway running to northern New England , but it also had to be near the Massachusetts Turnpike . And third , it had to have several oversized barns . From various contacts I finally got an explanation of what this was all about . One of my sources explained , " It 's a hell of a good idea . There 's the big interstate truck transfer terminal near Route 495 and the Massachusetts Turnpike , and the boys do a lot of hijacking around there . They even heist whole truck trailers of stuff like meat , TV sets , liquor , beer and refrigerators . The barns would be a perfect place to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The high ground would make it easy to watch the approaches . " I was promised $30,000 a year if I would set up the dude ranch and " front " it . I began to research the deal as carefully as I was looking into the cemetery proposition . I actually found three locations that I reported to the organization . But by October , 1966 , Tom Sullivan was beginning to fret . At one of our meetings he said , " I 'm worried about you . You ca n't stall forever . You 've got to give them an answer soon about these deals , and I ca n't advise you what to do . It 's risky , so you 'll have to make up your own mind about whether or not you 're really going into business with them . " As it turned out , events took the decision out of my hands . Early in October there was a revolt among the " , . irekers , " which is what the Mafia its non-Mafia killers and mii , cle1 , .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut to death , and , acting on a tip , the Boston police went to Ralph Lamattina 's Nite-Lite Cafe . They found him in the hack room trying to cover bullet holes in the wall with a mirror . A bullet in the wall matched the bullets in the bodies of the victims . Lamattina was charged with being an accessory after the fact of murder . He was given a sentence of 10 to 14 years in prison . So with Lamattina suddenly out of circulation . and with no one else in the Mafia hierarchy familiar with my operations , the cemetery and dude-ranch propositions apparently were simply forgotten . There no longer was anyone pressuring me to make my decisions . Still , I was known to have been approved by Lamattina , so I was allowed to move freely about in the Mafia underworld . I reported to the FBI for another month  --  until November , 1966 . By then the information I was developing was focusing more and more on Mafia corruption of New England state and local officials . I felt this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I told the bureau so . I suggested going to state law-enforcement people , and the bureau agreed . Actually . with my frayed nerves and lack of money . I really wanted to quit , leave town and look for a job . But I thought for a while about all the information I had gathered . and I went to see my former polo partner and commanding officer in the National Guard , Gen. Daniel Needham . The general , now a distinguished attorney and a former commissioner of state police in Massachusetts . is vice president of the New England Citizens Crime Commission , a privately supported group that is the successor to the old Watch and Ward Society , which used to fight crime as well as ban books in Boston . General Needham became so interested in my story that he immediately called in Elliot Richardson . the lieutenant governor of Massachusetts , who was then running for attorney general . Richardson asked me if I 'd continue to do my undercover work for him for another eight months . I said I was broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be financed by contributions from members of the crime commission and others . On November 8 , Richardson was elected attorney general . On the morning of November 9 I had my last meeting with FBI Agent Sullivan at the North Station . I told him I 'd be reporting to Richardson after that . but that Richardson would forward anything that involved federal jurisdiction . Sullivan and I shook hands , and I have n't seen him since . With the money from the crime commission coming in regularly . I was now able to devote full time to my intelligence work . For the benelit of Irving Kaye , my office-mate , the commission saw that I got two new public-relations clients  --  although they were fictitious  --  to account for my sudden burst of activity and new affluence . I saw less and less of Kaye . who had been ailing since the arrest of Lamattina . The Mafia continued to leave me alone , and I was able to concentrate on obtaining evidence from new informants I had learned about . The first of these informants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? for the Malia . Ile also pi-Ileum-I girls for members of a state legislature whose favor the mob wanted to curry . Well call him Mike the Pimp . I le knew me as Frank I IcGregor , an Associated Press reporter writing a bisik on organized crime . I still had my AP card from my newspaper days in Ver . mont , and I had it . copied , adding the year 1967 and the name " Frank McGregor . " I was able to use this approach because the Mafia Operates at several layers that are insulated from each other , The Charles Grinnell of the Ralph Lamattina deals was totally unknown on Ntlike the Pimp 's level . Mike the Pimp , moreover , was a chronic malcontent , who , I figured , would talk to any newspaperman who paid him , So I became Frank McGregor , I paid Mike the Pimp. and he talked . A second informant was a businessman with a history not unlike my own . He had gotten into a financial jam and was hooked by Mafia loan sharks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he agreed to " front " a so-called legitimate business for the organization . He dealt regularly with several high-ranking Mafiosi in his operation , and he had an uncanny sense of what was going on in the hierarchy . I think he talked to me out of shame and desperation . My third principal informant was an echo out of my past . In 1959 , after returning to Boston from Vermont , I joined with a half dozen other men and Father Kenneth B. Murphy , a Catholic priest . to found Rescue Inc .. a suicide-prevention service . We manned a telephone around the clock to take calls from people who were contemplating suicide . We tried to talk them out of killing themselves , and we arranged psychiatric treatment for them when the immediate crisis had passed . One of my Rescue patients in those days was a young man I suspected of being a hood-him . I was not too surprised when I ran into him again in the Mafia . I had saved his life twice , and when I asked him for information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead from gangland bullets . From November , 1966 , to July , 1967 , I found myself running a neat little intelligence network . If anything . there was more tension for me in this phase of my undercover work than when I had been reporting to the FBI . The financial worries were gone , true , but now I was dealing mostly with hoods , who might be less restrained in their reactions than their bosses , if they found me out . I worried constantly , for example , that Mike the Pimp would double-cross me . I never drove my car ( provided by the crime commission ) without watching in the rearview mirror to see if I had picked up a tail , and I had the motor souped up for quick bursts of speed . At home I kept my .38 with me at all times , even at night when I could n't sleep  --  which was often  --  and sat up reading . Eventually , my doctor had to prescribe pills to control the nervous spasms in my stomach . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public with hoodlums more and more , and they began to wonder about me . But I kept working , and from my own observations and from my informants , I began to put together an incredible picture of crime and corruption throughout the New England area . There was a lot of information I did n't understand , and I relied on the advice and opinions of two law-enforcement men whom I knew and trusted  --  Police Chief William Costello of Concord . Mas.s. , and Capt . Andrew Monti , chief or stall services for the Vermont State Police . Whenever I finished a written report , I 'd phone Attorney General Richard-son 's office in the statehouse , and his administrative assistant . Walter Parker , would meet me in a restaurant near the capitol . We 'd have coffee , and I 'd pass the report to Parker under the table . Sometimes I 'd meet Parker 's secretary , Barbara Rose . on the street outside the statehouse and hand her the report . In all , I filed 18 reports with Richardson . I not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England but I identified many of its allies in business and politics . I told about Mafia " legitimate " enterprises . including cleaning and dyeing stores , bars and a variety of other businesses . I reported on police " bagmen " ? a patrolman , sergeant , lieutenant and sometimes a captain  --  in a New England city who receive from $600 to $1,000 a month to allow Mafia-owned night spots to remain open after hours . I named high-ranking New England politicians  --  licensing officials , a couple of court officials and a number of others whom the mob considers to be in its pay , through campaign contributions or outright bribes . I reported on a hidden vault built into the bathroom wall of a Mafia loan shark 's luxurious suburban apartment , and how the Mafia furnishes horse-race results to bookies through an illegal race wire , at rates ranging from $5 to $25 per result , I discovered a narcotics smuggling route from Montreal to Boston ( Routes 7 , 89 and 93. entering the U.S. in Vermont ) , and a booming Mafia business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security in loan-shark transactions and then sells for many thousands of dollars ) . I named several people dangerously in hock to the Mafia , including professional sports figures and a police consultant . As early as January . 1967 , 1 mentioned that a Mafia strong-arm man named Joe Barboza might eventually sing in prison . A few months later he did sing  --  to the FBI  --  and as a result , Raymond Patriarca , Jerry Angiulo and Henry Tameleo , three leaders of the New England Mafia , as identified in McClellan committee testimony . were indicted on charges involving murder . , Angiulo was found not guilty . Patriarca and Tameieo were scheduled to be tried early this month . ) In December , 1966 , I reported that the mob was getting many of its handguns in Nashua and Manchester , N.H. I named the chief Mafia gun procurer in Nashua . One of my informants heard that a high-level Mafioso in Boston had put in a rush order to Nashua for four silencers  --  two for a .38 and tWo for a .45 . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Hampshire and Boston was suddenly closed down by state police . In my seventh report I described the 411 Lounge on Columbus Avenue in Boston , owned by Abraham Sarkis , a Mafia gambling licensee of Syrian descent who is known as the Numbers King of Boston . A few months later the 411 Lounge was raided by Internal Revenue Service agents , and Sarkis was arrested on federal gambling charges . The case has since been dismissed . Sarkis is now awaiting trial on charges of income-tax evasion . ) These are only a few of the benefits that may have been derived from my one-year mission . In intelligence work you just give information pointing in a certain direction , and it is combined with other bits and pieces . You never find out what use your particular bits and pieces have been , and it is difficult to establish a cause-and-effect relationship . My mission ended quietly , and by prearrangement , on July I , 1967 . By then , Attorney General Richardson had formed his own intelligence unit under his new criminal-division chief . Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crime Commission . Richardson and Rogovin and General Needham simply thanked me privately for my effort , and it was over . I did n't want to remain in undercover work . It was too much of an ordeal . I had hoped that the entire interlude would just fade away . but , after ignoring me for months , the Mafia made one more attempt to use me . It heard I was under consideration to become executive director of the New England Citizens Crime Commission . Irving Kaye passed along the word that the " outfit " was delighted at the prospect of having me in the post . But I withdrew my name from consideration for the job , and returned , instead , to my old profession of journalism . I am left with many lasting effects of my undercover experience . I have an ulcer and I know fear . I still carry a gun . I realize I 'm taking a chance by telling my story now , but my friends in law enforcement have advised me that I may actually be safer after revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk attacking a man whose story was known so widely to the public and the police . But even more than the fear , I feel compelled to educate people about the seriousness of the Mafia conspiracy , which I learned the hard way . During my undercover assignment I was shocked at the apathy of the business community and the public to the war on organized crime , which I consider to be second in importance only to the war in Vietnam . There are business leaders in Boston who refused to contribute to the crime commission fund that financed my intelligence mission ; they said they were afraid their names would be made public if I were shot or found floating in Boston Harbor . There are others who will not clean up Mafia bookies and loan sharks in their factories . because " we do n't want to have trouble with the unions who are friendly with the mob . " There are others who openly consort with Mafia leaders . They seem to get a vicarious thrill out of aeneiating with killers or doing business with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " legit . " They refuse to realize , as I now know , that where mob money goes . mob tactics always follow . Worst of all is the contribution of the public to the principal box office of the Mafia  --  the corner bookie . For example , in the suburban town of Wellesley , Mass. , highly paid executives , who are the mainstays of their churches , proudly flaunt the Mafia football and basketball betting cards they have bought in Boston . They think nothing of it . but pious Wellesley , through its seemingly innocent sports betting , is pouring more than a thousand dollars a week into the treasury of the Cosa Nostra . Multiply Wellesley by 10,000 other towns and cities and you know how the Mafia stays in business .
