NASA scientists continue to glow over Gemini 10 's space success , but key questions remain . Almost continuous debriefing of Astronauts John Young and Mike Collins has pinpointed but not solved the two major " gliches " - fuel shortage and eye watering-that almost snarled the threeday , record-setting flight . <P> Brute-Force Buttonhook . The fuel problem arose during Gemini 10 's tricky fourth-orbit rendezvous with Agena 10 . To determine the final thrust required for the interception , Young and Collins used data from the on-board radar , inertial guidance and computer system . In some as yet unknown way , the system produced a figure nearly 7 ft. per sec. greater than the figure radioed up from ground control . When Collins ' own slide-rule tabulation agreed with the spacecraft guidance system , Command Pilot Young chose to go with the double-checked on-board answer . <P> <P> Ten minutes into the maneuver , Young realized that he had overthrust and was headed into an orbit aiming him several miles behind and above the Agena . Jamming his control stick down , Young dived the spacecraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trajectory . He failed , but finally did manage to swerve the spacecraft into a nearly normal " buttonhook " rendezvous . Though his quick thinking saved the maneuver , the incident burned up 268 more lbs . of precious propellant than mission plans had anticipated . <P> Spectacular Views . Engineers remain stumped over what pungent substance irritated the crew 's eyes during Collins ' first EVA ( extra vehicular activity ) . One new suggestion is that urine somehow invaded the breathing lines , but the Gemini 10 spacemen quickly vetoed that theory , insisting that the eye-swelling fumes were in no way similar to urine . One guess now is that the special antifog mist wiped on both space-suit visors prior to the EVA reacted chemically with particles of lithium hydroxide ( used to purify the astronauts ' breathing system ) . <P> Mission photographs were disappointing-the team brought back no movies or still pictures of Collins ' two EVAs or of the earth from the 476-mile record apogee . Young 's films of the space walk showed nothing but blurry blue sky . Ironically , the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spacecraft with a free-floating camera . Even so , NASA officials were quick to point out that the crew did shoot the first daylight pictures of a docked Gemini-Age-na-and one of the most spectacular views of the earth 's curvature ever seen by nonastronauts ( see color pages ) . <P> Even more ambitious flight plans are now being polished for Commander Charles Conrad ( command pilot ) and Lieut . Commander Richard Gordon ( pilot ) , who are scheduled to launch in Gemini 11 shortly after Labor Day . To be attempted : <P> &gt; A tricky first orbit rendezvous over the Pacific with an Agena launched before the Gemini , simulating the critical Apollo-Lunar Excursion Module moon rendezvous . <P> <P> &gt; A record 860-mile apogee for two or three orbits-considerably higher than Gemini 10 's top apogee . <P> &gt; One full space walk ( at lower altitudes ) during which Pilot Gordon will manipulate a battery-operated wrench to fasten and unfasten several bolts on a plate outside the spacecraft .               @ @ @ @ @ @
