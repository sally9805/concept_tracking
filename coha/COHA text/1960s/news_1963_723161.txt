txt Mayor Wagner announced yesterday that a favorable turn of events in the last month had produced a $26,250,000 windfall for the city . He said an $18,250,000 rise in General Fund revenues above April 15 estimates was in prospect . And he reported that the city gained $8,000,000 in real estate taxing authority under new equalization rates , still tentative , announced by the state on Friday . The added income will put the Wagner administration within striking distance of balancing the record budget of $3,093,641 , -i 582 without proposing another round of taxation . A public outcry against Mayor Wagner 's $236,100,000 tak package , proposed in early April , led to his decision a week ago to drop the out-of-city sales tax on the ground that it would strike heavily against businessmen . The elimination of that tax source , which was to have raised $40,000,000 , threw the budget out of balance and led to a hectic round of conferences both in the City Council and in the Board of Estimate . The Mayor 's statement on the improved fiscal outlook was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budget . The board has no vote on taxes , but it could put the budget in balance now with only $13,750,000 in reductions . He Notes Sources The $18,250,000 increase in General Fund revenues , Mayor Wagner reported , would result from the following upward re visions of original estimates : cThe yield from the occu-1 panty tax on commercial rentals , set first at $60,000,000 , was " safely increased by $8,000,000 " on the basis that the 23/4 per cent rate on rents below $2,500 a year would not cut revenue as much as first thought . 41The estimate of the general business tax went up $5 , - 000,000 above the original $174 , - 900,000 by virtue of Governor Rockefeller 's veto of a bill that would have exempted certaini food processors . qProceeds from the sale of unused city property , better known as " in rem " sales , were raised $5,000,000 above the $14 , - 000,000 estimate because of the release of property on Staten Island that certain city agencies at first sought . q  --  The city tax on admissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - 1200,000 , will raise $250,000 additional because the Belmont Park meeting this year will be held at Aqueduct , which is in the city . The increase in the city 's realestate taxing power derives from the fact that such taxation is limited to 21 per cent of the latest five-year average of full valuation of taxable real estate , funded debt service excluded . Last Friday , the State Board of Equalization advised the city that its tentative equalization rate was 74 per cent compared with 77 per cent for the last year . The equalization rate represents the relationship between assessed valuations fixed by the city and the State board 's estimate of the full value of property in the city . The net effect was to raise the fifth-year figure on full valuation and thus the five-year average , expanding the city 's taxing power on real estate by an indicated $8,000,000 .
