As of now , the Eagle screams . <P> In the first week of America 's Cup trials on Long Island Sound , the Aurora Syndicate 's brand-new American Eagle sailed off across the starting line seven times-and seven times came home victorious . It was all just practice as far as the New York Yacht Club was concerned . The boat that will defend the 113-year-old America 's Cup against Britain 's Sovereign or Kurrewa V will not be picked until after the final trials off Newport in August . But in the meantime , American Eagle was doing a pretty good job of " selecting " herself . In the New York Yacht Club 's annual spring regatta , she whipped both Columbia and Constellation , the other highly touted new twelve . Then , in head-to-head races , she beat them both again and took two straight from Ted Hood 's Nefertiti . Finally , to top off her week , she really rubbed it in against Constellation-by the embarrassing margin of 5 min. 31 sec . <P> <P> Strong &; Straight . Blue-water yachtsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . Eagle was only 18 days old when she won her first race . Her architect , A. E. ( " Bill " ) Luders , 55 , had never designed a 12-meter racing yacht before . Her skipper , William Cox , 51 , was supposed to be a small-boat sailor at heart , had not handled a twelve in 27 years . And her young crew was so nervous that when they tried to set a spinnaker , they dropped the pole bang onto Eagle 's deck . <P> But all that seemed academic once Eagle started racing . Aiming for an all-weather boat , Designer Luders had purposely given Eagle a low center of gravity to make her point higher in high winds , a shortened keel to lessen drag in light air . In gusty , 15-knot breezes , she stood straight as a shark 's fin ; and she ghosted gently through pockets of virtual calm , finding momentum where none seemed possible . In all of the seven races , Skipper Cox outmaneuvered his rivals at the start , pouring backwind into their sails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tacking duels , he and his crew strutted some impressive stuff . In one contest , on the second day of the trials , Constellation tacked 17 times in 20 minutes . Eagle covered so efficiently that she gained an average of 2 sec. on each tack . <P> Do n't Blame the Boat . The other boats were still far from disgraced . Columbia , gem of the 1958 America 's Cup but badly outclassed in the 1962 trials , regained enough of her glitter under New Skipper Walter Podolak to beat Nefertiti and Constellation-the Californian 's first victories in America 's Cup competition . Constellation herself , with a record of two victories and five defeats , was still in the running . The only real disappointment was Ted Hood 's Nefertiti . Glamour boat of the 1962 trials , the beamy Marblehead yacht got all the way to the finals before losing out to Weatherly , and many experts felt that Nefertiti was the better boat , credited Weatherly 's victory mostly to the remarkable helmsmanship of Skipper Bus Mosbacher.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
