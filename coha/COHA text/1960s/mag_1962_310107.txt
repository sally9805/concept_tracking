" The moment a man questions the meaning and value of life , " wrote Sigmund Freud in a letter to Princess Marie Bonaparte , " he is sick . " <P> By that token , and according to the findings of Psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl of the University of Vienna , Americans really need to have their heads examined . Addressing the annual meeting of the Academy of Religion and Mental Health in Manhattan a fortnight ago , Dr. Frankl said that psychoanalysts are more and more frequently encountering a new neurosis characterized by loss of interest and lack of initiative , against which conventional psychoanalysis is ineffective . <P> " Time and again , the psychiatrist is consulted by patients who doubt that life has any meaning , " said Dr. Frankl . " This condition I have called ' existential vacuum . ' " And in a survey of his own students , Dr. Frankl found that while 40% of the Germans , Swiss and Austrians report existential vacuum , no less than 81% of the Americans say they have felt it . <P> Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the existential vacuum is predominantly an American disease , but rather that it is apparently a concomitant of industrialization . " It results , he thinks , from a loss of the instinctual security of the animal world on the one hand and of social tradition on the other . " At present , instincts do not tell man what he has to do , nor do traditions direct him toward what he ought to do ; soon he will not even know what he wants to do , thus completely succumbing to conformism.
