txt MAIL : SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY MRS . ARTHUR WILLIAMS.MRS . RAYMOND G. RHILE.BRIAN C. RIED.MRS . VICTORIA V. WOR .. MAIL : SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY To the Travel Editor : WE hear about so many unpleasant experiences that the motorist has while traveling in the South that I thought you would like to hear of a pleasant one for a change . En route home from Florida last week , we stopped at Fayetteville , N. C. , to do some shopping . As we parked , a police officer ( Post , by name ) placed a courtesy card on our car , . explaining that this meant we could park all flay without putting any money in the meter . The officer himself was very friendly and courteous . My husband and I felt this hospitable act should be given recognition , hence this letter . MRS . ARTHUR WILLIAMS . Union City , N. J. A SMALL SINGLE To the Travel Editor : Speaking of , the extra charge for single rooms , why not divide a double room in half and charge exactly half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' tiny a room is , but they do object to bunking in with . a stranger . They tell you not to pick up hitchhikers in your car , but no one questions your sharing sleeping quarters with someone you have never laid eyes on before . When you travel , you go to get away from people ; you want to choose and pick your company , and to have the privilege of rejecting them , if that is your pleasure . So let us have a " matchboxsize " room at half the price of a large , double-size room , and let us preserve our privacy , which is valued above rubies . No one should have to pay a penalty because he occasionally has the , desire , or there is a necessity for him , to travel alone . MRS . RAYMOND G. RHILE . Philadelphia . HALF-SIZE CUBES To the Travel Editor : Mr. Dean Carpenter 's logic and facts about a single occupant in a hotel room using as much space and equipment as two occupants of the same room are immaculate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to be incapable of building some halfsize cubes of space  --  in the new New York Hilton , for example ? Even the Y. M. C. A. manages to succeed in this endeavor . BRIAN C. RIED . New York . FOR MODEST ROOMS To the Travel Editor : I should like to endorse cordially the sentiments expressed by Mr. Willard Johnson in the Travel Section of July 22 , and approved later by Mrs. Thomas H. Truslow , in regard to luxury motels . Courtesy of Policeman In Fayetteville Noted ? Sizes of Rooms It is understandable that those constructing these luxury units have to charge high rates , and are asking all that traffic can bear . It seems that there aee many traveling people who can afford to enjoy these expensive surroundings , but there are many who can not . Perhaps some investors could cater to the public who , like Myself , wish clean , comfortable , attractive and convenient quarters , without the frills and at lower cost . I have heaW numbers of people rejoice that motels were to be a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are out-of-bounds for those who can spend limited amounts on vacations . I am all for the luxury motels for those who want them , but I do hope a trend will arise for more reasonable accommodations , too . MRS . VICTORIA V. WORDEN . Dover , Del . SIMPLE COMFORT To the Travel Editor : It is true that the American motoring public has recently had little alternative other than to accept the high prices charged for overnight accommodations at our luxury motels . Without disturbing the present set-up in the least , I am sure that there is an appreciable segment of motor travelers who would prefer and support more reasonable accommodations featuring cleanliness , plus a bath and comfortable bed . The location does not have to be on a main highway , but it should be well advertised , with explicit directions as to its easy and specific accessibility . I applaud and concur in the stand taken by Mr. Johnson and Mrs. Truslow , and I am sure that we represent an extensive group who would be the constant clientele of any chain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis . DENOYELLES C I IRISTIE . New City , N. Y. A CHILD TOURIST To the Train Editor : I am 14 years old and am writing in reference to Mrs. Davitz ' article about traveling abroad with children . The Da- , vitzes seem to have taken al tour of Europe , spending only one or two days in one spot . When I was 8 years old , my parents took myself e and my two sisters , ages 6 and 11 , to Europe far a two-month trip . In our stay , we did not travel every two days , but we stayed in areas we . found charming fox extended periods of time . These long stays in one resort were enjoyable to my parents , as well as to me . It is impossible to think that a child of early age can enjoy traveling from day to day from one city to another . Whet . I went to Europe , we spent about 75 per cent of- our time in the mountains and in the beautiful resorts , and the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bern , - Vienna and Brussels . I learned a great deal from this trip , and the memories bring many happy thoughts . It is because of this trip , and because my parents ' enjoyed it as much as we did , that I feel that adults must think more about both parties involved in such a trip before going about taking it . THOMAS NOETHER . Short Hills , N. J. NO SETBACKS To the Travel Editor : After reading the article by Lois Jean Davitz concerning the " Perils of Visiting Europe with Junior , " I was thoroughly burnt up . Last year , my 6-year-old daughter and I had a marvelous trip all through Europe , and not by car . We went everywhere for three months . Not once did she get an upset stomach , a cold or any other childish setback . She loved the various foods , which I , of course , was careful to choose , and for lunches and snacks we just went into a bakery or delicatessen and got what we wanted , thus having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see everything , as seems to be the case with Mrs. Davitz . We took things very easy , and what we did not see will be for another time , if ever we get back to Europe . We took turns in doing things that each of us liked . For example , one day we went to see the changing of the guard in London ; another day , we went shopping in the big stores . When we went to see the Eiffel Tower in Paris , I did not bother to make my daughter climb up to the top . We just bought a souvenir and went for a nice boat ride along the Seine . This way , a trip can be made extremely enjoyable for a 6-year-old and no burden to the parent . My daughter remembers many things that I had forgotten , so do not think that every child prefers his own backyard and familiar surroundings . I am all for taking the children along . * * * MRS .
