THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE were overtaken by a sense of gullibility the other week on reading in the Times that General Motors was calling in two hundred and sixty-nine thousand of its brand-new 1967 Chevrolets , Buicks , Pontiacs , and Oldsmobiles , all of them in the hands of motorists ; according to a company spokesman , a " slight " misalignment in the steering shaft had been discovered in eight of the cars . Our reception of this news was the same as it had been on other such occasions , when Ford or Chrysler or Kaiser Jeep or some other company had pleaded fallibility at the drawing hoard , Once again we were filled with admiration for the seemingly exemplary fashion in which an automobile manufacturer was owning up to his product 's shortcomings . How forthright , we thought , how public-spirited of General Motors to call in so many cars when so few were known to be at fault ! How much expense the company was putting itself to in order to redress so " slight " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Times ' extensive account that our flow of admiration came to a halt , for at that point the reporter entered the thought that the company 's cry of mess culia was no voluntary act but a confession wrung by a recent federal statute that obliges auto manufacturers to disclose any defects in their merchandise to the National Traffic Safety Agency , the reporter going on to observe , " General Motors apparently has decided that making its own announcement is preferable to allowing the Federal Government to disclose the defect data . " Since recovering from our bout of gullihility , we have found ourself reacting less to the minimizing style of the company 's spokesman than to the permissiveness of the government 's law , whose effect , as far as we can make out , is to legalize the sale of uncontrollable vehicles before their defects need be revealed . By this standard , it seems to us , one could argue that the aircraft industry is entitled to its fair share of crackups before ironing out any lingering hugs in its new models  --  including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government 's law impresses us as curiously tolerant and easygoing  --  qualities that , conceivably , reflect a widespread reluctance to impugn the mechanical safety of so well-established a cultural staple as the automobile . However that may be , the country , as matters stand , is engaged in an immense game of Chicken , its players steering with wheels that may snap or stepping on accelerators that may jam . Given present legislation , the buyer has too much to beware of , for nowadays buying a new car can he tantamount to enlisting as a test driver . One 's car is a mystery . We are acquainted with a woman who has n't known what to make of her station wagon since its brakes failed one morning last summer as she was nearing the busiest street on Martha 's Vineyard . Nothing crossed the car 's path , as it happened , but since that morning she has found that a certain element of suspense attends her driving . " I think every state trooper may be keeping an eye on my station wagon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ten most wanted cars in the country . " THE great difficulty in keeping up with science these days is that the wrong discoveries usurp the headlines . We ca n't help feeling that stories of great interest are being overlooked or only scantily reported . Our attention was recently called to a pair of such stories by an agent we maintain out inslide-rtde-and-caliper country to keep us abreast of things . Each of the two stories appeared as a single paragraph in a column called " Science News-front " in the January issue of Popular Science , rubbing shoulders with such items as " What Makes Engine Oil Good ' ? " and " He Feeds Cows  --  by Computer . " Our agent felt they deserved greater prominence , and so do we . The first , in its entirety , runs : Does UHF radiation from TV and radar transmitters affect your nervous system ? It 's possible , studies on the behavior of rats indicate . To test the theory , Dr. Susan Korbel of the University of Arkansas exposed rats to the Low radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transmitter at frequencies between 320 and 947 MHz for periods ranging from a few weeks to two months . Dr. Korbel reports that UHF-irradiated rats were overactive and showed more " emotionality " than control rats . The period of hyperactivity was followed by consistent long-term lethargic behavior . The possibility that television 's power to irritate and stupefy extends to people who are not looking at it strikes us as truly interesting news , and we hope Dr. ! Corbel presses on with her investigations . That hope does not apply to the investigator whose work gave rise to the second story : A kitchen rigged with accident-causing booby traps provided investigators with new insights into home accidents . A project , recently conducted by Joan S. Guilford of the American Institutes of Research , Los Angeles , used a kitchen with such things as a rubber ball left on the floor , unplugged appliances set on " high , " spilled coffee , protruding towel racks , scalding tap water , and items placed on shelves too high to reach . The kitchen was prearranged , Dr. Guilford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity for accident-avoiding behavior . " The 226 subjects of the experiment  --  who thought they were testing the kitchen layout  --  experienced 714 accidents ( none serious ) . Most frequent were bumps and falls ( 264 ) , followed by burns or scalds , and cuts and jabs . That works out to more than three injuries per person . Dr. Guilford 's complacent wholesale deception raises an interesting question  --  whether one is obliged to excuse behavior in a scientist that one would never excuse in a layman . If Dr. Guilford had played her injurious little trick on two hundred and twenty-six victims merely for a joke , or out of spite , the public would have taken a very severe view of her actions . We do n't see why the standards of common decency should be automatically suspended for anyone who has a degree and an institute and a passion for observation and a clipboard , and who chooses to call the victims " subjects " and takes careful notes on their discomfiture . If Dr. Guilford is really in the dark about such perplexing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a kitchen 's safety , we suggest that she try asking somebody , since what is dark to one may he as clear as day to another . Friends WE spent a sunny afternoon last week rambling through Central Park with Miss Celeste Holm , the actress , and Mr. Richard Edes Harrison , the cartographer , amateur ornithologist , and former president of the Linnaean Society , while they explained why they belong to a new organization called Friends of Central Park , which has as its purpose the preservation of the Park as a natural landscape and the education of the public about its history . " The Friends of Central Park is something like the Friends of Prospect Park , the latter being a group that was organized eight months ago and now has nearly seven hundred members , " said Mr. Harrison , who was wearing a bushy heard , a gra suit , a tweed cap , and a striped bow tie . " Our membership fee is two dollars a year , and we welcome everyone interested in keeping Central Park as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams rather than as a setting for more buildings , monuments , permanent athletic fields , and assorted fantasies dreamed up by determined philanthropists anxious to have their names imbedded everlastingly in concrete . " Miss Holm , meanwhile , was picking up litter along a path on the west side of the Park above the Lake , acquiring cigarette packs , beer cans , newspapers , and a discarded paper shopping bag . She wore black loafers , black stockings , a black cloth coat , a red turtleneck sweater , and a black tam-o ' - shanter , which slipped to the side of her head each time she bent down , and she was followed by a black-and-white poodle named Maestro . " Miss Holm is secretary of the Friends , " Mr. Harrison said . " It 's an honorary position , but , as you can see , she gets down to the grass roots . " " Halm , " said Miss Holm as she picked up several empty pop bottles and an assortment of sandwich wrappers . " Pm beginning to look as though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " We want to see more money spent on keeping the Park clean and green , on planting and landscaping , " Mr. Harrison went on . " Most of the people who come here just want to walk or sit , to escape from the pavement , noise , and smells of the city . A natural park is its own magnet ; it does n't need Happenings , recreation centers , and all the contrived amusements that could easily be put elsewhere : . Fortunately , Happenings come and go , but amusements converted into buildings have a way of remaining . " " I need one of those pointed sticks , " Miss Holm said . " What ever happened to the men with pointed sticks ? " Mr. Harrison frowned . " You see them on Mondays , after people have scattered the Sunday papers all over the Park , " he said . Then , leading her and us to a concrete walk in the Ramble and pointing to muddy gashes in the bank beside the walk , he continued , " Concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water runs straight down the walk and pours directly off the concrete and causes erosion . This should be a gravel pads , and the underbrush should he preserved . For some unfathomable reason , the Department of Parks believes underbrush is bad and removes it , never realizing that it is needed to prevent erosion , especially on steep slopes . " " I do n't know much about erosion , but I can tell you a thing or two about trees , " Miss Hom remarked , retrieving six gum wrappers from the walk . " My grandfather Edmund Gale Jewett , who taught all the natural sciences at Adelphi Academy , in BrIwklyn , showed me how to graft apple trees . He was a grand old man . He used to take me skating in Prospect Park and rock-climbing in Central Park . It 's really because of the things lie taught me that I 'm interested in the Friends . I want people to know that the original concept of this park , as it was defined by the men who Laid it out  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city . " " Let me show you how that country is fast disappearing , " said Mr. Harrison , unfurling a map and raising his eyebrows , which are black and bristly . " Central Park consists of eight hundred and forty acres . Wc estimate nearly three hundred of those acres are taken up with things other than grass and woods . Some of the Friends and I have spent a great deal of time drawing up this map to show exactly what is in the Park . If you study it , you 'll be appalled . Prior to 19011 , there was n't much change in Olmsted 's and Vaux 's plan , but since 1900 sixty-eight acres of walks and drives have been paved , twenty-seven acres of buildings , with parking lots and service drives , have been built , thirty acres of land have been enclosed for restricted use , as tennis courts and ball fields and the like , and six and a half miles of fences have been erected . Then , there are fifteen acres of bridle paths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certainly do n't do any harm , can he used only by riders . And did you know that the Metropolitan Museum , which Olmsted himself did n't want in the Park , takes up twelve acres alone ? Add a hundred acres for the Reservoir and another twelve for the transverses sunken highways . And do n't forget the Lake , the Harlem Meer , and the Pond , at Fifty-ninth Street , which ca n't really he counted as incursions , because they 're natural sites for boating , but which nevertheless take up space . " Mr. Harrison furled the map . " We 're going to give a copy of this to everyone who joins the Friends and to anyone who comes on our summer walking tours . They 'll begin M June , and will he conducted by Henry Hope Reed , the curator of the Park . Mr. Reed is chairman of our organization , just as Clay Lancaster , the curator of Prospect Park , is chairman of the Friends of Prospect Park . Both groups are sponsored by the Greensward Foundation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Lawn , we saw the afternoon sunlight lingering on bare patches of ground . " We want people to re alize that things like the proposed stable-polo-field complex , which would be built on the north edge of this lawn , arc further encroachments on an already diminishing greensward , " Mr. Harrison said . " What about the chicken farm they want to put in Prospect Park ? " asked iss Holm . " The chicken farm -- excuse me , the animal farm  --  proposed by Abraham &; Straus is a fiscal monstrosity , " Mr. Harrison said . " It will cost two hun dred and thirty thousand dollars , of which A. &; S. will donate ninety thousand and the city will pay a hundred and forty thousand , and the city will also pay ninety thousand a year maintenance . That money should go , instead , to keeping Prospect Park in better shape as it is . And the stablepolo-field complex in Central Park will cost about six ' million dollars . I 'm not against polo , but an indoor polo field does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Metropolitan Opera in the Park . People who go to polo games will just go there and then leave ; they 're not interested in walking or sitting in the Park . Why ca n't the money he used for grass , and for the care of dying trees , and for getting rid of litter ? " " Chin up , " said Miss Holm , handing him the shopping bag , filled with trash . ? QIGN observed in the window of a L-.7 brand-new specialty shop on Madison Avenue : PRE-OPENING CLEARANCE SALE Now Garden THE new Madison Square Garden , under construction on the grave of the old Pennsylvania Railroad Station , will not be completed until autumn , but we 've given it a preliminary inspection in order to report on how things are shaping up . The new Garden , which occupies the western portion of the two-block area hounded by Seventh Avenue , Eighth Avenue , Thirty-first Street , and Thirty-third Street , is part of the Madison Square Garden Center , which will include a twenty-nine-story office building going up on Seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred and fifty-three feet high , with a diameter of four hundred and twenty-five feet and a circumference of thirteen hundred and thirty-five feet . The south side of the Garden 's steel frame has now been sheathed with huff-colored concrete panels , which we think give it the look of a gigantic snare drum , but when we arrived at the site the other day we heard some other opinions . A man muttered to no one in particular that the building resembled an oil-storage tank , and a woman told a companion that it reminded her of a hatbox . Vie did this eavesdropping as we were making our way along Thirty-first Street to the field office of Charles Luckman Associates , the architects of the building , to keep an appointment with Mr. Sherman Schneider , who helped design it , and who has been project architect since its inception , in the autumn of 1961 . Mr. Schneider is a soft-spoken , bespectacled man in his middle thirties , and when we asked him how he would describe the new Garden , he smiled and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated functional requirements . " The shape of the Garden was determined by the need to design a main arena that would provide good sight lines and unobstructed vision for twenty thousand-odd people watching hockey games , basketball games , circuses , or ice shows , " he continued . " On the basis of studies in sight-line genmetry , we concluded that the seating arrangement around the arena floor should be oval , and since we already knew that unobstructed vision would require a clear-span roof , we decided to erect the simplest and most economical kind a roof supported on cables strung in a circular configuration . Cable-supported roofs have been around for some time , but this is the first one in Manhattan , and it 's one of the largest in the United States . It 's more easily explained when looked at , so let 's head over there . " As we left the field office and crossed Thirty-first Street , Mr. Schneider went on to say that from the point of view of design and structural engineering the new Garden is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundations was a staggering project that started in the spring of 1964 and took nearly a year , " he told us . " We not only had to fit the circular pattern of the building into the rectangular grid of the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks and platforms below but had to accomplish that without disrupting train service . Then , before demolishing the old , aboveground station , we had to pour an immense concrete slab beneath it to serve as a roof for the new , underground station . That took ten months . Finally , a year ago , we erected the first steel column of the framework of the Garden , and since that time , as you can see , things have moved right along . " He glanced up at a concrete slab that was dangling a hundred feet above us from the boom of a giant crane , and then led us along a taxi drive that runs from Thirty-first Street to Thirty-third between the Garden and the office building . Here we passed an entrance to the subterranean railroad station , from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being assaulted from all sides and above by a deafening cacophony , of whining saws , roaring concrete mixers , and screaming air compressors . On the far side of the entrance , Schneider turned left and started up a truck ramp leading into the Garden . " What a mess ! " he exclaimed cheerfully , surveying the interior of the building , where huge , unfinished walls , ceilings , floors , and staircases were swarming with workmen and cluttered with scaffolding , mounds of debris , and piles of construction materials . " This ramp rises all the way to the floor of the main arena , which is fifty-two feet above street level , " he went on . " In between are four staggered levels , into which we 've crammed , among other things , a large truck-loading area for the radroad station , a spacious ticket lobby for the Garden , a forty-eight-lane bowling center , a five-thousand-seat movie theatre , and a five-thousand-seat amphitheatre , which will he used for theatrical productions , tennis matches , and other events too small for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramp , Schneider pointed out a tall escalator tower  --  one of four such towers , rising at regular intervals against the Garden 's exterior  --  and then , on the fourth level , showed us some giant girders , which support the floor of the main arena and consequently provide roofs for the amphitheatre and bowling center beneath it . " The longest of these girders has a span of a hundred and seventy-five feet and a weight of ninety-six tons , and it is the largest girder ever used in a New York City building , " he said . At the top of the ramp , we followed Schneider out onto the floor of the main arena , and found ourself in a vast steel-framed amphitheatre , looking up at the sky through a layer of cables draped in a catenary from the upper and outer rim of the budding to a hublike ring resting on a tall scaffold in the center of the floor . " This gives you a fine view of the three main components of a cable-suspended roof  --  the outer ring , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here the outer ring , which is called the compression ring , rests upon the building 's forty-eight perimeter columns . It is made up of forty-eight rectangular steel sections that weigh twenty-four tons apiece . The inner ring , which is called the tension ring , is resting on temporary staging at the moment . It is thirty-four feet in diameter , weighs a hundred and four tons , and has forty-eight radial arms . Each of the cables  --  there are forty-eight of them  --  is three and three-quarters inches in diameter and weighs three and a half tons . The outer ends of the cables are bolt connections that pass through sleeves in the compression ring and are anchored on the outside by giant spanner nuts . The inner ends of the cables are fastened to the arms of the tension ring by pin-and-shackle connections . When the roof has been decked and finished , the scaffold supporting the tension ring will be removed and the roof will be on its own . The cables will pull the tension ring outward and the compression ring inward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be in balance , and the weight of the roof will be transferred equally to the forty-eight perimeter columns . What could he simpler ? " ? OVERHEARD on a N -- / Fifth Avenue bus , distraught matron to sympathetic friend : " All winter long , my begonias have acted as if they did n't even know me . " They Go in Smiling AN attendant hung a red sign reading " QUIET PLEASE CURTAIN UP " on one of the lobby doors of the Morosco Theatre as the final wave of matrons funnelled into the orchestra for last Wednesday 's matinee . One lady handed the tickettaker an extra ticket , saying , " Her name is Mrs. Hughes , and she 's blond , and she has a blond mink coat , " and the ticket-taker said , in a kindly voice , " Do n't worry . I 'll see that she gets it . " The door closed , the show " Do n't Drink the Water " ? began , and the ticket-taker , a tall , benevolent , white-haired man wearing a dark suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the now nearly empty lobby to where a girl in a green coat was standing and staring fretfully out into the street . " I 'm waiting for my husband , " the girl said unhappily . " He 's trying to park . " " It 's quite a problem , parking around here , " the ticket-taker said consolingly . Then he said , " Do n't worry . I tell you what  --  when he comes in , I 'll give you both a little briefing on what you 've missed . " The girl looked relieved and grateful . The man returned to the ticket box and carried it over to the box office , When he returned , a blond woman in a blond mink coat was wandering around the lobby , looking anxious . " Are you Mrs. Hughes ? " the ticket-taker asked . When she nodded , he handed her the stub of the ticket that had been left by her friend , then walked with her to the inside door , saying , in a low , genial voice , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is about a caterer from Newark , New Jersey , and he and his wife and daughter have always gone to Atlantic City for their vacation , but this year his wife 's brother induces them to go to Europe . They land behind the Iron Curtain , and he 's taking pictures of everything in sight . " He went on summarizing , rapidly and enthusiastically . " So they take refuge in the American Consulate , " he was saying as he opened the door for her , " and if they step outside they can get arrested and shot . Now you pick it up from there . " The lady was beaming appreciatively as she disappeared into the dimness . We introduced ourself to the ticket-taker , who told us his name was Samuel J. Freedman , and said he had been briefing latecomers to plays at the Morosco , and other theatres where he had worked , for about six years . " I feel this way , " he said . " I know how disappointed they are when they 're late . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and they go in smiling . " He gave a big smile himself , and then returned to the girl in the green coat and suggested that perhaps she ought to go in , promising that he would tell her husband when he arrived . The girl agreed . " He has a Glen-plaid overcoat , " she said , " and he 'll be running . " Freedman gave the girl a quick briefing and ushered her inside . " I used to he in vaudeville , years ago , " Freedman told us a moment later . " I was born at 329 West Thirty-eighth Street , over in Hell 's Kitchen . It seemed that everybody there was sort of inclined to go into show business . I used to do comedy , sing , dance , do all the dialects , work in blackface and minstrel shows . I was Ward of Raymond Ward , and Freeman of King Sr. Freeman . I 'd be the heavy , and my partner would sing the ballads . I worked places like the American Roof , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savings Bank now  --  and the Dewey Theatre , down around Fourteenth Street . When black-face went out , I went out . I went into bookkeeping , and I played professional baseball for a while , and now  --  now that I 'm retired  --  I 'm back in show business ? " He beamed . " I like it here . It keeps me active . It stops me from getting into that old-age bracket where people injure their life by fear . Fear of illness , fear of everything . When you get older , today is the future . I 've just taken up the uke , and I 'm practicing now . I have n't sung publicly in years . I sing and dance for my grandchildren sometimes . Songs like ' Margie ' and Ai n't She Sweet ? ' Every time I hear music I like , I think I 'm twenty again ! " Freedman swung into a brisk , vigorous tap dance across the floor , his rapid steps echoing through the empty lobby , and ended with a stylish Big Finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the old soft-shoe , " he said , smiling . A young man in a Glen-plaid overcoat came running in from the street and glanced desperately around the lobby . Freedman greeted him , explained that his wife was inside , and guided him toward the door . " I 'll give you a little briefing , " he said reassuringly , in a low voice .
