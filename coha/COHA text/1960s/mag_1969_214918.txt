Ira Charles Magaziner is a former Long Island pizza-eating champion who has prodded Brown University into some of the liveliest academic reforms in the U.S. He did it by sheer intelligence , without manhandling a single dean . Last month Magaziner delivered the senior class valedictory , collected his magna cum laude degree in an interdisciplinary program called Human Studies , twirled his Phi Beta Kappa key and looked ahead to two years at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar . Brown itself looked ahead to sweeping curriculum changes that might never have occurred without Magaziner . <P> Persuasive Logic . Unlike many campus radicals , Magaziner is a first-generation collegian , the grandson of Russian immigrants and the son of an office manager in a tomato-processing plant . He had no sooner arrived at Brown from Lawrence ( N.Y. ) High School than he began shaking up the university . As a freshman , he persuaded the university administration to abolish the unpopular food-contract system , which forced his classmates to pay an annual rate covering all meals . As a sophomore , he organized a seminar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paid $800 from the dean 's special fund to spend a summer writing up the seminar 's recommendations . Result : the 415-page " Magaziner Report , " which Harvard Sociologist David Riesman has called " a herculean effort , an impressive document . " <P> Magaziner 's principal recommendations are that collegians be allowed to choose courses in broad intellectual areas that interest them , rather than follow fixed requirements , and that conventional grades be abolished in favor of " pass " or " no credit . " His report also urges professors to focus on concepts rather than narrow facts , and to work far more closely with individual students . These ideas are not especially original ; Magaziner 's achievement is the persuasive logic of his presentation . <P> Gab and Clout . Though his report got wide attention , Magaziner felt that Brown was slow in carrying it out . As a result , he staged mass rallies to push his reforms , organized three-student teams to work on every faculty member and turned his gift of gab on the administration . As president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ) , he had the clout to mobilize hundreds of disciples with a single telephone call , which set off a chain of calls across the campus . In May , the university finally approved the new curriculum for a two-year experimental period . <P> Magaziner , who wrote his senior honors thesis on " The Decline of Metaphysical Religion and Values in the West , " is now preparing to joust with the authorities at Oxford 's Balliol College . They expect him to follow a traditional doctoral program ; he wants a sweeping , cross-disciplinary plan of his own design . Having already shaken up a 200-year-old university , Magaziner is not much intimidated by one that is three times older . Meantime , back at Brown , his impact can be measured by a widely quoted campus graffito : " Ira , please see me-God . " " You come to me-Ira. "
