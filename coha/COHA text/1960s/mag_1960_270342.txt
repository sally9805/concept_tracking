The credo of Architect Morris Lapidus of Miami Beach is simple and to the point : put your money where it shows . Such cathedrals of pleasure as the Eden Roc , Americana and Fontainebleau ( pronounced Fountain Blue ) hotels give abundant evidence that Lapidus is a disciple of excess . With freewheeling showmanship , he is trying to develop an " alphabet of ornament " that will provoke an emotional revolt against the austerity of modern architecture . In the midway atmosphere of Miami Beach and other resort areas , Lapidus , 57 , finds the perfect outlet for the " new sensuality " expressed in his terrazzoed palazzos . " They call my hotels corn , " he says proudly , " but they 're better than corn . They make people happy , excited , titillated . Vacationers need to feel a sense of adventure . That 's why I build my closets so big : people need big closets emotionally . " <P> Bordello Opulence . Behind Lapidus ' philosophy rests a firm conviction that architecture 's age of simplicity is doomed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that range from borscht-belt baroque to Coney Island modern . With exaggeration that verges on caricature , he splashes his hotels with colorful bordello opulence that offends traditionalists , flabbergasts sophisticates and often delights the uninitiated . Lapidus takes pride in the fact that he gives people " something to gape at . ' ' In fact , he calls his arced , 565-room Fontainebleau a " tasteful three-ring circus . " But the star turn among his hotels is the $17 million Americana , which he designed right down to the bellhops ' uniforms . In the lobby of the hotel is a glass-enclosed terrarium , open on top so that the lobby can be rained into without wetting the guests . " It 's ridiculous to have a glass-enclosed hole in the middle of a building , " admits Lapidus , " but it gives people a lift . It 's the crazy hat for women , the bright tie for men . " <P> Only a Vanderbilt . Lapidus graduated from the Columbia School of Architecture in 1927 , began his career as the shoe-store Frank Lloyd Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into eye-catching display cases . But his lavish future was foreshadowed when a gold , walnut and marble bathroom that he designed for Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt caused her husband to complain : " I 'm only a Vanderbilt , not a Rockefeller ! " By 1943 the fun had gone out of store design , and Lapidus branched into architecture on his own . For several years he worked mainly as a hotel doctor , adding his bright touches to the redesign of resort hotels . In 1954 he got his first major Miami Beach commission , designed the $15 million Fontainebleau . <P> Lapidus followed his Florida successes with the 176-room Arawak Hotel in Jamaica and the 150-room Aruba Caribbean-Casino in the Netherlands West Indies . <P> Despite such million-dollar labors , Lapidus says sadly : " Averagewise , I make only $30.000 a year . " Impervious to critical barbs , he says , in the familiar tones of the misunderstood : " I 'm not designing for architects ; I 'm designing for the people . ' '          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
