Like many of Shakespeare 's other comedies , the rickety plot of As You Like It involves a heroine who assumes masculine disguise . According to Polish Critic Jan Kott , much of the ribaldry , irony and ambiguity of this transvestite change is lost on modern audiences , who are accustomed to seeing females in female roles . In the 17th century the roles of women were invariably played by boys . <P> Inspired by Kott 's theories , London 's National Theater Company last week staged a version of As You Like It in which all four female parts were played by men . For the production the actor-actresses were garbed in wigs and flowing gowns but there were no falsies and no falsettos . The result was a remark ably chaste performance free of disturbing homoerotic overtones . While Lon don reviewers generally had mixed feelings about the experiment , they praised the angular grace of Ronald Pickup 's Rosalind , which evoked memories of the sprightly 1961 performance in the same role by Vanessa Redgrave . <P> In the part of Rosalind 's confidante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reciting his iambic rantings in a sonorous baritone . And the actor-actors , headed by Jeremy Brett as Orlando , supported their mates with straight-faced manliness . <P> Director Clifford Williams , who was initially dubious about using men in women 's roles , was delighted with the results . " Underlying the love scenes be tween Orlando and Rosalind there is an incandescent purity , " he says . " Men are somehow better at this than wom en . Actresses , even the best ones , are likely to gush a little . " Williams is mus ing over other possibilities : " It might be interesting to do Antony and Cleopa tra with a man as Cleopatra . There is n't a female around who can really play that role . "
