Last week 8,000 members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints gathered in Salt Lake City 's Mormon Tabernacle to commemorate the 137th anniversary of the founding of the largest and strongest made-in-America faith . As usual , church leaders presented impressive testimonials to the thriving success of Mormonism . Since 1940 , membership in the church has more than tripled , to 2,600,000 . Last year alone , the church gained 117,000 new members . Two-thirds of the new comers were converts netted by the 12,000Mormon missionaries who toil from New England to New Zealand . <P> Financially , the church is thriving too . The vast Mormon-owned business enterprises-ranging from Utah 's largest department store to a 360,000-acre Florida cattle ranch-help produce an income that some church observers estimate at $1,000,000 per day . The exact total is a closely guarded church secret . <P> Updating Doctrine . Outwardly secure and successful , the unique religion created by Joseph Smith and carried to Utah by Brigham Young is nonetheless at a testing time . Much as in the churches of mainstream Christianity , Mormonism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new generation of believers who temper loyalty to the faith with a conviction that its doctrines need updating . Worried about the relevance of Mormonism , some of them are all but openly critical of the policies fostered by the church 's venerable , conservative hierarchy , headed by President David O. McKay , 93 , and his Council of the Twelve Apostles . <P> Latter-Day Saints can now question some of the church 's peculiar disciplines without being stigmatized by their neighbors . Although the U.S. Surgeon General 's report on smoking confirmed the Mormon conviction that tobacco is an evil , there is widespread feeling that the church should relax its ban on cof fee and tea . " A lot of good Mormons drink coffee now , " says one Utah saint . " The church should not make its prohibition a commandment . " Still another quaint tradition is the Mormons ' use of " temple garments " -a torso-covering form of underclothing signifying their covenant with the Lord-which devout believers , both women and men , are expected to wear . <P> A more serious complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own organization , too little with the problems of the world . J. D. Williams , a professor of political science at the University of Utah and a former member of a stake ( diocese ) high council , argues : " It 's time that the church indicated its concern for more things than simply internal structure and processes . " He notes that the Salt Lake City League of Women Voters , in a city that is 52% Mormon , is almost exclusively staffed by " Gentiles " ( non-Mormons ) . Church members should devote more of their energies to politics and community service .
