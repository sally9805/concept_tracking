txt In an old , five-story factory a few blocks west of downtown Chicago , 500 workers busily hem shower curtains , wind coils for soldering irons , drill holes in heavy steel parts , package pea shooters , fasten buckles on dog collars and paint picture frames . Although the men and women performing these varied jobs receive no wages , the plant will operate at a deficit of more than $250,000 in ' 1061 , its manager says . " We 're having a highly successful year . " he adds . This paradoxical plant is n't designed to make money . It 's run by Cook County 's Public Welfare Department to train relief recipients . " We take people who have nothing to offer an employer and give them a simple skill that is saleable in today 's job market , " says A. N. Landa , who heads the county 's welfare rehabilitation services . W " lfare authorities around the country are turning increasingly to training programs similar to the one here in an effort to slow the climb in relief costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide nearly Si billion for retraining the unemployed over the next four years . In addition , welfare agencies are using a variety of other methods to check rising costs . These methods range from ferreting out fathers who have abandoned their families to the controversial plan of Newburgh , N.Y to reduce its welfare load by imposing a stringent new code which , among other things , would limit aid to many recipients to three months in any one year and would require able-bodied adult male recipients to do maintenance work for the city . Despite these efforts , public welfare costs keep climbing . Federal . state and local outlays for the blind , aged , disabled and others unable to provide for themselves reached a record $4 billion in the Government-fiscal year ended June 30 , up from $3.7 billion in the previous year and from le , , ss than $1 billion a decade and a half earlier . The high in the 1930'a was $3.2 billion in 1938 . The number of persons receiving relief topped 7.8 million at last count on February 2R , compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1945 . It requires a lot of effort to get even small results in the battle to trim the welfare load . The training program here in Chicago for instance , touches only a small segment of the relief rolls and , even among those who are taught new skills , many fail to last at the jobs for which they are trained . " Only about a third of those who complete our training program find jobs immediately and onethird of those who do are back on relief within a year , " concedes Cook County 's Mr. Landa . But some instances of training have been notably successful , Mr Landa says . He recalls the case of a ** Negro woman who had been di awing aid to dependent children checks for about four years to support her five children . She took a six-month course in the operation of a power sewing machine and now supports her family by working in a small dress factory her first job in eight years . Comments Mr. Lands : " We think a large enough number of welfare recipients get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Training Programs Other states and communities apparently agree ; similar programa have sprung up elsewhere . Los Angeles has a two-pronged training program embracing both classroom studies and on-the-Job training . Welfare authorities pay tuition and transportation costs and arrange child care for mothers of needy children who want to attend classes to improve their skills . These mothers enroll in adult education classes , short courses in business college or industrial training programs to brush up on typing , short- hand and other clerical skills or to learn to operate new office machines . according to Ellis P Murphy . assistant director of the Bur eau of Public Aid . Welfare recipients also get experience and simple training by working in hospitals and other public institutions . " Many of these people later take civil service tests and become full-time employes of the instatutions. ? ? Mr. Murphy says . " Last year we trained and found jobs for about 800 mothers of needy children , up from only a handful five years ago . " Colorado welfare officials use the public school system to train welfare recipients . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in occupations for which an aptitude test discloses they have some talent . Women learn to be beauticians , office workers , office machine operators , maids or wartresseq Some of the men are trained in the operation of drill presses and other factory machines . This year about 300 will be trained under the program , up from 200 last year . Most of last year 's trainees were placed in jobs , officials say . Help From Uncle Sam These state and local efforts will get a powerful assist from the Federal Government if Congress passes President Kennedy 's retraining bill . The proposal calls for retraining an estimated 800.000 jobless workers during the next four years . Labor Secretary ' Arthur J. Goldberg predicts the program would cost about $700 million . Included would be classes to impart new skills , subsistence payments for unemployed workers attending the sessions and relocation of the graduates to areas where their training will enable them to find jobs . A relatively small percentage of those trained would be from the welfare rolls , but the program is aimed at unskilled workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pressing for a three-year $275 million " pilot " program to provide training and temporary work for young men and women between 16 and 22 . The proposal includes a Youth Conservation Corps , in which young men would live in camps and work on outdoor conservation projects ; on-thejob and classroom training in new skills for young men and women ; and training on local public works projects and in public service institutions , such as schools and hopitals . The Federal Government would put the cost of training and at least part of the wages of on-the-job trainees . In addition to these proposals , Congress already has approved a limited $14.5 million retraining effort as part of the $394 million aid to depressed areas program . Welfare authorities are increasing efforts to find jobs for relief recipients who have some skills . Cook County operates a placement service along with its rehabilitation center . This month the service will find jobs for about 1.000 persons , double three years ago . New York City set up its own employment office six years ago , and now has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare code which went into effect in Newburgh Sunday undoubtedly represents the most drastic action yet taken by a community to cut relief costs . Joseph . Mitchell , city manager of Newburgh , ordered the changes in re of procedures in hopes of paring the city 's $83,085 annual welfare bill . In addition to requiring able-bodied men to work and to limiting payments to certain recipients to three months a year , the city 's new code also calls for : Denial of relief to anyone who quits his job voluntarily or who turns down a job , payment in many cases in vouchers good for rent , food and clothing instead of payment in cash ; a limitation of the allotment for any one family unit to no more than the take-home pay of the lowest-paid city employe with a family of comparable size ; termination of assistance to mothers drawing aid for children born out of wedlock if they should have additional illegitimate children ; and a tightening of aid regulations applying to newcomers to the city . The New York State Board of Social Welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 7 , has taken the position that some provisions of the new Newburgh code are in apparent conflict with ' state and Federal welfare statutes . The Board has called on the New York Attorney General to intervene and take the matter to court .
