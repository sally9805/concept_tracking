California 's politicians have long boasted that their state is on the move . Scientists agree . On opposite sides of a 600-mile line called the San Andreas fault , the coastal strip of California is slowly but inexorably moving to the northwest while the remainder of the state is shifting toward the southeast . <P> This strange mobility of terrain is of more than academic interest . It produces the earthquakes that suddenly and with out warning jolt areas of California , occasionally with catastrophic results . <P> Although scientists are powerless to prevent earthquakes , they have high hopes that they can some day forecast them with reasonable accuracy . That day may not be far off . By carefully measuring movements along the San Andreas and nearby smaller faults , Seismologist Renner Hofmann says , he has successfully predicted recent California earthquakes . To prove that he is not merely displaying scientific hindsight , Hofmann has issued a new U.S. quake-cast . Within the next 18 months , he predicts , earthquakes of at least moderate intensity will rock areas near Santa Cruz and south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by Hofmann developed the quakecast method hile investigating fault zones for the California Department of Water Resources , which is understandably co cerned about the effects of earth slip page and quakes on its vast system of pumping plants , dams and aqueducts . <P> To measure the earth movements in the fault zones , they established over 90 fixed observation points along the faults . <P> Using an instrument called the geodimeter , Hofmann aimed a beam of in tense light from a site on one side of a fault at a reflector set up on the other side , between twelve and 20 miles away . <P> By measuring the time required for the light to travel to the reflector and back to the geodimeter , he calculated the precise distance between the two points . <P> By repeating the measurement annually , he was able to determine with precision the amount and direction of movement that had taken place since the last measurement .

In some areas , however , friction between the sliding masses of rock caused the movement to slow and even to stop . " When the fault sticks , " Hofmann says , " the movement is transferred to smaller , adjacent faults that can stand only a limited amount of movement . When these smaller faults reach their limit , the forces increase until the main fault breaks loose again . This sudden breaking loose is the earthquake . " <P> By observing slowdowns - and even apparent reversals-in the fault movements at certain points , and by correlating them with subsequent earthquakes in the same areas , Hofmann gradually developed a rule-of-thumb system for quake prediction . His technique is far from foolproof ; although he has correctly forecast eight recent earthquakes of significant size , 17 other quakes that his method predicted have failed to materialize . But Hofmann believes that more frequent monitoring of an even larger system of observation points will make his technique more reliable . He is convinced that the future of earthquake forecasting lies in being diligent to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
