Danton 's Death , by Georg Buechner . Physically , the Vivian Beaumont Theater , the Lincoln Center Repertory 's new home , is resplendent ( see SHOW BUSINESS ) . Financially , this theater company is the richest in the U.S. Dramatically , it is bankrupt . Under its new directors , Herbert Blau and Jules Irving , Lincoln Center begins its third season by patting together another of a seemingly endless series of dramatic mudpies . <P> Georg Buechner was an angry young German of the early 19th century . He was 21 when he wrote this play , and only 23 when he died . If he were alive today , he would presumably burn his draft card and spare the drama . <P> Danton 's Death is Buechner 's stab at planting Hamlet in the middle of the French Revolution . Compared with Buechner 's hero , Shakespeare 's is a prince of action and a man of few words . Buechner 's straw man is a compulsive blabbertongue who would rather rant than fight . The play is a petrified forest of conflicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in revolutionary disillusionment , an attack on revolutionary fanaticism or a defense of revolutionary intransigence . Danton can be seen as victim or traitor , Robespierre as scourge or hero , or both as merely hapless puppets in the lock-step march of historical determinism . <P> Any one of these themes might have stung the play into fitful life if it were not smothered in rhetoric . Danton inhales moral smog and exhales bombast . Herbert Blau is credited with translating the German ; he has assuredly embalmed the English . Thanks to Blau , Robespierre has been given an outward resemblance to Barry Goldwater . This is a political subtlety fully worthy of the mentality that-in a since-deleted program note-linked Lyndon B. Johnson and Mao Tse-tung as fellow tyrants . Thanks to Blau , too , the direction resembles a wind machine blowing actors around like autumn leaves . <P> The cast could handle a senior-class play . Instead of drawing from the pool of New York 's unparalleled acting talent , Lincoln Center has chosen to import too many of the San Francisco minor-leaguers of Irving-cum-Blau . All this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowes .
