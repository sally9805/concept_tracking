Ever since the prime rate appeared in the ' 30s as a measure of what the bluest-chip corporations must pay for a bank loan , commercial banks have agreed about what that interest charge should be . Sometimes it has taken a few days ; once , in 1958 , it took a week for the pacemaking banks to fall in line with a lower rate . But for a fortnight some 40 of the nation 's biggest banks have , to their consternation , found themselves in an unexpected battle over " the prime " with Chase Manhattan , New York City 's biggest and the nation 's second largest bank . <P> Chase dropped a bomb on Jan. 26 by cutting its prime rate from 6% to 5% - the first such drop in six years . Though delighted , even Administration economists were surprised by the size of the slash . " Too much , too soon , " chorused other bankers , who next day began cutting their rates half as much , to 5% , in a half bow yet pointed rebuke to Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase with more business than it could handle . <P> Quiet Pressure . Through last week , no such stampede had arisen . Instead , some companies quietly began feeding deposits into Chase Manhattan , hoping thereby to pressure other banks to slice their prime rate to Chase 's 5% level . At a news conference , Chase Chairman George Champion casually noted that his bank had about $1 billion in cash and other quick assets to meet any surge in loan demand . By week 's end , Chase had withstood two weeks of the split-level struggle , and many businessmen were betting that the bank would emerge the victor , thus raising its prestige in a business where prestige counts for a lot . <P> " Everybody will be down to 5% , " predicted Vice President-Comptroller John W. D. Wright of International Harvester . " It 's only a question of time . " Said President Mark C. Wheeler of Boston 's New England Merchants National Bank : " My own belief is that Chase is going to make 5% stick . The demand for funds has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than expected . " <P> That is just how Chase Manhattan saw the trend . " Normally , there is a marked increase in bank loans in December , " says Executive Vice President George A. Roeder Jr. , " and a marked decrease in January . The December increase did not materialize . " Meeting that portentous January day , Chase Manhattan 's top officers also noted that interest rates had slipped as much as one percentage point from their 1966 peaks . High-grade corporate bond yields were down from 5.56% to 5% , municipal bonds from 4.26% to 3.50% and 91-day Treasury bills from 5.74% to 4.40%. the slide continued last week . Several banks and finance companies cut the interest charged auto dealers to carry car inventories from 6% to 6% . New York 's Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. reduced its rate on 90-day certificates of deposit from 5% to a flat 5% . <P> Expanding Credit . How the prime-rate battle ends depends more than anything else on the Federal Reserve Board . With the economy cooling off , the board allowed bank credit to expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates last week put the January expansion at about 15% . With that , Wall Street analysts figured that the board 's next move might even be a cut in bank-reserve requirements-which would spread an easing of credit across the nation .
