THE WAR AND THE HOKE FRONT To THE EDITOR : Re " The Great Society Is a Sick Society , " by J. W. Fulbright , Aug 20 : I am a student , just turned 19 years old , who has spent this past summer " wrestling with his conscience " because of his country 's involvement in the war in Vietnam . Reliable accounts of American actions in that unfortunate country have come close to making me scream out that I could support my Government 's policy no further . On the other hand , I can not support a policy of withdrawal that would abandon the Vietnamese people ? and perhaps ultimately all of Southeast Asia  --  to the new imperialism that now threatens the world . Those of my generation who oppose the United States involvement in Vietnam , in whom Senator Fulbright proclaims such fervent faith , seem to me to be // Letters CRITIC ? Senator Fulbright listens as Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // blind to the abhorrent nature of totalitarian collectivism . One man who was not blind to the realities of revolution and Communism was the French writer Albert Camus . In 1957 , he wrote of the Hungarian rebellion : " The defects of the West are innumerable , its crimes and errors very real . But in the end , let us not forget that we are the only ones to have the possibility of improvement and emancipation that lies in free genius . The truth is that there is room for everything among us , even ? for evil . . . There is room also for honor , for the freedom to desire , for the adventure of the mind . " Ten years after these words were written they express the reasons for which I oppose Communism , in Vietnam as elsewhere . It is our moral imperative to fight injustice both at home and abroad , and I believe that we have the resources to do both . PAUL BECIcERMAN . Cambridge , Mass . ? To THE EDITOR : Senator Fulbright 's eloquent and persuasive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are selfevident facts ; the third is the Senator 's assertion of a direct causal relation between these two : 1 . The United States is at war in Vietnam . 2 . The American soul is sick . 3 . The war is the cause of that sickness . The comforting corollary is obvious : end the war in Vietnam and the illness in the American soul will mend . Unfortunately for the Senator 's assurance and our comfort his argument is a patent and flagrant non sequitur . The maladies which afflict our nation 's psyche are far deeper , more malignant and , above all , older than our involvement in Vietnam . Every one of the major symptoms of sickness , both individual and corporate  --  juvenile delinquency , crime , alcoholism , narcoticism , sexual license , marital breakdown , neuroticism , youthful revolt , Negro protest , urban disturbance ? was far advanced and accelerating in a geometric curve prior to escalation in Vietnam , even before our earliest military commitment there . The pros and cons of disengagement from Vietnam must be argued on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American society to that involvement is to flay a convenient whipping-boy instead of facing up to the true and far more intractable sources of illness . To suggest that withdrawal from Vietnam would cure the maladies is to lull the American people into a specious expectation . No one who has traveled widely throughout Asia in the postwar years can blind himself to the facts of United States power everywhere . That power is due far less to the " military shield , " which today screens every non-Communist Asian nation from Korea through India , than to commercial penetration and obdurate political realities . By the same token , the real issue today is not military escalation or withdrawal from Vietnam ; it is continuance or disengagement of American involvement ? economic , political and military  --  with the whole of Asia . The logic of Senator Fulbright 's advocacy is over-all disengagement and reversion to a contemporary form of that " splendid isolation " ? the creation of an ideal domestic society as an " example " to the rest of the world at the price of withdrawal from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us thought had been exposed and decisively rejected a quarter of a century ago . HENRY P. VAN DUSEN , Former President , Union Theological Seminary . New York . ? To THE EDITOR : I wish I could take more comfort from the fact that in our society today , sick as it is , such a highly regarded newspaper still publishes articles such as Senator Fulbright 's . The facts just do n't go away , however . Many do indeed protest our national policies , but the President , the State Department and the military do not indicate that they hear . Without hesitation the policies continue in effect . In other words , our freedom to protest is matched by their freedom to " not listen " or heed and to believe sincerely that this is " democracy in action . " I think it is nothing of the sort , and it frightens me . Mrs. MAX COLPETZER . Newark , Del . ? To THE EDITOR : Fulbright for President . Eiuc P. GUMPERZ . Vineland , N. J. ? To THE EDITOR : Crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I hope I may be forgiven for offering a couple of footnotes to Senator Fuibright 's article . He writes : " America , which only a few years ago seemed to the world to be a model of democracy and social justice , has become a symbol of violence and undisciplined power . " If he were to rewrite the sentence to read , " seemed in the United States to be a model to the world . . . " no doubt he would be right , in moments of extreme national euphoria . But " democracy " and " social justice " are both abstractions with a million implications . America is respected , envied and attractive as a land of opportunity , abundance and ability to manipulate material things . No nation , even in northwestern Europe , could afford the full panoply of American political institutions , even if they respected them more than they do . Most Latin-American countries which framed constitutions on the United States model have abandoned them .

And just because the Indians were virtually wiped out , the French , Spanish and Russians bought out , and the British and Mexicans thrown out by populists and not by emperors does not make them peaceful episodes . The rule that " those to whom much is given , from them shall much be required " is hard to escape , and requires more than dreams , impossible promises , and the setting aside of a given proportion of the gross national product .

ETHNIC PRIDE To mg EDITOR : Mario Puzo 's article " The Italians , American Style , " Aug. 6 , on the American Italian Anti - Defamation League , Inc. , mentions the Irish twice . He says that his mother believes Al Capone was an Irishman masquerading as an Italian to give the Italians a bad name . He also says that it 's true the IrishAmericans drink more than any other group , and that one study shows that 44 per cent of Bowery drunks are Irish Americans . I 'll say one thing for Mr. Puzo  --  he sure knows how to hurt a guy . Perhaps what we need is swift formation of an Irish American Anti-Defamation League with two basic tenets : ( 1 ) Any Irishman who pretends to be an Italian gangster automatically forfeits his right to march in the St. Patrick 's Day parade . ( 2 ) Liquor companies // // whose ads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . And what liquor company could survive that blow ? MARTIN DUFFY . Garden City , N. Y. ? To THE Exam : Mario Puzo writes with an animus which wholly destroys his supposed exposition as a piece of objective analysis . He says that " Italian immigrants of the eighteen hundreds , asked by an American newspaperman if they still did not love their homeland , answered , ' Italy is for us who gives us to eat . " What was this newspaperman who lived 100 years and interviewed all the Italians who came to America in the 19th century ? Mr. Puzo 's statement is ludicrous for another reason . Anyone who knew the Italians who landed here in 1800 knows that they never lost a love and reverence for the land of their birth . Nor is it true that their allegiance to America was based only on the fact that here they got something to eat . They loved America because they helped to build modern America and became part of it . I believe I am as much an expert on Italians and ItalianAmericans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian parents . I graduated from four American universities and the University of Rome . I wrote a book entitled " The Story of the Italians in America . " With that expertise I declare untrue , as well as shamefully defamatory , Mr. Puzo 's recklessly wild statement that Italians and ItalianAmericans " control organized crime in America . " Nor is there the slightest evidence that " most of the operators in organized crime in this country will bleed Italian blood . " And he slanders Frank Sinatra when he says this popular and successful ItalianAmerican " emulates Mafia chiefs . " Considering the whole tenor of Mr. Puzo 's Jeremiad , I am surprised that he did not say he believed the Vinland Map ! MICHAEL ANGELO MUSMANNO , Justice , Supreme Court of Pennsylvania .

However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel " there seems to be nothing we can do .

In the following days and months the White House announces that more men will be sent to Vietnam , more bombing raids made , more money spent . At the same time it is announced that the model cities , teachers corps and antipollution programs will be cut back .

And they are overridden by their conservative and reactionary and timid colleagues in Congress .

And , as if in a paranoid pique , Washington intensifies the war with every protest against it . I can , in 1968 , vote against Johnson if he does not respond to the proposals of A. Philip Randolph , Martin Luther King , Charles Percy , and others . For whom ? Nixon ? Romney ? Reagan ? It is to laugh/cry .

To THE EDITOR : Mr. Rustin 's article starts out as nothing less than a masterpiece of dispassionate and scholarly analysis of the Negro ghetto and Negro riots . He proves that the recent riots are neither a rebellion nor a social revolution . He even pinpoints for us who the rioter is  --  the unemployed teen-ager who wants to be part " of the white collar organization man 's world " but can not ( presumably because of white oppression and segregation ) . But toward the end he becomes disappointingly fuzzy . Does he mean that we promised his anti-hem alligator shoes and alpaca sweaters , then reneged on the promise ? Is it " mystification leading to inaction " to ask whether the 38 per cent Negro jobless rate vs. the 10 per cent white rate is , pure and simple , a measure of oppression and discrimination or due to other causes ? His " no proof that Negroes do not want to work " is no proof to me , because several times I advertised for a worker , received many seemingly interested inquiries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . III ARAB JERUSALEM To THE EDITOR : I read " Jerusalem : Experiment in Co-existence " by Sanche de Gramont , July 30 , with the greatest interest and concern . If one had never been in Jerusalem , Jordan , walking the narrow cobblestone streets , learning to know the people , this article would unquestionably leave the reader thinking that nothing had been accomplished by the Arabs , that they had nothing to offer to the new " co-existence experiment " except Arab social diseases ( an unforgiveable sentence in the article ) . What about Miss Halaby 's " Fellaha " Cottage Industry , where refugee girls learn the excellent handicrafts which bring them not only economic security but wholesome happy living ? Or the great Agricultural School in Jericho which Musa Alami had built up to high quality , even by Western standards ? ( I understand that the entire school , with its fine buildings and houses , was entirely demolished this June by the Israeli . ) Or the " House of Flowers " ? an Arab kindergarten run by Elizabeth Nasser in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Nor was any mention made of the wonderful Children 's Hospital just inside the Herod Gate  --  the work of the great Vestor family , one-time citizens of Chicago , Ill.  --  a hospital free to any mother or child who needs care , surgery or clinical training , or of all that the Friends of the Middle East , the Y.W.C.A. and Y.M.C.A. are doing to enrich day-to-day living in Jerusalem , Jordan . MARGARET ALLEN . Craftsbury Common , Vt . ? The author replies : " My remark that the Israelis seem to think they are exchanging their social benefits for Arab social diseases was intended as ironic . It was a reflection of the Israeli ' bulldozer mentality ' ? of wanting to impose Western standards on the Jerusalem Arabs with perhaps too little concern for Arab tradition . " The ' accomplishments ' cited for Arab Jerusalem , such as the House of Flowers and the Cottage Industry , are all private efforts , which help point up the inadequacy of Government health , education , and welfare programs . One reason the Friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so much for Jerusalem is that the Jordanian Government did so little . " I saw Frieda Ward , Mrs. Vestor 's daughter , who now runs the Children 's Hospital inside Herod 's Gate , on the morning of June 8 . She told me the hospital had been badly damaged in the fighting , but that all of its eight patients had been evacuated in time . "
