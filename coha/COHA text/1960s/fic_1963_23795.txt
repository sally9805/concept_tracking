HIS FRIEND VANKA A N D how do we feel today ? " Dr. Bosell asked . Jan lilted his eyes and looked at Dr. Bosell 's wrinkled red face with its clipped gray mustache that made him resemble a huge , good-natured cat . His protruding stomach , on which the white coat would n't close , showed a gold watch chain dangling from a vest pocket . Jan resented the patronizing " we . " He mumbled : ' ' The leg bothered rue at night . " " Leg , what leg ? " Dr. Bosell started to say , lifting his eyebrows , but he quickly added , " Oh , ya , the leg of course . " He had remembered that Jan always referred to the short clumsy stump which only recently had emerged from the cocoon of white bandages as " the leg . " He was a strange boy , Jan . A farmer picked him up on the road only a few days before the war was over and the Russians marched into this part of Germany , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was wearing a striped uniform of a camp or prison inmate . It was so filthy and full of lice that they had to dispose of it right away . It was hard to say how old he was . He could be any age . His body emaciated , his hair cropped short : and his face , the color of the earth , with sunken eyes , was that of an old man . Only days later did Dr. Bose realize that he was a boy of nineteen or perhaps twenty . He gave his name as Jan something or other , a typical Polish namewith a lot of " sz " and " cz " in it , though he was obviously Jewish . Not that Dr. Bosell really minded ; he was never active in politics , and certainly he was not going to start then when the war was over and lost . The real shock came when one day Jan addressed him in a flawless , educated German and , apparently amused by Dr. Bosell 's surprise , quickly added an appropriate Latin quotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if it were the most natural thing for somebody willmut an address , with a name no God-fearing person could even pronounce , to quote Descartes in the original . Dr. Bose ! ! described Jan with one untranslatable word : " Unheimlich . " " I am telling you Martha , " he would say to his wife , " this boy is unheimlich , simply unheimlich . " And now after three months he still could n't figure him out . So lie only cleared his throat carefully avoiding Jan 's eyes , gave instructions to Schwester Lotte , then moved to the next bed where Vanka , the Russian soldier , was lying . With Vanka matters were much simpler . He fractured his aria while driving drunk , spoke Russian only , and did not hide his hatred for Dr. Bosell 's being a German . In turn Dr. Boscll did not have to feel guilty for not liking him . Dr. Bose looked at Vanka 's chart , shook his head 65 approvingly , and rolled out of the room , Schwester Lotte tagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flashed a bright smile at Jan , and reminded hint that this was the day of his first walk outdoors . Jan lay there awhile , looking aimlessly at the ceiling before reaching for the suit folded neatly on the chair next to his bed . He ran his fingers over it , and the tweed felt pleasantly rough under his touch . He tried to remember the last time he wore a suit , and thought how nice it was of Schwester Lotte to give him one . She was a good girl , Schwester Lone . She would come in the morning , pull up the shades , and say : " It 's a lovely day , is n't it ! " Or : " We have rain finally . The farmers certainly can use some . " She was always in good spirits , Schwester Lotte , and when she smiled her eyes smiled first , lighting up her whole face , and only then her lips parted showing a row of even white teeth . She would take a piece of cotton , put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip , stick out her stomach and say , imitating Dr. Bosell 's deep voice : " And how do we feel today ? " waiting for Jan to respond with a smile . Or she would tell stories like the one she told yesterday . " Do you know , " she said , shaking his pillow , " they finally caught him . " " Caught whom ? " Jan asked . " The thief of course , the one who broke into the bakery . They chased and chased after him , and could n't catch him . Finally they did , in the next village , and guess what ... " " What ? " Jan asked with feigned interest , because he knew very well what was coming . " He had a wooden leg , " Schwester Lotte concluded triumphantly . " No kidding , " Jan said , even though he knew Schwester Lone had invented the thief , the burglary , and the manhunt . But he did n't mind at all because it was good to hear even if it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it all up . j A N started putting on the suit , uncomfortably conscious of Vanka 's watchful eyes . He knew Vanka was sore ; he always was when Jan talked to Dr. Bosch ' or Schwester Lotte. lie considered it some kind of treason , a conspiracy aimed at him . Today Vanka seemed even more upset . because not only did Jan converse with Schwester Lotte but he also accepted the old suit from her . The jacket was big and hung on him as on a hanger . He had to tighten the pants at the waist with a safety pin . Propping himself on the crutches he looked at his reflection in the window-pane . He had almost forgotten how tall he was , tall and very lean . His brown hair fell unruly down his forehead . His face was pale , bony , and elongated , his features small and fine , and his dark eyes seemed enormously big in their sockets . The empty trouser leg hung limply and Jan thought of pinning it up the way he had seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea as soon as it occurred to him , for he came to the conclusion that this way it hardly showed at all , wondering why they did it . in the first place . He started toward the door waving good-by to Vanka who was watching his exit . " Do n't forget to give my love to all the Germans out there , " he shouted after him sullenly . The hospital corridor , familiar by now , was smooth and friendly and did n't present any difficulties . It was only after he pushed the heavy door and found himself in the street that he felt scared . The street that had looked so nice and easy from the hospital window suddenly turned into an enemy , steep and uneven , hill of obstacles , hostile . The crutches felt heavy after a few minutes and pressed painfully under his armpits . He had to stop to catch his breath and wipe the sweat off his face with his sleeve . There was a small park two blocks away , and Jan headed toward it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew longer and longer . When he finally got there he was extremely tired . But , it was a good kind of tiredness , with accomplishment in it , the kind one feels after conquering a mountain and looking for the first time from its peak into the valley . He put his crutches clown , and carefully stretched himself on the grass . fIe folded his hands under his head and looked up . There was nothing but the sky above him , bright and blue with light feathery clouds flowing like a river . He watched them chasing each other and waited for two small ones to merge and form a big one . He closed his eyes and felt the sun , still warm for October , caressing his eyelids . The warmth penetrated him and made him a little drowsy , kind of light and weightless . He felt a little the wav he had after morphine , good , magnanimous , forgiving , and loving everything and everybodyVanka , Schwester Lotte , and even old Dr. Bose11 . Heflin Karmel-Wolfe began writing as a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her poems came out in this country . She has been busy since , bringing up her two children in New York . Her first published story was chosen for " The Best American Short Stories 1962 . " This is her second . 66 HIS FRIEND VANKA He took a deep breath and all of a sudden felt very happy . It was almost like the " Freedom " he had dreamed of all through those years . lust lying on the grass all alone with nobody watching him , the sun on his face , a breeze in his hair , and the air smelling of autumn and wet leaves . The smell suddenly brought back memories of the park in Krakow , of falling chestnuts , not quite open , with green prickly shells , and of Halinka . I I E COULD think about her now without the sharp pang of pain , without trying to chase her out of his thoughts , And he did n't have The Dream " anymore . " The Dream " he called it , not " a dream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way it happened . He was locked up with the others in the men 's camp because the women 's barracks were being searched for jewelry . He could hear shouts and screams and shots all coming to him muffled by the screen of distance . He was standing at the window and looking at the ramp . There was a woman tying right in front of Halinka 's barracks . He stared at her intently but she was all blurry and he had to squint his eyes to see her better . And the more he looked the more she seemed like Halinka . He said to himself : " Oh no , it ca n't he Halinka , of course it is n't IIalinka . " And then hesaid : " Good God , please make her not be Halinka . " And then he spelled her name in his mind H-a-I-i-n-k-a W-e-i-n-r-c-b , and said to himself : " If the number of letters is even , it wo n't he Halinka . " He counted them and it was even , and he felt stupid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curfew was over , he rushed to the door pushing everybody aside , and flung it wide open . He ran and he ran , until he stopped because there she was . She was lying with her face down and she did n't look sixteen at all ; she was so small and frail , like a little girl . He knelt next to her , turned her over , and it was n't hard at all for she was so light . She looked at him . Yes , she looked at hint , for her eyes were wide open and there was no fear in them , only some kind of surprise . She looked exactly as she did yesterday when he said good-by to her . Everything was there , her eyes , her hands , her legs . Only she was dead . He stared at her without understanding it at all when suddenly he remembered something he should do . Something he read in a book or maybe saw in the movies : The eyes of the dead should be closed . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't look surprised anymore . Then he knew there was something else he should do . He should cry for Halinka because she was his girl , because he liked her an awful lot , and because she was dead . That was also something he knew he should do , like the closing of the eyes , something he read about or maybe saw in the movies . And he tried but his mouth felt dry . and so did his eyes , and the tears would not come . So he just pulled clown her skirt to cover her knees and got up and left . Ever since , he had " The Dream " over and over again , and he would wake up , his face covered with sweat , sweat forming a little pool on his neck , feeling very tired as if she were extremely heavy , as if turning her over were just too much for him . Only recently he had " The Dream " again . He was running toward Halinka . He knelt , he turned her over , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a matter of fact she was n't Halinka at all , only Schwester Lotte , and she sat up , bared her white teeth in a smile and said , " Hi . " And when he woke up he did n't feel tired at all , only a little guilty and ashamed as if lie had betrayed Halinka , and a little sad as if it were only then that he said good-by to her . He wondered what Vanka would say about this dream . He hated the Germans , Vanka . He really hated all of them . The very first day they brought him to the hospital , Vanka told him what they used to do to the Germans , how they burned down the villages until nothing was left but a sign : This is for Kiev , " or : " This is for Rostov . " Vanka told all this smoothly , without groping for words , and it was obvious he had told it many times before to anyone willing to listen . And Jan listened to him eagerly and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , the matter of crime and retaliation , guilt and revenge . He thought a lot about it and , the more he thought , the more involved and confused it became . Evenings Vanka 's friends would come . Sasha who played the harmonica , Grisha , and the girls Olga and Shura from the Russian major 's kitchen . Sasha would play and they would sing . Jan loved to listen to their singing . The melodies were sad , full of nostalgia , and very beautiful , and they did n't quite go with the words about the red banner being redder than blood , and about Russia that was always referred to as " Mother . " Vanka would join them in singing and his eyes would get misty , and he was n't the hero anymore , the one who burned down villages " For Kiev , ' ' but a boy not older than Jan , who was sad and very homesick . The girls would bring food from the major 's kitchen , neatly wrapped in a white kerchief tied in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vanka would untie it clinitsi/y with one hand , holding the end of the kerchief in his teeth , and cursing his bad fortune half seriously , half jokingly . The first time he opened the kerchief and spreatl it on his bed like a tablecloth , Jan gasped and stared transfixed like a child of the slums ; AID for the first time finds himself on the threshold of a mansion . For Vanka displayed unbelieNahl. ? . treasures : a big loaf of very white bread , a heart-shaped farmer cheese with drops of moisture forming on it , a Few eggs , and a tong sausage . He felt saliva gathering in his mouth and he swallowed it , thinking how hungry he was , how still very hungry though the war had been over for almost three months . Vanka must have felt his gaze or he turned around , looked at him and said : " Hey , Jan , you hungry ? " And without waiting for an answer , he cut a piece of sausage and threw it on Jan 's bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit into it . He closed his eyes , turned it with his tongue , caressed its taste , and held it in his mouth without swallowing to make it last longer . And ever since it had become some kind of daily procedure . The girls would bring the food . Vanka would unwrap it , giving each motion the importance of a religious ritual , and after asking Jan if he was hungry he would share his food with him . Jan would accept it silently , slowly building up a resentment of a have-not toward the one who has . And pretty soon he started displaying his own riches . He asked Schwcster Lotte for hooks and kept them right on the top of his night table . He was always very busy reading when Vanka had company and he conversed with Dr. Bose11 politely in his best German . Just to spite Vanka . Now thinking back he realized how unfair he had been and felt that they could become real friends , Vanka and he , that he could teach Vanka some things he knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay and laugh , how to get sad and sentimental over a song , and maybe even how to be real angry and curse . He decided In have a talk with Vanka and the decision made him very excited . H E GOT up slowly , laboriously and started toward the hospital . The street now seemed easier , the cobblestones did n't bother him too much . Maybe because lie was not paying attention to them , thinking about what he was going to say to Vanka and how he was going to say it . He rehearsed it over and over , trying to find the proper words , patching up his broken Russian with Polish expressions and hoping Vanka would understand . He entered the hospital , moved a little faster through the corridors , and stopped in front of their room . There were voices coming from it . It must have been some kind of Russian holiday because nobody ever visited Vanka during the day . Jan felt disappointed . He wanted so much to talk to Vanka alone . He opened the door carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls were there . There was food spread on Vanka 's bed , and a big almost empty horde of vodka on the bedside table . Sasha was telling something obviously very funny because they were laughing loudly and nobody paid any attention to his entry . There were chairs all over the tiny room and Jan had to squeeze through . In doing this he stumbled and pushed Shunt with his crutch . " Ouch , " Shura cried out . They all stared at him now . Vanka propped himself on his good elbow and looked at Jan wildly . " You , " he yelled , " you better watch out , you , you bastard ? " His eyes were dark with anger , he was drunk . " Vanya , " Shura said soothingly trying to calm him down . " let him be , do n't you see he is sick . " " Sick , " Vanka mimicked her in a shrill , high-pitched voice , " he is healthier than you and me , he is strong like a horse . A cripple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just stood there unable to move as if glued to the floor . " He is right , ? he thought with sudden realization . " My God , he is right . " He felt a throbbing and a swelling in his throat as if the tears he had n't cried all through those years were gathered there and were rushing into his eyes . Ile opened them wide , very wide , trying to imprison the tears and not let them escape . He looked down at his crutches , at the empty trouser leg . It was soiled and covered with mud , " So it would n't get dirty , " he thought , ' ' they pinned it up , so it would n't get dirty . " The sudden answer to the question that bothered him earlier in the morning brought an unexpected relief . He straightened himself on the crutches , swallowed , ran his tongue over his lips , and said " Excuse me . " But it did n't at all sound the way he wanted it to . Suddenly they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even they knew it . They knew it was n't the usual " excuse me . " Jan was n't merely asking them to let him pass , he seemed to ask forgiveness for the crutches , for the empty trouser leg , for his being there at all . They rose silently , pushed the chairs , and let him through . H E WENT to his bed , lay down , and closed his eyes . He let the tears run freely and they felt warm on his cheeks , tasted salty in his mouth , flowed down his neck , and made his shirt collar wet . He seemed to be dissolving in them and he did n't mind , he did n't mind it all . When he finally opened his eyes , he realized the others had left and there was only Vanka standing next to his bed , bending over him . Vanka 's small brown eyes suddenly reminded him of the little dachshund he used to have when he was a boy , when he caught him misbehaving on the living-room carpet . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanka 's hand . lie stood there staring at Jan trying to say something and finally stammered clumsily : " Jan , you hungry , cat Jan , eat . " Jan looked at him , at his pleading eyes , at the sausage swinging to and fro like a pendulum of am old-fashioned clock , managed a faint smile , stretched out his hand , took the sausage , and whispered : " Thanks .
