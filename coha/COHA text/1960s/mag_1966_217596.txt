If the early Romans lived for bread and circuses , the contemporary ones make circuses to earn their bread . Now adays , they call them costume pageants , and the tourists gobble them up , even though the shows are more hokey than historical . When the tourist season in Italy quieted down this year , it seemed to Impresario Gino Land ! that it would be a shame to waste all those horses , women and gladiators ; so he packed them all up and sent them to the U.S. for a multicity tour . Last week Landi 's Festa Italiana opened at Madison Square Garden , and much to everybody 's surprise , the extravaganza turned out to be a kind of 1st century Hellzapoppin . <P> The spectacle combines the glitter and grace of an ice show , the hell-for-leather horsemanship of a rodeo , the martial pageantry of a Veterans Day parade , and the breath-stopping violence of the St. Valentine 's Day massacre . The men are ruggedly masculine , and the girls are worth bringing binoculars for . <P> The action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carosello of the Roses , " for example , is a dazzling sword fight between six horsemen who try to slash short-stemmed roses from each other 's helmets . The " Coliseum " num ber is even more savage . It opens with a gladiator whipping a half-clad " Roman slave , " winds up with two four-horse chariots racing madly around the ring to see who can get to the victim first . The winner has the honor of tying the slave behind his chariot and dragging him across the arena and through the exit at full gallop . The violence of it all would certainly get a thumbs down from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to People , but on the other hand , Festa Italiana is the only show in town that keeps the performers in stitches .
