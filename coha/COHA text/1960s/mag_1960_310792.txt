Something without a name , but resembling an Atlantic economic community , was born in Paris last week . It reflected an American desire and a European worry . The U.S. feels that Western Europe , lifted to unprecedented prosperity by 14 years of American aid , should join the U.S. in underwriting the development of the poor countries of Asia , Africa and Latin America . Europe 's concern is that the growing commercial rivalry between the Common Market Six and the British-inspired Outer Seven would lead to a trade war that might jeopardize the Western alliance . <P> Last week , in the chill marble halls of Paris ' Hotel Majestic , a briefcase brigade of economic experts from 13 Western nations addressed themselves to these problems . At the suggestion of U.S. Under Secretary of State Douglas Dillon , they agreed to set up a temporary committee to think about increasing and coordinating foreign aid programs . For the long range , they decided " in principle " to establish a 20-nation Atlantic economic community consisting of the 18 members of the OEEC ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall Plan days ) , plus the U.S. and Canada . The details would be worked out by four " wise men " : one North American ( U.S. Ambassador to NATO W. Randolph Burgess ) ; one Frenchman , to represent the Common Market Six ( Bernard Clappier of the Finance Ministry ) ; one Briton , to represent the Outer Seven ( probably Foreign Office Economic Expert Sir Paul Gore-Booth ) ; and one Greek , to represent other Europeans ( Xenophon Zolotas , governor of the Bank of Greece ) . <P> Until the wise men could ruminate and conclude , most European leaders contained their optimism . But the proposed new community would have one overriding merit : through it , the U.S. would for the first time be linked to Europe by economic ties as formal and binding as the military ties of NATO .
