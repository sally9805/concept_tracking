 |p502  ONE CLEAR , CRISP morning in northern Michigan , I stood with a group of men , women , and children lining up for one of the Nation 's most curious competitions . Dressed for hiking and each holding a paper shopping bag , they awaited the starter 's gun for Boyne City 's annual mushroom hunt . Bang ! And 73 contestants raced into the tall timber like a scattering of hungry chickens . They were off on a search for morels. gray-to-brown fungi which for a few brief weeks each spring push up through the forest duff of this north country . Not stately or showy like many mushrooms of summer and fall , these crinkly-capped little sprouts nestle halfhidden in the drab litter of last season 's fallen leaves ( page 504 ) . But it was n't just promise of prizes that motivated the searchers . From winner to lastplace finisher , each would dine that night on what he gathered .

My visit to Boyne City 's May morel the un i hunt was but a facet of my study . When Mrs. Don Pearsall , a Michigan housewife , emerged as the contest winner , I asked her how she was able to find 286 morels in the allotted two hours while many another contestant could bring in only a dozen or so . " Just knowing where to look , " was her disarming reply . Whatever the telltale signs a stretch of burned-over woodland , perhaps  |p504  Forest-dwelling morel ( left ) makes a tasty morsel-when definitely identified . But this , like other edible wild mushrooms , has dangerous lookalikes ( text , opposite page ) . Basketful of color shows the endless variety of woodland fungi .

The hunt over , I strolled through the wo  |p505  to locate a few specimens for my own private test of morel flavor . I managed to find about two dozen , enough for an adequate meal . It was dusk when I reached my kitchenetteequipped motel quarters near Boyne City . I washed my basket of brownish tidbits and cut one mushroom in two lengthwise . The stem was hollow , and its gill-less cap was characteristically pitted and furrowed ( opposite ) . When in Doubt , Do n't !

I recall a recent walk through some New Jersey woods . There had been rain , and the trail was muddy . In a thicket of pine and birch I came upon a score of wondrously colored mushrooms , some nearly the diameter of a soccer ball . Their wide-spread umbrellas showed splashes of orange , yellow , and rose , and were flecked with bits of scale .

But with such Amanita species as bisporigera , pantherina , cothurnata , and spreta , a few bites may be fatal ; even the spores are loaded with poison ( see Nos. 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 on page 507 ) . With mixed feelings I stood amid these  |p510  baneful beauties , for I knew that even harmful mushrooms may play a useful role . Underground filaments of certain fungi entwine and invade the roots of particular trees and other plants to their mutual advantage . Collectors have noted that Boletus luteus prefers to grow near pines , Boletus scaber near birch , Boletinus cavipes under larch , and Amanita muscaria under pine and also aspen , birch , larch , and spruce . Benefits Flow in Two Directions With their filaments , the fungi have a superior capacity for absorbing nutrients ; these essentials they carry to the tree . The tree , in turn , manufactures carbohydrates through photosynthesis and transports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nourishment .

Unable to manufacture its own food by photosynthesis , it depends for sustenance on a fungus which acts as pipeline between it and adjacent trees . Orchids long resisted efforts to grow the . from seed until a French botanist put them a culture of fungal filaments regularly fou with the roots of the mature plant . In spite of much knowledge gained in cent years , many details of these relationshi. are still unclear to botanists . That same New Jersey countryside reveal - another curiosity of fungus life .

In an abandoned limestone mine , more than ten million pounds of top-grade  |p514  white mushrooms are produced each year . The calendar said January 5 , and snow lay deep on the ground ; yet within the mine the temperature held unvaryingly at 56 ? F. Outside , block-long mounds of stable litter , clover hay , and crushed corncobs lay steaming in the cold morning air . Machines turned and blended these materials into compost for filling shallow wooden trays . After four days in a pasteurizing chamber to kill disease-producing organisms , the trays would be " inoculated " with laboratory-grown mushroom filaments called " spawn .

In the farm 's spick-and-span laboratory , I talked to its consulting mycologist , Dr. James W. Sinden . Could mushrooms be grown on a small scale by a person at home ? " Certainly , " he said . " There are scores of small mushroom-growing units throughout the country . In France it has long been a cottage industry . However , we regard cultivation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , are highly susceptible to a number of ruinous diseases . Raising them also calls for careful attention to temperature , humidity , and soil condition . The fungus group of which mushrooms are a part has four major divisions . One , Basidiomycetes , has over 13,000 species , including the commercial mushroom , puffballs , destroying angels , smuts , and rusts . Another , Ascomycetes , embraces morels , powdery  |p519  ' ldews , blue and green molds , yeasts , truf , and most lichens in its 19,000 species . ycomycetes includes bread molds and wny mildews , among others , and Myxomytes the slime molds . All members of this vast plant division have several characteristics in common : They grain no chlorophyll ; they produce spores tead of seeds as one means of propagation ; i they have no flowers or true roots . Without chlorophyll , they can not convert sun 's energy into food , so they live as ? asites or scavengers .

Fuzz on that piece of stale ad or aging meat connects with subsur : , e fibers that break down the stuff on which . : arows . This also applies to mold species that may ect the human body , or to rusts , mildews , smuts , and dry rots . All are insidious invaders and destroyers of plants , animal tissues , stored train , timber , leather , fibers , fabrics ? even the coating on optical lenses and the insula7:on of electrical wires . Enzymes secreted by fungi can eat away almost any substance in the organic world . Yet , even though some are death-dealing parasites , other fungi confer an incalculable blessing . Acting as scavengers , they cause decay of stumps , logs , and vegetation . Without them , what a heap of debris would choke our forests and fields !

Fungi may be nature 's most notorious destroyers , yet they are at the same time among her most valued converters , enrichers , and synthesizers . Fungi are everywhere , thanks to an ability to produce endless numbers of spores ? minute , exceedingly tough bits of dormant life .

From a single meadow mushroom , : r a billion spores , each capable of starting new generation , may enter the air in a day . Nearly weightless , spores are swept into the atmosphere by air currents . They may travel on wings of the wind for hundreds and even thousands of miles before settling to . girth or being driven down by rain . Some - Ave been detected floating seven miles high . Spores Survive Decades of Adversity Not all spores ride the wind . Those of the  - -  ufie and stinkhorn groups depend on animals and insects for dispersal , clinging to fur or antennae hairs , or being broadcast in droppings . Spores of other species are scattered by rain splash . Some are fired from their spore case like pellets from a gun ? popping out when coverings shrink and split , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case through osmotic pressure . Spores may be star-shaped , oval , spherical , cubic , or rhombic . They range from black through brown , purple , ocher , rose , and white . Most are but a few ten thousandths of an inch across . Many species possess an impervious hide resistant to drying and freezing ? just about any environment short of fire and boiling water ? enabling them to sit out adversity for decades if necessary . When a spore of most types of fungus settles in a spot favorable for growth , it soaks up water and expands until its shell cracks . Soon an extension of the spore 's swelling protoplasm emerges as a tiny , translucent finger . Almost immediately it begins to branch . Then , in one of nature 's most primitive forms of reproduction , a branching filament pushes against another , or against one originating from a different spore . Their walls rupture , permitting a mixture of their protoplasms . Now proliferation begins in earnest . Hungry filaments stab in all directions in search of nutrient .

In some species these grow to bird-shot-size , then to pea-size and larger . Mushrooms sometimes pop up overnight at seemingly miraculous rates of growth . The truth is that they were pre-formed , waiting underground for the vital stimulus of rain . When it came , they drank deeply , within hours swelling ten- , twenty- , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet daylight . In some species , however , development takes days and even months . Most common mushrooms belong to the Basidiomycetes group . They exhibit a bewildering diversity of size , color , form , and hab- itat . In the instructive company of Prof. L. R. Hester , University of Tennessee mycologist , I encountered members of the group 's major divisions on a walk through the wet forests of Great Smoky Mountains National Park . Mushrooms That Turn Into Ink A cluster of small clay-hued beauties at the base of a stump had the gills that characterize one Basidiomycetes group . These were inky caps ? genus Coprinus ? so dubbed because at maturity the gills turn black and then . curiously , dissolve into inky fluid . Clinging to the side of a rotting log was a  |p523  ge mass of purest white , a Hericium , whose thy-looking surface marked it as a typical ample of another Basidiomycetes category ages 508-9 ) . A sprout with a sticky tip on - hick flies seemed to be feasting was a Phals ? stinkhorn member of a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umbrellas were Boletus , one f a Basidiomycetes group distinguished by res . Also porous were the bracket fungi that clung to trunks and stumps along our path , some so small as to seem like mere fuzz , others enormous tiered platters . On the forest floor 1 saw clusters of soft pearl-gray orbs with holes like chimney vents . When we brushed them with hand or foot , spore clouds spurted from the vents . Nearby were pea-size baskets , each with a clutch of spore cases ? bird's-nest fungi ( pages 526-7 ) . Both were members of Basidiomycetes ' puffball group . I saw , too , frequent evidence of mushrooms having been nibbled on . Squirrels relish mushrooms ; so do insects , chipmunks , turtles , and even deer and cattle . I 've often watched slugs feeding on tender puffballs or snails rasping at a gorgeous Boletus . Certain beetles and ants even go in for fungus farming . In the Amazon area several years ago , I followed endless lines of Atta ants 524 National Geograp  |p524  traveling the jungle floor . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lines led to underground galleries . There ants placed the leaves in compost beds that the queen had inoculated with a fungus , and the result was a fungus garden . From swellings on the mycelia the ants derive much of their sustenance . Barnyard Fungi Lasso Their Prey Quite the reverse are fungi that prey on nematode worms . These fungi live in soil , stable litter , and humus ? habitats shared by a variety of tiny nematodes . Mycelia of such fungi are armed with minute nooses . When a worm pokes in its head or tail , the noose tightens in a relentless stranglehold . The worm can not escape . The fungus then attacks and digests its victim . Sometimes in my field trips I came upon a small , rather undistinguished mushroom , Psilocybe , in wet , grassy places . Indians of Mexico 's Oaxaca State eat certain semipoisonous species of this mushroom for their vision-producing effects . One person who took part in such rites described hallucinations brought on by the mushroom as flashing scenes " of newness , of fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into hibiscus petals , and the petals dissolved into a Niagara Falls of flowing diamonds . " Vikings reportedly ate intoxicating toadstools . Tribal folk of the Russian region of Kamchatka believed that eating Amanita muscaria pulled back a veil to reveal the spirit within the mushroom . But all vision-producing mushrooms are potentially poisonous . Primitive people well knew of the dangerously narrow margin between a fantasy-inducing and a lethal dose . Many vitally important fungi belong to the category Ascomycetes , including the powdery mildews , some of earth 's most notorious crop ravagers . These fungi account for an appalling list of scourges : chestnut blight , apple scab , peach leaf curl , alfalfa leaf spot , corn ear rot , brown rot of stone fruit , lettuce drop , clover stem rot , grain rot , and many more . On the brighter side , the mold that produces penicillin belongs to the Ascomycetes group . So do yeasts , cheese molds , truffles , morels , cup fungi , and the fungus component of most lichens . Of these , the lichens are perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality a union of an alga and a fungus living in interwoven intimacy for mutual benefit . The fungus gains from the alga 's ability to capture the sun 's energy with its chlorophyll . while the alga finds security in the moisture and sturdiness of the fungus . Lichens are among the hardiest and most resistant of all organisms . They thrive on outcroppings in the Arctic and Antarctic , on rocks in sun-parched deserts , in the harsh climate of mountaintops , and even ? it habeen speculated ? on Mars . Lichens supply much of the winter food arctic reindeer and caribou . They provide the base for special perfumes . From them come litmus pigments and certain dyes .

Then , with the speed of a clock 's hour hand , the mold would pour between decayed leaves , through humus crevices , and over rotted twigs , feeding as it grew . In a few hours , at most a few days , the mass would work its way out of the shadows to the surface of a log or stump where the air was dryer . Motion would stop . The mass would dry out . And a new crop of spore-laden bristles would emerge . Caught by a vagrant breath of air , a cloud of spores would swirl away to repeat that generation-to-generation cycle which is the warp and woof of all living things , from fungus to man .
