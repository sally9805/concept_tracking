The Way It Is <P> Sir : As a regular listener to CBS news , I heartily agree with you on the authoritative , relevant and objective newscasting by Walter Cronkite Oct. 14 . When Walter concludes his daily assortment of often unpleasant news with " That 's the way it is , October . . . , " somehow I feel this silent remark , " and I ca n't do a thing about it . " <P> <P> MASATO TAKAHASHI , M.D. <P> Los Angeles <P> Sir : Who can forget Walter 's tremendous coverage of the Kennedy assassination ? I can still hear his emotion-laden voice as he tried to keep control . It was an insight into his character for him to reveal himself as a warm human being ; to let the world know that he felt the same as the rest of us during those black hours . <P> <P> ( MRS . ) VIVIEN BEIRLEIN <P> Northville , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : Unlike Huntley and Brinkley , Walter Cronkite has no need of " sly side comments " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detect his views on any given story by observing his facial expression at the conclusion of an on-the-scene report . <P> BRYAN WILSON <P> Waco , Texas <P> Sir : Americans seem to repudiate stiff-backed reporters who blandly mouth the words , but on the other hand have all the time in the world to listen to a shirt-sleeved next-door neighbor like Cronkite . It would be interesting to see him some night speaking into an old carbon mike from a rickety desk , being televised from an old television camera of dubious condition , and reading from copy that is so red-penciled it 's hardly legible . The bets are down that he could still get more across to his news-thirsty viewers than anybody else . <P> <P> JOHN N. SAVAGE <P> Toledo , Ohio <P> Sir : Your cover story on Cronkite points up one terrible truth . Image is the thing . This is true in newscasting , politics and ( pardon ) the press . <P> Lincoln would n't have a chance today . He was homely , poor and honest and in addition , had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by today 's shallow standards . The build up of unqualified candidates via TV and the news media is disgusting . <P> <P> ( MRS . ) D. R. SHOUP <P> Charlotte , N.C. <P> <P> Sir : The electronic front page will soon present living war in every cold blooded American home . What more could the American public ask for ? I hope the commercials will be appropriate and well timed . I would hate to miss seeing my cousin killed . <P> CHRIS BUYS <P> Graduate Student <P> University of Colorado <P> Boulder , Colo . <P> Sir : Let 's see on TV pictures of the Viet Cong prison camp where they chained and tried to kill some of their prisoners . <P> <P> EDWARD CLARKE <P> New York City <P> Secret Ballot
