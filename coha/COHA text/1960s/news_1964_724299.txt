txt School Supt. Benjamin C. Willis forecast yesterday that 19 6 5 revenue will fall 3 million dollars short of the amount necessary to maintain current programs i n Chicago schools . In a detailed summary to the board of education , he said that school revenue next year will increase more than 16 million dollars to $322,697,829 . The figure takes into account an increase of 3 cents for each $100 of assessed valuation to $2.34 , the statutory school tax rate limit . Willis said that revenue for the educational fund , which takes up most of the tax dollar , will increase to $237,585,906 . Up 7 Million , but Need 10 This represents an increase of $7,342,227 over this year 's fund , he said , but the board will need 10 million dollars to keep pace with burgeoning enrollment , which has jumped 14,000 since June . Willis pointed out that the educational fund increase does not provide for teacher salary increases . The board has been under pressure from the Chicago Teachers ' union for more pay next year . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board . " We do not have enough funds to carry forward the present program . You have no place to go except a referendum . " Voters Could Raise Rate The statutory tax limit could be raised by 15 cents if voters approved such a step in a referendum next spring , but the extra revenue still would not be available to the board until 1966 . Willis said that he will meet today with the Illinois School Problems commission ? composed of state legislators who recommend laws regarding schools ? and ask that the state make up Chicago 's 3 million dollar deficit . Willis indicated that textbooks will be another budget problem next year , with only $92,865 added to the 1964 appropriation of $3,432,368 far this item despite enrollment increases . Willis forecast that building fund revenues would increase $7,942,976 to $40,570,376 next year , but he noted that most of the expected increase was based on a prediction that 7 million dollars would be left over from the 1964 fund . " Leftover " May Vanish However , the anticipated leftover probably will not exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because contracts are to be let for construction of the new Jones Commercial High school and several elementary schools . " State sources of revenue need to be used to pick up the tab for the unique education problems of our large cities , " Willis said in noting that he will put in a request for more state aid . The state now guarantees that $252 a year will be available for the education of each child in Illinois . Willis said this should be raised to at least $400 . Gives Pupil Transfer Data The superintendent also announced to the board that 30 Chicago public high schools would be " sending " schools and 10 would be " receiving " schools in the board 's transfer plan . Altho several high schools were left off the list for various reasons , the rule of thumb is that any high school operating at 125 per cent or more of capacity is a " sending " school , and any school with enrollment under that figure is a " receiving school . " The receiving schools , Willis said , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin , Wells , Phillips , Calumet , Englewood , and Tilden . Willis said meetings would be held to explain the transfer plan to students in the " sending schools " and their parents . The transfers will be completed by Nov. 2 , he said . Mobile Classrooms Urged One school board member , Mrs. Lydon Wild , asked the board to provide mobile ehuccrooms at O'Keeffe Elementary school , 6940 Merrill ay. , but Willis said there were many other schools more crowded than O'Keeffe and that they should have priority in getting the mobile units . " If we had 203 more mobile classrooms , no school in Chicago would have an average class size of more than 32.5 pupils , " Willis said . He added , however , that he would look into the possibility of renting mobile classrooms for the O'Keeffe school . Frank M. Whiston , board president , said that next year 's budget would provide for the purchase of 65 to 100 mobile classrooms . The school board now owns 265 , all of which are in use . The board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Hauser report . Willis estimated that the changes would bring about the transfer of 1,455 elementary pupils from overcrowded to underused schools . In all , 28 schools would be affected .
