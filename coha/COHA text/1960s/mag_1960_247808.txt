Though U.S. carriers complain that TCA can chop fares only because it has government support , U.S. lines will probably have to follow suit to stay competitive ( See BUSINESS ) . Bound to suffer : Canada 's railroads , which already lose money on their cross-continent runs ( one-way tourist fare , including a berth but no meals or extras : $115.40 ) .
