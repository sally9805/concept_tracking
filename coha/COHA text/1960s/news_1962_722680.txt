txt As auto makers start introducing 1963 models , they are juggling some prices and styles . The result is likely to be little net increase from 1962 in prices of comparable models . But the auto men hope the changes will pad their profit margins nevertheless . Mostly , they are trying to take advantage of what they see as a trend . There are signs that car buyers , after flirting with parsimony for four years , are increasingly returning to an old habit which auto men call " buying up . " This means that instead of insisting that a salesman sell them the compact with a sixcylinder engine and a manual shift , more buyers are casting fond eyes at , say , the convertible V-8 with lots of extras . To try to make such a trend more profitable , auto makers are putting more of the fancier styles in their 1963 line-ups and are shedding some austerity models . In some cases they axe making some formerly optional equipment standard equipment and raising prices to cover the additions . 111rst Inkling From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last weekend when Chrysler Corp . announced prices on 1963 Chryslers and Imperials , due to appear in showrooms tomorrow . Prices on the luxury Imperial rose , but the company standardized some former options such as power windows . One Chrysler model went up , five went down and seven were unchanged . The average price cut was about equal to the average increase . Some Rambler dealers report tentative prices on 1963 models call for an average increase of 0.6% despite sharp restyling of the larger Classic and Ambassador lines . Actual , increases may run $30 to $40 on the more expensive cars , although two station wagons are expectdd to drop $20 . The compact Rambler American is expected to remain unchanged . These cars are n't due to appear until Oct. 5 , so the company could still change its plans as it his , so dealers report , in the past . A more - Immediate clue to the 1963 pricing pattern will come later this week when . Fords and Chevrolet* hit the market . Chevrolet will be the sfirst General Motors 1963 make in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prices because no company can afford to let the giant producer undersell it to any significant extent . They argue that GM , with half a dozen antitrust suits filed against it , has enough trouble with the Government without risking President Kennedy 's wrath over a price increase . Further , GM probably will have its most profitable year in history this year , so it- ca n't plead need . Thus , so the argument goes , GM wo n't increase prices to any important degree . ? " Considering the political climate , and its profit picture , I do n't see GM raising prices mulch this year , " comments the president of a competing company . GM is keeping its plans to itself . Like others , it does n't announce ? price* until cars are introduced . No Boosts for Parts Makers Another sign that car prices are n't going to rise much is that auto parts suppliers say they 've been unable to extract higher prices from auto makers . " We have n't been able to get anything at all , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says one big parts company . Several of the auto makers could make good cases that they " need more money for their products . Studebaker Corp . will lose money tan the automotive end of its business this year , &though; profits from other divisions problably will put it into . the black . Chrysler Corp . ' s return on sales is far lower than that of GM or Ford . American Motors Corp . ' s return on sales has been slipping ; the company says this is partly because it has been putting more into its cars without compensating price increases . But General Motors already is a tough enough competitor for these companies without them giving it an additional advantage in pricing . Instead , several are trying other tactics to try to improve their profit position and take advantage of the freer spending mood of car buyers . For instance , Chrysler Corp . dropped the compact Lancer from the Dodge line for 1963 , making the Dart , which is slightly larger , the cheapest car Dodge will offer . So anyone wanting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25 to $50 more that a Dart costs over the old Lancer . In 1982 the Mercury Monterey had a 170-horsepower V-8 engine as standard equipment , although a determined economy seeker could buy a 188-horsepower six-cylinder engine for $101 less . But in 1983 , both of these engines have been dropped and the standard power plant will be a 250-horsepower V-8 , which probably will boost the cost of the standard Monterey by $100 over 1962 . Studebaker Corp . for 1968 is dropping what in 1962 was its cheapest series of Larks , the DeLuxe ; the bottom of the line in 1983 will be the Regal , which was the top of the line previously . As a result , the cheapest Lark will cost $100 or so more than a year ago . But auto men figure that most buyers will lay out more money because they want to . " Buying up " reached dizzying heights in 1955 , when many former Chevy and Ford drivers acted on the urge to own Oldsmobile ! , Mercury ' and DeSotos . But in 1958 , buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tide has now turned back away from economy are varied . Sales of cars with more costly V-8 engines , which slipped from 80% of the market in 1957 to 50% in 1961 , climbed back to 56% in the 1962 model year . Almost every auto division reports that the middle or top-priced seriea , of individual car lines now sell in the greatest volume .
