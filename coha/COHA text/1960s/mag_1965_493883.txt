THE ' 66 BUDGET War Takes Precedence over the Creat Society by george L. Terry The war in Vietnam will dominate the economic scene in 1966 , as the tax cut dominated it this year and last . The budget for this fiscal year , which ends with June 1966 , was recently revised upward $5 billion to $7 billion from the original January estimate of $99.7 billion . Increases came mainly from additional defense spending , not from Great Society programs . For fiscal 1967 , rising defense outlays alone are likely to boost the budget several billion dollars higher . The Administration 's reactions thus far have been remarkably calm and sound , even compared with the early Kennedy Administration just four years ago . In the fall of 1961 , a defense buildup triggered by the Berlin wall had the Administration on the brink of asking for tax increases ? at a time when the unemployment rate was over 6 percent , and prospects for achieving the stated 4 percent target in the foreseeable future were negligible . Only determined resistance by Walter Heller 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion . Early this fall , unemployment was already below 4.5 percent and a larger military buildup was in store ; yet Gardner Ackley 's Council and other Administration officials quickly declarel that the economic outlook as of then did not call for tax increases to pay for the war . However , by the timethe new budget is presented to Congress in January , developments now unfolding could alter the Administration 's stand on tax increases . To assess what the war will mean to the economy and what decisions will confront Administration planners , we must see first how the overall economic outlook shapes up in view of the prospective defense budget and the indicated strength of private demands for next year . This is not easy . Firm estimates on the budget cost of Vietnam do not exist outside official circles and probably not inside the government either . Not long ago , an increase in total federal purchases of some $5 billion was the standard forecast ; but the revised estimates for the fiscal 1966 budget suggest this may be too low . Assume that federal purchases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $6 billion increase in defense spending ; that business investment will rise by as much as in lobs ; and that automobile sales and homebuilding will stay around this year 's levels . Then we have what I think will be the median forecast made in the next month or two , showing ano:l ; er year of strong advances , with the gain in real ou'put matching the 5 percent rise we are getting this year , and unemployment falling throughout the year , going below 4 percent for all of 1966 and reaching a level of 3.5 percent by the end of next year . The government 's fiscal activities affect this outlook through many channels other than the increase in federal purchases . In 1966 excise taxes will fall further as the second stage of this year 's tax bill takes effect . Social Security taxes will increase , both on employers and employees . Medicare payments start in the second half of the year . But the net effect of these changes on incomes and output will be negative and small whereas the impact of the assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , adding perhaps $15 billion to next year 's GNP and in the process creating over a million jobs in the private economy . Without the defense increases , the growth in output expected for 1066 would not absorb the growth in the labor force . The government today would be readying expansionary measures in the form of tax reduction and expanded civilian spending to keep the economy growing fast enough . Now the rise in defense purchases will fuel our sixth year of continued expansion and third straight year of extraordinary gains in output and employment . Are such gains excessive ? Do they call for a cut in civilian programs , tighter money , increased taxes ? Foremost among those who worry that the economy is going too far , too fast , is the Federal Reserve . The Fed has been raising interest rates since summer , with the recent hike in the discount rate the latest . The past five months mark the third period since mid-1963 that short-term interest rates have been pushed higher ; and , of much greater importance , this time long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at historically high levels despite the strong pressure against tighter money coming from the Administration . We are also certain to witness renewed congressional opposition to federal spending on civilian programs . Representative George Mahon , chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , has already called for a slowdown in spending funds already appropriated , and a determined stand against approving any marginal new programs . Mahon generally supported Johnson 's Great Society proposals in this year 's session . Traditional opponents of federal spending will be all the more adamant in their resistance . The case for monetary restraint , and for fiscal steps to offset part of the impact of rising defense purchases , must rest on concern about inflation and the balance of payments . The case against such measures must rest on a desire for further cuts in unemployment , and on the belief that inflation will be kept under control and the balance of payments handled adequately by methods that do not restrict the economy 's expansion . There is good reason to think this can be done in 1966 , despite the large gains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guideposts It is true that typically as unemployment rates fall and the economy operates closer to its potential , upward pressures develop on wages and prices . But in assessing the inflationary threat for 1966 , the more relevant experience is 1965 , not 1955 , for its lesson is that the terms on which we trade inflation for unemployment have improved . The most visible new ingredient is the Council 's wage-price guideposts and the various specific ways in which pressure for conformity to the guideposts has been applied , but there are other differences with 1955 as well . Competition from foreign producers exerts a stronger discipline on US producers today than ten years ago , and also , the investment surge of the present expansion has been adding new and modernized capacity in pace with the expansion of output . The most recent McGraw-Hill survey shows that , despite the sharp output gains of the past year , average operating rates in manufacturing industries are actually down slightly , being an estimated 87 percent of capacity this fall , compared with 88 percent last December and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid buildup in capacity , the expected pace of business investment promises to hold operating rates around present levels in the face of the projected 5 percent gain in real output . Thus , inflation stemming from generalized pressures on capacity is not a threat for next year ; and , looking at particular industries , the prospects for adequate capacity right down the line are equally good . The two major industries that reported operating rates above preferred levels are automobiles and nonferrous metals . Both , however , are in the midst of large investment programs that are rapidly adding to and modernizing their production facilities . In addition , automobile output is expected to rise only modestly , if at all , next year , and the government is relieving tight supply conditions in the critical nonferrous metals by putting portions of its huge stockpiles on the market . The prospects for stable costs also look promising from the side of the labor market . We enter 1966 with the lowest unemployment rate in a decade , but also with an excellent record of price stability and wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly established . What is more , 1966 will be a year unusually free of major collective bargaining agreements which might threaten a break from the moderate pace of wage increases . Most major industries have reached long-term agreements within the past year or two , including the important automobile , steel and aluminum settlements . While some of these stretched the wage guideposts , none were out of line with productivity gains in the individual industries involved and thus should not be exerting upward pressures on unit costs in the coming year . President Johnson 's fight to keep this year 's government pay increases within the guideposts emphasizes anew the Administration 's determination on this score . Some threat exists of an upward wage drift through upgrading job specifications , but this has not been a major factor in postwar US experience . Finally , the lower unemployment rate of under 4 percent projected for next year may overstate the tightness of the labor market then . The projection assumes an increase in the armed forces of some 3oo,000 men next year , and also that more than 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Society manpower programs . Both groups would have above-average jobless rates in the private economy . All these considerations suggest that next year , even with the stimulus of a $7 billion increase in total federal purchases , the economy will suffer only moderate price increases . Some step-up from the virtual price stability of the high unemployment years has got to be expected . But the increase in major price indexes like the Consumer Price Index and the GNP price deflator should be limited to about 2 percent and average wholesale prices should rise by a little less than this . Together with the projected 5 percent gain in real output , a 2 percent increase in the GNP deflator would mean a $720 billion GNP for 1966 , 7 percent or $40 billion above this year 's level . Improving the Balance of Payments If the threat of real inflation seems remarkably under control , however , there still remains the persistent and serious problem of the balance of payments . The continuing surge in direct investment abroad by US firms has thus far frustrated government efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monetary system , including machinery that permits more flexibility in currency exchange rates , may relieve the restraints that international finance today imposes on economic policy here and elsewhere . But substantial improvement in the present US payments position may well be a necessary precondition to successful negotiations . The Administration is anything but indifferent to our balance of payments problem , but rather than resort to still tighter money and deflationary fiscal measures , it has chosen to contain capital outflows directly , and now will put increasing pressure on direct investment overseas . Much of big business , and many economists , are critical of this interference , but the Administration 's way is working , and further improvement in the bidance of payments can be expected next year as long as an outbreak of real inflation is avoided . Yet the Vietnam war has already inflicted some wounds on the economy . Despite rising interest rates , business investment spending will apparently continue its sharp rise under the stimulus of past tax measures and growing markets ; borrowing for homebuilding and for the needs of states and localities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tax reductions that in early summer were in prospect , reportedly aimed at relief of lower income groups , have long since been put aside . Even without congressional pruning , some spending for the Great Society will be scaled down and stretched out for the duration . it would be damaging if the Administration next year lost the delicate balance between rapid output gains and reasonable price stability that it has thus far achieved . But if both the rise in defense spending and the normal expansion of domestic programs can be accomplished with only modest price increases next year , there should be little need to restrain domestic programs . This is the great strength of our powerful and rapidly growing economy and we should not hesitate to rely on it . In framing next year 's economic plans we can and should push the unemployment rate down from present levels . The success thus far with price stability commands a rethinking of how far we can go , with an occasional brush back when some sector or other gets out of line , before inflation becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , whatever manpower programs we devise , the next million men in today 's hiring line wo n't find work until the unemployment rate is pushed down to around 3 percent . Labor market and manpower policies will help assure that this goal is achieved with a minimum of inflationary consequences . But demand must eventually create the jobs . Nobody can say yet whether a move to 3 percent unemployment is consistent with a tolerable rate of price increase . Next year offers a chance to test our ability by taking the necessary next step in that direction . Forecasting is uncertain and the cost of , next year 's defense needs have only been guessed at here . It may be that they will use up all and more of the federal spending rise that we can risk without courting serious inflation . But what one should fear is that domestic programs will be cut as part of a grand gesture of prudence and national sacrifice , rather than after careful weighing of economic risks . In this case , as is too often true , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find jobs in next year 's economy . What if the cost of the defense buildup does turn out sub3tantially larger than the $6 billion increase I have assumed ' By January 1066 defense purchases could be projected $8 billion or $10 billion above this year 's level . Indeed , Congressman Mahon spoke in terms of the latter figui In this case , the threat of an overheated economy would be far greater and economic planning would properly move toward fiscal restraint . Being most vulnerable , Great Society programs could be cut down sharply in this environment . We would trade domestic social needs for the needs of the war . But such a trade is not the only one available to us . If the size of the defense buildup demands it , the Administration should be prepared to raise taxes next year . A rise of $1.0 billion in defense purchases coupled with a $5 billion emergency tax increase would yield much the same forecast for the economy as I have described above . The most important public programs could even expand moderately . With private spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output and employment would be no larger than before and not so large as to threaten serious inflation . Finally , there is the possibility that defense needs will still be uncertain when budget plans and the main outlines of economic policy for the year are finally formed about mid-January . In this case , the 1966 fore-cast may be too uncertain to justify asking Congress for tax increases . Yet the risks of too much expansion may require an overly-cautious ceiling on civilian programs . Here the inherent uncertainty of next year 's outlook could be met by a highly constructive kind of proposal from the Administration . This would be a request for standby authority to change tax rates if the situation turned out to require it . Such proposals have been advanced before as necessary tools of antirecession policy . If we are serious about running our economy at full employment , we should seek tax flexibility in both directions . And the maiden run on such a scheme may well be most acceptable to the Congress if it is made in an environment where the President might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax flexibility is long overdue . If available next year , when a request for it would be hard to deny , it should permit a much bolder and more constructive program . It would protect against marginal risks for next year , and give the Administration a much-needed tool of stabilization policy for the longer run .
