He who is not sage and wise , humane and just , can not use secret agents . And he who is not delicate and subtle can not get the truth out of them . <P> - Sun Tzu , The Art of War <P> On the battlefield in Viet Nam and at the peace talks in Paris , the counsel of U.S. intelligence analysts weighs heavily . For it is as true today as it was around 400 B.C. , when Sun Tzu wrote China 's oldest manual of arms , that those whose trade is to uncover an enemy 's secrets " receive their instructions within the tent of the general and are intimate and close to him . " Yet when Richard Nixon becomes Commander in Chief , he will need an extraordinary measure of sagacity , wisdom , humanity and justice-not to mention delicacy and subtlety-to discern the truth in the reports prepared for him by Washington 's intelligence operatives . As Inauguration Day approaches , the capital 's cloak-and-dagger community is bickering furiously over Viet Nam . <P> Each group is preparing to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks , " an official predicts , " there is going to be one hell of a battle . " At stake in what some observers call the War for Nixon 's Ear is the direction the President-elect will take in his search for peace . <P> One group of analysts is convinced that the Communists , bloodied by 180,000 battlefield deaths so far this year , have battered themselves to the brink of impotence . If this reading is accurate , concessions can be wrung from Communist negotiators in Paris through astute haggling , reinforced by military muscle against a weakened Viet Cong . <P> <P> But if a second group is right , no amount of tough talk is likely to budge Hanoi . While the pessimists concede that the enemy has been hurt , they insist that he still has plenty of fight left , with the will and capability for a prolonged struggle . The most drastic division of opinion concerns the part-time guerrillas known as hamlet guards . Pessimists set their strength at 250,000 ; optimists contend that they are not effective troops and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The intelligence quandary would be easier for Nixon to unsnarl if each segment of Government argued with one voice-with , say , the State Department citing political considerations to counterpoint the military contentions of the Pentagon . That has been known to happen . In 1963 , after listening to conflicting reports from a general and a diplomat who had just returned from a joint mission to Viet Nam , President Kennedy was moved to inquire : " Have you two gentlemen been in the same country ? " <P> Unfortunately , this time the Defense Department , the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department are all split themselves . The State Department 's Bureau of Intelligence and Research wears a gloomy mien that irks Secretary of State Dean Rusk and the optimistic deskmen of the East Asian bureau . In the Pentagon , the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Defense Intelligence Agency are assembling a rosy picture of a seriously weakened enemy and a greatly improved South Vietnamese military machine , a vision shared by U.S. Commander General Creighton Abrams and his headquarters in Saigon . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far more skeptical . <P>
