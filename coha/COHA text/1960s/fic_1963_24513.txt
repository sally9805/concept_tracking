CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELD 'S LAP A white cat rests in his lap and he pets it . BLOFELD ( O.S. ) Except for the occasional one such as we have here ... CLOSE SHOT - AQUARIUM The fish swim around each other and then , in quick cuts , fight each other .

BLOFELD Come in , Kronsteen . Sit down , Number Three ... CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELD 'S CAT He continues to stroke it . BLOFELD ... while we listen to what Number Five has devised for us . CLOSE-UP - KLEB KLEB I hope Kronsteen 's efforts as Director of Planning will continue to be as successful as his chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your instructions , I have planned for SPECTRE to steal from the Russians their new Lektor decoding machine . For this we need the services of a female member of the Russian cryptograph section in Turkey and - uh - the help of the British Secret Service . CLOSE-UP - KLEB Listening , she looks up at Kronsteen . KRONSTEEN ( O.S. ) ( continuing ) Naturally , neither the Russians nor the British will be aware ... CLOSE-UP - BLOFELD 'S CAT He continues to pet it . KRONSTEEN ( O.S. ) ( continuing ) ... that they are now working for us . BLOFELD ( O.S. ) Number Three , is your section ready to carry out Kronsteen 's directives ? CLOSE-UP - KLEB KLEB Yes , Number One . The operation will be organized according to Kronsteen 's plan .

Moscow has kept my defection secret from everyone but a few members of the Presidium . CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELD 'S CAT As he stroke it : BLOFELD For your sake , I hope so . BLOFELD 'S POV - KLEB AND KRONSTEEN BLOFELD ( O.S. ) Kronsteen , you 're sure this plan is foolproof ? KRONSTEEN ( tapping a cigarette against its case ) Yes , it is , because I have anticipated every possible variation of counter-move . CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELD 'S CAT As he strokes it : BLOFELD But what makes you think that ' M , ' the head of British intelligence , will oblige you by falling in with your plan ? CLOSE-UP - KRONSTEEN KRONSTEEN For the simple reason that it is so obviously a trap . ( he starts to put the cigarette into his mouth then lowers it ) My reading of the British mentality is that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case , they could n't possibly pass up even the slightest chance of getting their hands on a Lektor decoder . They have wanted one for years . CLOSE SHOT - BLOFELD 'S CAT As he strokes it : BLOFELD ( O.S. ) Um-hmm . All that you say could be true . What else ? CLOSE-UP - KRONSTEEN KRONSTEEN As an added refinement , I think that SPECTRE would probably have the added chance of a personal revenge for the killing of our operative , Doctor No . Because the man the British will almost certainly use on a mission of this sort would be their agent , James Bond . ANGLE OVER BLOFELD AT KLEB AND KRONSTEEN BLOFELD Let his death be a particularly unpleasant and humiliating one . KRONSTEEN Good . I shall put my plan into operation straightaway .

MOVING SHOT Kleb , Morzeny and Rhoda walk across the grounds . MORZENY This Grant 's one of the best men we 've ever had . Homicidal paranoiac , superb material . Though his methods were a little crude , his response to our training and indoctrination have been remarkable . EXT .

KLEB Then you will not leave this room alive . Tania looks at her aghast , then regains her composure . TANIA I will obey your orders . ANGLE ON KLEB She rises from the desk , then we PAN on her as she crosses behind Tania . KLEB Good . Now these are your instructions . You report to me here . TANIA Yes .
