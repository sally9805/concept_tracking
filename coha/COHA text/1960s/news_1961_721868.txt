In spite of the road 's objection , , the painters have won their point  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' red trim will remain until the scheduled painting , the spokesman said . As , for the two outhouses with the kicked out sides the Milwaukee road will see , that they are gone within a week . But that work will be done by a ' crew hired , bY.ftlita : road . The spokesman . Made that point clear .
