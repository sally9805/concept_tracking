Back in 1927 , the same year that Charles Lindbergh made his heroic solo flight across the Atlantic , a young Yale University graduate named Juan Terry Trippe founded a modest air service that shuttled mail between Florida and Cuba . Both events have loomed large in the history of aviation . Lindbergh 's flight pointed up aviation 's expanding potential , and Trippe 's little business eventually grew into Pan American World Airways , the world 's largest international airline . Last week in Manhattan , when Trippe , now 68 , finally bowed out as Pan Am 's boss , it seemed altogether fitting that Lindbergh , long a Pan Am technical consultant and now one of its directors , was on hand for the occasion . <P> A commercial-aviation pioneer cut from the same mold as Eastern Air Lines ' Eddie Rickenbacker , United 's William A. Patterson and American 's C. R. Smith , Trippe was the last of them to relinquish command . And the manner of his departure was typical of the reticent executive . Presiding over Pan Am 's annual shareholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top brass first got the word themselves , he casually dropped the news at the end of a 45-minute speech on company finances . When 62-year-old President Harold E. Gray , his hand-picked successor as Pan Am 's chairman and chief executive officer , began to praise him , Trippe abruptly ruled him out of order . Sighed Gray : " I seldom defy the boss . " <P> Up &; Down . Few ever did . A man of both vision and vigor who honed his boyhood interest in aviation as a Navy pilot during World War I , New Jersey-born Trippe ruled his airline with a firm hand . After establishing Pan Am as the first carrier to offer regular international service , he engaged in what amounted to a one-man diplomatic mission in order to negotiate landing rights in South America . In the 1930s , with his line 's South American routes already well established , he became the first to introduce scheduled airline service across both the Pacific and the Atlantic . Under Trippe 's innovative direction , Pan Am was also the first airline to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio communications , the first to employ multiple flight crews . <P> As the popularity of air travel went up and fares went down , Trippe 's early prediction that aviation would make neighborhoods out of nations was largely fulfilled . Today , Pan Am flies into 86 countries on six continents along a route system covering over 80,000 miles . A privately run line that draws much of its competition from government-owned foreign carriers , Pan Am has grown from an original stake of $300,000 into a company with assets of over $1 billion and revenues that last year reached a record $950.2 million .
