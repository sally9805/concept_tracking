The biggest of them all was really only waiting until it was ready . Last week Boston 's Gillette Co. , the world 's largest maker of razor blades ( 7 billion last year ) , announced that it too will market a stainless steel blade . The new blades will be distributed first in New York and Philadelphia and then to the rest of Gillette 's 3,500 distributors and 500,000 retail outlets . Gillette thus becomes the third major U.S. company to go stainless , and its entry into the field signals the start of what is certain to be a bitter competition for the growing U.S. stainless blade market . <P> <P> Gillette entered the field with some reluctance . It could afford to ignore the success of Britain 's venerable Wilkinson Sword Ltd. , which has been unable to meet demand ever since it began selling its Super Sword-Edge stainless blades in the U.S. 18 months ago . But demand for the stainless blades lured Gillette competitors Schick ( Krona Plus ) and American Safety Razor ( Personna and PAL ) into the field-and Gillette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months experimenting before it was convinced that it could mass-produce stainless steel blades of uniform quality ; the chrome carbide particles in stainless steel make it more difficult to sharpen than the carbon steel that is used in most razor blades . Gillette will produce its stainless blades in a new $10 million addition to its Boston plant , which is capable of producing more stainless blades in a week than the 7,000,000 exported to the U.S. by Wilkinson last year . <P> Priced at six for 89 , Gillette 's blades will be slightly cheaper than Super Swords ( five for 75 ) or Personna and Krona Plus ( five for 79 ) . Though it plans to spend a hefty $4,000,000 to introduce its new blades , Gillette finds itself in the ironic position of hoping that they will not be a runaway success . Since the company already sells 70% of all the blades bought in the U.S. , a too-spectacular acceptance could only mean a sales decline for its established lines . <P> Worse yet , if the stainless blade lasts for too many shaves ( some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean a cut in Gillette 's total sales . Says Mark Litchfield , Gillette 's assistant treasurer : " If the stainless steel blade gives twelve shaves or more , we could have some real problems . "
