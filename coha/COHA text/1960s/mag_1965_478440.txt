Last March the Rockefeller Foundation 's report on The Performing Arts : Problems and Prospects was published to delighted wails of dismay . Finally the deplorable financial state of the theater , the opera , the symphony , the dance . and other interpretive arts had been documented , and it was just as terrible as the most morose critics of our culture had said it was . The documented starvation of the arts came as a relief if not as a surprise to theatrical critics and music reviewers and balletomanes ; the truth was out and it was supported by a panel of businessmen , foundation executives , academics , and editors . The gloom was official . Finally it had been said out loud that the serious performing arts could never be self-supporting , nor should they try to be . They need subsidy , and on this occasion it was not the federal government that was named as the niggardly party but the members of the business community who were said to fall far behind in their proper cultural payments . On February 10 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Southern Methodist University in Dallas received a gift , from the chairman of Texas Instruments and his wife , of $200,000 for the establishment of a theater . ( Among Dallas 's principal cultural ornaments is its repertory theater housed in one of Frank Lloyd Wright 's last buildings . ) On February 24 President Johnson announced the composition of the National Council on the Arts with a real-estate man , Roger L. Stevens , as its chairman . There was some murmuring at the time that the names on the Council 's roster were more ornamental than useful . ( August Heckscher , President Kennedy 's adviser on cultural matters , was strangely missing from the list . ) Two weeks after the Rockefeller report was issued , Los Angeles opened a spanking new $11,500,000 art museum , which followed by just four months the opening of a $33,500,000 music center . Not to be outdone ( at least not by much ) a San Franciscan proposed a bond issue of $24,000,000 for a cultural center " that will be the envy of every city in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughes of New Jersey had proposed a month before for his own state . His was to be a mere $1,500,000 building to be designed by Edward Durrell Stone and financed by Jersey road tolls . If the performing arts are starving , they are certainly not being ignored in high places . The climate of the arts is a curiously mixed dappling of official sunshine and private shadow , For all the sun that shines on the arts today ( and a good deal does ) , there is a kind of smog in the atmosphere . Some of the smog , to stretch the metaphor , conies from industrial smoke ? the results of our concern with material and creature comforts at the expense of spiritual comforts . Some of it , however , is an excess of goodwill , which produces inevitably an intellectual and sentimental fog . It appears that the arts have too many well-meaning acquaintances and friends and too few lovers . It is characteristic not only of artists but of many of the friends and supporters of the arts to think that the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the arts than earlier ages and societies . There seems to be a perpetual nostalgia in the world of the arts that harks back to " golden ages " of patronage which , it seems to be generally believed , treated the arts with awesome respect , when artists were revered and pampered and quarreled over by the wealthy and well-placed and were looked up to as demigods by the lowly . Such ages placed garlands on the brow of Sophocles and lined the coffers of Leonardo and Titian with gold . They lavished commissions on the Brunelleschis and the Bramantes and Berninis . Presumably , the golden glow of such patronage vanished with the twilight of the aristocratic society and the end of the eighteenth century , though opera and theater , the darlings of the haute bourgeoisie and the polite monarchies , thrived in the nineteenth . People who harbor this romantic notion of what patronage was like are very apt to cherish an equally romantic notion which is largely of nineteenth-century origin . This is the conviction that it is the fate of the serious artist to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a few of his contemporaries , that he is far ahead of his time and therefore misunderstood and either vilified or ignored . It is a curious characteristic of our attitude toward the arts today ( it is evident in the Rockefeller report ) to harbor both of these contradictory notions ? the golden-age notion and the **27;2200;TOOLONG notion and , what is more interesting , to want to perpetuate them both . We want to have our cake and be hungry too . The artist today wants to combine the status that he is presumed to have enjoyed under aristocratic patronage with the freedom that was forced upon him and the way of life that he assumed with the disappearance of the old princes and prelates . He wants the best of two worlds ? and who can blame him ? He wants to live comfortably and give the effect of sleeping on a pad ; he wants to be well paid by a society whose wealth and values be castigates , and he wants to he pampered and left strictly alone ? as who does n't ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist has come closer to achieving in our society than in any society that has preceded it . One runs the risk of being labeled a Philistine ( I run it now ) if he contends that the serious artist has almost never before had it so good , never been more free , never had more devoted followers , more people wanting to understand and help him . Patronage , in other words , has achieved a kind of open-handedness which is equaled only by its open-mindedness . There are aspects of today 's climate of patronage that are crisp and exacting and invigorating both to the patron and to the artist ; they are not common , but especially in the world of architecture and of design they seem to be increasing . There are aspects of the climate that are dreary and discouraging , and they are largely , I gather from the Rockefeller report , where the arts are interpretive rather than creative . The climate of patronage ? sometimes docile , sometimes vigorous , sometimes hazy ? is , of course , a social phenomenon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is individuals , it is committees , and it is governments municipalities , states , and nations . These are the people who want art . They are the source of the artist 's livelihood and to some extent of his inspiration . What do they look like ? First the individual patron ? presumably the one who knows what he likes , is willing to pay for it , and can take the consequences of his opinion . . . In our time the man who patronizes an artist usually does so through an intermediary of some sort ? an agent , a gallery , an expert . It is the exception rather than the rule that a first-quality collection of paintings represents solely the taste of the person who pays for them . Private collections are not today amassed on quite the same scale as they were in the days when Frick and Havemeyer and Widener and Altman were being coached and cajoled by such dealers as Duveen and covering the walls of their massive houses with what are now the principal treasures of our museums . But these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works by their contemporaries . Today the collector of old masters is the exception . It is true that a Rembrandt , like the " Titus " sold at auction in London last spring , can command upwards of two million dollars from a private collector , but the fashionable collector now ? the one who spends considerable sums on the arts ? is a collector of his contemporaries or of the recent past . He pays $375,000 for a Gauguin and $75,000 for a work by Cha.gall , who is still vigorously painting , or more than that for one by Andrew Wyeth , who is a relatively young man . The fashionable collector buys partly on the advice of a dealer or agent or several dealers , and partly on the example or advice of museums and their knowing , exploring , and sophisticated experts . The era in which the individual patron ordered up a work of art for a specific place and purpose seems , except in the case of architects and of the corporate patron , to have ended . Individual patrons buy what the artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of how or where they will be used . To many artists no situation could be more delightful . Henry Moore was quoted in this magazine a few months ago as saying , " I hate cornAFTER HOURS missions , " and yet he is one of the most frequently and richly commissioned sculptors of this century . The ideal patron in his terms is an invisible one . Possibly the ideal patron has always been invisible . When he is recognizable he is likely to be demanding . Michelangelo found it advisable to have an agent stand between him and his patron , Giulio de ' Medici who became Pope Clement VII . After a good deal of haggling Over the tomb sculptures in San Lorenzo in Florence , Michelangelo wrote to his friend and agent , Fatticci , and told him that " . . after eight or nine months the Pope changed his mind and refused to go with it . Since I was faced with large expense , and since his Holiness refused to give me money for the work , one day I complained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me expelled from his chamber . " This was in one of the " golden ages " of patronage , as they are called . Michelangelo added , " I felt insulted and immediately left Rome . " If the situation between the patron and the artist in the golden ages had been as amiable as we like to think , there would not have had to be contractual safeguards to protect the interest of one against the other . Contracts between patrons and artists spelled out to the last detail the grade of colors to be used and the number of figures and their disposition , as in the famous contract for the " Coronation of the Virgin " by Charenton , now in Villeneuve-LesAvignon . " Item : the vestments should be rich , and that of the Virgin of white Damask . " the contract read . It covered several pages and included stipulations about the number of seraphim and cherubim , the use of a special ultramarine from the city of Saint-dean-d ' Acre , except on the frame where " a fine German azure " would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes himself seriously today to permit such a minute spelling out of his intentions . There is , furthermore , no common mythology that binds patron and artist together . It has been some time since a mythology or religion and its familiar visual vocabulary have afforded a common language understood by both patron and artist ? an understanding that is no longer possible or at least no longer desirable except in some cases of church and temple decoration . The artist has achieved his complete freedom , and there is no better evidence of it than the fact that he dictates the terms on which he will be met and the language in which he will speak . It is hardly the language used between lovers . Art is fashionable today and in many respects the newer it is , and the more experimental , the more fashionable it is . This is a situation rare in the annals of art where styles have evolved slowly and lasted long . It is true that great experimenters have sometimes led great patrons down unfamiliar paths that both were eager to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ della Francesca , and Caravaggio and the Cardinal del Monte ) , but 1 can not think of another time when artists have had to keep running in order to stay ahead of their patrons . Fashion is the enemy of art , not its friend , and artists know this . It is difficult to define the ideal individual patron of the artist today . He should be respectful , acquisitive , patient , and above all . rich . It is assumed that if he likes an artist 's work , the artist finds him perceptive and intelligent and sensitive . If he encourages others to buy , then in addition to his other virtues he is credited with generosity ; he is not a hoarder . The same qualities are equally admirable in the patron ( read , " client " ) of the architect . But the architectural patron must be something more ; he must be malleable , like clay , and his convictions must be able to be bent in the direction of sensibility without breaking . One has often heard the phrase that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , the ideal client is intellectually and aesthetically portable . Even the beginning art collector is more acquaintance than lover . He is all too often more concerned with the future of what he buys than with its ( and his ) immediate present . So , more understandably , is the client of the architect , for other reasons . The big patrons today are almost inevitably committees . Unlike the individual patron who knows . presumably , what he likes , the committee does n't know what it likes but presumably knows what it wants . This may sound like a contradiction ; it is n't . Architecture demonstrates this better than painting . The vestry of a church , for example , wants a new church building ; it knows that much , It may even want a church in the modern idiom . . . or some members of the vestry want a " modern " church and some want a Georgian church and some a Gothic church . So they appoint , from among their number a subcommittee whose function is merely to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquire of other committees of other institutions about the names of architects and go to look at examples of their work . Possibly in the process of examining the work of a number of men they may begin to discover what they like as well as what they want , or . more likely , to get themselves into the hands of an architect who sells them on his brand of design . Who are the members of the committee who must be convinced ? There is the chairman of the finance committee or the treasurer , the money man . There is the member of the vestry who is thought to have what are only half-disparagingly called " artistic " interests . Perhaps he is in the so-called " creative " department of an advertising firm , or he has evinced an uncommon interest in architecture by bringing back colored slides of Chartres and the Parthenon from last summer 's trip abroad . Maybe he paints rather than plays golf on Sunday afternoons . So much for the artistic member . There is one member to represent the " feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altar guild whose arrangements of flowers on Sunday are also very artistic . She AFTER HOURS is a presumed aesthete . And there is a fourth member of known common sense and stability to act as a brake on the somewhat suspect enthusiasms of the artistic members . This may be an exaggeration , but I have served on a good many committees which are supposed to represent " cross sections " of opinion . It is unlikely that there is any worse patron of the arts than a cross section , and yet it is the prevailing type of patronage , at least where large sums of money are involved . Large sums are usually spent by institutions , not by individuals , in our time , so that the best ( that is , the most important ) patrons are the best committees . The performing arts suffer at least as severely as the creative arts from committee control . Committee patronage assumes many shapes , for the artist today has not only many friends but many kinds of friends . The art museum as a patron is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists paint with museums in mind as their ultimate customers . They hope to appeal to a curator or a director , who in turn must appeal for approval to a purchasing committee of the institution , a segment of its board . The board is made up largely of what are disparagingly referred to as " bonds , " a term defined by the author of a recent book on the Guggenheim family as " men and women from the business world who insofar as art is concerned are amateurs . " Another part of the board is composed of socially prominent or socially aspiring women . This committee ? or board , a veritable hank vault of goodwill for the arts ? is of inestimable importance in today 's patronage . It controls a great deal of money ; it exerts a considerable influence on taste . The Museum of Modern Art in New York is the most influential committee patron in America , indeed perhaps in the world . It is the taste clinic for masses of aspiring seekersafter-truth and its out-patient department gives generous transfusions to smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants art ? Corporations want it and governments say they want it . There 's no need to dwell on the business corporation as a patron of the arts and especially of architecture ; it is by now an old story that many enlightened corporations have patronized distinguished architects . it is also an old story that many corporations have actively supported contemporary painters and sculptors . The most important corporations from the point of view of today 's patronage are the nonprofit corporations ? educational institutions , art centers , and foundations . However many millions ( perhaps billions ) all such institutions distribute each year to the arts , performing and creative , they do not satisfy the artists ' hunger or , evidently , what is assumed to be the public hunger for art . There is a belief in America , shared by the Rockefeller panel , that anyone who wants to be an artist of whatever sort ought to have the opportunity to become one and that anyone with more than a modicum of talent should be able to support himself by his art . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any society other than ours . It can be argued ( and indeed frequently is ) that the broader the support of the artist , the better the arts will be . There are others , to be sure , who argue that the money , the time , and the trouble should be concentrated on those who have genuine gifts and that the rest be urged to go into other callings . There is also the valid argument that the economy can support a great many more serious artists than it now does if only more people could be taught to love the arts , or at least like them . And this is one reason why government has been called upon to lend its prestige even more than its financial aid to the arts . City governments have been supporting the arts for a long time in various , sometimes almost invisible , ways ? by tax abatements , by direct contributions to maintenance of museums and civic centers and school auditoriums used for concerts . Now the states are moving in where they might well have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Arts Council supports traveling opera and ballet and exhibitions . Twenty-four other states have recently established similar programs : and now , the National Council on the Arts , at this writing distributing more wind than manna , penniless but proud . There is scarcely a kind of patronage ? private , ecclesiastical , aristocratic , corporate , governmental , or popular ? that has ever existed that does not exist in America today . This is a " golden age " of patronage by any standard . There are also those who argue that it is a golden age of architecture and of painting and sculpture . ( I have heard no one argue that it is a golden age of theater or music , though the dance is in full international bloom . ) There are also those who are appalled , some privately , some officially , some , one suspects venally , at the declining level of the public sensibilities , at the damage done to taste by commercialism and by the mass media that proliferate mass culture . There is nothing new about this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American painter Thomas Cole wrote in his diary : " There are few persons of real taste , and no opportunity for the true artist to develop his powers , The tide of utility sets against the fine arts . " The tide of utility , of course , has risen constantly since Cole 's day , but so also has our literacy , our support of cultural institutions , our external concern with the arts , and our patronage of the artist . Our concern , however , has become less personal and inure public and therefore it seems less passionate . We have come from the age of the drawing-room musicale by way of the recital hall to the age of the mammoth cultural center ; from the individually loved painting to the private collection to the massive museum ; from the individual patron to the local committee of art lovers to the corporate board and to the National Council on the Arts . And somewhere along the line , as the patronage and the money have vastly increased and the arts have become a matter of public policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion has been drowned out by the brouhaha of cultural fashion . The small voice , however . is never entirely stilled , nor the passionate believer ever diverted , and it will be he , not foundation panelists , who with the artist can change this era of unparalleled artistic prosperity from one of reckless cultural overkill to an age that may one day be called " golden .
