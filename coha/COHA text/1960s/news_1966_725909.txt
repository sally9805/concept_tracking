txt If the politicans had deliberately sought to mystify and intimidate New York 's voters , they could scarcely have done more than will be accomplished in normal . course by the ordeal of facing the voting machine tomorrow . Many entering the polling place and confronting the infinitely involved ballot can be forgiven if they experience a regressive yearning for the simplicities of a paper ballot and a stub pencil . New York State , with its overly detailed Constitution and complex laws , offers voters nothing simple . Thus , tomorrow those who are truly conscientious ? or just fiercely determined  --  can use both the machine and a paper ballot . Their range of responsibilities can reasonably be described as awesome . In Manhattan , for example , voters are expected to r vote for Governor and Lieutenant Governor , Controller , Attorney General , Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals , fifteen delegates at large to the Constitutional Convention and three district delegates , a Borough President , five justices of the Supreme Court , one Surrogate , four judges of the Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an Assemblyman . But voters can not quit at that point . They still must grapple with a proposition , eleven amendments to the State Constitution and a question relating to the City Charter . A " proposition , " in case you are in doubt , is a law that does not amend the Constitution but requires voter approval before it can take effect . The proposition on this year 's ballot asks approval of a $200-million bond issue for outdoor recreational facilities . The " question " relates to the Civilian Complaint Review Board . First to the intricacies of the machine . Upon entering the booth , the voter should pull the red handle at the lower left side of the machine as far as it will go . That draws the curtain and unlocks the machine . It is impossible to vote a straight party ticket by pulling a single lever . The voter has to turn the small lever next to the name of each candidate he prefers . When the small lever is pulled , an X appears in the small square under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed working . It is possible to vote for fifteen delegates at large to the Constitutional Convention by choosing one of the four party lines on Row 5 of the machine . But the voter who wishes to pick and choose among the delegate candidates of the different parties must ignore Row 5 . Instead , he tears off a slip with the names of his party 's delegates and draws a line through names he does not want . On the reverse side of the slip , the voter writes in the names of his other choices . Next , he moistens the gummed edge of the slip , presses a button at the upper left corner of the machine and opens the slide on the write-in slot in front of Row 5 . He inserts the slip , pressing the gummed edge to the paper roll inside the slot , and closes the little slide . This complicated procedure was obviously not designed to make ticket-splitting easier . The final step after all votes have been indicated is to pull the red handle on the machine to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote and clears the machine for the next voter .
