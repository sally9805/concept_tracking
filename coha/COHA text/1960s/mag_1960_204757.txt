WHEN the U.S. proclaimed that it has a defensive right to fly high in the sky above Communist territory , it entered into an area of international law as unexplored and uncertain as outer space itself . Says International Lawyer and Political Scientist Hans Morgenthau of the University of Chicago : " There are no legal precedents for such flights . " The U.S. now finds itself in a grey area between war and peace , in a time when old codes are frequently stretched or violated . In the past cold-war decade . Soviet or Red Chinese combat planes have attacked and gunned down half a dozen U.S. patrol planes , several of them well outside Communist borders . The cost : at least 28 U.S. lives . The penalty paid by the Soviets , despite U.S. protests to the World Court : none . In West Berlin , refugees are kidnaped by Communist agents and smuggled behind the Iron Curtain - beyond the reach of Western law . Considering these cold-war realities , does the U.S. have a legal or moral right to bend or break the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The nation 's ultimate position hinges on the answers to other questions : <P> Is espionage legal ? All countries have spies . International law holds spying legal and moral . But no international law protects a captured spy . He has no rights . Usual penalty for wartime spying death . <P> Are frontiers held inviolable ? Invasion of another state 's frontier is a well-established , old-fashioned breach of international law . <P> Do frontiers extend into the sky ? All nations agree that a country 's territorial rights extend above its land . But that agreement is fairly new-dating from World War I , when man began to appreciate the potential of the airplane as a weapon of combat and reconnaissance . <P> How high does sovereignty go ? Some legal experts contend that sovereignty ends with the last trace of oxygen-more than 600 miles up . Others note that the three-mile limit at sea was fixed by the range of oldtime land-based guns , figure that the same measure of " effective control " can be applied to the air . By that gauge , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without violating sovereignty , because so far as is known , no Soviet land-based rocket , missile or plane could touch it . <P> If the U.S. claims the right to fly over the U.S.S.R. , would it have to allow Soviet spy planes to fly over the U.S. ? The Russians would have a strong case . The State Department seeks to deflect it by reminders that President Eisenhower has been working toward an internationally recognized right of overflight in his " Open Skies " plan offered at the 1955 summit conference in Geneva . <P> Would U.S. defenders now fire upon any Soviet reconnaissance planes if they were caught over U.S. territory ? Yes , unless the pilot agreed to land and surrender himself and his craft .
