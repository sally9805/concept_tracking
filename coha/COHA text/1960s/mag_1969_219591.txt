It was almost worse than if God had died . Not very many people know God , after all . But saints are another story , often they are local boys who had made good . Thus when word came out of Rome last month that some saints had been dropped from a new liturgical calendar ( TIME , May 16 ) , both their devout followers and a surprising number of nondevout allies were outraged . The Vatican apparently viewed the new calendar as a routine liturgical change , hardly noticeable in an age of guitar Masses . But the Pope might just as well have issued an encyclical against baseball . <P> That Kind of Guy . Protestants , Catholics , Jews and even nonbelievers were suddenly making common cause on be half of sanctity . A mock-solemn committee of agnostics and believers descended on a local unemployment office in Los Angeles and picketed in favor of the " heavenly jobless . " A truck driver in Boston took his St. Christopher statue off the dashboard , had his first accident in 35 years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with headquarters in France reported that enrollments were climbing . Columnist Art Buchwald , a Jew , speculated that good old St. Chris topher would go right on protecting travelers , calendar or no , because he 's " that kind of guy . " <P> In Massachusetts , an anonymous worshiper at St. Barbara 's Church in Woburn began placing fresh flowers at the statue of the church 's demoted patron saint . A woman in a crowded Naples streetcar invoked the name of St. Januarius - the city 's patron - when the car suddenly stopped and slammed passengers together . A few seconds later , she changed her tone in disgust . " The devil with San Gennaro ! He 's no good any more . My poor saint ! " <P> Devotees of St. George and St. Nicholas were more solemnly perturbed . In London , Tory M.P . John Biggs-Davison , a Roman Catholic , wondered if " Anglicans and Orthodox were consulted , in the spirit of Christian unity . Cavalrymen laying their wreath at St. George 's statue , Scouts marching past the sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their patron , but they will think less kindly of Rome . " In Washington , D.C. , the Russian Orthodox community expressed its feelings by packing the church for a May feast day honoring St. Nicholas . Some Orthodox churchmen complained that Rome insulted their faith by unilaterally downgrading saints who were especially revered by Eastern Christianity . <P> Central Mysteries . Actually , Rome 's reform was an attempt to carry out one of the mandates of the Second Vatican Council : to update an antiquated liturgical calendar that was cluttered with unfamiliar , and in some cases probably fictional figures . Some of the updating consisted of replacing little-known early martyrs ( and no less than 17 early Popes ) with a wider sampling of countries and vocations : the newly included Uganda martyrs , * for instance , are among the calendar 's relatively few laymen . A more important reason : renewed emphasis through the liturgical year on the central mysteries of Christ 's life , passion and resurrection , rather than on the veneration of saints .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
