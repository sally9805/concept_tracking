Like the western , the international spy story usually falls into one of two categories : the Spoof or the Morality Play . A Dandy in Aspic offers a little of one and a lot of the other . The anti-hero has his moments of fun during a few idyllic interludes in the percales with some warm-blooded British birds ; the rest of the time he is trapped in a plot as inexorable as fate . <P> Haughty , dandified Eberlin ( Laurence Harvey ) is outwardly a London snob and secretly a top British agent . He is also a Russian assassin named Krasnevin who for 18 years has been knocking off other British agents as he knocks down a smashing double salary . Homesick , he begs his Red superiors to let him quit . Nyet : he must go on . And his job is getting tougher all the time . His British bosses have got wind of Krasnevin 's existence-though they do n't know what he looks like-and they want him expunged . As just the man for the job , Eberlin winds up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Berlin , when all he wearily wants to be is the spy who came in from the gold . <P> Aspic was almost as cursed as Eberlin . Director Anthony Mann died before it was finished and Laurence Harvey took over , maintaining the film 's tense , glossy style . But the Mann-Harvey combination could not quite cope with Aspic 's thin and often incoherent content . No one in the film is properly motivated ; nearly everyone is unremittingly evil . For the viewer , as for Eberlin , there is no one to trust . <P> As the haggard , laggard spy , Harvey is a stereotypical pawn of the politburo ; as his most persistent bedmate , Mia Farrow is a soft sprite whose eyes are larger than her role . The stars are outshone by the supporting players , including Tom Courtenay as a psychotic British agent and Per Oscarsson as his junkie Russian counterpart , hopelessly in love with the heroin . Fortunately , they give Aspic some flavor as it moves toward a credibly tragic end , when Harvey suspects the game is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a whore in a creaking bed . "
