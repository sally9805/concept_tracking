More and more people are arguing that if classical theater is to be presented with any frequency in the U.S. , it must be done at some remove from commercial Broadway . More and more people are doing something about it . From Minneapolis to Washington , San Francisco and Oklahoma City , the list of regional rep companies continues to grow . And in the city that Sir Thomas Beecham once called an " esthetic dustbin , " the Seattle Repertory Theater has just begun its debut season . <P> Permanent Resident . Directed by Stuart Vaughan , 38 , who ran Manhattan 's old Phoenix rep company for five seasons and earlier spent four as artistic director of Joseph Papp 's New York Shakespeare Festival , the Seattle company opened with a stern and deliberate production of Lear , followed a night later by a bizarre and romping turn with Max Frisch 's The Firebugs . The standard of selection , according to Vaughan , is " classics and could-be classics . " The remainder of the season will see productions of Anton Chekhov 's The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burning , and Robert Ardrey 's Shadow of Heroes . The theater is housed in the white brick and thermopane 800-seat Seattle Center Playhouse built for last year 's World 's Fair . And people can still whisk out there from downtown , if they like , by monorail . <P> More than 500 actors tried to get into the group . Vaughan picked 15 , including his wife , Helen Quarrier ; none are of star rank but all are experienced . " Most of us are making sacrifices to come here , " he says . " Our salaries are certainly not high . But I think we all felt the same motivation to try something better . " He hopes to stay in Seattle the rest of his life . <P> Promising Dust . If the new eastern Lincoln Center rep group under Elia Kazan becomes a living monument to The Method , it will at least have a counterbalance on the Pacific Coast . Stuart Vaughan has no fondness for The Method . " It seems to me that nothing exists for the audience if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far from living the part , the actor 's function is to tell the audience about an imaginary person who looks and talks and feels like this . I hope the main difference an audience will see in our plays is that they seem more real than others . " <P> The advance subscription sale exceeds $150,000 . Seattle businessmen are standing behind the rep company because , profitable or not , they think it will be good for Seattle : " It can become another asset , " they say almost in chorus , " like Mount Rainier.
