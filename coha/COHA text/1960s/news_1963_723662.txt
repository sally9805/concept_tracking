txt President Johnson challenged Congress today to restore an $800 million cut in foreign aid funds by the House Appropriations committee . He contended that the reduction would force the United States " to follow policies of weakness and retreat . " The President said in a statement from the White House that the $2.8 billion appropriation brought out by the committee earlier in the day " would put our foreign policy in a straitjacket . " He said that it would undermine the Alliance for Progress , oblige this Government to dishonor its commitments and undermine United States efforts to make the Soviet Union and . others live up to their pledges to the United Nations . " I can not believe that the Congress intends to require the United States of America to follow policies of weakness and retreat . I urge the Congress , therefore , to appropriate the funds essential to conduct strong and forward-looking foreign assistance programs in the United States national interest , " Mr. Johnson said in his statement . Wants Full Amount " The drastic reduction in aid funds proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe setback to American leadership and to United States interests in many parts of the world , " the President said . The $2.8 billion recommended to the House is $1.7 below the figure requested by President Kennedy . The President did not specify how much of the $800 million under the authorized ceiling he wanted put back in the appropriation . However , foreign aid officials who assisted in the preparation of his statement said they understood him to be seeking restoration of the full amount or as much of it as the Democratic leadership could successfully demand . House Democratic leaders were taken by surprise by the timing and vigor of the President 's statement . An hour be- , fore it was issued they had understood that there would be no fight on the House floor to restore all or part of the committee cut . " This changes everything , " one member of the leadership said when the President 's statement was read to him . " It assures a strong effort on the floor to put back part of the money . " Underlying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been reached between Speaker John J. McCormack and Representative Otto E. Passman , chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee . Mr. Passman 's recommendations were endorsed earlier today , when the Appropriations Cora-1 mittee voted to report out the bill , According to this understanding , Mr. Passman had agreed to increase his recommendations on new foreign aid money from $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion with a promised further increase of 8200 million when the measure was sent ultimately to conference with the Senate . There is little doubt that Mr. Passman had the votes in his subcommittee to cut the bill to $2.4 billion . He was also assured of the parent committee 's endorsement of whatever amount he proposed . Since Mr. Passman 's bill included $209 million more of reapportioned funds , the Speaker wes understood to have felt justified in pledging that there would be no floor fight . The President did not deal in his statement with the amounts voted by the Appropriations Committee for various categories of aid . But he pulled no punches in describing the effect of the committee cuts on the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alliance for Progress with LatinAmerican countries would mean , the President said , that " The United States would be providing for all of Latin America less than the Soviet Union is putting into Cuba alone . " He added : " This is no way to combat a Communism in Latin America ! " The $525 million authorized for the Alliance was cut $95 million by the committee . President Kennedy had asked for $650 . The President described as a startling proposal the committee 's recommendation cutting United States voluntary contributions to international organizations like the United Nations Special Fund by $36 million to total of $100 million .
