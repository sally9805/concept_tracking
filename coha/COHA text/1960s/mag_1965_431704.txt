 | The five immovable objects stood fast @# Not since the days of cowboys and Indians ? or hors thieves and posses , anyway ? had the West had such a nice basic conflict . It was not , unfortunately , bad guys and good guys ? the terms being statistical rather than moral ? but there was never a more dramatic confrontation . Coming out of Provo , Utah was Brigham Young , for most of the season the nation 's No. 1 offensive team , headed for Albuquerque , home of the New Mexico Lobos , the nation 's best defensive team . Any fan in Albuquerque who went the whole week without once using the expressions " irresistible force " and " immovable object " was clearly tortured by restraint . It may indeed have been the classic basketball face-off . Because the teams happened to be the two best in what may suddenly become the best conference , none of the game 's luster was lost when Miami ( Fla. ) coincidentally scored 141 points against somebody not even listed in the NCAA Guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it turned out , the Cougars we . have slid back to second anyway . cause the Lobos held them to 70 poin scored 89 on their own and thus me ' into first place in the Western Athle : Conference . It would be very neat to wrap it up in ribbons as a victory for defer over offense , but it was really rebour ing that won for New Mexico . Such fuss had been made about the Lobos , allowing only 48 points a game that had been almost forgotten they v also second in the country in rebounding . The New Mexico defense was standing ? particularly in keeping BYU 's high-scoring John Fairchild from gett the ball inside ? but it was on the board that the Lobos were toughest , outrebounding the visitors 41-22 . The battle was certainly joined in the ' spirit of the occasion , though . Each team went with its strength , a fact that was strongly suggested at practice the day before the game .

Then Coach Star Watts came on with the Cougars , who. in their fashion , concentrated on fa : breaks . It was a wasted practice , though . for the next night Brigham Young just could not get the ball often enough to make the break work . Counting liberally , the Cougars got off five breaks , and scored on only one of them . New Mexico scored once on a break ? which it does about as regularly as the U.S. makes the Gadsden Purchase . With the squad 's only senior , an intense an , . emotional little guard named Skip Kruzich , running the team , New Mexico most of the time plays a deliberate game that often means passing up shots from as close as the free-throw line . Perhaps because there never was any worthwhile basketball in New Mexico before , the fans are not disappointed by this . They @#  | screamed , " Slow it down , " and expressed genuine displeasure when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ease against Brigham Young . that was upsetting the fans was that scoring by New Mexico meant that Brighamm Young could get the ball and also score . Johnson Gymnasium was one loud groan when the Cougars hit 70 ? meaningless though the figure was . " When you 're No . I in defense , " Skip Kruzich says , " you develop pride in that side of the game fast enough . " Everyone at New Mexico is on the defense . The University of New Mexico is in Albuquerque because , the story goes , Santa Fe , the state capital , had a choice and decided it would rather have the state pen than the state university . Albuquerque , at the foot of the Sandia Mountains , is one of the fastest-growing and sunniest cities in America . By actual count , according to the front page of the afternoon newspaper , the sun has now shone on Albuquerque on 1,154 of the last 1,156 days , and that was wonderfullv reassuring knowledge to bask in last ? seek when the temperature seldom rose over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oblong . It follows Route 66 for almost as long as those two guys in the sports car on TV . Route 66 runs for almost 20 miles within the city limits , with both sides banked almost entirely by gas stations , motels and restaurants that give hamburgers fancy names . If you like hamburgers and free TV in every room , you can get your kicks on Route 66 . Gratefully , this neon dedication to the garish is interrupted by the university campus , which is all done in Pueblo style . Johnson Gymnasium ( basketball capacity 6,457 ) is also in this style , despite its size . Johnson faces right on 66 , with a statue of a lobo in front of it . This is probably the only lobo that any one at UNM has ever seen , since this breed of wolf ? and , indeed , all wolves ? has long since left the state . For a live mascot the university has to make do with a tough-looking Alaskan husky that masquerades as a lobo . The husky-lobo attends football games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it gets too excited around the court .

The overall strength in the conference is illustrated by the fact that , before last week 's games eased things a bit , four teams were virtually tied for first place . Then New Mexico moved to the top alone when it beat Brigham Young after Brigham Young had beaten Wyoming and Arizona State beat Arizona . On Thursday , Wyoming had given the Cougars a real fight before bowing , just as Utah was doing with the Lobos . Both games went to the final buzzer . In Laramie , BYU Guard Mike Gardner won the game 96 ? 94 with a last-second layup . In Albuquerque , the home folks felt called upon to bombard the court once with trash , but at least they went home winners when New Mexico sophomore Bill Morgan threw in a jumper with seven seconds left in the overtime period TRIFLE-TEAMED Utah player is cornered by New Mexico defense tactic that forces errors . to end it 65-64 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game at the buzzer with one of his line-drive jump shots from near the free-throw line . He was fouled in the act but missed what would have been the winning point when his free throw first hit the back rim , then the front one , before bouncing out . Poor Chambers missed another foul with 18 seconds left in the overtime , and that led to New Mexico getting the ball back and to Morgan making the winning shot . New Mexico 's effort against Utah was as poor as any the team had shown this year , but the Lobos can be excused a few odd nights since , remarkably , three of the starters are sophomores . But King 's sophomores ? Morgan , Monroe and 6-foot-9 Mel Daniels ? have caught on amazingly fast . It is these three , together with junior Dick ( Boo ) Ellis , who rattle the backboards so thoroughly . continued 57  | ( Ellis is a nephew of the original Boo Ellis from Niagara and the pros . This Boo Ellis is New Mexico 's , and possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all four crashing the boards , King admits that his team is vulnerable to fast breaks , but so far no one has been able to get the ball in the first place against the Lobos . BYU 's Cougars rebounded so poorly that Fairchild , who was averaging better than 11 a game , was able to snare only six , and that took care of BYU 's fast-break game . In trying to force its own fast-break tempo on the game , BYU also planned to upset New Mexico 's methodical pace by pressuring its source , Kruzich . " This New Mexico kind of offense , " said BYU Assistant Pete Witbeck before the game , " relies on the type of smart boy that Kruzich is . If we can force him , we may change their whole style . " Coach Watts assigned his best defensive player , Guard Dick Nemelka , to handle Kruzich , and the plan worked at first . Nemelka drove Kruzich constantly to the left and so harassed him ? New Mexico style ? in straight one-on-one situations that he stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nowhere near as stringent , and eventually Kruzich was able to move the ball in . " Nemelka was good . He 's real tough , " Kruzich said afterward , " but the rest of them did n't seem to care too much for defense . I could see Daniels in there , feeling Fairchild on him and then simply rolling the other way . Mel would just stick a hand up then , and it was easy to spot him the ball . " Fairchild did not seem to enjoy the multitude of Lobos underneath . Early in the game he sank five beautiful baskets within a period of less than three minutes to bring Brigham Young from behind at 10-13 to ahead 21-17 . But as sparkling as he was offensively during this stretch , he twice fouled Daniels and twice let him make baskets , so that New Mexico stayed in the game . Morgan , who was guarding Fairchild , suddenly got meaner on defense , and from then on the Cougars ' graceful big man got only six more shots and made only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' big men , Daniels and Morgan , had no trouble getting the ball . Daniels , who was guarded by Fairchild , led everyone with 25 points and 11 rebounds . The Lobos made 36 baskets , and 21 of them were simple layups or tap-ins . Brigham Young held on into the second half , mostly because of good shooting . The Cougars made 17 of 35 shots in the first 22 minutes , and then caved in . The rest of the way they were seven for 26 . " That 's the way a good defensive team will do it to you , " Watts said afterward . " They 'll get you out of your pattern , and then you start taking the really bad shots . " Shaking New Mexico is a bit more difficult . Only once all last year , in the finals of the National Invitational Tournament , were the Lobos really beaten ? Bradley swamped them 86-54 . " You know how we caught on on this campus ? " Kruzich asked . " Nobody even talks about that game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all figure we had 28 good games , so we had one bad one coming . They do n't talk about that game . But we really want to go back to New York . We got there last year and we were walking around and people said , Oh , New Mexico . You play basketball out there ? ' Well , we showed them . We even got to be everybody 's favorite . Oh man , do we want to go back to that NIT ! You know what it is , a lot of it ? Dick and me , we 're the only ones who started on that team , and the other guys , the sophomores , all they hear about is that great New Mexico team of last year . But it does n't mean much , because they were n't a part of it . You know what they want ? They want to overcome that team . And Dick and I are all for that . We 're on this team now . We 'd like to be remembered for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team beats a couple of rinky-dinks , the students start screaming : " We 're No. 1 . " At New Mexico , where all this winning is new , the cheer is a modest " We want in ? the top 10 . " Which is very reasonable . The night before the Brigham Young game , a fraternity held New Mexico 's very first basketball rally . It was well advertised and complete with a Cougar effigy that was burned , but still only about 50 people showed up and a lot of them were hanging around the frat house anyway . Kruzich dropped by because his girl , Sandra Marshall , is head of the Chaparrals , the girl cheerleaders . He looked around at the slim gathering . " I guess it 's just hard to get traditions so quickly , " he said , " when you 've only been having champions for a couple of years . "
