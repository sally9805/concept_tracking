THE DOCTORS by Martin L. Gross . 605 pages . Random House . $6.95 . <P> The U.S. physician is " a man of mediocre intellect , trade-school mentality , limited interests and incomplete personality . " He has trouble diagnosing a boil . Scalpel in hand , he needlessly whacks off the nearest tonsil ; absentmindedly , he seals sponges , forceps , suture needles , thread , scissors and drainage tubes into surgical wounds . He takes pharmaceutical lessons from drug salesmen and writes illegible prescriptions that kill his patients . He soaks the sick , cheats on his income tax and , on his inviolable Wednesday afternoons at the country club , devotedly chases par while his patients perish unattended in hospitals , as often as not from falling out of bed . <P> This savage indictment of U.S. medical practice forms the theme of The Doctors , a book probably headed for bestsellerdom . Its message seems to be that the ailing human being should keep his malaise a secret from the medical profession ; otherwise , the doctor will surely blunder , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careless hospital will expose him to infection and , if none of these death agents succeed , some nurse will administer a fatally inaccurate prescription . <P> The Gap . The Doctors is a prime example of a respectable purpose spoiled by demagoguery . Doctors themselves no longer deny the need of putting their house in order ; the more conscientious have begun to re-examine the gap between contemporary medicine and the Hippocratic oath . Where this book rests on statistics , it effectively states its case : a falling life expectancy in U.S. males , an infant-mortality rate that ranks eleventh in the roster of civilized nations ( behind even Czechoslovakia ) , a medical educational establishment that not only fails to meet the numerical need but sometimes licenses inferior and undedicated men . <P> <P> Gross , however , has elected to aim his book at human passions , at all the unfortunate sick who have been kept waiting in the reception room , who fell athwart the doctor 's inhumane side - or thought they did-who are all too ready to believe that the surgeon 's main purpose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That side of medicine unfortunately exists . It is the only side revealed in this book . <P> Two Assumptions . It is possible that Gross , a freelance writer whose first book , The Brain Watchers , prompted a congressional inquiry into nosy psychological testing techniques , is genuinely interested in sparking a similar inquiry into the medical profession . It is even conceivable that such a thoughtless , careless and incendiary book as this , produced by a layman whose narrative style is not exactly what the doctor ordered ( " Major medical policies do not blanketly cover the patient " ) , will accomplish a worthy end . <P> That possibility rests on two invalid assumptions . The first is that the medical profession is dominated by money-grabbing scoundrels who will never let the profession heal itself . The second is that the way to repair it is to infuriate patients into action by painting all doctors as evil , incompetent and greedy men .
