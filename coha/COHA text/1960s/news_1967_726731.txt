txt A three-man mediation panel to try to settle the transit con tract dispute without a strike ! on Jan. 1 will be announced by Mayor Lindsay next week . It was learned last night that Mr. Lindsay would name Theodore W. Kheel , Joseph E. O'Grady and Vincent J. as the mediators . Mr. Kheel , a noted labor mediator , has served on several mediation panels in previous contract negotiations between the Transit Authority and the Transport Workers Union . Mr. O'Grady was the chairman of the authority when he retired last year . He had served as a member of the three-man authority since 1955 , except for a brief period between 1962 and 1963 when he was appointed a Criminal Court judge by Mayor Robert F. Wagner . He returned as chairman in 1963 . Mr. O'Donnell is chairman of the State Mediation Board . He was appointed to the board by Governor Rockefeller in 1962 and made chairman in 1963 . The Mayor decided to name the three mediators after he was informed by both the Transit Authority and the Transport Workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Kheel and Mr. O'Grady are Democrats , and were intimates of former Mayor Wagner and his close advisors . Mr. Lindsay is a Republican . During the contract negotiations that preceded the 12-day transit strike in January , 1966 , Mr. Lindsay 's relations with both Mr. Kheel and Mr. O'Grady had been cool . He has been friendly with Mr. , a Republican , and has used his services in several recent labor disputes with municipal unions . Mr. Lindsay had declined to name Mr. Kheel as a mediator in 1965 . He acceded , however , when Michael J. Quill , the late president of the T.W.U. , threatened to strike unless Mr. Kheel was chosen as one of the three mediators who eventually served in the dispute . The Mayor has conferred in recent months with Mr. Kheel , Mr. O'Grady and Mr. about their availability to serve in the present crucial negotiations . They had indicated willingness to take the assignments . Mr. Kheel had made it clear , however , that he would serve only if the mediators were given authority to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was opposed to any requirement that recommendations be made on a specified date . Such a requirement is in the state 's so-called Taylor Law , which recently replaced the Condon-Wadlin Law . It is believed that Mr. Lindsay has agreed to ' the conditions outlined by Mr. Kheel . The naming of the three mediators comes at a time when the authority and the union appear to be far apart on their contract positions . The authority asserted Monday that the union 's demand for a 30 per cent across-the-board pay increase and other contract improvements would cost $1.1-billion over a two-year period and make it necessary to raise the present 20-cent fare to 60 cents . At a news conference yesterday in City Hall , the Mayor said that the 20-cent fare would be maintained regardless of the outcome of the contract negotiations . The T.W.U. has not made a strike threat , but its members have traditionally not worked without a contract . The present agreement ends Dec. 31.                    @
