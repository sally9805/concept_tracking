txt President Johnson 's message on the needs of the cities is a comprehensive but essentially conservative document . It seeks to improve and build upon existing programs . Though it contains much that has solid merit , the message is , perhaps inevitably , an inadequate statement . The most highly publicized part of the program is probably the least important . That is the President 's proclaimed objective of replacing six million units of substandard housing over the next ten years . Until local governments can crack the problem of finding land in urban areas on which to build public housing and until they can resolve the political problems in selecting sites for such housing , this goal is hardly likely to be attained . Some promising avenues of attack on the problem of housing for the poor do exist , and Mr. Johnson usefully discusses them . But even if this Congress would appropriate the funds that Mr. Johnson requests ? and that is not likely ? no one of these avenues or all of them would lead to a housing utopia . The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of public housing and has led to faster construction and better design . The rent subsidy program also enlists private builders and makes it possible to scatter low-income tenants rather than institutionalize them in vast projects . The new towns program , if energetically carried out , would diminish the population densities in the slums and , ease housing pressures in the older cities . For families in the $4,000 to $8,000 income bracket whose incomes are too high for public housing but too low in many cities to afford ordinary housing , the 221 D-3 program has proved workable , but the nonprofit sponsors of these projects have sometimes been victimized by promoters . Mr. Johnson recommends increased technical assistance for such sponsors . Still another approach that will help families in this same income bracket is the home ownership plan worked out by Senators Percy and Mondale and now endorsed by the President .

As he has in the past , the President again fully recognizes that the slums are a problem of human as well as physical rehabilitation . He urges Congress to appropriate somewhat larger . sums for the antipoverty program and for the model cities program which links improved health and education with new housing for rundown neighborhoods . Yet for all the good things in it , the message is an unambitious status quo statement . It is not a program really put together to confront a crisis . What is needed is what the mathematicians call a quantum leap : A national migration policy to direct the flow of people which now eddies haphazardly from rural backwater to city slum ; a national land policy to plan the development of future suburbs and new towns ; a national housing policy with much tougher controls over land speculators and featherbedding construction unions . The recommendations in this message point helpfully in the right direction , but until the nation 's leadership faces up to the dimensions of the urban crisis , the complex of housing-land-city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
