txt Britain will keep a close eye on the ruling Rhodesia Front 's congress at the end of the month . The meeting may offer some indication of how Rhodesia feels about its future relationship with Britain . It also will show what the mood is at the party level . The congress might also offer some pointers as to the progress of the hitherto secret exchanges between Salisbury and Whitehall on a possible settlement between the two countries . Even if Rhodesia 's Premier Ian Smith remains silent , the rank and file are likely to speak up on the issue . Rhodesia currently has three courses open to it : It can retain the status quo ; it can come to an agreement with Britain ( Pre'mier Smith considers this the best way to get " over the hump " ) ; or it can declare itself a republic . A constitutional committee set up recently is ready to recommend the republic approach . Get ready for the launching of the world 's largest hovercraft . Within the next few weeks the fourengined SRN 4 will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the English Channel next spring . . The new hovercraft will carry 35 cars and 255 ' passengers , or 550 passengers without cars . It costs ? 1,500,000 ( $4,200,000 ) . Hovering with the SRN 4 is a large slice of the future development of the burgeoning industry . Already four orders for the new craft have come from companies operating passenger hovercraft services in Britain . Officials say prospective overseas buyers are holding off any decisions until the craft starts its commercial runs . But interest in the development of the new vessel is said to be running high . And next spring , say hovercraft enthusiasts , the giant craft 's potentials will be obvious ? and orders for it hopefully will soar . Trends . Political pots are boiling in Britain . The Labor Party convenes in Scarborough , Yorkshire , Oct. 2 to 6 . Its mood will be critical and uneasy . Later in the month the Tories meet at Brighton . These follow closely on the heels of two hard-fought by-elections ( special elections ) in which the Labor government received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by young revolutionaries . A common thread in all three conferences : challenges from " the floor " to the party leadership . Jeremy Thorpe , while demonstrably the leader , did not dominate the liberal meeting . He was applauded but not cheered . Harold Wilson , by common consent the outstanding figure in his party and a consummate political performer , meets mounting criticism . His way of defending the pound sterling has led to growing unemployment . And Edward Heath , though without a rival as leader of the Conservatives , has failed to acquire a large and aroused popular following . At the grassroots level , a national concensus about what direction a government should take seems to be surfacing . None of the party leaders have yet been able to grasp it  --  although all three are straining to do so . Britons are mystified at the behavior of the London stock market . Unemployment is up again . Production is below last year 's level . Some of the auto industry workers remain on short time ; some of the industry is stopped by strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly the market haS jumped to an all-time high . It could be a false boom . One explanation : There is a shortage of stocks and shares as the government takes Aver more and more of the country 's busiless . Meanwhile , insurance companies , pension funds , and banks are bulging with money  --  and already overburdened with fixed-interest government bonds . More noney chases fewer industrial stocks ; so , ip go prices . How and why . . . Londoners are about to get a new look at , ondon . The government is trebling its future pending on cleaning London 's historic tuildings . Already the great cathedral of St. Paul 's , lesigned by Wren , is being uncovered as glorious , almost golden sight . Even Londoners are unaware of the full eauty of their city , say the renovators . Soon the great churches , historic govern-lent buildings , galleries , and bridges may ave as many residents stopping for second asks as they have tourists .                @ @ @ @ @
