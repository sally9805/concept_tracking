Uta Hagen comes on swearing . In three hours , she weeps , snarls , rages at her husband , expounds a boozy philosophy , talks baby talk , goes off to the kitchen to seduce a casual visitor , and turns in a performance that stains the memory but stays there . The play is Edward Albee 's Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? , a psychological Grand Guignol set in the academic world , and last week , for her portrayal of Martha , a professor 's rough-edged wife , Uta Hagen won the Antoinette Perry Award for the year 's best performance by an actress . <P> With auburn hair , a strong frame and a forbiddingly experienced face , Uta Hagen has the physical force to play Albee 's tough , bitter , foul-mouthed woman . There are , in fact , some superficial similarities between the actress and the character she plays , and her friends kid her about them . <P> Groves of Academe . Albee 's Martha is the twice-married daughter of the founder and president of a college . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emigrated to the U.S. and founded the art history department at the University of Wisconsin . Her language is sometimes as strong as Martha 's . Albee 's Martha talks baby talk . When she wants a drink , she says she is firsty . Uta Hagen has a similar idiosyncrasy . Coffee , on her tongue , becomes tossie . <P> But there the similarities end . Martha , the woman on the stage , has made a fatal wreckage of her life . Uta Hagen has made hers an accomplishment . After a year at London 's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art , she made her debut as an Ophelia considerably taller than Hamlet , who was played , oddly enough , by Eva Le Gallienne . She became a memorable Desdemona and a fine St. Joan . She followed Jessica Tandy as Tennessee Williams ' Blanche DuBois with a performance so good that it was generally conceded to be the better of the two . She won another Tony award as the relentlessly dowdy wife of a fading star in Clifford Odets ' Country Girl . <P> Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a scene in which she wore boxing gloves and was supposed to hang one on the leading man . This leading man had a nose like Cyrano de Bergerac 's and was not much bigger than Toulouse-Lautrec . Uta flattened him . He got up and , some months later , married her ; she became Mrs. Jos Ferrer . <P> They did Othello together with Negro Actor Paul Robeson . Traveling from city to city , the Ferrers decided to stay in no hotel that would refuse Robeson . They were all quite close . And as Robeson veered more and more loudly to the left and Moscow , this closeness got the Ferrers into trouble . In due course they were called to Washington to explain their political beliefs . Ferrer , who had just won an Oscar for Cyrano , denied any leftist leanings and was not blacklisted . Uta was dismissed without being heard at all . She ended up on TV and Hollywood blacklists nonetheless . She has never made a movie . <P> Right Idea . Divorced from Ferrer in 1948 , Uta later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The Andersonmlle Trial , Krapp 's Last Tape ) , Berghof is equally appreciated within his profession as a teacher . With Uta he runs the Herbert Berghof Studio in Greenwich Village , an acting school with a student body of 900 and a roster of celebrated alumni like Geraldine Page and Fritz Weaver .
