Malcolm X had been a pimp , a cocaine addict and a thief . He was an unashamed demagogue . His gospel was hatred : " Your little babies will get polio ! " he cried to the " white devils . " His creed was violence : " If ballots wo n't work , bullets will . " <P> Yet even before his bullet-ripped body went to its grave , Malcolm X was being sanctified . Negro leaders called him " brilliant , " said he had recently " moderated " his views , blamed his assassination on " the white power structure " or , in the case of Martin Luther King , on a " society sick enough to express dissent with murder . " Malcolm 's death , they agreed , was a setback to the civil rights movement . <P> Alias John Doe . In fact , Malcolm X - in life and in death-was a disaster to the civil rights movement . <P> Malcolm 's murder , almost certainly at the hands of the Black Muslims from whom he had defected , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroes in the Audubon Ballroom , a seedy two-story building on Manhattan 's upper Broadway . Characteristically , he had kept his followers waiting for nearly an hour while he lingered over tea and a banana split at a nearby Harlem restaurant . <P> Entering the auditorium at last , Malcolm cried " As-salaam alaikum Peace be unto you . " The audience replied in unison : " Wa-alaikum salaam And unto you be peace . " Suddenly a disturbance broke out several rows back . " Get your hand off my pockets ! " a man shouted . " Do n't be messing with my pockets ! " At the distraction , Malcolm raised his hands . " Now brothers ! " he cried , " Be cool , do n't get excited . . . " <P> As he spoke , three men rushed down the aisle toward him . Eight feet away , they opened fire . One Negro with a double-barreled sawed-off shotgun blasted Malcolm at point-blank range . " There was what sounded like an explosion , " said a dazed woman . " I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his goatee . " Men and women threw themselves to the floor as the gunmen squeezed off at least a score of shots . Thirteen shotgun pellets tore into Malcolm 's chest and heart ; several slugs from .45-and .38-cal. pistols shattered his thighs and legs . A woman screamed : " Oh , black folks , black folks , why you got to kill each other ? " <P> The man with the shotgun was hit in the left leg by a bullet from the pistol of a Malcolm X bodyguard . Crippled , he was caught by Malcolm X 's furious followers , knocked down , kicked and stomped on . Cops rescued him , took him to a hospital , and charged him with homicide . He was Thomas Hagan , alias Talmadge Hayer , a New Jersey thug with a dreary police record . <P> Minutes after the shooting , Malcolm 's body was lifted from the stage , placed on a rolling bed that had been wheeled over from the nearby Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center , and rushed to an emergency operating room . A team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him via open-heart massage . But Malcolm X was dead . Because he had not yet been formally identified , he was at first entered on hospital records as John Doe .
