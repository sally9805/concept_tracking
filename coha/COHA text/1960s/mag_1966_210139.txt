It was only a matter of time before Asia 's richest industrial power tried to accomplish by friendly persuasion what it had failed to win in war : economic dominance of a huge region . Last week , amid toasts in French champagne to Oriental solidarity , Japan made its boldest move in economic diplomacy in 30 years . It invited nine Southeast Asian nations to its first postwar trade-and-aid conference and , to general surprise , minister-level delegations came from eight-Cambodia , Indonesia , Laos , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , South Viet Nam and Thailand . While many guests still held grudges against Japan , the mood was summed up by Malaysia 's Foreign Minister Lim Kim San : " Bad memories die hard , but the fact that eight Asian nations have responded is proof that they are more concerned about the future than the past . " <P> In other words , they wanted to know what Japan would give them . Before anybody could say " Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere , " the Japanese were dangling goodies . Premier Eisaku @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation and communications , ports and harbors . Specifically , the Japanese said they would increase what they loosely call economic aid-including war reparations , long-term credits , private investments and government grants-from $350 million in fiscal 1965 to $870 million in fiscal 1968 , mostly for Southeast Asia . Naturally , Japan hopes that such pump-priming will expand its private business in the region , which is the second-largest market ( after the U.S. ) for Japanese goods and services . <P> The market is rapidly growing . Japanese teams are making surveys for a power project in Thailand , a harbor in Cambodia , fertilizer plants in the Philippines , Indonesia and Malaysia , and numerous other industries in the area . They are also surveying and likely to win some multimillion-dollar construction contracts in the Mekong River development project in Viet Nam , Thailand , Laos and Cambodia . Throughout Southeast Asia , Japanese businessmen and local entrepreneurs have set up 35 joint companies , including steel mills , auto-assembly plants , transistor-radio factories and big iron , copper , bauxite and nickel mines .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
