The plane that gets you there before you left EARLY this spring President Lyndon Johnson is expected to make a decision on an extraordinarily complex question involving nothing less than the future of America 's aircraft and airline industries , the nation 's balance of trade , its international scientific prestige , and the spending of billions of dollars in federal and private funds . The question the President will decide is how , if at all , the United States should continue its program lo build a commercial supersonic transport , the revolutionary plane known as the SST . If the program goes forward , the SST would go into service sometime during the mid-1970 's . Flying at speeds up to 2,000 mph  --  compared to about 600 for today 's jet liners  --  it would create its own dimension of time . Should a business executive in Paris , for example , decide to look in on his company 's office in Honolulu , he could take off at nine A.M. , breakfast en route and land in New York at seven A.M. An hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there at seven , he could have some coffee , stretch his legs and then depart al eight o'clock for Hawaii , reaching his destination at eight that same morning ( local time ) , an hour earlier than he left Paris  --  although his watch , still set to Paris time , would read six P.M. . , SUPERSONIC TRANSPORT " Who wants to fly that fast ? " Kentucky 's Sen. Thruston Morton asked when he heard about the SST 's speed . The answer is : plenty of people . The airlines have always bought the fastest planes available for the simple reason that the most speed sells the most seats . Lockheed bitterly recalls that an airline once turned down its Constellation in favor of the Douglas DC-7 in part because the airline 's studies showed that the DC-7 would make the New York-Miami run at an average of three minutes faster than the Connie . A survey taken for three airlines has shown that 90 percent of the passengers on today 's jets would fly on the SST , and 50 percent of these would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one great problem with a transport that flies so fast it gets there before it leaves : It is enormously expensive , so expensive that the SST 's critics claim the gain is not worth the price . No one has any real idea what a production-model SST would cost . but the best guess puts the figure at around $30 million  --  more than four times the price of the latest Boeing 707 . The thought of buying a fleet of SST 's makes airline executives shudder . " Some days , " says Charles C. Tillinghast Jr. , president of TWA , " I 'd like to pretend they are nothing but a bad dream . " The Government estimates , moreover , that just to develop the aircraft would cost one billion dollars  --  and some officials in the Administrationthink the figure would go far higher . Since the aircraft and engine manufacturers do n't have that kind of money , the Federal Government would have to put up most of the cash . Wisconsin 's Democratic Sen. William Proxmire has charged that the Government 's involvement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taxpayer funds , roughly comparable to throwing money to the four winds . " But the aircraft 's proponents argue that there are overriding reasons for developing an SST . There is , of course , the saving of time , the main reason for the plane 's existence in the first place . Lockheed , one of the companies interested in building the aircraft , has calculated that a California businessman who made five transcontinental round trips a year would save over 35 hours by flying in an SST instead of a present-day jet . If he made five round trips to Europe , the saving would add up to 70 hours , or about two work weeks . But the nation would benefit even more than the passenger , the plane 's advocates say . The work involved in building a fleet of SST 's , subcontracted out to dozens of companies , would provide jobs for nearly 50,000 men for years to come . What is more . they argue , the SST would lift the level of technology of the entire aeronautical industry , an industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely more and more upon missiles in-stead of new aircraft for ts defenses . Even apart from these considerations , however , backers of the SST claim that the United States really has no choice in the matter . It most develop the aircraft , because the British and French are already at work on a joint plan to build a supersonic transport of their own , the Concorde . Despite recent design problems and signs of British hesitations , the Concorde is several jumps ahead of an American SST . It is already in the wooden mock-upstage , and a prototype is expected to take the air around 1968 , with commercial flights to start about four years later . U.S. failure to produce a plane superior to the Concorde would seriously threaten America 's present domination of the world 's airways . About 75 percent of all the jets now flown by all the airlines of the world are made in the United States . In the last six years alone , foreign airlines have bought about $1.3 billion worth of American transports , contributing to this country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American SST , the Concorde would shift that balance : during the 1970 's American airlines would probably spend well over one billion dollars abroad for Concordes . If the United States builds a successful SST. on the other hand , a total of between $2.7 billion and $5 billion is expected to flow into the country , as the world continues to buy American . Although federal research on the SST began in 1956 , the program limped along until November , 1962 , when Britain and France signed their agreement to build the Concorde . This act jolted the Administration out of its lethargy and aroused the competitive instincts of John Kennedy . " The President felt we were being challenged at our own game on our own field , " says Najeeb Halaby. administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency . In February , 1963 , Kennedy asked Vice President Johnson to initiate a series of studies on the SST . Johnson . who soon became a firm advocate of the SST , formed a special committee of such top men in the Government as Defense Secretary Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webb , and Halaby . On May 30 , 1963. the council recommended to the President that the United States develop the aircraft . The task of directing the federal program was given to Halaby , and Halaby set up a special SST task force under the direction of Gordon Bain , a veteran of nine years in federal aviation agencies and a onetime airline executive . In the summer of 1963 , Bain set out to see whether any manufacturers were interested in making the SST . As an incentive , the Government offered to pay 75 percent of the estimated development costs . Although they have not agreed to this split , three airframe companies  --  North American , Boeing and Lockheed  --  submitted proposals in January , 1964 , but Bain 's group decided that all three aircraft would have been far too expensive to operate . " We did n't see a transport in those first designs , " Bain says , " but then we did n't expect to . We saw plans that were capable of refinement . " President Johnson eliminated North American 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try again . He also told Pratt &; Whitney and General Electric to go ahead with their engine proposals , rejecting the submission made by Curtiss-Wright . On November 1 , 1964 , the four companies resubmitted their proposals to the FAA , where they were studied for a month by Bain and a group of experts including men borrowed from NASA , the Civil Aeronautics Board , the Air Force and the Navy . Bain 's recommendation , still secret , was made to Halaby , and Halaby 's , also still secret , to a special reviewing committee set up by President Johnson last spring and chaired by Secretary McNamara . When the McNamara committee makes its recommendations . President Johnson will have a number of choices open to him . He can kill the SST program entirely . He can designate one or both airframe designs to be carried forward into prototypes . Or he can order another period of design improvement . The basic problem that Lockheed and Boeing have tried to solve with the proposals now before the Administration is. of course , to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense the Concorde 's designers have helped them in this . To capture the SST market , the French and British engineers decided to aim for an airplane costing only $10 million , and one that could be made available to the airlines relatively quickly . To accomplish this , the engineers made two major compromises . First , instead of developing a new design , they decided to convert a bomber engine , the Bristol Siddeley Olympus , even though the Olympus gulps so much fuel that the Concorde will probably never be able to carry its maximum passenger load of 118 persons much farther than from Paris to New York  --  about 3,700 miles . The second compromise was to build with aluminum , which is inexpensive and easy to work . But the trouble with aluminum is that it begins to lose its strength at about 300 ' F. , which happens to be the temperature caused by the friction of air at about Mach 2.2. or 1,450 mph . Although the European engineers insist that their aluminum alloys will stand up to Mach 2.2 indefinitely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to Ily safely much beyond Mach 1.8 , or 1,200 mph . Both Boeing and Lockheed considered and turned down the idea of building a Mach 2.2 SST . For one thing , they estimated that the aircraft would cost over $20 million to build in this country . The betting here is that the Europeans will never be able to hold the Concorde to $15 million , let alone $10 million . ) Both companies figured it was wiser to charge a few million more and offer an aircraft that would be not only bigger and faster but also capable of future growth in speed and rangeas the Concorde is not . To build a faster SST than the Concorde . Boeing and Lockheed were forced to use heat-resistant titanium , even though it is more expensive than aluminum . But achieving supersonic speed was not the main design problem for the American SST 's . The governing factor was the sonic boom ( see The Sound of Progress , by John Skow , starting on page 25 ) . " We 're worried about the sonic Loom not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't know . " says Maynard L. Pennell , a Boeing vice president . " We do n't know what the tolerance of the public is for the boom , or what it should be . " The FAA itself does not know the answer to either question . but it has ruled that the American SST can not create a sonic boom greater than what the engineers call " two pounds overpressure " ? a shock wave exerting a force of two pounds more per square foot than the normal pressure of the atmosphere . This causes a sound rather like a thunderclap . Ideally , the engineers would like the SST to climb through the sonic barrier at about 25,000 feet , where the air is thick enough to give the wings plenty of support and the engines plenty of oxygen . But at that altitude the thunderclap created by an airplane the size of the 225-ton SST would echo like the crack of doom . Since the boom decreases with increased altitude , it now seems likely that the SST will not be able to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of cracking the barrier at 45,000 feet is the main reason the SST is so expensive , both to build and to operate . First of all , to go supersonic at that altitude , the plane requires special , huge engines that can suck in enough of the rarefied atmosphere to fire effectively . Moreover , to get the SST up to 45,000 feet at inefficient , subsonic speeds will require a tremendous amount of fuel  --  perhaps 25 of the 100 tons it will carry on a long flight . Because it has to carry so much fuel , the SST 's payload is estimated at only about It ) percent of its total weight . compared to the 15 percent payload of today 's jets . A second major design problem of the SST is that the FAA has decreed that the plane must fly as well subsonically as present-day jets , so that it can tit into existing traffic patterns on takeoffs and landings , and use regular runways . Perhaps the most fascinating thing about the competition between Boeing and Lockheed is that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a versatile aircraft . To get the best of both supersonic and subsonic worlds , Boeing plans to change the position of part of each wing in flight . General Dynamics ' new F-111 fighter , which uses the same principle , first performed this trick in flight last month . During takeoffs and landings , approximately the outer half of the SST 's wing will be swept forward so that the wing can grab as much air as possible . At high speeds the wing will be folded back to reduce drag until it is close to the tail when the aircraft hits its cruise speed of about Mach 2.7 or 1.800 mph , at about 65,000 feet . In contrast , Lockheed chose to use an extremely simple wing , known as a double delta , similar to the one on the company 's reconnaissance plane , the A-11 . Because such a wing has to be tilted up to provide sufficient lift at low speeds , the aircraft will have to land with its nose pointed up at about 10 degrees  --  high enough to block the pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lockheed 's SST. which will fly at 2,000 mph at 80,000 feet , hinges the front section of its nose . For landing approaches , this section  --  called the " droop snout " ? will be lowered to give the pilot a clear view . Both companies claim their SST 's would carry 250 passengers-60 more than the maximum capacity of the largest present jet  --  from New York to Paris . And despite the differences in speed and altitude , airlines consider the two remarkably similar in overall performance . If you start down a list comparing the two , " says the chief engineer of one major airline , " you find that one has the advantage in this , and the other has the advantage in something else . It 's almost impossible to make a clear-cut choice between them . " Although the plane would seem unfamiliar to passengers from the outside , the cabin of both SST 's would make present-day jet travelers feel right at home . The windows will be somewhat smaller but the seating arrangement will follow the customary three-andtwo pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little that 's new until they feel the tremendous surge of the great engines , which will give the SST a shorter takeoff run than today 's jets , and the steep angle of climb necessary to carry the engine noise  --  almost certain to be louder than that of present jet engines  --  away from the area surrounding the airport . The aircraft will climb at more than 5,000 feet a minute , so fast that it may be necessary for a computer on board to calculate the precise curve the SST should follow while leveling out , so that the passengers do not find themselves slowly ascending from their seats . There will be no shudder , no sound , no sign at all when the plane goes through the sonic barrier . " The principal difference the passenger will notice , " says Boeing vice president Maynard Pennell. " will be that he gets there a lot sooner . " Increased speed , however , has always posed the threat of increased danger . When jet transports were introduced , they had a number of accidents . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airplanes until they now have impressive safety records . But Jerry Lederer , director of the Flight Safety Foundation , argues that there can be no such learning period for the huge SST  --  the crash of so heavy a plane is likely to leave no survivors . " The SST has to be as safe when it starts to fly as the jets are now , " he says . This is impossible , according to Bo K. O. Lundberg , director general of Sweden 's Aeronautical Research Institute , one of the world 's leading authorities on air safety , and a bitter critic of the SST . Lundberg insists that the plane will be endangered by its large number of untested design features , by the effects of aerodynamic heating , and by its very speed . Traveling at 30 miles a minute , the pilot would not be able to see danger ahead  --  a hailstorm , say , or another aircraft  --  in time to avoid it . Halaby differs sharply with Lundberg . ? Ile aircraft is not inherently more dangerous than its predecessors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , but the barriers that have to be surmounted are higher . I 'm determined not to permit an airplane that is unsafe to be developed . " Trying to anticipate all possible dangers , the SST project engineers , Boeing 's Lloyd Goodmanson and Lockheed 's Richard Heppe , have spent weeks thinking up catastrophes that could befall an SST . One such crisis would be a complete loss of cabin pressure at altitudes of 65,000 feet or more  --  where the atmosphere is so thin that the passengers ' blood would literally boil within a matter of seconds . To prevent such an explosive decompression , Lockheed 's long string of windows will be made of three sheets of glass , each strong enough to carry the load by itself . If by some chance all three panes were broken , the window is so small  --  about six inches across  --  that the air could not squeeze out much ( aster than the pressurization system would replace it . With one window out at 80.000 feet , pressure in the cabin would drop to no lower than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Heppe has wondered , if a berserk gunman got into the pilot 's compartment and took a shot at the windshield ? Since some of its panels are big enough to cause rapid decompression if they were broken , Lockheed will build its windshield strong enough to withstand a bullet 's impact . " We plan to test it in flight by actually firing a gun at it , " says Heppe . Heppe and Goodmanson also spent months testing refinements of their wing shapes after President Johnson rejected their designs last year . For four months , for example . the engineers who run Lockheed 's wind tunnels worked 12 hours on and 12 off , seven days a week . Even in the supersonic age , aerodynamics is far from an exact science . The smartest men with the best computers do not necessarily come up with the best aircraft . Design is a matter of taking theory as far as it goes , and then testing it in the tunnel . Between their first submissions and the ones presently before the McNamara committee , both Boeing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have seen the latest designs . Both companies now say that their SST 's can match today 's jets in economy on long-range flights , although this claim is regarded with considerable skepticism by the major airlines , which have evaluated the two designs as part of the FAA 's study . According to calculations worked out by Robert Rummel , TWA vice president for planning and research , the SST 's seat-mile costs would be , at their very best , between live and eight percent higher than those of today 's jets . Some airline executives feel that the SST as presently designed would be too expensive to fly at long ranges . To carry enough fuel for flights of 4,000 miles , it would have to reduce its passenger load from 250 to about 220 . And the short range problem is even worse . " A New York to Chicago flight would be completely foolish in an SST. " says C. R. Smith . chairman of the board and chief executive officer of American Airlines . " It would n't be anywhere near the present cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 60,000 feet and coming back down . " . When they consider the SST , the airlines have to measure its operating costs against those of various subsonic jets of the future . One possibility , for instance , would be a civilian version of the giant jet transport the Defense Department is planning to develop to carry 600 soldiers as far as 7,000 miles . Such a plane would permit sharply reduced fares . But it would cost nearly as much to buy as the SST , and it would be too heavy for many of the runways of the world . Moreover , the airlines suspect that people might hesitate to fly on a double-decker aerial equivalent of the Staten Island ferry . The U.S. airlines have good reason to insist that the SST be a moneymaker . Under the FAA 's program , they would have to pay royalties to the Government on every SST they bought and used until the United States was repaid the sum it had advanced to develop the aircraft in the first place . The airline industry has agreed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the plane proves not to be economical , the airlines might buy a few dozen to form a small prestige fleet , but they would never buy the hundreds needed to justify the whole complicated , costly program . Despite all the problems involved , however , airline presidents like Smith and TWA 's Tillinghast are generally in favor of developing an SST. for one main reason : They are afraid of becoming dependent upon the Concorde for their survival . With no SST on the market , the American airlines would be forced to buy the Concorde to stay in business . The airlines flying overseas would be the first to face the Concorde , but eventually a domestic airline would buy one , if only for reasons of prestige , and then they all would have to follow suit . " You do n't always buy airplanes when you want to , " says American Airlines ' Smith . " You buy them when you need them to keep your competitive position , or to better it . " A total of eight U.S. airlines have already paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money for the time being ) , and 14 foreign airlines have ordered another 49 . Covering their bets , American airlines have also ordered 21 Concordes . Even if the Concorde turns out to be a commercial success , the market estimates for an American SST now go as high as 400 aircraft , or a sale of about twelve billion dollars . Nevertheless , the manufacturers insist that they can not put up their 25 percent of the costs , as required under the Government proposal , and they argue that the risks involved in such a vast program are so great that the formula could bankrupt them . " The 75-25 split is just no good , " says Jerome McBrearty , a Lockheed vice president . " It that 's what it takes , then there just is n't going to be an SST program . " It now seems likely that the formula will end up closer to 90-10 . What may turn out to be the most frustrating problem of all for the SST is just beginning to emerge from the confusion about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basic questions about the sonic boom and about the economics and safety of the SST will never be settled until someone actually builds a prototype and flies it around for a while . But Congress would have to put up the money for a prototype program  --  upwards of $500 million  --  since only the Government can afford such a sum . And Congress may well insist that the problems be solved before it agrees to hand out that kind of money . Ironically , the force that set the American SST program in motion may now help to slow it down . The Concorde was hopefully named to reflect a spirit of harmonious cooperation between the British and the French , but as things have turned out , Discorde might have been more appropriate . Dismayed by the plane 's soaring costs , Britain 's new Labor Government has indicated that it would like to see the whole program slowed down . Charles de Gaulle 's France , however , has insisted upon pushing ahead as planned  --  or as nearly so as possible , despite problems that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the Concorde would increase the difficulty of getting money out of Congress this year to start building a prototype . And even beyond this , there are indications that the McNamara committee would like the program to spend another year studying the sonic boom and benefiting from the experiences of the A-11 and the new RS-70 bomber flying at Mach 3 . What worries the men in the aircraft industry is that , without the stimulus of the Concorde , the United States program will be allowed to die . " It seems to us that the SST program should go forward no matter what the French and British do , " says Lockheed 's McBrearty . " The whole airline industry has one commodity to sell  --  speed , the saving of time . Speed sells , and the SST will sell seats . If we have only subsonic equipment , we 're forever vulnerable . Germany , France , Britain could enter the field again , and we 'd have to react again . This is a chance for the United States to regain the initiative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
