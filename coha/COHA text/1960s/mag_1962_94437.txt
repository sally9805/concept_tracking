It was an hour before noon , but already the heat rose in low , wiggling waves off the oil-streaked asphalt at Riverside International Raceway , sending the Box Springs Mountains in the background into a shimmering dance under the California sun . On a small bluff overlooking Turn No. 8 , four men stood in a group , watching a small , sleek race car with a blue streak down its nose come whining toward them through the straight . As the BMC Formula Junior passed the first cutoff marker , one of the men punched a stopwatch. // The car began to angle into the corner , and the whine lessened as the driver backed off the accelerator . He braked and the car slowed . There was a quick bur-r-r-p as he downshifted into third . Then he was into the turn . // " He looks good , " said one of the kibitzers. // " He 's too fast , " said the man holding the stopwatch. // Pete Brock has watched a lot of cars come into Turn No. 8 at Riverside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . The front wheels angled in toward the apex of the curve , but the car refused to follow . It began to slide toward the outside of the turn , toward the flat scrubby grass that lines the road , farther and farther off the intended line . Then the driver , who a moment before might have been Phil Hill , suddenly began to look more like Aunt Minnie in a white crash helmet . In desperation he hit the brakes  --  and the little car turned into a top . The back tires lost all adhesion and broke away completely . The car spun around once , halfway around again and off the course . There was a large puff of dust , and then silence . // When the dust drifted away , all four men were standing by the car , peering curiously at the driver , who peered back from behind his goggles like a sheepish owl . // " I should n't have braked ? " he asked . // " Not in the turn , " said Brock . " You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you had made it around , you 'd have set a track record . " He checked the car over quickly . " O.K. , " he said , " go try it again . " // A few basics // The driver and the three others standing with Head Instructor Pete Brock were students at the Carroll Shelby School of High Performance Driving , the first institution of its kind in America and one of the few in the world . Not everyone is fascinated by the problems of taking a precision-engineered automobile through a complicated racecourse at high speed , but if you happen to be one of the afflicted , this is the place to learn . In operation for a year , the school has already produced several outstanding sports car drivers and taught dozens of others enough of the fine points of racing to add a great deal to their appreciation of the sport . // " We 're not trying to turn out professional racing drivers , " says Shelby , who once won 40 of 46 Sports Car Club of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach the student something about racing technique . Heel-and-toe downshifting , proper braking . How a car performs in a corner . The proper line through a turn and how to figure it out . All sorts of things like that . We think that by concentrating on basics we can teach the student to drive faster and more safely and to have more fun . " // Shelby is a tall , lean caricature of a Texan , with curly hair and a brain as quick as a Ferrari in second gear . Until his racing career was cut off in 1960 by a heart condition , he was astute enough to continue driving in his famous old $3 striped overalls even after he could afford cashmere . As a businessman , he has built up a valuable racing-tire franchise and has just developed a new car , the Shelby AC Cobra ( SI , April 30 ) , which is n't going to increase Corvette sales a bit . // " When I was getting started back in the early ' 50s , " he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic things that someone with experience could have taught me in 10 or 12 hours . The sports car clubs have their own drivers ' schools now , but look at the problem they face : 50 or 75 people trying to learn something one afternoon a month . // " Here , " he says , " we keep the classes small , only three to five drivers a week , and we can analyze each one as an individual : what his potential is , his psychological problems , what type of car is best for him . I get six or seven letters a week now from ex-students , telling me about their experiences , asking me for advice on courses and cars , some of them applying to go through the school a second , even a third , time . I do n't know when anything has given me so much satisfaction . " // In the beginning Shelby planned to run the school 52 weeks a year , sharing instruction duties with his partner , Paul O'Shea , a former Mercedes driver who , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Year . Almost immediately he was booked up through October . But then O'Shea left , and Carroll found himself furiously involved with developing the Cobra . The school cars , a D Jaguar and a series of Formula Juniors , began to suffer under the heavy schedule . So Carroll cut the program back to one week a month , plus special weekend classes , substituted a Corvette for the D Jag and hired Pete Brock , a former General Motors design man who had drifted west to become one of the outstanding young Class G modified drivers on the Coast . Now Shelby uses a Cobra in place of the Corvette . // " Pete takes the student through the first two or three days , " says Shelby . " He 's a lot better with beginners than I am . More painstaking . Then I try to handle the last couple of days . " // The cost of instruction is $50 an hour in your own car , $100 an hour if you use school equipment . For the five-day course this means either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money , " says Shelby , " but figure it this way . A guy races for a season , burns up several sets of tires at $200 a set , and he still does n't win anything . Here he can learn something about driving and make it worthwhile . If he 's good enough , he can pay his own way . " // The raceway is located in the little town of Edgemont , five miles from Riverside and 60 miles from L.A. The shriek of B-52 bombers taking off from March Air Force Base to the south blends in with the snarl of the racing cars . These are sounds that racing drivers love , and they show up for a typical school week early on a Monday morning , foot heavy on the throttle . Brock soon slows them down . // First he drives them around the 3.27-mile raceway half a dozen times in a battered old Chevrolet panel truck that serves double duty as a tow car and standby ambulance . " Before you attempt to drive a course you should study it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all is to walk it on foot . You 'll see more that way and the fresh air will do you good . " He points out that the convenient cutoff marker signs before each turn at Riverside are there only for guidance . " The point varies with each driver , each car , each speed , " he explains , " and you may not want to use these at all . Use a boulder or a light pole , whatever feels right to you . Only do n't use a girl in a red dress . She might walk 10 yards down the track between laps , and next time around you 'll find yourself on the other side of the fence . " // There is one very long straightaway at Riverside between Turns 8 and 9 , and here the Formula I cars , like the Grand Prix Lotuses and Coopers , hit 180 miles an hour . The Corvettes used in the school will really fly through here , too , but Brock ignores the straight . " In racing , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to sit back in the seat and relax , to think about what you did wrong on the last lap and how you 'll improve the next time around . Anyone can drive a straightaway . We 'll concentrate on the corners . " // And for a week you concentrate on the corners . The nine turns at Riverside do not resemble one another in the slightest , nor do they match the turns at any other course . But Brock points out that by learning to " read " a corner , by studying it and thinking the problems out , by driving it and testing it you learn something about all corners . And all corners on auto racetracks have some things in common . // " The secret on any turn , " says Brock , " is not the speed at which you enter but the speed at which you come out . But in order to come out fast you have to go in properly and follow the best line through the curve . Basically , here is the procedure . You go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off . Then you brake , hard . While you 're braking you downshift , to keep your revs up so that you will have as much power as you need to get out of the corner fast . Then you take the proper line , for that speed and that corner , and drive the car around as smoothly as you can . If you 're too slow , someone is going to pass you ; if you 're too fast  --  well , you 'll find out about that as we go along . The thing to remember at first is to take it easy until you feel comfortable in the car and know the curve . Then you can begin to work on cutting down your time . " // So Brock diagrams the curve and you walk up and down it , studying the problems . Then he drives through with you , if you are in a Corvette , or leads you through in another car if you are in the Formula Junior . Then he stands at the apex and brings you in closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his toe as you roar past . And you learn more each time you try it until you know that you have this particular curve whipped . Then you go on to another . And pretty soon it becomes easy , and you know that Fangio and Hill could n't beat you through there themselves . And then Brock says , " O.K. , now we 'll go back and try to go through those things fast instead of slow . " // Commencement // About the third day , when you are really driving into the corner and standing on the brakes and putting the car around the turn with something resembling control , Shelby shows up . " Very good , " he says , " but what if there are other cars on the course and you ca n't pick your own line ? What if you have to start high or low ? What if someone carries you in too fast ? What if you find yourself skidding toward that fence or those hay bales ? Then what are you going to do ? " And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . // When the course has been completed Shelby and Brock may take an especially promising student aside . // " Go back to your own region , " they will tell him , " and race as much as you can . Get some experience in traffic . Then after the season come back here , and we 'll teach you how to be a real racing driver . " // As for the rest of the students , they leave happily , convinced that they are racing drivers already . In a way , maybe they are . Can you shift down through two gears while standing on the brake while setting a car up for a perfect line through a decreasing-radius corner that you ca n't even sec because it is just over a hill ? You ca n't ? Well , that 's a breeze for graduates of the Shelby School of High Performance Driving .
