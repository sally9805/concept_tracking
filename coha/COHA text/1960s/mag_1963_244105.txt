THE LAND <P> ( See Cover ) <P> The black and grey Bentley snaked south out of Los Angeles along the Santa Ana Freeway , shook free of the traffic , and began to climb fast on a mountain road through the open country . At the wheel was a shapely brunette beauty-secretary , assistant and part-time chauffeur to the man in the back seat listening to Mantovani on a built-in stereophonic tape recorder . The car stopped on the mountaintop , where a friend was waiting ; the man got out , a trim 6 feet with heavy-lidded blue eyes and an actor 's dash . The wind riffled his wavy , iron-grey hair as he gazed out over Irvine Ranch , the miles and miles of grazing land and citrus groves rolling down to the Pacific . <P> " Right about there we 're going to put a city of 100,000 people , " he said , pointing . " At the heart of it will be a thousand-acre campus for a university with 27,500 students . There 'll be a university town with a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll have different kinds of housing-all income levels-churches , a couple of golf courses . Surrounding the university town will be many other communities , here , there and along the coast . And over there will be jobs-places for men to work . We expect to have about 300,000 people living and working here by 1980 . There 'll be plenty of room for them ; this place is six times the size of Manhattan . " <P> The Monuments . The handsome man who can play such a godlike game is neither conqueror nor commissar , but one of a new breed of artisans arising in the world : the regional planner . The regional planner orchestrates vast areas of wilderness with cities , villages , farms and forests to serve the needs of men . <P> As the planet teems with more and more humanity , his work , with its multiple disciplines-including history , sociology , engineering , botany , geology , hydrography and , above all , architecture-is becoming more and more a pressing necessity .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
