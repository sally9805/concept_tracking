When the first shells whistled in , off-guard Israeli troops were playing a Sabbath soccer game . Within moments along the 70-mile Suez front , Egyptian gunners had opened up with everything from long-range artillery to Russian-made Katyusha rockets . In all , 15 Israeli soldiers were killed and 34 wounded , mostly in the first rounds . The Israelis fired back , accounting for five Egyptian dead and nine wounded . It was the second artillery ambush by the Egyptians in seven weeks , and the first in which the Israelis emerged second best . <P> The barrage signaled yet another notch of military escalation by the Egyptians , who are now more belligerent than at any other time since last year 's Six-Day War . All week , Cairo had feted a group of MIG fighter pilots who claimed to have recently shot down three Israeli planes ( the Israelis dryly commented that " all of our planes returned safely to base " ) . Now Egypt 's War Minister and Commander in Chief , Lieut . General Muhammad Fawzi , visited the Suez front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morale . Just why Egypt 's Gamal Abdel Nasser should fan his people 's warlike mood and risk Israeli retaliation could only be a matter of speculation . Certainly the duel improved home-front morale and Nasser 's political position . It also provided training . Under cover of the Suez barrage , about 70 soldiers crossed the canal and staged an ambush , killing two Israeli soldiers . But the most intricate theory had it that Nasser had been put up to it by his Russian advisers as a warm-up for an attempt to clear the Suez by force . No country has felt the pinch of the Suez shutdown more than Russia , which must send its ships around Africa to Asia in order to keep Hanoi supplied , among other things . The Russians have a dredge in the Mediterranean , and could send it into the canal with a destroyer escort , daring the Israelis to shoot . <P> The Israelis have already come close to a direct clash with the Russians . During September 's artillery exchange , they refrained from hitting the Suez oil refinery-rebuilt since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technicians . This time , the Israelis aimed their guns at the refinery anyway , setting fire to three oil storage tanks . <P> Helping the Hawks . Even so , Israel 's response was unusually restrained . Israelis have increasingly been goaded by raiding commandos based in Jordan and Egypt and encouraged by the extremist government of Syria . The new attack could only undermine Israel 's doves , at a time when Foreign Minister Abba Eban was in Jerusalem for a Cabinet decision on how far to go toward peace with Egypt and Jordan . Eban 's hawkish opponents argue that Jordan 's King Hussein is not strong enough to make a peace agreement stick , given the adamant opposition of Jordan-based commandos and Nasser 's mood . <P> For the moment , Israel and Jordan seemed willing to go on talking indirectly through the U.N . ' s go-between , Gunnar Jarring . But it is questionable how much longer the slim restraints of Jarring 's mission can keep the Israelis from resorting to a major retaliation against the newly bellicose Arabs .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
