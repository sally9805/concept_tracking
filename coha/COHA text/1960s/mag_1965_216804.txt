" Remind me , " Dwight Eisenhower once ordered an aide , " never to invite that fellow down here again ! " <P> " What , " groaned John F. Kennedy , " am I going to do about him ? " <P> The target of both Presidents ' outbursts was Otto Passman , the Tabasco-tempered Democrat from Monroe , La. , who for the past ten years has devoted most of his abrasive energies to the task of slashing foreign aid bills . As chairman of House Appropriations ' foreign operations subcommittee , Passman , a graduate of Bogalusa Commercial Business College , has long been convinced that the best way to lose foreign friends is to " start supporting them with gifts and favors . " Wielding what he calls " a countryman 's ax " on global giveaways , Passman since 1955 has been principally responsible for trimming presidential aid requests by an average of 20% a year , for a total of nearly $20 billion . <P> Cajun Cassius . Yet for nearly an hour last week as he roared and wriggled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House , Passman , 65 , seemed only a shadow of the man whom his foes have feared and derided as a Cajun Cassius . As he said himself : " I have had my wings cropped . " <P> That was putting it mildly . In autocratic Otto 's years as lord high executioner of foreign aid bills , the chairman of his parent committee had been Missouri 's curmudgeonly Clarence Cannon , another handout hater , who gave Passman a free hand to slash as he saw fit . But when Cannon died last year , the House Appropriations chairmanship went to Texas ' George Mahon , a middle-of-the-road Democrat , who set about taming the Tartar . Though he let Passman stay on as chairman of the subcommittee , he pared it from eleven to nine members , most of whom favor foreign aid . Passman found himself powerless . Where , in his heyday , subcommittee hearings had dragged on for months , this year 's sessions were rushed through in eleven weeks by the new membership . Under Mahon 's orders , Chairman Passman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You ca n't take the right of writing the report away from me . " Mahon bluntly replied that he could and had , since most of the subcommittee did not agree with Passman . <P> Fulsome Apology . Instead of resigning the chairmanship , Passman last week chose the chastening task of managing a $3.3 billion foreign aid bill that he abominated-and had been able to trim by only $75 million , a mere nick by former standards . It was one of the strangest performances in the memory of the House . <P> <P> For 52 minutes , while he presented his own bill to the House , Passman savagely attacked it and all " the imaginary accomplishments of the foreign aid program . " And then , after fulsome apologies , Passman turned around and started fighting for the bill . " I represent the majority of the committee and not necessarily my personal views , " he said . " It will be my responsibility to defend it to the fullest extent of my ability . " When Republicans moved to cut $285 million out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion will be voted down .
