txt BRITAIN IMPOSES 15% IMPORT TAX TO BACK POUND U.S. SYMPATHETIC But Exporters Here Fear Measure Will Cut Sales Sharply By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH Special to The New York Times LONDON , Oct , ** new Labor Government announced today the introduction of a temporary 15 per cent surcharge on imports and tax incentives ' for exports as part of a broad program to protect the pound and strengthen the British economy . The Government said the nation this year faced the biggest balance-of-payments deficit in its history  --  between ? 700 million and ? 800 million ( $1,96 billion and $2.24 billion ) . The deficit , amounting to nearly as much as the ? 900 million ( $2.52 billion ) of British gold and convertible currency reserves , has arisen mainly because this key trading nation has been unable to sell as much as she buys overseas . Trade Gap Swells Last month , the trade gap , at ? 133 million ( $372.4 million ) , was the widest this year . The huge deficit represents a potential drain on reserves , which , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( In the United States , the Government and the export trade accepted the necessity of the British program , but made it clear that sales in Britain would be reduced substantially . European Governments and businessmen were generally dissatisfied with the export levy . In what was billed as a " fireside " chat to the nation , Prime Minister Harold Wilson emphasized tonight the temporary nature of the new measures and said that what was basically needed was a change in the nation 's approach to economic matters . Speaking for 10 minutes over Britain 's two television networks , he called the situation " extremely serious " but said it " can and will be handled . " Mr. Wilson said that , although Britain made sacrifices in two World Wars , " the world does not owe us a living . " Hard-Sell Urged A more aggressive approach to winning export orders was needed in the board room , the Prime Minister said , adding in words reminiscent of those of President Kennedy : " We have got to think less of what we can get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can get into it . We ought to think more about earning money and less about making it . " George Brown , Minister fol . Economic Affairs , and James Callaghan , Chancellor of the Exchequer , stressed at a news conference that Britain was not becoming protectionist . They said the measures would not affect Britain 's determination to seek broad worldwide tariff cuts under the Kennedy round of negotiations or the elimination of tariffs in the European Free Trade Association . A Conservative party spokesman indicated later in the day // Britain Imposes 15% Import Tax as Part of Plan to Arrest Growing Trade Deficit MEASURE IS AIMED AT BUOYING POUND Plan Also Gives Incentives to British Exporters and Seeks Income Policy // that the party agreed in principle with Labor 's program . A flat 15 per cent surcharge on imports  --  tp be added to existing duties  --  goes into effect at midnight tonight . The only exceptions are foodstuffs including animal feed , basic raw materials for industry , and unmanufactured tobacco . This levy , like regular import duties , will be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the basic value plus the cost of freight and insurance . With the surcharge , the Government hopes mainly to reduce the import value of goods it believes the British should be manufacturing themselves . In the past , Britain has clamped down on the domestic economy to protect her reserves . Growth Had Been Slowed This has meant high interest rates and high unemployment , and has curbed the over-all growth of the economy . The Labor Government has rejected this " stop-go " approach and , in effect , is asking Britain 's trading partners to understand her problem and help by accepting the temporary measures without retaliation . As a result , industrial nations are most affected by the new levies . The hardest hit are France , West Germany , Italy , Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg , the six members of the Common Market . A total of 57 per cent of the bloc 's exports to Britain will be subject to the new charge . Effects Are Given Forty-eight per cent of United States exports to Britain are affected ; 36 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austria , Denmark , Norway , Portugal , Sweden , Switzerland and Finland , which is an associate member ) ; 13 per cent from the Commonwealth and 13 per cent from the rest of the world . Britain is the second biggest customer of the United States after Canada . Last year , total American exports were $21,014 , - 000,000 , of which $1,161,000,000 went to Britain . Under the export incentive plan , those who sell abroad will be relieved of some of the indirect taxation that enters into their costs of production . Although the plan has yet to be worked out in detail , tax rebates are expected to average 1% per cent of the value of exported goods . The cost of the plan is estimated at ? 70 million ( $196 million ) a year . Other Parts of Program Other parts of the over-all program , announced in a Government white paper , are : ( IPlans to get both labor and management to increase productivity and agree to an " incomes policy " under which all forms of income would be related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easier for workers to change jobs in accordance with the needs of technological progress . ( More rapid development of underused areas of the country . CA. strict review of all Government expenditure to relieve strains on the balance of payments and release resources for more productive purposes by cutting out spending on items of low economic priority such as " prestige projects . " In this connection , the Government said it had already communicated to France its wish to re-examine " urgently " the joint project for building the supersonic Concord airliner . ( Undertaking of social programs but stating what is involved and how their costs will be met . IlConsultation with the International Monetary Fund on an already approved standby credit of $1 billion , which Britain may use to shore up her reserves . Desired Impact Cited The Government said it believed these immediate measures would " halt the drift and set the economy moving in the right direction . " Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Reginald Maudling said the Conservative Opposition would not oppose the measures " in principle . " At a news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . he said the white paper bore out the diagnosis of the economy made by the Conservative Government and that he might have taken similar steps , although he would probably have waited a month or two longer . Before leaving the Treasury , he said , he gave orders to have all the possibilities of import restrictions and export subsidies examined for future action . Import surcharges and tax relief to exporters seemed the most promising , Mr. Maudling said , but there were these disadvantages : Foreign countries might retaliate . Higher import charges might promote inefficiency and " featherbedding " in industry , Companies would be faced with higher costs for machinery and semi-manufactured goods , which could affect their export prices . The former Chancellor said : " It is true that the Labor Government have inherited our problems , although they seem also to have inherited our solutions . " He took exception to the estimate of this year 's balance-of-payments deficit made by the Government , which he said contained " an element of exaggeration . " The Government estimate , he said , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in Brit-I ain 's favor this year . Earlier this year , responsible economic groups had placed the deficit at about ? 500 million ( $1.4 billion ) . Mr. Maudling did , not offer a new estimate . Both the former Chancellor and the white paper said the ideficit would show considerable improvement next year even without today 's measures . This is largely because the rise in import prices seems to be tapering off . The white paper said that , even with a considerable improvement , the deficit would still be at an unacceptable level ? hence the reason for today 's " strictly temporary action . " The measures were softer than had been expected , and the stock market responded favorably both from relief and the belief the steps may do some good . Late last week , rumors swept the financial district that the Government planned a 15 per cent tax on capital invested overseas . There were further rumors that there would be cutbacks in overseas travel spending . Share prices advanced modestly in the stock market , with the Financial Times common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exporting companies , such as Leyland , British Motors and Imperial Chemical Industries , led the advance . Government bonds rose , and the pound strengthened against the dollar in the foreign exchange market . Late in the afternoon , the pound was quoted at $2.783 , e , up l3-cent . An important foreign dealer said the pound should continue moving up gradually as traders took stock of the news . The new import charges and export incentives will oe introduced in legislation shortly after Parliament reopens Nov. 3 . It was speculated today that some new taxes might be introduced at that time . A long-term capital-gains tax and some checks on distribution of profits to shareholders are among the measures the Labor party has said are needed to get workers to agree to curbing wage demands . The new import surcharges mean that a vast range of goods , from wine to imported cars , will cost more in Britain . How much will be absorbed and how much passed on to the consumer were the big questions tonight . Chancellor of the Exchequer Callaghan said he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent should automatically increase prices by 15 per cent . " That is a fallacy which must be destroyed , " he said . A spokesman for the Wine and Spirit Association of Great Britain said that wines selling for between $3.50 and $4.20 a bottle are likely to rise by 35 cents , an increase of about 10 , per cent .
