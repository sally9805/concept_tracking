Being a collection of mortals , some Congressmen are lazy or incompetent , others drink too much , some have a trained eye for a trim ankle , and a few-are not overly honest . The House is generally tolerant of all such failings , which makes it all the more unusual that the House is actually trying to do something about Harlem 's Adam Clayton Powell Jr . <P> Powell , 54 , a ten-term Congressman , has long offended the more tender sensibilities in Congress . What really got Powell 's colleagues aroused was the junket he took to Europe last August . He went ostensibly to study the labor situation , or the Common Market , or something . As it turned out , the trip involved considerable research in French nightclubs and sunbathing in Greece in company with two young female aides . Powell 's headline-making , who-cares manner of junketing called into criticism the whole system of congressional travels-and it was this that was not forgiven . <P> Since then the House has adopted rules tightening up on foreign travel , taking particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose members can go abroad only under special conditions , and then only at Government per diem expense rates . Now a group in the House Administration Committee is planning to cut deeply into Powell 's request for $697,000 to support his committee this year ; this would be almost unprecedented , since a committee chairman 's fund requests are generally routinely approved . <P> House members are forbidden to attack one another personally , but Delaware 's Republican Senator John J. Williams recently spoke for many of Powell 's colleagues in a scorching denunciation of Powell on the Senate floor . Citing a federal grant of $250,000 to a Powell-sponsored project to fight juvenile delinquency in Harlem . Williams declared that Powell " could well be recognized as an authority on ' adult delinquency. ' but most certainly he is not the caliber of man whom the American people would want to set an example for the youth of our country . " <P> " Demagogue &; Playboy . " Powell 's record is a many-splendored thing . There is. for example , his Puerto Rican-born third wife . Yvette. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $3,000-a-year clerk on his staff . She is now on his payroll as a $12,974 secretary , and still draws the salary though she spends almost all her time in their $45,000 beach home in Puerto Rico . The Internal Revenue Service claims that Powell still owes $41,015 in income tax and penalties for 1949-55 . And Powell is one of the House 's most notorious absentees : he has responded on the average to less than half the roll-call votes over the last decade . All this has contributed to the feeling expressed last week by one disgusted colleague : " He is a demagogue , a high liver , a playboy and a charlatan . ' ' Said another : " I do n't know exactly how you decide who 's the worst Congressman , but Adam 's certainly in the finals . " <P> Yet even those who criticize Powell most severely admit that he has great talents which , properly used , could make him an outstanding legislator . Says one of his fellow committee members : " He 's a charming man , enormously talented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman . I think he still does , but he has a low level of frustration . When things are n't going well , he 'll just beat it . "
