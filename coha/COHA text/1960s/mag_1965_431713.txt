 | It 's strange what women will and wo n't talk about with their friends . Take a new mother on her first day back at the bridge club . She 's almost expected to give a blow-by-blow account of her labor and delivery , so that she and her friends can compare notes . She would seem quaintly Victorian if she held back . And these days anything seems to go on the subject of mothers-in-law also . Time was when young wives restrained themselves on this topic , but now it 's considered perfectly okay to say whatever comes to mind . There is one topic , however , one grief and disappointment of early marriage , that no one mentions aloud . I 'd like to bring that topic out in the open right now . Possibly I 'll convince you that it is n't such a humiliation as you thought and thatreally ? it happens to everybody . What I have in mind is that inevitable moment when the onceradiant bride ? now a young matron of one or two or three or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " he is n't in love with me any more . " At first she may try to reassure herself by deciding she 's just being oversensitive and overdemanding ( marriage ca n't be orchids-andchampagne all the time ) ; or that lately she has n't been affectionate or alluring enough . Such thoughts may make her launch a very special campaign to " make him fall in love all over again , " but her campaign does n't work . He appreciates the extra attention , but he still drops his dirty @# socks on the bedroom floor . Eventually she is likely to decide that she is n't in love any more either . Then , if she 's typical , she silently resigns herself to the idea that she and her man were n't quite right for each other after all ; not completely wrong , mind you , but not one-hundred-percent precisely right either . She tells herself that only a few married couples stay in love , but they are the lucky ones . What she does n't know is that almost every other young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple truth is that no one stays " in. love , " not in the romantic sense where you feel electrified when you 're near him , and limp and anxious every moment he 's away . Romantic love is a fraud ? a great and glorious fraud that no lifetime should be without . . . . It 's a fraud because it 's temporary . t HEN THE SLEIGH RIDE 'S OVER Sooner or later the sleigh ride 's over and there you are tossed out in the snow with a ' man ? an all-toohuman and ( this is the hardest to admit ) ordinary man ? who 's all yours to keep and live with for a probable forty or fifty years . It 's a puzzlement , is n't it ? A few of us feel so betrayed , or so much crave the sensation of being wildly in love , that we pick ourselves up and walk away ? solo . Then another sleigh ride , and another bump back to reality . The rest of us resign ourselves to conditions as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or that we 've failed somewhere , or that our judgment was faulty . We settle down to " work at marriage , " but somehow it has become an obligation we 're stuck with , not a joy . But what starts happening to a few couples ? and this can happen to you if you 'll let it ( whether your sleigh ride ended twenty days ago or twenty years ) ? is that they start learning to love each other and enjoy each other without being romantically " in love . " You do n't have to be unusually mature to find this kind of happiness in marriage , and you do n't have to be exceptionally lucky . Or a portrait of self-sacrifice . The only absolute necessity is basic common sense . You have to be sensible enough to let yourself believe certain facts which you 've always known to be true , but have somehow lost sight of . The reason that happens to so many of us is that we belong to a generation which has been misled . We 've come under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have partly blunted our own good sense and judgment . THE HOLLYWOOD INFLUENCE First Propaganda Machine : Hollywood ? I do n't mean the Hollywood of today but the tinsel and stardust Hollywood of our growing-up years . When we were in our teens , you and I and our friends were in one respect very much like the teenagers of today . We found it almost impossible to look to our  | own parents as models for conducting a courtship and romance , but sought guidelines elsewhere . During those impressionable years our biggest influence was Hollywood . Remember ? And that was n't such a good preparation for grown-up love . Colbert and Grable and Norma Shearer were always so lovely and brave and perfect . And always so humorless , too , when you get down to it , just like their leading men . I think it 's really difficult at times for those of us who grew up during the big star heyday to come back down to earth . A part of us still believes that marriage is about people who are always unruffled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANUALS And that brings us to the Second Propaganda Machine : a battery of supposedly enlightened , supposedly modern books and articles on the sexual side of marriage . While we were up there waltzing with Hollywood we were also sneaking glances at those ostensibly scientific marriage manuals . But most of these books weren't -- and are n't ? really scientific . On the contrary , they present a highly distorted picture of the emotional content of sex and make the act of physical love seem mechanical ? purely a matter of technique . And even more misleading , they imply the sexual nature of woman is just like the sexual nature of man , only slower . That is n't true . And any woman who trusts herself and her own reflexes knows it is n't . The trouble is that some women do n't trust themselves and feel that unless they always react the way books say they should , they are sexual failures . They are the women who find little enjoyment in physical love and come to look at it as a chore . How do we reconcile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love becomes the obligatory side of marriage while getting breakfast for your husband becomes the supposedly intimate and delightful part of the day . ( Like it was for Claudette Colbert . ) It 's all very confusing . When the sleigh ride ends ,  | it 's hard to love and cherish a reallive husband whose faults we know all too well . ( And worse yet , who knows our faults even better . ) WHAT TO D0 ABOUT IT Here are some pointers that might he helpful . There 's nothing new or amazing about them ; they 're just tips that are often forgotten . 1 . Learn to like yourself again as you really are , not as the fairy princess he imagined when you floated toward him down the aisle . It 's such a joy to have someone think we 're perfect that many formerly sensible girls get carried away and feel hurt when reality sets in . The thing to do is to remember that the real you is lovable too ; maybe not worshipable , but lovable. 2 . Understand the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too upset when things seem to be turning sour . It 's psychologically true that opposites attract . We fall in love with someone who has qualities that seem to compensate for some of our own most secretly regretted weaknesses . The laughing , sociable girl tends to fall in love with the enigmatic boy v.-hose " still waters run deep " and vice versa . When we suspect we carry a trait to excess , we look for a mate who will help us modify it . Now actually this makes common sense , as well as romantic sense . It helps us achieve balance as a family unit . But it does make for arguments along the way , and even occasional hostility and contempt . 3 . Remember that a good physical relationship depends on being honest ? allowing ourselves to be what we are and not striving for what we would like to be or think we ought to he . Women are more inward and quiet in their sexual feelings because , in female physiology , the childbearing function reigns supreme . ( In males the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife can learn to accept her husband 's maleness and her own femininity ? neither to chide him for being crude , nor herself for being cold ? then , almost magically and without working for It . she is likely to find she does love him physically . @#  | 4 . Go out of your way to keep yourself sweet and dainty for him , even at the price of being glamorous for other people . 5 . Continue to explore , have fun and develop together . Do n't confine yourselves to run-of-the mill activities ( which one of you is sure to enjoy more than the other ) , but seek out new things which might turn out to be unexpected fun for you both . CHUCK AND ANNETTE I once knew a young couple whom I 'll call Chuck and Annette whose story illustrates many of the points I 've been making . Chuck was the kind of a person who was always the life of the party while Annette was almost painfully reserved . Her feelings about him went through three distinct stages , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most marriages that really " take . " Stage one : she leaned on him adoringly , and felt exhilarated being in the thick of things on his arm . Stage two : boredom and annoyance set in . Being basically serious by nature she began to feel that that much social life was irresponsible . For several years the marriage floundered , because like so many couples who have once been gloriously in love they felt that their perfect understanding had betrayed them and fled . Actually it had never existed except in their own dreams . Stage three : they learned to " use " and rely on their differences ? Chuck as the social manager , and Annette the doer of lonely tasks . He joined clubs and civic groups and earned social credits for the family while she , by balancing checkbooks , watching bills and keeping tax records , kept them on top of practical matters . And each , furthermore , was glad to be rid of the functions that did n't appeal to him ? and grateful . A new level of respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sounds dull , but it is n't ; Chuck and Annette found the kind of workable , working love relationship which is not only far more durable than being frantically " in love " but is also much more satisfying . Their kind of married love is the kind that truly can last forever .
