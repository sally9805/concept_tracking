The managers of U.S. big business who earn more than half a million dollars a year belong to an exclusive club whose membership is hardly more than a dozen or two . Among them , the man who presides over Massachusetts Investors Trust , the nation 's oldest and second largest mutual fund , receives one of the fattest paychecks . <P> The M.I.T. chairman gets more than $360,000 in a moderately good year , plus another $200,000 for doubling as boss of the sister fund , Massachusetts Investors Growth Stock Fund . ( Though generous , this is still well below General Motors Chairman . Frederic Donner , who made $800,000 in 1964 . ) Starting soon , the huge M.I.T. check will be made out in the name of a new man . Last week the fund announced that Kenneth L. Isaacs , 60 , M.I.T. 's vice chairman for the past eleven years , will succeed Dwight P. Robinson Jr. , 65 , as board chairman . <P> Slim Staff . Salaries at M.I.T. are based on a percentage of total assets and income-and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fund has increased its total assets by 25% to $2.1 billion , and the value of shareholders ' investments and reinvested dividends has risen more than 36% . The fund even rode out the 1962 market slump with a minimum of damage because of its cautious policy of investing in reliable , high-quality stocks . Despite the company 's bigness , M.I.T. 's billions are still tended by only five trustees , ten senior investment analysts , and a home office work force of 39 ( including messengers ) . Result : the cost of managing the fund is a bare $1.80 per $1,000 of assets , which M.I.T. claims is the lowest operating cost of any mutual fund . <P> Isaacs will make few changes in the way M.I.T. is run , since he has participated in all the major decisions that have set the fund 's management style and investment policy . At Lehigh ( ' 25 ) he got an engineering background ; he now keeps personal watch on M.I.T. 's railroad , metal and mining investments . He has an exemplary record as a Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the manager of Cornell 's endowment investments be fore joining M.I.T. in 1936 as an investment analyst . Within a year , he was made a full trustee . Isaacs is mostly responsible for recruiting M.I.T. 's young and bright research staff . <P> Rising Competition . Isaacs , low-spoken and affable , is very much a part of the Boston establishment : his clubs include the Somerset , the Dedham Country and Polo and the Tennis &; Racquet . He lives with his wife , who is a portrait painter , and their two children on a 500-acre farm near Boston . Besides his M.I.T. duties , he serves on several boards , carefully cultivates the fund 's ties with the business community . Though he feels that rising competition is one of the main problems he will face as chairman , he also sees in it a bright side for M.I.T. The entry into mutual funds by Sears Roebuck and other companies , he says , means that mutual funds will inevitably become better known . Isaacs is sure that M.I.T. will benefit .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
