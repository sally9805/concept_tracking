 | " I 've got nearly six dollars left , " she said eagerly , " from my last pay , after the train and all . And seventy-five dollars in my bankbook  --  nearly seventy-eight with interest . " She dug the bankbook out of her handbag . " Put it away , Annie dear . It 's your own money and we are not going to use it to pay bills . " He reported on his financial position . Tuition paid until June . His meals no problem . He earned three meals a day working as bus boy at the Townly Cafeteria . He earned five dollars for delivery of the college newspaper from six to eight in the morning . And his mother had been sending him five a week . Ten dollars clear , thought Annie . He must have been able to save a lot . As if he knew her thoughts , he said , " I suppose I should have saved some of that . But I needed . . . " He had needed shoes and socks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . Tennis balls and his racket restrungice skates sharpened .. . " And haircuts , " contributed Annie . " Trims , " he admitted . " Twice a month . A pack of cigarettes a day . And , oh , toothbrushes and toothpaste , the Sunday paper , notebooks , stamps , stationery , and a movie once in a while with the fellers with a hot dog and near-beer afterwards . Oh , and laundry and . . . " " Money sure flies , do n't it , Carl ? " " You can say that again . " He took her hand in both of his . " I might as well tell you this , Annie , before you find it out from someone else . " He took a deep breath . " I took a girl to a class dance . " How many times ? " " Just once . That meant a taxi both ways and a corsage and a midnight supper . " She had to swallow very hard before she could say : " That 's none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just engaged . Naturally , that does n't count . "  | " But , sweetheart , I had to take a girl out once in a while or the fellers would think I was queer . Besides , we were not alone . ' There was a party of us . " " I suppose , " she said formally , " I , too , should make a similar confession . Unfortunately , however , I have nothing to tell . I considered it would n't be fair to . . . oh , never mind . " " Now , Annie dear . Now . " She moved away from him on the bench . " Were you able to save any money ? " " How could I ? I had to buy textbooks , and they cost like hell even if they are secondhand . " " And corsages cost like hell , too , do n't they ? " " Know something ? " He grinned . " I think you are jealous . " " Yes , I am . " " Jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then : I 'm inferior . " " Let 's cut out this nonsense , Annie . Okay ? " " Okay . Just so it does n't happen again . " " I swear ! " " Okay , then . " " Do you think we can get along on ten dollars a week ? " " We 'll only have five . Your mother 's not going to send you money when she knows you 're married . " " Oh , I do n't know . She may be a little upset when she hears the news , but she 'll get over it . All she wants in the world is for me to be happy . " " With her . " " You 've got her all wrong , sweetheart . You 'll like Mom after you get to know her . After all , you only saw her once . " She had been fifteen then , the time he took her to see his mother . The Browns lived in a neighborhood like Annie 's and had the same type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no clutter . Annie 's home was pretty untidy . But then both  | Annie and her mother worked away from home and the two little brothers all but took the place apart . Now , Carl 's mother had nothing to do except keep house . And the family was grown up . Tessie , Carl 's forty-year-old spinster sister , kept her room neat and Carl had kept his neat . In Annie 's house the parlor was used only for company . In the Brown house the parlor was turned over to Carl as a bed-sitting room . When Annie had commented on it , Mrs. Brown had said the best was none too good for her only son . Carl took Annie into his room . He was anxious to show her his awards and trophies  --  a medal for winning a hundred-yard dash ; a silver cup for fancy-figure ice skating , and the framed picture of the Y.M.C.A. basketball team with Carl sitting in the middle and holding the ball because he had been captain that year . But Annie was most interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the seventh grade , and the books it held . She was impressed when he said he owned all the books . Annie had never owned a book . He told her to choose any one she wanted as a present . She knelt before the bookcase as though it were an altar . She crossed her hands on her breast in an ecstasy of delicious indecision . Should she take the volume of Sherlock Holmes because it had a lot of reading to it ? Or the slim volume of Sonnets from the Portuguese because it was so beautiful  --  soft green leather binding and tasseled , gold cord bookmark ? Carl looked down at the heavy coil of hair at the back of her head , held in place by two bone hairpins . On an impulse , he pulled out the pins . She jumped up with a yelp when she felt her hair cascade down her back . She demanded her hairpins , and he challenged her to try to get them . She chased him around the room . He high-jumped a Morris chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed after him but lost her footing in the soft bedclothes and fell sprawling on the bed .  | He leaned over Annie and said , " Now I got you where I want you . " At that precise moment his mother came in . " My God ! " she said . Annie sat up , her hair disordered , face flushed , and tried to pull her short , tight skirt down over her knees . " Take it easy , Mom , " said Carl . " It 's not what you think . " " I 'm ashamed of you , Carl . So ashamed , " his mother said . " And what kind of girl is that to lie in your bed , with her skirts up around her neck and all ? " " Listen , Mom , I took her hairpins and her hair fell down and . . . " " I do n't want to hear any more . I think she 'd better go home . " " Do n't worry , " said Annie . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pins out of his hand . " And as for you , Carl , I never want to see you again . And that goes double for your mother . " She walked out with her head high . He found her down in the vestibule , tears in her eyes and the pins in her mouth , trying to coil up her hair . Her hands were trembling . Clumsily , he helped her get the pins in . " I told Mom how it had happened and made her believe it . And she 's awfully sorry , Annie , and wants you to come back and stay for supper . " " I 'd choke on her food . " " But you can understand , Annie , how Mom got the wrong idea  --  you on the bed , me almost on top of you ? " " She could have listened when you tried to tell her how it happened , could n't she ? But no ! She wanted to think it was something dirty because she hated me from the first moment she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treating me like a prostitute . " " She said she was sorry . " " An easy thing to say after she had the fun of telling me off . I ) oes she think sorry ' is a word like a rubber eraser she can use to rub out the dirty way she thought of me and the things she said ? "  | Annie had cried then ; cried so long that Carl had to skip his night school class to take her to see Charlie Chaplin . Annie sighed now , remembering . " That 's true . I only saw her once . If I had gone back for supper , it might have been different . " " Be fair , Annie . What about your mother ? Did she put out the red carpet for me ? Not so you 'd notice it . She treated me like Carl the Ripper , out to ruin her innocent baby . But I never hated her for that . I figured that she was worried because you were only a little kid and she was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess there 'll always be mother-in-law trouble , " she said . " Ah , no . I think they 'll come around in time . And if they do n't , what of it ? We 've got to live our life the way they had to live theirs . " He wanted a cigarette , but the package was empty . He balled it up and threw it away . " Damn it , I 'm out of cigarettes . " " Wait ! " She got a new pack out of her handbag . " Here . I bought them just before I got on the train so that in case you ran out I could surprise you . " " You 're a sweetheart . " He stretched out his legs , spread his arms along the back of the bench and drew deeply on his cigarette . Somewhere a bell tolled the half hour . " Happy ? " he asked . " Contented . " " When are you going to start being happy ? " " Oh , I was happy this morning when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I 'm contented . " " What 's the difference between happiness and contentment , wise guy ? " " Well , happy is like when somebody gives you a big lump of something wonderful and it 's too big to hold . So you pull off a piece from time to time to hold in your hand . That 's being contented . Anyway , that 's the way I look at it . " " Know what you are ? " " What ? "  | " A personality kid . Know what that means ? " " Does that mean being full of being a person ? " she asked . " I had n't thought of that , but that 's exactly what it means . " He ground out his cigarette and put an arm around her . " Know something ? We 've been married nearly an hour now , and I have n't slept with you yet . Now , there 's a nice thick bush over there and nobody 's looking . How about it ? " " Carl , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but her giggle gave her away . He lifted a strand of her hair and kissed her ear . " Did that give you a thrill ? " he asked . " Do it again , " she said . He laughed and did it again . " For such a sad , sad girl , " he said , " you are very funny . " He lifted his wrist to check the time . She put her hand over the watch . " It 's twelve-thirty , Carl , and you know it . You do n't have to look at the watch every minute . " Annie did n't like the watch . She knew his mother had given it to him for Christmas and sometimes when he looked at it she remembered again the time she was on the bed and his mother had thought .. . " What 's on your mind ? " he asked . " Food . " " Tell you what : Let 's skip the game , sweetheart . We ca n't make it anyway . I 'll have no trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the best wedding lunch in town . What do you say ? " " I say , grand ! " She freshened up in the library washroom while Carl went to the dorm to store her suitcase . He came back with the weekly letter from his mother . It had the usual five-dollar money order enclosed . " Let your mother know you 're married , Carl , before she sends you more money .  | " I think I ought to prepare her first ; write that you 're here and we 're thinking of getting married , and follow that up with a letter saying we are married . " " I think it 's better to let her know right away . " " It might be a bit of a shock . Let me do it my way , Annie . " " Well , I 'm going to wire my mother right away . " She sent a wire saying she was married and happy . Carl wrote on a card that Annie was with him and they were thinking of marrying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He had no trouble selling his football tickets . He stood in front of the Sport Shop and held them out . In a few seconds he had sold them for six dollars . Since he had got his ticket for nothing , and bought a dorm mate 's ticket for a dollar , Carl was pleased with his five-dollar profit  --  that is , until he saw the man to whom he had sold the tickets resell them to someone else for eight dollars . I They went to the nicest restaurant in town and had the most expensive lunch on the menu ; seventy-five cents . Carl ordered a bottle of near-beer and two glasses . It was n't champagne , he said , but a luxury just the same at thirty-five cents a bottle . Annie did n't like it , so Carl drank the whole bottle . The place was almost empty , and the waiter , suspecting they restaurant instead of an eat-and-run cafeteria . A whole lazy afternoon ahead ; no split seconds to make a class and my Annie here with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich , " she said , " because I 'd be used to  | were newly married , hovered over them and served them with a flourish . Carl and Annie had little to say to each other during the meal because both were very hungry . After Carl 's second cup of coffee and Annie 's second piece of pie a la mode , they relaxed . Carl lit a cigarette , leaned back in his chair , and sighed con- 1 tentedly . " This is the life , " he said . " Good food , well served in a fine things like that and I 'd never have that , you know : First fine glorious rapture ' ? " " You sure like to live , do n't you , Annie ? " " You talk funny . Everybody likes to live . " " Do me a favor ? " " Sure . " " Do n't ever change . Stay the way you are . " " Oh , I could n't give you a guarantee on that . No . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is full of people . " " No kidding ! " " And people are persons . " " You mean individuals . " " All right . Individual persons . Persons change . A person gets old and old makes him different . So he changes whether he wants to or not . " " I ask you a simple question , my girl , and you go all away around the mulberry bush . " " All I 'm saying is , persons have to change . I am a person . I will change . " " And all I 'm saying is : Deep down do n't change . " " You mean funnel-melody ? " He laughed until he coughed . When he got his breath , he said , " That word happens to be pronounced fun-da-ment-ally . " She looked at the waiter , hoping he had not heard her blunder and Carl 's correction . But the waiter was grinning and Annie hung her head . " It 's a word in a book I read . I never heard anybody say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I thought I was saying it right . But I 'm , " she had to wait for the right word to come to her , " but I 'm grateful for the correction . " " Ah , I 'm sorry , sweetheart . So sorry . But you asked me always to correct you when ... " " But not in front of people . It makes me feel . oh , I do n't  | know . . . " Her voice trailed off . " But you know what I mean . " They went back to their campus bench and spent the afternoon recalling incidents which Annie referred to a little gaudily as from out of our past . " " Just think , " she said , " if I had n't started that serial in that magazine and did n't have to go to the library to see if the new number was there with the ending ... " " And , " he said , " if on that special night my sister had n't pestered me to go and see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We might never have met , " they said simultaneously . That possibility gave them the shudders . " And if . . . " they said together . " Let me talk , Carl . If you had n't walked me home that night , we would not be married today . " " I had to walk you home . I was afraid you 'd be raped on one of those dark streets  --  a cute little fourteen-year-old kid like you . " " Kid nothing ! I was holding down a full-time job at the time . I could 've taken care of myself . " " I bet ! " " And , you know , when you left me at my door you acted as though you did n't want to see me again and I felt just terrible ? " " I did n't want anything to do with you . I was a man of sixteen at the time and you were too young for me . " " What made you change your mind ? " " Well , when I said good-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile and said , So long for a while . ' What could I do ? " " Say ! Remember , Carl , that Sunday we rode back and forth all day on the Staten Island ferry on the one fare ? And we had a box of soda crackers to throw to the gulls and they flew back and forth all day , following us ? " " Hey , Annie , remember that Sunday at Coney Island ? " " Do I ! Face to face , looking at each other and laying in the sand . " " We had to lie in the sand . If we sat up for a second , some  | couple would plop down in the space we left and we 'd have to sit back to back with strangers . That Sunday was murder . " " But the ocean was there . " " It must have been . I heard it but I did n't see it . All that crowd . " Carl , here 's something I bet you do n't remember : That Sunday when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were waiting for traffic on Broadway and Forty-second Street and Vou said if I really loved you , I 'd give you a great big kiss right there on Broadway in front of all the people ? " " And you did ! Was I embarrassed ! " " Liar ! Now what else ? Let me think a minute , Carl . " He took a moment to think , too . He thought of the dark vestibules of Brooklyn . An evening with her had always excited him physically . The pressing of hands ; sitting thigh to thigh in the movies or the trolley car ; a furtive kiss on a dark street ; a tentative hand on her breast in a dark movie house . The desperation at evening 's end  --  the pulling her into a dark vestibule to hold her in a passionate embrace  --  always on edge lest someone would go into or come out of the house . He shook his head from side to side , thinking of it . " What are you thinking about , Carl ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place we could be alone together . All our love-making in public : On the street ; in subways , trolley cars , movies , vestibules ... . Always like animals looking for a dark corner ... " " But we were n't the only ones , Carl . It was that way with everybody . Even older people who looked at us in a funny way when we kissed on the street : They used to do the same as we did . Only they did n't remember or did n't want to remember . " " No , they do n't do the things we did out here . " " Oh , Carl , all people are human . Even kids . And I bet you the ones out here do as much petting as we did . " " But with a difference , sweetheart . Sure , the same old petting ,  | courting , love-making  --  whatever you want to call it  --  goes on here . But there 's the stadium where they can go nights and be alone in the dark . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can rent a canoe for two . " " Yes , I can see how things would be different in a place like this . Funny ! A person lives one way and he thinks all people live that way because there is no other way . Then he goes away somewhere and sees there are other ways to live . " Another cigarette , another time of silence , then from the stadium a muffled roar . " We must be winning , " he said . " Oh , you mean the game . " " Annie ? " He took her hand in both of his . " Maybe you do n't know what you 're in for . Things could get mighty tough . " " No tougher than I 'm used to , Carl . " " There might be times when we wo n't know where the next meal is coming from . " " Not if I get a job . " " You ca n't count on that . Count on working . Something might come up . " " You mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . I 'd nurse it of course and we would n't need extra money for its food . " " It 's not as simple as that . We must n't have a baby right away , sweetheart . " " But I do n't know how not to have one . " " I asked around . I found out . So I 'll take care of that . I just wanted you to know why we could n't have a baby . " " There 's nothing to worry about , then . I 'll get a job first thing . " " And join the growing list of women putting a husband through college . " " What 's wrong with that ? " " I do n't like it . " " Carl , I 'm used to working . I 've been working four years . And for what ? Nothing . Now I 'll get something out of it . " " You mean I will . I 'll get a law degree . But what will you get out of it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father will be a lawyer . " " But what will you get ? " " I 've already got it . Just to be here in this wonderful place with you . Just to get away from " ? she caught herself before saying , My stepfather ? " where I was . Ah , I 've gotten so much already . " " I hope you 'll never be sorry . " " I 'll never be sorry , Carl . No matter what . " The game was over . People swarmed all over the campus . He got her suitcase and his own stuff from the dorm . She had to carry her own suitcase because he had two of his own and was burdened down with a pair of ice skates hanging over his shoulder and a tennis racket under his arm . That 's a part of him I do n't know , she thought . The way he skates good enough to win a silver cup and runs fast enough to get a medal and that Japanese boy from Hawaii he plays tennis with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his life . Imagine me playing tennis ! Why , I ca n't even play ping-pong ! Annie was impressed with the house , especially the wide porch which looked like a living room to her with its wicker chairs and table . And there was a wooden swing hanging from chains . They set their stuff down on the porch and he took her in his arms . " In five minutes , " he whispered , " we 'll be in bed together . Give me a good , hard , long kiss to tide me over . " She did . But it was not to be . The landlady was very nice about it , but what could she do ? she asked . The room was rented for the day and it was still day . Yes , she could see that Mrs. Brown was very tired . Would Mrs. Brown care to rest on the landlady 's bed ? Annie shook her head , no , and Carl said they 'd wait . Well , they were welcome to wait in the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had a cake to ice . Ill at ease , they sat apart on the sofa . He lit a cigarette , but  | Annie pointed out that there were no ashtrays around and maybe the landlady did n't like people to smoke in the room . They went out on the porch and sat in the swing . Adjusting herself to sit close to Carl , she started the swing to swaying . This irritated him . " Do n't swing , damn it ! " he said . He was instantly sorry . " Do n't mind me , sweetheart . " " I know how you feel , Carl , because I feel the same way . " " You do n't know and you do n't feel the same . You ca n't know how a man feels . A woman can bide her time and wait . But a man ... Me ! All keyed up waiting ... waiting all day .. . waiting years . It 's enough to drive a man crazy ! " " I know . Carl , I 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . " She started to leave the swing . " Like hell you will ! " " Do n't holler at me , now , " she said . " It 's not my fault . " He grabbed her roughly and almost pulled her on top of him . He kissed her eyes , her ears , her mouth and the hollow at the base of her neck . He shoved his hand down her blouse and took hold of one of her breasts . " No , Carl ! Do n't ! " " Let me , " he begged . " No ! People are passing and any minute the landlady might come out . " " Back home , you did n't care how many people passed ; who came in or out of a vestibule . What 's so different about this place ? " " It 's more open  --  got more air , " she said inanely . The silly remark infuriated him . Fury , added to sexual frustration , made him wild . He grabbed the top of her blouse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spattered on the floor . When he began pulling off her jacket , she opened her mouth to scream , but he got his hand over her mouth just in time . She put her two hands flat on his chest and shoved him out of the swing . He stood before her and the swing , on the rebound , clipped his  | knees . He felt like murdering somebody . She started to cry then ? great gulping sobs . It was the last straw . " God damn it ! " he said , his teeth tight together . " I 'm going to settle this once and for all ! " He stamped into the house . Annie sat in the crazily rocking swing , tears running down her face as her trembling fingers tried to button her suit jacket over her exposed breasts . Her hat had fallen off in the scuffle . Standing up to get it made the swing rebound and it banged her square in the backside , forcing her down on her knees . The indignity of it was too much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl came out of the house whistling happily because the landlady had told him she had explained their situation to the men in the room and they 'd been very nice about it and were getting ready to leave and Carl and Annie could have the room in about fifteen minutes . His happy whistling went off into a long whistle of surprise when he saw Annie , kneeling on the floor , her hat on backwards , her jacket buttoned awry , dirty tear streaks on her cheeks , and her arm over her mouth to stifle her wild laughter . " Cry-sake , Annie ! What happened ? " " The swing hit me ! " He got her to her feet , buttoned her jacket properly , set her hat on straight , dusted off her skirt and mopped at her face with his handkerchief , all the while castigating himself . He did n't know what had got into him , he told her  --  acting that way . He was a pig , a dog , a louse , and even a son-of-a-bitch . And hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave him but he hoped she would n't . " No use running yourself down , Carl , " she said in a tired voice . " It does n't help . " " But it makes me feel better . " She gave him a long look , then turned her head away , saying nothing . She said nothing all the way to the lunchroom where he took  | her for a sandwich and coffee while waiting for the room to be made ready . She said nothing all through their little supper . He knew she was very angry and was thinking things out and when she had them all thought out she 'd give it to him . He did n't enjoy his supper , anticipating it . She drank the last of her coffee and folded her paper napkin as carefully as she 'd fold a damask one . " Carl ? " " Yes , my sweetheart . " He took her hand . She pulled it away . " Ah , do n't , Annie . Do n't ! Do n't be mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so much . " " Carl , I 'm a person . I 'm a person that do n't like to be grabbed in a swing . " He waited for her to continue . " That 's all , " she said . He was relieved that it was n't worse . " I 'll remember , " he said . " Also remember never to come grabbing at me any time , any place . " " I 'll remember , " he repeated . She had no more to say to him and was silent on the way home . By the time they got back to the house , it was almost dark . The swing loomed up darkly on the porch . Annie gave it a dirty look . Carl , hoping to make her smile , offered to give it a good swift kick if she said so . She gave him no response . It was a typical student 's room ; larger than most , however , with three windows , a double bed , a study table and chair , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's books which he had carried over the day before . There was a dresser with a mirror . Carl called her attention to a little iced wedding cake and two plates and a knife , sitting on the dresser . Annie broke her silence . She clasped her hands and looked up at him with shining eyes . " Oh , Carl ! You did n't ! " " No . I wish I had . The landlady made it for us . She said a wedding was n't a wedding without a cake . You know , Annie , I went into that kitchen meaning to give her hell because the room  | was n't ready ? But what does she do but show me the cake she had made for us . It sure took the wind out of my sails . Let 's have u piece . " He gave her the knife . " You cut it . " " Put your hand on mine while I cut it . That 's how people do . I saw it in a movie about a wedding at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she cut two pieces and put each on a plate . Well , it was n't a tiered cake and there was n't a sword to cut it with and Carl wore no uniform and she was n't wearing a bouffante white dress and an heirloom veil , but it was a wonderful cake just the same . Annie ate two pieces and then licked her fingers , one by one . She looked around for a towel or something to wipe them on . Carl let her wipe them on his shirt . It was dirty anyhow , he said . " What 's her name ? " she asked . " The landlady ? Mrs. Hansmon . " " I 'll be right back . " The landlady was in the kitchen  --  putting it to bed , she said . Annie was reminded of her dead father , who had been a printer . I Ie used to talk about putting the paper to bed . " I came down to thank you for the cake , Mrs. Hansmon . " " Oh , that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll remember it all my life . " " Pshaw ! Only a little cake . The room all right ? " " just grand ! " " Well , if you ever need anything ... " " And if I can ever do anything for you in return for the cake .. " " Why , thank you , Mrs. Brown . " " People what I like , well , I like them to call me Annie . " " Annie , then . You 're a nice girl , Annie , and you 've got a nice husband . " I know . " The landlady put her hand on the light string and waited for Annie to leave . " Mrs. Hansmon ? "  | " Yes , Annie ? " " Could I ask you a personal question ? " " Well , " hedged the landlady , certain that Annie was . going to ask about contraceptives , " that depends . " " I just want to ask do you understand the way I talk ? " " Why , naturally . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good night . " Annie ran back up the stairs . She 's a real nice girl , thought the landlady as she gave the light string a jerk . But kind of strange . Carl , stripped to the waist , was pacing the floor . He had pulled down the shades , turned back the bedspread , and his pajamas , a new pair , were on the bed . Annie rushed in and started to describe her visit with Mrs. Hansmon . He would n't let her talk . He took her in his arms and kissed her urgently . " Let me at least take my hat off , " she said . " Oh , Annie , please do n't stall . I 've been waiting all day ! " She started to unbutton her coat . She swayed a little . " I guess I 'm kind of dizzy , " she said . " You poor little thing ! You 're about out on your feet . Sit in the rocker and I 'll take your shoes off . " She sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling through her skirt , got her garters unfastened . He pulled off her silk stockings . " Such little feet to do so much walking , " he murmured as he rubbed them . " Could you stand up for a minute , Annie , and let me take your jacket off ? " She stood up . " I want to do it myself . " She turned her back to him and started to undo the buttons . He felt sorry for her and decided to give her a little break . " Look , Annie . I 'll go take a shower and undress in the bathroom and give you a chance to get ready for bed all by yourself . Okay ? " " All right . And thanks , Carl . " When he got back wearing his new pajamas , she was standing  | in the middle of the room , toothbrush in one hand , tin of tooth powder in the other . She was wearing her new white nightgown and robe . He put his arms around her . She stood rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you love me any more ? " " I 've got to wash my teeth . " " Later . " " Now ! " she said stubbornly . He grabbed the knot of coiled hair at the nape of her neck , pulled her head back roughly and put a bruising kiss on her slightly opened mouth . With all her strength , she pushed him away from her . " Oh , stop this nonsense , Annie . " " I told you not to grab at me . And I 'm not going to sleep with you . " " But we 're married now , sweetheart . " " I 'm still not going to sleep with you . " " Why ? Tell me . " " Because you 'll hurt me . I know it . " " Go wash your teeth , sweetheart , " he said quietly . She left . He wondered what in hell had gone wrong ? Everything , he answered himself . She had gone through too much . And why , oh , why had he started that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a baby right away ? That could have waited . And worst of all , the way he 'd lost his head in that damned swing ! The swing did it , he decided . Scared her to death . But was it especially the swing ? Could it be that in all their years of embracing , kissing , touching , discussing sex often and thoroughly , she had been conditioned into feeling that the preliminaries were the whole thing ? And that consummation was n't necessary ? All this clinical analysis knocked most of the desire out of him . When Annie came back , he made no move to go to her . " Go to bed , Annie , " he said . " I wo n't bother you . " But she re- mained standing near the door , still foolishly clutching her toothbrush and powder . He needed a cigarette badly and went to the closet to get one from his coat . At his first move , she started and dropped the tin of powder . " Take it easy , sweetheart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a pang when he heard her sigh of relief . He got a cigarette and remembered the wedding gift he had for her . He brought it out and placed the little box on the dresser . " I bought a wedding present for you and like a dope I forgot to give it to you . " He made a point of going over to the window , away from the dresser , to light his cigarette . " Do n't you want to see what it is ? " he asked . Slowly she went to the dresser and picked up the package . " But I did n't get anything for you , " she said . " Good ! That makes me one up on you . " She opened the box . In it was a thin little gold chain with a golden heart with an infinitesimal diamond chip . " It 's beautiful ! " She went to him and kissed his cheek . " Put it on for me , " she said . She turned her back and he put it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Beautifully cold . " He took her hand . " Annie , will you sit on my lap awhile ? " He felt her stiffen . " I do n't want anything else  --  just to pretend you 're my baby . " She gave him a wary look . " I 've never had a baby , you know . " " I should hope not ! " She smiled a little . " Carl , I should n't have been so mean  --  asking you what you did with all your money . You were saving it for my locket . " " You were n't mean . You acted exactly like a wife , which is as it should be . " She sat on his lap then . " Put your little head on my shoulder and relax , " he said . She snuggled her head against his neck and he rocked with one arm holding her , and with his other hand he patted her backside . After a while of this , she said it felt good . " Want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " I do n't need one . " He thought of what he should say . Finally , he said , " Annie , I may be crude at times , even rough . But ( nnncl-melody . . . " He waited for her to smile . " Mat word , " she said , imitating him , " happens to be proin ninced fun-da-ment-ally . " IIc ventured to give her a big hug . She did not protest . " I:iindamentally , I am not a monster . So do n't be afraid of me . I urn Carl , who loves you . I 'm the guy you married this morning . Remember ? I love you and I would n't hurt you for anything in the world . " " I know . But you frightened me when you grabbed me . And then , I got a little panicky . I never slept with a man before , and I did n't know what I was supposed to do . Because I never slept with a man , " she repeated . " Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , you know what I mean . So I do n't know any more about it than you do . We 'll just have to help each other . " " Carl ! " She sat upright . " You mean you never . . . " " If I had , I would have known better than to just grab you all of a sudden . " " But I thought all men slept around . " " Not all . Not me , anyhow . But do n't tell anyone . They 'll think something 's wrong with me . " " Who do I know to tell ? Besides , I think it 's pretty wonderful that I 'm going to be your first girl  --  that way . " She cuddled closer to him . " Tell me about it , " she said . So he rocked her and patted her and told as much as he knew about the sex act , and she fell asleep in his arms while he was talking . l le looked down at her in her cheap little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought of what hopes and dreams she had chosen them with . She still clutched her new toothbrush in her hand . When he tried to remove it , her hand tightened on it in her sleep . Her hair was in disorder ,  | there were black circles under her eyes . The skin of her eyelids was so thin that the lids looked transparent . Overwhelming tenderness took the place of passion . She is so strong within herself , he thought , but so uncertain outside . But , just the same , she plows into life with both feet . Deep down , she believes in herself , but outwardly she 's full of fear and doubts . She 's so helpless . . . helpless .. . He , too , was drifting off to sleep . However , just before sleep came , he had a cold , clear thought . Later he could n't remember whether he had actually had the thought or had dreamed it . Helpless ? he thought incredulously . Why , that girl could fight a buzz saw ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was awakened by someone pulling his arms . Annie was trying to get him up out of the rocker . " Wake up , Carl , " she said , " and come to bed like a good boy. , , He saw her through a haze . She had bathed , brushed her hair , braided it and tied a white ribbon on each braid . She had discarded her robe and stood before him in her transparent nightgown and she smelled of baby talcum powder . She got him on his feet . He swayed sleepily . She put her arms around him and pretended , with many a grunt , that she was trying to lift him off the floor . " Must I carry you ? " she asked . " I 'm awake now . I 'll walk . " She stood on tiptoe in her bare feet and put little kisses all over his face . " Hurry up ! " she whispered . He took off his pajama jacket and went into the closet to hang it up . From the closet , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you take off your nightgown , sweetheart ? " " It 's already off , " she said .  | Chapter Two Carl did n't have to deliver papers on Sunday , but he did have to work in the cafeteria . When he came home at ten , Annie was still sleeping . He bent down and kissed her . She awakened suddenly , crying out , " Mama ! " " Cry-sake , Annie ! " Carl was startled . " Oh , it 's only you ! " she said in wide-awake relief . " Were you expecting the Sheik of Araby ? " " I forgot I was here . I thought I was in my bed at home . " He had brought her breakfast ; a small Mason jar of coffee and a sweet roll . He had her eat it in bed . She said it made her feel like a rich woman  --  breakfast in bed . Home , she said , her mother would n't let her eat in bed , saying that drew bugs . Carl said his mother used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest a few minutes more . " And how I hated it ! " he said . " She spoiled you . Do n't expect me to . " He hung up his coat and whistled " When My Baby Smiles at Me " as he pulled down the knot of his tie and pulled his shirt up out of his pants . She finished her breakfast and started to get out of bed . " Oh , no , you do n't , Mrs. Brown ! "  | He had to get out of bed at eleven to work the lunch shift . He wanted her to promise to stay there until he returned . She refused . But she did promise to get back into bed when he returned . She bathed and dressed , did up her hair , made the bed , straightened up the room and then there was nothing more to do . She went through the books in the bookcase , but all it held was the dictionary and secondhand volumes of Blackstone 's Commentaries . She read a page and found it dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only could read the stuff , but he understood it , too . Time hung heavy on her hands , and she was so glad when Carl came home that she threw herself at him . " We lost ! " he said dramatically . " Lost what ? " " The game . Yesterday . " " Oh , that ! " " Oh , that , she says , and I had a quarter bet on us winning . " " Serves you right . Gambling ! " He had brought a sandwich and a bottle of milk for her , and the Sunday papers . She thought he looked tired , and she helped him off with his coat . Hanging it in the closet , she was aware of the odor of grease trapped in the tweed fabric . She took a bite of the sandwich , pronounced it good , put it down and went to the bed to fold back the bedspread . She took off her shoes . " Sit down , Annie dear , and eat your lunch first while I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rocker , his hands relaxed on the unopened newspaper . She finished her sandwich and milk . He still had n't looked at the paper . " Are n't you going to read about the game , Carl ? " In a minute . " " You look so tired . " " It 's been a hectic weekend , " he said . She sat at his feet . " Let me take your shoes off , darling . " His heart turned over . She so rarely used a word of endearment.  | She removed his shoes and socks . His feet felt hot to her , and she blew on them to cool them off . He looked down at her . " I love you , Annie , " he said quietly . In answer , she put her arms around his legs and pressed her cheek against them . It was a moment of peace  --  of contentment ? of knowing each other well . They did n't get to read the paper . It was the last day of their honeymoon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see much of each other during the week ; what with his paper route and cafeteria job and classes and law library between classes , he 'd be gone from six in the morning until eight at night . And then he 'd have to study at home until ten . " So you wo n't see much of me , " he said . " Just so I know you 're in the world . " " Will you be lonesome ? " " Just for you . " " Do you miss your mother , Annie ? " " I 'm too worried about what she 'll say about our marriage . " " What about your stepfather ? Miss him ? " " No ! " Her " no " was so explosive that he knew better than to question her further . " Your brothers ? " " I miss them . I used to take them to the movies every Sunday and buy them a cone . Do they miss me ? I wonder . Will they cry when Mama tells them I 've gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll see them again . Maybe they 'll come stay with us at the governor 's mansion . " " You really mean you 'll be governor ? " " Why not ? Dreaming is free in this country . You 'll wear silks and satins , and I 'll buy you diamonds . " " I have all the diamonds I 'll ever want . " She touched the necklace he 'd given her . " Pearls ? " " All I want is a pair of jade earrings . " " What do you know about jade ? "  | " I read a story about a lady spy , and she always wore jade earrings . And the ear than a hole in the head . That 's what I always say . " He took her to the cafeteria for supper . The place was almost a block long , and the front was all plate glass . It was dark except for the long counter in the rear . Rising steam indicated that the food was already in the containers . The counter girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their stations , talking up and down the counters to each other . " Why no customers ? " asked Annie . " It 's not open yet . " " How do the bus boys get in ? " " The help goes through the kitchen . We better go in . We have to eat before the customers come . " They went through a garbage-smelling alley to get to the kitchen . Carl called out a hello everybody as he hung up his coat . The kitchen smelled of hot grease . So that 's why his coat smells that way , thought Annie . The head chef , who practically ran the cafeteria , was sitting alone at a little table , having a bowl of clear soup . He was theatrically immaculate in white pants , apron , jacket , and a towering white chef 's hat . Carl introduced Annie . " Mr. Felix comes from Holland , " explained Carl . Mr. Felix gallantly rose and pulled off his chef 's hat . He had thick white hair , fine and wavy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white goatee to match . He bowed low over Annie 's hand . " I got a sweetheart is just like you , " he said . " She has tea room in Chicago . We work and save our money so we should get married and then we go back to the old country with our money together and live rich there . " " That 's wonderful , " said Annie , " but do n't let us keep you standing , Mr. Felix , while your soup gets cold . "  | " Your girl has the heart for people , " he told Carl . " Now , Annie Brown , you sit and have soup from me . " She looked inquiringly at Carl . Carl pulled out a chair for her . " I go now , " said Mr. Felix , " and get for you and fresh for me . " He took his bowl over to the big black cooking range . " But , Carl , he did n't ask you , " she whispered . " Protocol . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help does not eat with the boss chef . " Mr. Felix came back with two bowls of soup and Carl left . " Soup ! Is all I eat all day , " explained Mr. Felix . " Comes this way : All day I taste the sauce , bite the meat , smell the cauliflower , and pinch the pastry . So I ca n't eat those stuffs . Only soup . " That must be why you have such nice clear skin and pink cheeks , Mr. Felix . " " Not so nice like yours , " he said gallantly . " I wait for you , f Annie Brown . " " Excuse me . " She picked up her spoon . He waited until she took a spoonful before he picked up his spoon . " You like it ? " " It 's good ! " " From turtles , it comes . With sherry wine in . " " It 's very good ! " " You do n't care it 's from turtles ? Some ladies think that is strange to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . You see , where I went to school there were Jewish girls , Italian girls , and we brought our lunch ? sandwiches . Mama made me jelly sandwiches . The Jewish girls had things like fish with stuffing and the Italian girls brought chopped peppers and onion and tomatoes all mixed together and garlic instead of salt , and hard bread so the stuff would n't leak through . And we used to swap sandwiches . That 's how I got to like strange food . "  | " Annie Brown , you are a woman of the world . " Something struck him and he laughed ho ! ho ! ho ! shaking all over like a department store Santa Claus . " I love this turtle soup , Mr. Felix . " " From live turtles comes my soup . In the back room is box with wet grass in . I catch live flies , my turtles should eat . From them comes the soup . Only for me . Not the customers . " " Live flies ? " Annie put her spoon down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said simply . " You would like to see my turtles eat flies I catch ? " " I guess I 'm not woman of the world enough for that , " she said . Again he let out the ho ! ho ! ho ! " Eat your soup , Annie Brown . There is babies in it . " " Baby turtles ? " she said , aghast . No . " He looked around like a conspirator and lowered his voice . " No . But what makes you want to do the thing what makes you get babies . " " Good God ! " she blurted out . Mr. Felix leaned back in his chair with a satisfied , relaxed look on his face . Frantically , Annie looked around for Carl . Carl , who had changed into a white jacket , had been watching them . He had heard the counter girls complain about the dirty things the chef whispered to them . He was at Annie 's side instantly . He pressed her hand indicating that she was not to make a scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands now , Mr. Felix , " he said . Mr. Felix paid no attention to him or to Annie . He did n't even look up when they left . Carl took her out into the alley . He asked what had happened . She told him . A muscle worked in his cheek as he listened . When she had finished , he started for the kitchen . She grabbed his arm . " What are you going to do , Carl ? "  | " I 'm going to take care of the impotent old bastard . " " No ! You might lose your job . " " To hell with my job ! " " And it might get around what he said to me . And I 'd feel ashamed . " He hesitated . " Besides , if you hit him , he might report it to the college and they 'd see only his side of it and you might get kicked out of school . " She had something there . He recalled the interview with the Dean of the Law School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry . The Dean had been against it . Again he heard the Dean say : " The slightest lowering of grades , the merest infraction ... the consequences will be severe . " " Besides , " Annie said , " maybe it was my fault . Mama always said I was too free with strangers . " " Ah , no , Annie . Your mother 's wrong . You 're a friendly , warmhearted girl who likes people . No decent person would take advantage of that . " The cafeteria was about to open , and he had to have his supper now or forfeit it . They went down the counter with their trays , and Carl introduced her to the counter girls , who smiled and wished them luck and the salad girl said may all their troubles be little ones , and everybody laughed . Carl introduced her to his very special friend , who was in charge of the coffee urn at the end of the counter . Mrs. Ridinski was a stout , sweet-faced , middle-aged Polish woman . It was evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Carl , you went and got married on me , " she said , pretending sadness . Carl hung his head in mock shame . " And you said you 'd always be true to me . " She wiped away an imaginary tear . " Her mother held a shotgun on me . What could I do ? " " All fooling aside , Carl , " said Mrs. Ridinski , " she 's a cute little thing . " " At least she thinks so , " said Carl .  | Annie said , " Do n't you believe a word he says , Mrs. Ridinski . " " Too late you tell me , " sighed the woman . " But learn from me , Annie . Do n't let him break your heart , the way he broke my poor heart . " The cashier was banging open rolls of coins and putting nickels , dimes , and quarters into separate compartments of the cash register . Carl put a quarter on the ledge for Annie 's supper . The cashier refused to accept it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Congratulations . " As Carl arranged their food on a little corner table for two , he said , " At least there are some nice people in the world . " They had little to say to each other during the meal ; both , as usual , being very hungry . Carl , a fast eater , finished first . Annie dawdled over her coffee , watching the other four bus boys at a nearby table . Carl pressed her thigh under the table . " What ? " she asked , startled . " Drink your good coffee , Annie Brown , " he said . " There is babies in it . " Annie laughed until the tears came . The counter girls smiled at each other , the bus boys turned around and smiled , and Mrs. Ridinski waved her hand at Carl and Annie . Carl , pleased , smiled at everyone . Suddenly all the lights went on . The counter girls stood at attention , each holding a plate like a soldier holding a rifle at inspection . The doors flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a line snaking down the counter . Then came the first ping of the cash register . The cafeteria was open for business . The other bus boys , who had been hunched over their plates like quarterbacks getting the captain 's signals , now straightened . As if obeying a signal , each boy piled his dirty dishes in a pyramid , marched out to the kitchen with it , and returned trundling a rubber-tired cart . Carl stood up to finish his coffee , made his pyramid and left , saying , " Do n't go away , now , Annie . "  | " I 'll wait till you 're through , Carl . " For two hours she watched him trundle his cart from table to table , clearing remnants of what had been food off the plates , stacking them , collecting the " silverware , " dumping the dregs of rn ( rce cups , slashing left-over water onto the marble tabletop and wiping it dry with a cloth that grew dirtier by the minute . He worked with no expression on his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke to anyone . He was not Carl Brown , newly married husband ; not a student specializing in corporate law . And certainly not a potential governor . He was one of five bus boys working for the privilege of eating .  | She climbed back into bed to read the note Carl had left for her . Mrs. C. Brown , dear madam : I congratulate you on turning out to be a wonderful wife . I am aware of my sagacity in choosing you out of one million and three women anxious to marry me . It was with some anguish I left you this morning . Time will lag ere I see you again . Be so gracious as to meet me in the alley at eight . I crave the boon of strolling home with you . Do not deny me this ecstasy . I am , dearest of dear ones , Yours until Niagara falls . Carl Brown , Esquire She smiled and read the note again . It was fun to receive letters and notes . That reminded her . She 'd write to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write a short note , but poor Annie was like a person possessed when she had a pen in her hand and a blank sheet of paper before her . She wrote and wrote . Was it one hour ? Two ? She began having a headache , lacking breakfast . Hurriedly , she ended the letter .  | Well I wrote enough for now . Here 's a dollar for Freddy and Tommy to share . You tell them I miss them and love them . And do n't forget I love you , Mama , and you got to love me , too , because I was your first born baby . You got to love me even though I ran away from you .. . The donated campus campanile struck the quarter hour . She wondered , a quarter to what ? I must get a clock . Without a clock to make the day into certain times , a day is just a big bowl of mush , she thought . She read the " female wanted " ads in yesterday 's Sunday paper . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two children while mother works . Light housekeeping , mused Annie cynically . I just bet it 's light . There were a few ads for office girl must know shorthand . One ad she tore from the paper . Wanted girl part-time office work . She had a cup of coffee and a doughnut at a little lunchroom around the corner . She phoned from there . A woman answered . " Can you take dictation ? " " No . But ... " " Can you type ? " " No . But I could learn . " " Sorry . " ' Wait ! I learn awful quick . " The woman hung up . Annie went downtown and wrote out an ad for the morning paper . Student 's wife wants office work whole or part time . She gave Mrs. Hansmon 's phone number . Then she went to the bank to have her savings transferred . She had to leave her bankbook there , and the man said it might take a week . She stopped in the dime store to get an ashtray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as the one in the Brooklyn dime store where she had lunched with her friend Arlene . The turkey dinner  --  thin slices of cold turkey meat and mashed potatoes , covered  | with hot gray gravy , the tiny paper cup of cranberry sauce , and the good coffee  --  was the same , too . Yes , it was like being back home in Brooklyn again , except the people pronounced words different . Orange drink , for example . Here they said ore-ranch ; in Brooklyn it was ah-rinch . What made the accent different ? The water they drank ? Because they were n't near the ocean ? The sharper , more pungent air ? What ? She left a nickel tip . Her mother had been against Annie 's tipping . She said Annie liked to show off . Carl was against it , too . He said it degraded the person to whom it was offered and that made Annie feel superior . But Annie knew why she tipped . It made her feel magnificent ! And that feeling was worth a nickel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what she 'd pay for a pack of gum  --  if she chewed gum . She smiled . An elderly woman , passing behind the counter with a tray of upside-down freshly washed cups , smiled back at Annie . They sure are nice and friendly out here in the Middle West , thought Annie . She found a hardware store . " I want a cheap alarm clock , " she said . " Not cheap , cheap . I mean " ? she waited to get the word ? inexpensive . " Our cheapest clock is ninety-eight cents . " " Could I see it ? " The clerk took a clock from a carton , set the time , wound it , and placed it on the counter . The clock ticked hysterically as if delighted at being free of the carton . " Now we have a better clock , " said the clerk . " Costs a little more , but listen ! " He set up the better clock . " Notice the difference ? You can hardly hear it tick . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " if you stood it on a piece of tin like you did the cheap one . I 'll take the ninety-eightcent one . " " That 's up to you . But you 're throwing your money away . " " Why do you have such clocks , then , in your store if you think they 're no good ? "  | He shrugged . " Well , I guess to demonstrate that for a few cents more a customer can get a clock that does n't tick so loud . " " I happen to be a customer , " she said , " that likes a clock that ticks loud . " The clerk started to wrap it . " I want the box , too . It belongs to the clock . " She walked down the street holding the clock to her breast . She suited her steps to the ticking , which made her walk in short , choppy steps . A passing pedestrian gave her a curious look . I better cut it out , she admonished herself , or people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stopped to admire the display in a florist 's window : huge chrysanthemums in black bowls and roses in clear glass vases . Up front , in the middle of the window , was a brass container holding a few sprigs of shiny , orange-red berries centered in open yellow husks . She just had to know the name of those berries . She went into the store . " What can I do for you ? " asked a tall , thin , slightly effeminate young man . " Those berries you got in the window : what 's their name ? " " Bittersweet . " " What a beautiful name ! It suits them so . They grow in yards around here ? " " No . They come from up in the north country . " " Where up north ? " " Oh , past the big lakes ; past . . . You acquainted with the northern part of the state ? " " I just got here two days ago . " " I see . " He cocked his ear as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she explained . " That 's a clock I bought . A nice clock . " " I see , " he said again . " Are you French ? " " No . I 'm Brooklyn . " Before he could say it , she said it . " You see ? " That made him smile , which had been her intention . " What is it like up there where the bittersweet grows ? " " Used to be great lumber country up there . Thousands of  | acres of proud trees . Then came the lumberjacks . " He sighed . " If I could write , I 'd write a book about it . Call it The Rape of the Forests . " " You mean they chopped all the trees down ? " " They did . " " Are they still chopping them down ? " " The murderous ax no longer rings out in the silent forest , " he said dramatically . " Gee ! " she said . " That sounds like a poem . " Encouraged , he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their wake a purgatory of ugly stumps . " " And the stumps still stand there ? " " After a fashion . They were dug up , upended , and arranged close together to form fences . And tenderly , the bittersweet grows over them like God 's own blessing on the miles and miles of gnarled meandering fences . " " Who found the bittersweet and trained it to grow over the upside-down stumps ? " " Well , folklore has it that there was a giant of a man . . . " " I know ! I know ! " she interrupted excitedly . " Paul Bunyan did it . Paul Bunyan and his blue ox , Babe . " The florist looked at her with cold distaste . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " You wanted to say it , did n't you ? " He said nothing . " Of course , I do n't really know . I read about Paul Bunyan once , and I put two and two together . " " I see , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed , feeling that the rapport between them was over . " Not to take up any more of your time , " she said , " how much is a bunch of that bittersweet ? " " Ten cents . " She could hardly believe they were so cheap . " I 'll take a bunch . " While he placed the sprigs on a square of slick green paper , the bottom of which he twisted into a cornucopia , she looked at  | his name printed backwards on the window . " That will be a wonderful book , Mr. Byrd . I mean the one you 're going to write about the forest . " " It was just a passing thought . " " Oh , no ! You must write it , Mr. Byrd . You are a wonderful writer . I know . Just by the way you talk ! " " It is kind of you to say so , " he said formally . Then he broke down . " Do you really think so ? " he asked wistfully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnly . " Thank you . " He looked away from her . " Incidentally , " he said casually , " I 'm driving up to the north country next Sunday . Perhaps you 'd like to come along ? See Paul Bunyan 's country ? " " Oh , I could n't ! You see , " she said proudly , " I 'm married ! " " And , " he said sadly , " I am not . " " Well , good-by . " She put a dime on the counter and went away . It was a long time before he picked up the dime . One more purchase , a pack of cigarettes in case Carl ran out , and she was home . She pulled off her pumps . High heels were not for walking most of the day . She checked the heels . Suppose one broke off ! She 'd be done for . She had no other shoes . Saddle shoes for me , she decided , as soon as my bank account comes here . She washed the Mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to a gleam with tissue from the roll in the bathroom . The bittersweet looked pretty in it . The ashtray went on die study table , where it caught a beam of sun coming in the window . She changed her mind about surprising Carl with the cigarettes . They belonged with the ashtray . But it took the clock to pull everything together . Its ticking made the room come to life . Annie loved the loud ticking . City fired , she was used to sound  --  harmony of sound . The sound of t lie El . Ashcans slammed down at dawn . The chant of the street I a ucksters and the high thin sound of children at play on the street . The ticking of the clock made her feel just right .  | There was a glass tray on the dresser holding two water tumblers . It did n't look right . She removed the tumblers and arranged her toilet articles on the tray . A box of talcum powder , a box of face powder . A jar of cold cream and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comb ! Real tortoise shell ! Carl had bought it for her as a birthday present two yeais ago . It had cost all of a dollar ! She held it up to the light . It was like translucent honey with a darker streak running through it . As always , the comb thrilled her . Iler hairbrush , a pink celluloid affair with missing tufts , just did n't belong on the tray with the comb . " Back you go , old baldy , " she said aloud to the brush and dropped it into the drawer . She wondered how the room would look to a stranger . She decided to test it . She went out , closing the door , and walked down the hall , then came back . Hand on doorknob , she took a deep breath , closed her eyes , and walked in . She opened her eyes . The sunbeam on the glass ashtray threw off colored , shimmering glints . The bittersweet , duplicated in the mirror , seemed to fill the room with color . Her makeup things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs spraddled out , its shiny tin sides and honest open face , it seemed like an old friend . Annie sat on the bed , her hands clasped between her knees , and whispered , " It 's beautiful ! It 's just too beautiful ! " Just then , the campus campanile struck two . Annie 's clock showed exactly two ! She stood up in awe . To think , she thought ; just to think ! A little ninety-eight-cent clock tells the exact same time as that million-dollar clock on the campus ! It 's like a miracle . Elation was followed by despair as she noticed a run in one of her stockings . She berated herself for walking around in her stocking feet . Silk stockings were a luxury . She had had two pairs that morning . Now she had a pair and a half . She got out her pad and wrote :  | Things to buy ( 1 ) 2 pair woolen socks . White . Like coeds ( 2 ) Saddle shoes ! ( 3 ) New hairbrush ( ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She prepared for it the way a girl prepares for a party . She bathed and dusted herself with talcum powder ; put on fresh makeup . She changed into her other slip , brassiere , and pair of step-ins . She brushed her hair , annoyed with the defective brush and aware that no matter how she arranged her long hair , she 'd look out of place among the bob-haired coeds . She made another entry on her list : ( 4 ) Get hair bobbed ( Ask Carl first ) She thought it over and crossed out ask-Carl-first . She felt proud walking across the campus . I bet , she thought , no other girl in my old neighborhood ever saw a campus  --  much less walked across one . Then she saw a gray-uniformed man with a big stick coming toward her . She became uneasy . Was she allowed on the campus without Carl ? Would she be chased off because she was not a college student ? As a child , she 'd been chased off the grass in the park ; chased off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street not in her own district by the kids who lived on that street . She got Carl 's library card out of her handbag to show it to the man . But all he was interested in was impaling leaves and papers on the nail at the end of his stick and putting them in a bag he carried . Annie climbed the wide steps and entered the library with the exultant reverence an art lover has entering the Louvre for the first time . She believed what Carl had told her  --  that there were more than a million books in that library . The great vaulted rooms had the same grand smell the oneroom library back there in Brooklyn had had : a mixture of ink ,  | paste , leather , apples and wax ; all dominated by a faint moss scent . She went from room to room , floor to floor , stack to stack , reveling in books , books , books . She loved books . She loved them with her senses and her intellect . The way they smelled and looked ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pages seemed to murmur as she turned them . Everything there is in the world , she thought , is in books . Things that people said and did and the way they thought and acted even from away back . Away back ! Long before Jesus was born , even . Everything that ever happened or could happen or did n't happen is in these books . Everything since the world began . It was like old times to Annie to come upon David Copperfield in the " D " rack . She smiled at the book and said , " Hello , David , " then looked around embarrassed , hoping no one had heard her . She had first read the book when she was twelve . Before that , she had read fairy tales and novels about well-to-do Victorian families and minor classics available in the little neighborhood library . She had found David Copper field there , and it had made a great impact on her . It was the first realistic book about a city that she 'd read up to that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again to see if she still liked it after a lapse of six years . From the " L " rack she took out Babbitt . She had read Main Street , had been impressed by a new kind of writing , and looked forward to reading this book . Her third book was a slim volume of one-act plays . Annie had seen many short plays in vaudeville . She knew of them as " skits . " She had never seen a play in print . Of course there were Shakespeare 's plays , but she considered them poetry . The check-out librarian did not challenge her , as Annie had feared . Annie walked back across the campus , holding the books in her arm and swaying a bit , as she had seen the coeds do . Hap- pily , she believed she might be mistaken for a coed . She had to change her mind when some classes let out . Most of the coeds wore what was almost a uniform : dark pleated skirts , loose pullover sweaters , a string of " pearls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of place in her city clothes . I 'll never be one of them , she thought sadly . I 'll never belong . Nevertheless , on arriving home she made more entries on her list of things to buy . ( 4 ) Dark pleated skirt ( 5 ) Pull-over sweater ( 6 ) String of pearls Then she sat down and read for two hours . Carl was waiting for her outside the cafeteria . He put his arms around her and kissed her , and for the first time she was embarrassed at being kissed in public . As they walked home hand in hand , he asked how she had put in the day . " I bought some things I needed and got three books from the library and I wrote to my mother . " " Is that all ? " " That 's all . And what kind of a day did you have , Carl ? " " Oh , " he said nonchalantly , " I chased my secretary around the desk all afternoon but could n't catch her . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in a hell of a day sitting in class , trying to concentrate on corporate law when I wanted to be home with my wife . " He did n't notice the changes in the room until Annie called his attention to them . He said he thought the room looked different but he did n't know why . Yes , it looked very nice . " I 'm glad you have something to read , " he said . " I 've got to put in a couple of hours of hard labor and I wo n't be much company for you . Folly 's going to throw a quiz at us tomorrow . " " Who 's Folly ? "  | " Prof Folsom . " " Does he get mad when you call him Folly ? " " He does n't know we do . " " Why do you call him that ? " " Because we all like him . " He prepared for the ritual of study in this new place . He checked the table and found it a little unsteady . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put his day 's notes on the table , got a textbook from the bookcase , and sharpened a pencil . " When you get home tomorrow , " she said , " I 'll have your pencils sharpened for you and the table set for studying . " " Oh , if you go into town tomorrow , will you get me a desk blotter ? " " Yes , sir ! Any special color ? " " Green will be fine . " " Anything else ? " " Ca n't think of anything else . Oh ! and thanks for the cigarettes . " He sat down and opened his book . " I wish I could sit next to you and hold your pens . " " What pens ? " " You know . Like Dora in David Copper field ? " " That 's right . I 'd forgotten . So long since I read it . " She hated to relinquish him to his studies . " What 's the test in , Carl ? " " Oh , the quiz ! Torts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But it ca n't be . " " Look it up , sweetheart , like a big girl . " Tort : it said in the dictionary . A wrongful act , injury or damage for which a civil action can be brought . Under that . was the same word with an " e " attached and that meant a small cake . So , thought Annie smugly , I 'm not as dumb as I think I am . She turned to face Carl , but he was holding his pencil and seemed to be waiting . " You study , " she said . " Do n't mind me. "  | " I 'll wait until you get settled , first . " She took the book of oneact plays from the dresser , slipped off her pumps , and sat down in the rocker. $hc read The Valiant , turning the pages very carefully so they would n't rustle . She was immediately absorbed in the play . She c=ame to the part where she knew the boy was the girl 's brother . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Carl banged his hai , cl down on the table . She jumped up , dropping the book . " What is it , Carl ? " she asked , her heart beating fast . " That damned clock ! Ticks so damned loud I might as well be studying in a boiler factory . " She ran to the closet , got her jacket , wrapped the clock in it and put it in the bottom drawer . " Shh , now ! " she whispered to the clock as she closed the drawer . " I should have bought the one that did n't tick so loud , " she said . " But I liked this one better . " " Come here , sweetheart . " She went to him . He put his arm around her waist and she leaned against him . " I 'm sorry I got upset about the clock . But listen , Annie , it 's going to be very hard on you sitting still in this little room nights . But I 've got to study nights . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've , t ; ot to concentrate . I do n't have a retentive memory like you have . I have to memorize everything  --  word for word . " " Not to start a fight , " she said , " but how could you ever study in the dorm all full of boys ? " " I did n't . I studied at the library . I had a carrel there . " He hoped she would n't ask what a carrel was . " What 's a carrel ? " she asked . " I mean aside from being a Christmas song ? " " A carrel , " he said patiently , " is a quiet cubbyhole . " " Thanks . " She kissed the top of his head . " I wo n't bother you any more . I 'll sit on the bed and read . " A few nights later , inspired by the one-act plays she had read , she decided to write a play . First , she planned , I must get a good  | name so I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide but none came up . The thing to do , she decided , is to write the play first and then , whatever it 's about , I will give it that name . Now what 'll I write about ? How about Carl and me ? Not the way we are , but if we were different people living in a differrent way . First I 'll give us different names . After some thought , she decided on Linda and Lance . Now where will I lay it ? This room ? I 'll figure that out later . I 'll write down the conversations first and put the other stuff in after . She began writing a play . LANCE Sit close to me , dearest of dears , while I study torts . ( She sits . ) LINDA Oh , Lance , I wish I could hold pens for you . Like Dora . LANCE Dora ? ( He thinks . ) Ah , yes . Good old David Copperfield . ( He smiles a faraway smile . ) We must read the book again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linda . Once more we 'll walk down Memory Lane with dear old Peggoty and wonderful Macawber and blackhearted Uriah Heep . LINDA Do n't forget , Lance . You have a torts test tomorrow . LANCE ( He corrects her like she asked him to do . ) Quiz . LINDA ( Is grateful like always . ) Thank you , Lance . ( Now while her voice is playful , her intentions are serious . ) Now settle down and study torts like a good boy . ( He studies torts . But the nearness of her ; the scent of her perfume , distracts him . ) ( She feels this. )  | I 'm afraid I distract you , Lance . I 'll go away . ( She gets up . ) LANCE ( I Ie gets in a panic . He jumps up . ) No ! Do n't go away ! Never go away for I could not live without you , my dear one . LINDA ( She makes her voice quiet . ) And I ? I would die without you . LANCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LINDA ( She does so . They get in a passionate embrace . She gets weak but holds on to common sense . ) But your torts ! remember your torts ! LANCE ( His voice is strong . ) To hell with my torts ! To hell with ambition ! To hell with running for governor . You are my ambition . You are my claim to fame and fortune ! ( The embrace gets very passionate now . ) And there Annie was stuck . She did n't know how to go on from there . In real life , she figured , they 'd get undressed and go to bed together . But you could n't do that in a play . Just then the campus campanile struck nine . Annie resumed writing : ( From somewhere a clock chimes the hour . The sound is that of silver bells . The room gets darker and the curtain falls down . ) ACT TWO It is many years later . The place is the governor 's mansion . Linda and Lance are rich now . She wears jade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember the time , long years ago , when you said my clock sounded like a boiler factory ?  | LANCE And how you cried when I cursed it . LINDA ( Quiet voice . ) I never cry . LANCE Ah , you cry , Linda . In your heart you cry . LINDA ( She whispers in awe . ) How wise you are . LANCE Wise ? Ah , no . Stupid , rather . Yes , stupid ! LINDA How can you say that ? You ! The governor of a great state ? LANCE Perhaps I was the youngest man ever to pass the bar examinations . Perhaps I am the youngest governor this or any state ever had . Perhaps I am as stated in the newspapers  --  intelligent , ethical , and against capital punishment . ( He waits before he says : ) But in my heart I 'm stupid . Annie held her breath . A title was coming ! It was still cloudy , but the clouds were breaking up . She waited . . . waited .. . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the one and only title ! Forgetting that Carl was studying , she threw her arms in the air and called out : " I got it , Carl ! The name for my play ! It came to me just like that ! " She snapped her fingers . " The Stupid Heart ! How do you like it ? " Then all hell broke loose . Carl slammed his book shut and shoved it away from him . It fell on the floor and took the ashtray along with it . The ashtray broke in half . " Cry-sake , Annie , ca n't you be still at least five minutes ? " " Cry-sake ! I got to breathe , do n't I ? "  | " I 'm sorry , " he mumbled . That I got to breathe ? " " You know I have to study , Annie . I 'll get kicked out if I do n't keep my grades up . Why are you making it so hard for tune ? " " What was I doing ? Something so terrible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I did n't break it . It fell off the table . " " Never mind ! You did a bad thing to me . I was having fun writing down conversations and then you hollered at me , like I was doing something just terrible . " " Put yourself in my place , Annie . " " Put yourself in mine . I 'm here in a strange place without friends or relatives and I feel I do n't belong here and never will he allowed to belong here . And you do n't care ! " She started for the door . " Where you going , Annie ? " " Never you mind ! " She was gone . He was about to follow her but changed his mind . Since she had n't bothered with a coat , she probably went to chat with the landlady . The room was very quiet with Annie gone  --  so quiet he could hear the muffled tick of the clock in the drawer where she put it every night . He had the whole room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went back to the table and picked up his book and the pieces of ashtray . He picked up the pack of cigarettes she had bought to surprise him . He felt a pang , thinking of her thoughtfulness . He opened his book , then closed it . He found that he did n't want to study now . He wanted Annie . He went over to the bed and picked up and read her manuscript . He could n't help smiling at the stilted dialogue . And yet . .. yet , there was something about her writing . She had written of the other evening  --  not as it had been , but the way it might have been . Something like a fairy tale .  | He sat on the bed , looking down , his hands clasped between his knees , and tried to think things out . He loved Annie . But how could they possibly get along cooped up in one room ? They ought to have a larger place  --  at least two rooms . That would mean higher rent , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't take on any more work without dropping out of school . And as for Annie 's getting a job . . . could n't count on that . The steady jobs were had by the town girls . Self-help coeds had all the part-time jobs . Was it right to have married her ? He came back to that . Everyone had been against it ; no one had been for it . His mother had been against it . You 're too young , she said . She 's a nice girl for all I know , but she 's not for you . Annie 's mother had been against it . Sure she wanted her daughter to marry someday  --  when she had more sense . And let 's have no more silly talk about marrying that Brown fellow , she said . Why , he ca n't even support himself , much less a wife . The Dean of the Law School had been against it  --  was still against it . " Sit down , Brown . " " Thank you , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papers in a folder which had Carl 's name on it . " Your record is good , " said the Dean . " Good grades ; no adverse conduct record . " He closed the folder . " Now what did you wish to see me about , Brown ? " Carl did n't know exactly how to tell him . " There 's a possibility . . . I mean , I am planning . . . " " Financial problems ? " asked the Dean . In a way . " " Considering your good record , I believe a small loan could be arranged . " " Thank you , sir . But I did n't come to see you about that . I am planning to marry . "  | " And drop out of school ? " " No , sir . I plan on getting my degree . " The Dean frowned . " We do not approve of student marriages . " " But , sir , several married students are taking law , or medicine . " " True . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an influx of married students  --  ex-servicemen whose education had been interrupted . A precedent was set . . . . " The Dean paused . " Brown , is there a necessity for your marriage ? " " No , sir . If there were , I would not have asked for this appointaaacnt . I would have dropped out and married . " The Dean seemed pleased with the answer . However , he said , " I-low old are you ? " " Twenty , sir . " Impulsively he added , " I 've known the young lady four years , sir . " The Dean 's eyebrows went up a little . " Let me see . " The Dean opened the folder . " At sixteen you had finished high school . At eighteen you had completed , or I might say accumulated , two years of college credits  --  the minimum number of credits to qualify for admission to third-year law . I take it your parents were not in a financial condition to put you through law school . You are obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . In addition , you wish to take on the responsibility of a wife . Evidently the study of law is a byproduct to you . " " As long as my grades . . . " began Carl . The Dean put up his hand in a stop signal . " Law , " he said , " is more than good grades ; it is more than a profession . Like medicine , it is a dedication . It should come first in a young man 's life . Everything else should be set aside . " " If you will pardon me , sir , " said Carl , " I am not studying for the priesthood . And I think of the law as a dedicated profession rather than a dedication . To try to become a good , successful , and ethical lawyer should be a great thing in a man 's life . But I do n't see why , sir , it should be the whole of his life . " " Well put ! " said the Dean . " Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your major . "  | " Because of the rapidly growing auto industry in the state . Existing statutes and precedents are fast becoming obsolete and ... " " And in short , you wish to make precedent rather than follow it . " " Yes , sir . " " How do you plan to start ? " " Well , first I 'd have to get my diploma and pass the bar exams . " Setting up a practice is not easy . You can not get together a hundred dollars , rent a vacated store , buy a secondhand desk , have a telephone installed , and put a sign in the window , stating : Corporate Law Practiced Here . " " No , sir . " Carl smiled . " I plan to try ' to get accepted as a junior partner in a well-established law firm . " " That is extremely difficult . And even if by some rare chance you could get into such a firm , the salary for the first few years is small  --  I might say almost nonexistent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with responsibilities , such as a wife and perhaps children , have little chance of being accepted . " " I know the worst . I 'll do my best , " said Carl . " Have you reconsidered putting off your marriage until after graduation ? " No , sir . " The Dean threw his hands in the air , shook his head impatiently , and stood up . Carl stood up . " Well , " said the Dean , " I can not expel you for marrying . But you understand that as a married man you will not be considered for a scholarship to get you through next year  --  your last year  --  nor for a tuition loan ? " " Yes , sir . " " Your work will be carefully watched . Also your conduct . The slightest falling off in grades ; the merest infraction . . . the consequences will be quite severe . "  | " I understand , sir . " The Dean walked to the door with Carl . " When do you plan to marry , Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of age then . " The Dean shook his head and sighed deeply . Carl made his usual thank-you speech . The Dean told him he 'd be expected to report once a month ; to consult the secretary as to day and time . Then the Dean did something quite unexpected . He extended his hand and gave Carl a warm handshake . " Good luck , CarI , " he said . " I know how it is . " He lowered his voice . " I , too , married while I was in law school . " He closed the door after Carl . Now , pacing the floor and waiting for Annie to come back , Carl thought over his interview with the Dean . He sure put it on the line , he thought . And he was right . It would be impossible to live on five dollars a week in one room . Even if they could , it would n't work out . Their marriage would be destroyed or he would fail in his courses . Probably both , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career . The sensible thing to do was for Annie to go home and wait out the time until he graduated . They could spend the summer together .. . No ! He had to have Annie with him . All the time . He loved her and wanted to sleep with her . It was as simple as that . Their marriage was perfect as far as sex was concerned . She was a warm , talkative , even naive child during the day and a warm , passionate woman in bed at night . No , he 'd made no mistake about marrying Annie and he would not give her up  --  even for a year . He 'd give up the law first . Maybe he could keep both ! He could drop out of school for a year , get a job over in Herdstone . ( He understood they paid five dollars a day in the auto factories . ) They 'd live simply , save  | their money , and he could return to school the next year . He 'd get a refund on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made up his mind then and there to drop out of school . He had to tell Annie right away . He went downstairs to get her . But the landlady said Annie had n't been with her . In fact , she had n't even seen Annie since the night they had arrived . Carl got upset . Where was she ? She had left without her jacket . Could it be she was walking the cold streets in her thin blouse and skirt ? Why , she might catch her death of cold . . . . He ran upstairs to get his coat in order to go out and find her . She was standing at the dresser , putting her manuscript in the drawer . " Annie ! Where have you been ? " He shook her a little roughly in his relief at her return . " Out , " she said . " I went out so you could study . " He gathered her in his arms , carried her to the rocker and made her sit on his lap . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sweater . " Do n't ever run out again in this kind of weather without a coat . You could have frozen to death . " " Oh , I 'm not a dope . I came home when it got too cold for me . " What I mean to say is , do n't you ever walk out on me again no matter what I say or do . You just try to put up with me . Hear ? " She said nothing . He held her tighter , thinking it made her warmer . He rocked and patted her for a little while . " Do you love me , Annie ? " " I love you , Carl . " " Would you love me if I was a factory worker ? " " Of course . But you 're not a factory worker . You are going to be a lawyer . You got to be a lawyer . I told the children their father 's a lawyer . " " What children ? "  | " The children I 'm going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm the one going to have them . You can watch . " " All joking aside , sweetheart , I 've got to drop out of school . " " Do n't be silly , Carl . Just because we had a little fight ... " " No , Annie . I 've made up my mind . The Dean was right . " " Oh , he was only testing you ; trying to find out if you had enough guts to be a lawyer . " " How do you know ? " " I do n't know how I know . I just know . " " We ca n't make it , Annie . We just ca n't . " " We 'll make it , Carl . " " Please tell me how . " " We 'll take it one day at a time . Get through each day as it comes up and tackle the next when it gets here . " " That would n't work out . " " It 's working out right now . We have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we ? " " Yes , but ... " " Oh , Carl , think of the wonderful days we 've had  --  how nice Mrs. Ridinski was and the cashier . Why , that canceled out Mr. Felix . And Carl . . . Carl darling , think how wonderful it is to be in bed together . Why , that makes up for all the worries . " " Yes , sweetheart , I know . But I 've got to drop out of school ; get a steady job . It will only be for a year . I 'll get back in school . " " You 'll never get back . People never get back to what they left . " He had nothing to say to that . " Carl ? " She waited . He did n't respond . " Carl , look at me ! " He looked down at her face . " Listen ! And listen good ! You leave school and I leave you ! " " No , you would n't , sweetheart . You promised . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , it will be because of me . I 'll know it . And I 'll leave you . I swear it ! " She got off his lap , got her toilet articles and went to the bathroom , to let him think things over alone . When she came back in her noiseless way , he was sitting with  | his arms on the table , his head down on his arms . He jerked his head up when he smelled her talcum powder , hoping she had not seen him that way . " Things are n't as bad as they look , Carl . My savings will be here Monday  --  at the latest . " " You 'll need that for winter clothes , Annie . " " Not all of the seventy-five dollars . There 'll be enough left to get us through until I get a job . " She went to him and pressed his head against her breast . " You do n't really want to drop out of school , do you ? " Suddenly , the place on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't be , she thought . Men just do n't cry . " Oh , what 's the matter , darling ? " she asked . " Nothing , except I 'm happy . " He got up and took her in his arms . " I 'm happy because I 've got you and because I might not have to drop out of school right away . And now I have a feeling that the Dean , as you said , was testing me  --  was not as hard on me as I thought . And ... " " Everything 's all right , " she said . " And let 's go to bed . I 'm so tired . I must have walked miles today  --  to town and back , and at least ten times around the block tonight . " " And wrote a play , " he said , hoping to make her smile . " That did n't make me tired , and I do n't think the walking did , really . It was thinking things out that wore me out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here ! Let me help you , sweetheart . " He took the brush and gave her hair an awkward brush or two , braided her hair into two lumps and wound the ribbons around them as though tying up a package . He put her to bed , carefully tucking the blanket about her . As he was getting his pajamas and shaving things together , he said , " You know , I could give up smoking , save half a dollar or so a week . " " No . You depend so much on a cigarette . You 'd be a nervous wreck without them . But you do n't have to throw them away  | after one puff , Carl . If you smoked them all the way down you would n't have to buy a pack nearly every day . " " I 'll do that , " he said . " Now I 'll be right back . Do n't go away . He washed up and shaved . When he got back , she was sound asleep .  | Chapter Four It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was anxious to know the time . Rather than awaken Carl , she got out of bed , tiptoed to the dresser , knelt down and opened the bottom drawer inch by inch . A voice came out of the darkness . " Some people buy clocks just to hide them . " She jumped a little . " Is that you , Carl ? " " Who else ? Whom are you expecting ? " " You scared me . I thought you were sound asleep . Anyhow , do you have the time ? " " Yes , I have the time . " He threw back the covers and got out of bed . ' Well , why do n't you tell me ? " " You did n't ask me . You asked me if I had the time , that 's all . " " One thing I hate , " she said , " is a wise guy first thing in the morning . The campanile struck six . Annie took her clock to the window where there was some light . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My clock says five to . " " There 's an off-chance your clock is slow . "  | " You 'd be slow , too , if you had to spend the night in the bottom drawer . " " You 're a nut , " he said . " Just call me Hazel . " He groaned . " That gag 's hard to take on an empty stomach . " So they teased each other and laughed and had fun and it seemed as if the night before had never been . She made a deal with him : She 'd walk as far as the print shop where he got his papers , if he 'd sit with her while she had breakfast . They went to the lunchroom around the corner . She had a thick wedge of cheesecake to go with her coffee . " How you can get that down first thing in the morning is beyond me . " " It 's filling . " She pried off a big piece with her spoon . " I ca n't look ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll see you tonight then ? Outside the cafeteria ? " he said . " Okay . " She gave him a good-by kiss . " Good luck in your torts quiz . " " Want to know what quiz means ? " " No . " " So I 'll tell you anyhow . It 's college slang for test and derives from the word inquisition . " " Oh , who cares so early in the morning ? " She started walking backwards away from him . " Good-by for a while , sweetheart . " " Ah , reward ! " she called back with a wave . " That 's French . It means so long . ' " He pretended to lunge at her . " What time you got ? " she asked . He looked at his watch to check . When he looked up , she was gone ; she had turned a corner and disappeared . He had a feeling of loss . It had always been so , the way she had of suddenly vanishing . She 'd walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he turned his back for a second  | to open the door , she 'd be gone . But I know now , he thought , she 'll always come back . I 'll see her again tonight . She 'll be waiting for me . . . He whistled happily as he delivered his papers , tossing each at a house with right good will . He was so happy he did n't quite know how to handle it . The nightmare of dropping out of school was gone ; Annie 'd had no nagging hangover from the night 's quarrel . And the Dean was all right . He strode into the cafeteria with a big grin for everybody and kidded the counter girls as he piled up a big breakfast on his tray . Mrs. Ridinski looked over her shoulder as she drew a cup of coffee for him . " You 're full of beans today , " she said . " Married life must agree with you . " " And how ! You ought to try it sometime , sweetheart . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She laughed as though she had said something very funny . Carl laughed too , and the counter girls smiled . The streets were empty . It was as if everyone was sleeping and Annie was alone in the world . She liked that feeling . It was n't quite seven o'clock in the morning , and Annie decided she would n't go back to the room just yet . She walked over to the campus . That was quiet and empty , too . She sat on what she considered her wedding bench . She could see the library from there and she loved to look at the beautiful building . The sun , still low in the sky , was bright but did n't give much warmth . After all , it was near the end of October . The air smelled of pine needles even though there were no pine trees on the campus . She wondered if the smell came from the north country where new pine trees must be growing to replace the ones that had been felled . Is there a wind from there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She thought of the bittersweet and won- dered whether the florist had started writing The Rape of the Forest . She was aware of the sky . In some places , where there were no buildings , it seemed to touch the ground . Home , she thought , I had to lie on my back on the roof and look up to see as much of the sky as I can see here , sitting down and looking straight ahead . Just to think , she mused , some people are born to this . Before they 're a day old , even , it 's fixed that they live in a place like this ; fixed that they go to college . Carl 's the lucky one . He was n't born to this . But he got here just the same . It was n't fixed that he 'd go to college to learn to be a lawyer . But he 's doing it ! And I 'm lucky , too . I am here . Sitting here . . . going to the library . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour . Suddenly the campus came to life . Students converged from all directions . They came from fraternity houses , sororities , and dormitories ; from private homes , from rented rooms . The boys carried a book or two gripped in a swinging hand , and the girls carried their books in their arms . They walked along , in pairs and in groups . They talked and laughed and raised a hand in greeting and called out " Hi ! " to each other or " What do you say ? " Annie envied their casual ways , which came from bred-in assurance . She envied the way they dressed ; plainly , but expensively . The costly sweaters , the good shoes . She felt out of place in her too obviously styled suit and foolish hat with the nose veil and her tight kid gloves . She thought of her lack of education ; of her wrong use of words ; of her mispronunciation of words she knew ; of her grammar . She knew she did n't belong . She felt that she never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So you remembered to get me a blotter , " said Carl . " I got a new ashtray too . "  | " Here 's a free kiss for being a good girl . " He looked around . " But where are my cigarettes ? " " What did you do with the pack I bought you yesterday ? " " What did you do with the hundred dollars I gave you yester-day ? " " Bought you a pack of cigarettes . Here . " He lit up one immediately . " How 'd you make out in the quiz ? " " A minus . " " What was the minus for ? " " I forgot to dot an i . " " Oh , you ! " She shoved him against the table . He caught the ashtray just in time . " Watch it , kid . " He started to grind out his cigarette in the retrieved ashtray . She grabbed his hand . " Uh , uh , " she said . " You promised to smoke them down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " He straightened the bent cigarette . " Get any calls from your ad ? " " Just one . The man said he needed a part-time office girl . You know , run errands ? Like buying stamps and such ? Putting water in the cooler ? Filing ? A dollar a day . " " Did you take it ? " " Well , he said he had to interview another girl first and he 'd call me tomorrow . " " Do n't count on it , sweetheart . " Carl made preparations to study . " Carl , is it all right with you if I go out for a few minutes ? " " What 's his name ? " " Stop it ! I mean to get something for sandwiches so I do n't have to go out for lunch tomorrow and miss the phone call ? " " All right . But wear your coat this time . " She got her handbag from the drawer and started to put the clock away . " Leave it out , Annie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the damn thing . " He leaned over to check the matchbook under the wobbly table .  | When he looked up , she was gone . She found a little , dimly lighted grocery store a block away . She said , " Good evening and how 's business these days ? " Without looking up , the man said coldly . " Why are you in-terested ? " She reacted instantly to the rebuff . " I 'm not interested . Just nosy . I 'd like . . . " She changed the verb . He was n't worthy of it . " I want a loaf of bread and four slices of that cheese . " No wonder the place is dark and empty , she thought , the way he 's so impolite to customers ! She stopped at a drugstore for a Coke to give Carl a little more time to study by himself . She took her shoes off before she entered their room . But he heard her come in . He reached out and took her hand . " Annie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . I really needed this stuff . " She placed the bread and cheese on the window sill . " Because I just ca n't study if you 're away . " " I 'm here now . And tonight I 'll be quiet . " She was as good as her word . She sat on the bed and started to read Babbitt and was immediately absorbed in the book . She read , he studied . The room was quiet except for the ticking of the clock . A high falsetto voice broke the silence . " Oh , Lance , I wish I could hold pens for you like Dora . " Then a guttural voice : " Ah , no , I 'm not wise I 'm stupid . I got a stupid heart , a stupid liver , stupid kidneys . " It was Carl , reading her manuscript and improvising on her dialogue . She got off the bed . " I do n't think that 's very funny , Carl , " she said coldly . " Hey , look ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible grimace . " Is my faraway smile on straight ? " he asked . " Give me my play back . Please , Carl . " He held it high in the air . " Come and get it ! " " You damn fool ! " She lunged at him and they wrestled across  | the table for the manuscript . In the scuffle , the new ashtray fell to the floor and it , too , broke in half . " You did it this time , " he said . She grabbed the manuscript and started to tear it in half . He held her hand and made her stop . " Ah , sweetheart , do n't destroy it . I did n't mean to make fun of it . It 's cute . Honest . " " It is n't meant to be cute . Now stop acting so silly , Carl , and get back to your torts . " " What torts ? Tell me what torts ? You are my tort ; my one and only tort . The first time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's the tortiest tort in the world . And she 's for me . " Annie could n't help but laugh at that . " You dope , " she said affectionately . " Mister Dope to you . " He grabbed her arm . " Say mister or I 'll pull your arm off . " " All right , Mr. Dope . Now let me go . " He released her . She put the manuscript away in the drawer . Carl sat in the rocker and patted his knee . " Come here , " he said . " No . " " Please , Annie ? " " I said no ! " To the tune of " Melancholy Baby " he improvised : " Come to me , my melancholy tortsie . " Annie could n't resist that . She sang back : " You shut up or we 'll be through . " They went into hysterical laughter and started improvising words to other popular songs of the day . Somehow , they had to give way after the tension of the ' last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their marriage ; about money ; about having a baby . Carl had worried about his quiz ; about Annie and about the possibility of dropping out of school . And Annie had worried because he worried ; because of their ugly first quarrel . She had worried about not  | fitting in  --  about whether she was good enough for Carl . So they had to break down somehow . And they did . They laughed and sang and romped around and acted like a couple of carefree kids . And before they went to bed , they ate up all the cheese and most of the bread .  | It was early morning the next day . Annie 's hat , gloves , and handbag were on the bed . She was prepared to leave for work as soon as the man called . By noon he had not called . Annie made a hurried trip to the grocery store to get some food after giving the landlady instructions in case the telephone rang . The grocer said , " You 're the one wanted to know last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how business is , " said Annie . " I 'll tell you . It 's bad . " " That 's tough , " she said , with what she hoped was a sneer . " I want a glass of currant jelly . " It only comes in jars . " " All right ! Just so you sell it to me . " She paid him , saying , " I do n't know why I come here . " What makes him so grouchy ? she wondered . Well , maybe his wife wo n't sleep with him  --  not that I blame her  --  and he takes it out on the customers . She was halfway through her first jelly sandwich when the phone rang in the hall downstairs . Annie poised at the top of the stairs . Protocol demanded that the landlady answer the phone and summon Annie if the call was for her . Mrs. Hansmon  | seemed to take forever before she came out of the kitchen and then she had to stand in the hallway wiping her hands on her apron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway down the stairs . But it was only the neighbor lady calling about a bake sale . Annie had to have that job . She had worked herself up into thinking that Carl 's law degree depended on her having that job . She tried to hoax the phone into ringing . If I can walk ten times around the room with my eyes shut and not bump into anything , it will ring , she told herself . She walked around with her eyes shut and the phone did not ring . She tried other charms and spells . The phone did not ring . She thought of her office friend Arlene , who had waited for a very special ring . And it had not come . Now she knew how her friend must have suffered , and Annie felt closer to her . Arlene was a sweet , plain-faced , shy girl who had never had a boy friend . The other girls felt sorry for her . One of the girls had a plain , shy brother . She arranged a party in order that Arlene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arlene and the boy sat across the room from each other . He looked at Arlene when she was n't looking , and she looked at him when he was n't looking . At leaving time the boy , probably prodded by his sister , said , " I 'll give you a ring sometime , Arlene . " Arlene was a changed girl when she showed up at the office next day . Her hair was done up in a new becoming way . Her eyes glowed , there was a drift of pink in her cheeks and she was almost pretty . She hummed happily as she filed letters . But as the week passed without the " ring " materializing , Arlene lost her glow , along with her hopes and dreams , and went back to being her old plain , quiet self . Trouble was , thought Annie ; the counted too much on getting that call like I 'm counting on it . But I have to count on it . Carl 's staying in school depends on it .  | The afternoon waned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But hope died hard in her . He 'll call tomorrow , she assured herself . He 's trying out the other girl first , and she wo n't be right for the job and he 'll call me . The next day she went to the store to get an apple to go with her jelly sandwich lunch . " Yesterday , " said the grocer , " you said you wondered why you came here . " " I 'm dying to find out , " she said sarcastically . " I 'll tell you : because it 's handy for you . " " What 's your name ? " she asked . " Why ? " " I like to know the names of people I do n't like . " She took her apple and left . That 'll hold him , she thought . Annie disliked him . In a vague but complicated way she felt it was the grocer 's fault that the man had n't called about the job . Annie was used to people responding to her friendly overtures . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; made her doubt her abilities ; made her lose confidence in herself . She believed her state of mind went on thought waves to the man who had a job to give . The man did n't want an office girl who was not sure of herself . That 's why he had n't phoned . However , the phone did ring just before noon . Annie waited on the top step . " Who ? " asked the landlady . A pause . " I 'll see . " She called up the stairs , " Annie-e-e ? " " Right here ! " The landlady was startled . Annie was right behind her . " For you , Annie , " said the landlady needlessly . She went back to the kitchen . " Hello ? " said Annie brisk and businesslike . " Annie ? " " Oh ! It 's only you , Carl . " " Cry-sake , Annie , you 've got to cut out that only you ' business . It makes me feel odd . " " I thought it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called you : you know I usually play tennis with my Japanese friend on Saturdays ? " " What 's his name ? " Carl told her . It sounded like Horatio Jonesie . " Anyway , he asked me if I wanted to play this coming Saturday afternoon . " " You going to ? " " Well , Saturday we 'll be married a week and I thought we niiglit like to celebrate  --  you and I. I do n't have to play tennis . " " You play , Carl . I 'll come and watch you . " It will be the last time this year . The courts close next week . " " Well , do n't miss it . Where you calling from ? " " ' Ile cafeteria . Love me ? " " Yes . " " Say it . " " I love you . " " Good-by , Linda , my dearest of clears . " He laughed and hung up before she could get in the last word . Well , Annie never did get her phone call . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Annie had never had a letter from her mother . She knew how her mother spoke , but had no idea how she wrote . Her mother lacked education but was by no means illiterate . Like Annie , she was very articulate . Unlike Annie , she never groped for the right word . When she was stuck , she invented a word . Dear Daughter . I write to you , You are bad to run away from home after all the years I , chnunched and sockofissed to bring you up right . But you came up wrong . I plant a pink rose seed and what grows is a dandy line . Yes , that . Now you are married you say . I say what is done is done . Now I tell you this because I am your mother .  | When a baby comes do n't bladder it all over . Keep it dark because it is nobodys business the baby comes before he should come . Then move to new place where nobody knows you so they shouldnt count on their fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tea leaves . I am your mother . So I do not pray that you have all the hard times I had . I pray for you only to get half the hard times your mother had because that is the only way you will ever know how bad it was what you did to your mother . " Do n't put a curse on me , Mama , " Annie whimpered aloud . She read the letter again ; objectively this time . Mama sure knows how to write , thought Annie . Each sentence is a thought ; each thought a paragraph . She got in what is , what was , and what she thinks might be . The letter made Annie feel a sad tenderness toward her mother . She told Carl about it when he got home . She asked him to read the letter . " She is more hurt than angry , " he said . " But , Carl , did she have to wish me hard luck ? " " Nobody has to wish that , Annie . That comes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother soon , Carl . " " God knows what she 'll write . " " She 'll run me down good . " " Oh , you know how mothers are , Annie . " " My mother did n't run you down . " " Your mother did n't even mention my name ! As far as she 's concerned , I 'm dead . " " I hope your mother do n't mention my name . " " Annie , let 's face it . There 's going to be a big fight when Mom 's letter comes . So do n't let 's fight ahead of time . Okay ? " " Okay . " The Japanese brought the letter over Saturday afternoon when he came to pick up Carl for tennis . Annie itched to know what  | Carl 's mother had written . But she had to wait until evening . Carl 's friend called her Mrs. Brown . Annie did not respond , " Call me Annie , " as she did when she wanted to be friends . Carl was disappointed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to like each other . Annie felt ill at ease with the friend . I is English was perfect , and immediately Annie became selfconscious of her own ungrammatical speech . She was unable to take part in the conversation , even though the polite Japanese tried to draw her into the conversation . She sat on a bench and watched them play tennis . She did n't know how the game was scored and she soon lost interest . Also , her neck hurt pivoting from side to side in order to follow the ball back and forth . She was more interested in the girl playing on the adjoining court . The girl was pretty and wore a short white , pleated skirt and loose white sweater . She smiled a lot at her partner and had a way of tossing her head and making her short hair bounce as she smiled . Annie wanted to be like that . She tried tossing her head , but her tightly coiled hair would n't budge . The girl missed a ball and it rolled toward Carl . Carl let his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He extended it with a smile . The girl let him hold it a second while she tossed her head , made her hair bounce , and looked up at Carl . Taking the ball , she made her hair bounce again as she nodded her thanks . Annie decided definitely that she 'd have her hair bobbed as soon as her money came . After the game , Carl suggested that his friend come home with them and have a Coke or something . Annie stood mute . She did not second the invitation . Carl was embarrassed , but the Japanese boy did the tactful thing . He assured them it was a great honor to be invited to their home , but a previous engagement . . . Walking home , Carl said , " You did n't have a good time , did you , sweetheart ? " She admitted she had n't . " Do you want to tell me all about it ? " he asked . She wanted to tell him how inferior and out of place she had  | felt ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit in . But she just could n't run herself down . She said , " It 's just that I 'm not experienced in talking to Japanese people . And I do n't know much about ath-a-letics . " He did not correct her pronunciation . No use adding to her depression . " And I 'm sorry , Carl , I did n't invite him to our place . But my mind was on your mother 's letter waiting there for us . " " Oh , that 's what 's bothering you . " He felt relieved . " And furthermore , " she said out of the blue , " I am going to get my hair bobbed . " Now what brought that on ? " " Never mind . Besides , we 're home now . " She wanted him to read the letter right away . But he hedged . Let him take off his tennis shoes first , and he had to have a shower . " Do all that after you read the letter first . " " Annie , sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And let 's make a little love before we have a big fight over the letter . " " Oh , I 'm not going to start a fight , no matter what she writes . And even if we do have a fight , let 's get it over with so we have time to make up before we go to bed . " A money order fell out of the letter . Annie picked it up . " It 's for ten dollars , Carl ! She ca n't be too mad . " They smiled at each other , Annie sat down and relaxed and Carl read the letter aloud . It started as a routine letter . How was Carl getting along ? Did he need anything like woolen socks for winter ? And everything was fine at home except Papa 's back was giving him a little trouble . That watch she gave him for Christmas : was it all right ? Let Mom know before she made the final payments on it . Then came the gist of the letter . " I 'm surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out there . I do n't know what kind of mother she has to let her do a thing like that . " Annie was on her feet , choking with indignation . " Take it  | easy , sweetheart , " he begged . " Please ! Please ! " " I 'm all right . Go ahead . Read more about what 's wrong with my mother and me . " " If you 're going to act that way , I 'll tear it up without reading the rest . " " Read it ! " " Sit down and be quiet , then . " " Of course , you ca n't be serious about getting married , " read Carl . He realized he was getting into the danger zone and hurriedly scanned the next lines before he read them aloud . " Now do n't be foolish and let anyone talk you into getting married . " I Ie read the next lines to himself . " She 's not so dumb . She 's smart enough to know you got a good future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " said Annie . " What else does she say ? " Carl improvised the next line . " Now Annie is a very nice girl ... " " She did n't say that . You 're making it up . " " All right ! All right , God damn it ! " He tore the letter in half and threw it into the wastebasket . " You should have told her you were married , Carl . " " All right ! I should have told her . I 'll tell her now . " He sat down and started to write a note . " Just write that we were married a week ago , and . . . " " Okay , " he said reasonably . " You write it for me . " He wadded the sheet and threw it into the wastebasket . " Now , you just see here , Carl Brown ! I 'm the one has a right to get mad . Not you . " He wrote the note and gave it to her to read , while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were married last Saturday and we are very happy . I love her very much and she loves me . When you really get to know Annie , you will love her as much as I do . Love to Papa and Tessie and to you , Mom . Carl .  | He waited until she had read it . " All right ? " All right , " she said . " Got a stamp on you ? " She got one from her handbag . " Annie , do you care if I write a P.S. , Love from Annie ? " She thought it over . " No , Carl . She 'll feel bad enough when she gets the news . No use rubbing it in . " He went out to mail the letter . Of course , she got the pieces of letter out of the wastebasket and put them together . She read what Carl had evaded reading ? how the urgency to marry was all on Annie 's side . His mother wanted to know was there a possible pregnancy ? She warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her written words : .. . remember , if she let you , she let other men . So send her home right away . I am sending ten dollars for her fare back home so she do n't have the excuse of no money to get back home on . Annie literally saw red ! She tore the letter to bits and threw it into the wastebasket . She made confetti out of the money order and threw that into the wastebasket . She got her suitcase out of the closet and opened it on the bed . She wrapped her clock in her torn blouse and put that in the suitcase . She added the bittersweet , jar and all . Suddenly , she began to sob  --  loud , hoarse sobs . She ran to the bathroom , locked herself in , turned on the water so no one could hear , and cried herself out . Carl came back carrying an ice-cream cone for Annie . He looked around the empty room . He saw the opened suitcase on the bed . " Annie ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . " Annie , do n't do that ! You must n't always disappear the moment I turn my back . " " I was in the bathroom . " " I brought a cone for you . " " Oh , thanks , Carl . " She took the cone . " You got your suitcase out . You were n't thinking of leaving me ? Just because of a letter ? "  | " Where would I go ? " she said , licking the ice-cream cone . " But I had to do something . You see , I put the letter together and read the rest of it . " " Was it rough , sweetheart ? " " Worse ! It was filthy ! " " Oh , Annie , do n't be too hard on Mom . " " You want me to wire her congratulations or something ? " She threw the unfinished cone into the wastebasket . " Put yourself in her place . " " I 'll do just that . Once she was a young girl like me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to marry her because she was pregnant and had slept with a lot of other men , too . All right ! How do you think your mother would like that ; would have liked it if your father 's mother had acted ... " " Listen , Annie . Your mother said the same thing and you did n't go crazy about it . " " Maybe she thinks I 'm pregnant , but she thinks it 's you ! Only you ! Not a gang . " She went to him and pounded her fists on his chest . " But your mother thinks I slept with everybody . Do you understand ? " ( pound pound ) " Do you ? But I did n't ! I did n't ! " she screamed . " I know , sweetheart . I know . " He took her fists in his hands , held them against his cheek and kissed each little fist . " Do n't make so much of it , Annie . Do n't . Someday you might have a son . If he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at his side of it . I would n't be selfish . " " You 'd react the same way . " They quarreled , they argued , then got down to plain talking . Ca rl admitted his mother had done a rotten thing by writing as she had . Contrary Annie said she did n't know about that . After ill ! , Carl owed something to his parents . " No matter what she does and says now , at least she gave you a wonderful childhood , Carl . " " I do n't know about that , Annie . Yes , she was a good mother ,  | gave me everything I wanted . . . No , gave me what she wanted for me . I wonder more and more as I grow older why she pushed me so hard . " Summers , when other kids were off to the free camp in the Catskills , she had me go to summer school so I could graduate at twelve instead of fourteen . High school too . I made four years in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was cut out for the law . " " But you did like the law , did n't you , Carl ? " " It so happened that I took to it . I was n't sure , though , until I came here . " " I do n't like your mother , Carl , and I never will . But I must say she did an awful lot for you . " " So she told me . Many times . Tessie and Papa told me , too . When I graduated from high school , Tessie happened to say , The next thing you know , Carl will be off and married . And Mom looked at me and said , Not Carl . He 's got sense . He 's going to be a lawyer and help us get a better home life . " " What did you say ? " " I said , Sure . What else could I say ? " " I wish my mother had been like that , " said Annie wistfully . " My mother did n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me . I must be funny or something , but I just loved school . " She thought awhile . " Funny , when I think of it , I ca n't remember having much fun . I never had birthday parties like you ; never was allowed to bring girl friends home . She never said , that 's nice , when I brought home an all-A report card . Come to think of it , I never was a kid . Not really . I went to work when I was fourteen . I passed for sixteen . But I do n't hold anything against Mama . My father was dead and my brothers were so little and Mama and me just had to work . " " Now , Annie , you could have gone to high school when your mother married Dan . You told me . " " Yes . But by that time I did n't want to . I was sixteen . I  | did n't want to go to school with kids of thirteen or fourteen . And then there was Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She paused . " Oh , never mind . Anyhow , I kept on working because that was my independence . " I remember how I walked out on my first job . It was in the second basement of a department store on Fulton Street . One clay I got this queer idea that I was down in the ground  --  way down . Like being dead or something . Yes , underground , with people walking above me all day . So after my lunch hour , I did n't go back . But Mama made me go back . She said I had a weak character and must n't give in to such foolish ideas . " Still and all , I ca n't blame her too much . She wanted me to have character , I guess . To be brave or something . And she had such a hard time after my father died . " And it got dark in the room and they did n't turn on the lights . She sat on his lap and she spoke of her childhood . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and putting f the good pieces in one box and the bad ones in another . He did n't listen very closely , but that was all right . He knew it was good for her to talk out her thoughts whether he listened or not . He had his own thoughts to cope with . Unlike Annie 's , they were of the present and not the past . He thought of his letter arriving and how his mother would n't open it until after supper . ' ( ' hen his mother would say she 'd had a letter from Carl . His mother and father and sister would sit around the cleared table i n the kitchen . And Tessie would say she hoped it was good news and his father would say , it 's always good news just to get a letter from Carl . And his mother would open the letter and read : Annie and I were married . . . And just thinking how they would feel made Carl sad , too .  | " I thought it would never get here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " the bank teller said . " I entered your interest , Mrs. Brown . " " Imagine , " said Annie . " Sixty-eight cents ! For nothing ! I did n't have to do a lick of work to earn it . " " That 's interest for you , " said the teller philosophically . " I want to draw out twenty-five dollars of my own money . But do n't touch the interest . " " The idea is , " he said , " you want the interest to earn interest . " " Why , yes . Is that all right ? " He shrugged . " It 's one way of getting rich , " he said . Annie bought a knee-length , navy-blue , pleated skirt and a sweater to match . The sweater was too loose to suit her . She wanted a tight sweater despite the fashion because she was rather vain of her firm upstanding breasts . " No , no ! " said the horrified saleslady . " It 's not chic to wear tight sweaters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loose sweater . The coat was light brown with a half belt at the back . Annie thought it looked like a boy 's coat . Her eyes went longingly to  | a sleek black coat , with a dyed rabbit collar , on the rack . " I do n't know , " said Annie doubtfully . " Do you think this coat makes me look like a boy ? " " Not with those legs . " " Thank you . " " Well ! " exploded the saleslady . " You sure hate yourself , do n't you ? " But she smiled . " No , I do n't . Do you ? " Again the saleslady was confused . " I do n't have bow legs and I know it . It would be silly to act as though I did , would n't it ? " " I do n't know , " said the saleslady , throwing in the towel . The shoe clerk was small , slight , and a little on the dainty side . Dapper is the word for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a wisp of a mustache . His shirt cuffs extended a couple of inches outside his coat sleeves and his cuff links were dramatic , literally so ; one being the Mask of Comedy and the other the Mask of Tragedy . But his shoes were unshined and run down at the heels . That 's the way it is , thought Annie . Man that sells shoes ca n't bother with his own shoes  --  like a writer ca n't bother with spelling . Like me . She looked down at the new saddle shoes on her feet . She had never seen white leather before , and it looked like whipped cream to her . And the saddle of shiny brown leather  --  I ca n't stand it , she thought , they are just too beautiful . " I 'll take them , " she said . " In a box . " " Of course , " said the clerk , untying the laces , " they 'll look much better when they 're dirtied up a wee bit . " " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But you must , dear , " he said , his voice going up on the must . " Clean saddle shoes are considered gauche on campus . " She had never heard the strange word , but she had an inkling of what it meant . " You mean , like icky ? "  | He did n't know what icky meant but had too much poise to reveal his ignorance . " Why not ? " he said debonairly . Her next stop was the barbershop . " How do you want it cut ? " asked the barber . " So that it bounces , " said Annie . " You mean when it falls on the floor , it should bounce ? " " No . On my head when it 's short . " " You mean a Dutch cut ? " " If that 's what you call it , " she said dubiously . She was a prisoner under the voluminous sheet . The barber flexed his shears and waved his comb as if preparing for an attack . She closed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first hank of hair left her head and fell to the floor . It had taken all her life , so far , to grow it and now it was gone . " You can open your eyes now . It 's done , " he said , like a dentist after an extraction . Before opening her eyes , Annie tossed her head to feel if her hair bounced . It did ! She sighed happily . The cutting was worth it , no matter how it looked . She opened her eyes . Her head looked strange but not too bad . The barber removed the sheet , shook it out and put it back around her . He put talcum powder on the nape of her neck and dusted it with a soft brush . That was nice . He sprinkled sweet-smelling lotion on her hair and rubbed it in hard . That was even nicer . He combed her hair and little curls formed at the ends and that was the nicest of all . The barber picked up the shorn hair from the floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want this , do you ? " he asked . " I certainly do ! " " What are you going to do with it ? " " I do n't know . I just want it . " He shrugged . " You 're the boss . " He put it in a paper sack . She paid for the haircut and gave him a nickel tip . He looked at it in the palm of his hand and said , " Sure you can spare it ? " " No , I ca n't , " she said . " But that 's the right thing to do . " He smiled , thanked her , and told her to come back soon .  | She heard Carl coming up the stairs . She posed , in her new outfit , her back to the dresser mirror . As he opened the door , she tossed her head to make her hair bounce . Carl took one look . " Oops ! " he said . " Wrong house . Excuse me . " He went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come back , Carl . Come back ! " He came back and looked her over . " Can you tell me what 's become of a girl I knew , Annie Brown ? " " I am she ! " she said dramatically . " Well , Miss Shee , where is your hair ? " " In the bag . See ? " She showed him . " And your bust : Where 's that ? In another bag ? " " Oh , I still got that . " " Let 's see . " He pulled up the front of her loose sweater . " You stop that , now ! " She slapped his hands away . " Just wanted to see if you were all there . " " You never noticed my new shoes . " " I did . First thing . But there 's a smudge on the left one . " " I dirtied it on purpose . Clean shoes are not in style . " " It 's all over my head . " He hung up his coat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pencil . " You did n't say how I looked in my new clothes , " she said sadly . " You look beautiful in your new clothes . You looked beautiful in your old clothes . But you look most beautiful in no clothes . " I Ic dropped the pencil on the table . " Sit on my lap a second , sweetheart . " " Later , Carl . You got to study and I got to go to the store . " " You do n't got to go ' any place and you know it . You just want  | to show off your new outfit . " " Is that a crime or something ? " she asked . Annie was sure the grocer would n't recognize her . Without looking up , he said , " Last time you were here , you asked me my name . " I want a box of soda crackers , " she said . " Well , my name is Henry . " " And a box of fig newtons if they 're fresh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll let you know some other time , " she said . She stopped at the drugstore to get Carl a pack of cigarettes and to treat herself to a Coke . Sipping it , she thought of the grocer . She had grown used to his rudeness . In fact , she rather enjoyed the relationship between them . She had asked the landlady and found out that he lived alone . His only son had been killed in the Argonne fighting and his wife had died some years ago . And he was getting old , in his sixties , the landlady had surmised . Annie had a sudden flash of revelation . That 's why , she thought , he acts that way . Because he do n't want anybody to know he 's lonesome and to feel sorry for him ! She went back to the grocery store . It was in darkness , save for the light over the cash register . He was counting his money . She opened the door and stuck her head in . " Hey ! " she called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without looking up . " My name 's Annie Brown , " she said , then added , " Henry . " She scuttled away . Without looking up from his textbook , Carl patted her hand in thanks when she put the cigarettes on the edge of his study table . She climbed up on the bed with pad , pencil , and This  | Side of Paradise . But she was too excited to read . She thought of the new people she had come in contact with since her marriage . She decided to list them . She wrote a heading : " New People Who Have Entered My Life . " She listed them under subtitles . New Friends Mrs. Hansmon  --  Landlady Mrs. Ridinski  --  Cafeteria Mr. Byrd  --  Florist &; Writer Henry  --  Grocery-store man Enemies Mr. Felix  --  Turtle Soup People I Know to Speak to Cashier Lunchroom  --  Female Waitress Dime Store Where I Bought Clock  --  Man Man in Bank Saleslady  --  Dress Store Shoe Store Man . Also Barber Drug Store  --  Cig . Man &; Coke Boy College &; Campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under that heading had so much as spoken to her . She thought of Carl 's tennis friend . He 's campus , she decided . She wrote down : Japanese Student . She tore off the sheet and held it at arm 's length . " Not bad , " she said aloud , " seeing I 've only been here a short while . " Then , realizing she had spoken aloud while Carl was studying , she braced herself for his battle cry of " Cry-sake , Annie ! " But the room remained quiet . She stole a look at him . He was absorbed in his book , but he was smiling . She gave a happy  | sigh , thinking , We 're getting along good now , Carl and me . It 's what people call adjustment . The letter came for Carl . His sister , Tessie , had written it ? typed it in her office . It was cold and precise . Your news came as a great shock to us . Mother almost had to have the doctor and Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the circumstances , you can not expect us to subsidize you any further . Also we want you to pay back all the money we advanced you last year and to date . " Advance , Carl ? I thought they gave it to you . " He made no comment . The letter continued : I enclose a list of what you owe us . Also if you want to keep the watch Mother gave you for Christmas , you 'll have to make the last two payments due on it . Too bad you have to leave college after you 've gone this far . " But , Carl , you did n't tell them you were going to drop out of school , did you ? " " No , no ! " he said impatiently . He looked at the list . He owed four hundred fifty dollars . The jeweler 's slip indicated that there were two more payments , two dollars each , due on the watch . He sat down and worked the palm of his hand back and forth on his forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Carl . We 'll send her that right away . " " Do n't say anything for a while , Annie . Just do n't say anything . Let me think this out . " " All right . " She went down the hall to the bathroom so that he could be alone . When she came back , he was pacing the floor and pulling hard on a cigarette . There was a vertical line on his forehead between his eyes . She had n't noticed that before . " There 's just one way out , Annie . " " Carl , I will not let you leave . . . "  | He put his hands on her shoulders . " I am not going to drop out of school . And you 're not going to contribute your fifty dollars . " " I 'll get some kind of a ... " " And you will not get a job doing housework . I 'm going to give Mom a note , payable over a period of five years at six per cent interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Payments to start one year after graduation . " " But she might get mad . Oh , Carl , suppose she sues us ? " " She wo n't . You stop worrying now and leave everything to me . " He sat down and drafted the note . The next day , they went into town together . He had the public stenographer at the hotel type the note and notarize their signatures . He had to ask Annie for fifty cents to pay the girl . He sent the note to his mother , registered mail . Annie thought of the ten-dollar money order she had destroyed and wanted to send the money from her bank account . But Carl had included that in the note . Carl pawned his wrist watch for seven dollars and sent off a four-dollar money order to the jeweler , requesting a paid-in-full receipt . t " Damned watch  --  paid for now , " he said . " If I ever catch you buying anything on time . . . " " It 's funny , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get it ? " " It 's funny having a watch all paid for and not owning it . Get it ? " " I 'll tell you something even funnier . Married less than a month and already over four hundred dollars in debt . Just get that . " " Oh , to hell with it , " he said . " The hell with it , " she agreed . They had lunch in the restaurant where they had had their wedding lunch . They had the fifty-cent lunch this time . Carl took Annie to the College Shop after lunch to buy her a wool  | scarf . It was made of soft wool in the college colors . It cost a dollar and a half . The clerk showed Annie how to wear it ; wound once around her neck ; one end hanging down her back and the other in front . He showed how it could be used as a hood by pulling up the back part over her head . He made quite a production of it , smoothing her hair under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pat on her cheek . " That 's just about enough , " said Carl . He paid the man and they left the store . Annie poked her elbow into Carl 's ribs and said , " Jealous ? " " Who gave you that idea ? " " You . " " Do n't be silly . " She sang a few bars of a song . She sang off-key . I 'm jealous of the pretty flowers , too . I miss the kiss they always get from you .. . " Must you sing on the street ? " he asked . " Yes ! " " Sing out loud and clear , then . " " Oh , Carl ! " she hugged his arm . " I 'm glad I got you . " " You little nut ! " He smiled down at her upturned face . And many an older person , passing them on the street , sighed and smiled and thought how wonderful it must be to be young and not have a care in the world ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His interview with the Dean came up , but after he had braced himself for an ordeal , the Dean canceled the appointment  --  put it off two weeks . Carl worried . Now what ? worried Carl . Had his mother written the Dean , in some way berating the man for not preventing the marriage ? Was the Dean waiting to make up his mind about expelling him ? He had something else to worry about when he came home  | that night . The room was dark . " Annie ? " he called tentatively . No answer . He had a clutch of fear . How long had she been gone ? Where was she ? He switched on the light . She was lying on the bed , fully dressed except for her shoes . She had a folded wet towel on her forehead . She pulled it off and got off the bed . " What 's the matter , Annie ? What 's the matter , sweetheart ? " " Nothing . I just feel terrible , that 's all . " He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icy cold . " You get back into bed , " he said , " and cover up good . I 'll help you undress . " He started to pull off her sweater . " Do n't touch me ! " she said sharply . " Cry-sake , Annie . " He stepped back in astonishment . " Now , I 'm not mad at you , Carl , or anything like that , " she said . " It 's just that I feel like glass  --  that I 'll break in pieces if anybody so much as touches me . " She undressed , got into bed , and pulled the blanket around her . Anxious to do something for her , Carl took off his coat and started to tuck it around her . " Take that coat away , " she said irritably . " That grease smell puts me in mind of Mr. Felix . " Flanging it in the closet , Carl thought that it ought to be cleaned , but he wondered what he 'd wear while it was at the cleaner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . I do n't want supper . Just a cup of tea . " " I 'll get it . " Mrs. Hansmon was in her kitchen . " I do n't know how to ask you , Mrs. Hansmon , " said Carl , " but Annie  --  well , she does n't feel well and she wants a cup of tea and . . . " " Sit down , Mr. Brown . You 're the one who looks sick . " He sat at her kitchen table while she put the kettle on to boil and arranged a cup , saucer , and little brown teapot on the tray . " It 's turning cold , " she said . " Would n't surprise me if we had snow . " Snow ? " he asked vaguely .  | She poured the boiling water into the teapot and put an aspirin on the tray . " Make her swallow it , " she said . " It may not do her much good , but it wo n't do any harm . " Carl got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to thank you , " he said . If I can pay in some way . . . " " Well , if you 're still here in the spring , maybe you 'd help me get the screens up ? " " That would suit me fine , " he said fervently . " Here ! " She gave him a hot-water bottle which she had filled with water from the kettle . " What 's that for ? " he asked . " Annie will know . " As he was leaving , she said , " How old are you , Mr. Brown ? " " Twenty , " he said . She shook her head and smiled ruefully . Annie appreciated the hot tea , took the aspirin , and was grateful for the hot-water bottle . When she had finished , he put the tray on the dresser and sat on the edge of the bed . " Do n't let me keep you from your studies , " she said , as though they were strangers . " Never mind my studies . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Carl , " she said petulantly , " go away and study , will you ? " Worried , and hurt too , he went through his prestudy ritual ; checking the matchbook under the wobbly table leg , arranging his textbook and pad , and sharpening his pencils . " Do you think we ought to get a doctor ? " he asked anxiously . " Let me alone , will you ? " she said in a high strained voice and turned on her side , her face to the wall . He tried his best to study , but torts had no meaning for him . He tried to make notes and made doodles instead . He fought down the urge to smoke a cigarette , fearing the smoke would bother her . She was so quiet he wondered whether she was  | asleep . He listened for her breathing , but could n't hear it over the clock 's ticking . He went to the bed and leaned over to listen . She was asleep and breathing rhythmically . He undressed in the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , he put his hand on the light switch , hoping the click would n't awaken her . Carefully , he got into the bed , lying on the extreme edge with a good many inches between them . She turned over and touched him . " Hold my hand , darling , " she said . " Just my hand . " He took it in both his , relieved that now her hand was warm . " Do you get these spells often , sweetheart ? " he said . " Every month , " she said wearily . " Every twenty-eight days . " Ile said nothing . " Did n't you know , Carl ? " " No , I did n't . I should have known but I did n't . I 'm just plain stupid , I guess . No wonder the landlady asked me how old I was . " " I do n't know why it comes so hard for me , " she said fretfully . " I 'm so healthy otherwise . And I get so cranky , then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl . " " You 're fine , " he said . " Just fine . And you be just as cranky as you want . " " And I 'm sorry , Carl , that for a few nights we ca n't ? " " Hush ! " he interrupted . " That 's all right . Everything 's all right . Just so you 're here nights when I come home . " " Just so you come home nights , " she murmured . He held her hand until she drifted off to sleep . He lay awake a long time , enjoying the relief he felt knowing that she was not pregnant . Then he felt ashamed of his relief . It should n't have to be that way , he thought . No . It should n't have to be that way .  | It was a Tuesday in November and there was a " closed " sign on Henry 's grocery store . There was a burlap sack outside , which had been rolled down to make half a sack . It was full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of squirrels coming around the corner , taking a nut from the sack and then disappearing . It looked like an assembly line . Annie rushed across the street and dispersed them . The little things broke their line and scattered in disorderly retreat , bumping into each other . Henry came out of the store and asked Annie what in heaven she was doing . A favor , she said . The squirrels were stealing all the nuts and she chased them away . " But , Annie , I put them there to let the squirrels steal them . Once a year . On my birthday I close the store so people wo n't bother them . " " Your birthday , Henry ? " " Sixty-one today . " " You certainly do n't look it ! " Of course he looked it . He knew it and Annie knew it . But it was a nice thing to say  --  that he did n't look it . Now the squirrels were sitting in a crooked line across the  | street , their eyes on the nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defiantly took a nut and ran away . The others took heart when he returned unharmed and started up the assenihly line again . " Watch ! " said Henry . He took a nut , crouched clown and held it at arm 's length . A squirrel snatched it like a flash . Annie tried it . A little squirrel sat on his haunches , his paws crossed , his nose twitching and his tail quivering . Finally , trembling all over , he snatched the nut , stashed it away in his cheek and was off . Annie was thrilled beyond words . As she continued serving the squirrels , Henry told her he had been giving them this treat for eleven years . " Ever since I was fifty , " he said . " And you know , Annie , they know exactly the day to come . They never miss it . There used to be hundreds but now only a handful come . " " What happened to the others , Henry ? " " Well , as the town grew and houses got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make more house space , most of them went out of town to the woods . Each year they are fewer . " Know what , Henry ? You are a very good person . " " No . It 's just that I figure somebody  --  something will miss me after I 'm gone . " He told her how years ago his birthday party for the squirrels had been a big thing . The newspapers wrote it up and took pictures . One was half a page . And there was something in it about his dead son ; how brave he had been in the war . He still had the paper . " I 'd love to see it , " said Annie . " Maybe I 'll let you see it sometime and maybe I wo n't , " he said . Annie smiled . Annie in her conforming outfit felt at ease on the campus . She managed to be on campus when classes let out . She carried  | her books and mingled with the students and pretended she belonged . She smiled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at no one or anyone . A coed in the crowd , evidently mistaking Annie for someone she knew , waved back . Encouraged , Annie took the next step . She joined a group of students and walked into Casson Hall with them as if she had a class there . She leaned over the water fountain and took a spurt of water , surprised that it tasted like any other water . With a businesslike frown , she checked the bulletin board . There was a notice stating the deadline of a short-story contest . Someone had a room to let . Someone wanted to sell a camera , slightly used , and someone wanted to buy a typewriter  --  must be cheap . Someone had lost a galosh , left foot , male . Someone had found a glove and thumbtacked it to the board . Down in the corner was a personal note : Nancy meet me at 3 , Liva 's Sweet Shop . Ed . Under it in various handwritings were : I 'll be there . Doug Fairbanks . And under that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll be there , Nancy . Sig Freud . Absorbed in the board , Annie had not noticed that the students had dispersed to their various classes . She was alone in the empty hall . On the way out she stopped to listen to a class in session . The door was open , she stood against the wall to listen . " ... naturalism is just another word for realism . " " Class ? " The teacher 's voice was a question mark . " You have your hand up , Mr. Boyton ? " " They are two different things . " " Explain . " Two different things . That 's all . " " Miss Decoe ? I see your hand . " " Well , realism is naturalism boiled down . " " You mean it 's the dregs of realism ? " The class laughed . Annie laughed , too , her hand over her  | mouth . She did n't think it was funny , but she wanted so badly to belong . She heard a boy 's deep voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder and sex . " A boy with a higher voice pitched in . " Naturalism has sex too . Maybe the sex is more natural than real . But . . . " " We 're getting off the subject , " said the teacher . " May I say something ? " It was a girl 's voice . " Yes , Miss Downing ? " " Realism is short sentences and few adjectives . Naturalism , the sentences are long and there 's more thinking than action . But realism is easier to read . " " Now we 're getting somewhere , " said the teacher . He took over for the rest of the hour . He explained the difference between naturalism and realism . He ended the session by assigning books to be read . Annie was familiar with some of the books . She wished she had pad and pencil to write down the foreign names like Zola and Gorki and something that sounded like Duffyetski . However , she memorized the title of the book written by him . She rushed out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carl came home at his usual time . She did not run to kiss him . She was lying on her stomach on the bed , absorbed in the book . She turned a page before she looked up . " You 're home early . " " Same time as always . " He paused . ' Well ! " " Well , what ? " " Here I come home after a hard day 's work in the coal mines and ... " " Oh , Carl ! " She rushed to him , unbuttoned his coat and put her arms about his waist under the coat . " I did n't know it was so late . " " What 's the name of my rival ? " " How do you mean , Carl ? " " What would you be reading that made you forget me ? "  | " Oh , nothing . Just the best detective story in the world . Crime and Punishment . " The next day , this time armed with pad and pencil , Annie ll took up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She all but wept with disappointment . She had hardly slept the night before , anticipating standing in the hall and listening to the lesson . She told Carl that night . He explained that certain classes did not meet every day , and since the class had been in session on a Thursday , probably it met Thursdays and Tuesdays . Yes , it was in session the following Tuesday . The teacher gave an assignment for the next session : To turn in a twohundred-word evaluation of any book they had read in the course . Annie all but ran home , anxious to fulfill the assignment even though it would never be turned in . She gave Crime and Punishment a good going over . It took a lot more than the allotted two hundred words . Carl was having his postponed interview with the Dean . It was a question-and-answer affair . " You are married . " It was a statement , not a question . " Yes , sir . " And you 've informed your family . " " Yes , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not very well . " " I assume , then , you may expect no further financial aid from that source . " " Under the circumstances , no . " " Your wife : has she found work ? " " No , sir . Not yet . " The Dean matched his fingertips and swiveled his chair around to the side . Perspiration broke out under Carl 's armpits . He felt it was none of the Dean 's damn business how his parents  | felt or if Annie had a job or not . As long as his tuition was paid and his grades were satisfactory , the Dean had no right .. . " Has your wife finished high school ? " The question took Carl by surprise . " She never even started high school , " he blurted out . " Her formal education ended when she was fourteen . " The Dean 's eyebrows shot up . He swiveled back , put both hands on his desk as if to stand up to indicate the interview was over . " But she is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She has a good mind . " ' What does she do ? " " Do ? " Carl did n't quite understand . " I 'll rephrase the question : what is she interested in ? " ' Well , reading mostly . She reads a lot . Then she writes a little ? or tries to . She sort of  --  I do n't know how to put it  --  collects people . And she gets a kick  --  excuse me , sir  --  a sort of feeling about things ; like a clock or the weather . . . " Carl 's voice trailed off . He felt he was n't making a good case for Annie . " And ? " prompted the Dean . ' Well , when a certain class is in session in Casson Hall she stands in the corridor for the hour , listens to the lectures , takes notes , does the assigned reading . I believe it 's the class in comparative modern literature . " The Dean picked up a pencil and drummed the rubber tip on his desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to come to a decision . Evidently he made up his mind . He dropped the pencil and stood up . " Bring your wife here . " " Bring Annie here ? " Carl 's voice went up in surprise . " Bring Annie here , " said the Dean dryly . " But sir . . . " " Tomorrow at four . " The Dean had finished . He started signing letters . Carl said  | the usual thank you . The Dean continued signing without looking up . Carl left . That night , when Carl told Annie that the Dean wanted to see her , she got as excited as if she had been invited to a party . She announced that she 'd wash her hair so the Dean would think she looked nice ; would borrow the landlady 's iron and press her skirt , and , and . . . As arranged , they met next day at ten to four outside the law building . She asked , a little anxiously , if she looked all right . He assured her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Mr. Dean 's ready . " " His name is n't Dean . We refer to him as Dean . His name is Darwent . " " Mr. Darwent , then . " " We do n't call him Darwent . " " What do you call him ? " " Sir . We use ' sir ' like a name . For instance : ' Sir , if I may ask a question ? ' If you do n't understand something , do n't ask . Say sir ' with a question mark . " " Sir this , sir that ! Is he a knight of old or something ? Am I supposed to curt-ess-sy to him ? " " Curtsy , " he corrected . " And do n't be flippant , Annie . " " Who 's flip ? " " Another thing : Do n't shake hands unless he puts his hand out first . " " Learn me some more , " she said ominously . He fell into the trap . " Well , if he says he 's pleased to meet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never say that ! Cry-sake , Carl , are you ashamed of me or something ? " " No , Annie . Never , sweetheart ! It 's just . . . " " Let me be my own dumb self , then , instead of trying to make me over in five minutes . " " I would n't want you made over . I just wanted you to make a I good impression on the Dean . "  | " How about him making a good impression on me ? " " Oh , Annie , co-operate with me a little . It 's so important . " " Carl , " she said gently , " you 're not afraid of the Dean , are you ? " " Hate to admit it , but I am . " " Do n't be . He 's only a man . And , Carl , do n't you worry about me . I 'll be careful what I say . " " That 's my girl . " He noticed she was carrying a book . " Why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have something to hold on to . " The Dean had not expected Annie to be  --  well , Annie . He had expected her to be one of two types : an obviously sexy girl who could tease a boy into marriage or an older , more competent woman . Most medics and laws who married while in school seemed to go for the older , more mature type of woman . But this girl ! She looked like hundreds of other girls . In fact , she reminded the Dean of his own daughter who was in second-year high . Annie fixed her eyes on the Dean 's eyes . She had read somewhere if you looked an enemy straight in the eye he could n't get the edge on you . Annie surmised the Dean must have read the same book because he looked her right straight in the eye , too . Carl introduced her as his wife , Mrs. Brown . Her right hand twitched with the instinct to extend it . But the Dean did not offer his hand . In lieu of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And how do you do , Mrs. Brown ? " he asked . " And how do you do ? " she retaliated . He asked her to sit down . Staring at him she sat down , almost missing the seat . Carl stood behind her , his hand on the top of her chair . " How do you like our college town , Mrs. Brown ? " " Wo n't you call me Annie ? " she said impulsively . The Dean almost smiled , but Carl groaned inwardly . There  | she goes , he thought . He pressed her shoulder . Her eyes went a little wild . She brought her book up to her chest and put both arms around it . " Excuse me , " and then , belatedly , " sir . " She hit the sir a little too hard . There was a silence . The Dean waited , Annie waited . Carl pressed her shoulder gently to remind her she had n't answered the Dean . " Oh ! " she said , " you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked it here ? " The Dean nodded . " I love it here . There 's so much sky here and the air smells nice . " " Your husband told me you were fond of reading . " " I love to read ! " she gulped , and added , " sir . " " What do you read ? " She 's going to say books , thought Carl . To try to make him smile . " I used to read everything I could get my hands on . But now I have a program . . . sir . " " What sort of program ? " " Well , there 's a class and I stand in the hall where they ca n't see me and I write down what books the teacher tells them to read and I get the books out of the library and read them . Oh ! Before I forget : Sometimes the teacher tells them to write a composition for homework . . . " " Composition ? " interrupted the Dean . " Do you mean theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , anyway , I go home and write the theme . " " Do you turn it in ? " " Oh , no , sir . I just stand in the hall . " The Dean matched his fingertips . He said nothing for a while . Annie clutched her book tighter and Carl patted her shoulder . " So , " said the Dean musingly , " you stand in the corridor and audit a class and fulfill the assignments without benefit of criticism or credits . " " Yes , sir . " There was another long silence . " Is that all right , sir ? "  | He swiveled back to face her . " It 's quite all right . " He stood up . " Thank you for coming . " " You mean , " said Annie in incredible relief , " that this meeting is over ? " " Yes , Annie . Your ordeal is over . " He extended his hand . She squeezed it fervently . He shook hands with Carl , too . " Take good care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out in the hall , she asked anxiously , " Did I do all right ? " " You did just fine , sweetheart . I 'm proud of you . " " Were you scared ? " " Just a little in the beginning , " he said . " I was scared all the time . Would n't it be funny if the Dean was scared too ? " " Scared ? My Dean scared ? " he asked incredulously . A-ha ! So it 's my ' Dean now . " " He 's all right , Annie . He 's all right . " " Carl , what did he mean by your asset ' ? " " If I told you , you would n't be fit to live with . " She looked up the word that night while he was going through his prestudy ritual . ASSET : A valuable or desirable thing . Quick tears came to her eyes . " That , " she said aloud , " makes up for the money order to send me home . " Carl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say ? " " Nothing . Excuse me . Sir ! " She was at her usual place in the corridor , facing the wall , pad held up against the wall and pencil poised for note taking . The class was in session , but Annie wondered why it was so quiet . A man strolled out of the classroom , hands in his trousers ' pockets . He was a little on the shabby side , or perhaps indifferent to what he wore and how he wore it . " So , Mrs. Brown , " he said . " You are the ghost who 's been haunting my class . " " He said it was all right , " said Annie defiantly . " Quite all right ,  | was how he said it . The Dean , I mean . " " I am Professor Newcool , known as Prof. " He extended his hand . " My name is Annie Brown . " " I know . " They shook hands . " Will you join us ? " " You mean go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more comfortable than standing in the hall , and we have lots of vacant seats . " She sat in the last seat of the empty last row . She just could n't believe it ! Just like I 'm a coed , she thought . She fell in love with the chair , which had a broad table-like right arm . She vowed that when she got rich she 'd buy a college chair like that and write her first book on it . It was an hour of ecstasy for Annie . She paid intense attention , nodding in approval when the Prof made a point and frowning when a student gave a facetious answer to a serious question , and she took copious notes . The hour ended all too soon , and when the Prof told her he expected her to sit in on all the classes , she was almost too incoherent with happiness to thank him properly . " Look at me , Carl , " she said when Carl came home . " I 'm looking . " " Do I look different ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Look good ! " " Well , your shoes are a little dirtier , your hair a little longer . " " I thought it would show on me . I am a coed ! Well , just the same as one . " She told him about being invited to audit the class . " How 'd you work it ? " " The Prof asked me . And he knew my name ! Carl , how could he know ? Who could have told him ? " " You , of course . " " But he knew before I told him . Do you think it could have been  --  the Dean ? "  | " Of course . Who else ? " Needless to say , Annie lived for those two hours a week . She listened avidly , made notes , read all the assigned books , and mentally answered all the questions put to the students . Sometimes the Prof looked at her , encouraging her to make a comment . She never presumed to do so , feeling she was not entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuition . The class was still tussling with realism and naturalism and seemingly getting nowhere . One afternoon the Prof told them to write a paper of two hundred words or so on realism and naturalism , using Babbitt and Crime and Punishment as examples of the two styles . Then he went out and got a haircut . Annie wrote furiously . A lot of it was incoherent because her thoughts raced ahead of her pencil . She was still writing half an hour later when the Prof returned . He began collecting the papers . She folded hers to put in her coat pocket , but he held out his hand for it and added it to the others . Next session , he read some of the themes aloud . It used to be that the writers read their own work . But he had changed that . Many a bad paper was praised because its author was a dramatic reader . And many a possible literary treasure was lost to the world because its creator read it in a dull monotone . The Prof solved the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each one got an even break in the reading . Annie prayed to our Father which art in heaven , not to let him read her theme aloud . Because they will laugh at me because it is no good . They 'll make fun .. . The Prof cleared his throat . " Class ! I would like your undivided attention while I read the next paper . " He cleared his throat again and read Annie 's paper . Every single person in this world has at least one big fault among many small ones . When a married man has a woman on the side , that is his big fault . Another man 's big fault might be that he wants to get rich and do n't care whose neck he steps on to do so .  | Here is what Mr. Sinclair Lewis did . He did not give Babbitt one big fault , and harp on that . No . He gave him all the little faults there are . He stacked Babbitt . Then he made fun of him . Mr. Lewis never felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Prof paused to smile at Annie 's phonetic spelling . Now take Crime and Punishment . In that book the hero had a great fault ; the greatest fault in the world . He was a murderer . Now the man who wrote this book does not make you feel sorry for the murderer . But he did write it that in some way you understood why he had to murder this woman who he thought was a louse . And because the writer could make you understand this , it made comepassion . Now the difference between Realism and Naturalism . I think it is that Realism makes the people in a book seem real and Naturalism makes them seem more human . When asked , the class as a whole seemed reluctant to comment on Annie 's theme . However , one boy did say he thought referring to murder as a fault was the understatement of the year . A girl wanted to know why the writer of the theme had n't said " mistress , " instead of " a woman on the side . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Prof took over . " Strange , " he said , " that no one commented on the writer 's fresh point of view ; the simplicity of her writing ; the . . . " He 's talking about me , thought Annie ecstatically . He 's talking about me ! " .. . making articulate what is inarticulate . " The bell for changing classes ended the Prof 's comments on her paper . That night she kissed Carl with more than her usual tenderness when he came home , and whispered in a new shy way that she loved him very much . " Now what brought that on ? " He was pleased though . " Nothing . Only I 'm so happy I could die . "  | James W. Darwent , Dean of the Law School , and Professor Victor Newcool of the English Department were long-time friends . Both were busy men but they managed to lunch together at the Faculty Club from time to time . " Yes , thank you , I will . " The student waiter refilled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his cup and said , " No more for me , thanks . " " You were saying . . . " said the Dean . " Yes . I 'd say she had all the ingredients of a potential writer . Too bad she ca n't go ahead . " " This beginning class in playwriting next semester : who 's teaching it , Vic ? " asked the Dean . " Haise , I believe . " " Could you get him to let her audit it ? " " I believe I could . It would be just the thing . She has quite a flair for dialogue , you know . " " Good ! " The waiter poised the coffee pot over the Dean 's cup . " More coffee , sir ? "  | " No , thank you , Harry . I have a staff meeting this afternoon and a third cup of coffee might keep me awake . " By Thanksgiving Annie 's bank account was down to twentyeight dollars . She had had to use her savings to supplement Carl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so easy to budget their money that wedding day on the campus bench . They had faced the big emergencies that could work havoc with their small income  --  sudden illness , dental work , pregnancy . But , fortunately , these big dramatic emergencies did not materialize . It was the small nickel and dime things that came up day by day that plagued them . A pad of paper cost little , but they used a lot of it . Pencils were a bargain at two for a nickel , considering the thousands of words they got out of one pencil . But pencils melted down fast . Razor blades were an item . And honest , Annie , Carl had to have shaving soap . And no , Annie , the bath soap would n't do . And yes , sweetheart , he 'd trim her hair to save the barber 's fee , but no , Annie , she could n't cut his hair . The barber for that . No , he could n't let it go another week . It was down in his collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? And she knew it was cheaper than buying new shoes , but imagine ! Fifty cents ! Just to straighten heels ! And yes , he loved her , but the place where she darned his socks was lumpy and he was getting a callus . He knew she 'd learn , but after all a pair of new socks costs only fifteen cents . She knew it was the last quarter they had , but she just could n't live without a lipstick . And you get that talcum powder , Annie . It makes you smell nice . I did n't like to talk about it , Carl , but sanitary pads . . . " They never have a sale on that , " complained Annie . " And you ca n't charge a box of rubbers . " She frowned . " Do n't talk dirty , Carl . "  | " That 's one of the privileges of married life . Besides , you know all the dirty words . " " That does n't mean I like them . It 's not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ears  --  like chalk scratching on a blackboard . " " Do you know that most of those so-called dirty words come straight from Chaucer ? " No kidding ! " " Read Canterbury Tales sometime . " " I 'll get it from the library tomorrow . " " I just do n't get it , Annie . For a girl as outspoken as you , you use more silly euphemisms . . . " " You-for-what ? What does that mean ? " " You know damn well what that means : Those cute words you use for going to the bathroom and that oh-you-bad-boy routine when I happen to say a plain Anglo-Saxon word . " " Tell me : do you need dirty words to get excited in bed ? " " No , I do n't , " he said , mimicking her , " need dirty words . I 'll tell you what I do need . I need a quarter ? " he looked around pretending he wanted no one else to hear ? " for you-know-what . " She laughed at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickels , dimes and pennies she said , " I wonder why they call it free love . You know : like in Greenwich Village ? " " Annie , ca n't you find another nickel ? I hate to pay with pennies . " Money is money , " she said . " Gee , " he said in exaggerated admiration , " did you think that out all by yourself ? " She spread her arms wide and said dramatically , " Kiss me , my fool ! " He kissed her and went to the door . Hand on knob , he said , " Listen , kid ! The way you wo n't say dirty words , as you call them , and the way you keep telling me you wo n't say them is more exciting than if you did say them . "  | " Why , you . . . ! " She picked up the ashtray . He got the door closed after him before it hit . It did n't break this time  --  it was made of metal . He opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , what 's more , you know it ! " He could run faster than she and was halfway down the street before she was halfway down the stairs . A few nights later when he got home , she announced dramatically , " I got work , at last . " He had an instant of elation followed immediately by depression . The elation was relief that their financial situation would ease a bit and the depression was shame that he felt this relief . He was old-fashioned in some ways . He had been brought up in a generation where a man was practically considered a bum if his wife had to support him in whole or in part . He felt ashamed ? small and insignificant in his own eyes . He did not like to feel this way . He exorcised his shame by being mean to her . " And where does this work take place ? " " I work all day Saturdays in the dime store , and a couple of nights a week I mind a little girl for a lady who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appointment to see you sometime ? " he asked sarcastically . " Oh , Carl ! I thought you 'd be so pleased ! " " How 'd you find these jobs ? Pardon me : work . " " Well , I asked the dime store manager , and he said he could use me Saturdays with the Christmas rush coming on . And then there was a notice on the bulletin board in Casson Hall saying a lady wanted a responsible girl to look after well-behaved child evenings , and . . . " " What is the lady 's name ? " " Mrs. Karter . " Karter ! The name alerted him . " Does she spell it with a K ' or a C ' ? "  | " With a K. ' " Karter , he thought , Karter ! There was something about that name . . . " Carl , will you let me sit on your lap ? Please ? " They sat in the rocker . She put her arms around him and held him tight . " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's only eight dollars left in the bank . " He buried his face in her neck and said : " I know , sweetheart . I know . " She held him . They said nothing for a while . After a while he said , " You wo n't have to drop your class , will you ? " " Oh , no ! That 's why I looked for work instead of a job . " " I 'm glad of that , anyhow . The class means so much to you . " " Oh , Carl ! " She straightened up suddenly . " I forgot to tell you . It 's the most wonderful thing ! You know my prof ? Well , he said next term  --  I mean semester , they repeat the work , and he thinks I should sit in a different class . So he 's going to fix it that I sit , I mean audit , the class in playwriting . What do you think of that ? " " I think it 's wonderful ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Christmas vacation I can work all day every day , the dime store man said . " " And , " he said , " I have a job all lined up . Hardware store . From nine to nine . Twenty dollars for the week before Christmas . " It 's going to be a wonderful Christmas . Our first Christmas together , Carl . " " Annie , " he said suddenly , " is that Karter woman 's first name Beverly ? " " Yes . Why ? " " Oh , I do n't know . Somewhere I must have heard something about her . It 's not very clear in my mind . " " Why , she 's nice , Carl . She has a beautiful home . She has a  | little girl , four years old . Joanny . She 's such a sweet girl . Not pretty , you know , like her mother . But I like the little thing . " " Karter . . . Bev Karter . Um-m . . . " He shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find out . . . " " What are you trying to tell me , Carl ? " " Something I heard , somewhere , some place ... " " You know her ! " she said , instantly suspicious . " You 're afraid I 'll find out something . " " I never laid eyes on the woman . " " That 's your story . " " It 's the truth , Annie . " " I 'm going to work for her . And if I find out anything about you and her . . . " " Annie , you must n't be so jealous . It does n't become you . Suppose I was jealous ? You 're always talking about that grocer of yours . Suppose I was jealous of him . " " Henry ? Jealous of poor old Henry ? Why , you 're crazy . " " Sweetheart , do n't take that job . For my sake . " " I 've already taken it , " she said .  | Bev Karter was youngish rather than young . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were prominent and there were two white knobs at the base of her throat . Her breasts were a little on the small , hard side , but she made the most of them by wearing low-cut or very tight dresses . Her backside was flat , as was her stomach . She dressed well and had what Annie thought of as chick . She went easy on the accessories  --  her only ornament was a gold bracelet with a dozen dangling charms which tinkled incessantly as she moved . There was a faint drift of exotic perfume in the wake of her walk . Her attitude toward Annie was correct . She did not treat the girl as a servant nor as a friend . She liked Annie without being interested in her . Annie liked Bev and was interested in her as well . Annie loved the woman 's apartment . " There 's all these windows , " she told Carl . " No wallpaper because the walls are painted pale yellow and she has these pictures hanging up . I do n't mean pictures like Whistler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Anyhow , she do n't . . . does n't have that . She has pictures you have to ask what they are because you ca n't make them out .  | But that makes no difference because the colors get you kind of excited , and Mrs. Karter said you do n't have to know what they are . All you got to do is feel what they are . " " My ! " said Carl in mock admiration . " She 's a widow , I guess . " " College widow , " he said . " And her husband must have left her a lot of insurance . " " The word is alimony . " " How do you know ? " " She 's an obvious type . There 's one like her in almost every college town . They call them college widows . " " What 's a college widow ? " asked Annie . " The college widow , so called , " said Carl , lawyer fashion , " is a campus institution . Her home , usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lonely but good-looking young men ; the more mature student  --  the medic , the law student , the man working on his Ph.D . She has them over for a social evening . One usually stays behind after the others leave . He spends the night with her ? or part of the night if he has an early class the next day . " " Does she charge ? " " No . The pleasure is all hers . " " How do you know all about this ? " " Oh , Annie ! It 's common knowledge . " Annie thought things over . Mrs. Karter did have one of these social evenings once a week . It was Annie 's job to give little Joanny her supper , put her to bed , then help Mrs. Karter get ready . She helped make finger sandwiches , set up the bridge table , place ashtrays in strategic places , and arrange the records Mrs. Karter had chosen in order on a little table . When the boys arrived , Mrs. Karter said , " That will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She gave Annie her dollar and Annie left . " Carl , if you do n't want me to work for her , I wo n't . " " Annie , I love you with all my heart . But you do exasperate me . You know I do n't want you to work for her and you say you 'll quit , but you keep right on working . "  | " We need the money , Carl , " she said quietly . " Yes . The money . " He sighed and went to the window and looked out , seeing nothing . She went to him . " Carl , the dime store man offered me a full-time job . I could take it and quit Mrs. Karter . But then I 'd have to give up my class . And oh , Carl , I do n't want to do that . " " Do n't give up the class , Annie . No matter what else you do . " " But , Carl , do n't keep at me all the time about working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , sweetheart . I 'm ashamed that because of me you have to work for a ... " She put her hand over his mouth before he could say the word " whore . " " Do n't say that , Carl . You do n't know if she is or not . Anyhow there will be no classes in Christmas vacation , and I 'll take the all-day dime store job and quit Mrs. Karter . " " But what about after Christmas ? " " Something else will turn up . You 'll see . " He sighed and prepared to study . " Carl , before you settle down , could I ask you something ? " " Shoot ! " " Say a woman 's not married : she sleeps with a man who is an old friend . If she does n't charge him , is she still a whore ? Or just a loose woman ? " " Now that 's a moot question . " " What does that mean ? " " Well , in law . . . " " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now . Tomorrow 's another day . " " I 'd sure be surprised if it turned out to be the same day . " He smiled and it was the first time he had smiled that evening . It lightened Annie 's heart . " Do n't be so wise , my darling , " she said . She had taken out Milne 's The House at Pooh Corner because the title was funny . Now she was writing her opinion of  | the book even though no one would read her paper , the book not being required reading in the class . It 's too slick she wrote . It 's the kind of book grownups read and think how they would love it if they were children again . But I do n't think children will like this book . It looks down on them in a way . If a child is too little to know how to read and a grownup reads it to him , he wo n't understand it . If he is old enough to read it himself , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She crossed that out and started the sentence again . Yet , the book has a certain charm .. . Charm , she thought . A dopey word if ever there was one , and this dopey stuff I 'm writing . Eyewash . She tore up the sheet . She did not realize it , but she had been thinking of Mrs. Karter as she wrote . And she did n't like her thoughts . Now : Bev Karter . Annie did n't see anything wrong in her having the boys in for a social evening . It was the man whom Mrs. Karter referred to as an old friend that bothered Annie . He and Mrs. Karter went out every Friday night and did n't come back until midnight . Annie assumed it was a romance and that the friend was young , unmarried , good looking , and had nice ways . Usually Annie was in the bedroom with Joanny when he came , and they had always left before Annie saw him . One night he was a little late and Annie had a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old friend ; in his late fifties . He was shorter than Mrs. Karter , wore thick-lensed glasses , was just about all bald and had a big paunch . It was a week after Annie and Carl had had the discussion about Mrs. Karter . It was raining torrents . The rain was mixed with snow and sleet and there was a cold wind . Annie was in the bedroom reading Joanny to sleep when he came . The bedroom door was slightly ajar . Annie heard him say :  | " No use going out in this weather . No place like home on a night like this . I brought a bottle of Scotch  --  the real stuff . I have a contact  --  gets it for me from Canada . " Mrs. Karter closed the door to the child 's room and Annie heard no more . The child fell asleep . Annie wished she had a book or something to read . She became restless . The room was very small , and Annie never could stand being in a small room with the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady downpour and noticed the thin coating of ice on the sidewalk . The ice glittered under the street lights . And me without overshoes , she thought . How will I ever get home  --  all that ice ? She saw the old friend 's car parked in front of the adjoining apartment house . It was a long gray car ; expensive looking . It had a crystal vase with a red rose in it . Annie wondered whether it was a real rose . She sat on the low chair next to the child 's head and wondered what the child 's father had looked like . He must have looked like Joanny , she thought . She hoped she 'd have a little girl like that someday . But she supposed Carl would want a boy . She hoped that her children would look like Carl because she thought Carl was better looking than she . For some time now she had been aware of the constant murmur of conversation in the living room . Now , sitting in the quiet room , she heard words emerge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and might as well spend the night here . More comfortable than that hotel . " Mrs. Karter said something Annie could n't hear . His voice again : " Just so I get home by one , so she 's not suspicious . " Annie went to the door intending to ask Mrs. Karter if she could go home . Now the voices were distinct . Annie , her hand on the knob , waited for the break in the conversation in order to come out of the bedroom . " Out of the question , Bev . Not that I do n't think a lot of you . " " But who 'll be hurt ? Your children are grown up now and  | have children of their own . And you admitted you did n't love her any more . " I do n't . But I would n't hurt her for anything in the world . " A pause . Annie was about to open the door when Mrs. Karter 's voice came up again . " You know I respect you for that ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get along . That 's true . But she was a good wife to me in the past and a good mother to the children . " " Conscience bother you , sweetie , that you 're cheating on her ? " " Why should it ? It 's not as if I neglect her . I give her everything she wants ; her own car , charge accounts , money . . . " " That reminds me : my rent 's due . " " I took care of that . I put the money on your dressing table . " " I 'll need an extra fifty with Christmas coming up . " " I do n't have that much on me , Bev . " " Write a check . " " Ca n't . She might see your name on the canceled check and there 'd be hell to pay . But let 's see . Yes . I have about thirty in cash . Here . I 'll mail you a twenty-dollar bill in the morning . " So she takes money ! thought Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said : " . . . I 'd never divorce her , Bev . Not even for you , and I think a lot of you . " Annie cleared her throat to warn them and came out of the bedroom . She saw them on the sofa . Mrs. Karter had her legs tucked under her and was counting the money in her lap . Old friend had made himself comfortable . He had loosened his belt to ease his paunch . His detachable stiff collar with a gold collar button still on it and his tie were on the coffee table , along with the bottle of Scotch . Old friend 's feet were up on the table , too . " Why , Annie ! " Mrs. Karter put the bills on the table and stood up . " I forgot all about you ! " " If you do n't need me any more tonight , " began Annie . " Maybe the girl would like a drink , " suggested old friend . " The girl would not like a drink , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go home , " said Annie . " Of course . " Mrs. Karter held out her hand to old friend . " I need a dollar for the girl . " He indicated the bills on the table . " They 're all fives and tens , " said Mrs. Karter . Old friend had to lie on his back , almost , to get a dollar bill out of his pants pocket . Mrs. Karter held out the bill to Annie , and Annie 's hand trembled a bit as she took the money , thinking , he pays her and she pays me . It made her feel as if she were a partner to the affair . She had trouble buttoning her coat . " Here ! Let me , " said Mrs. Karter . She buttoned the coat and arranged Annie 's scarf , making a hood out of the back of it and tucking the ends tightly into the top of the coat . Annie kept her face turned away , aware of the musical tinkle of the bracelet charms and the faint whiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman like her , thought Annie , who always smells so nice and has such a nice little girl , sleep with a pig like him ? " There ! " Mrs. Karter gave the scarf a final pat . " Thank you and good night , Mrs. Karter . " " Wait ! It 's pouring out . I 'll give you an umbrella . " " I do n't need one . But thanks . " " Yes , you do . You can bring it back next time you come . " " I . . . I wo n't be coming here any more . " " Annie ! " She grasped Annie 's arms . " But you ca n't do that to me , " she wailed . " Why , you 're the best girl I ever had and Joanny 's so attached to you . " " I guess I should have told you before , " said Annie lamely . " But why , Annie ? Why ? " She gave the girl a gentle shake . " Is it money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is n't that . " Annie 's eyes went to the man on the sofa . He took his feet off the table and sat up straight . His eyes met Annie 's and she turned away . " It 's just that my husband does n't want me " ? she paused ? " to work nights . " " Maybe if I talked to him . . . "  | Annie shook her head . " Good-by , Mrs. Karter . " Annie had to pass old friend 's car . Yes , that was a real rose in the little crystal vase . Imagine , she marveled . A real rose in the dead of winter ! Her shoes , a soggy mess , squeaked and squelched as she went up the stairs . Her woolen scarf was heavy on her head and neck . It had held every drop of rain that fell on it . And to add to her misery , Carl was n't home . So that 's the way it is , she thought . He did n't expect me home until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back to the room . They spoke simultaneously . " Where were you , Carl ? " and " What are you doing home so early ? " He answered first . " I was down the hall shaving . " She said , " I should have listened to you , Carl . You were right . " " Look at you standing there , " he said , " dripping all over the floor . Cry-sake , Annie , do you want to get pneumonia ? " He removed her scarf and wrung it out in the tin wastebasket . He took off her wet shoes and wrung out her socks , muttering , at least the woman could have lent her an umbrella . " She tried to , Carl , but I would n't take it . You see , I did n't mean to listen , but . . . " " Tell me later . " He rubbed her feet into dry warmth with the bath towel , had her take a hot bath and two aspirins , got her into bed and warmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl ! She takes money ! " " But what happened ? " " Well , I was in Joanny 's room . I could n't help but hear ... " She told him in detail , ending with , " And you were right about her , Carl . " " It should n't have happened , " he said . " I should n't have let you work there . Cry-sake , Annie , did n't you know ? " " Maybe . But I just did n't want to believe it . " " But you 're not stupid and , as you say , you know all the words . " " Well , a person can know a thing is true and still not believe it . He has to see it to believe it . "  | " But I told you , " he said stubbornly . " Was n't that enough ? " " I had to find out for myself . " " You sure could have got yourself in a hell of a lot of trouble . Suppose his wife wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could put in for a fat financial settlement : why , you 'd be a material witness ! The material witness ! " " But I would n't tell the judge what I heard . I 'd say I did n't know nothing  --  I mean anything . " " Then you 'd be up for perjury . " She shrugged . " So what ! " " So you 'd be put in prison . That 's what ! " She scrambled off the bed and clung to him . " Oh , Carl , we 'd be disgraced ! No one would ever hire a lawyer whose wife was once in jail . Oh , Carl ! Why did you let me work for her ? " " Me ? " His voice went high in astonishment . " Me let you work for her ? That 's certainly a new one on me ! " " Oh , Carl , what am I going to do ? What am I going to do ? " " Take it easy , sweetheart . There 's only one chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is having him watched . " " Why 'd you scare me so , then ? " He threw up his hands . " I give up ! " " Carl , when I get old , you wo n't have another woman , will you ? And run me down to her ? " " Another woman ? " he asked incredulously . " God forbid ! I have all I can do to handle the one I already have . " Annie could n't figure out why learning about Mrs. Karter had upset her so . Annie was naive but not stupidly innocent . Since childhood she had known about prostitutes , whores , and girls who " went wrong . " What she did n't know , the other kids had told her . The prostitutes lived in the nicest , cleanest house in the neighborhood . They had their men at night and charged two dollars . The whore lived in a dirty flat and men came at odd times of day and night . She charged fifty cents . Annie knew of  | women like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by them . She was curious about them but not especially interested . The girl that went wrong was different . Annie had known some of them as classmates in grade school . The tough girls started going wrong about fourteen or fifteen . They seldom got into trouble . They knew their way around . It was the potentially good girl , the not too pretty girl , the girl whose parents were too strict or too indifferent toward her , who responded too gratefully to the first man who showed an affectionate interest in her . That was the girl who got into trouble  --  often had an illegitimate child ; ended up in a house of correction . Like poor Ruth , who had lived in the flat above Annie 's : she died , giving birth to an illegitimate child . And only fifteen years old ! All the night , Annie had lain in bed , awake , and the pillow she put over her face and ears could not shut out the horror of the high , inhuman screams from the rooms above . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door ( white for children , lavender for adults and black for the old ) punched home the fact that the wages of sin were , literally , death . Ruth had a reason for what she had done . She wanted to hold the first human being who she thought loved her . The prostitutes had a reason . Money , yes . And the communal life of the brothel suited them . The whore liked being a whore ; it was her nature . And the fictional women  --  Jennie Gerhardt , Sister Carrie , and Maggie , a Girl of the Streets  --  had their reasons . Annie firmly I ' I , believed that everyone had a reason for what he was or was n't . Moral herself , she did not condone the reasons , but she acknowledged them . She could find no reason for Bev Karter 's relationship with 1'h old friend . Bev was not a prostitute , whore , or girl who went wrong . She was well bred . Annie thought of the word " cultured " in connection with Bev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comfortable background . Why , thought Annie , why ?  | Obviously she slept with old friend and took money from him . But money could n't be the reason . There had to be a better reason . Annie became so tormented and obsessed by this elusive reason that she invented a reason for Mrs. Karter , and old friend too , by writing it out . She is that way wrote Annie because maybe she never had a brother who teased her and shoved her around but grew to think his sister was pretty wonderful . Or maybe her father never told her in so many words that she was the best girl in the world . And maybe the husband she must have had was n't like Carl . Maybe he never made her sit on his lap so he could rock her and pet her . She never had things like that . So now , she keeps looking for those lost things in her life , always hoping to find them . Tenderness , I guess , is what she never had . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is truly an old friend . Maybe she knew him long ago when he was young and slim and good looking . When he was full of beans . She crossed out beans and wrote dreams . But he married someone else . Thus Annie got a reason for the way Mrs. Karter was . Maybe it was n't the real reason , but it served as far as Annie was concerned .  | She liked working at the dime store at first . It was like being a kid again and playing store for real . She was interested in her customers , patient with them , took pains to wrap their packages nicely , and never failed to say thank you and come again to each customer . Things changed when the Christmas rush started . The customers seemed to get meaner and meaner as the season of good will got under way . They claimed they had been shortchanged ; had been sold broken toys , claiming the girl knew they were broken when the girl sold them . The manager had to be sent for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew she was not to blame , but he had to pretend to give her hell because it made the customer feel righteous . Annie played along . At first she apologized so abjectly to the customer that the manager had to warn her not to overdo it . The cash register drove her crazy . It was high up , and she was only five feet two . She had to stand on tiptoes to work it and the muscles in the back of her legs ached all the time . One day as she was ringing up she turned to reply to a customer 's question , and the drawer shot out and clipped her on the chin .  | Henry , the grocer , noticed the black-and-blue bruise and asked what had happened . According to their game , it was her cue to say she 'd tell him tomorrow . But fearing the grocer might think Carl had beat her up , she told Henry about the cash register . 1 le got a small wooden box from the back room , had her stand on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . She carried it to the dime store and stood on it to work the cash register . During the last week before Christmas , the dime store remained open until ten o'clock . In lieu of overtime pay , the girls were given free supper at the lunch counter . Like the bus boys in Carl 's cafeteria , Annie saw to it that her plate was well loaded . Carl , released from the cafeteria for a week , because there was n't much business there with the students away for Christmas , worked also . He worked full time and overtime in the hardware store where Annie had bought her clock . Carl and Annie agreed they would not buy Christmas presents for anybody . They needed the money for themselves . But Annie felt she had to send her little brothers a present . Carl said yes . He had been a little boy once himself and he knew how kids looked forward to presents . And they could not overlook the landlady , who was nice enough to let Annie use her iron for Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering about the tea and the hot-water bottle and the aspirin . And , oh , he felt that he had to give Mrs. Ridinski something . She had sort of looked after him before he was married , you know , sewed a loose button on his coat . Things like that . Annie said , of course . He would be a pig if he forgot Mrs. Ridinski . There was something he hated to bring up . But his mother . . . Annie thought that over and came to the conclusion that after all she was his mother , no matter what , and was entitled to a present . Carl urged Annie to buy her mother a gift . Annie said she had thought of it but had n't liked to bring it up , and she certainly appreciated his not objecting to it . " But , Carl , I do n't want you to get anything for me . I have you  | and that 's enough . Besides , we need the money so bad . " " I wo n't get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Oka y ? Annie had thought of getting a Christmas tree . A little one did n't cost much , but the ornaments ran into money and who could afford to buy them all at once ? Ornaments had to be acquired year by year , and often a child grew to maturity before there was a completely filled Christmas tree in his home . She decided to get some sprigs of holly instead . The florist 's window was full of potted poinsettias , red geraniums , and pink begonias . But Annie fell in love with a little hairy-leaved plant in a pink flowerpot . The florist , who was writing in a ledger , looked up at the window . He went back to his book , not having recognized her because he 'd never seen her in her new outfit . When she went into the store , he closed his book before he looked up and asked , " What can I do for you ? " " That hairy plant in the window : what is it called ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know until I heard your voice . I thought you were a coed staying over to share our local Christmas . How have you been , Mrs. . . . er . . . " Pleased at being mistaken for a coed , she said impulsively , " Call me Annie . " " Anthony , here . " They shook hands across the counter . " I remember you pleasantly , Annie . " " Me , too , Anthony . I mean the way you spoke about the roots and all . " " What roots ? " " You know : The Rape of the Forest ? I 'm glad to see you 're writing it . " She pointed to the ledger . " Oh , that ! I was merely going over my accounts . " " So you are not writing a book . " Her disappointment was obvious .  | " I 'm not ready for it . I have to think it through first . The writing is nothing . The thinking is all . " " But could n't you think and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers also ? Frankly , no . " " Frankly , good-by , then . " She turned to leave . " Wait ! The name of the plant in the window is saintpaulia , known to the layman as an African violet . " " I do n't care what its name is . You 're not writing a book . " You are concerned ? " " Worse than that . Disappointed . " " May I ask why ? " " All my life I wanted to know somebody who was writing a book . " " I see . You do n't care to know a florist ? " " I already know a florist . In Brooklyn . He could n't write a book if he tried . But you . . . " " I 'll write the book ! " he announced . " Oh , will you ? Promise ? " " I promise to go into writing January first , 1928 . " " Oh , I 'm so happy , Anthony . " " I value your faith in me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further before she bought three sprigs of holly for a dime . He wanted her to take the holly as a gift but she refused . He added another sprig as a present . All of a sudden it was Christmas Eve . The dime store closed at six . Annie got her pay and a new dollar bill in a Christmas folder as a gift . She also received an offer to continue working on Saturdays , from nine in the morning to nine at night , for two dollars and free supper . She accepted . On the way home she bought a box of chocolate cherries for the landlady and stopped in to wish Henry , the grocer , a merry Christmas . He presented her with a strawberry basket , left over from the summer , filled with walnuts .  | " Oh , Henry ! How nice you are ! " Then , stricken , " And I did n't give you anything ! " " Ah , they 're only nuts , " he said . " Lean over the counter . " He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek . " Say , Annie ! That 's the nicest Christmas present I ever had ! " When she got to the room , she heard Carl calling from nowhere , " Where were you ? " " Tell me first where you are ? " " In the closet . " " What are you doing in there ? " " Brooding . " " Come out and see what Henry gave me for Christmas . " " That 's fine . But see what the landlady gave us . " It was a small white cake baked in the shape of a star with a little paper angel on top . Annie read the card that went with it : " Merry Christmas from Margo Hansmon . " " It 's the most beautiful cake I ever saw . And , Carl , she has a first name ! " " Everyone has a first name . What 's so odd about that ? " " Well , you just do n't think of landladies having a first name , that 's all . " They went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small Christmas tree . She asked Carl to carry it out to the hall and put it on the hall table so that they all could enjoy it . Annie thought that was such a nice thing to do and told her so . The landlady thought it was very thoughtful of Annie and Mr. Brown to give her a present and she told them so . While Annie was hanging the holly upside down on the shade pull , Carl got two boxes and a few Christmas post cards out of the closet . He had asked the landlady to put them aside so Annie would be surprised . He set the boxes and the cards on the dresser . Annie wanted to open the boxes at once , but Carl insisted they go out and have something to eat first  --  at least a sandwich and coffee . It was only seven o'clock , and if they  | opened them now , Christmas would be over in ten minutes . 1 le let her open the cards , however . One was from his family and one from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arlene , and one from an aunt she had n't seen in years . The last card came in a thick cream-colored envelope . It was a simple card saying : " Season 's greetings from James and Janet Darwent . " " Darwent ? " Annie said , puzzled . " The Dean ! Well , what do you know ! " Carl seemed very pleased . She ran her finger over the card . " Carl ! It 's engraved . " Of course . " " They must be aristocrats from way back . My ! " Back from their hurried supper , Annie threw her coat on the bed , dropped her handbag in the drawer without bothering to shut the drawer and said , " Hurry up ! You open yours first . " He decided to tease her a bit . " Hang up your coat first . " She did . " Close the dresser drawer . " She banged it shut . " Now go wash your hands . " ? Why ? ? " Because I said so . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother 's present and make it dirty ? " " Annie , do n't let 's fight . Not on Christmas Eve . " She put her arms around him and pressed ' her face against his chest . " I 'm sorry , Carl . And do n't mind what I say , darling . " Then she spoke one of woman 's oldest excuses . You see , it 's getting to be that time in the month when I get on edge for nothing at all. ? " I was only teasing you , sweetheart . " " I know . Now open your present . " Mrs. Brown had sent her son two sets of underwear ; the kind with long arms and legs and a seat that opened up in the back .  | " I do n't know what got into Mom , " he said . " She knows I hate long underdrawers  --  never wear ' em . Never did . " " Well , like people say , Carl , it 's the thought , not the gift . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card attached to the underwear said : " To my son with all my love . " There was a small flat box with " Annie " written on the cover . It contained a handkerchief . " At least Mom remembered you , " he said . " On the package I sent , I addressed it to the whole family and wrote that it was from you and me . " He sighed . " I ca n't help it , Annie . Mom is the way she is , and there 's nothing I can do about it . " Aside from a sharp look , Annie made no comment . She opened the package from her mother . The card read : " For Annie and Carl from all of us . " She showed Carl the card . He made no comment , but a muscle twitched in his cheek . The joint gift was a woolen blanket made of alternating large black and red squares . But we have a blanket , " he said . " It belongs to the landlady . This one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a house of our own . At least she sent a gift we could share . But not your mother ! We ca n't share the underwear or the handkerchief . It 's her way of separating us . " " Very good , Mrs. Freud , " he said . " Very good . " There was a dangerous silence . Each waited for the other to say the next mean thing to get a quarrel under way . She spoke first . " Not on Christmas Eve , Carl . " " Not on Christmas Eve , " he agreed with relief . He pressed his check against hers . " I know , sweetheart . I know how you feel . " She put the boxed handkerchief in the bottom drawer , knowing she 'd never use it . He put the folded underwear on the top shelf of the closet , knowing he 'd never use it . He asked whether she wanted the blanket put away . She said no , and folded it and put it at the foot of the bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ? " " Annie , if you want my honest opinion . . . " he began .  | " Not on Christmas Eve , " she said hurriedly . They smiled at each other . He sat in the rocker . " Well , Merry Christmas , sweetheart . " Annie was wedging the Christmas cards in the frame of the mirror . " Come sit on my lap , " he said . " When I finish this , Carl . " He got up to get a cigarette . She took advantage of his turned back to get a small package from her handbag . " Open your hand and shut your eyes and I 'll give you something to make you wise , " she said . He did n't seem to understand . " Never mind . Here ! " She held out the small box wrapped in holly paper and tied with a red ribbon . " But , Annie , we agreed  --  promised each other ... " " Open it ! " It was Carl 's watch , which she had redeemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what to say , " he faltered . " Say thanks . " " Many , many thanks , sweetheart . Oh , Annie , you do n't know how I missed it ! Not because Mom gave it to me , but I was lost without it . I have to time everything so carefully , racing around with the papers , getting to the cafeteria , split seconds to make a class , always worrying whether I 'd be late . Well , thanks . " He set the time and wound the watch . She sat on his lap and put it on his wrist . " Annie , " he said tentatively , " I do n't want to start a fight on Christmas Eve , but I always felt that you hated the watch because Mom gave it to me . " " If I did , I do n't now . We made the last two payments , and on the note you put down that you owed her for the other payments . So now I feel that maybe she picked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel just terrible . " " Do n't . Enjoy the watch . " " I mean , I did n't get you a present . " " What ? " She was off his lap in a flash . " You mean you did n't get me anything ? " Her voice went up in indignation . " But you made me promise not to buy you a present . "  | " And you believed me ? " " But you said ! " " But I did n't mean it ! Did n't you know ? It 's like when you say I 'm pleased to meet you ' when you 're not pleased , really . You should have known that . " " I ca n't say how sorry I am . " " Do n't talk to me , " she said coldly . She went to the holly and pulled off a leaf that was n't withered . " All right , if that 's the way you feel , " he said in a huff . He went into the closet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't mean it . Do n't go out . I 'm not mad . I was just disappointed for a minute . Carl ? " He came out of the closet with the gift he had hidden there . " Why do you take everything so seriously , Annie ? Of course I got you a present . " It was a large loose-leaf notebook . The covers were limp , darkred leather and her name , Annie Brown , was in gold letters on the upper right-hand corner . It took her breath away . Literally ! She drew in a breath in a gasp of delight and it would n't come back out until he pounded her on the back . " It 's beautiful ! " she said . " Like in church . More than beautiful . There must be a word higher than beautiful , and I wish I knew it . " " Look inside . " The first page was blank except for two typed lines in the middle . The first line was Potpourri . Under it , By Annie Brown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's pronounced po-poo-re . It means a little of everything nice , I think , " he ended dubiously . He had taken her manuscripts and had them typed up by the hotel stenographer . He had used her title when she had one and made up titles when she did n't . The first manuscript was titled The Stupid Heart , the untitled Babbitt one he titled Real Versus Natural . Her evaluation of the Milne book he called For Grown- ups Only , and the last , the Mrs. Karter one , had her own title : A Sad Story . " But , Carl , I tore up the House at Pooh Corner one . " " You tore it very carefully in half and did n't throw it away . " " It 's like I had a book printed , " she said . " And it makes me happy because you must sort of believe in me . " " You bet I do . " " Would you say it in so many words ? " " You 'll be a writer someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't really believe it , do you ? " " You believe it . That 's more important . " " I know . But a person likes a little encouragement . I know my grammar is bad and my spelling , too . And I ca n't write a sentence of more than six words without getting lost . So I got to have encouragement . " " Annie , anything you set your mind on doing you will do . With or without encouragement . I know you pretty well by now . " I 'll never be a writer , really . But I love to write all the same . I did get encouragement from this Hemingway . I read In Our Time while I ate lunch and supper at the dime store . You know he writes in short sentences ? He must have the same trouble I have with sentences . And he writes in conversations because , like me , that 's easier . I figure if he can get away with it , so can I. " " That reminds me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a package of lined paper to fit the loose-leaf folder . " I forgot this goes with it , " he said . " You can write on these sheets and clip them into the book along with your other stories . " " Carl , you think of everything . And I 've got a new story all figured out ; about our first Christmas together . Let 's see , what 'll I call it ? Carl , you 're so good on names . You tell me what to call it . " " How about Our First Christmas Together ? " " That 's good , Carl . Very good ! Let me write it down before I  | forget it ! Let me write the first line while it 's fresh in my head . Wo n't take a minute . " She wrote : It started out in great excitement  --  our first Christmas together . Then it looked as though it would end in grief . Then something wonderful took place  --  a truly Christmas miracle like in an O. Henry story . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to write but one line . Carl paced the floor , smoking one cigarette after another . He felt shut out . When he could stand it no longer , he went and took the pencil out of her hand . " Annie , there is so little time when we can be together and it 's Christmas Eve ... " She was instantly contrite . " I 'm such a dope , " she said , putting the book and paper into the drawer . " I do n't know why you put up with me . " She put her arms around him . " But I 'm glad you do . " " It 's only a little after eight , and I thought we could celebrate a little . How about the movies ? They 've got Laurel and Hardy . " " I do n't think it 's nice to see Laurel and Hardy on the night Jesus was born . " " That 's right , " he agreed . " Besides , even if it was n't Christmas , I do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . It makes me sick . " " Well , how about an old-fashioned walk ? " " That would be grand . We can look at all the Christmas trees in people 's windows . " It was a lovely night . " Snow on the ground , " said Carl . " The stars shining . That 's how Christmas should be . Cold and clear . " " I 'd like it better if it was a little warm , " she said . " And misty . So the stars would be mysterious through the mist . All dreamy . And no snow . It was a warm country where He was born . And  | in all the pictures of the manger and the shepherds and the Wise Men , I never saw a bit of snow . Did you ? " " Come to think of it , no . " They walked hand in hand , stopping at times to admire a Christmas tree in someone 's window . In one they saw children around the tree . A little one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years from now , " said Annie . " And where 's my son ? " asked Carl . " Upstairs , somewhere . " In one place the people had decorated a big live tree just outside the door . " That 's what I 'll do when we have a home , " she said . " Decorate a tree in the front yard with lights and golden balls and tinsel and angels for the whole world to see . " " I believe you 'd do just that . You were born an exhibitionist . " " I was not ! I was born a Methodist ! " " If that 's a joke , pardon me for not laughing . " " Oh , you ! " She gave him one of her affectionate shoves . They came to a church . The door was open . The altar glowed with red poinsettias and white tapers that seemed to breathe out pointed lights . There was a smell of incense . " Let 's go in for a minute , Carl . " " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the church do n't know that . Come on ! " They sat quiet in the back pew for a little while . They ended the evening with refreshments at the drugstore . She had a banana split , and when the soda boy asked , " The works ? " she said , yes , emphatically . Carl had a dish of coffee ice cream . " I 'll be sorry when I get old , " she said . " Who wo n't be ? " he answered . " I mean , old people do n't enjoy things like banana splits . " " I must be old before my time , " he said . " I could n't eat a mixed-up concoction like that . " " You just do n't know what you 're missing , " she said .  | Preparing for bed , he emptied his money on the dresser . She got out her earnings and put them with Carl 's . Between them , they had almost thirty dollars . " With this and your five dollars a week paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll have enough money to get us through next month and February and March , too , because February 's a short month . " " Do n't count on it , sweetheart . " ' Why , all we need is money for rent and my food . " " You 'll need new shoes soon . And I 'll need textbooks for the coming semester . " The line on his forehead seemed to deepen . " Do n't worry , darling . " She tried to smooth out the line . " You do n't count on emergencies . " " There wo n't be any . If there are , I 've still got eight dollars in the bank and you can always loan your watch to the pawnshop for seven or eight dollars . " " But this being poor , the way we are . . . " " But it 's not the tenement kind of poor . That 's being poor for nothing . But we 're poor for something . You 'll get a law degree out of it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by being allowed to go to my class . " " But . . . " " No buts about it . Being poor does n't bother me too much . I 'm used to it , I guess . Besides , I have a feeling that something wonderful will turn up before our money 's gone . It 's a very strong feeling . So stop worrying now . " As a matter of fact , something quite wonderful did turn up .  | Like most large institutions , the university had its satellite town . It was too small , actually , to be called a town and too large to be called a village . The university people referred to it as a country town . Lopin was separated from the university by a twohundred-seat athletic field , which was a baseball field in the spring and a football field in the fall . It was called The Lopin I Iigh School Athletic Field . There was a three-room caretaker 's cottage and a four-shower clubhouse at the university end of the field . Lopin was at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many had a drop or more of Indian blood . There were few college degrees among them , and they had a contempt for the neighboring university people , who , in turn , ignored the Lopinites , except to patronize them . Yet , they could not exist without each other . The university needed Lopin and Lopin needed the university . The economy of Lopin depended on the university and the smooth running of the university depended on the people of Lopin . The Lopin men were the university 's electricians , plumbers , repair men , grounds keepers , painters , window washers , garbage men , watchmen and  | janitors . The Lopin women were its seamstresses , laundrywomen , housecleaners , baby minders , and practical nurses . The sons and daughters were clerks , secretaries , typists , and telephone operators in the many offices of the university . Lopin had been settled long before the university was dreamed of . A little Frenchman had started the settlement . He was one of a party of explorers paddling around the Great Lakes looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , threw in his paddle , swam to the nearest shore , and started walking until he came to a place he liked . A small tribe of apathetic nomad Indians had settled there for the time being . The little white man was enchanted with the land and with a plump Indian girl with swimming dark eyes . He made passionate speeches to the Indians in his native tongue . The Indians had n't understood a word he said . But one word , Lopin , was spoken over and over in his speeches . He said , " Un lopin de terre ! Un lopin de terre ! " He was asking for a piece of land , but they thought he was saying , " My name is Lopin . " So they called him Lopin . In the fall the squaws struck the tepees and the little tribe strolled away . They were going south , where the living was easier . The plump Indian girl remained behind , and she and the Frenchman married . He performed the ceremony himself . His Indian bride helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cabin . His wife called him Lopin , believing that was his name , and in time he got to believing it too . Seven Lopin sons were born . He baptized them himself and named them Jack , Alan , Paul , Bill , Albert , and Frank . He was out of names when the seventh and last son came along . He called him Lopin . His name was Lopin Lopin . While the boys were growing up , flaxen-haired , blue-eyed Swedes settled there . At maturity the Lopin boys married the Swedish girls . While Lopin 's forty-odd grandchildren were growing up , the railroads were coming through and Irish laborers set- tied there and their children married the Swedish-French-Indian grandchildren and so on down through the generations and the Indian blood thinned out in time . But there was still a drop or more in nearly everyone who lived in Lopin . A letter came for Carl . It had a Lopin postmark . It was from one Albert Lopin , principal of the Lopin High School . Mr. Lopin wished to see Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something would turn up , " gloated Annie . " I bet he 's going to give you a job teaching the boys how to play football . " " Coach football , " he said absently . " I wonder how he got my name ? " " The Dean gave it to him . Who else ? " " Well , I 'll go see what he wants . " Albert Lopin was a bright , eager , gregarious little fellow , part French , Swedish and Indian . He told Carl all about his ancestor 's settling the place and how , with the aid of his Indian wife , of course , he had founded the Lopin dynasty . Carl fidgeted and worried about missing his next class . Eventually the little fellow came to the point . The athletic coach , who also taught English and algebra and had occupied the caretaker 's cottage , had resigned to accept a coaching job in Pittsburgh , where he had to teach but one subject . A new teacher-coach would take over in March . In the interval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fires up in the clubhouse so the pipes would n't freeze and to prevent university students and their girls from gaining entrance to the cottage with a skeleton key and using the place for what Mr. Lopin called illicit love . Well , this started Mr. Lopin on the topic of what were our young people coming to . Now , in his day . . . It was a long monologue on comparative morals . Carl looked at his watch . Knowing he would miss his next class , he thought he might as well relax . He interrupted Mr. Lopin to ask permission to smoke .  | Mr. Lopin gave it and accepted a cigarette himself . At last he got to the point . " Well , sir , I went to Jim Darwent  --  the Dean 's an old friend of mine  --  and asked him to recommend a steady young man , preferably married and . . . Oh , by the way , I took law for a year . " He was off on that : how he had searched his soul and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law was n't meant for him . And .. . " Excuse mc , sir . About the cottage ? " " Oh , yes ! " Carl could live in the cottage rent free in return for keeping up the fire in the clubhouse . Electricity and gas for cooking would be supplied free . There was a telephone for his use  --  no long-distance calls , of course . And he 'd have to supply his own fuel for the cottage . Carl accepted , contingent , of course , upon Annie 's approval . Mr. Lopin gave him the key , requested that Carl and Annie look it over immediately , and while Carl was there , would he put some coal on the fire ? It would save him , Mr. Lopin , from making the trip . " And keep in mind , " he said , over the good-by handshake , " it 's only until March . " " It 's beautiful ! " said Annie breathlessly . " Just beautiful ! " Carl had his doubts . The living room had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telephone on the wall . The tiny bedroom had a double bed , and there was hardly room for the pine chest of drawers with a dime store mirror above it . The kitchen also had two chairs and a table , a wood-and-coal stove , a two-burner gas plate , and the minimum of dishes , pots and pans . The lighting in all the rooms was simple : a cord from the center of the ceiling with a naked bulb at the end . " Where 's the bathroom ? " she asked . They looked all over but could n't find it . There was a door in the kitchen . Annie had thought it was a closet . In a way it was . It contained a toilet , a washbowl , and nothing more . " How do we take a bath , Carl ? "  | " We 'll have to go to the clubhouse and use the showers . " . " Imagine , " she said , " getting dressed to go out to take a bath . " ' that 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll have to buy sheets and pillow slips and towels , and , say ! Mama 's blanket will sure come in handy . " " And Mom 's underwear . Do n't laugh , Annie . We 'll each wear a suit as pajamas . That 's a mighty cold bedroom . " She paid no attention to that . " You can give up your job at the cafeteria and I 'll learn to cook . " " You mean to say that you had nerve enough to marry without knowing how to cook ? " " What 's cooking ? You boil stuff or fry it or stick it in the oven or else eat it raw . Like lettuce . " " But do n't you know that many a homely woman got a man because she knew how to cook well ? And do n't you know the surest way to a man 's heart is through his stomach ? " , But who wants to make a dirty trip like that ? " She was all for moving in the next day but Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had to give Mrs. Hansmon some notice . " All right . That will give me two days to clean up this place . Carl , I have a wonderful idea ! I 'll buy some paint and a brush and paint the chairs and tables . What color do you think , Carl ? " " Sweetheart ! " He put his hands on her shoulders . " Look at me and listen carefully . We will have to give up this house when the new coach comes . We will be here only two months . Do you understand ? " " Sure . But even so , I 'd like to make it look nice while we are here . " " Do n't , Annie ! Please ! If you make it too nice , it will break your heart to leave it . " " Maybe we wo n't have to . Maybe the coach wo n't want to live here . Maybe he 'll have six children and it wo n't be big enough . "  | " Annie , Annie . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the line between his eyes seemed to deepen . " All right , darling . I wo n't paint the chairs then . " She left at six o'clock the next morning , carrying her alarm clock and as many of their possessions as she could . The cottage did n't look so wonderful in cold daylight . It was dusty and shabby , and the windows were so dirty you could n't see out . And the house was ice-cold . She made a fire in the kitchen stove , using paper , wood and coal from the clubhouse , coal which she expected to return when they got their own supply . She got a good fire going and shut off the other rooms . In a short time the kitchen was nice and warm , but still very dirty . She got broom , mop , and little slivers of soap that smelled like carbolic , from the clubhouse , and gave the kitchen a thorough cleaning . The cleaned kitchen windows , sans shades or curtains , seemed to bring the whole snow-covered athletic field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory at the end of the field . Later she 'd learn that it was a lamp shade factory . The tops of many small houses could be seen at the north end . She surmised that was the town of Lapin . She decided to walk over and see what the town looked like . It was a five-minute walk . A street sign read Main Street . So there is really such a street , she thought with a thrill . And all the while I thought Mr. Lewis made that name up . She came upon a little grocery store and paused outside . She thought dramatically , This little store is about to become a part of my life . I will buy our food here . The people who run it will either get to be my friends or they 'll just put up with me . But at least they 'll do something . It was a combined grocery and butcher store . A man with a wide mouth and narrow eyes and coarse black hair was behind the counter working on a portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Indian , surmised Annie . At least she thought he was descended from one . She anticipated the new heading on her list ,  | Indians I Know , and his name under it when she found out what it was . There was also a woman with pretty blond hair and a heavy sullen face . She was swollen with a child soon to come and held another , who looked big enough to walk , astride her hip . This one had two handfuls of his mother 's hair which he used as reins , nd from time to time he dug his heels into her and hollered " Gidd-yop " as though his mother was a horse . " Yes ? " said the woman . The word was like a challenge . Annie asked for a pack of cigarettes . The woman put a pack on the counter . " Ten cents . Two for nineteen . " Annie took two , delighted at saving a penny . " You have a nice place here , " said Annie . The man and woman looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You bastard ! " said the woman suddenly . Annie almost jumped out of her skin and her face got hot . But the epithet was meant for the baby , who had bitten his mother 's ear . Annie had another heading for her list : Strange Mothers . Under it , she 'd write : Mother Who Calls Baby Bastard . " And just think , " she told Carl that night , " we 'll save half a cent on each pack . Only those people are going to be hard to know . But I 'll work on it . " " You just hold still , Annie , and let them make the overtures . I f they want to be friends they 'll do it their own way . They think you 're from the university , and they do n't care much for university people . So just go easy about making friends in Lopin . " The next morning , burdened down with things to take to the cottage , she stopped at Henry 's store and bought a half pound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread . " What 's the best way to make coffee , Henry ? And tell me now , not tomorrow . " " You do n't know how to make coffee ? " " Now listen , Henry : I did n't say how , I said best . "  | " For two cups you put in three cups of water . When it boils up , you put in three tablespoons of coffee . Let it be until there is chocolate foam on top , then take it off the stove and throw in a little cold water . " " But I like coffee hot . " " The cold water settles it . The prunes , now , follow the direc tions on the box , and the bread you cut with a knife . " " Now stop it , Henry . I 'm not that dumb . " " I 'll miss you , Annie . " " Oh , I 'll have to come on campus twice a week , and I 'll drop in to see you . It 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It wo n't be the same like running in for jelly when I 'm closing up . " " No , it wo n't , " she said . " But that 's life . " He agreed , and on that philosophical note they shook hand fervently as though they were parting forever . " One more thing , Henry : why do you have to use three of everything to make only two cups ? " " I 'll tell you next time I see you , " he said . Among the items she had brought to the cottage was a box of her summer dresses , which her mother had mailed to her . Two of the dresses , a red-checked gingham and a blue , were too worn to wear . Annie made kitchen curtains out of the skirts , the blue check for one window and the red for another . She was an in different seamstress . The skirt hems served as curtain hems . For the top , she folded down an inch of material and basted it . It tool . her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were curtain rods attached to the windows . She hung the curtains , and they looked fine except they needed pressing . That reminded her she had to get an iron for Carl 's shirts . She had a dozen dried prunes for lunch and a slice of bread warmed in the oven and two cups of coffee . She sat at the table for a long time trying to figure out where the third cup of water and spoon of coffee went to . How did three cups of water turf ,  | into two ? She got it straight after a while . The wet grounds had absorbed a lot , and some of the water had gone off into steam . So many things to find out , she thought ; so much to learn , I 'll be ( lead and buried before I learn half of it . She went into Lopin to get some eggs for her supper . The baby was riding his mother 's other hip this time , and the man was grinding meat for hamburger . Annie asked for four eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag on the counter . Annie put a dime on the counter . Putting the eggs in the bag , Annie asked : " Is there a dry goods store in town ? " The man stopped grinding , and he and the woman exchanged looks before the woman said , " Two blocks . " The man extended his arm and said , " That way . " Annie thanked them . On the way out she tweaked the baby 's bare foot . Swift as lightning , the woman transferred the child to her other hip , away from Annie . " Excuse me , " said Annie , " but he 's so cute . " At least they talked to me in a way , she thought as she left . Aggie Lopin , spinster , owner of the dry goods store , was to become another item on Annie 's list . Miss Aggie had an old woman 's face and a perennially young-looking body . It was as if standing where the brook and river met , she went no further . The little hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hips had never swelled to indent her waistline , and her legs were the thin straight legs of a child . There was an aura of expectancy about her , as if she 'd burst into bloom any moment . Unlike the grocery people , Miss Aggie was very loquacious . The principal of the high school was her nephew , and he had a degree from the university . This made Miss Aggie Town and Gown , as it were . Annie asked her about the grocery store people . " Those Lopins ! You see , my dear , he 's part Indian and she 's a white woman , and she 's too proud to marry him . So they just live together and have children . What a woman wo n't do to save her pride ! " Annie told Miss Aggie they were going to move into the little  | cottage the next day . " Thank God ! " Miss Aggie said fervently " The things that go on in there when it 's vacated ! You see , my dear , I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look in the bedroom window just to check if everything 's all right . And the things I 've seen ! " She raised her hands and rolled her eyes . " The sinful goings on , my dear . I would n't dare tell you . " But she told her anyhow and advised Annie to get a new mattress . She had a nice one in the back room that she 'd sell cheap . But Annie did n't want a new mattress . She wanted two sheets , two pillow slips , two bath towels , and two dish towels . She almost had to beg Miss Aggie to sell her these items . The woman would rather talk than sell . Annie asked her where she could get a secondhand iron . Miss Aggie told her to try the secondhand store around the corner . Annie got away but not before Miss Aggie had told her all about the secondhand store man . It was n't a store , really . It was a junk shop . Annie found a rusty iron in the corner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for it . He took the iron and started rubbing the rust off with a piece of sandpaper . " That 's nice of you to do that for me , " she said . Immediate he handed her the iron and the sandpaper . Me and my bi mouth , she thought . Now I 'll have to do it myself . She saw a rocker . It was in good condition except that three legs matched and the fourth was a stick of new wood . It was a dollar and a half . She paid a quarter deposit , explaining that her husband would pay the balance when he came to pick it up . She wrote out a receipt for the quarter and asked him to sign it . 1 le made a cross on the paper . Following directions on the box , she put the prunes in a pot put a cup of water over them and placed the covered pot on th back of the stove to cook slowly all afternoon . She went to make up the bed with the new sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bedroom . Yes , the sill was low enough that even a small woman like Miss Aggie could look in . I 've got to do something about that , she decided , so that when the moon is bright Miss Aggie ca n't look in and watch us in the act of sin . She hung the two bath towels on the curtain rods . She looked at the mattress which , according to Miss Aggie , had been so much sinned upon . The mattress looked innocent enough to Annie , but she decided to turn it over to get rid of the idea of other couples having used it . It was a terrific job . She pulled and pushed and used her head as a ramrod and broke two fingernails before she got it turned . She threw herself on the bed in exhaustion . She was flushed and her heart was beating rapidly . She soon relaxed , though , and was about drifting off to sleep when the phone rang , flooding the cottage with its raucous demand for attention . She got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . " Me . I 'm calling between classes . How are you doing ? " " Carl ! They 're not married ! " " Who 's not married ? " " The grocery people . " " Annie , that 's none of our business . " " But they already have a baby and another one on the way and the children will grow up to be bastards . " " Stop worrying . They 're married . " " But Miss Aggie said . . " Who ? Oh , never mind who said it . They are married . " " No , they 're not because she 's proud . " " Listen , Annie , if they live together for a certain number of years and have children , they are married by common law . " " Honest , Carl ? " " Honest . So stop worrying . " " But ? " " Listen , Annie , I called to tell you I 'll be home a little late tonight . "  | " Our last night in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to go out there to bank the clubhouse fire . " " I 'll do it , Carl . I 'll be here until dark anyhow . " She wanted to talk more , but he had to run to make his class . She made the bed , using the Christmas blanket as a bedspread . It gave the chilly room a warm look . She pressed the curtains and rehung them . She prepared her supper . She put two eggs into boiling water , took one out after three minutes and the other out after five . The three-minute one was a little runny ; the fiveminute one , a little on the hard side . Four minutes would be just right , she concluded . I 'll cook them for four minutes forever now . Who said cooking was hard ? She had the boiled eggs , stewed prunes , the three-for-two coffee , and a slice of bread for supper . She was proud of her supper . It will make a fine breakfast too , she decided . She put coal in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in the dime store the next day and would go directly to their new home from there , she said her good-bys to Mrs. Hansmon . It was a tearful farewell . She embraced her and wept when the landlady said she 'd miss having Annie to talk to . Annie promised faithfully to visit her , and the landlady said they could have their room back any time on one day 's notice . And for the last time Annie had to run around to the grocery store before it closed . " A jar of raspberry jam , Henry , for old time 's sake . " He would n't let her pay for it , for old time 's sake . They parted again , as if forever , with a warm handshake . She took off her locket and asked Carl to put it on again as he had done on their wedding night , and she asked to be rocked for the last time in their room . He suggested she take a bath first . Her hands were grimy with coal dust . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she explained . And why had n't she picked up each one with a piece of paper ? Because she had n't thought of it ,  | she said . A person could n't be born knowing everything , could they ? She was so long in the bathroom that Carl started to worry . She had looked so tired , supposing she had fallen asleep in the tub full of water ? Supposing . . . He rushed down the hall to the bathroom . He pounded on the locked door and begged her to open it . She opened it suddenly and he all but fell into the room . The water was out of the tub , but there was a black ring around it . She was getting it off with toilet tissue because she did n't want to ruin the landlady 's towel . He helped her . They used up most of the roll . He rocked her and patted her and she told him in detail of the happenings of the day . He listened . The rise and fall of her lowpitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl , today I learned to cook ! " she said triumphantly . " Thas good , " he said drowsily . It took Carl some time to get used to one kitchen window curtained in blue checked gingham and the other in red . But Annie was proud of the curtains and bet that she was the only one in the world who had curtains like that and Carl said he was sure of it . They lived in the kitchen to save fuel , closing off the other unheated rooms . The bedroom was always ice-cold , and they tried wearing Carl 's Christmas underwear in bed but that did n't work out . The woolen material made Annie itch , and her constant scratching kept him awake and he had to abandon his because the buttons on the back flap dug into his back . They showered together in adjoining stalls in the clubhouse , and Annie was delighted with the shower because there was no bathtub ring to clean up . After a thorough rubdown , they dressed and raced each other back to the cottage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie learned to cook simple , uncomplicated meals . Usually she put everything in the oven early in the afternoon and let the  | food cook until suppertime . She was adamant about one thing , however . She refused to fry anything . She would n't even have lard in the house because the smell of grease reminded her of Mr. Felix and his turtle soup . Things were easier for Carl . He had given up his cafeteria job because they could get along all right with his five dollars a week paper money and Annie 's two dollars from the dime store . He was able to do most of his studying in the hours the cafeteria job had taken . Most days he was home at four o'clock  --  at the latest five . He thumbtacked a notice on the bulletin board that he was available for tutoring at fifty cents an hour . With mid-year exams coming up , there were quite a few frat men who could use a little tutoring , and Carl made a couple of extra dollars . Everything was just fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | In the excitement of moving and fixing up the cottage and meeting new people , Annie had had little time to be concerned . A day or two late ? It had happened before , had n't it ? Ah ! But she had n't been married then ! This was different . When she was two weeks overdue , she began to worry . Her first impulse was to tell Carl , but his mid-year exams were coming up and the news might throw him off his studies . And maybe it was all a mistake and things would adjust themselves the next month and she would have upset Carl for nothing at all . Two weeks late did n't necessarily mean she was pregnant . It could be a mistake ; it had to be a mistake . Things were going so well . They had their own little home , they had their meals together , more time together ; they could get along fine on their joint earnings of seven dollars a week , and she was about to audit the class in playwriting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Please , God , she prayed , do n't let it happen . Not right now . Give us a year of grace . Just one year . And I 'll never ask You for another thing as long as I live . And I promise to give up my writing forever if only You . . .  | Mr. Haise treated Annie like a registered student working for a degree . It was a small , rather informal class . Teacher and students sat together in the front of the room and talked drama . They talked about plays and playwriting and theme and characterization , crisis and climax , titles and curtain lines , and about dialogue  --  especially dialogue . They were like friends spending a social hour together , and Annie enjoyed it . She took to the medium heart , soul , and mind . Dialogue came easy to her . In the play form her short , often unfinished sentences were an asset rather than a drawback . She had an instinct for characterization and a sure feeling about building up to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A whole new world of reading opened to her ; she read all the plays she could get hold of . Her favorites were The Lower Depths and Riders to the Sea . She all but memorized the latter play . She could n't keep the book out forever , so she copied the play word for word and clipped it into her loose-leaf book . Yes , she had promised her God that she would n't write if . . . But He wo n't mind , she thought , if I copy someone else 's play . Near the middle of February she knew she was pregnant . Her first instinct was to keep it secret from Carl , give him less months of worry . Her condition would not be obvious until summer , and he would , by then , have completed his third year . But she had to see a doctor  --  not for her sake but for the sake of the unborn baby . She 'd just have to tell him . Maybe it would n't be too bad . She could continue working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Carl would have finished his next to last year . He could get a steady job in the summer . But what about his last year ? The baby would come in the autumn . Carl could n't possibly get through his last critical year with the burden of a wife and child to support . Well , they 'd have the summer together and when the last year started she 'd go home to have her baby . But how could she go home ? There was Dan . She winced in- wardly at the hearty off-color remarks he 'd be sure to make about her pregnancy . Even if she could put up with him , would her mother take her in ? She could hear her mother saying , " You made your bed , now lay in it . " Or : " I told you and told you . But no ! You would n't listen . Go back to your husband . It 's his place to take care of you and support you and the baby . Not mine . " Annie heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama , I wo n't get in the way . I wo n't fight with Dan . I 'll mind the boys so you and Dan can go out nights . I 'll do all the housework and the cooking . I know how , now . And , Mama , I love you . And you got to love me . " The other alternative was that Carl drop out of school for a year . But if he did , how could he go back ? All the money he could earn that year would be used up for living expenses , doctor bills , hospital bills , and all the things a baby needed . There 'd be no money left over to finance the last year in school . And even if he could get back after a year away  --  even if he could ! Would he be able to take up where he had left off ? Carl was not a variable person . He had made  --  was still making  --  a hard push to be a lawyer . Away from school he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great push of his life would be diverted from law to the adequate support of his wife and child . No ! He 'd have to finish school and she 'd have to go back home . That was the only way . She 'd have to tell him right away . How was the best way to tell him ? What could she say to lighten the news ? It was Annie 's theory that there were compensations to everything . The way she thought of it was : Every cloud has a silver lining . And this had been brought home to her very vividly in The Lower Depths and Riders to the Sea . In Lower Depths , when the people got as low down as they could possibly get , there was the compensation that they could n't get any lower . In Riders to the Sea : They 're all gone now , and there is n't anything more the sea can do to me.  | Yes , Maurya would n't have to cry and pray any more when the storms came over the seas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was her compensation . But what compensation was there for Carl ? For her ? There was the big wonderful compensation for both  --  that a human being would be created out of their love , a living soul to love and protect ; a new life to guide . And , dreamed Annie , I 'll read to her every day until she can read for herself because I want her to grow up to be a reading girl . And colors . I 'll get a water color set and put the brush in her little hand and guide it and let her make a mark on the paper and I 'll tell her , " This is blue , darling , like the sky . And this is red , like a rose is red . " But what about small , individual compensations ? As for her , she did n't have to worry any more as to whether she was or was n't pregnant . Now she knew ! And that was a sort of relief . And she could write again ! Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always urging her to write a play . I 'll write a one-act play and call it The Marriage . That judge with his big stomach will make a fine character and the businesslike clerk . And I 'll use Miss Aggie for Miss Vi  --  the way Miss Aggie talks a lot and all . And I 'll direct that the stage be in two parts . One part will have only a counter to show it is the judge 's office . The play will start there . Then I 'll direct that the lights go down there and come up on the other side where there is a kitchen table and chairs and two little boys are eating oatmeal , and there 's the girl and her mother and the stepfather , and by the way they talk you will find out why the girl left home at eighteen . That will give the girl compassion and . . . Annie had two compensations now . But it was sure hard to find a compensation for Carl . She thought of the contraceptives . She knew Carl hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That could be a small compensation . And the money they 'd save , not having to buy . . .  | Suddenly she laughed aloud . It was a hysterical laugh . Imagine , she thought , thinking about a thing like that ; about saving a few pennies at a time like this ! She made up her mind to tell Carl that night . His exams were over and tomorrow was Saturday and he 'd have no classes . First she would prepare a nice supper and then she 'd tell him . She bought two pork chops and two apples for a pie at the grocery store . She bought a fresh tomato . It was a luxury at ten cents , but how pleased Carl would be ! As usual , the woman , the child on her hip , said nothing . On an impulse , Annie said , " Would you let me hold him for a minute ? I have n't held a baby since I was a little girl . I 'd like to know again how it feels . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hold him and keep him . " But she gave the baby an " umph " kiss before she turned him over . " His name is Lester . But we call him Less . " The child tried his best to get into the saddle , but Annie did n't have enough hip . She was still a slender twenty-two around the waist . The baby twined his legs about it and grabbed her tight around the neck like a monkey in a tree . He stared into her ear and then tried to get his nose into it . Failing , he gave her ear a thorough licking with his tongue . Annie laughed , the woman smiled , and the man behind the meat counter looked up for ' a second . " Tell me , Mrs. Lopin , " said Annie . " How does a girl , a woman , who 's never had a baby before , know for sure she 's going to have a baby ? " The woman came directly to the point . " Do you throw up mornings ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a hard birth , then . " As if she had said too much and was angry at herself , the woman jerked the baby out of Annie 's arms . But she did walk to the door with Annie . " Listen , missus . . . " She paused .  | " Wo n't you call me Annie ? Please ? " " Well , listen , Annie . You want to know anything , ask me . " " Oh , thank you . I 've been dying to talk to someone about it . I have n't even told my husband . You 're the first one I 've told . " The woman thought that over before she said , " My name is Goldie  --  after my hair , you know . " She patted her pretty blond hair . Annie hugged her packages all the way home . We 're friends ! she thought . Now I have a friend . That is three silver linings I got out of that dark cloud . Carl came home in great high spirits . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What , Carl ? " " I made straight A 's on all my exams ! " He lifted her off her feet and swung her around . He put her down and held her at arm 's length . " And guess what else . " " Tell me . " " I made the Dean 's List ! " " Is that something important ? " " It 's a great honor . The Dean called me in to his office and shook my hand and called me Carl . You know , last year , before you were here , I had all the time in the world to study and did n't have to worry too much about money , and I never could make the Dean 's List ? The Dean said you were an influence  --  a good influence , he said . " It 's going to be awful hard to tell him , thought Annie . Awful hard ! She squeezed the baked potatoes until they gave way and opened enough to accept a lump of butter . She sprinkled paprika over them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants . The pork chops were baked just right and the chilled tomato slices ! Carl became quite lyrical about them . And the cinnamon-spiced apple pie ! How did Annie ever guess that was the way he liked apple pie ? And was there some more of that good coffee ? There  | was . And could he have another piece of that pie ? Or was she saving it for tomorrow ? She was n't . Replete with food , he leaned back in his chair and sighed happily . " If life could always be like this ; like this clay  --  this hour . I would n't ask for more . I 'd rather have this than be governor . I ca n't tell him tonight , she thought in anguish . No ! Not tonight . She shook her head sadly . He put his hand on hers . " What , sweetheart ? What 's troubling you ? Tell me . " " Nothing . I was just thinking . . . Carl , while I 'm working tomorrow , why do n't you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying myself while you 're working . " " You owe yourself something getting those high marks and getting on that list . Take advantage . " " Tell you what . I 'll skate for an hour or so and meet you at the dime store when you 're through and we 'll eat supper out so you wo n't have to cook after being on your feet all day . " " We* eat at the cafeteria . I 'd like to see Mrs. Ridinski again . " " Good ! Oh , I meant to tell you , she lives in Lopin . Maybe you could go and see her sometime on her day off . " " I 'd like to . Where does she live ? " " We 'll ask her when we see her . " Helping her with the dishes , he said , " You know I 'll miss all this when we have to go back to Mrs. Hansmon 's a couple of weeks from now ? " T hat 's when I 'll tell him , she decided . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start with . Might as well add on the news of the baby then . She waited out the two weeks until they 'd be told that they 'd have to vacate the cottage . In the meantime she wrote her oneact play about the wedding . It was the first play turned in that semester , and when Mr. Haise read it aloud in class , it sounded pretty good to Annie . She had a new kind of thrill when the class  | laughed at something funny that Miss Chip , alias Miss Aggic , said . Mr. Haise told the class that the standard set by this first submitted play was high , and he hoped the playwright could sustain it . Annie ran all the way home to meet this challenge by writing another play . The setting was a slum street in Brooklyn ; ? the characters , a couple of derelicts , names unknown , who slept in various tenement cellars  --  a different one each night so they would n't be caught  --  and begged pennies on the street , pretending they were blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely criticized and , , 11 what was worse , laughed at . The title , Callous Flesh , got a big laugh when a student said it sounded like a play about a bunion . The curtain line got a bigger laugh . One of the derelicts had been found dead in a cellar and had been brought up and laid II , out on the sidewalk . A man in the crowd surrounding the corpse said , " Well , we all got to go someday . " Curtain . Annie was bitterly humiliated , and ashamed too . Mr. Haise had a hard time getting the class in order . " I am going to be very severe , " he said , " because I know the writer is capable of better work . " Capable of better work ! Annie 's humiliation lightened a bit . " The play is derivative , " he said . " It is an inept imitation of The Lower Depths . " Annie wished the floor would open up so that she could fall through and disappear . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . " The two do not mix well . However , " and here Annie 's heart lifted a little , " the dialogue is authentic . " Annie held on to that little crumb of praise : The dialogue is authentic . Self-criticism replaced shame . She realized she 'd been too self-confident  --  had assumed she knew all there was to know about playwriting . But I 've still got lots to learn , she concluded . And I will learn . By the end of the semester . . . But would she be able to finish the semester ? When her pregnancy became obvious she 'd have to drop out . A pregnant woman just would n't fit in a class of raucous young men and curious  | girls . How much time did she have to learn how to write a oneact play ? " Goldie , when will I show ? " she asked the grocery woman . " Five months . " Annie counted . That would make it the month of May . I wo n't be able to finish , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're so skinny it wo n't show till six months . " June ! She might make it at that . " Honest , Goldie ? " " You heard me say it . " Annie patted the baby 's backside . " Your mother made me very happy , " she told him . Annie went to class , the library , stopped in to see Mrs. Hansmon once in a while and did not neglect Henry . Once or twice she dropped in at the florist shop for five minutes to check on the progress of The Rape of the Forest . To Carl she seemed quieter . She did n't talk to him so much ? did n't ask him so many questions . It was as if he were losing her somehow . His old fear . I should n't encourage her so much in this playwriting business , he thought . That 's one way of losing a wife . Then he was ashamed of the thought . February ended with a premature warm spell . The snow melted , there was more sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked her if she knew where the coach was . That night she told Carl that the new coach must have arrived . Carl said it was sure going to be a hell of a job carrying all those books back to Mrs. Hansmon 's . Annie wondered whether the junk man would buy back the rocker . " I wonder why we have n't heard from that principal , " she said . " I 'll see him tomorrow . I 've got to know because I have to see about getting back my cafeteria job . " " Will you be sorry to leave here , Carl ? "  | " You know I will . But I was prepared for it . Being prepared for something takes some of the curse off it . " There was some truth in that , she thought . Maybe she ought to try to prepare him for the baby . " Carl , suppose someday  --  just suppose , mind you  --  I told you I was going to have a baby , what would be the first thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say , damn those cut-rate drugstores . " He grinned . I wonder , she thought . It turned cold again in late afternoon . She was starting to prepare supper when the phone rang . From the kitchen she heard Carl say , " How are you , Mr. Lopin ? I was planning on seeing you tomorrow about the new coach . " Annie went into the chilly living room to stand next to Carl . She heard the muffled rise and fall of the principal 's voice but could n't make out what he was saying . After a long time of listening , Carl said , ' Why , that 's fine , Mr. Lopin . Just fine ! " More listening before Carl said , " I 'd be glad to , Mr. Lopin , and we sure appreciate it . " Some more of Mr. Lopin 's muffled voice , then Carl 's " Thanks a lot . Good-by , Mr. Lopin . " He hung up the receiver and turned to Annie , all smiles . " What do you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new coach has a wife and three kids and the cottage is too small for him . So Mr. Lopin said we could stay as long as we want ! Of course I 'll have to do a little work around the place ? keep the field in order , clean up the clubhouse , and take tickets when there 's a game , and ... " Now ! thought Annie . Now ! This is the time to tell him . Get it over with . " Carl , I 'm going to have a baby . " He misunderstood . " Sure , I know you want a baby . But let 's not start one right away . We have time . Wait until I 'm in practice . " She started to tremble . It was going to be harder than she had thought .  | " Look at you shivering ! Why do you wear thin summer dresses in this cold house ? What 's the matter with your woolen skirt and sweater ? " " I have to save them for my class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was warm and rubbed her cold hands , trying to stop what he thought was her shivering . " Carl , listen to me . Please listen . I am pregnant . " She raised her voice . " Pregnant ! Do you understand ? " He dropped her hands and moved back a step . " What did you say ? " he asked , bewildered . " I am going to have a baby ! " He said what many another husband had said : " Are you sure ? " " I am two months on the way . " " I see , " he said quietly . " Well . . . I 'll be right back , sweetheart . I have to check the furnace . " The locker-room furnace did not need checking , but Carl wanted to be alone a few minutes to think things out . He sat on one of the narrow benches and did some very hard thinking . How could it have happened ? I took care . It 's going to be tough . Very tough . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ? The poor little thing  --  keeping it all to herself ! Well , I 've got to take hold now . I must n't let her worry . He hurried back to the cottage . " Why did n't you tell me , sweetheart ? I had a right to know . You should n't protect me so much . I 'm a man , not a kid any longer . I 'm your husband , not your son . " " I was afraid you 'd worry . " " I worry anyhow . Let me have something important to worry about . You feel all right ? " he asked suddenly . " I feel fine . " " And you want the baby ? " " So much ! I can hardly wait ! " " That 's good , sweetheart . Now I 'll figure out what ? " " I have it all worked out , Carl , " she interrupted . " We 'll be  | together until September . Then I 'll go home and have my baby and you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dorm again . We 'll be apart only a year and I 'll write to you every day and . . . " Suddenly she broke down and wept . She put her arms around him . " But I do n't want to go back , " she sobbed . " I want to stay with you . . . I want to stay with you . " She could n't control her sobs . He pretended anger as an antidote . " Cry-sake , Annie , what do you mean by making foolish plans without asking me ? You 'll do this  --  you 'll do that ! What are you trying to do ? Take my manhood away from me ? At least give me a chance to handle things . " Her sobbing subsided . " Come sit on my lap , sweetheart . " He rocked her and patted her until she calmed down and relaxed with a shuddering sigh . " Listen , sweetheart , you are not going back to your mother . You are my wife and you belong to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dorm . I want to live with you . Ah , Annie , I could n't get along without you  --  without talking to you  --  without sleeping with you . . . without . . . " But how can we ... " " Be quiet . I 'll take care of everything from now on . " She was quiet awhile before she said , " But , Carl , you did n't say anything about my baby . " " I ca n't quite take it in yet . I 've only known for ten minutes about it . You 've known for two months . You kept it all to yourself . Yes , you shut me out . And you 're still doing that . You act as though it 's all yours : My baby , you keep saying . I 'm going to have a baby . Never our baby or we 're going to have a baby . Remember it will be mine as much as yours . " " I do n't mean I own it by myself , Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her voice seemed tired . You feel all right , Annie ? " he asked anxiously . " I feel wonderful . " " So I 'm going to be a father ! How about that ! It 's just begin- ping to get through to me . The more I think of it the better I like it . The idea of having a son of my own . . . " " Our own . If it 's a girl , I hope she looks like you because you 're prettier than I am . " " You know , Annie , I feel like celebrating . " " Too bad we 're fresh out of champagne . But I tell you what : Go get a bottle of near-beer while I fix supper . And get one for me , too . The Germans say beer is good for a baby . " " Nothing to that . Just propaganda to sell surplus beer . " " Get me a Coke , then . " Preparing to leave , he said , " You 'll be all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " From now on I want you to take special care of yourself . Do n't overdo . Let the housework go . " " Carl ? Will you tell me not to move heavy furniture ? " " Especially heavy furniture . Do n't move any heavy furniture . " " Thank you , Carl . " Her eyes filled with tears . " I wanted somebody to say that to me so bad . "  | " Yes , I grant you that , " said the Dean . ' We do have some married students . But they are mature men whose wives have already completed their own education and have well-paying work which enables them to support a husband . Or they are financed by their parents . The question as to whether they are eligible for financial aid does not come up . " " But , sir , " said Carl , " there is a definite trend toward early student marriages . Man and wife go to college together , or marry while still in school . " " Yes . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of school because of financial difficulties . " " But , sir , nowhere in The General Catalogue does it specify that a married student may not apply for a loan . " Carl had the catalogue with him . He read from it : " Financial aid for tuition and necessary textbooks is available to almost every student who can show superior academic achievement and definite financial need . " Carl closed the book . " I believe I qualify , sir . " " You overlooked the word almost , ' Carl . Available to almost every student . . . That one word almost ' means we may discriminate if we see fit . "  | " If you 'll pardon me , sir , almost ' is an ambiguous word . " ' True . I 'll call it to the attention of the editors . " I believe that I qualify academically . " " No question about it . " " I also qualify under definite financial need . " Carl swallowed hard . " My wife is going to have a child . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie 's going to have a baby ? " he asked increduously . " In September , sir . " " But she 's a mere child herself . " " She 'll be nineteen this fall . " " Has she seen a doctor ? " " Not yet , sir . " " That should be attended to immediately . I suggest Dr. Marson . He 's the best gynecologist in the state . He 's on the School of Medicine faculty but retains a small private practice . " The Dean picked up his pencil and asked Carl what time he was free the next day . Carl 's last class was at three . " Good ! I 'll arrange an appointment for three-thirty . " He wrote the time on a pad , then carefully arranged the pencil on top of the pad . He was silent for a long time . Carl broke the silence . " I shall not be able to register for my last year , sir , without a tuition and textbook loan . " " Tell me , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " " You were married in the state . I take it your child will be born in the state . " " Of course . And I 'll cast my first vote in this state . I 'll be twenty-one the latter part of next month . " " Good ! I believe you qualify as a state resident . This is a state university . I like to believe we take care of our own . Tuition fees are lower for state residents and I am certain a loan can be arranged . Three per cent interest and ten years to pay . " Carl 's sudden relief made him almost incoherent in thanking  | the Dean . He thanked him for putting him on his list , for the cottage , the doctor , the loan  --  for Annie 's class . The Dean frowned and raised his hand in a " stop " signal . " I 'm told , " he said , " that Annie is a great asset to the class in playwriting . I hope she will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Carl . " I am pleased to know that . Too bad she can not forge ahead . She seems to have so many potentialities for . . . " He left the sentence unfinished . " Good luck , Carl , " he said abruptly . He picked up the telephone . Carl was dismissed . Carl chain-smoked in the waiting room while Dr. Marson gave Annie the preliminary examination ; lungs , heart , blood pressure , reflexes , and so on . When he had finished , the nurse took Annie into a cool cubicle , had her undress and helped her onto the table . She draped a sheet over Annie 's nakedness , told her to relax and left , saying the doctor would see her in a few minutes . Annie had never had a complete physical examination . In fact , she had never been to a doctor except for something trivial  --  a cinder in her eye , a wart to be removed , a vaccination and other minor things . She had never been examined while naked . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed by the nurse . " Now , Mrs. Brown , " he said cheerfully , " let 's see you slide down to the bottom of the table with your knees raised . That 's it ! All the way now . That 's good . Now put your feet in the stirrups . " Annie did n't know where the stirrups were or what they were , for that matter . The nurse guided her feet into the stirrups . Suddenly the doctor threw back the sheet and spread her legs wide apart . " No ! " Annie cried out . " No ! Do n't ! " She put her legs together and slid back up the table , clutching the sheet about her . " Now , Mrs. Brown , now . . . " said the doctor soothingly . " Maybe she 'll be more relaxed with her husband here , " said the nurse . " I 'll get him . "  | " Do n't get him . Please ! " said Annie . She did not want Carl to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor says . " She assumed the position . " That 's a good girl , " said the doctor . The nurse handed him an instrument . Annie flinched at the first impact of the cold instrument on her inner flesh . " I know it 's a position of great indignity , " said the doctor , " but it 's necessary . " Indignity . It was a new word to Annie . It sounds exactly like what it means , thought Annie . Soon it was over and the doctor left . The nurse helped her off the table . " There , that was n't too bad , now , was it ? " said the nurse . " No , " lied Annie . " Doctor wants to see you and your husband in his office when you 've finished dressing . " Carl was waiting for her in the corridor . Mutely she took his hand and held it tight as they went into the office . " Your wife is in her third month of pregnancy , " said the doctor cheerfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to worry about there . " Annie was alerted at the word " there . " " Of course , she has a very narrow pelvis . " Annie felt a quiver of fear . " But I do n't think that will give us too much trouble . " He gave instructions : Check with the dentist . . . lots of milk . . . for calcium that the baby takes away from a mother . Do everything she was accustomed to doing , but at the first sign of exhaustion lie down and rest . Diet ? As usual . But avoid fattening foods . " We want a small baby , " he said . Again Annie felt that quiver of fear . Carl asked his fee . " My fee , Mr. Brown ? Fifty dollars . " The doctor saw Annie and Carl exchange looks . " But do n't worry about it . Pay as we go along . Or take a year . I can wait . "  | " How much for the hospital ? " asked Carl . " Private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gasping sound . " However , I prefer my patients to go to the University Hospital . " " That ten dollars a day , too ? " asked Annie . " No charge , except for anesthetics , special diets . . . " Carl and Annie beamed at each other . " Provided , " he continued , " provided you permit two of my graduate students  --  interns  --  to observe the birth process from beginning to end . Perhaps to assist . . . " " I do n't want any student to experiment on my wife , " said Carl quickly . " No , no ! I 'll deliver the baby . The boys may help out in routine things . . . checking during preliminary labor , pulse so on . " Annie ? " said Carl , indicating that the decision was hers to make . Ten dollars a day , she figured . Ten days a hundred dollars . Where would we get the money ? she thought . " I guess I would n't mind , Carl , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor . " You 're sure , Annie ? " asked Carl . " I 'm sure . I trust Dr. Marson because the Dean recommended him . " The doctor put his hand over Annie 's . " Ah , thank you , Mrs. Brown . " I 'd feel more at home , though , doctor , if you 'd call me Annie . " " Annie it is then , " he said . " I 'll take good care of you , Annie . "  | Spring in the Middle West , wrote Annie , does not come all of a sudden as if it had been waiting all the time around the corner . No . It takes a long time to get ready . First , it has to clean up after Winter . " You got any snow left , old man , " Spring says to Winter , " you get rid of it now because it wo n't keep until next year . And make it snappy ! I want to move in . " Then it snows like it never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's Winter 's last howl . Winter is pretty tired by then  --  getting rid of all that snow  --  and he limps up north to join other Winters waiting there . Then Spring hollers : " Hey , Sun ! Let 's go ! " Sun leans down and breathes hard on Snow and makes it change into water . First , Water fills people 's basement , then the street gutters . Then it fills up the river . " Take it easy , Spring , will you ? " says River . " I 'm getting high on water . I can take just so much and no more . " The Old-timers say , " Worst flood in years ! It 's in all the papers . Spring says , " Okay , Sun . That 's it ! Get lost for a few days . "
