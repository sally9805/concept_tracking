txt Substantial salary increases for approximately 100 city commissioners , deputy commissioners and other top officials are recommended in a report now under study by Mayor Wagner and City Administrator Charles H. Tenney . The report was submitted by the Institute of Public Administration , of which Lyle C. Fitch , a former City Administrator , is president . It is based upon a study for which the city will pay $15,750 . It was estimated yesterday that the recommendations , if followed , would add from $500 , - 000 to $750,000 to the city payroll for top executives . Details Are Secret Details of the report have been kept secret , although it has been in the hands of the Mayor and other top city officiftis for several weeks . It is known , however , that it recommends a $10,000 increase in the salaries of some department heads now receiving $25,000 or less . A reliable source indicted that annual salaries of $35,000 Were recommended , for example , for the posts now held by Police 1Commissioner Michael .1 . Murphy , Welfare Comm issionei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Board of Estimate restricted the study to executive positions under the jurisdiction of the Mayor and the five Borough Presidents . The study was voted in June , about seven months after the board had voted , without btrneftt ' W.- research , a raise of $10,000 for each of its members , effective Jan. 1 , 1962 . Election Discourages Action Some city officials who know of the Institute of Public Administration 's report , doubt that it will be implemented , if at all , until after the Nov. 6 election . They express the fear that even after Election Day there will be a long delay in the voting of executive raises . The strong , persistent pressure of ' large groups of Civil Service employes for raises for themselves , it is felt , will keep the Mayor and his fiscal advisers from distributing any substantial salary increase among executives now receiving from $15,000 to $27,500 a year . Many city commissioners , deputy commissioners , bureau heads and other top executives have been hopeful of raises since the Mayor included in his 1960-61 expense budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only for them but also for judges of the local courts . The increases for judges were provided promptly , but only a handful of top city of-1 ficials got any raises , About $300,000 of the original $640,000 appropriation has been carried into the current expense budget . It will be available to meet part of the cost , should the Mayor and the Board , of Estimate follow the recommendations made by the Institute of Public Administration , Before including in his 1960-61 expense budget the $640,000 item for executive and judicial raises , the Mayor had publicly expressed fear that some of his outstanding commissioners and their aides might be lost because of better pay offered by private enterprise . Last May the Citizens Committee for Children sent the Mayor a letter , warning him that failure to remedy " explosive and dangerous inequities " in salaries for commissioners and their staffs might well cost the city the services of " our most valuable top people . " The letter said the salaries paid by the city in such im- , portant areas as health , mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below those paid by the state . The civic organization noted that inadequate salaries for depart- , ment heads necessarily kept be- , low a proper level the pay for key professionals
