Something in all living things responds mysteriously to the sound of wind in the reeds . At the gentle pleasing of a flute , certain crabs glide out of their caves and sit listening under water . Mosquitoes of some breeds collect on people playing flutes . Lions fly into panic , dogs sink into bliss-though only when the flute is played in the key of C minor . In China , the musk deer is hunted with a Judas flute , which the deer meekly follows to its doom . <P> People respond to the flute too , and of late with special reason : the world is now entering the golden age of the flute . Never in history has " the metal nightingale " been so highly esteemed as a solo instrument ; never in one period has it been played by so many virtuoso performers . In the U.S. and Europe , there are at least 30 first-rate flutists-London 's Geoffrey Gilbert and William Bennett , Manhattan 's John Wummer and Samuel Baron , Rochester 's Joseph Mariano , Boston 's Doriot Anthony Dwyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them there are four who may well belong among the great flute players of all time . <P> JULIUS BAKER , 52 , first flutist of the New York Philharmonic , last week played the intricate trills in Mendelssohn 's oratorio Elijah as casually as another man might whistle for a taxi . A plump , dapper , matter-of-fact chap who looks and acts like a prosperous dentist , Baker is short on temperament but long on technique . He is the supreme mechanic of his instrument , and he produces what is surely the most glorious tone that ever came out of a flute : big , round , cool , white , radiant as a September moon . <P> JEAN-PIERRE RAMPAL , 44 , the most famous French flutist of the age , this week had a concert date in Paris to play Mozart 's Concerto for Flute in D Major . A large man with a suave stage presence , Rampal can not make the flute sing as Baker can , but he does make it speak with a wonderfully expressive French accent . He is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience as a fakir charms a snake . <P> AURELE NICOLET , 40 , Rampal 's leading rival , last week started a ten-concert tour of Israel . A slender , clear-eyed man whose art is often touched with a quality of rapture , Nicolet is a poet of the flute who may well become its greatest virtuoso . While Rampal stands always a little aside from the piece he is playing , Nicolet knows how to yield to the music and enter more deeply into its being . Rampal is a magnificent mannerist , Nicolet the profounder stylist . <P> SEVERING GAZZELONI , 47 , the grand master of the difficult contemporary repertory , this week begins a monthlong concert tour that will take him from Copenhagen to Tripoli to Minneapolis . Fidgety and ferret-bright , Gazzeloni started noodling around with atonal music about 20 years ago , got fascinated when he found that in order to play the new music he had to dispense with the traditional flute technique and develop a new one . After several years of experiment , he developed one that permits him to cacophonize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters , but it reveals an exciting and significant new function of the flute .
