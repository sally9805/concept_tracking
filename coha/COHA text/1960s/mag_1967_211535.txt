PRESIDENT JOHNSON was unusually clear and precise in explaining his views about Viet Nam at his press conference last week . Herewith the pertinent quotes . <P> On Conditions for Talks : " We are ready to speak , unconditionally or conditionally , and the problem with all of those who love peace - and I think most of us do - is not with this Government . We 're willing to go to a conference room any day . We are ready to go without stopping the bombing , or after stopping , if they are willing to do likewise , or if they are willing to make any concession . But I do n't think it 's fair to ask an American commander in chief to say to your men , ' Ground your planes , tie your hands behind you , and sit there and watch division after division come across the DMZ demilitarized zone , and do n't hit them until they get within a mile or two of you . ' I do n't think that 's fair to American Marines or American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . We did that in Korea . We had the blockade on in Berlin while we had conferences . So we 're willing to talk unconditionally , or conditionally . All we ask is equity and fairness , and that the other side do likewise . We do n't think you ought to ask American boys to do one thing , while the other folks do nothing . " <P> On the Conduct of the War : " I no longer see any possibility of military victory on the part of North Viet Nam . I think they realize it . I think they 're struggling desperately today to try to get a propaganda victory and to try to bring world opinion and public opinion in this country to permit them to win here what they can not win from our men out there . " <P> On a Bombing Pause : " We 've had five pauses now . We 've heard the same story every time . I see nothing that would give me any indication that they 've had a change of mind or that they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> On the Soviet Role : " I believe that the Russians generally want peace . I think that most people in the world want peace . Some want it on different terms , and I 'm hoping that the day will come when we can find some area of agreement , but I do n't think that that day is here yet . " <P> On Reciprocity : " I do n't want to quarrel with anyone . I think it 's rather clear to me that they the North Vietnamese have laid down conditions that to me mean that they insist that we agree to permanent cessation of bombing before they might talk . We have said that we would be glad to stop our invasion of North Viet Nam if they would stop their invasion of South Viet Nam . We are prepared to discuss anything that they 're willing to discuss . But they 're not willing to discuss anything as of now . "
