txt BELGIANS ERASING ECONOMIC LOSSES Busy Nation Belies Belief It 1 Is ' Sick Man ' of Europe ? Political Ills Remain By EDWIN L. DALE Jr . Sr/eclat to The New York Times . BRUSSELS , Belgium , Feb. 16 ? Belgium , which is widely believed to he the " sick man " of booming Europe , looks remarkably robust . This industrious country of 9,200,000 inhabitants in an area somewhat larger than Maryland ' has thrown off the economic effects of the loss of the Congo and other troubles with typical agility . It seems on the way toi overcoming some of the slack that developed in the economy . ' by comparison with the rest of Europe , in the latter half of . the ' Nineteen Fifties . Belgium has her troubles , mainly political , and some Belgians delight in talking about them . A particularly contentious press tends to make reasonably good things seem bad and bad things seem worse . They Land on Their Feet Nevertheless , the evidence of the eyes and ears  --  which in this country sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emerging age ' of European affluence Belgium , which started ahead , will not be left behind . Some of the figures are beginning to confirm this evidence . One reason is cited by an experienced banker . " We Belgians are sometimes late and we are not known for always being right , in politics and even business , " he said . " But we are like cats . When we are tossed about , we always seem to land on our feet . " At the moment there are signs that what has been wrong , with the Belgian economy ? in part an overconcentration on the " traditional " industries like steel , glass and cement ? is changing . There no longer is a certain complacency , born in part of the fact that Belgium was the first European country to recover after World War II and lived better than the others for a long time . The European Common Market , with its opening of national frontiers to both competition and opportunity , is clearly one reason for the change . A Belgian business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are the agents here for most of the big American machine tools , " he said , " About 1960 , industry in this country // Busy Belgians Overcoming Economic Loss NATION IS BELYING ' SICK MAN ' IMAGE Recovery Effort Restoring Rank Among Leaders of European Progress // became convinced that the Common Market was going to work and that they had to do something to modernize and meet the competition . Our sales , which had been running regularly at $1,900,000 a year , have nearly quadrupled . " Belgium 's reputation as a " sick man " came about ' for reason 's . First , international comparisons showed that she was the only continental country with a relatively low rate of economic growth during the last eight years  --  a rate of 3 per cent a year or less , which is that of the Western world 's two major laggards , the United States and Britain . In addition , and probably more important , the figures showed that the rate of investment in new plant and equipment had been much lower than elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disruption in the Congo , followed by last winter 's long and bitter political strike at home . Third , there was a chronically large deficit in the budget , Nation 's ' Image ' Found Hubert Ansiaux , Governor of the Bank of Belgium , is a good example of the general change in attitude and atmosphere . Each New Year 's Day he gives a private talk to his staff . On the first day of 1961 he was deeply pesssimistic . Last New Year 's Day he told the staff of his pleasure in being able to report how wrong he had been . Ot course , none of the recent improvement in produrAion , e6xports , investment and the balance of payments alters the fact that Belgium lagged for a sus-1 tained period , For the ordinary , citizen , this had two effects similar to the effects of the growth lag in the United States . First , for as many as 100,000 Belgians it meant unemployment above " normal . " ( The figure can not be precise ; part of it was due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) While countries like West Germany , France , Sweden , Austria and Switzerland were desperately looking for labor , Belgium was desperately looking for job opportunities . Second , the lag meant that wages and other incomes were growing less rapdily than elsewhere for the great majority still employed , Where German workers have ' been receiving each year improvements in wages , shorter working hours and " fringe benefits " worth about 8 cents . an hour , the Belgians ' gains have been closer to 3 cents an hour . Prices rose slightly faster in West Germany , but a large difference remains . However , Belgium has benefited to some extent from her troubles . Booming Antwerp , and towns such as Bruges , Malines and Mons , which have needed industry badly , illustrate why . Reserve of Unemployed Served as Magnet The reserve of unemployed has been a magnet for foreign business . Spurred by this and by unusually favorable tax and credit inducements , seventy-seven concerns from the United States alone established in Belgium last year . From Britain , West Germany , France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures are records . Malines is sometimes called , though with great exaggeration , " Little America . " In Antwerp , large petroleum and chemical investments have already been made , and more big ones are , coming . All the dockside space of a new harbor area that is under construction has been taken in advance . The foreign companies are wanted above all because they provide diversification into the new fields ? petrochemicals , electronics and plastics , for example . Baron Albert Kervyn de Lettenhove , the young economist who heads the small planning staff established two years ago to try to improve economic performance by persuasion and analysis rather than controls , puts the problem this way : " We Belgians have always been very good at some things . Ask us to do almost any piece of metal work and it will be done very well . Even leaving aside our strong basic industries such as steel , we are a nation of expert job shops . " But we have never been much good at making finished products , above all complicated consilmer products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down to the smallest , is imported . " Exports and Imports Run At 40% of Output None of this has anything to do with present availability of goods to the Belgians themselves . The shops have literally everything . Typically for a small industrial country , Belgium exports about 40 per cent of her output and imports an equivalent amount . Imports must be paid for by exports . An " open " country like this must be modern to survive and grow , particularly when its traditional exports such as steel have lost much of their upward momentum . Hence the emphasis on the newer lines of industry . There is no certain evidence that Belgium will be able to make the transformation , though the latest figures indicate a rise in investment . Baron Kervyn , for example , refuses to be carried away by the recent signs of change though he is far from a pessimist . In the meantime , partly because of the new investment , domestic and foreign , and partly because of good business in-Europe , the unemployment has shown a sizable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but : - some authorities put " true " unemployment now at less than 50,000 . People Living Well Despite Low Wages For a long time Belgium was the " high wage " country en the Contirent . The recent lag has allowed West Germany , France and some others to eaten up . By United States standards , of course , wages are extremely ow . One American concern , for example , pays its women workers the equivalent of 59 cents an hour and its men workers 86 cents . Despite the wage levels , the Belgians have a way of living well , by European standards , and almost by American ones . Some prices and nearly all rents Worse Than Reality As it turns out , all three factors gave Belgium an " image " that was worse than the reality . With regard to the first feetor , the growth rate has definitely been lower than elsewhere in Europe , but this is partly because Belgium recovered quickly and was already in an advanced state of industrialization . For example , of the Common Market countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in agriculture : only 10 per cent . As for the investment figures , they have come under severe dispute . The statisticians and economists disagree , but it seems that the Belgians probably were installing new equipment at a more rapid rate than they or outsiders thought . With regard to the second factor , the supposed economic importance of the Congo , this was always an illusion . By any test it never amounted to much . The worst that could have resulted from a complete halt in economic relations , which has not occurred , would have been some trouble for the international balance of payments . The first effects on the balance of payments were felt last year , to the tune of $30,000,000 to $40,000,000 . This was more than offset by improvements elsewhere , including a sizable increase in exports to the Common Market countries . Belgium ran a healthy payments surplus and her gold reserves rose by nearly $100,000,000 . Belgians ' Have Taught Lesson to the World ' The Congo loss did , of course , affect many concerns and citizens . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's savings of $30,000 in Congo shares six months before the disaster saw his capital shrink by 75 per cent in no time . An American company here has taken over the spacious modern office of a former Congo company that has slipped out of sight . The adversities are not the economy of a country , however . The great bulk of Belgians felt strongly about the Congo debacle but went on living and working precisely as before . Similarly , last winter 's general strike had no lasting effect . As for the budget problem , the third factor affecting the " image , " it has had almost no harmful economic effects , although it is serious . " We have taught a lesson to the world , " says a Belgian economist cynically . " If you want to have a stable price level and avoid inflation , run the largest possible budget deficit . " His reference was to the fact that prices in Belgium have been the most stable in the industrial world over the last four years . By various financial devices , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterilized , " and many experts feel that total industrial activity would have been less without them . There have been bad effects on financial confidence , both at home and abroad , but an improvement in the budget situation began last year , and the Government intends it to continue . Lag in Economy Hit Workers Two Ways are lower than in the United States . Many families have more than one wage-earner , and some wage-earners have more than one job . " Do n't talk to me about wage figures , " says an official of the Economics Ministry . " All I know is that car sales are booming , we have about the highest saturation of washing machines , telephones and the like in Europe , and a lot of money is being spent in Europe . " The figures support this sertion . Measured by their consumption of goods and services , the Belgians live better than any other continental Europeans except the Swedes . This was the first country en the Continent to be caught up in the Industrial Revolution early in the nineteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by good luck it was the first to recover after World War II . Now , after a period of troubles , it has no intention of reverting to last place .
