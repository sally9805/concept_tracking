Fashion this fall seems to be the work of the Madwoman of Chaillot . Plus elements of a rummage sale , a fancy-dress party , and that haphazard art form based on " found objects . " <P> The " little nothing " black dress will no longer do , even if it carries a famous designer 's label . Today a woman is expected to design herself , assembling on her body a collage of bright colors , sensuous textures and glittering accessories . There are jeweled vests , billowing felt capes , balloon pants , plus pounds of false jewelry , ribbons , scarves , belts and chains-anything that can be combined to create a fanciful costume of individuality and panache . <P> The new attitude is free and defiant . " I do n't give a damn any longer what people think , " declares Manhattan Career Girl Pam Zauderer , 23 . Not exactly a novel or revolutionary notion . Still , she was raised in Chanel suits picked out by her mother , and she now goes dining and dancing in pants-shaggy fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vogue Editor Diana Vreeland , fringed satin ones for the Indian look at a Four Seasons reception for Yves Saint Laurent . Post-Deb Cathy Macauley , 21 , shows up in Manhattan for the superformal opening of the Metropolitan Opera season wearing black culottes , an extravagantly embroidered red vest and a leash borrowed from her cat as a necklace . " I was going to go barefoot , " says Cathy , " but I guess that 's not right for the opera . " <P> Take-Off Pants . The costume look-or the " rich hippie " look , as it is sometimes known-is not just the prerogative of the young . Socialite-Artist Gloria Vanderbilt Cooper , 44 , is one devotee . Greeting guests at her recent one-woman show in Washington , D.C. , she wore silver lam harem pants , matching vest , rhinestone earrings , ' bracelets , a brooch and six gold rings . " My dressing is a natural extension of my art , " says Gloria , who specializes in collages . <P> Much of the impetus comes from the exotic costumes dreamed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own thing . " The situation has traditional designers up tight . Old standard setters , like Balenciaga , have retired . Others , like Saint Laurent , reach for youth by focusing increasingly on less expensive ready-to-wear clothes . At 46 , fatigued by the efforts that have kept him far ahead of other designers , Rudi Gernreich last week announced that he was taking a year off in order to refresh himself . Says Gernreich , who championed the new attitude all along : " I feel that a woman must buy the basics from a boutique or designer , and then be able to do what she wants with scarves and chains . Women want to involve themselves with their clothes . "
