WEN I arrived in New York in April of 1919 , I soon found the pilots ' hangout was the American Flying Club on East 38th Street . The club was housed in a fine white-front converted residence , filled with mementos , trophies , framed squares of airplane linen salvaged from crashes by famous pilots , wrecked propeller hubs , photographs of the great aces , and a collection of magnificent flight paintings by Faure . The majority of the members had been wartime pilots , but by now they were a varied lot : test pilots ; barnstormers ; a few , like me , who had vague hopes of continuing the exciting and pleasant life we had enjoyed in the service . The club was certainly gay . There was much drinking and gambling . I won enough at craps to keep me reasonably in funds . But I was constantly trying to find a way to get back into flying . I asked around about a flying job , any flying job at all . If you were really desperate , I learned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Mail . What was so dangerous , anyway , I demanded , about flying the mail ? True , the Air Mail was all cross-country flying , much of it over hilly , rough terrain . True , too , the planes , mostly DH-4s and a few Curtiss Rs , all war surplus , had to go in and out of small and unimproved fields instead of military airdromes . Worse , there were only a few mechanics who knew a spark plug from an aileron , and it was about even money that the pilot would have an engine failure on any given flight . But worst of all was the attitude of the Post Office Department . A pilot had to try to get through , regardless of the consequences ; he could n't cancel without giving it a try . Three or four of its pilots , it seemed , had learned to fly some pretty bad weather ; and if those pilots could get through , the P.O. brass figured that the others could . Ruthless , perhaps , but essential if aerial carriage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pop Anglin , who had led the mail pilots in a strike a few months back , when they had rebelled against orders to take off regardless of weather . Although the pilots had won the strike , Pop shook his head solemnly . But he gave me the telephone number of D. B. Colyer , manager of the Post Office Air Mail Service , which had its headquarters at College Park , outside Washington . Colyer seemed delighted at the prospect of hiring a pilot . He asked if I could fly a De Havilland . I said I 'd never had any trouble with the plane . That was true enough , since I had never flown one . He told me to hustle down and he would pay the fare . Even though everyone considered the Air Mail the next thing to suicide , you could at least be comfortable while life lasted . A mail pilot started at $2400 a year ; he got a $200 raise after each fifty hours until he was making $3600 . If assigned to multi-engined planes , like the Martin Bomber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This added up to good money . Such was my rationalization . COLLEGE PARK seemed a most unpretentious show to be the headquarters of the Air Mail Service . There were three or four shacklike wooden hangars , a but for an office , and an exceedingly small , badly rolling , sod field . I was yet to learn that this was a sumptuous airdrome compared with the typical Air Mail field , I located D. B. Colyer . As soon as the southbound got in , he told me , the pilot would check me out in a Jenny . If he gave me an OK , I would be put in a DH to see what I could do . And if I then got down in one piece , I would be in business . While I waited , a mechanic showed me the layout , and I quizzed him anxiously about the switches and valves on the DH . The incoming pilot took little time to check me out . He hustled me into the front seat of the Curtiss trainer , had me take off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . That was all . He gave Colyer a breezy OK and was off . The De Havilland was a challenge , more psychological than actual , but enough to make me nervous as I climbed in for my first flight . The DH had a Liberty engine of 400 horsepower ; its roar made the ground shake . But the mechanic 's lesson proved invaluable , and I carefully followed his instructions . Once clear , I taxied to the corner , pointed the plane the long way of the field , and gave her the gun before I had time to change my mind . The plane took off easily . After a few maneuvers I knew I was flying the plane instead of the plane flying me . There was an exhilaration to flying airplanes in those days : their slow speed and light wing-loadings allowed short turns , sharp dives , and quick pull-outs that are impossible in faster planes . We did not rely on gauges and indicators ; we flew by feel , noting the control pressures on our hands and feet , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the singing wires . I was careful with my first few landings , bringing the DH in flat , with a bit of power until I got over the fence . After a dozen landings I taxied in to find I had become a mail pilot . This was in April , 1920 . The Air Mail operation ? initially , flying from Washington to New York ? had been extended by a route from New York to Chicago and , very recently , as far as Omaha . After several days at College Park , I was given a permanent assignment , based at Bellefonte , Pennsylvania , whence I was to fly to Cleveland . Bellefonte is a borough in the Allegheny Mountains , in Central Pennsylvania . I checked in with a Mr. Tanner , the field manager , and asked him what I was to do . So far as he knew , he said , I had only to fly back and forth to Cleveland . Never having been to Cleveland , I asked him for maps . He smiled . There were no maps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind someone who knew the run . When Max Miller , the senior pilot of the dozen or so in the Air Mail Service , showed up , I asked him how to get started . Rand McNally road maps , he explained , were useful , but they did n't show the landmarks I would use most in flying the run , such as the shape and layout of the towns , the distinctive appearance of the hills and valleys , the low places that let you work your way through weather , and the location of possible landing fields . After I came to know my run , Miller said , I would fly to Cleveland just as I would walk to the drugstore ; I would know the way . Miller and I picked up maps of Pennsylvania and Ohio . Then he began to talk . He kept on talking for a long time . From the field here at Bellefonte you head west through the gap in the ridge . Climb as you veer a bit north , passing over the center of a railroad switchback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to clear the top of the ridge at , say , 2200 feet . After about ten miles you hit the railroad again at Snow Shoe ? look sharp , it 's only four or five houses ? then follow the railroad on down the other side of Rattlesnake to the valley , where you pick up the West Branch of Susquehanna River , winding along to the town of Clearfield , which you will know by three round water reservoirs just south of town , Next , you have to get over about thirty miles of plateau to On Bois . This is pretty high , about 2500 feet , but it is fairly smooth on top , and there is a white gravel road cut through the trees straight to Du Bois . As you come into town you will see the railroad to your right , and just south of the railroad , a piece of flat pasture you can land on in a pinch . Then the highway leads you for fifty miles through Brookville to Clarion . Each of these towns has a half mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of trees , but the one at Brookville is clean and hard , and it 's the best emergency field from here to Cleveland . As soon as you land you will be met by a girl named Alice Henderson , driving a big Cadillac , who will be pleased to look after you . After Clarion , the country gradually gets lower until you cross the Allegheny at Franklin , which you can identify by a big S bend in the river . From then on , it 's clear sailing . And so he went on , naming towns , hills , rivers , roads , factories , race tracks , all the way to Cleveland . The airfield was in East Cleveland , at the Glenn L. Martin plant . It was easy to find , just a quarter of a mile from the lake shore ? or so Miller assured me . IHAD expected to make my first trip escorted by one of the Cleveland pilots . But within a few days the westbound came in , and there was no pilot except me available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from promising ; it had been raining off and on all day , and low clouds were barely clearing the ridges . However , no one seemed concerned as the mail was transferred to my DH and the Liberty was warmed up , so I took off and headed west through the gap in the first ridge . Max 's instructions proved a great help . I made it over Rattlesnake Mountain and followed the river to Clearfield without much trouble . Opaque veils of cloud forced me to twist and dodge my way between them as the squalls grew heavier . By the time I reached the slope leading up to the plateau , the clouds were so solid that I had to circle back . I hated to give up . When I got back to Clearfield again , the sky looked brighter to the north , so I blithely headed that way , happily ignorant that I was flying over some of the wildest country in Pennsylvania , high and rugged , with few houses and no fields for fifty miles around . I was able to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , zigzagging from one to another . I knew I was north of the course , but not how far north ; I knew I was working west , but I could n't guess at what rate . I was amazed to find I was barely clearing the trees , although the altimeter read close to 3000 feet above sea level . The terrain was rushing at me with relentless speed . After a long half hour , the rain eased a bit and the clouds rose . I relaxed a little . I was showing them that a rookie could get through . Just then , the engine stopped cold . As a rule , when an engine fails , it will give some warning . The water temperature will rise , or the oil pressure will drop , or there is a knocking or clanking . Even if it is only for a minute or two , it gives the pilot a chance to look around and head for a field or open place . However , when the timing gear in a Liberty engine failed , one second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next there was a tremendous silence . I quickly twisted all the knobs and gadgets in the cockpit , but there was no response , and the engine stayed dead . While my hands were trying to restart the engine , my neck was stretching and my eyes searching for some sort of field to land in . I was surrounded by heavily forested , sharplyrolling hills . To my left was a cuplike basin with a small clearing . It was downwind , but my gliding radius did n't allow much choice . I went for it . To reach the clearing required a sharp , almost vertical S turn , first left , then right , while killing just enough speed and altitude to land , downwind , and still miss a nearby cliff . I can even now feel the rain slanting into my face and see that open space rocking and swinging in front of me as I pulled out of the turn . One thing I could not know : the clearing was choked with brush and weeds , hiding a three-foot ledge of rock directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the undercarriage as I hit . The plane snapped like a popper on the end of a bull whip . I was catapulted into a long head-first dive , like a man shot from a circus cannon . Fortunately , I landed in the brush and rolled to a stop in a sitting position . The padded leather ring that rimmed the cockpit hung from my neck like a lei . I was still holding the rubber grip pulled loose from the control stick . My seat belt lay across my lap . I felt around to determine whether I had any broken bones . The wreckage of the plane was piled in a heap , like crumpled wastepaper . Except for this lone field , the place appeared to be a wilderness of trees . After some exploration , I located a little-used path and started to follow it . ? It meandered along for about half a mile and turned onto a dirt road . that I followed downhill for perhaps another mile before I came to a small cabin . Sitting on a bench before the cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in work clothes . They smiled and waved . My first impression was astonishment at how clean they were , their scrubbed faces glowing above the faded calico and denim . I told them about the accident and about my mail pouches , which would have to be taken to a railroad station . They assured me that the rural mail carrier would be along shortly with his horse and rig and would willingly help me . The couple were very solicitous . Almost apologetically the wife brought out a big bowl of tiny wild strawberries , a jug of clotted cream , and a loaf of fresh home-baked bread . Sure enough , the mail carrier came along in due course , with a sturdy mare pulling an old-fashioned hack . The old man and the mail carrier helped me bring the mail sacks down to the road and load them in the hack . Luckily , there were only three or four sacks , hardly a hundred pounds . Westbound air mail was expensive that day . After my thanks and good-bys , we drove about ten miles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stationmaster accepted the mail shipment . I used my Post Office travel commission to get a train ticket to Cleveland . It was quite a trip , my first flight with the mail . I was beginning to understand why the boys at the Flying Club had given me a farewell party . ON ARRIVAL in Cleveland from the forced landing at Pithole , I was surprised to hear little comment about my accident . Engine failure , forced landings , and crack-ups were so common on the Air Mail that , so long as the pilot was not killed or seriously hurt , no one gave them another thought . Teams of mechanics , ready for repair and salvage operations , were constantly busy . Even the airfields themselves were dangerous . Not counting Hazelhurst , which later became a part of Roosevelt Field , every mail field in early 1920 was so small and cramped that each take-off and landing was a test of skill . On my first trip to Chicago , I flew to where I had been told Checkerboard Field was located , next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sec nothing of it . I looked and circled for some time , finally returning to Ashburn and damaging my landing gear on a rut . When I telephoned in , they told me I had flown directly over Checkerboard . Actually , the field had been so dwarfed by the race track that I could not recognize it . Heller Field in Newark was probably the worst of all . Situated , as it was , between Tiffany 's factory and a canal , approaching planes had to glide between the factory building and a steep hill , make a sharp bank over a gully filled with debris , and quickly sit down , right out of the turn , to land even on the edge of the field . It was so small that a mound of earth had been bulldozed for the plane to run into . When a new pilot would come in for his first landing , the employees of Tiffany 's would line up on the ramp to observe ; they were usually rewarded with a spectacular splash in the canal , a wild ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glenn Martin field at Cleveland was small ; the only effective runway was hardly more than a cinder path , complicated by a decided bend . The Martin Bomber was used on the mail run between Cleveland and Chicago , a lumbering biplane with twin Liberty engines that presented the pilot with a test of skill whenever he took off with a load of mail . Time after time I saw the old tubs rock and bounce down the rutted runway , stagger into the air at the last second , miss the telephone wires by inches ? telephone wires around a field were almost universal ? and disappear in the distance , still so low that the pilot was rocking his wings to miss the chimneys of ordinary residences . Of the pilots then on the Chicago run , I remember W. J. Smith , P. T. Christensen , S. H. Stevens , and Warren " Bill " Williams . The first three were killed on the airway within the next two years . Only Bill Williams was able to carry on , always a consistent and able pilot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Air Transport , and its successor , United Air Lines . When he retired from active flying in 1954 at the compulsory age of sixty , he had amassed one of the most impressive totals of hours in the air ever known , probably challenged only by another man with much the same history , E. Hamilton Lee . Inside the Glenn L. Martin plant there was , besides the boss himself , a remarkable collection of aeronautical engineers , men of vision and ability , many of whom were to become leaders in our aviation industry . Among others , I remember meeting Larry Bell , who was to found the Bell Aircraft Company ; Rube Fleet , who founded the Fleet Aircraft Company , which , after absorbing Vultee , became Consolidated Aircraft ; and Donald Douglas , who now is chairman of the board of the great company that bears his name . It was fortunate that I started on the run between Cleveland and Bellefonte in the early summer . We had a period of weather that was relatively good for the Alleghenies . And my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since a pilot reached his maximum pay when he ran up six hundred hours of Post Office flying time , I would offer to fly other runs in addition to my own . This doubling up not only allowed me to gain experience but gave me pay raises sooner . On one occasion I flew to Cleveland in the morning and was able to pick up a trip back to Bellefonte that same afternoon . The newspapers called it an iron-man stunt ! MORE interesting than geography was weather . This was before the days of instrument flying , of radio beacons , and even of weather reports . If a pilot got caught in clouds or fog and lost sight of the horizon , it was not long before he fell because he was out of control . When the clouds were low , you had to fly close to the ground , close enough to see it ; the lower the clouds , the lower you flew , dodging steeples and jumping trees and telephone lines . Initially we had no en route weather reports . If it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through to the destination and inquire how it was there . The replies were limited to such whimsey as " Sunshine and flowers ; tell him to come ahead , " or , " Pea soup ; better cancel . " In doubtful weather there were some key spots to check along the route , usually in the mountains . After a time we tried calling up farmers who lived near these places and asking about the weather . It proved useless . If the weather was good , they could tell us ; but when it was not , their replies were vague . A typical interrogation might go : " Is it raining ? " " Yup . Pouring . " " How far can you see ? " " I can see as far as the next man . I do n't wear glasses or anything . " " What I want to know about is the clouds . How far up can you see now ? " " I do n't know , it 's pretty foggy ; about a mile , I guess . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Then the mountains should be all clear , are they ? " " How can I tell ? They 're all covered with clouds . " We gave up these haphazard inquiries and made a survey . Specific farmers were on call , each located near a mountainside . Specific objects or landmarks were selected at different elevations ; the farmer would report the farthest object he could see . This did prove useful ? that is , when we could reach the farmers . The next step was to employ local people at selected spots to wire us daily weather reports . It was about this time , too , that we started using the terms " ceiling " and " visibility " to describe aviation weather . I think it was probably in 1921 or 1922 that the Air Mail Service leased telegraph wires along the route , expanded the number of reporting stations , hired trained observers , installed radio stations at the main fields , and formed the nucleus that has expanded into the vast aviation weather service of today . In my earlier days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 50 per cent . There was hazard enough to suit the most avid adventurer . Not all the forced landings were in fields ; there were frequent crack-ups , some of them grim . The years 1920 and 1921 were the worst in the history of the Air Mail . In 1920 we had five fatal crashes , killing nine , a fatal crash for every 130,000 miles flown . In 1921 there were twelve fatal crashes , killing fifteen , with an average of 104,000 miles flown per crash . As a pilot could fly sixty or seventy thousand miles a year , his life expectancy would hardly make him welcome in an insurance office . I remember when Brooks Brothers refused to give me a charge account because my profession was too risky . By the end of 1921 the record began to improve . Men like Luther Harris and Richard Ingalls , mechanics in name but with the capacity of inventive engineers , devised scores of changes in the Liberty engine that vastly improved its reliability . Weather reporting was in force , and parachutescame into use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were able to pass some of this knowledge on to new pilots . Fatalities were reduced until , at the end of the Post Office operation in 1927 , the Air Mail had averaged but one fatal crash per half million miles during its history . As the total of my own interrupted flights piled up , I had become familiar with most of the fields suitable for emergency landing and had made friends in many of the towns along the route . I had knocked without warning on the doors of farmhouses scattered all the way from Boston to San Francisco . In those days , before radio , television , and universal rapid transportation , most farmers were friendly , hospitable , and eager to do anything they could to help . Brookville , in particular , was a favorite port of call for all the pilots on the Bellefonte-Cleveland run . If we were stopped by weather , we would turn back miles to be able to land there . We would circle the town before landing on the race track . By the time we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice Henderson would be there with her Cadillac , ready to take the mail pouches to the station and then devote herself to entertaining us during our stays . She loved us dearly , but her affection for mail pilots was uniquely platonic and uniquely respected . Across ' the street from Alice 's home was a brick wall enclosing a grassy park . On any fine day Alice would run out and stand on the wall to wave as we flew by . By flying down a street and ducking between a church and a bank , it was possible to make a low run at the little park . It was considered a feat if we could dive close enough to make her jump off the wall . THE one time I was in a bad enough fix to want to jump was in the days when we were still flying without parachutes . I believe that each surviving Air Mail pilot will tell you that at least once , early in his mail career , he had a brush with death that put the fear of God in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest error in judgment or a few seconds of carelessness might put his life in forfeit . Once a man got past that point safely , his chance of becoming a true professional pilot was much enhanced . I know that my ordeal marked a change in the quality of my work ; I became not so much a more cautious pilot , for timidity has its dangers too , but a more thoughtful , careful one . I was flying east out of Omaha in rainy , dirty weather , trying to make my way through the rolling country beyond Council Bluffs . The clouds were scraping the tops of the low hills . By ducking down into the hollows between the hills it was possible to see a little ahead , but when I pulled in over the higher rolls the fog would thicken and the ground dim , even with my wheels almost brushing the grass . I knew that in just a few miles I would reach a draw with a railroad in it that was two or three hundred feet lower than the terrain I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I should have . As I went over one of the low hills the ground faded completely from sight , but I quickly eased the plane down and made it into the next hollow , where I was able to see a little . The hill ahead came at me fast , and instead of turning , I was teased into climbing its slope . Again the ground faded from sight , but this time for more than a few seconds . When I eased back down , feeling for the next little valley , I did not sec the surface until I banged into it . The wheels evidently hit on a smooth grass field , for the plane , instead of crashing , bounced . Instinctively I pulled back on the stick , the plane shot up into the fog , and when it leveled off at several hundred feet I was completely in the soup . While I still had a sense of orientation I tried to make a blind turn , and then leveled off again in what I hoped was the direction back . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swing ; it takes some time before it can give a course indication . I now had no choice but to attempt to fly blind , locking the rudder in neutral , holding the stick in my fingertips , feeling the wind on my cheeks , and watching the air-speed indicator . In this manner I was able to get the plane under some control and ease it down little by little , until my altimeter read that I was as low as I had been before . But I was unable to see anything of the ground , and the fog pouring back through my wings remained as thick and opaque as wet cotton . I dared not let down any lower or I would be bound to fly into the side of a hill , so I started to climb , mostly in desperation , for there was only a forlorn chance I could ever get on lop of this type of weather . Now there followed a long period of fighting to keep control of the plane , while all the time my equilibrium became steadily more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the plane began to get more and more out of control . It lost altitude until I was back down to 5000 feet . By this time I felt I had been milling around in the clouds for an eternity and found myself wondering why I did not run out of fuel . At last I fell . The plane stalled and whipped off into a spin , although to my bewildered senses it did not seem to be spinning down but , , impossibly , up and to the side . I cut the throttle and held the plane in the spin for a few seconds to be certain I was in a known con- dition and to force my mind to reorient . When I broke the spin , I could n't pull out level from the resulting dive . The plane floundered through the dark muck in a series of stalls , spins , dives , and pull-outs . I struggled and fought with it all the way down , working with desperate concentration , but that little corner of my mind that detachedly views such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duck . " The altimeter needle was dropping fast , and I knew I was low as I tried to recover from the fifth or sixth stall and spin . If I 'd been in a Jenny , I would have let it spin in , but a crash in a full spin in a DH-4 was almost always fatal , to I continued trying to right the plane . The wires were screaming from what seemed a full dive , and I was pulling back hard to get the nose up when the tops of trees came flashing by , just below my wings . I was almost level . I rammed the stick forward to hold the plane there , cut both ignition switches , and coasted ahead , expecting to hit , but not knowing what . The plane slid out from under the deck of cloud to show me I was only fifty feet high ? and over cleared land . I rolled to a stop , the propeller dead . After some minutes I began to tremble . I climbed out of the plane and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be 1924 , night air mail had become an established fact . We even paraphrased the Post Office Department ( and Herodotus ) to read , " Neither rain nor sleet nor hail nor gloom of night can stay this courier from his onward flight , " and adopted it as our own slogan . We found that at night , much as in the day , when we had fair horizontal visibility we could fly under quite low ceilings , down to a couple of hundred feet . Rain did not bother us , short of a heavy downpour ; the flashing beacons seemed to glisten even more brightly in the wet . Thunderstorms , however impressive at night and terrifying from an open cockpit , were generally not so serious as they seemed . It was necessary , however , to be prepared to turn back quickly , for it was possible to blunder into a solid wall of rain or find ourselves suddenly blind in a low-lying bank of clouds in turbulence that taxed our strength . For me , despite this knowledge gained over the years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thunderstorm I had to muster all my nerve anew . Clear black nights were the best to fly ; even more lovely , I thought , than when a full moon filled space with a milky radiance . On such a night the sky was ablaze with stars , the towns and villages a sprawl of jewels , and the revolving beacons sharp sparks in a row far ahead . Urea- sional meteors would strike across the sky , and sometimes flared so bright the pilot had to blink and duck his head against the sudden light . On one trip , when I had flown out of such a night into the flame of an autumn dawn , as I neared Chicago the quilted floor of fields and roads was marred by increasing patches of white fog , lying innocently here and there in shallow pools . There was enough visible ground for me to find my way until I was within a mile of the field , but then all was covered and the fog stretched solid to the east . The fog was fairly shallow , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , from the tall smokestack that sat just west of the flying field . Circling over , I could just make out the stack 's tip . Using it as a marker , I could line up with the runway , but when I glided down I could not even see the tips of my wings , and I had to push open the throttle and pull back on top . Circling , I saw that my propeller wash had made a gouge in the top of the fog as the plane dipped in , like a scoop taking ice cream from the top of a can . This gave me an idea : perhaps I could dig out enough fog to see the end of the runway . It took a long time . I would dip in , then hold the plane 's nose up in a near stall and jazz the engine to send the wash churning behind at a downward angle . After nearly an hour of circling and dipping I had dug out a ragged trough about three hundred feet deep and could just see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down took care , for I had to start the glide beyond the edge of the hole , be blind for a moment , then have a few seconds to set the plane on the runway before I was blind in the fog again . A DH does not roll far on landing ; the Maywood runway was broad and long ; and the landing came off just fine . But the fog was so dense I could not see to taxi ; men had to come out and guide me to the hangar . To those on the ground , my many circles and dips had sounded as though I were lost in the fog and desperately trying to dive into the field , although no one could understand how I could keep flying in the horrible muck . Dick Ingalls almost worked himself into a heart attack repeatedly climbing the beacon tower to point its beam in hopes it would help me land ; then , when he heard the throttle open and the plane start coming his way , frantically scrambling down in fear it would hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night it was well-nigh impassable . It caused the death of several pilots caught out on a run by sudden change . Winter was a time of many canceled flights until we learned to fly on instruments . Deep snow on our field was also a great problem in winter flying ; for , although we tried putting skis on our landing gear , conditions might rule themout at the other end of a flight . So we did our best with wheels . We became adept at preventing nose-overs in landing : to take off in a foot or more of snow we 'd blow down the tail with our propeller blast and bounce the plane . One day at Omaha I watched Jack Knight plow his plane up and down the field for five hours , then refuel and go at it for another hour , by which time he had beaten a track that allowed him to take off . Popes often asked me why I liked being a pilot , why I flew the mail and took such chances of getting killed . I would try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain it all . I knew that I could fly , and fly well , and this skill set me apart from the run of the mill . I certainly had no wish to get killed , but I was not afraid of it . I would have been frightened if I had thought I would get maimed or crippled for life , but there was little chance of that . A mail pilot was usually killed outright . Then , too , sometimes I was called a hero , and I liked that . One of the most rewarding things about a mail pilot 's job was the combination of high pay and leisure time . As a normal thing we worked two or three days a week , five or six hours a day , - plus standing reserve perhaps one day a week , which only meant keeping the field advised as to how we might be reached . I spent my time as unproductively as possible : learning to play golf , chasing girls , reading indiscriminately , and ? an interest that has remained with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never tell of was the beauty and exaltation of flying itself . Above the haze layer , with the sun behind you or sinking ahead , alone in an open cockpit , there is nothing and everything to see . The upper surface of the haze stretches on like a vast and endless desert , featureless and flat and empty to the horizon . It seems your world alone . As you thread your way through the great piles of summer cumulus that hang over the plains , you realize that the patches of ground far below are for earthbound folk and the cloud shapes are sculptured just for you . The flash of rain , the shining rainbow riding completely around the plane , the lift over mountain ridges and crawling trains , the steady , pure air at dawn take-offs , and the smoke from the newly lit fires in houses just coming to life below ? these are some of the many bits that help pay for the tense moments of plunging through fog , or the somber thoughts when flying cortege for a pilot 's funeral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other conceivable choice seemed dull , prosaic , and humdrum . But there were occasions , many occasions , when a pilot had to work . Once , when I was forced down by rain and fog , I landed in a field of mud so deep that my wheels sank to the hub . During the night a cold frost passed through , the temperature dropped to near zero , and a stiff winter wind chilled our bones . The plane was half a mile from the nearest house . First I had to borrow picks and crowbars ; then , assisted by a teen-age boy , I had to slug the hard mud for hours before the plane was free , after which we fetched a great iron kettle , hauled it and mounted it over an open fire , filled it with buckets of water , which we brought to a boil . At the same time , oil was heating in cans pushed close to the fire . Standing on boxes , we had to fill the radiator and engine jackets with hot water and the tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start , the water and oil had to be drained again before they froze tight ; had to be reheated once more and repoured . Twice we went through this cycle . The third time , while the water and oil were heating I walked to the village two miles away , bought a can of ether , and primed the balky engine . All in a night 's work . At the other extreme , there was too little physical exertion . Riding alone in a mail DH , one might pass the time in a way no present-day pilot can conceive of , surrounded as he is by dials and threading his way through the dense traffic . Back then , on a good-weather flight , particularly at night , there was little to do as the ship droned along . To amuse myself , I would take along a magazine , and with the ship trimmed and on course , would turn the cockpit lights bright and read , tearing off a page when finished and looking up to check my course as I let it fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of night flying , we were completely alone on a run ; unless we were scheduled to pass the opposite flight , which was rare , we never saw another plane . There was none in the air . One dark night , with perfectly smooth air , I was coasting along at about 5000 feet , reading my magazine . At the end of a page I looked up . Dead ahead and coming directly at me , there suddenly loomed a shape in space , lit like a misplaced constellation . Instantly I yanked on the stick and threw the plane hard over into a terrified turn . Once headed away , I looked back . It was even larger than I had thought . Inevitably curious , I turned again and passed close by its side . It was one of the great dirigibles , puffed up with its own immensity , sailing blithely down my right of way . As I learned later , it was the Shenandoah ; she was to find her tragedy without my help . In 1925 the Post Office Department began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail over feeder lines , lines branching off from the transcontinental route operated directly by the Air Mail Service . The Kelly Act , permitting further expansion of this practice , paved the way for the leasing of the transcontinental route itself . In 1927 the route was leased , but only after much political activity by various bidders , including an attempt by the Air Mail pilots themselves to bid on the route between Hadley and Chicago . Boeing Air Transport was awarded the contract between Chicago and San Francisco , and National Air Transport beat out the pilots for the Eastern half . It was these companies that merged some years later and , after acquisition of still other carriers , became what is now known as United Air Lines . The new companies purchased the aircraft and operating equipment used by the Air Mail Service , and the pilots and other personnel were transferred to their payroll . By the end of September , 1927 , the pilots of the runs between Chicago and the East Coast found themselves employees of National Air Transport . The Post Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the vital role of the Post Office Department Air Mail Service in aviation 's history seems virtually forgotten , yet its gallant efforts gave genesis to our present vast system of civil air transportation . The Service was in existence for less than a decade and was never in any sense large . When I joined the Air Mail in 1920 there were a dozen or so pilots employed by the Post Office Department . There were forty-three pilots when the Service ended in 1927 . During its brief history , forty-three had been killed and twenty-three more had been seriously injured . On February 14 , 1931 , the 71st Congress passed Public Law 661 , from which I quote : " The President is hereby authorized . . . to present .. . an air-mail flyer 's medal of honor . . . to any person who , while serving in the air-mail service since May 15 , 1918 , has distinguished himself by heroism or extraordinary achievement in such service . " Subsequent to the passage of this act , the medal was awarded to several airline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least desire to detract from the merit of these awards , I consider it an ironic fact that the medal has never been awarded to a single employee of the Post Office Air Mail Service . Surely among the survivors or the dead there are some who belong on such a roll of honor . In my book , they all do .
