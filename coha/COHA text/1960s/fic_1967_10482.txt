" So we 're all here to praise and bury Caesar , " Ira remarked . " I hope no one seriously thinks they 're going to revive the corpse , " Ira 's friend said . Then Ira reminded himself , and he said , " Frank , I 'd like you to meet a friend of mine . Jonas Gould . Jonas , this is Frank Mulloy . Frank is an actor , director , teacher , and playwright . What else are you , Frank ? " " Unemployed . . . . Hello , Jonas . " Too late Jonas realized that Frank Mulloy would just as soon have dispensed with the formality of a handshake . But Jonas already had his hand stuck out , and Frank suffered his own to be taken . NaturallyJonas despised this cool , sophisticated man , but he could n't help being fascinated with his face . He could n't recall meeting anyonewith a face quite as flawless . On the John Barrymore style , only without the flaring nostrils and fake ferocity . " Who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about everybody , " Frank answered . " I caught a glimpse of Adele and Tod a while ago . Alex and Ruth are somewhere in the center there . " The speaker who had been addressing the crowd finished his remarks and introduced someone new , a name that meant nothing to Jonas . But evidently it meant something to Ira and Frank and most of the other people . There was much applause . Jonas joined in , feeling foolish about it . Then he stood with his arms folded across his chest , for all the world a veteran protest marcher , one who knew what personal and cultural tragedies were involved in the death of the Federal Theatre Project . Actually , his attention was divided between the marquees of the movie houses up the street ( Sacha Guitry in The Cheat ; Charles Laughton in The Beachcomber ; and one farther down he could n't make out ) and Frank Mulloy 's cigarettesmoking . That was really something , Frank and his cigarette . Brought the thing to his mouth as if they were having a love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long draught ( a kind of sleepy ecstasy ) , and then the terrific traffic of smoke that followed ! Billows from his slightly parted lips , sucked up again into his nostrils , emitted once again from between his lips , from his nostrils , in jets , in ribbons , in arabesques !  | " Here comes Alex , " said Frank . " And Ruth . " Jonas looked in the direction indicated and saw two people attempting to writhe out of the crowd . Ira touched him on the arm , and he followed along . There was another exchange of greetings , and then more people joined them , and they all decided to go to the usual place for coffee . They walked in a body along Broadway and entered a cafeteria on the next corner . They drew two tables togetherand then went for trays , bringing back coffee and pieces of Danish pastry as big as a fielder 's glove . There were two girls present , and they were both attractive in different ways . Ruth had dark hair . Adele was fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was called Alex . Jonas sat between Ira and Ruth . And what the hell was Jonas Gould doing here anyway ? Ira Hirsch had his goddam nerve throwing him into something like this ! I mean , Jesus , you ask a guy first ! Alex , the older man , seemed to command respect when he spoke . He was wearing a short-sleeved summer shirt , checkered , and when he sat down at the table he withdrew from various pockets a curved pipe , a pouch of tobacco , matches . He shoveled tobacco into the bowl with his index finger and held a match to the untidy little heap . Flaming crumbs fell to the table , on his lap . Alex brushed them away unconcernedly . " But think , " he said , " was n't it inevit-able ? " " Why inevitable ? " demanded Tod , the hefty , handsome young man Jonas linked with the girl they called Adele . " Because , " Alex explained , with the air of a man who was happy to undertake explanations , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to please everybody , you pleased nobody . The F.T.P. should have been made into a true proletarian theatre while there was still the chance . " " With government money ? " Frank Mulloy asked . " Strictly speaking , " Alex retorted with a little smile , " it 's governmentmoney that finances all change , including revolution . " " Shame on you , Alex , " said Frank languidly . " That 's sophistry . " " But seriously , " Alex insisted , " if Federal Theatre had the people'ssupport , the politicians would n't have dared kill it . " " And how do you get the people 's support ? " Frank asked . " Thep52Revolt of the Beavers was capitalist propaganda , I suppose ? The Living Newspaper was bourgeois tripe ? Come off it , Alex . There 's no people 's party sitting in Washington . It 's still the capitalists who vote the money . " " Need I remind you that it was precisely the capitalists who did n't vote the money , " Alex said . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About who killed Cock Robin , " Ira said . But the conversation went on in that vein , and although Jonas tried to pay strict heed to what was being said , he found himself wandering off , or being shunted off by references that were meaninglessto him . . . " The Guild  --  , " " The Group  --  , " " The League  --  , " ... Nobody paid any attention to him , but nobody seemed to mind that he was there . Maybe this was the way it was with sophisticatedpeople ; they brought you along , and then let you sink or swim . He wondered what would happen if he just got up and walked away ; simply walked right out of the cafeteria . Would he be missed ? Would anyone comment on his absence ? Would even Ira notice ? Oddly , though , the longer he sat there , the more conspicuous he felt . If he were to get up now , his presence would loom over them with embarrassing obtrusiveness . They would look at him , wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Better to sit absolutely quiet , listening , head down , pressing the ball of one finger against a slice of almond and bringing it to his teeth . Nibbling . Let 's say he was deeply affected by the death of the Federal Theatre Project ; a friend of the family , so to speak , wishing to pay his respects on the death of the dearly beloved ... . Now ! That girl ! The one sitting diagonally opposite , the one called Adele ! He had seen her face before ! Her name was Adele Rivers ! . . . Jonas experienced an explosion of recall that scalded the inside of his skull . He could see the theatre section of the newspaperand the photograph , fullface , and he remembered the review which stated that Adele Rivers was one of the more notable performersin a group of youngsters who burst upon the stage with a something of spirit sorely needed in these something times . There ! That girl ! She with the ice-blue eyes and unhappy mouth ! . . . Jonas felt a nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was sitting among those mythical creatures , nymphs and satyrs , the ones who actually appeared on stage . Actressesand actors ! Ira Hirsch talking about it was one thing , but that girl over there was really and truly an actress ! As if his inner excitement had generated something palpable , at that moment the girl sitting next to him turned and asked , " Are you interested in theatre ? " " Oh , no , " he disavowed all too hastily . " Not at all . I just happen to know Ira . We live in the same neighborhood . I play handball and he watches . " Jesus H. Christ ! Brilliant ! " Are you a good handball player ? " she asked . " I win more than I lose , " he said . This girl was the one they called Ruth . She was paired with Alex , he of the curved pipe and the good-natured authority . ( Were they married ? ) Ruth 's eyes were black and her lashes were thickly matted with make-up . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was long and of an even darker hue than her eyes . Like coal . " What do you do , Jonas ? " she asked . Strange , that she should remember his name . During the introductionson the street a little while ago , his name had been wafted around with one-finger pokes , like a balloon . He would have sworn that not one of them remembered it . " Well , I do n't do anything , really , " he replied . " I mean I work . A job . I 'm not anybody special . " Ruth received this information with a level , unaltered gaze . Then she turned away from Jonas and asked Alex if they would be leaving soon . She was exhausted . . . . That meant they were married . Did n't it ? Of course . What other connection could they have ? Alex certainly was n't her father . Out in the street once again there was a repetition of the cat 's cradle of hands and names , and when the melee was untangled Tod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " where ?  --  home ?  --  somewhere , together . And were they married ? Or did they live in unholy unwedlock , as might very well be the delightful case with nymphs and satyrs ... ? The rest proceeded north on Broadway , the shapeless plan beingp54that they would all walk to " Alex and Ruth 's place , " wherever that was . Alex and Ira were deep in talk , and Ruth was on the other side of Alex . To spare Frank Mulloy the awkwardness of making up a second file with only Jonas Gould for company , Jonas kept abreast of the others for almost a block . But five in a row was ridiculous on Broadway , so Jonas stopped at a fire hydrant to tie a shoelace . Ruth glanced behind to see what had become of him , and as he came up to them again she fell behind to keep him company . She asked him what he meant by saying he was n't anybody special . That was a silly thing to say . Was he in the habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the habit . Aside from what it must do to his own ego , it made other people feel very uncomfortable . Did he realize that ? . . . Ruth was wearing a white blouse with a large bow of the same material at the waist . And a black skirt . In the cafeteria , Jonas had received the impression of slenderness , but walking beside her now and catching glimpses of her body in motion , he began to make out her true proportions . She had , to begin with , and Jonas usually began there , full round breasts . Her hips shared that amplitude . In fact , she was the opposite of slender . Perhaps it was her face that had thrown him off . The lines of her face gave no clue to the abundance below . A delicate concavity defined its shape from cheek bone to jaw . Her lips were full , but not overripe . Probably what Debbie would call " fine features . " Debbie . had once said that Katharine Hepburn had " fine features . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , you asked me what I did , " Jonas said . " Do you want to hear about my job ? I work in a print shop . That 's not very interesting , is it ? " " Who says you have to be doing anything interesting ? " she said . " And why should n't working in a print shop be interesting ? " " Okay , " said Jonas . He felt he had been lectured enough . Heasked , " Alex is your husband , is n't he ? " " Yes . " " What 's his full name ? " " Alex Klein . " " Then you 're Mrs. Klein . Mrs. Ruth Klein. "  | " That 's right , " she said , glancing at him with a faint smile . " Were you in the same show with Adele Rivers ? " " Yes . " " Is that the name you used  --  Ruth Klein ? " " No . Ruth Miller . Miller is my maiden name . " Jonas nodded . " And Tod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , too , " Ruth said . " I mean his full name , " Jonas said . " I 'm afraid I did n't get it when we were introduced . " " Tod Taylor , " said Ruth . " That 's a nice name . " " It 's a stage name . " " Not his real one ? " " No . " " What 's his real name ? " " Arthur Schneider . " Jonas was too late to control one of his more disgraceful giggles . It spilled from him , high and sappy . It was n't exactly news to him that stage people changed their names , but the backward leap from Tod Taylor to Arthur Schneider had the crazy-comic aspect of a reel in reverse  --  the diver flying feetfirst back to the diving board . " What 's so funny ? " Ruth asked . " It 's not funny , " Jonas apologized . " I 'm sorry . Do n't mind me . I have a lot of bad habits . I 'm curious , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Well , it 's not so strange , " Ruth said . " His name is Schneider . " " So ? " Ruth looked at him . " Do n't you know what Schneider means ? " she asked . " In Yiddish ? " Jonas shook his head . That was one of the dark places in the Gould mansion of well-lighted rooms . He did n't know Yiddish , not really , just a handful of words , and this despite the fact that his Hartford Aunt Selma and Uncle Nat had conversed almost exclusivelyin Yiddish . As he later realized , he had n't listened to his aunt and uncle ; he had listened to his father and sister . " Not that it makes the slightest difference , " Ruth said , " but just asp56a matter of curiosity , are n't you Jewish ? I assume you are because of the name . " " I am , " Jonas said . " We just did n't speak it at home . What does Schneider mean ? " " It means tailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tod ? " " I do n't know about the Tod . " " Why do actors and actresses change their names ? " Jonas asked her . " They do n't all change their names . . . . Are you being serious ? Do n't you know why ? " " Because Jewish names are funny ? " Ruth Klein looked at him doubtfully . Was he being stupid ? Jonas smiled , knowing he could n't completely remove the suspicion of obtuseness , but playing a little on what he hoped would be taken as boyishness . Ruth explained about names , stating first that Jewish names were n't the least bit funny , and that it was n't only Jews who changed their names on the stage . She explained to him that Americanaudiences liked to identify . A name that was very specifically Jewish , or Italian , or anything , got in the way of that identification . Scarcely anybody in Hollywood used his real name . And not only in Hollywood . People in public life . Look at Lenin . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for that matter . Everybody has a secret self , but most people do n't bother to give their secret self a name . Often they do when that secret self becomes a public personality , or when they hope it will  --  as in the case of actors , or demigods , or demidemons . . . . Did he see ? He saw . And now they fell silent . Jonas walked beside Mrs. Ruth MillerKleinnot knowing what to say . Should he say , " Look , Susannah of the Mounties with Shirley Temple is playing at the Roxy ? " Should he ask her how it was that she , Ruth , was married to that round gentleman up front ? That was n't , of course , a question to ask , but if he were to ask it he would want to make it known instantaneously , in a single word , that he was asking not because he found the union odd or disagreeable , but because he found the complications of lifep57fascinating . For the sake of his general enlightenment , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had brought dark-haired , dark-eyed Ruth Miller to the bed of pudgy , pipey Alex Klein . But there was no need to say anything . They had turned into one of the side streets in the upper Forties , and it was in one of those nondescript , flat-faced , three-story brownstones just east of Sixth Avenue that the Kleins lived .... And so good night ... . Good night , Ruth .... Good night , Alex .... Good night , Frank Mulloy . . .. You ought to have that system of manifolds patented , Frank . You 'd make a fortune .... Amazingly , it was that same Frank Mulloy who had taken notice of one of the minor absurditiesof the evening . He said to Jonas , " You did n't get a chance to say much , did you ? That 's the penalty of associating with theatre people . Beware , Jonas . " And shook Jonas 's hand . Riding homeward , Ira looked utterly sunk . He sat hunched on the window side of the subway seat , his hands clasped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the car they were in was empty save for one old man asleep on a cushion of chins . The car itself gave out its seasonal mixture of dirt and steel mixed with summer air from which all the green and gold had been filtered . Ira allowed that this might not have been the most entertaining evening of Jonas 's life . For which he was sorry . He had n't anticipated meetingall those others ... . And that , Jonas thought , was one goddam lie . Ira had expected to meet his friends . Ira had hoped to meet his friends . And what is more , he had n't given a thought to whether Jonas Gould was entertainedor not once he had met them . " What 's the matter with you ? " Jonas asked him . " I 'm scared , " Ira said . " Of what ? " " Everything . I feel death licking me with its stinking tongue . I 'm such an unattractive bastard . Why should it want me ? " " Why death ? " Jonas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a million years old , " Ira said , " and I have one more day to live . " " When you 're doing what you want to be doing , you 'll have a millionyears to live , " Jonas told him . Ira nodded.  |p59Jonas  let himself into the apartment and stood for a moment listening for signs of wakefulness . None . He reached around the door jamb of the kitchen and switched on the light . The whiteness and order of the kitchen pleased him , bespeaking presences : Solomon 's , in the way the dish towels were draped and separated on the three-prong rack ; Debbie 's , in the chorus line of cups hung from pegs under the cupboard . Jonas went to the cupboard and took from it the box of Mallomars , from which he ate three , one after the other , lining the cavity of his mouth with a chocolate paste . Then he opened the refrigerator and helped himself to a half-full bottle of milk . Ice cold . God ! Good ! Something quick moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time to see a mouse whisk behind the stove . He had n't seen one of those for a long time . Have to do something about that . Set a trap . Debbie had fits at the thought of mice . Set a trap , and then be in the kitchen first for the next few days , for if there was anything worse than a live mouse it was a dead one , especially one with its head mashed . Still holding the empty bottle of milk in one hand and the cookie box in the other , Jonas sat down at the kitchen table . The window was open from the bottom , and a soft breeze carrying something deliciously sweet  --  honeysuckle or lilac  --  wafted in . Jonas closed his eyes and breathed in the fragrance . It washed down tracing a beautifulviolet line along his heart , stirring memory . But Jonas was too preoccupied with immediate thoughts . Debbie . Things were not as they should be with Debbie . Their recent conflicts over Norman had unsettled an immemorial order , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , her shoulders set in that rejectingline . The currency with which he had always purchased his priorities of love and attention had lost some of its value . These were not new thoughts . Fragments had passed through his mind before , but now they cohered , assumed a shape , and that shape was not unlike the one that had formed earlier in the evening , when he had walked with Ira Hirsh . The end of a wholeness . The beginnings of change . . . . Funny . Norman B. Prager and Ira Hirsch and Adolf Hitler , harbingers all , winging in from some roiled and unseeable future . Jonas felt a premonitory chill . He listened more closely to the involuted silence of the apartment . It made a roaring in his ears , like a conch ... . Jonas heard a sound that did not belong to the roar of silence . Twang of bedspring . A movement within . Again . Then a familiar shuffle through the rooms , and Solomon appearing at the kitchen door , pajamas bagging , eyes narrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did I wake you ? " Jonas asked . " I was up , " Solomon said , glancing at the kitchen clock . " So late ? " " It 's not so late , " Jonas said . " Anything the matter ? " " No , nothing is the matter , " Solomon returned in his rumbling voice . He came into the kitchen and sat down , looking at the milk bottle and cookie box . " Where were you ? " he asked . " Downtown . I told you . With a friend . There was a demonstration on Broadway , about the Federal Theatre Project .... " " What have you got to do with that ? " Solomon inquired , a note of surprise in his voice . " Nothing , " Jonas replied . " My friend has . It 's a good cause , is n't it ? " " First you go , then you ask . " " Gave employment to over four thousand people in New York alone . " " Are you thinking of going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before , but  --  uh  --  what do you think ? Should I ? " Solomon nodded solemnly . His arm rested on the table . His hand ,  |p61as  dark and scarified as wharf planking , brushed across the enamel surface , making a whispering sound . He began to tap with two fingers . " How is the job going ? " he asked . Jonas smiled . " Did you stay awake to ask me that ? " he asked . " It just occurred to me , " said his father . " Well , the job is going great , " Jonas assured him . " At least I have n't given notice yet . " " It would n't be such a bad idea if you did , " Solomon said . " Do you ever think about going back to school ? " " Breathe in deep , Pa . . . . Do you smell that ? " Solomon nodded . Jonas said , " I have n't thought about going back to school lately . " " I read in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not a bad trade . There 's a future in avia-tion . " Jonas dropped his eyes . " What 's the matter with the printing trade ? " he asked . " As trades go , that 's supposed to be pretty good . Even Norman says so . . . . Has Debbie been talking to you ? " Solomon turned toward the window , his face unrevealing . He said : " You could go at night . Evening courses . " " Uh-huh . Any news on the radio tonight ? " " Nothing special . " " Pa , supposing there 's a war ? Who would we be fighting ? Hitler ? You talk about a future . What kind of a future ? " " There wo n't be a war , " Solomon said . " Hitler wo n't fight . Englandand France will stop him . " " Fine . Then why worry ? " " It 's an old habit . . . . All right , go to bed . " " How about a cup of tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , water wo n't boil at one-thirty in the morning ? " " No , thanks , " Solomon said . " No tea . So tell me what you think . " " About what ? " " About the future . " Solomon was not one to ask about the future . He predicted it . For years he had been predicting it . Each move Hitler made was to be his last . In Austria . In Czechoslovakia . England would threaten withp62her navy . France would mobilize . Russia would move troops to the border . The German people would become frightened . There would be a convulsion inside Germany , and Hitler would be cut away like a disease . That these things had not come to pass did not make the predictions wrong ; only delayed them . The end of Hitler and Mussolini would surely come , reasonable people would take over , and Europe , having tossed and moaned like a man in a nightmare , would awaken . The great period of light and liberty would begin . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have gotten a little darker . Solomon wanted assurance that he was right . Jonas , knowing his father was wrong , saw no contradiction in preservingthe rightness . It was like Solomon 's chess games with Kramer . Kramer won , but Solomon believed himself to be the better player because he played on the grand level of the masters  --  although without the masters ' brilliance . Kramer won by sneaky little tricks , by unworthy cunning . Therefore his winning was not victory , but the short-term tribute guile exacts from principle . So with Hitler . By defying principles of justice , goodness , nobility , Hitler was building up a charge of lightning that would strike him , if not dead ( Solomon did not believe in miracles ) , then insane , distraught . It would harry that beast through the world , like the picture Jonas had once seen in an illustrated Bible , the picture of Cain , bent and fearful , trying to flee the vengeance of God . Only Solomon did n't believe in God , therefore the faith that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved in their God : faith in the teeth of every contrary evidence ; faith hammered deeper with every misfortune ; faith maintained even while the faithful carried on a terrifying dialogue with reason . " The future , " Jonas said , squinting at some indeterminate distance . " It 's going to be a hot summer . " Solomon sighed and nodded . " A sage , " he said . " You know what we ought to do ? " Jonas suddenly broke out . " I 'm serious , Pa . We ought to buy a car . A used car , in good condition , not a jalopy . The three of us are working . We 've got some money saved up . Just think . We could take trips to the beach , to the World 's Fair , anywhere .... " " This is the future ? " Solomon asked  | " It would n't be such a bad future if we could get to the beach without half-dying on the way , " Jonas declared . " If you want to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , " Solomon suggested . Jonas grimaced . " What for ? To take that sweaty ride out there every evening ? " " Debbie gets a vacation , " Solomon reminded him . " She 's better off going to a resort where somebody else will make the meals . " " Maybe this year she wo n't be going to a resort , " Solomon said . Jonas glanced quickly at his father . He felt the coldness of the milk in his stomach . " Why ? " he asked . " Did she say anything ? " " She did n't say anything , " Solomon replied . " Everything does n't have to be said . " " You do n't mean Norman ? " Jonas asked . Solomon looked at his own hands on the table . " Pa , would you want Debbie to marry Norman ? " Jonas asked . Solomon made a growling noise . He said , " Would I want ? Why , Debbie will marry somebody I want ? Do I spend my time seeking a husband for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anyone , to tell Debbie who to marry ? " " I do n't mean that , " Jonas said . " Of course nobody has the right . But I mean you , how do you feel about it ? " Solomon said , " If I were a woman , Norman would n't cause me sleepless nights . " There ! Vindicated ! Solomon did n't like Norman either ! " Then how can Debbie go out with the guy ? You do n't like  --  him  --  " " Did I say that ? " Solomon interrupted . " And please talk very quietly . I said Norman does n't thrill me . I 'm not Debbie . " " What can she see in him ? " Jonas demanded , his voice a nearsqueakin its pained perplexity . " Debbie is pretty . She wears nice clothes . I think of the way she irons the pleats in those skirts  --  Christ , there must be a thousand of them !  --  and do you mean to say ' that she 's ironed all those pleats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleat from a  --  a fountain pen ! That 's what kills me ! When I think of Debbie 's pleats and perfumes and the way she setsp64her hair  --  and all of this for the benefit of fish-eyed Norman who takes her to museums . " While Jonas fumed , Solomon raised his hand and like an orchestra leader waved his son down and down , until Jonas 's voice was a moist , furious sibilance at the end . Solomon 's eyes remained on Jonas when he had finished . A curious look , neither corroborative nor reproachful ; patient , rather , as one might listen to a child 's versionof some truth long known . Jonas turned impatiently away from that look , catching at , dismissing , whatever implications might be there . He was not jealous , or possessive , or whatever the hell his father was trying to suggest . He wanted Debbie to get married  --  but to someone worthy of her ! " You want some advice ? " Solomon said . " Keep my mouth shut , " Jonas said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the better the chances Debbie will marry him . " Jonas shrugged . " So let her marry him , " he said . " It 's her life . I do n't care . " " And what if I should say that Debbie loves this man , " Solomon said . " That she 'll be happy with him . Is that important , too ? Who she 'll be happy with ? " " Sure , sure . " " Anyway , " said Solomon , " that 's why I would n't want to buy a car now . " " Why ? " " It 's customary for a family to give a daughter something . " Jonas got up and returned the box of Mallomars to the cupboard . Then he rinsed the milk bottle and placed it under the sink . He turned around and faced his father again . " Tell me one thing , " he said , " did Debbie say anything to you tonight ? Did she say she and Norman were going to get married ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way ? " " Because when I talk to Debbie , I 'm talking to only half a Debbie . The other half is somewhere else . " Jonas nodded concurrence.  |p65To  bring on sleep , Jonas played handball . He flipped the ball with a backward spin , and caught it in a smooth power drive , whipping it close to the rear foul line , catching them flat-footed . . . . Mmhmn ! . . . Another . And another . Hooking one to the left , one to the right . . . nineteen  --  twenty -- twenty-one . . . Thank you , please . Next . . . A return , high and looping , scooping it hip-high and wide , plenty of leverage , powdering the ball against the wall ... Oh , fast ! Like a bullet ! Could n't touch it . . .

The ball shot back low and parallel to the ground , touching down and breaking sharp at the foul line . A player on the other team waved at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Jonas . " Pow-wah ! " he crowed . Their opponents shook their heads and smiled distantly . Midway through the game , they had become detached , spectators to their own defeat . Older men pretend amusement in a game where they have ceased to be competitive . Every Gould tappet was clicking away joyously in a well of oil . A hot , unhindered sun supplied high combustion to the Gould machine . Jonas loved the sun when he played . It could n't burn fiercely enough . It baked energy into his shoulders . His body became as slick as a seal 's . He rubbed the inside of his leather gloves against the sweat , a wet little secret which added more vicious break to his hook . Jonas and Dan had won five in a row . Their opponents in the second game were the twins , one of whom still wore iridescent shades of green and lavender around his eyes , the colors of a pigeon 's neck . Before the game , he had come up to Jonas and held out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the hand , and then almost split the ball in two with the fury of his serves . During the sixth game , Ira Hirsch 's head appeared above the parapet . " Two more games , " Jonas told him . Ira dipped his head.  |p67It  was after three o'clock when they walked away from the courts , Jonas almost fifteen dollars richer . " I saw our friends the twins playing on the other court , " Ira said . " Did that one give you any trouble ? " " He came up and shook my hand , " Jonas said . " That was sporting . " " Fuckim . " " Check , " said Ira . " Where are you going ? " " No place . Home . " " What are you going to do home ? " " Nothing . Take a shower . " " And after the shower ? " " I do n't know . Nothing .

" " Sometimes , " Jonas replied , smiling at he knew not what , but presciently . " I thought so , " Ira said sorrowfully . " You must n't take naps on Sunday afternoons , Jonas . Particularly on hot Sunday afternoons . A man who does that is taking his spiritual life in his hands . How do you feel when you wake up from a Sunday-afternoon nap ? " " Great , " Jonas said . " Refreshed . " " Oh , my God ! " Ira whispered . " Listen , take a shower and come downtown with me . " " To do what ? " " To do anything . To see a movie . " " What movie ? " " You know , Jonas , I thought there was some reason why from this great big world you 've chosen me . Unconsciously your soul was seeking salvation . " " Who chose whom ? " Jonas wished to know . " You phoned me . Remember ? " " That 's the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dying ? " Jonas asked . " Yes , " Ira replied . " But much more afraid of not living . " Ira walked up the two flights with Jonas , entered the apartmentp68with him . No one was at home . Ira watched the Mallomar-and-milk ritual with beneficent interest . He found it supremely right that Jonas should eat and drink hugely of Mallomars and milk . That was the kind of sustenance Jonas 's flesh needed . " Where 's your family ? " Ira asked . " Mother ? Father ? Brothers ? Sisters ? " Jonas told him . " I have a brother , " Ira said . " Older . He 's married now . A lawyer . I know him less than I know you . Oh , much less . We became estrangedas kids , I guess , and for nearly two decades we walked around in the same house and never made contact . We must have been quite young when we decided we did n't like each other . Not hate . I do n't think it was ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to each other . You see , my father is a prominent doctor , on the staff at Mount Sinai . And my mother is a committee woman . A big lady in the Hadassah . Everybody in my family has a busy life . Sociallyuseful . Except me , of course . Their time is well spent . Our name is sterling in the community . We are very well known , except to each other . I exaggerate , but not much . Anyway , in this atmosphereI went around a little starved most of the time . My brother is a natural product of the environment . Early  --  very early , I would say  --  he knew that what he wanted out of life was simply the best of everything . Best in the snotty sense . The best clothes . The best school . The best fraternity . The best people for friends . Well , after I knew I did n't have a brother to speak of , I watched this phenomenonat work with considerable interest , I can tell you . I wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where do you think he wound up ? He 's married to the daughter of a chain of women 's apparel shops . They do a gross volume of umpteen million a year . As a little wedding present , they gave my brother all their legal business  --  and they are litigious bastards . Now they have a child  --  my brother and his wife , not the business . Little Rhoda . You look at her and get lightheaded from such dazzling human perfection . What does it all mean ? I ask myself . He must be unhappy . Justice demands that he be unhappy . Let me ask you , Jonas : do you think he 's unhappy ? " " No , " said Jonas.  | " I see you know the ways of life , " Ira said . " You 're right . He 's happy . Take a shower , my friend . You stink . " Jonas took a shower and dressed . He left a note that he would not be home for dinner , then he and Ira took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A man in ballet tights swimming across a large mirror and falling through with a nerve-shattering crash . A woman 's moist mouth embedded in the palm of a man 's hand , speaking libidinously in the privacy of that surrealistic dream . Floatingthrough hotel corridors , opening doors , and that darkly melodiousvoice undulating French throughout . . . . Jonas came out into the warm street half-drunk on exoticism . This was the first foreign film he had seen . " And what did you make of that ? " Ira asked . " Dreams , " said Jonas . " Yes , " said Ira . " This makes the third time I 've seen it . It 's great . You hungry ? " " Yes . " " Let 's eat . " The sinuous French voice kept weaving through Jonas 's brain , insistent and disturbing . He felt as though he had taken in a strange , suspect food ; his whole being heaved indecisively between nausea and acceptance . George 's candy store was a childish depravity . What he had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  although he could n't say how . Ira chose a restaurant . They ate veal in spiced sauces and drank dry red wine . Ira said that Jonas was to be his guest , and Jonas said like hell , nobody paid his check . " Why not ? " Ira asked . " I 'm not your date , for Christ sake , " Jonas said . Ira studied Jonas with wry surprise , and then he grinned his unfortunategrin , tightening the flesh across his thrusting nose and creating two white points at the irregular vertex of bone . " Nobody pays my check , ' " he mimicked , wagging his head in imitative belligerence . " Now you sound like a real grub yon . " " What 's a grobyon ? "  | " A grobyon is a Philistine who takes pride only in his money or his balls . Jonas , a friendly gesture from another man does n't deprive you of your manhood . " " Hey , listen --  " Jonas began to complain . " I 'm listening . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pay your own check . " " Do n't get sore . " " I 'm not sore , " Ira said . " I 'm saying this for your own sake . You 're always in a football crouch . Stand up , Jonas . Be a little gentle . The world will love you . You 're the lovable type . " The bread Jonas ate had a grainy texture and was the color of buckwheat groats . Spread with butter and dipped into the sauce ( Jonas followed Ira 's example ) , it gave to Jonas 's mouth a farrago of tastes that made him as greedy as a young pig . He eyed the bread jealously , and was delighted that Ira took so little of it . He could have eaten loaves all by himself . The wine he drank perpetuated the thirst it assuaged , and was as needful to this meal as a left hand to a right , and apparently could be taken in any quantity without effect . " What makes me so lovable ? " Jonas asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoil it if you became selfconscious . " " Do me a favor , " Jonas requested . " Let me spoil it . Damned if I want to be lovable . " " On the other hand , how could you spoil it , " Ira reflected . " Can you change the color of your eyes ? the shape of your nose ? the Mallomar innocence of your blood ? " " Ira , you 're lovable , too , " Jonas said , taking more bread . " I 'm eating all of this bread , " he apologized . " I ca n't help it . It 's deli-cious . " " Think nothing of it . Eat . You played handball like a god today . ... No , Jonas , I 'm not lovable . I 'm ugly . But talented . Incidentally , if you 're not doing anything in particular this coming Wednesday evening , why do n't you come down to the studio ? I 'll give you the address . We 're rehearsing a few scenes from a revue Frank Mulloy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a guy is Frank Mulloy ? " Jonas asked  | " A nice guy . Very intelligent . Brilliant . His only trouble is that he has no talent . I 'm not being underhanded . Frank knows it . He 's too clever not to . But theatre is his love , his first and only and forever love . It 's really amazing how far intelligence will carry a man . Frank acts , not well , but acts . He remembers how the good ones do it , and he tries to imitate . What comes across is imitation . He writes  --  intelligently , with wit  --  but without originality . He directs with a lot of business , but no inspiration . Frankly , I do n't know what will happen to Frank . He 'll probably be a great success some day , and die frustrated . " " And Ruth Klein ? " Jonas asked . " Ruth Miller ? " " Beh-meh . " " No good ? " " Adequate . " " How come she 's married to Alex ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is it ? Why ? You mean their ages ? Alex is only about ten years older than Ruth . Maybe fifteen . I do n't know . But Alex is a gifted man . I ca n't stand him most of the time , but he is gifted . Not great . I do n't think he 's great , but he has a style that 's all his own . " " Style in what ? " " Painting . He 's an artist . He also does lettering . Beautiful stuff . He gets a lot of work from the advertising agencies . Makes good money . I never think of Alex and Ruth as individuals . They go together . Alex and Ruth . . . Jonas , do n't have that piece of bread , for the love of God . Leave room for dessert . " " Dessert ? " " Cheesecake . Italian cheesecake . Believe me , you 'll wet yourself . " Ira ordered cheesecake , but Jonas remained dry . A little too bland . He was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cake should be full of nuts . This stuff promised , but fell just short of cakedom . Jonas took careful note of the restaurant 's location as they left . He would come here again some day , soon , perhaps with Debbie and Solomon . Maybe on Debbie 's birthday , which was almost at hand ... August . Ira guided Jonas through unfamiliar streets , now mostly quiet andp72night-fallen . They came to a street that was full of shops , all closed except for a delicatessen or a drugstore , and Jonas said , " I have to buy a present for my sister . Her birthday is in August . I always buy her the same things . Perfume or stationery with her name imprinted . I 'd like to buy her something different for a change . You 're a man of the world . Give me a good idea . " " Delighted , " Ira said . " But first you must tell me about your sister . How old is she ? " " She 'll be twenty-six . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Errol Flynn or John Garfield ? " Oh , my God ! Norman ! " John Garfield , " Jonas replied . " Does she cry easily ? " " She never cries . " " Do you think she 's pretty ? " " Do I think so , or is she ? " Jonas asked . " She is . " " Are you very fond of her ? " " What difference does that make ? " " It makes a great deal of difference , " Ira said . " A gift should represent the giver as well as please the givee . " " Yeah , I like her . Sure . " " Very much ? " " Hey , forget it . " " All right . Strike that from the record . The witness does n't have to answer the last question . Leading and irrelevant . One last question : how much money do you want to spend ? " Jonas was suddenly caught up in a billow of extravagance . He wanted Debbie to have something resplendent , costly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care , " he said . " A hundred dollars . " " Ridiculous , " Ira said with a wave of the hand . " She 'd make you take it back . Here . Come here . " Ira led Jonas to a darkened store front . In the window were handembroideredgarments from Balkan countries , blouses and skirts beautifully decorated by peasant skill and patience . Ira 's advice was to buy such a blouse  --  there , that one , the white one with thep73tassels  --  and to buy the skirt with it . For a woman who prefers John Garfield to Errol Flynn , who is pretty in her brother 's eyes and who never cries , that would be the gift . She would never buy such a thing for herself , but would look at it longingly a thousand times . More significantly , such a gift could , and should , come from brother Jonas . It would be a magnificent leap of the imagination , but a believable one . See , there were the price tags . The blouse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by God , for a brother to a sister ! Jonas was poleaxed with desire ! He wanted that skirt and blouse ! Now ! Tomorrow would be too late ! Somebody would be waiting at the store at nine o'clock Monday morning , money in hand , ready to snatch the inimitable prize away . Never , never would he have thought to buy such a gift for Debbie , but now that it had been pointed out to him he knew it to be the gift , the perfect gift , the gift for Debbie . She would open the box and look down at it and touch it with a consecrating hand . Now  --  there  --  the owner 's name , in gold letters , on the door  --  how many H. L. Dorfmans could there be in the telephone book ? But which telephone book ? Ira reasonably asked . They would try them all , was Jonas 's unreasonable answer . It would be fun , after a fashion . At least they could get the man to reserve that particular skirt and blouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be willing to travel to wherever it was the man lived and give him a deposit ... . Coaxingly , Ira led Jonas away from the store , explaining that retail shops carried more than one of each item , that those articles in the window had probably been there for months , that he must n't be so impetuous , that he 'd had too much wine . Tomorrow would be time enough . Besides , he must know his sister 's size . Did he know his sister 's size ? No , of course not . All rush and no reason . Besides there were two dozen such shops within a three-block area around here , all of them loaded with similar things . What was the matter with him anyway ? Jonas yielded . They took the subway home . Ira sat hunched up , dispirited , his hands shoved between his thighs.  | " Death , " he said , " is the unbearable condition of life . That life goes on is the unbearable condition of death . To kill and kill and kill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Hitler knows , and what his adoring people suspect about him . " Jonas thought about the skirt and blouse . Before they parted , Ira reminded Jonas again about Wednesday night . " About seven-thirty , eight , " he said . He took out a little leather book that carried a tiny pencil in a tiny holster and he wrote out the address for Jonas.  |p75Tuesday  was the Fourth . Radio commentators the previous evening had sounded deep chords on the day 's meaning . The note of urgency vibrated over the air , as though this IndependenceDay might be the last Americans would be privileged to celebrate , or possibly the last they would celebrate without proving themselves worthy of the privilege . Miraculously the voices changed to brightness and optimism as they spread the word on hair tonic and cigarettes . With bubbly good cheer , they predicted the number of citizens who would be killed on the road and mutilated by fireworks . The weather would be hot . The exodus would be colossal . The Fair would be jammed . The beaches would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for only the very sensible and very dull to stay at home . Solomon said , " Do you know yet , Debbie , when you will get your vacation ? " " I have a choice , " she replied . " The second week in August , or the last . " " The second week is your birthday , " Jonas pointed out . " I know , " Debbie said . " I think I 'll take the last . And you , Pa ? " " I do n't know yet , " he said . " Jonas ? " Debbie asked . " Ackerman said he 'd be closing down one week in August for inventory , " Jonas replied . " I do n't know which week yet . " " What is everybody doing tomorrow ? " Debbie asked . Everybody was wondering what everybody else was doing . Everybodywanted to do something , but each had feared disarranging the other 's plans.  | " Let 's go to the beach , " Debbie suggested . " We 'll get an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the refrigerator . " " Great ! " Jonas applauded . " All right , " said Solomon . " Their " beach was beyond the reach of subways , Long Beach , where they had once spent a summer while Rose Gould still lived . It meant a two-hour trip , but the trains were as yet uncrowded as they tunneled beneath the city , and out again into the open on the Long Island Railroad . They rented lockers for the day at a bathhouse , and were on the wide stretch of sand before eleven o'clock . Jonas clowned a sleepwalking trance toward the surf , arms outstretched , eyes closed , continuing on into the ocean like an amphibiantoo long deprived of his other element . He plowed ahead until he was waist-high , and then he arched forward into the swellinghump of a wave , swimming breast stroke beneath the surface so long that Debbie and Solomon , watching him from the beach , becamealarmed . He surfaced at last , wallowing luxuriously , revolving round and round on his own axis , as on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jogged over to the spread blankets , shedding brine and felicity . " Good ? " asked Debbie . " Do n't ask . Go . " " I will . Later . " Solomon reclined on a rented beach chair . His body , untouched by the sun for a year , still had the appearance of something processedin a tannery . His dugs sagged , the hair on his chest was completelywhite , but his ribs showed clearly beneath the taut flesh . He looked no younger than he was , but his firm principle of moderation had left him with a body that had simply aged , and had not become a gross accretion of flabs and humors . He let out a long sigh and rubbed his thighs and knee joints with the ointment heat of the sun . Debbie wore a blue bathing suit and a blue ribbon in her hair . Her body , too , partook of the Gould heaviness of bone , but in its own distinctive way . Her shoulders were firmly rounded but narowlyset , and her torso carried out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swell of hip , buttock , and thigh . The disjunction was sudden , but feminine , attractive . It compelled ap77man 's attention . It elicited a corresponding tic in a man 's groin  --  almost before his senses were aware of the reason . Jonas , who had seen his sister in a bathing suit many times before , who had seen her in slips and , inadvertently , even less , observed , and then by a long-practiced process , depersonalized the observation . Like the vast intricacies of a dial-system exchange , the contact points of Jonas 's own system fled past circuits and stopped only at those time and censorship had selected for completion . He stretched out on a blanket and turned his face to the sun . A parade of bacteroid specks floated across the medium of his inner lid , moving from west to east . The sun adhered to his body like a warmed layer of new flesh . His brain felt delightfully dulled , an infantrocked by surf sound , all senses gratified . When Solomon spoke to Debbie , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonas 's consciousness , no more . And when Debbie replied , her words looped above him , tenuous and rainbow-hued . He knew what they were talking about , and he was interested , but his interest was that of a boy who listens to adult voices from another room . He could choose involvement only if he wished to . They were talking about a recent letter from Aunt Selma . Periodically , Aunt Selma would write to her sister 's family ; an obligation , it would seem , she felt she owed to the memory of her sister . When such a letter was received , it was left for Debbie to open , even though it was addressed to " Mr. Sol Gould . " Debbie was the only one who could decipher Aunt Selma 's scrawl . And after she had read it , Debbie would put the letter on the shelf of the kitchen cabinetwhere it would remain for days , untouched by either Solomon or Jonas . At times she would bring it to their attention , and Solomon would make an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines he would toss it aside in disgust . He could n't make out a word , and if by chance he did make out a word he very quickly appreciated the virtues of illegibility . . . . But there was this latest letter from Aunt Selma , and Debbie was scolding that neither of them had even looked at it . Solomon asked what was the latest news from Hartford . Debbie replied that everybody was fine . Sidney was helpinghis papa in the business . Jean expected to have her baby the first week in September . . . . But Debbie was announcing here andp78now that as far as she was concerned that letter would remain unansweredfor eternity . It was really disgraceful . After all , they had lived with these people , all of them , not just herself , Solomon and Jonas , too ! Solomon agreed . Debbie was right . He had been neglectful . He would write . . . . But the funny thing , he reflected , the funny thing was how little he could remember of those two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Over seven hundred days ! And all he could remember was the radio blaring in the evening ... . No , that was n't quite all he could remember . There was something else he remembered  --  did they ?  --  how on Sundays they would go off by themselves to that restaurant , just the three of them . That large quiet restaurant with the linen napkins and silverware fit for a king 's hand . The food was n't very good  --  in fact it was terrible  --  but they loved it ! Did Debbie and Jonas remember how they found that place ? How they were taking a walk and Jonas had to go to the bathroom very badly , not a second to spare , as usual ; and so they walked into the first place they could find ; that restaurant ; and thereafter , every Sunday , they went . The old waiter came to know them , sat them at the same table every week . " The little Princess , " he called Debbie , and " Jackie Coogan " was his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Debbie ? " " I remember , " Debbie said . " I ordered something different every week . Jonas wanted only chicken . " " Ice cream for dessert , " said Solomon . " Then the park , " Debbie said . " How far was it ? Did we walk ? " " Sure walk . On Sunday you could wait an hour for a trolley . We walked to the restaurant , and then to the park , and then home . I remember once , a cold day ... " Jonas prayed for the voices to continue . He felt embowered by the voices . Wave after wave of goose flesh started behind his ears and rippled downward along his neck , his back , into a tingling confluenceat the base of his spine . He remembered , too . He remembered the restaurant , the waiter , the silverware , particularly the knife , which felt like the haft of a sword in his hand . He remembered the immensity of possession he felt when they sat around that table in the restaurant , each endowed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of them , yet each belonging to him , and he belonging to them . He remembered the park , and the cold like a band of steel encircling his head . He remembered Solomon lifting him before the high , awful urinal in the park 's publictoilet , and he unable to free his penis in time , wetting himself . He remembered the ice-pink cirrus feathering downward behind buildingsthat would remain forever grim and unfriendly . He rememberedremembering , and in doing so he passed through strata of himself , tasting the special time-flavor confined within each layer . He felt spread on a rack of years , and each word was a click of the ratchet , stretching him . But there was no pain in the stretching , only an endless elongation of himself so that he could feel the curvature of the earth beneath him . He was stretched over the world . His head was in Long Beach sand , his feet in the Sahara . He spanned oceans . He fervently wished his father and sister to go on talking , stretching him so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I 'll take a swim now , " said Debbie . " I 'm ready , too , " said Solomon . Jonas rolled over on his stomach , then slowly got to his feet . They had lunch soon after . Debbie had prepared hard-boiled eggs , sardine sandwiches , quarters of tomato , fresh peaches and pears , a Thermos of iced tea . The beach was crowded now . Solomon said , " Tell me , Debbie , why is it that when a new employee comesinto a place , the first week he always misses out on one or two days ' pay ? " " Always ? " Debbie said . " Not always . It depends on the day of the week he comes in . Each company figures its pay roll from a certain day of the week . " " Is that necessary ? " Solomon asked . " The person is n't cheated , " Debbie explained . " When he quits , or is fired , he gets whatever is due him . " " And supposing he works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that two days ' pay is owed to him ? " " It 's on the books . . . . Why ? " " I do n't like the system , " Solomon said . " Why ? " Debbie asked again.  |p80Solomon  considered a while before answering . Jonas and Debbie looked at him . His Tartar eyes became even more oblique in their cast . Both children had seen that look before . " This is Herr Dubin 's delightful system , " he said . " So ? " Debbie challenged . " It 's his system . " " I think it 's unnecessary , " Solomon said , his voice beginning to prowl around in its gut-rumbling registers . " Human ingenuity , it seems to me , can find a way of paying a worker a full-week 's wage for a full-week 's work . The bookkeeping inconvenience would n't be so terrible . " Debbie exchanged a look with Jonas . He saw her nostrils tense . " Pa , why do n't you mind your own business ? " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own business ? It 's such an insignificant matter . Thousands of companies do it . It 's an established practice . " " That does n't make it right , " her father returned . " The company is richer and smarter . Let them use their cleverness to convenience the worker for a change . I do n't say their purpose is to cheat , but you 'll never make a worker understand why he must loan money to the company to finance their bookkeeping . " " I do n't approve of it either , " Debbie admitted . " But it 's been going on for a long time , and you or I are not going to change it . " " As long as people accept it , it wo n't change . When people no longer accept it , it will change . " There was no use arguing with Solomon . His voice had burrowed into the rich dark subsoil where all Solomonish things took root . His face was serene . He looked like a man about to tell an edifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knew the tale ; they had heard it many times ; they had listened to deceptively innocent beginnings , thinking that perhaps this time a different plot and ending were intended  --  or none at all  --  only to find that it was indeed the same story ; only the names and locale had been changed . And the endings , too , were invariably the same : Solomon Gould was out of a job . The telling of the tale signaled the beginning of the end , and the remarkable thing , considering , was that the tale had n't been told many more times . Solomon Gould 's children knew that their father could no more prevent his actions than a born martyr could re/nounce his mission . Fate itself seemed anxious to play a role in the ritual drama , for though Solomon had been a union man in convictionhis whole life , had helped in organizing efforts several times , he had never been a member of one . Some freakish little twist had alwayskept him out . The category of his occupation , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A maintenance man ? Yes  --  but . Organizers had told him he would have to negotiate on his own with some electricians ' or mechanics ' union . Once the boss had used Solomon as a bargaining point during negotiations with a local union . Solomon 's skill was unique . He kept old machines running . Sewing machines of all types . Employers would n't have minded callingin expert mechanical help , would have paid whatever was necessary , but the time that was lost ! Solomon could sit down at a machine , run it a few seconds , and he was already reaching into his back pocket for a screwdriver . Fifteen minutes later , the machine was operating properly . In a large steel box ( always locked ) , Solomonkept a private hoard of parts , collected through the years , and he could always find the one piece that would substitute for another . Wherever he had worked , the employer had wanted very much to stay on good terms with Solomon . As far as wages were concerned , Solomon did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first employers made Solomon something of a pet , since he was intelligent , colorful , and a faultless worker . In a half-calculating way , Solomon'sbosses hoped to make his worth and wages more commensurateby a way of a little patronization , and in doing so they set a trap for which they could blame no one but themselves . Slowly , by degrees , Solomon would invade the ethical life of his employer . It was not that he merely wanted the man he worked for to honor contractsand keep verbal promises , but to be a better man . He , a vagabondin the needle trade , would try to foist his own sense of values on men who had lived through the savageries of New York competition . One did n't have to look very hard to find injustices in the lofts around Seventh Avenue , and when Solomon found them it was as if a hand had been laid on his shoulder . It would begin innocuously enough . A deferential suggestion , something Solomon was certain Mr. So-and-So would wish to knowp82and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct an injustice or an abuse , but whether he did or not it would never stop there . " Gould , " one maddened employer had once roared at him , " what the hell do you want from me ? Who elected you the keeper of my conscience ? "  --  and in roaring so , had come closer to the mark than anyone before or since , because what Solomon was after was not injustice for the sake of reform , but reform for the sake of the perpetrator of injustice . Since returning to New York from Hartford , Solomon had held five different jobs . Two he had quit , unable to effect the needed reform . Two had fired him , with shrill imprecations . He was on his fifth . Jonas knew what was in the air now , but he attached no great importance to it . So Solomon would get another job . He always had in the past . he would again . In fact , Jonas took a secret , amused pride in his father 's misadventures . He realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later would count against him , but he liked the picture of his father as a sort of Slavic Quixote too pure to compromise his principles and too competent to be long out of a job . Jonas had always assumed that Debbie felt the same , but obviously she did not . She was peeved . She was silent . She kept her face turned away from both father and brother , until Solomon was forced to ask what was the matter , what had he said , he was only seeking a point of information . .. . " I know , " said Debbie . " And also to give me some information . " " What information , Debbie ? " Solomon asked . " That you 're getting ready to change jobs . " " And even if this were true , why should it affect you ? " Debbie 's gaze was out toward the ocean . Jonas could n't see whether she looked sad or ironic when she said , " Nothing affects me . " She turned to her father in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaded into their soft opalescent color . " Why do I worry so much ? " she asked . " I do n't know , " her father answered . His hand described a semicircle , taking in all that could be seen in either direction . " Look around you , " he invited . " Do you see two better men ? " " I do n't have to look , " Debbie said . " You 're the best . Both of you . "  | " So why should you worry ? . . . Jonas , do you think your sister has anything to worry about ? " " Not a thing , " Jonas said . " I 'll put it in writing . " " I tell you what , " Solomon announced . " We 'll have dinner here at the shore . I still remember a place we went to once . First-class cuisine . Everything fried . All right ? " At five o'clock , they began to gather their things . Solomon and Jonas bent down at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face brushed the upper part of his father 's arm . The special pungency of sun-warmed , salted flesh reminded him of the times when Solomon would carry him to the surf , murmuring those assuranceswhich had become the litany of his seaside terror . Once , as a child , he had feared the water , but he had learned that neither tears nor writhing violence could prevent that jogging ride to the ocean 's edge . So he had submitted , face pressed sideways against Solomon 's shoulder , taking in with each breath and heartbeat the sun-salt-and-flesh odor of what must be . And now he loved the sea . And so all things would be . . . and change . . . whether he willed them or not.  |p84The  Studio Theatre was small and inhumanly hot . There were windows open on either side of the place , but they gave out on solid brick walls with not even a cornice in sight down which a random breeze might glide . Stacks of folding chairs leaned against the walls , while others , opened , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of metallic gray seen on boiler-room floors . Six sweating people were on the stage  --  including Ira and Frank Mulloy  --  and about twice as many sweated on the folding chairs and window sills . Cigarettes were constantly being lighted . Fresh infusions of blue smoke provided almost too much realism to the combustible atmosphere . Jonas sat on one of the folding chairs . Every so often the perspirationgathered in his armpits would start on a trickling ride down his ribs . Some sort of skit had been in progress when he had entered the studio , but it broke off quickly and several cross-purpose conversationsensued . Frank Mulloy scratched his eyebrow with a pinky nail as he spoke to Ira . He looked aristocratically unhappy . Ira presented a characteristic pose : hands on hips , head back and to one side , listening . Jonas gathered that the scene in question was taking place in a doctor 's office , that Ira was the patient , and that the whole thing was not nearly pointed enough in satire or broad enough in comedy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the doctor's-scene , " Ira said . " Cut it and go right into the subway scene . " Frank nodded . " I think you 're right . Let 's take it up where the doctor gives him advice and cut everything before ... Someone sat down next to Jonas . He turned . It was Ruth MillerKlein.  | " Hello , " she said . " Hi , " said Jonas . " God , this heat ! " she whispered . " Terrific , " said Jonas . " You in this ? " " No . . . I mean I do n't know . There 's really nothing to be in . Have they done the skit yet ? " " Just talking about it . " " Are you becoming interested in theatre ? " Ruth asked him . Jonas shook his head . " Ira asked me to drop in , " he explained . Frank Mulloy turned an annoyed face toward the room . " All right , " he said , " we 'd like to hear each other up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's improvise the doctor 's scene ... . Tod , you 've examined Ira  --  Joe Fright  --  before . You 've taken X rays , blood tests , et cetera . You find nothing wrong with him . You tell him it 's a state of mind , that he must adopt a new attitude , a new outlookon life . . . and then we 'll go right into the subway scene . .. . Now this time , I 'd like to have the rest of you really simulate a subway ride . I mean  --  let 's exaggerate it . A little , anyway . I do n't think we 'd be violating any rules if we made a sort of . . . ballet out of it . Do you know what I mean ? The swaying , the lurching , the dirty looks . . . Okay ? . . . All right , Tod ... . Tod Taylor , nee Schneider , sat down behind the table on the stage . He was wearing a doctor 's smock  --  or a counterman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he faced around toward Tod . He pretendedthere was a door in front of him and knocked . " Come in ! " boomed Tod . Ira winced . He opened the imaginary door and sidled into the imaginary office , head tipped Ira-fashion , a wretched little smile on his lips . " Well , Mr. Fright , " Tod thundered once more , and Ira shuddered under the impact of each word . . . Frank broke in at this point with instructions to Tod to temper his heartiness a bit . That kind of volume was enough to make a normal man cringe . What was wanted was just enough robustness to counterpoint Ira 's timidity and jumpiness . . . . " He 's such a ham , " Ruth whispered to Jonas . " Who is ? " Jonas whispered back . " Tod . Ira makes him look sick . "  |p86They  went on with the scene . Doctor Tod told patient Ira that everything had checked out just fine . Heart normal , blood okay , metabolism tiptop , urine unsugared  --  and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he were being left-jabbed into a state of perfect health . He remained in that cockeyed position after Tod had finished his glowing report . Then he gave a quick nod and started to speak . What issued from him was a strangled croak , natural enough for a man in that position , but then Ira cleared his throat with a noise so perfectly fractured , so convincingly ghastly , that spectators and players were momentarily stunned into wonder . Then they began to laugh , those on stage most of all . Frank Mulloy lowered his head and shook it admiringly . Tod Taylor , with true theatrical extravagance , collapsed forward on his arms , shoulders heaving . Next to Jonas , Ruth Klein covered her face with her hands and joined the tribute to Ira . It was truly funny . Jonas did n't have to be told that no one had coached Ira into that astonishing bit . No one could have . Noises like that are born on the spot . A man would have to be scared , his throat dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to happen . " Just a natural ! " Ruth said to Jonas , her voice unstinting in its admiration . Ira was  --  natural  --  for nothing had happened on stage which revealeda new , a hidden Ira . The remarkable thing to Jonas was that Ira could be himself , completely , on the stage . Thus would Ira have walked into a real doctor 's office ( not his father 's ; another 's ) , hypochondriacaland afraid . With just such suspicion would he have listened to the back-thumping medical joviality . Finding his voice after all that terror and retreat would have occasioned just such a pitiable gargle . And still Ira sat in the doctor 's office ( while others laughed ) , nursing his untouched and untouchable pessimism . He saw nothing funny in his plight . Laughter deepened his distress . Frank Mulloy raised an arm and loudly snapped his finger 's . Tod collected himself and asked Ira what he thought was troubling him . Ira thought he was troubled by headaches , stomach-aches , dizzy spells , spots before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe he worried too much ? Doctor Tod agreed . No doubt hep87worried too much . Well , he must stop worrying . Look up ! Make contact with humanity ! Be of good cheer ! Adopt new attitudes . ... Right ! He would ! . . . Thank you , doctor . Handshake . Out . . Frank signaled for a change of scene . The other performers collectedchairs and lined them up at the rear of the stage . Ira pantomimed a walk in the streets . The carbonation of a new day fizzed up in his face . There was bounce in his step . He put his hands in his pockets and hitched up his spirit . His nose was a pennant . He jogged down an imaginary flight of stairs , fished for a coin , went through the turnstile , waited for a subway , went flying backward as the doorway vomited humanity , struggled through , went in , smiling . The other players took seats in the rear . Ira continued smiling , swaying , frenetically making contact . There . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ? Okay . He sat down . So ebullient he could hardly sit still . The person next to him was reading a newspaper . Wonderful ! Ira beamed , gave a little tuck to his head , congratulating his neighboron having a newspaper . The neighbor slid Ira a sour look . Then began the newspaper charade . Ira stole surreptitious glances . Gradualdiminution of joy . The newspaper reader flapped out his tongue and wet two fingers down to the second joint . Ira 's smile drooped , and he rubbed his fingers on his shirt front , vicariously drying the saliva . Another look . Another diminution . It was a hoary routine , but the interplay was not between Ira and his neighbor : it was betweenIra and the world . He was reading the news . He began to shrivel . The smile ended . He rolled his eyes upward . He swayed back and forth . His mouth formed an 0 of misery . He plunged his hands between his thighs . Down , down , down , hunched in bottomlessdespair , emitting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oy-yy-y-yi " And there was more laughter . And applause . Frank Mulloy once again shaking his head in wordless admiration . Tod doubled over . Ruth covering her face . . . . Jonas grinned , but mixed with amusementwas a confusion and an uneasiness . He wondered if the others knew that this was not simply Ira acting , but Ira . Or had those other occasions , those displays of real fear in the real world , been a tuneupfor this part ? Was there such a thing as a real Ira Hirsch ? A realp88Jonas Gould ? Or was all behavior a complicated piece of fakery ? I am this with you , something else with somebody else , a third pose with a third person , and somewhere inside was only the Mallomareateror the death-fearer . What did God have in mind ? Was it to be taken seriously ? Any of it ? Did Hitler really take himself seriously ? Was all consciousness a kind of hallucination ? And what would he say next to this girl-woman sitting beside him ? What would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipey , pudgy husband , Alex . " Boy , I had no idea Ira was that good , " he said . There ! That sounded like Jonas Gould ! . . . " Boy ! " " Someday , " said Ruth , " we 'll all be saying we knew Ira when . He 'll be famous . It 's inevitable . He 's such a natural . " " He 's a natural , all right , " Jonas heard himself repeat . On stage they were discussing the scene they had just played . There was great excitement among them . Ira had opened a surprisingdoor and had given them all a sudden view of possibility . Frank suggested they try another scene . Jonas stood up and pulled his shirt away from his skin . He was drenched . The warm strong odor of his body came up to him . " It 's hot , " he said . " Stifling , " Ruth said . " Is there a place to get a drink here ? " Jonas asked . " Here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I 'd love a drink . " They left the hall and walked down a flight of creaking stairs . Jonas ran his fingers over the embossed metal sheeting that covered the wall of the stair well . The egg-and-dart design conveyed in Braille the story of numberless old buildings where all sorts of crazy things were made and stored . . . . What would he say to Ruth ? Why was he made so uncomfortable by her friendliness ? The street was comparatively cool . There was a slight movement of air . The sweat began to dry on Jonas 's body . He maneuvered around to the other side of Ruth , the curb side . She inclined toward Sixth Avenue , so they began to walk in that direction . . . . Well . And now ? What shall he say ? Shall he say that it was hot ? She knewp89that . They had already gone into that quite thoroughly . Shall he talk about Ira ? Yes , Ira . What about Ira ? Shall he say that Ira 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ira 's being an actor , a comedian , whatever ? Why not ? A perfectly legitimate piece of information , and very much related to all that had gone before  --  and , incidentally , showing an interest in someone besides himself . But Ruth spoke first . She said , " You 're lucky . " What the hell was this ? Everybody was telling him how lucky he was . " Why am I lucky ? " he asked . " Not to be stage-struck , " she said . " Are you stage-struck ? " he asked . " I was . Maybe I still am . I do n't know . " " How about in here ? " Jonas suggested . They walked into a Liggett 's drugstore . A giant fan at the rear circulated the heat and the smell of fried bacon . They sat down at the counter and ordered Cokes . " Lemon Coke , " was what Ruth ordered , and Jonas felt a slight twinge of prejudice against such decadent refinements . People who ordered lime Cokes and cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on watermelon , which he 'd actually seen happen in a restaurant . To his left was a coffee cup with a crescent of lipstick on the rim . In the saucer was lying a coffee-soaked napkin . Another thing women do : they put paper napkins in saucers . These evidences of female peculiarity made him somehow less awkward , gave him a slightly better purchaseon his immediate situation . " Do you like acting ? " he asked . " Why do you think I do it ? " Ruth replied . " Oh , I do n't know , " Jonas said . " You do n't necessarily have to like something because you do it . I thought I would like college , but I did n't . I used to have a picture of myself wearing a crew-neck sweater and buckskin shoes and carrying a couple of books in my hand as I walked through a leafy campus . That 's what I liked , that picture . Have you by any chance ever seen the campus at TwentythirdStreet ? I did n't like college . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She really had a nice face , that inward line of the cheek setting off her mouth . And her skin was perfect , pure white ,  |p90without  a freckle or blemish , which in itself was rather an oddity , like a birthmark . What Jonas was finding particularly strange about this girl-woman was the total absence of a manner he had come to connect with all girls : the combination of guardedness and sly attention , present in infinitely varying degrees , but always present . Ruth Miller-Klein managed directness without losing femininity . Perhaps she could be that way because she was married . Perhaps she had gone beyond skittish boy-girl playfulness , knowing , as she did , what there was to know about sex . But despite her knowledge and her lack of skittishness , Ruth did not carry about with her the paradoxicalchastity Jonas 's raw nerves had detected in young married women . Ruth puzzled him . He could n't place her in a category of his own devising . She was serious . She was friendly . She moved as she wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I 'm sure your friend Ira has told you that . " " My friend Ira has n't told me anything of the sort , " Jonas lied . " Ask him some time , " Ruth said , looking pensive . " I wish I could give it up . You see , I have n't even got the drive . No one who was really ambitious would ever admit a thing like that , even if she believed it . Do you have any great ambition , Jonas ? " " I have n't discovered it yet , " Jonas said . " Did you want to be a great actress ? " " Must you use the past tense ? " Ruth said , smiling . " How do you know I 'm not just in a mood ? You should n't accept a woman 's evaluation of herself . " " Excuse me . " " You have nice teeth , " Ruth observed . " Of course I want to be a great actress , but I wo n't be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even that . " " Now , shall I believe that or not ? " Jonas asked . " You can believe it . " A faint catch in her voice made Jonas turn . Was she crying . Not exactly , but neither were her eyes dry . They were congested , glittering , and then the congestion was gone and her lashes were left damp and spicular . Jonas was at a loss . Should he recognize that embarrassing access of feeling ? Offer sympathy ? Reassurance ? Orp91should he pretend that he had n't seen it ? How peculiar . She hardly knew him . People do n't go around displaying that much emotion in front of comparative strangers . So he had thought . But apparently he was wrong . People do . Different people behave differently . " You know what I think ? " he said . " I think you 're in a mood . I 'll bet you 're very good . " " Thank you , " Ruth said , touching his hand briefly with her finger tips . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . I 'm not very good . " They left the drugstore and walked back in the direction of the studio . Without either of them expressing his wish , they continued on past the entrance of that moldy sweltering little building and came out on Broadway . There they turned north and strolled in the direction of the park . Ruth said she did n't know what she 'd do if she gave up the stage completely , or it gave her up . One must always allow for that . She assumed she 'd get a job somewhere . Try to , anyway . There was n't much she could do . She was n't a secretary , or switchboard operator , or anything like that . Probably she would wind up in the basement of some department store selling aprons to housewives . No , that would be too horrible . Perhaps she 'd go back to school , become a teacher . .. . And while she mused aloud , Jonas mused silently . He wondered about Alex Klein . Where , for instance , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's general scheme of things ? Do n't married people do things together ? Does n't a wife cook meals , bear children , and think of the future in terms of others , not herself ? His image of Ruth ( with a continuing lateral view of her bosom and hips ) alternatedbetween a girl he had just met and the wife of another man . His attitude toward either person would have been fairly simple and conventional , but he did n't know which attitude to apply . And since she seemed neither one nor the other , Jonas found himself adopting her easy confessional style . Why not ? By setting the mode , she obviated the usual penalties which attended a too-hasty revelation of himself . Not often , but on a few occasions in the past he had offered for another 's inspection a feeling , a fear , a hope , only to writhe in retrospection . It was like giving a girl a preposterous snapshot of yourself over which she could giggle and which shep92could show to her friends . But this girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snicker and made mutualitypossible . So when they reached the Byzantine twilight of Central Park South , Jonas was telling Ruth that he , too , faced things he could n't prevent or bring himself to like . As they walked along the roughhewnstone wall of the park , from beyond which came darker intensitiesof summer , he told her of a family where love had been shared in a somewhat different way . Not that there was anything remarkable in it  --  that sort of loss and disarrangement had happenedcountless times before . but where it might have become separateness and mere convenience , it had become instead somethingspecial . At least he thought so , looking around and seeing the fate of most families . . . and , well , of course he knew that it could n't and should n't go on forever , but now that it was ending he felt strange about it ... . " Why ending ? " Ruth asked . " I think my sister is going to get married , " he said . " And do n't you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  of course  --  naturally ... " He was on the point of describing the hopeless incongruity of Debbie and Norman B. Prager , but the portrait that leaped into his mind was not that of Norman but of Alex Klein . Alex with his paunch and pouch and pipe ; with his wiry hair and air of elder statesman . It passed swiftly , and a sharp , detailed image of Norman took its place . But the freakish displacement served to warn Jonas . It would be unwise to talk to Ruth about Norman . Strange that it had n't occurred to him before , but Norman and Alex , although they were quite different , nevertheless effected a kind of sameness when he thought of them in relation to Debbie and Ruth . Or was the sameness in the women and not in the men ? " Norman 's all right , I suppose , " he said . " Just not my ideal . " " Do you think any man would be ? " Ruth asked . " Yes , I think so . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Try to think of someone who would be your ideal . " " Frank Merriwell. "  | " Seriously . " " Franklin D. Roosevelt . " He laughed . " How can I possibly think of anyone ? Who that I know do you know ? Do you mean someone in the movies ? Well , let 's see . . . Gary Cooper ? No , he would n't be right . Too tall . Cary Grant ? Nope . Too handsome . " Jonas recalled Ira and that skirt and blouse , which he had not yet bought for all his quivering impatience that night . " John Garfield , " he said . " You know  --  tough , wise guy , but sensitive as hell underneath . " " The Four Daughters John Garfield , " Ruth suggested . " That 's the man ! " " John Garfield is nothing like you , " Ruth said . " Did I say he had to be like me ? " " Somehow I had the idea you would want him to be like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Jonas , do n't ever try to figure out why a woman chooses a particularman , " Ruth advised . " Why not ? " " It 's too complicated . " " I suppose so , " he said . " I would n't know . " They had come to the corner of Fifth Avenue , where Jonas had mistakenly hoped for a freshening breeze . He was sweating again . And his throat was terribly dry . At the same time he felt light , detached . He could , if he wished , say good-by to Ruth now , leave her standing at the corner with that little purse tucked under her arm and her arms cradled in that way , and his leaving would be understoodas part of the infinity of choice open to him . He could touch her , too , and she would look at him and say , " Yes ? " He could take her into the park , into the dark and danger of one of those arcades and kiss her on the lips , those nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then they would walk out again and continue to talk again about careers and ideal movie stars . Her patient attendance was the most solemn , thrilling , and certain thing he had ever known . When he saw a bus coming , he touched her elbow . She walked with him to the bus stop , and they boarded the bus . " Are you going back to the studio ? " she asked . " No , " he said . " There 's a store in Greenwich Village . I have to buyp94a birthday present for my sister . There 's a skirt and blouse I saw . I 'd like your opinion . Do you have to go home now ? " " No . " They went to the store , and Ruth approved of the skirt and blouse in the window . It was the sort of thing she would buy for herself . She hoped Jonas 's sister would like it . " She 'll like it , " Jonas said . Ruth looked at his wrist watch . " I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . They boarded a northbound Fifth Avenue bus . Ruth sat in the window seat . The breeze from the open window disorderedher hair , and she kept brushing the black strands away from her face , absently , as though they were spider 's webbing blown in from the street . It was now after ten o'clock , early for a summer 's night in Manhattan , but the avenue through the Twenties and Thirties was almost deserted . Jonas recognized a darkened Woolworthstore where he had once stopped to buy a dime's-worth of Bridge Mix , and he was pierced by a sudden sensation which entered and left his body in the erratic way of lightning . In that quick illumination , he saw himself crisscrossing streets , corners , and stores , tagging each with a state of mind ( here hope , there despair , there a causeless , mounting joy ) , so that at some unperceivable checkpoint in time this city would be labeled like luggage that had accompanied him on a multitude of foreign journeys . This knowledgemade him feel tender toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , the stones that would contain it were already known . " We can have lunch some time , if you like , " Ruth said . " Here , do you mean ? " Jonas asked . " In the city ? " " Yes . " " Where ? " " Where do you work ? " Jonas told her , and Ruth said she could meet him near by , in Madison Square Park . " Where 's that ? " " We just passed it . At Twenty-third Street . "  | " Oh , that . I did n't even know it had a name . When ? " Ruth thought . " Monday , " she said . " Next week . " " Fine . I go to lunch at twelve . It 'll take me about five minutes . Where will you be ? " " At the corner of Twenty-third and Fifth . " " All right . " They got off the bus at Ruth 's street . She said good-by , crossing the avenue and walking into the hushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was again aware of the emptinessof the avenue . But why should this be so ? Why did n't thousands come here on a hot summer evening and stroll about , borrowing splendor ? Hey , Norman ? Here 's the place for a sport like you . A classy evening in town for the price of a subway fare . Norman , are you really Debbie 's man ? Have you no shame ? Would you do a thing like that ? You 're an accountant , are n't you ? Does it balance ? Where 's the credit for that debit . . . Debbie . . . Debbiedebit . . . . Accompanying Jonas at every step was a sense of abeyance , something deliberately held at a distance . He would examine it later . Later he would turn it around in his hands , test its weight , determine its color . He returned to the studio , but it was now deserted . Folding chairs were scattered around , crushed butts on the floor , and that stale stink . Vividly Jonas recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horde of people . Even his clothes had become disarrayed in the elaborate make-believe ! Everything  --  the throatclearing , the new verve , the old despair  --  did n't seem to Jonas to be the artifice of acting but the reality of a Hirsch jailbreak . Ira out and running . What did all of this have to do with Gould ? Where the connection ? Jonas took the subway home . There was some relief there , the cellar coolness of a place hidden all day from a summer sun . He sat with the box containing Debbie 's gift in his lap , his left temple pressed against the windowpane , counting the dirty electric bulbs as they flicked by . He figured four to a block , and counted off the blocks from one station to the next . It never came out right . The station would appear before his count was complete , or he wouldp96finish his count and a ridiculous number of bulbs would go by beforethe train rolled into One-hundred-twenty-fifth Street ... . The game palled , his mind lay idle for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which waited for admittance . At the thought of Ruth , his stomach was scoured by a sudden chemistry . Glands poured their juices , stimulated by wonder , elation , pride , excitement , apprehension . He was forced to reconstruct her in the order and with those parts his memory provided . The line from cheekbone to chin ; her mouth ; her black hair ; her breasts ; the slow , hopelessly complex orchestration of everything below . It made his molars ache . He could actually feel the blood drain from his head , and he was left with a dizzying loss of pressure . His finger tips tingled . He closed his eyes and spoke her name with a heartwarmedbreath of longing : " Ruth . " " I was there last night , " Jonas told Ira over the phone the followingevening . " I did n't see you , " said Ira . " The place was a hellhole , " Jonas said . " I saw you do that skit , the one in the doctor 's office . Why did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I did . " " No , you did n't . You only said you were good . " " Then it must have come as quite a shock . " " Terrific , " Jonas admitted . " You were staggered . " " Yes , as a matter of fact , " Jonas said , a little suspiciously . " So much so that you could hardly wait to rush up and wring my hand . " " " Friend , it was hot in that place . " " Where 'd you go ? " Ira demanded . " Home ? I would have been happy to stand treat for the Mallomars and milk . " " Hey , are you sore about something ? " Jonas asked . " Sore ? Do n't be ridiculous . It 's hot . Where 'd you go ? " " Well , Ruth Klein was there , " Jonas explained . " She thinks you 're great , incidentally . She says you 'll be a big name some day . We went out for some air , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really terrific . Then we went out to get some air . When we came back , everybody was gone . " " Nice bit of air ! I did n't know you knew Ruth Klein . " " For crying out loud ! You introduced us ! That night . The night of the rally . Ruth , Alex , Adele , Tod , Frank Mulloy . . . You do remember that , do n't you ? " " So what did you do ? Screw her ? " " Well , yes , of course , " Jonas said , sensing the necessity of counteringIra 's irritation with patience . " But you know how those things are . Takes time . . . . What 's with you , Hirsch ? " " Nothing . . . . Jonas , I want to propose something to you , but I must have your promise first that you 'll listen with the better side of your nature . I know you have very strong Neanderthal impulses . " " What do you want to propose ? " " First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better side of my nature , " Jonas said . " I have fifteen hundred bucks , " Ira said . " Free and clear . No strings . I can spend it any way I choose . What would you say to a cross-country auto trip ? To California . The two of us . All expenses paid . There and back . " " I have a job , " Jonas said , thinking suddenly of Ruth Klein , and seeing at the same time cactus plants and snow-covered peaks . " So you have a job , " Ira said dismissingly . " You can get a hundred jobs like the one you 've got . I 'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . " " Why me ? " Jonas asked . " Because I 'm afraid to go by myself . With you , I would n't be afraid . " " So go by train . By plane . " " Ah , you 're an ape . I 'm in no hurry to get there . I want to make the trip slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those three thousand miles . " " Why do n't you stay here in New York and become famous ? " Jonas asked . " Because I ca n't stay here in New York and become anything , " Ira replied , his voice rising to a more precise , ringing level . " That is what I am trying to get at in my poor clumsy way . In New York , I'mp98paralyzed . In New York , I 'm dead . A gutted fowl , stuffed and greased , waiting for the oven . Do you understand what I 'm say-ing ? " " Sort of . " " Let it not be sort of , ' Jonas . Let me clarify it for you . I 've got to get away from my family , particularly my father . I guess I 'm pissing against the wind . You could n't possibly understand what I mean , because you 're a big chocolate baby beloved by father and sister . At the same time you 're a man , and probably have been since the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . I do , you see . I have to justify my existence in their terms , not my own . It would n't make a damn bit of difference how successful I am , because success would only mean that I 'd carried out my ambition to become a clown . That 's my father 's word for it . Clown . ' As you can imagine , I 'm not being overheard . So if they wo n't accept me , then I 've got to reject them . That 's the way it works , Jonas . Sad but true . I need help . Once I get to California , I can go to Los Angeles . Maybe I can get a job in the movies . Three thousand miles of immunity is what I 'm talking about ! " " I can understand that , " Jonas said , trying to be placating . " What I do n't understand is how I can help you . What you need are the three thousand miles . You can get them without me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't see how I can help you . " " Would it change your mind if you did see how you could help me ? " " Boy ! You 're really  --  ! I mean , Ira , I 've got a family , too . And a job . I just ca n't pick up and go . " Even over the phone , Jonas could feel Ira 's turning away . The answer was indeed no , they both knew it , and further discussion would only go toward covering the traces of a disappointment whose extent Jonas had no way of gauging . No more than a week ago , he would have refused to credit the possibility of real disappointment . FIe had always imagined that affection , friendship were states of being whose increase could come about only in time . A week of friendship meant a week of exchanges and understandings . Small accumulation . A month was that much more . And a yearp99might show an increment whose loss could be felt severely . That was a week ago . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little into himself , into Ira , and he understood that the increment was there to begin with , within himself , and could be made to spill over its superfluity from one moment to the next . " You playing handball Sunday ? " Ira asked . " I suppose so , " Jonas replied . Then , quickly , " Listen , it does n't make a difference whether you 're here or three thousand miles away . You 're going to be a success . Everybody knows that . " " Thanks . Maybe I 'll see you on Sunday . " " Okay . " " So long . " " So long . " Another thing Jonas suspected  --  or by this time possibly knew  --  was that selfishness and sympathy could move about and gesticulate in the same head and never once get in each other 's way.  |p100Summer  simmered quietly . Goering was on vacation . The world learned that he enjoyed lion cubs for pets . Goebbels amused his countrymen with humorous sarcasms on the nervousness of the British . Hitler visited an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in society . He said the artist should draw his inspirationfrom the times , and he lamented the lack of good art in Germany at this time . Solomon took it all as a sign . He could n't say which way the sign tended , but he felt certain it was a step away from the previous direction . He did n't mention Mr. Dubin and his questionable pay-roll system . Debbie said she would leave on Friday , after work , and spend the week end with a girl friend whose family had a summer place near Ellenville . Solomon inquired about transportation , and Debbie told him that transportation would be provided . A car . She expected to be home late Sunday night , but if it seemed advisable  --  traffic , weather , the convenience of others  --  she might stay an extra night and leave very early Monday morning . In that case , she would go directly to her office . They were not to worry if she did n't come home on Sunday . Solomon nodded . He could think of no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her adolescence . Jonas could . He said , " This friend would n't also be a friend of Norman 's , would she ? " " The friend is Norman 's cousin , " Debbie returned simply . " Why ? " " Just asking . "  | " Why are you just asking ? " " I 'm keeping a diary , " Jonas said . " Whose life ? " Solomon rumbled . " If you do n't come home on Sunday , how do we know whether you 're staying over or smashed up somewhere in a car accident ? " Jonas said to Debbie . " Is that what you 're worried about ? " Debbie asked . " Jonas , go down and take a walk , " Solomon advised . But Debbie softened . " I 'll phone if I decide not to come back on Sunday . " " No , Debbie , you will do nothing of the kind , " Solomon put in . " Pa  --  " " Debbie , " Solomon intervened . " Now I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to phone . I do n't want you to think about it . Is that clear , Jonas ? Are you listening to what I 'm saying ? " " Yes , boss . " " Good . Any more questions ? " " Just one , " Jonas said . " What are your week-end plans ? " " The usual things , " Solomon replied . " Polo , yachting ... " " Are you going to play chess ? " Jonas asked . " If you 'd like to do something , I 'm at your disposal . " " I have something to do , " Jonas said . " I 'm glad to hear it , " Solomon said . " Then I have your permission to go about my business ? " " What a witty family we are , " Jonas said . " I wonder , do you all realize what a witty family we are ? I 'm going down to get some ice cream . " " That 's nice , " Solomon said . " Remember Debbie likes straw-berry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Do you really have something to do this week end ? " " Just by chance , " he said , walking out . One full-leafed elm fronted the apartment house . The light of the street lamp sieved through the branches throwing a tessellated pattern on the ground . Leaving the apartment house during the summer evenings , Jonas would take the few extra steps that wouldp102take him into that dark mosaic . It gave him a feeling of displacement . He imagined himself in a foreign country  --  probably the residue of a movie scene where two lovers or conspirators met beneath a Hollywood tree in imaginary London . As he continued on toward the corner , the image of Ruth swung around in his mind like a lighthouse beacon . He felt the nervous crawling in his stomach . That part of him still wanting its freedom cried out in protest against the tyrannous imposition of this one person . It was too sudden . He had n't had the time to prepare himself for this pre-emption . The thoroughness of the invasion left him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work wearing the lightest suit he had , which was still not a summer suit . ( Who wore special suits for summer ? Summer was a time to put all suits in mothproof bags . ) The lunch he had with Ruth was a gradual inundation of discomforts . The restaurant he had carefully chosen beforehand was airconditioned , all right , as advertised , but after the first icy shock his body beneath its woolen jacket broke out into a clammy sweat more oppressive than a four-o'clock sun on a humid day . Then his hands , which a combination of Gre-Solvent and cleaning fluid had n't rid of their pore-deep , cuticle-stained composition of dirt and ink . Then his suit , which released from time to time the camphor vapors trapped in its weave . He had n't enjoyed that lunch at all . He had been too conscious of too many things . The time , the menu , other people , the swaddling suffocation of his clothes . Ruth seemed in no mood to propitiate the situation . She said it was foolish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . She was sorry . She should have known better . And he had spent the time assuring her that it was all right , that he had looked forward to this very much since last Wednesday , and if she had n't shown up he would have been  --  well , " disappointed " was the least word he could think of . He assumed her real regret was having made this arrangement in the first place , and he was so completely in sympathy with such a feeling that he practically sterilized his words against the slightest suspicion of intimacy . They had met , say , by accident , on the street .... " Oh , hello . What are you doing here ? Having lunch ?  |p103May  I join you ? " . . . Happens all the time . People meet . Friends . Acquaintances . ... " Alex , I met that young friend of Ira 's , Jonas Gould , and we had lunch together . " . . . " Did you now ? And what sort of a young fellow is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , just a big kid . I felt sorry for him . " . . . And when they had left the restaurant ( the natural warmth of the sun a blessed relief after the hellish refrigeration of the place ) , he had looked at his wrist watch . Seeing him do that , Ruth had put out her hand and said , " Good-by , Jonas , " with an air of such self-reproach that a bubble of sweetness rose , burst , and washed the lining of his nose and throat . He knew then that what Ruth regretted was not having met him , but having that meeting come to so little . He must , therefore , for all his discomforts and anxiety to be back to work on time , share her regret or be guilty of a callousness that she would never forgive and he would never forget . " I 'm sorry , " he had said , taking her hand . " There was n't enough time . That was badly planned . " At this Ruth looked up at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tentativeness , this incipience , grew suddenly older and more entrenched . " Do n't be silly , " she said . " You do n't have to plan anything . " They agreed to meet in the city that Wednesday evening . Ruth said nothing of Alex . She did n't explain her freedom . Why should he ask ? They went to a movie on Wednesday , to a west-side Loew 's , where they saw Wuthering Heights . Ruth shed movie tears at the aching poignance . As they left their seats after seeing the film through , Ruth whispered , " Wait , " as they came to the back wall of the theatre . She wished to stand there for five minutes more of that beautiful , somber-eyed Olivier moodiness . While they had sat side by side , he had taken her hand , or somehow their hands had met , but he had released hers soon after , embarrassed at the sweatiness of their contact . Now , standing behind her , he was drawn into contactagain touching her body with his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed her hand over his , pressing the flat of his hand against her side . He felt the pendulous curve and weight of herp104breast . Blood flooded his groin . Neither prayer nor will could stay that tumescence . So he moved away , and Ruth , sensing his reason , or perhaps having already felt it , turned as one refusing a deprivationand with one hand on his shoulder drew him down to her lips . Deliberately she moved into that immitigable zone , and there was nothing for Jonas to do but accept his condition , as she accepted it ; and through the grace of her acceptance , he was granted for the first time in his life a freedom from that embarrassment . It was not an embarrassment God had thrust upon man , not something to be wished away ; rather something whose existence could be acknowledgedand shared without shame . True ! Wonderful ! . . . But that , apparently , was where the sharingended , because as Ruth separated from him and moved toward the exit , she did n't pause once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that unreduced existence . So he put his hand in his pocket and managed as painfully best he could . In the lobby Ruth turned to him and smiled an amused , knowing smile . She knew , for the sweet love of God ! He shook his head and grinned . He was in a delirium of discovery ! And then ? What would a man do ? Would a man know which hotel to phone , what voice to use to secure a room without questions , without baggage ? Perhaps a man would . Jonas did n't . " I must go now , " Ruth said . " Are you going to see me again ? " " Tomorrow ? " he asked . Ruth shook her head . " Not tomorrow . " Well , then , when ? Saturday ? No . Sunday ? Yes , Sunday . She could see him Sunday , if he wished . Alex , what do you do on Sunday ? Do n't you sleep late , read the papers , have a leisurely breakfast of scrambled eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Park Zoo where the camel stands all shredded and goofy and the smell of assorted animal shit is politely disregarded by all but kids too young not to hold their noses when they smell something bad ? . . . And what kind of mistake was being made here ? And who was making it ? The day was as bright as polished brass , and the street was as empty as only a Manhattan street can be on a Sunday in mid-July.  |p105The  Fortieth Street side of the public library seemed to Jonas to be the very dead heart of dead city . Here were stones eminently suited for labeling , this wall enclosing the library . They would contain forever his mood of disbelief and anonymity . He could not completelycredit his presence here . He was , say , at the handball court seeing himself here , and there was a headshaking wonder at the sight of him walking up and down , the only living soul on this stricken street . It was eleven o'clock and blazing hot . He felt foolish , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could not quite catch and convulse the muscles of his throat and jaw . It brought tears to his eyes . Then Ruth appeared at the corner . She was wearing a print dress . He walked to meet her . It was all not to be believed until she was there , and then it made no more sense but it was all right . " Where shall we go ? " he asked . " I do n't know , " she said . " Anywhere . " " I wish I had a car , " he said . " We can take a bus , " she suggested . " Or a subway . " " To where ? " " To wherever you want to go " These words released him from the prohibition he had imposed upon himself , and they took the subway far uptown , even farther than he had to go , two stations beyond . The impulse Jonas followed was reasonless and clear . It took him through that same schoolyard from which he had seen himself patrolling the emptiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whaling away with sweaty abandon . The sun ignited the mica in the concrete . " Is this where you play handball ? " Ruth asked . " Yes , " he replied . She was silent , and Jonas recalled telling her that he occasionally met Ira here . He became suddenly wide-eyed at his folly . Suppose Ira were to appear ? How would he explain ? How would Ruth explain ? Crazy ! A trap ! He guided Ruth quickly out of the schoolyard . " I live near here , " he said , as they walked along the broad , treelinedstreet where old people reclined in canvas chairs and husbands gave their wives driving lessons . " Is that where you 're going ? " she asked . " Do you want to go there ? " he asked  |p106Jesus  ! What a gutless bastard ! Asking TIER ! " Is n't your family at home ? " she asked . " No , my sister 's gone for the week end , " he explained . " She wo n't be coming back until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city with a buddy of his . Then he 's going to have dinner at this man 's house . Kramer . Funny . My father really hates the man , but he ca n't beat him at chess . That 's the basis of their friendship . I believe that friendship would end with my father 's first checkmate , but so far he has n't been able to beat him . " ( This was much better . To talk about Solomon . Then to talk about Debbie . Father and sister appeared like green , wooded hill country after a long stretch of open desert . Something to look at . A place to hide . ) " Actually , " he went on , " my father has n't had many friends in his life . I do n't know why . IIe 's a very intelligent man , wellinformed , but he 's got some awfully curious ideas about people . He gets disappointed very quickly . Maybe that 's why he 's been able to get along with Kramer for so long . Kramer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin with . Except for chess . Talky and facile , Jonas turned in at the apartment house . There was no one around . And if there were ? He was only talking . He and this friend ( who happened to be a female ) were just talking , as people will , and since they were passing the apartment where he happened to live , they decided to drop in and say hello . To whom ? Well , to whomever happened to be at home . How would you , or you , or you , know that there was no one at home ? The hall was dim with its usual dimness , and pee-tinctured , and cool . The coolness penetrated Jonas 's flesh . Still he talked ; talked the key into the lock ; talked himself and Ruth into the apartment ; and in the foyer , as though in mercy to stop his talking , Ruth put her arms around him and pressed her body against his panic . Jonas bent toward her , resting his cheek upon her hair . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He clung to Ruth for safety , breathed in only her hair to obscure whatever familiarity might come to him : appleblossom , furniture oil , soap . But he could n't stay like that forever . He lifted his head , and it all hit him . What was Ruth Miller-Klein doing here ? By what witchcraft hadp107she been transported from where she belonged to this sacred corner ? She was an interloper . What would Debbie think ? What would Debbie say ? . . . What Debbie ? Where Debbie ? " Ruth  --  " " Yes ? " " What shall I do ? " " Kiss me , " she said . Not during but afterward he looked at her body . After all the years of rumor and puzzlement , he had kept his eyes fixed only on her face , knowing that to look elsewhere might bring on a humiliation . He needed her face for a decent measure of control . There had been too many faceless bodies in his dreams . Her body would be his intemperance . Her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to siphon away some of the blood-throb that threatened to explode him into shame . Even when she stood before him ( he sitting on the opened sofa ) , he would not look but embracedher ; and while his hands and the circle of his arms took in these final , true dimensions , his mind remained fastened on her eyes for the saving alloy he found in them . That was why , he later realized , it had been good . That 's why her mouth had sobbed so rackingly against his . Afraid he had done her some harm , he made a move , but her arms held him . She shook her head , silently commanding him not to stir , not to speak , not to do anything but remain where he was until she was ready to release him . Jonas Gould felt himself knighted . He buried his unseemly grin into the pillow . Then he could study Ruth 's body , and he learned that all his imaginings had been a child 's conception of a royal feast . How was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had imagined one thing , he had left out another . The miracle was in the completion . There was no lust in his looking ; only a desire to take in and hold forever the knowledge of this symmetry . When he returned at last to her face , he found it touched by a wise , smiling complicity . " What ? " he said.  | " Do you like me ? " she asked . " I like you . " " Have you ever seen a woman before ? " " No . " " Do you think my body is nice ? " " I think your body is perfect . " " How would you know ? " " I know . " Ruth raised herself and leaned over him . She kissed him  --  eyes , lips , body  --  slowly and solemnly , as if performing a scarament . Then she rested her head on his chest . " Do you know how old I am ? " she asked . " No . " " I 'm your sister 's age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion of limits and proprieties . His few exploits with Chink Adler 's courtesans had been more in the nature of a petty crime , clumsily committed in darkness , and with partners who lent themselves to the act as mere accomplices . It was victory enough to have dared and done . The desire to be away from the scene was strong in him even before the last spasm had died away . Every instinct cried out against lingering . Languor was as inconceivableas love . But with Ruth he passed from depletion to somnolence to a powerful renewal , and he was sure this was greed and grossness , sheer animality . He even tried to conceal his condition , again , but Ruth made the discovery  --  and he made the discovery that the look of animality quickly disappears when appetites are shared . Within three hours they had shared three times , and then Jonas awakened to the sudden demand of another appetite . " I 'm hungry , " he announced . Ruth laughed and kissed him and said they must do something about that immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would satisfy all hungers . The caution he had felt on entering the apartment house had completely disappeared when he left it . Something else had taken itsp109place . A curiosity . This curiosity had begun in the house , after they had dressed , and he had watched Ruth apply cosmetics to her face with quick , sure fingers . Lipstick , powder , rouge , all handled with personal style and feminine magic . She had allowed him to watch , seemed , even , to enjoy his watching , while he had looked on in a kind of chambered delight . Then Ruth had prepared scrambled eggs , toast , and coffee . She moved briskly , efficiently , handling these kitchen utensils with a familiarity that seemed to say : a frying pan is a frying pan  --  yours , mine , what difference ? Again Jonas was drawn to her face , looking for  --  what ? He was n't sure . Something . A stigma of some sort , perhaps ; a telltale sign . This search continued during the impromptu meal Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and walked out into a street that clamped them in a vise of brilliance and heat . They walked toward the subway , each withdrawn into silence . With these houses and trees all about , the landscape of his days , Jonas felt it more strongly , this expectancy , this curiosity , this paradox . For here was Ruth Miller-Klein , the wife of another man , walking in her summer dress ( the one she had slipped over her head only a few hours ago ) as if nothing had happened . Her mouth gave no evidence of having been kissed , of having kissed . The distinctive line from cheekbone to chin remained unaltered . Her hair was as black as before , giving off a siliceous glitter under the fierce sun . Her silence covered like an ocean the sighs and cries that passion had wrung from her so short a time ago . What did it mean ? There was a meaning here , and it set up a deep-seated itch in Jonas 's consciousnessthat tickled and tickled but could not be reached for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke softly but not furtively . " I hope I can trust you , " she said . " Please do n't talk about this . I know men love to boast , but please do n't talk about it . To anyone . Not even Ira . Will you promise ? " " What do you think I am ? " Jonas protested . " I know what you are , " she said with a smile . " Male . Promise me . Jonas promised . " Someday , " she said , " I 'll tell you more , but right now all I can sayp110is that I do n't want to hurt Alex . Do you understand that ? " Jonas wondered if she was just being careless with her words , or if she really thought him an imbecile . " No , I do n't understand that , " he said blankly . " You must remember I 'm a very young man . But I 'm a willing learner , and I promise to listen and to do what I 'm told . " Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . " Do n't be angry , " she said . " You 're sweet . Now listen ... " Jonas listened as Ruth told him how and when and where they could go on seeing each other . There were certain evenings of the week when Alex was occupied with work that he did at home , and then they could meet anywhere in the city . To walk . To talk . To see a movie . To do whatever they wished , according to the convenience of time and place . There were other times  --  much less frequent  --  when Alex went to Rochester for as much as three or four days at a time . On business . A company manufacturing small electrical appliances employed Alex on a part-time basis to design their various cataloguesand advertising flyers . It was what Alex called " shlak " work , but it paid well . . . . Jonas glanced at Ruth to see what expression would accompany this explanation , and he found the serious demeanorof a wife who appreciated and knew what value to ascribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confounding . " Where 's Alex today ? " Jonas could n't resist asking . " Visiting his parents , " Ruth replied . " Sometimes I go with him . Sometimes not . I find it very depressing . Alex understands . " Ruth thought it best that they should part at Grand Central . Jonas went with her into the station , whose vaulted enormity seemed about to collapse upon itself for want of its normal pressure of noise and movement . Ruth knew a labyrinth of passageways . She stopped at last at a flight of steps . " Wednesday ? " she asked . " Yes , " said Jonas . " Do n't you dare look at another woman , " she warned , and walked up the steps , leaving him there.  |p111Jonas  turned and began to walk back in the general direction of the subway . Where was he going now ? Home . Of course . Where else ? ... " Do n't you dare look at another woman . " . . . He smiled . The smile enlarged into a grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell like a drop of attar on his enchanted senses , covering them with a thin , fragrant , containing film.  |p112During  the summer months , Ackerman Artcraft was officially closed on Saturday . Closed but open . Leo Ackerman came in . He valued these Saturdays . They gave him a chance to sit and ponder without the petty disturbances and personality clashes that consumed the work week . He could make decisions on Saturday . He had left it with Jonas that the door was open on Saturday . Naturally , it being summer , he understood that people , especially young ones , wanted their week ends ; but if an ambitious fellow wanted to earn a little overtime , learn a little something about the printing business  --  well , the door was open . No obligation . Jonas by this time understood his boss well enough to know that the suggestion carried no veiled injunction . If he had no week-end plans , and he felt like it , he could come in . If not , he expected no sour looks on Monday . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , Jonas found Mr. Ackerman sitting behind his desk , as usual . He paused to say , " Good morning , " and then proceeded into the shop to change his clothes . On reflection , it seemed to him that Mr. Ackerman was n't looking well . His face had the pallor and lumpiness of unbaked dough . " Jonas ! " called Mr. Ackerman . Jonas walked back into the office . Mr. Ackerman was sitting swiveled around in his chair , looking out the dusty window , one hand over his swollen belly . " What the hell are you doing here ? " Mr. Ackerman asked . " I thought I 'd work on the American Book order , " Jonas said , and added , " But I can leave . " " I 'm not feeling well , " Mr. Ackerman said . His chair **26;7736;TOOLONG as he turned around in it . " I think I 'll have to go home . I 'm sorry you came in . " " That 's all right , " Jonas said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular ? " " Stomach , " Mr. Ackerman replied , patting that afflicted area . He sucked in air and grimaced . " You would think God knows what I ate to be cursed with the miserable gut . You know what I eat ? I 'll tell you what I eat : I eat graham crackers and milk , that 's what I eat ! " Jonas thought of the club sandwiches Mr. Ackerman occasionally had sent up from the delicatessen : small loaves of bread sliced horizontally with tassels of spiced meat hanging from their packed middles . His diet was not graham crackers and milk ; they were his penance . Mr. Ackerman regarded Jonas with a dyspeptic look , but floating somewhere in all that self-concern was a challenge . Jonas sensed it , knew that it had to do with " attractive " Roslyn , the daughter who was to have been home from college in June . He wondered  --  and not for the first time  --  whether Mr. Ackerman expected him to bring up the subject again , to show some eagerness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly not now , heaped as his memory was with the fabulous riches of Ruth . He had been thankful that so much time had slipped by with no mention of Roslyn . He could n't imagine that any girl with the slightest pride would consent to that kind of arrangement , and with each passing week he had felt , remotely , an increasing respect for Roslyn Ackerman . Still , he was sure that Leo Ackerman 's fleeting appraisals were a comment on his lack of initiative . " Look , Mr. Ackerman , " Jonas said , " I can get dressed right now and go home . I hope you do n't feel you have to hang around becauseof me . I mean , if you 're not feeling well ... " " You came in to do some work , " Mr. Ackerman said . " You do n't have to go home because of me . I can give you the key . You can close the shop when you 're through . As a matter of fact , I think you ought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but who says he ca n't get sick , too . The two of us can get sick . Here , I 've got some extra ones  --  " Mr. Ackerman hauled out of his pocket a batch of keys , detached two , and chucked them across the desk . " Do n't losep114them , " he cautioned . " Get yourself a good key ring and a chain . Like this one . You have responsibilities now . If you ask me that 's what you need more of  --  responsibility . " Jonas smiled . " I appreciate the trust , Mr. Ackerman . Does a raise go along with it ? " Leo Ackerman consulted the ceiling , shaking his head slowly . " What have you done to deserve a raise ? " he asked . " Worked hard , " Jonas replied promptly . " Learned more about printing . Made myself more useful . " " Then I 'll give you a raise , " Mr. Ackerman said . " How much ? " Jonas smiled . " I do n't think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyebrows . " Why should n't it be for you to say ? " he asked . " You think you deserve a raise , you must have an idea how much . Modesty is not one of your troubles , whatever else is . So give me an idea . Twenty dollars a week ? " " I was n't expecting anything like that , " Jonas said . " You were n't ? But you were expecting something . " " I hoped . " " You have n't even worked a year yet . Why did you hope ? " " Mr. Ackerman , you ca n't measure value by time , " Jonas said . Leo Ackerman came as near to a smile as he ever permitted himself . " You 'll get a raise , " he said . " Thank you for leaving it to me . Ihope you wo n't be disappointed . " He drew back a little from thedesk and opened the middle drawer , from which he withdrew afolded card . He propped it on the desk . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A greeting card , " he answered . " Do you have any idea how many of those are sold every year ? " Mr. Ackerman asked . " Lots , " said Jonas . " Millions , " specified Mr. Ackerman . " Tens of millions . Read it . " Jonas read it . It was a Mother 's Day card with the usual sentiment . " Is that high-class poetry , or is n't it ? " Mr. Ackerman asked . " Lovely , " Jonas said , replacing the card on the desk . " What the hell do you know about poetry ? " " Nothing . "  | " I showed it to my daughter , and she thought she 'd vomit . What 's wrong with it ? " " Well , I do n't think anything is wrong with it , " Jonas said . " I mean that 's the sort of stuff they print on those cards , is n't it ? " " You 're asking me ? I 'm asking you ! " " My answer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ackerman insisted . " No , it is n't good poetry , " Jonas answered . " It 's  --  it 's  --  " " It 's , it 's . . . it 's what ? " " It 's good for what it 's supposed to be . " " You mean a million slobs would piss buttermilk when they read it . " " I guess . " " Glad to hear it , " said Mr. Ackerman , looking satisfied . " Personally , I find nothing wrong with it as poetry . I think it 's a very tender and well-expressed sentiment , even if I wrote it myself . " " Did you ? " Jonas asked , astonished . " Why , does n't it sound like me ? " Jonas at last got his bearings . Leo Ackerman was having a little private amusement at Jonas Gould 's expense . " No , it does n't , Mr. Ackerman , " Jonas replied . " If you 'll forgive me for saying so , it sure as hell does n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now , listen , you cockamamie  --  there's a business , right there in front of you . That card . There 's machinery , labor , bookkeeping , a plant , loans from a bank , inventory , pay roll , profit  --  right there in that card . I 'm going into that business , Jonas . What did you think was in those envelopes you went around collecting ? " " I had no idea . " " Are you telling me you never looked ? Some of those envelopes were n't sealed . " " I never looked , " Jonas said . " You 're lying . " " I swear it . " " Why did n't you look ? " Mr. Ackerman wanted to know . " How can you learn about a business if you do n't take a peek once in a while ?  |p116All  right , never mind , I 'll tell you what was in those envelopes . Poetry . What you just read there . That kind of shit . I got spinsters , retired schoolteachers , unemployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're all writing poetry to make an extra buck . If I like it , I pay . If I do n't , I send it back . Those I pay , I encourage to write more . For all kinds of occasions : Mother 's Day ; birthdays ; graduation ; Christmas . . . you name it . " Jonas said , " Not that I minded , Mr. Ackerman , but why did I have to pick them up ? Why could n't they just mail them to you ? " " Because I did n't want Mrs. Green and Miss Cohen and Miss Vitelli opening up those envelopes and asking a lot of questions . That 's why . And I did n't want them mailed to my house , because who knows what kind of maniacs there are in the city . Some disappointedcrackpot is liable to come to my house and shoot me because I turned down his masterpiece . Do n't you know what goes on in this city ? What I did , I advertised in the Times , in some magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Name and address only , if they thought they could write poetry for greeting cards . I wanted to find out who I was dealing with . I had them write to the box number when they had anything ready , and then I sent you . See ? Now you know . And listen , I want you to continue to keep tabs on these people . Now that you know what 's it all about , I want you to get an idea how old they are , whether they look sane or not , things like that . Someday I may want to hire them on a full-time basis . " " When are you going to start ? " Jonas asked . Mr. Ackerman gazed at Jonas distractedly . His face contorted , and he tried several times to relieve himself with a belch . Then he brought his fingers to his lips and pantomimed the turning of a key . " Locked , " he said adjuringly . " Understand ? Not a word . To anyone . Not even to your own family . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less , but I do n't want you to breathe a word of this . When will I start ? When I have the necessary facilities , and the people I can trust . I do n't know when . Maybe six months , maybe a year . I do n't want to manufacture here . I want a different location , a different company . Most of all , I 'll need somebody I can trust . Do I make myself clear ? "  | " Perfectly , " said Jonas . " All right . . . . Incidentally , Jonas , are you a cretin ? " " A what ? " " I told my daughter I 'd like her to meet a nice young man , and she said if the recommendation came from me he must be a cretin . Nice ? That 's education . A fine thing , education . It gives a young person finesse , a broader vocabulary to make her parents ' lives miserable with . . . . She went to a ranch , my daughter . A ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a thing ? A girl grows up in the city , knows nothing but cars her whole life , and she falls in love with horses . . . . Jonas , I 'm going home . I 've got a fire in my stomach . " Mr. Ackerman , despite his burning stomach , carefully went over the locking of the door with Jonas . Three times . He impressed upon Jonas the necessity to secure both locks , top and bottom . Satisfied , he left . Jonas returned to the shop and finished the work he had come in to do . At eleven , he washed , changed clothes , and walked into Mr. Ackerman 's office . Odd that the man did n't have a photograph of his wife or daughter in evidence . Maybe he kept it in a drawer . Jonas sat down in Leo Ackerman 's swivel chair . He opened the middle drawer . No photo . There were more drawers on either side . Jonas hesitated .. .. " How can you learn about a business if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Jonas began opening drawers and found nothing but old papers and old castings . In the last drawer on the right , beneath a stack of trade magazines , Jonas found several Manila envelopes , their flaps closed with little red strings . He took them out . Inside were glossy prints . Nudes . There was no mock art about these poses , no coy profiles and concealing hands . It was straight sex . The girls cupped their breasts and offered them to the viewer like ripe melons . They lay on beds and spraddled chairs . All of them wore that one lacy black thing fashioned by a genius of lechery . Jonas 's response was automatic , but the rise quickly died away . He thought of Leo Ackerman , that clever , not ungenerous , man , who had trapped his lusts in a hopeless prison of a body , still hun/gering , wheedling crumbs from a delivery boy , keeping girlie photos buried in his desk . Jonas could guess what that hunger must be  --  having so recently fed to satiety  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprising Mr. Ackerman.  |p119The  East Coast climate took its place on the front pages of newspapers along with new threats in Europe and new threats in Asia . Temperatures in the mid-eighties were commonplace , and each week could boast of at least one record in the nineties . There was drought . Roosevelt instituted emergency measures . Older people succumbed . Salt tablets were recommended . The World 's Fair attendance dropped . A combination **36;7764;TOOLONG was offered to entice visitors . Jonas met Ruth one Sunday at the Russian Pavilion . " How exciting it must be , " she said . " What ? " he asked . " Tractors ? " " Oh , God , Jonas ! " " Tell me , what 's exciting ? " he asked . " To be part of it , " Ruth replied . " A true people 's democracy . " " What would you do there ? " he wanted to know , genuinely curious . " Act , " she said . " An actress in the Soviet Union acts . It 's an art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do your job well , and then you do it . For the people , not a handful of rich who can afford tickets . They really bring theatre to the people over there . The Stanislayski  --  " " The what ? " " Jonas , please do n't tell me that you 've never heard of Stanislav-ski ! " " Is this the end ? " he asked . " I ca n't believe it ! " Ruth exclaimed . " How do you manage to know so little ? What have you been doing your whole life ? " " Tell me about Stanislayski. "  |p120Ruth  told him about Stanislayski . There was always some informationfor Ruth to impart . That was the custom that had quickly evolved from their meetings , not merely because Ruth was older and had learned much about things Jonas had scarcely heard of , but because they had each instinctively felt their way toward such an accommodation . Jonas pretended more naivete than was real , seeingwith what joy Ruth fell upon this fallowness and seeded it . She pretended to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like pleasure . There was a voluptuous reversal in this . The edge of superiority she assumed ( and which Jonas allowed her to assume ) in their talk made her sexual surrenders all the more dramatic and satisfying . Jonas sensed the truth of this without ever stating it to himself . He became a willing part of the play because there was just as much pleasure in it for him . Ruth allowed him to feel a greater mastery . " What time do you have to be home ? " Jonas asked her . " Any time before midnight , " she said . " And you ? " " Me ? I 'm a grown man . I 'm home when I 'm home . " " How nice . What shall we do ? " " Make love , " he said jokingly . " Where ? " Ruth asked promptly . Jonas shook his head incredulously . " I thought somebody might be in Rochester , " he said . He could not bring himself to utter Alex 's name aloud any longer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then , deliberately , she asked again , " Where ? " " Well , I guess nowhere , " he said . " My , my ! " " Am I being unimaginative ? " he asked . " Unsomething " Jonas sighed and shook his head . He could not absorb it fully . Not even now . Not even after the three unhesitating demonstrations of her eagerness , each one at the Gould apartment , on successive Sundays . ( Alex , what the hell do you do with your Sundays ? Where are you ? ) That she should wish it as much as he did was a marvel that plucked at him , made him vibrate with all kinds of hidden chords : pride ; astonishment ; immorality ; deliciousness ; apprehension ; ap121topsy-turviness that set up a terrific jangle and made him at times come frighteningly close to one of his idiotic giggles . " I do n't know when someone might be walking in today , " he told her . " There 's Edward G. Robinson , " Ruth said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . A short man with a round face looking rather pale and self-effacing . " A lot of his paintings are being shown at the art exhibit , " Ruth explained . The actor walked briskly across the grounds . Then Ruth said ; " Does it have to be there ? " " No , of course not , " Jonas said . " But where ? " " Oh , Jonas . " " A hotel ? " " I 've heard of such things , " Ruth said . For the love of God ! For Pete 's sake ! What the hell ! After ALL ! " But which hotel ? " " How should I know ? Is n't that for the man to find out ? " " All right , " he said . " I 'll find out . " " When ? " Jonas was staggered . " Do you mean today ? " Ruth shrugged . Jonas took her arm . The soft inside flesh transmittedimperative messages . Where ? Where ? How was it possible ? Without a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say , " Double room , buddy . " And wink ? Surely there must be hundreds of such hotels . But where ? Their names ? " Someone I knew was once having an affair  --  " Ruth said . Jonas phoned the hotel whose name Ruth gave him . He began along complicated story about being from out of town , Hartford , visiting the Fair , and his car broke down , a cracked cylinder .. . " Single or double ? " the clerk asked . " Ah  --  double . " " One night ? " " Yes . " " We got a room . " " The name is Gould , " Jonas said . " Jonas Gould . " " Okay . " They went . The clerk asked for payment in advance . Five dollars . The room was small and stifling , a perfect place to combine sin andp122expiation . Jonas was ashamed of the sweat and smell of his body . He was nervous , hasty , fumbling . There was n't even a shower in the miserable hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonas kissed her face and discovered that tears , too , had an odor . " Let 's get out of here , " he implored . " Please ! " They dressed and left . They walked over to Broadway , then south , unspeaking . Jonas felt soiled with sordidness , and he was sure he would never see Ruth again . But it was not his idea that they go to that lousy hotel ! He would have been perfectly willing to spend this Sunday in the only way that seemed feasible , but she had insisted , insisted and goaded him into that horrible , sweaty disappointment . " Why do n't we take a double-decker ? " he suggested . " Get some breeze . " Ruth nodded . They waited at a bus stop for an open-deck bus . When it came , Ruth stepped up and mounted the steps to the upper tier without glancing behind . Jonas had to pause and have two dimes snatched from his fingers by the conductor 's prehensile little machine . Then he followed . The rushing movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where Ruth was sitting , and as he made to slide in beside her she turned her shadowed face toward him . Loss , like a falling ball of iron , thudded in his bowels . He felt sick . He could have cried out his pain . " I 'm sorry , " he said . Ruth leaned toward him and kissed him , heedless of the people behind . " There 's nothing to be sorry about , " she said , whispering her words against the flow of air . " I love you . Do n't you know that ? " Yes , he knew that , and he was sure that what he felt was the same . But he could n't bring himself to say the word . He took her hand , squeezed it , covered it with his other hand , but he could n't bring himself to say the word . He had never said " love " to another human being , and he was seized with a fear of committing all he did n't know about Jonas Gould to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought about changes . Jonas had moved into a different atmosphere , one having nothing to do with changes of season . For the same uncertain motives that he had examined Ruth 's face , Jonas began to examine his own : to see what transformation had come about ; to see what was there that might account for all of this . Nothing . At least nothing that he could discover . The same blue-gray eyes . The same **26;7802;TOOLONG . The same sievelike brain . Perhaps it was sheer accident ; the accident of meeting Ira , and all that had ensued from that . Or perhaps it was something he could n't see ; a subcutaneous ripeness , such as women sniff through the skins of cantaloupes . But even a ripe Jonas fell measurably short of anything Jonas would consider exceptional . His innocence was a guise . His ignorance was partly a dissimulation . All the ideas coming to him from Ruth and Ira were not exactly a revelation . He had heard them all before , had read of them , and the faultiness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His dreamy inattention . He was finding sufficiency in sensation  --  warmth , cold , pleasure , anticipation , memory . Whatever portion of his mind he gave over to active thought was enough to get him through his days . He had managed to learn a good deal about printing without disturbing the essential idleness of his mind . Probably he would have continued that way but for the contempt he was beginning to feel for the big , easy , child-of-nature image he gave . It did n't suit him . He had fallen into the role easily enough , and perhaps he was the only one who knew that it had only been a pose , a strategic maneuver , one designed to get him through a period in which he knew himself to be at a disadvantage . But the idea of permanent junior status did n't please him at all . It was true that he had n't made contact with any deep intuitionof personal worth , but the pride he took in others disallowed a posture of inferiority . Jonas Gould was what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brother . As if responding to a challenge he himself had issued , Jonas began to investigate the sandy wastes of his mind , where countless bits ofp124information had dropped and been covered over , never to take root . Reading the daily newspaper , for instance . Surely there was nothing so difficult there that he could n't , if he really applied himself , become as well-informed as Norman B. Prager . It was simply a matter of paying attention . He began to pay attention . He looked to see exactly where Danzig was . He pinned its locationin his brain like a marker on a campaign map , so that in the future when anybody mentioned that place it would not wander around the northern part of Europe like a floating dock . There it was , on the Baltic , and it was easy to see why it was causing so much trouble . He followed the frantic discussions going on between London , Berlin , Paris , Rome , Moscow , and Warsaw , and it seemed to him that specifics only strengthened the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Hitler wanted war . Hitler would have war . Nothing could stop him . The same blood instinct which informed any schoolboy of the imminence of a fist fight operated at the level of frightful armies . It had nothing to do with rights or wrongs . Hitler had thinned the air of the world to that unbearable rarity which precedes and precipitates the moment of violence . Even if he got what he claimed he wanted , he would still make war . Abasement and appeasement would only infuriatehim . He did n't want territories or apologies . He wanted war . But these were facts long known to Jonas . His quest was for the kind of information whose very appearance in the headlines had the effect of paralyzing his brain . Like : TVA TAKES TITLE TO POWER FOR STATE OF TENNESSEE ; $78,000,000 PAID WILLKLE . He had only to lookat words like these and a thick leathery curtain , like a lizard 's lid , slowly shut out all light . What " title " ? What " power " ? Who was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read with forced attention , as though studying for an exam . It was atrociously dull , but he read . It went on and on , and he reread whole paragraphs instead of letting them slip by , as he usually did , out of boredom . Gradually a meaning began to emerge . The Federal government 's acquisition of Commonwealth and Southern 's subsidiaryin Tennessee had not taken place solely to produce a soporific buzz in Jonas Gould 's head . Giant things were at stake . Dams and soil reclamation and a precedent that shook the founda/tions of private enterprise . Coherence shaped itself . He understood . The government was buying power stations and miles of cable and all sorts of equipment for a very large sum of money . It would manufacture electricity in Tennessee at low rates . That 's what it was all about . The pressure Jonas had applied to himself had condensed the usual vapors into a shining drop of comprehension . . . . Naturally , he could n't keep something like that to himself . " Maybe we 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked at the kitchen table that evening , as Debbie served one of her hot-weather meals of sour cream and diced cucumbers and radishes . Solomon and Debbie looked at him . " I mean , " he explained , " now that the TVA has taken over in Tennessee . " " Solomon and Debbie looked at each other . Debbie spoke . " I saw something about it in the paper today . " " Did n't you read about it , Pa ? " Jonas asked Solomon . " Only the headline , " Solomon answered . " So let 's hear about the Socialist millennium . " Jonas doled out the facts , astonished at how much he had retained . As he spoke , he served himself another helping from the bowl of diced vegetables . Debbie moved the bowl closer to him for convenience , then offered the bowl to Solomon , who took it with a nod . There was in the play of hands and in the silence that attended his recital a barely perceived pattern , delicate and flawed , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its weakness . Having become aware of it , Jonas could trace its beginningsto an earlier point in the evening , perhaps as early as his entrance into the apartment . The stress seemed to be between Solomon and Debbie , with himself as the locus of converging lines . He ended his TVA story abruptly . " I did n't know you were such a student of current events , " Solomon observed . " I think we 're seeing a new Jonas , " Debbie said . " What 's happen-ing ? " " With me ? Nothing . " " Oh-h , I do n't know about that , " Debbie said , half-playful , half/serious . " You 're out much more than you used to be . You seem to have new interests . Is there a girl , Jonas ? " " Several , " he said . " All gorgeous . All rich . " " Forgive me for prying . " " How 's Norman ? " Jonas asked . " I have n't seen him recently . " " You 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner he'sinvited you to , " Debbie said . " At his home  --  his parents ' home  --  inBrooklyn . " " Just me ? " Jonas wanted to know . " Is n't Pa invited ? " " Of course Pa is invited . " " Sort of a family get-together ? " Jonas queried . " Sort of , " Debbie replied . " I ca n't say no to that , can I ? " " It would make me unhappy if you did , " Debbie said . " But you can say no . You ca n't be forced to accept a person or a situation if you do n't want to . " " Saturday , " Jonas said . " That 's your birthday , is n't it ? " " Yes . " " And is this supposed to be a birthday party ? " Jonas asked . " Partly . " " What 's the other part , a sort of engagement ? " " You could say that . " " Why do I have to say everything ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going to do , go right through the window ? Congratulations . " " Thank you . I hope you mean it . " " Debbie , answer one thing , and then you wo n't hear another word from me . Okay ? " " I 'll try . " " Do you love Norman ? " " Very much . " Jonas rubbed his hands together . " Well , " he said , " what 's for dessert ? " He felt as though his heart were in his hands , and his hands were coated with sand . " Watermelon , " Debbie said . " You knew about this , did n't you ? " Jonas said , addressing his father . " I mean before I started with the TVA business ? "  | " I knew , " Solomon said . " So what was that whole farce supposed to be , special handling for the insane ? " He turned to Debbie with a bland lightness . " You 're a big girl , Deb . You marry who you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I do n't understand you . " " I know that , Jonas , " she said . " Oh , you know that . I guess you think I 'm pretty stupid . " " I do n't think you 're stupid at all , " Debbie said , prepared to bend in whatever direction the wind would blow . " Well , as a matter of fact , I am pretty thick , " Jonas said rapidly . " I just ca n't get it through my head . Why do you want to marry Norman ? Give me one good reason , and I 'll really shut up . For all eternity . " " We 're the same kind of people , " Debbie said softly . " Who 's the same kind of people ? " Jonas demanded , just as softly . " You and Norman ? Would you explain to me in just what way you 're the same ? It really escapes me . " " Jonas , I want you to stop this , " Solomon put in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know this is painful , but I think it 's time we talked about it . " " Debbie , please get it out of your head that it 's so painful , " Jonas said . " It is n't  --  I do n't  --  I 'm not trying to prevent you from marrying Norman . I 'm just trying to understand it . Norman to me is a small man . I do n't mean in height . There 've been great men who were small . .. . " I 'm a small person , too , " Debbie said . " All I 've ever done is take care of both of you . Did you think that was preparation for greatness ? Not that I minded . I did n't . But it was you , Pa , and you , Jonas , who thought there was something special in it . I never saw anything special in it . All it ever meant to me was more work than most girls my age had to do . And I did n't mind that either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I was no fairy princess in the scullery . I happen to be a very practical person . I do n't know how we would have gotten along if I were n't . Jonas , you ask in what way Norman and I are the same . I 'll tell you : we 're both very practical people . " Now Solomon shifted in his chair . " Do n't make yourself morep128practical than you are , " he said . The ridges of his cheeks and jaw were hardened in a vitreous glaze . " You do n't have to burn down the house to live somewhere else . " " That 's typical . " Debbie cried . " Oh , Pa , that 's so typical ! It 's all right for you to criticize Norman day and night  --  you silently , Jonas openly but if I say something I 'm burning down the house ! " " I criticize ? " Solomon said . " Why , have you shown any enthusiasm ? " Debbie challenged him . " Debbie , be reasonable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic if a god walked through the door . As for Norman  --  I admit it  --  I was a little disappointed at first . You had something in your mind ? I had something in mine . You say yourself , Debbie , that you 're not what we thought you were . Maybe you 're right , maybe you 're wrong  --  you might be trying very hard these days to be somebody else  --  but Norman can be deceiving , too . You have found qualities in him ? Give us a chance to find them , too . " " Oh , Pa ! " Debbie expostulated . " You 'll never find them . I 'm not asking that you love Norman . It 's just that I 've become very , very tired of apologizing for someone as decent and intelligent as Norman . " She turned to Jonas . " Jonas , you are invited , cordially , to Norman 's home this Saturday evening . If you wish to come  --  and if you 'll behave like a civilized person  --  you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put too much of a strain on you , then please do n't . " " Maybe I 'd better not , " Jonas said . " Fine . I 'll make some apology for you . " " That would sound great , would n't it ? " Jonas said , following with fixity the brown interlocking design on the border of the table . " Do n't worry about that , " Debbie answered crisply . " If appearancesdo n't bother me , they should n't bother you ! " Jonas looked up at his sister . " Real tough these days , are n't you ? " he said , and left the table , the kitchen , the house . He walked in the evening haze toward the open area . The heat absorbed all day by the pavements radiated in the stagnant air , lifting a layer of asphalt-smelling warmth into the twilight . Light and sound were embedded in an atmosphere as soft and muffling asp129cotton batting . In the distance , the cars of the elevated train crawled toy-like toward a station . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their appearance taking on the inviolable order of chance junk in a landscape . Here a rusting pyramid of horizontal fire hydrants in a wire enclosure . Here a segment of a truck tire split open at the side like a gutted fish . Here an encrusted sewer well looking like a huge rotted molar pulled up from the earth . Jonas felt a touch of envy for the dumb imperviousness of things . He wanted to go back to the house and straighten out the terrible iron crimp he had left there , but he knew he lacked the strength and skill . Besides it was done , over . Debbie would marry Norman B. Prager , and Jonas Gould could do nothing to prevent it . He tried to remove his own aversion from Debbie 's happiness , to give Debbie 's happiness a separate value in his mind , but that value appeared stillborn , a dead fetus , with no squall of life to redeem its innate ugliness . But if Debbie is happy ? Why should that argument be so unavailing ? How much could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above what she so obviouslyand determinedly wanted ? Pure selfishness ? Selfishness ? What did he want ? He wanted nothing . If that was n't true , may his right arm wither in its socket ! He wanted Debbie to be happy . But he could not conceive of her happiness with Norman . No , that he could not do . It was not his Debbie who could be happy with Norman , but the Debbie who had just announced her smallness and her Prager practicality . There were two truths , then ; three ; four ; countless truths . The Debbie who existed for him was true , but so was the Debbie who existed for herself and Norman Prager . The Debbie who existed for him could not endure to be Norman 's wife ; the other could . And Solomon ? What was true for him ? . . . Jonas felt as though he were growing smaller , tiny , microscopic  --  or else reality had blown itself so large that he could see each cell divide , and the resultant two divide again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mitosis . He shook away this fantasy , and the warm blue evening restored itself.  |p130On  the playing field of the school , two kids practiced shot-put with rocks . They teetered and balanced as they had seen athletes do , and the rocks which rose from their hands described a comically feeble arc . Looking at them , Jonas was made to feel his own powerlessness . This powerlessness joined another that had its source far away , in central Europe , where the city of Danzig remained immovablystationed on a bay that opened into the Baltic Sea . There was no connection , of course , but neither was it totally irrelevant . He had n't asked for either to impinge on his life , but since they both seemed determined to , it would be interesting to see if one might not resolve the other . Jonas walked until it was dark , and then he returned home . He entered the kitchen , took out the box of Mallomars , and poured himself a glass of milk . Debbie , who had changed into a light house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa ? " Jonas asked . " He went for a walk , " Debbie said . " Big evening for walks . . . . Debbie , I 'm sorry , " he said . " If the invitation is still open , I 'd like to meet Norman 's family . " Debbie sat down and faced Jonas . " The invitation is still open , " she said . " You do n't know how much you hurt me . Jonas , you must try to be more tolerant . Nothing is ever completely the way you think it is , or the way you 'd like it to be . I did n't love Norman right away . He loved me  --  so much that I wished I could love him in return . He once said I should n't worry about that . If I could n't , I could n't ; when the time came he would know it , and I would n't have to worry . But that time never came . Some people have to see love before they can love themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not love , " Debbie answered . " They wanted . " " Is that the way it works ? " Jonas asked . " Because he loves you , you love him ? " " Because he loves me , I see what you do n't see , " Debbie said . On Saturday morning , Jonas gave Debbie her gift . She opened the box and held up the blouse . " It 's beautiful , Jonas ! " she exclaimed . " Just beautiful ! " She held it against her to let him see howp131it would look , and in a sorrowful drop of surmise Jonas knew that she would keep it for years and years , carefully folded and wrapped in tissue paper , with perhaps a sachet of aromatic herbs , but that she would seldom wear it . The look she would seek to keep Norman 's humble love from quailing would never be one to dazzle and suggest . Solomon 's gift was something he had kept for years against just such a time . Two pearls that had belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierced ears . Debbie sat down on the sofa with the skirt and blouse in her lap and the earrings resting in the palm of her hand . Jonas waited to see the rare phenomenon of tears in his sister 's eyes . But Debbie did n't cry . She looked down at the carpet in an unseeing time-gaze . Jonas understood , then , that she had no need of tears . There may have been poignance , but there was no regret . They started out from the apartment house at six o'clock that evening . Looking over his shoulder , Jonas saw a huge incendiary sun balanced on the green dome of the school building . An announcement of some kind . By the time they reached their destinationin Brooklyn , it was dark . Norman came to the door at Debbie 's ring . He kissed Debbie , shook hands with Solomon , with Jonas , and ushered them all into his home with a surprisingly unagitated air . He handled the introductionsformally , methodically . There was an older brother and a younger sister , both unmarried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie . He nodded a great deal and from time to time brushed his palm across the top of his bald head . Mrs. Prager was a short bustling woman . She served a meal that began with a baseball of chopped liver in a corolla of lettuce . Then there was cold borsht , roast chicken , potatoes , and many different kinds of overcooked vegetables . For dessert , the cold meat of melons scooped into balls . Norman 's brother , Arthur , taught economics at one of the city 's colleges . The younger sister , Mildred , looked frequently at Jonas . An oscillating fan placed on the window sill waved the dense , humid mixture from side to side . Solomon did well . He was cordial in his deep bass way , thinking of proper questions to ask when none were being asked of him.  |p132Arthur  engaged Jonas in a conversation about the printing business , and Jonas amazed himself with the amount of information he was able to impart . And later , when they had retired to the living room , Jonas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pragers . They knew , of course , that it was her birthday , and they all had gifts . Norman 's was The Ring . A diamond , modest but tasteful . The kissing and handshaking and congratulations that followed threatened to become a permanently circulating vortex . The Pragers turned first to the " happy couple , " and then to the Goulds , and then to each other , and then back to Debbie and Norman . Mrs. Prager wept a little . Arthur gathered it all together in a short speech expressingthe family 's delight in Deborah Gould . Lucky , lucky Norman to have found such a girl ! And that was genuine enough . Norman presented a calm center in that hurricane of felicity . He did n't appear the least uncomfortable with his family 's exuberance  --  as many a strained young man might have done  --  but neither did he partake of it . He looked , rather , pale and dignified , as one who had just undergone a profound religious devotion , with daylong prayer and fasting , and who still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonas shook his hand , Norman said , quite seriously ; " You and I have at least two things in common , Jonas . We both love Debbie , and we both think she 's much too good for me . That 's all right . I do n't blame you . It 's true . But I hope we shall become good friends . It 's my sincerest wish . " Jonas said , " Mine too , Norman . You bet . " Debbie was wearing the earrings Solomon had presented to her that morning . She made sure the Pragers noticed them . Then she described the lovely peasant blouse and skirt that was Jonas 's gift . There was ease and familiarity in Debbie 's manner . It was evident she knew the Pragers well . She moved into the wide warm circle of that family as into an old affiliation , and they in turn absorbed her . There was perfect accord here . This was the home Debbie had missed , had sought . Jonas tasted sulphur . In a remote corner of memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his sister ,  |p133wra|p|ped  in foreignness , had announced she was going " out . " The years formed a circle and looped over Jonas 's heart in a dreamrubbedcoil of prophecy . Jonas read the morning paper astride the jiggling platform between cars . Seats were always available at his station , but Jonas adhered to the principle of never taking one . It was his conviction that every pregnant woman and consumptive old man immediately upon entering the car was advised of his sedentary presence by a solicitous ghost . They were taken by the hand and led over to where that healthy lump of a boy was sitting with the admonition to " sway " whispered in their ears , and to " groan " if the first hint was n't taken . The moral struggle lasted for barely a station . He gave up seats completely . The chain-clinking , jiggling area between cars offered privacy , and air conditioning , of a sort . After years of practice , Jonas was able to luff and veer so that he could actually use the breeze in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item about the limb of a tree on Fifth Avenue fallingon an open bus , killing one passenger and injuring several . Jonas thought of Ruth . What if she had been killed ? Alex Klein might spend the rest of his life trying to retrace the circumstances that would account for his wife 's being on that bus at that time . And with Ruth 's death would die the secret of her unfaithfulness . Alex would mourn , anguish , at his great loss , when , had he known the truth , he might have felt a vengeful satisfaction . There was a complicatedset of equations here that skipped away as Jonas clumsily reached for them . Leo Ackerman had been right . He did keep sexual score . He had made love to Ruth eight times . She had never asked him to use " one of those things . " That meant she used something , or could n't have children in any event , or was taking the risk knowingly , or perhaps wished to have a child by him  --  although it was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its paternity . He must phone Ira . He had n't seen Ira in weeks . Was Ira angry ? About the California thing ?  |p134There  was another item in the paper . . . . The German Reich and the Soviet Union had signed a seven-year treaty . " I do n't believe it , " Solomon said that evening . " Maybe it 's the way they report it . These things are meaningless . I read some time ago that England offered Germany a big loan . You know I have no use for Stalin , but he would n't get in the same bed with Hitler . I know the Russians . They trust no one , but Germans they trust least of all . I would n't be surprised if this was the beginning of a general negotiation for peace . Have you ever thought of that ? Naturally , Hitler would n't begin with England or France ... Solomon was excited . Jonas and Debbie had n't seen him so excited for a long time . His was the kind of idealism that felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal . Born in Russia , he had left while still a boy , carrying memories of rifle fire and wild running in the streets . The revolution was a bright flare , but he became disillusioned with the first maneuvers after Brest-Litovsk . Lenin made mistakes , but he was still an idealist . He quoted from the great works of literature . Stalin was ignoranceenthroned . While others were beginning to see in Russia the light of the world , that nation sank out of sight for Solomon . Secretly , however , he expected to hear from the Russian people at the proper moment of history . For twenty-four hours , he harbored the hope that this might be the proper moment of history . The next day the headlines in the Times stretched from border to border . The seven articles of the treaty were spelled out . Solomon was silent and somber throughout dinner . " It 's the same treaty as yesterday , " Jonas said . Solomon said nothing . Ruth had designated Thursday as the day Jonas could  --  mustphoneher at her house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Usually .... " Usually ? " Jonas had asked . . . . " Well , it would n't make a difference even if Alex were at home , " Ruth had replied . " I 'm free to receive calls , you know . From anyone . And I do . Unless you do n't want to , of course . " Jonas , in truth , did n't want to . Not at her home . Suppose Alexp135were to answer the phone ? ... " Yes , she 's at home . May I tell her who 's calling ? " . . . " Why , yes , do tell her . This is Jonas Gould . " ... " Who ? " . . . " Jonas Gould . I lay your wife a couple of times a week , you know . " . . . " No , I did n't know . Hold the phone a sec , I 'll put her on . " . . . Reasonably , anyone could be calling her , and no doubt Alex would simply hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ! ) Jonas did n't scruple out of fear . It was the brazenness that bothered him . Rubbing the man 's nose in a shitty humiliation . After all , he had nothing against Alex Klein . Phoning Ruth at home when Alex might be there struck him as a gratuitous piece of nastiness . But Ruth insisted , interpreted his objections as childishness , immaturity . Stung , Jonas phoned . " We 're having a party Saturday night , " Ruth said . " I want you to come . " " Who 's we ' ? " Jonas asked . " Alex and I. At our place . " " Are you joking , Ruth ? " " Joking . We are having a party . Why should I  --  ? " " I mean about me coming ? " " Why , would it embarrass you ? " " Do n't you think it should ? " " No , I do n't , " Ruth said . " Actually , it 's going to be a big party . There 'll be lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him ? " " Look , Ruth , " Jonas protested , " I may not be very sophisticated , but  --  " " Darling , there 's nothing to be afraid of . " " What time 's the party ? " Jonas asked . " Oh , about eight-thirty , nine . You see it 's not a dinner party  --  " " I 'll be there , " said Jonas.  |p136Ira  wore a navy-blue Palm Beach suit . The collar flaps of his white shirt were held in neat alignment with a maroon tie by a silver pin . He kept his left hand in his trouser pocket , an effect which together with an altered tilt of his head made for a different Ira . To assist the metamorphosis , he sported a healthy , if patchy , sun tan . His forehead and nose were scaling to a secondary pink , but the rest was nicely cured . " You 're looking fit , " Jonas said , as they strolled toward the subway . " Where 've you been ? " " At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a summer place . I spent a few days there . Have you been playing handball ? " " Not recently . " " So I gathered . I looked for you one Sunday . " " When was that ? " " Oh , I do n't know . Couple of weeks ago . Have you been seeing the Kleins ? " " Me ? No . What do you mean ? " " Nothing , " said Ira . " I thought it a little peculiar that they would have . . . " Ira 's voice trailed . " That they would have what ? " Jonas asked . Ira waved a hand . " I may be mistaken about the nature of this party , in which case I 'd be putting my foot in it up to the crotch . " " Does it make any difference that I do n't know what the hell you 're talking about ? " Jonas said . " Could you fill me in a little ? " " Jonas , there 's nothing personal in all of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new , natty , unruffled Hirsch . " I was thinkingout loud , which can be an indiscretion or a compliment , dependingon how you look at it . It occurred to me that this might not bep137an entirely social party , which is what made me wonder why they thought of you . See ? Your connection with the Kleins is n't political , is what I mean .... I 'm being very mysterious , I know , but you may find out what I 'm jabbering about before the evening is over . " " Would you feel better if I did n't go ? " Jonas asked . Ira bowed his head and took hold of the upper part of Jonas 's arm , relinquishing the grip as he spoke . " No , I would n't feel better if you did n't go , " he said . " I 'd feel terrible . You must n't mind me . So much has been happening . The Nazi-Soviet Pact . The Hirsch-Hirsch Pact . I 'm going to Columbia Physicians and Surgeons next month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country a skill , if not a life . My father finally touched the right button . Medical school might be just the place for me the next few years . Hitler was Morton Hirsch 's secret ally all the time , just as he was Stalin 's . What do you think of the Pact ? " " Who knows ? " Jonas said . " You 'll find out who knows , " Ira said with a smile . Given the nudge by Ira , Jonas 's thoughts continued in the direction of fantasy . The opening gambit was Ruth 's confession to Alex . Alex , wounded but wise , had requested this painful meeting . ( That talk of " big party " was just a ruse . ) They must sensibly discuss the feelings and wishes of all involved . Do you , Jonas , take this woman , Ruth , to be your unlawfully affianced partner in daytime doings and nighttime screwings ? ( " Do you see this gun ? Now I 'm warning you , you lousy bastard , you stay away from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth , Ruth , how could you do this to me ? " ) . . . No . Nothingof the sort . . . . Sit down  --  uh  --  I 'm sorry , but your name has slipped my mind again  --  ah , yes !  --  Jonas -- Jonas Gould  --  well , I think we can be civilized about this .... But how about Ira ? Where does Ira fit it ? Ira , being a friend of the party of the second part , being a friend all around , has been called in to lend his guiltriddencounsel . . . . " So you think there 's going to be a war ? " Jonas asked Ira . " What do you think ? " Ira asked in return . " I think yes , " said Jonas . " I think yes , too , " said Ira . " It 's like reaching the point where you know you 've got to complete that wet dream . "  | " What am I going to find out before the evening is over ? " Jonas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may be dead wrong . Let 's wait and see . " Jonas 's curiosity had n't inclined him toward envisioning the apartmentwhere Ruth and Alex Klein lived , so he should n't have been surprised at what he found . But he was . He was surprised to find that they occupied two floors . He was surprised at the chalky whitenessof the rooms . He was surprised at the height of the ceilings . The lower floor was Alex 's studio ; one very large room where artist 's paraphernalia lay strewn about in serious profusion . Upstairs there were many people and much noise and glasses and music from a record player and Alex Klein with a curved pipe . He held out his hand to Ira . " I 'm happy to see you , Ira , " Alex said quite genuinely . Then he turned to Jonas . " How are you , Jonas ? It 's nice to see you again . ... Now , gentlemen , there 's my wife 's famous punch , if you care for that ; or I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial for me , " Ira said . " Come with me , " said Alex . " You 're looking extremely dapper and prosperous , Ira . " They entered the kitchen . " How do you explain that ? " " I 'm spending my inheritance before it 's too late , " Ira said . " Oho ! " Alex chuckled . Ruth stood talking to another girl , one hand resting on the edge of the sink , the other holding a cup of purple punch . Catching sight of Jonas and Ira , she leaned closer to her companion with conspiratorialquickness , as if those last words might never be said unless said in that instant . The skilled emphasis of her make-up gave her dark-eyed , dark-haired handsomeness so high a luster that Jonas was stunned into a denial of the intimacies he had known . He saw Ruth freshly and familiarly , as stranger and lover , and all this paradox was somehow expressed in the blouse she wore . It was the same peasant blouse he had bought for Debbie , the identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this complex gift of love became a harshness in his throat , where a sudden , enforced cry was crushed to silence.  | " Do n't you look nice , " she said to Ira , shaking hands with him . " Hello , Jonas . " And shook hands with him . " Scotch or rye ? " Alex asked . " Rye and ginger ale , " Ira said . " I 'll have the same , " said Jonas . " Nobody is going to bother to introduce anybody to anybody , " Ruth warned , " so you might just as well go inside and make yourselvesknown . " Jonas and Ira went into the other room where the guests were gathered . The only person Jonas recognized was Frank Mulloy , who was listening to a tall , buck-toothed girl while ingesting and disgorgingsmoke through all the flues of his handsome Barrymore profile . Someone hailed Ira and took him away , and Jonas was left standing with his drink . The singing voice coming from the other end of the room cut through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " plok " of a struck guitar  --  a Spanish song ... Jonas jumped at the hand that touched , then squeezed , his own for a secret second . Ruth stood beside him , the hostess attending an isolated guest . " You 're not going to stand in a corner by yourself all evening , " she said . " I want you to talk to everybody except the pretty girls . " " Did you buy that blouse in the same place ? " Jonas asked . " Yes . " " How come ? " " Do n't you like it ? " " You know I like it . " " Does it look better on me than on your sister ? " " Is that why you bought it ? " " I wish you could kiss me , " Ruth said . " Right now . " She was acting . Jonas realized it at first with surprise , and then with amusement . She was masking her words with a mummer 's assortment of counterfeit expressions and deceptive feints . Expressingher wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , a disinterestedsmile on her lips , as though mere politeness kept her in conversation with this young man . The play of her features was in artful variance with the words that passed between them . The puzzling movement of her lips made it seem that she was strugglingp140with a speech impediment or a foreign language , and Jonas understood that this was a deliberate subterfuge meant to deceive a would-be lip reader . But no one in the room was paying any attention to her lips , and Jonas knew that she felt perfectly safe , and that all of this was really an exercise of talent , an impromptu display meant to entertain and impress . It was for his sake , but just as much for her own . Perhaps more for her own than for his . And Jonas was both pleased and critical . He was pleased to be part of this charade , and he was critical of the excess . Love may have inspired the performance , but self-love provided the embellishments . " I can kiss you , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Are you daring me ? " No , " Ruth said quickly , a shadow of anxiety crossing her face . " You can kiss me all you want on Tuesday , and Wednesday , and Thursday . Alex is going to Rochester . Will you phone me on Tuesday , around noon ? I can make dinner for us here . " " No , " Jonas said . " Why not ? " " This is Alex 's home . " " It 's my home , too . " " I could n't , " Jonas said , becoming conscious of the scene , themselvestalking away in the midst of all these people , Alex over there not ten feet away . At the same time , in the basement of this hasty moral edifice , Jonas felt a libidinous scratch , the ever-present little mouse in the woodwork . There . Go away . It would n't . This desirablewoman desiring him , shamelessly , insistently . He said , " I 'll phone you Tuesday . " " Do you love me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave you now . " " I should think so . " Ruth walked away . Jonas moved in the opposite direction , going nowhere , just moving . He tried to look less like a lost sheep , but how could you not look like a lost sheep when you were by yourself in a crowded room where everybody was talking or listening ? Any expression of self-sufficiency would resemble an imbecile 's preoccupa/tion . Jonas sought Ira , and found him coming out of the kitchen again , his glass replenished . Jonas waited to see where Ira would go , and then he worked himself over to that group . He took a position on the fringe and listened to some talk of theatre . While doing so , his gaze roved around the room . Except for the few he knew , these faces were unknown to him . Unknown but not unfamiliar . He did not know them in particular , but he knew them in general . The men wore summer sport shirts , white , colored , open at the neck . Some wore jackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Ruth , blouses and skirts . Jonas had seen these people and these clothes any morning on the subway , any hot day at the World 's Fair . There was nothing particularly " party " about them . Nor did any of the men rise above the others in a physical pronouncement of richer soil , keener air , mightier games . With the exception of himself ( quite literally the only exception ) , they were average to small . That included Ira , who was easily the best-dressed , and Frank Mulloy , who was easily the best-looking . The women , it seemed to Jonas , were handsomer as women than the men were as men , but , again , none remotely approachedbeauty . Not even Ruth . Ruth was attractive , more than enough to satisfy the most vagrant of his desires , but she was not beautiful . Her hair was a little too coarse , her hips a little too heavy . Jonas joyfully absolved these faults , but he recognized their disqualifyingnature in any objective standard of beauty . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , city people that Jonas had lived among most of his life . They were probably teachers and students , accountants ( like Norman , who would certainly not be out of place here ) , actors and actresses ( who would succeed , if at all , as serious students of a serious art ) , skilled and semiskilled workers , perhaps a few in the professions , a doctor , a lawyer , and many , no doubt , held jobs , as he did himself , in the always astonishingvariety of trades and shops and businesses that abound in the city . Jonas imagined that none was wealthy , and none terribly poor . They were the kind of people who valued education , had had education , and would go on seeking education for the rest of their lives . They valued progress and politics . They were not like him in many ways , yet he knew there were no other people with whom he wouldp142develop an affinity but these . He felt no happiness in this recognition . To belong somewhere meant not to belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still a shrinkage of the dream . Jonas became aware of a change in the room , although nothing had been announced , no sudden breaking off of the scattered conversations . Ira had ducked out again to the kitchen , and returned with a full glass . The group he was with had begun to drift toward that corner of the room where Alex Klein held the center of attention . Gradually more and more of the guests headed in that direction , and at last Ira , taking Jonas by the arm , announced sonorously , " Oh , do not ask , " What is it ? " Let us go and make our visit .... " ' ... but let me point out , " Alex was saying , in a tone that disclaimedany secret knowledge or higher wisdom ( the same tone he had used that night in the cafeteria the night the Federal Theatre Project ended ) , " that the Soviet Union had signed a treaty of nonaggressionwith Italy in nineteen thirty-three , but that did n't preventher from sending aid to Loyalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't pretend to be an official interpreter of Soviet policy , but it seems to me that entirely too much is being made of the treaty . . . . " Here Alex flopped the back of his right hand into the palm of his left as he proposed the question : " What does it say ? It says that the Soviet Union and Germany will not assist any country that attacks any party to the treaty . How long have the Municheers been trying to turn Hitler against the Soviet Union ? Do n't you see that this breaks the back of the appeasement group ? Now they know they ca n't use Hitler to destroy the Soviet Union .... " Jonas listened attentively to Alex , knowing now that this was the purpose of the party ; that Alex was giving the Word. . . . if it 's such a terrible betrayal , " Alex was saying , " why is it that the Chinese , who have been fighting Japanese Fascism for years , are celebrating the treaty ? Because they know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think the Japanese like a nonaggression pact between an ally and an enemy ? Seriously , it 's an overlooked item , but , you know , Europe is n't the world . Thep143Soviet Union 's borders extend from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean ... Jonas felt himself losing the line of Alex 's reasoning . Besides he was more interested in the man . Because of Ruth , Alex Klein had assumed a variety of shapes in Jonas 's mind . He was unreal , a figure of smoke , a phantasmagorical creature composed of Jonas 's own guilt and perplexity . But here he was , and he was , after all , no more than a man with receding , kinky hair and a round face which remindedJonas of a math teacher he once had in high school . Alex spoke slowly , with frequent pauses , closing his eyes during these pauses and then opening them with a refurbished glint of deep , but not unhumorous , sincerity . His countenance gave no clue to the fate his wife had prepared for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would fix Alex Klein firmly and forever in his mind . . . . He listened. " ... that it is not England and France that Hitler fears , but the Soviet Union . The treaty is a public acknowledgment of that . The working classes in all the capitalist countries will see this , and it will strengthen their determination to prevent another Munich betrayal . " Alex  --  " The voice was loud and clear , and came from a point so close to Jonas that he instinctively recoiled lest he be taken for its source . Turning , he saw that it was Ira . Alex smilingly submitted to what was clearly an expected , even a welcomed interruption . " Yes , " he said . " Who is that ? . . . Oh , Ira . ... Yes , Ira ? " " Shit , " Ira said . The word had magical properties . A lane opened between Alex and Ira , like the parting of the Red Sea . " What ? " Alex said . " I said shit , " Ira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , " Alex said , raising a hand . " I heard you , Ira . I 'm a little surprised at the language , but nevertheless  --  " " Black is n't white , " Ira said . " Not even these days . What are youp144trying to tell us , Alex ? The treaty 's a good thing ? What would it be if England and France had signed a nonaggression pact with Hitler ? " " Knowing Chamberlain , it would be another Munich betrayal , " Alex answered . " But with Stalin , it 's peaches and cream .... " " Trotskyite ! " someone accused . " No slogans , " Alex requested . Then to Ira , " You make no distinctionsbetween Stalin and Chamberlain ? " Ira was white . The little smile of challenge twitched uneasily on his lips . He held his head high and to one side , in his fashion , but it teetered tremulously , as if it were being balanced by a spring in the nape of his neck . His cry of protest had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guessed that the desperation was n't purely a matter of outraged political sensibilities . It was connected to other protests , other betrayals . " I think , " Ira said breathlessly , " I think you 're out of your mind . What strengthen ? What prevention ? How much time is there ? You want a distinction ? I 'll give you a distinction . Chamberlain sold Czechoslovakia . Stalin sold Poland . That 's all the distinction there is ! " " Stooge ! " " Provocateur ! " " Ira , what 's the matter with you ? " " Wait a minute , wait a minute . . . . " Alex had both arms raised . " I 'm not going to listen to this shit any more ! " Ira yelled . " Everybody'sgot ideas ! Everybody 's got the answer ! The truth is as plain as this big , ugly , Jewish nose on my face ! " Ira cupped the fingers of his right hand over his nose and held it as he went on yelling , " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow ! The next day ! How much good are your ideas going to do you then ? You can all file suit against Alex Klein ! My brother will represent you ! He 's a very good lawyer and  --  and  --  and  --  and he 'll make it a very reasonable fee ! . . . Excuse me , would you please .... " Ira made his way through the guests , arms up , as though expecting a blow , nodding his head , murmuring , " Excuse me , excusep145me . . . . " Jonas followed him out of the room , down the stairs , into the street . Ira walked rapidly toward Fifth Avenue . His breathing became so labored that Jonas put a restraining hand on his arm , but Ira seemed not to notice . He put one hand on top of his head , and then the other , as though his brain were threatening to tear through the top of his skull . He staggered over to a doorway and there sank to his knees , rocking back and forth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has gone far beyond the limit of his endurance . His whole body shuddered in the effort to suck enough air into his lungs . Jonas became frightened . He squatted beside Ira , not knowingwhether to leave him there and run for help , or to try  --  something . But what ? Artificial respiration ? Ira seemed to be drowning in terror  --  and as he rocked forward one more time he gagged and vomited , spewing a mess over the inner wall of the embrasure in which he kneeled . " I think he 'll feel better now , " said a voice above Jonas . It was Frank Mulloy . " What shall we do with him ? " Jonas asked . " Let 's try to get him out of there before he fouls himself completely , " Frank said . They hoisted Ira between them . He was a dead weight , limp , vilesmelling . They dragged him farther along the street toward Fifth Avenue , finally stopping and allowing Ira to sink against a building . He was able to remain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his face . His breathing had become more regular , but he continued to keep his eyes shut , giving no sign of consciousness . Jonas squatted once more . He took out his handkerchief and wiped Ira 's mouth . " Ira , you all right ? " he asked . " Do you want me to get help ? An ambulance ? " Ira drew up his legs and circled them with his arms . He shook his head slowly . Jonas got up . " What do you think is the matter with him ? " he asked Frank . " I do n't know , " Frank said . " Was he drinking much up there ? " " I saw him in and out of the kitchen a few times , " Jonas said . " Ido n't know how many times he was in there that I did n't see . " Frank lighted a cigarette . He looked down at Ira with consideringp146eyes . He said , " You 're a damn fool , Ira . I told you you 'd make yourselfsick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are you able to get up ? " Ira shook his head . Frank said to Jonas , " Why do n't you go to the corner and see if you can get a cab . We 'll take him to my place . " Jonas ran toward Fifth Avenue , tossing away the soiled handkerchief . At the corner he hailed a cab . " Drive down the block here , will you ? " he said to the cabbie . " There 's a couple of friends I want to pick up . " The cabbie looked at him suspiciously , but allowed him into the cab and drove where directed . " Here , " said Jonas . The cabdriver looked over at the figure on the pavement . " Uh-uh , " he said . " I 'm not having any drunks puke all over my cab . " Frank approached the man , reaching into his back pocket for his wallet . He took out a five-dollar bill and gave him an address on Sixty-ninth Street . They got Ira into the cab , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank , his head reclining against the back rest . " You do n't by any chance have a bad heart ? " Frank asked . Ira spoke his first words since his seizure . " I 'm all right , " he said , his eyes still closed . " I can see that , " Frank said . " You do this sort of thing every night , do n't you ? . . . Will you be able to walk when we get to my place ? " " I do n't know , " Ira said . " I do n't know what happened to me . " " A fuse blew , " Frank said . " Overload . " " I 've got an awful headache , " Ira moaned . " Oh , my God , what a headache ! " " We 'll get you something for that . " They arrived at their destination . Ira walked unassisted from the cab . The building they entered was one of those looming facades that make up the austerity of Manhattan 's east side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two fingers to the visor of his cap . " Evening , Ralph , " Frank said . " Another hot one . " " Yes , indeed , Mr. Mulloy . A dilly . " He looked at Ira , whose lapel was glaucously streaked.  | " Friend of mine had a bit too much , " Frank explained . " We 're going to tidy him up . " " That 's quite all right , sir . " The hall was in the Roman style : marble benches , curule chairs , large frescoes on the walls . A brown-paneled elevator rode upward with the well-oiled deference wealthy people expect . Everything about Frank Mulloy began to fall into place . The voice , the manner , the cigarettes , everything . Money . Of course . Frank opened the door to his apartment with his key . There were lights on inside . " Vic , " Frank called . " Hello , " a voice called back . " I 've got some friends with me , " Frank advised the voice within . They walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ira to take off his jacket . Ira did so , and Frank dangled the garment from one finger . " Stretch out over there , on the divan , " Frank told Ira . " Make yourself comfortable , " he said to Jonas . Ira unlaced his shoes and dropped them to the floor as he lifted his legs onto the divan . His face was still greenish in color , but his eyes , though half-closed in weariness , showed signs of awareness . He turned his head and looked at Jonas , pursing his lips and wagging a finger before them . He was signaling some sort of caution . Dumbshowfashion , Ira performed a sweeping gesture with his arm , askingthat Jonas take in all that there was to see . Then Ira made a horriblypained face and pressed the ball of either hand to his temples . " Head still hurt ? " Jonas asked . " Oh , my God ! " Ira groaned . Holding his hands against his head , he said to Jonas , " I thank you for standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , but it was hysterical of me to make such a scene . I knew exactly what was going to happen . I should n't have gone , that 's all . Incidentally , did you agree with me ? " " Yes , " Jonas replied , considering for the first time what , indeed , was his attitude on all the tumult , and deciding , although not passionately , that he sided with Ira . With Ira and with his father . It was a sellout . It was just what Ira had said . Chamberlain sold Czechoslovakia . Stalin sold Poland . He thought of Ruth and wondered how she would feel about his having walked out with Ira . ... Also , he had followed the demonstrative wave of Ira 's hand , viewing the penetralia of Frank Mulloy 's life and finding it all toop148strange for judgment . A shiny brass helmet resting on a wooden stool . A shiny brass breastplate mounted on the wall . A long heavy table along one wall , its edges beveled smooth by time ; and behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricate carvings in their wooden backs . The seats of the chairs were covered with faded scarlet cushions . " The real thing , " Ira whispered . " Refectory table and chairs . Seventeenth century . " Frank came through the swinging door near the refectory table carrying a glass of water and two pills . The door swung back behind him , its momentum carrying it into the room from which Frank had come . In that brief instant before the door closed in a return swing , Jonas glimpsed into a kitchen and saw a young man standing with his behind propped against a sink and his arms folded across his chest . He wore light-blue slacks and a lemon-colored shirt of silky texture . He was blond and sullen-looking . " Here , " Frank said to Ira . " Take these . " Ira swallowed the pills . He said , " I 'm sorry to flop all over you this way , Frank . You 're a real buddy . I 'm disgusting . I ca n't even stand up to Alex Klein without having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political person , " Frank said . He moved across the room to a cabinet , opening its doors and taking from its shelf a decanter of wine and some glasses . He filled three glasses , carrying two of them to Ira and Jonas . Then he returned for the third . " You are not a political person , " he repeated , drawing emphasis from the variation . " You 're an artist . Sometimes I argue with God 's choice in these endowments .... " " How odd of God to choose the Jews ' ? " Ira said . Frank smiled . " You know me better than that . But why you and not me ? " Frank sat down on the other end of the divan where Ira was lying . He raised his voice and called , " Vic , why do n't you join us ? " The young man came from the kitchen . If Frank Mulloy was handsome , this one was beautiful . There was no other word for it . The flawlessness of his features reflected the perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth . . . . More of Frank Mulloy became clear to Jonas.  |p149Frank  made the introductions . Victor Fuller was the fellow 's name . His grip was surprisingly wiry . He sat down on something that looked like a high hassock and interlaced his fingers around his knee . He was wearing straw-woven slippers , and when he raised his leg slightly in the sling of his hands , the back part of the slipper fell away from the heel of his foot , as Jonas had seen happen to women 's shoes on occasion . His movements were delicate and precise , like a cat 's . His blue eyes were steady and distrustful , like a cat 's . " We 're having wine , " Frank said to Vic without looking at him . " Why do n't you help yourself . " Vic made the merest gesture of refusal . " We were discussing nature 's indiscriminate ways , " Frank went on . " The subject is n't new to Vic . He 's heard me go on about it before . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I hope you do n't envy me , " Ira said . The back of his hand was resting against his forehead . His eyes were shut again . " I do , " said Frank . " Very much . " " Then you 're out of your mind , " Ira said . " You do n't know what you 're saying . Why should you want anything more than you 've got ? " " Do n't be silly , " Frank retorted . " You know very well that what I have means nothing to me . The one thing I have n't got is more important than all the rest . " Jonas had the feeling that each of these men had rehearsed these lines in private  --  or at least the emotions which produced these lines . Vic Fuller swung his leg slightly from side to side . His removal from this talk was at the distance burning glasses are held . " You 're welcome to my paltry gifts , free of charge , " Ira murmured . " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Frank rejoined . " Except , you see , I 'm being honest and you 're not . You know very well that your gifts are non-negotiable , while I 'm perfectly willing and able to part with money . " The difference between Ira and Frank was evident in more than their statements . Ira had lapsed into what appeared to be a comatose state . Every cell had surrendered to the divan . After pain and misery , he was without pain and misery  --  sublimity in itself . Butp150there was in one tiny corner of his expiring consciousness an appreciation of what he was saying and what was being said to him . By pretending to despise what he could not give away , Ira dipped the irony in acid , and thus enjoyed a homely man 's revenge on all the shining creatures . But Frank Mulloy was very conscious and very truthful . He wanted what he could not have , and there was something in the way he confessed to the want that revealed its depth . In a low tone , Frank asked Jonas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him home tonight ? " " I think he told me his folks were away at the shore , " Jonas said . Frank looked at Ira .... " Ira . " No answer . " I guess he 'll have to sleep it off here , " Frank said . Jonas saw himself getting up and bellowing his objection to that arrangement . He heard himself say he 'd lug his friend over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes before he 'd leave him with a couple of fairies . He did nothing of the sort . He said , " I can wait until he gets up . " " To which Frank replied , " You 'll be waiting most of the night . He 's going to sleep a long time . You 're welcome to , of course , if you want to . " Frank smiled . " Do n't worry about him , " he added . " He 'll be all right . " " Oh , sure , I know that . I mean  --  I did n't  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well  --  " said Jonas , and he was on his feet , shaking hands , saying so long , hoping Ira felt better in the morning , promising to look in on Ira at home to see if he was all right , saying he was pleased to have met the mute and medieval Vic Fuller . Jonas glided down in the noiseless elevator . The doorman touched his cap and opened the door . Out into the warm , welcome evening . He walked to Fifth Avenue . The scene he had just left hung in his mind like a tapestry whose colors were already fading . A setting out of another time , with poor Ira asleep in its weave like a captured boy in a fairy tale . A prince , perhaps , hexed by a witch , who after sleeping off the magic potion would wake up to be his tall , lithe , glamorous self . . . . No , Ira would wake up in the morning seedyp151as hell , with pouches under his eyes , and a bad breath , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused both himself and Frank Mulloy much anguish . Jonas walked several blocks before he realized that his destination was home . Vaguely he had thought of going back to the party  --  it was still early enough  --  but he had no desire to . He wanted to go home and sit in the kitchen gripping a cold bottle of milk as if that were the axis of the world and he could by the strength of his good handball arm adjust it to the angle he desired . What had he to do with all of this ? How was it possible to reconcileAdolf Hitler and Ira Hirsch ? Solomon Gould and Frank Mulloy ? Norman Prager and Vic Fuller ? Why were so many strange flowers popping up through the days and nights of this hot summer ? The world was carrying him to a destiny he had n't foreseen , and he was n't at all sure that he wanted that destiny . What he did want , right now , was to flip a small black ball with a backward spin and catch it neatly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder it against the wall !  |p152If  it was Armageddon , one could be almost grateful that it had come at a time when there were such history-prepared media and history-prepared voices to announce it . Certainty had leaked through the fissures , and there was general acceptance that the last week in August was the last week of peace . Radio commentatorslent their individual flourishes to the massed trumpeting . Since the icecap had moved north leaving Europe richly green and periodically bloody , there had n't been a curtain raiser like it . The impossible was about to happen , and the blaring reached so tumultuous a crescendo on radio and in the headlines that it seemed the great suicide act would have to come off if only to make good on its advance publicity . To leave the radio for an instant was to risk missing the final plunge . Nevertheless , Debbie Gould left the radio and spent her evening hours looking in local stores at kitchen sets and dinettes , at Regency and Colonial , at muslin and percale . And her father went with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was no mother to do so , and the fatal plunge , to him , would not be so thrilling . And Alex Klein left for Rochester , which was as good a place to be as any . And Ruth Klein made dinner at home . " So she 's going to marry that fellow you do n't like , " she said to Jonas . " I 'm liking him better all the time , " Jonas said . " Really ? " " That 's what I tell myself . " " But you do n't believe it . "  | " If I tell myself often enough , maybe I 'll believe it . I do n't know . Norman 's okay . He 's got good prospects and a heart murmur . " " Ca n't you sit still ? " Ruth asked . " I 'm looking at your books , " Jonas explained . " I 've never seen so many books outside a library . Have you read them all ? " " Alex has . " " And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " " About Russia . He was wrong about that , was n't he . That was no peace-loving pact . That was just a plain old double cross . " " You do n't understand these things , " Ruth said , her gaze lowering to the settings she was arranging on the table . " Where did you go after you left with Ira ? " " No place , " Jonas told her . " Right up the street , where Ira got as sick as a dog . Frank Mulloy took him to his place . Where does Frank get all his money ? " " From his family , " Ruth replied . " They live in Michigan . I 'm told his father owns a factory that supplies the auto companies with parts . They 're millionaires . I do n't know the whole story . Alex thinks they must have paid Frank to get out and stay out . He 's a homosexual , you know . " " Homosexual ? What 's that ? " Ruth looked at him , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible he did n't know . There was so much he did n't know . She saw him smiling . " Oh , stop it , " she reprimanded . " He did n't make a pass at you by any chance , did he ? " " No , but I had to leave Ira sleeping there . There was someone else in the apartment . Fellow by the name of Vic Fuller . " " I 've seen him , " Ruth said . " Beautiful is n't he ? " " Sickening ! " Ruth said , drawing down the corners of her mouth . " I do n't mind homosexuals , and Frank is one of the most decent men I 've ever met , but I ca n't stand freaks . " " Frank seems to like him , " Jonas remarked . " No , I 'll take that back . He did n't seem to like him . He paid no attention to him at all . I do n't understand it . "  | " You do n't understand what ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " What do they do to each other , Ruth ? " " Oh , Jonas ! " " I 'm not kidding . Before the world comes to an end , please explain to me what homosexuals do to each other . " " They kiss , " she said . " You do n't take my ignorance seriously enough , " Jonas complained . " I really and truly do not know what fairies do to each other . " " The same thing men and women do , only to each other , " Ruth said , walking into the kitchen . Jonas waited for her return . He was n't through with this . He was having fun with it . " But they ca n't do the same thing , " he said when she came back , " because one of them has n't got the same equipment . " " Well , then , use your imagination . " " I 'm using my imagination , Ruth . Does n't it hurt ? " " Please stop it , Jonas . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nervousness , he knew that , but he could n't stop . His nervousness took the form of a teasing banter , which acted to keep off the sense of sacrilege that came at him from every corner of the apartment . The room into which Ruth brought plates and silverware , bread and iced tea , was the same room where Alex Klein 's guests had heard last Saturday night 's sacrilege . Jonas had n't noticed all those books on Saturday night . They rose tier upon tier in bookcases that went halfway to the very high ceiling . Two walls were covered by them . There were bound sets of such ancient vintagethat the titles had eroded to a few faint specks of gold . Jonas took out one such book and opened it . The pages looked as though they had been seared by fire ; the texture was as friable as November leaves , the odor as mortuary as a tomb . Seeing him with the book in his hand , Ruth explained that she and Alex used to love to browse in the shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you love to any more ? " Jonas asked . Ruth did n't answer . She went into the kitchen and returnedp154shortly with two steaks on a platter . Just steaks and salad and bread rubbed with garlic . ( Not a Debbie specialty . Debbie never used garlic on anything . ) They sat down at the table and began to eat . Jonas suspected that he had spoiled a little the atmosphere Ruth had tried to create . He felt sorry about that , but it was not in his power to yield to whatever possessiveness or domesticity her feeling for the occasion had planned . Perhaps if she had been more unsure of herself ( dropped plate , tense laughter , tears ) , he might have felt called upon to fortify her spirit , but Ruth was , if anything , superfluously sure of herself . She was as confident as royalty giving a tea party , and Jonas wondered what ironclad contract with fate she thought she had that she could feel so exempt from the ghastly possibility of Alex 's footstep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was possible . Was n't it possible ? Earlier in the evening he had asked her that and she had replied no , it was impossible , because Alex had already phoned her from Rochester , just to announce his safe arrival , to say good night , to say he would see her on Friday . He always phoned upon arriving in Rochester . " So that 's how I know , my gallant Jonas . " " I 'm not used to this , " he said . " Neither am I , " she returned . " I 've never done this before . " " Then why are n't you shaking ? " he demanded . " Why do n't you jump every time you hear a car pass in the street ? " " Because that 's not the way I am , " she said . " Because I have n't got a guilty conscience . Like you . " " Why have n't you got a guilty conscience ? " he wanted to know . " I 'm not saying you should , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't there something about this situation that calls for a guilty con-science ? " " It could be that I love you , " Ruth said . " Some things are worth the risk . Or do n't you think so ? " He realized that his uneasiness was shouldering him onto the wrong side of discretion . It was a bad blunder to love and analyze at the same time . No one had told him this . He knew it . So he went to Ruth , who was gathering the plates from the table , and with her back to him he embraced her , reaching his arms around and takingp156into his hands the opulence of her breasts . He kissed her on the neck , under her hair , behind her ear , where the curve gave to his mouth the fullness of contact his appetite required . He could do that now , kiss her when he chose , where he chose , and this freedom was the passbook and vault key of his sensual wealth . That Ruth granted him this freedom with never a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she always wore a half-closed , votive expression on her face during these kisses , as if she were listening to the reading of a sacred text , gave to that wealth a replenishment beyond any hope of reckoning . " How can you love me ? " he asked . " I did n't even know who Stanislayski was . " " You 're an idiot , " she said . " Obviously you do n't love me . " " I do , " he swore . " You know I do . But I ca n't walk into this apartment and pretend it 's just another place . It 's not another place . It 's where Alex Klein lives . " " It 's where I live , too . " " I know . You 've said that before . But you do n't pay the rent . " Now Ruth was deeply shocked . " You have the mentality of the worst kind of bourgeois , " she said , handling the word as if it were a medal she had carried around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin it on . " Are you trying to tell me that it does n't make a difference ? " he asked . " Certainly not on that basis . " " Does it make a difference on any basis ? " " If you choose to let it make a difference . " " Ruth , for Christ sake , am I insane , or have you and I been living in different worlds ? Where do you get your ideas ? I want to be with you . I love you " ( He could say it ! ) , " but do n't call me names for feeling the way I do . It 's normal . I may be dumb as hell , but I 'm normal ! " Ruth covered her face with her hands and laughed . She sat down on a chair and laughed . She was n't being hysterical . She just thought it was very , very funny . " You 're normal , " she said.  |p157He  took her hands away from her face and kissed it  --  eyes , lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in their journey . " The percolator 's going like mad , " she said . When they had finished dinner , Jonas helped Ruth with the dishes . " You 're very handy , " she said . " I told you about my family , " he returned . " Oh , yes . All for one and one for all , and your sister is the queen bee . " " Wha-a-a-t ! What kind of remark is that ? What have you got against my sister ? " " I do n't have a thing against your sister , but it seems to me that any woman who has managed to get so much loyalty , even from a brother , must have known what she was doing . " It was Jonas 's turn to be shocked . Barbs against Debbie ! What could Ruth possibly have against Debbie , whom she did n't even know , had never met ? " ' Known what she was doing , ' " Jonas repeated , holding the phrase up and turning it this way and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clue . " Do you mean when she preparedten thousand meals and cleaned the house and did all the things that had to be done ? " " No less than ten thousand meals ? " " No less ! " Jonas returned sharply . " I 'll get you a certified statement , if you like . Do you think it was all a plot ? " " I think you 've been left with a lifetime consciousness of what your sister has done for you , " Ruth said . " And ? So ? She did it ? She did n't ask for the job . It fell on her , and she did it . " " Making sure that you and your father were very well aware of what she was doing . " This was incredible ! How could Ruth say such things ? Where could she possibly have gotten such an idea about Debbie ? " We lived in the same house , " Jonas declared , his voice finding new resonances . " Even if you were blind , you would find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no way ofp158concealing it , you see . My sister did n't ask for praise , but there 's appreciation all the same . Is that being very bourgeois ? " " You know so little about women , " Ruth sighed . " I can see that . " " Oh , I do n't care about your sister ! I hope she has a very happy life with her bookkeeper ! " " Accountant . " " Maybe you ought to run home and see if she needs you for any-thing . " " Maybe that 's a good idea ! " " Jonas  --  " " What ? " " You want to go , do n't you ? You do n't want to be here with me . " " That 's why I 'm here , because I do n't want to be . " " Then kiss me . " Solomon , by example rather than precept , had taught Jonas not to trust the obvious . Such simplicities as spite , greed , or jealousy were froth bubbling up to the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seethed around at the bottom . That 's why Solomon could never believe that the motives of his bosses were what they appeared to be  --  a fiercely direct drive for personal gain . That 's why he could go on playing chess with Kramer , thinking that the problemlay in Kramer 's personality and not in Kramer 's better chess head . That 's why Jonas could announce to himself with astonishment that Ruth was jealous of Debbie , then promptly drop the idea , then pick it up again with strange bits and pieces clinging to it . Perhapswhat Ruth was jealous of was not the Debbie who had received a beautiful peasant blouse from her brother , but the Debbie of competence and hard work . Because had n't she , Ruth , already confessed to feelings of inadequacy about herself , about her career ? That kind of jealousy was more understandable and more forgivablethan the other , and certainly there was something in the helpless ardor of Ruth 's embrace to make him think it was closer to the truth . On his way to Ruth 's apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit the final desecration , out of respect for himself if not Alex Klein . He had even tried to give some definition to hisp159casuistry , to set in order his own distinctions between fornication in and out of the Klein home . Outside it was Ruth 's affair  --  his , too , of course  --  but in any event not Alex 's  --  except , naturally , as accidental cuckold . It might have been anybody . Outside the Klein home , Alex remained an impersonal victim . Within these walls , the act became a conspiracy aimed specifically and unjustly at Alex Klein . There was no need for that . In a way it was comparable to the viciousness visited on the three sad night birds of Chink Adler 's aviary  --  pointless , cruel , invidious . . . . Surely Ruth would feel the same . Ruth did feel the same . At least she said so , nodding affirmation to his words . Having agreed to deny themselves the ultimate pleasure , they began a slow exploration of minor comforts . What could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed , and Jonas , wide-eyed in the dark , discovered hidden treasures of the body 's susceptibility . He prayed that no enemy bent on other purposes ever find them . Ruth , more blood-wise than he , knew what solvents would work against the discriminations of the mind . There was no mind , no Alex , no time , no place  --  only this aching dry hardness , that moist absolute relief . Importunately Ruth whispered him to less haste . Worshipfully he tried to obey . And then there was no obeying . She felt the convulsion begin in him and implored , " Please  --  oh please  --  wait for me ! " " Ruth ! " he died . And then , " Yes ! Oh , yes , my darling ! Yes , yes , yes , yes ! " Drenched , Jonas slid to ecstatic defeat . Later , they showered . Ruth changed the position of the fan so that its oscillations played directly over their bodies . Silent , spent , serene , not even their hands touching , they lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ruth began , " I was taking an art course in a school downtown . . . That was how she and Alex met . Alex was an instructor . She had decided to go back to school after breaking an engagement to a young man who was studying to be a pharmacist , and who had his father 's successful drugstore to step into as soon as he completed his studies . Bernard . Bernie Kagan . A nice-looking boy . Gave her a flashing ring and took her to expensive places . He told jokes . He wasp160the kind of man who remembered every joke he had ever been told , and the preliminaries of every human contact was no more than a jockeying for the climactic moment of the joke exchange . No , that was a little unfair . Bernie was also interested in his father 's business . He often confided his plans of how he intended to enlarge the store , to buy up adjacent property and make a glittering showplace of the tight little shop his father had spoon-fed to profitable health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , dining at the Taft Hotel with another couple , she listened to Bernie and decided she would rather be dead than married to the joketeller . That same evening she broke the engagement . Her mother had a fit . Her father did n't count . Her father was a plow horse who walked out of his stable at the same time every morning , was hitched to a worktable in a mattress-manufacturing plant , and came back ten hours later to eat a bundle of fodder and go to sleep . Ruth said she had often wondered whether her father had ever completely grasped the relationship of parent and child . Either he was born lacking the sense of paternity , or the woman he married had so thoroughly monopolized the function that it had withered and died in him . She did n't hate him or blame him or pity him or anything . It was the nothingness of it that was so awful . For her and for her two sisters . Three girls . Maybe that 's what had stunned him . He who had quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of four . It was her mother who ruled the roost  --  and it was her mother who prophesied a lousy end for the middle daughter . Anyway ... Anyway she wanted something better than Bernie Kagan . She enrolledin the downtown school . She took a course in the Marxist understanding of literature . It was that kind of school . And a course in art appreciation given by M. Alexander Klein . M for Morris . Alex was really the world for her . Even looking back from this distance , she would have to say it : the world . He knew everything , and he shared what he knew with genuine enthusiasm . He would have students over to his house for coffee , and pretty soon she was helpinghim serve the coffee . Love ? How could she explain it ? She believed Alex possessed a fund of knowledge she could draw on the rest of her life . His paint/ings were hanging in uptown galleries . His name appeared in certain magazines . His reputation as a proletarian artist was established . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable world  --  clever people , art , knowledge , the preferable life . And so it was . She did have an interesting life . Alex was considerate , understanding . Wisely , he urged her to forget painting . She became interested in acting . Alex encouraged that , saw possibilities . He was ever on the side of the human potential . Nothing was more important than the individual realizing himself , and the highest form of that realization was to put it all at the service of the working class . Anyway .. . ( Ruth spoke haltingly , fetching for words , but her very stops and starts shaped their own eloquence . ) Anyway . . . How long was it ? A year ? No , longer . Possibly two  --  although it was difficult to say at just what point those patches of feeling had merged into a consistent , recognizable pattern . The confusing thing was that the emergence of something new did n't cancel out the old . It was possible to live with two separate conditions for a long time before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor temporary . Alex was still Alex , and the great values as much worth pursuing as ever , but something had definitely happened . . . " Here , " she said , and in the drained light coming through the half-open transom above the door , Jonas saw her place one hand flat on her stomach , just above the hair line ; " and here "  --  bringing both hands to her breasts . At the time there was no one toward whom this hunger had been directed , and even if there were , then , at the beginning , she probablywould have done nothing about it . Oh , she could well imagine what thoughts Jonas must have had . Well , he was wrong . Even a year ago this would have been impossible ; or at any rate it would n't have happened so quickly . But there was the hunger , every day , every night , living its own life , blind to reason , deaf to pleas , not merely renewing itself each morning when she opened her eyes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unsatisfieddays . Alex could make love to her , and he might as well have been making love to another body , not hers , because hers knew only an increase of hunger even while Alex made love . It was as ifp162her flesh had grown taste buds , and the taste that it craved was not to be had from Alex . . . . Ruth turned on her side and lifted her head . She kissed Jonas on the corner of his mouth , then on his right nipple . She said , " Then you sat next to me that night . " " And I had the taste that delights ? " " Yes . " " Please do n't think I 'm unappreciative , but I do n't believe it . All you saw that night was a big dope who did n't open his mouth . " " I knew you could be the one . " " When did you decide I was ? " " In that Liggett 's , that night we saw Ira in the workshop . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ruth said . " They were big and brown and clean . Your nails were n't so clean , but your skin was . Your skin . I wanted your hands on me . And you were sorry for me . I think I even cried a little . Jonas  --  " " What ? " " Stay with me tonight . " " I could n't . " " Why not ? " " I 'm expected home , " he said . " I thought you said that you 're home when you 're home ; you do n't have to account . " " I know , but for crying out loud , Ruth , how will I explain being out all night ? I mean , there can only be one explanation ... . " So ? " " Well , what am I going to say ? Am I going to tell them that something'scome up . . . ? " " Yes ! " Ruth laughed . " Hah , " Jonas laughed back dryly . Ruth asked , " Ca n't you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any explanations ? You are a grown man . There are men of your age who are married and who have children . I 'm sure your sister will understand . " " What the hell is it with you and my sister ? " Jonas demanded . " Why do you get that sarcastic note in your voice every time you mention her ? "  | " I do n't like the hold she has on you , " Ruth confessed . " Never mind . I wo n't ever say anything against your beloved sister again . I promise . But stay with me . " " Ruth , I ca n't . " " Are you afraid ? " " No , I 'm not afraid . It 's  --  " " It 's what ? " " I have to go to work tomorrow ! " Jonas exclaimed , blindly thinkinghe had stumbled upon a foolproof reason . " It will take you less than fifteen minutes to get to work from here , " Ruth pointed out with cool logic . " But clothes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Do you feel dirty ? " she asked . Lying in the semidarkness , Jonas acted the lolling , cross-eyed helplessness of a punch-drunk fighter . It was funny . No , it was n't funny . It was oppressive and wonderful all at once . Of course she knew what he meant . . . . But did she ? Here was a girl who had broken an engagement , who had broken with her family , who had probably lived with an older man before marrying him , who had sloughed off the customs and demands of one life in order to realize the vision of another  --  why should she understand all this shrinking and fidgeting on his part ? " You have to admit it 's kind of embarrassing , " he said . " Yes , Jonas , " she replied quietly . " It 's terribly embarrassing . " That pierced . " All right , " he said . " Do n't bother , " Ruth said , turning away . Jonas tried to turn her back to him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the vertebra of her spine . He nuzzled against her , and he felt her rigidity soften . He spoke into the dark , springy coils of her hair . " I know it must sound crazy to you , but I 've never spent a night away from home . I 've never been away to a kids ' camp . I 've never spent a night at a friend 's house . It was n't that my father insisted on my being at home every night ; it just happened that way . I 've been trying to think of what to tell them .... " Ruth was silent.  | " May I use your telephone ? " he asked . " Of course you may use my telephone . " Jonas rolled away from Ruth and sat on the edge of the bed . He reached for his shorts , slipped them on , and went to the bathroom . While urinating ( carefully aiming at the side of the bowl to avoid the center splash ) , he experimented with a few attitudes to test whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend who lives in Manhattan . . . . What friend ? Why stay ? What doing ? Jonas ? Jonas ? . . . " Debbie , let me talk to Pa . . . . Pa , I wo n't be coming home tonight . Nothing the matter . Everything is fine . I just did n't want you to worry . What friend ? Do I have to tell you that ? No , he did n't have to tell Solomon that . And he did n't have to tell Debbie that . No flags had to be implanted or entrenchments built for Jonas Gould to claim the full rights of his manhood . He knew he was free to do as he pleased , and this was his fear and his reluctance . What would bind them if each took his portion of liberty and made off with it ? Was anything binding them now ? Where the golden links forged in years of love and need ? So easily struck off ? How could you do this , Debbie ? Do you realize what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be what we were . Everything is changing . Oh , Debbie ! Jonas flushed the toilet . He closed his eyes and leaned against the door of the bathroom . Sorrow squeezed his lungs . He opened his mouth and sucked in air to counter that painful oppressiveness . Then he held out his arms horizontally , full length , palms upward , a despairing salute to freedom too easily won . . . . He snapped off the light and returned to the other room . He telephoned home . Debbie answered . " How 's everything ? " he asked . " Fine , " Debbie said . " Where are you calling from ? " " A friend 's house , " he answered . " Is Pa home ? " " No . He stepped out just a few minutes ago to get some air . Why ? " " Nothing , " Jonas said . " Listen , I wo n't be coming home tonight . " Oh ? "  | " What oh ' ? " " Nothing . I 'm a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you be surprised ? " Jonas asked bitterly . " All right , I 'm not surprised . You 're staying at a friend 's house . I 'll tell Pa . Do I know this friend ? " " No , you do n't , " Jonas said . " I see . " " Debbie  --  " " Yes ? " He was about to say something fantastic . He was about to propose a trade . He would come home tonight if she would break her engagement to Norman . . . . In his nostrils was the salt-and-sun pungency of Solomon 's shoulder as he was carried down to the terrifying sea . . . . No way to stop that jogging ride . " Nothing , " he said . " Did you buy anything ? " " Yes . I finally decided on a kitchen set . Pa likes it , too . " " That 's good . That 's one less thing to worry about . And Pa ? " " What about Pa ? " Debbie asked . " Is he very upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has n't said anything . . . . Jonas , what do you want me to tell him ? Just that you 're staying at a friend 's house ? " " Yes . " " All right . " " I 'll see you tomorrow , Deb . " " Be careful , Jonas . " He replaced the receiver and went to Ruth . He lay down beside her and took her in his arms . For a long time neither spoke . Jonas realized at one point that he must have fallen asleep . The dream was the merest fragment : he and a friend sitting on an old abandoneddock , peering down through the spaces of the splintery planks . In the shadowed , scummy water a blue jellyfish drifted by . . . Ruth moved , and he tried to place that movement within the dream . . . . Then he knew that he had slept . He made love to Ruth again , and as he entered her body he felt the quality of all they had learned about each other become part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and final paroxysms of pleasure.  |p166Ruth  left with him the following morning . They had breakfast in a cafeteria on Forty-second Street . Jonas felt the need for more sleep in the marrow of his bones . Internal yawns rippled the muscles of his stomach . He ate scrambled eggs and sausages . Ruth had tea and a corn muffin . When he had finished , Jonas would have liked to cradle his head on his arms and sleep for hours . " Tired ? " Ruth asked . Jonas nodded . Ruth smiled , catching her lower lip between her teeth . She was sleek with the surfeit that had made his fatigue . Jonas would have liked to say something about this , but it was taking all his energy and coordination merely to keep his head erect . When they left the cafeteria , Jonas bought a paper . Berlin , it said , was still hopeful for peace . . . . Jonas yawned at last , a great shuddering yawn that left him teary-eyed and slightly deaf . He smiled at Ruth . " Think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm as good as you make me , " she said . " Do you realize a war is about to start ? " " Maybe not . " " What 's going to happen to us now ? " he asked . " I do n't know , " Ruth answered . " Will I see you tonight ? " Jonas shook his head . " Tomorrow , " he said . " All right . At the house ? About six ? " He nodded . They were walking toward the subway entrance . When they reached it they touched hands briefly and parted . Jonas walked slowly down the steps . It was a gray day . The temperature had dropped considerably . It looked like rain . A shudder of joy seized Jonas as he realized that autumn was coming . Autumn would be long with its flame and spice and gradual death . And after autumn , winter . . . and after winter , spring ... and Jonas was gorged with the bounty of seasons yet to come.  |p167The  Gould family heard the news at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katowice at five o'clock on the morning of September the first . Debbie and Jonas turned to Solomon , who looked merely reflective . He said , " Have you noticed that Hitler always made some move around the Jewish high holidays ? For the past few years he has celebrated every Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur screaming on the radio . " I 'm sure he was thinking of that , " Debbie said skeptically . " September they gather the harvest . That 's the time to make war . " " And yet  --  " Solomon mused . " I ca n't believe it , " Debbie said . " I just ca n't believe it . " " One man , " said Solomon . " Historians will try to prove later that it was caused by many things , but I 'm telling you now that it 's all the work of one man . " " What 's the difference , " Jonas said . " Maybe it 'll be a quick war . " " No , " Solomon declared , taking on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old . " It wo n't be a quick war . " They finished breakfast . Solomon , as usual , was the first to leave the house . He had to be in the factory before the others to start the machines and correct whatever electrical or mechanical faults would spring from the first turning over of dirty armatures and worn cams . Jonas helped Debbie with the dishes . " Who is she ? " Debbie asked , as she washed . " Who is who ? " Jonas asked . " The girl , " Debbie said . Jonas 's first impulse was simply to deny . That could be so easily done . A mere statement that there was no girl , and that would bep168the end of it . Debbie 's claim on him had been weakened , too . The absolute fealty had ended , and Jonas did n't quite know how to handle the options of independence . On another day he might have shrugged her question away , but bombing planes and invading troops shrank the perspectives of all their lives . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom ? Maybe that 's why wars started , just to change the status of these questions . " Her name is Ruth , " Jonas said , and then added with a smile , " She does n't like you . " " Does n't like me ! " Debbie exclaimed in amazement . " Do I know her ? " " No , " said Jonas . " But I 've told her about you . She thinks I 'm living under your thumb . " Debbie was aghast . She stared at Jonas disbelievingly , uncertain whether he had just made this up , or whether he had indeed told some unimaginably twisted tales about his family . For his part , Jonas was enjoying the scene . He was telling the truth , but the truth was founded on error , and this contradiction gave him sanction and immunity . " What on earth did you tell her ? " Debbie wanted to know . " Well , nothing , really , " Jonas said . " I just told her about the family , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , or meant , or something . " " Jonas , are you telling me the truth ? " " So help me . " " Are you in love with this girl ? " " Sort of . " " Then I wo n't say another word , " Debbie announced with stiff resolution . " Oh , go ahead , Debbie , say another word . After all , I 've said so many words about Norman . I think you have the right . I did n't agree with her , you know . I told her in no uncertain terms she was nuts . But it 's amazing how stubborn women are once they get an idea . " " Nobody gets an idea out of thin air , " Debbie said . " I 'm sure you gave her good reason to think what she thinks . " " You 're wrong , " Jonas said with more equanimity than he everp169could have managed if there was any doubt in his mind . Truth was a sword , even if one used the sword like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for the other woman who has influenced a man 's life . " " Have n't you become the overnight expert on women ! " " What 's the overnight ' mean ? " " Nothing . " " But is n't it true ? " Jonas said . " About women ? " " No , it is n't true , " Debbie retorted . " Just how does this Ruth think I 've influenced your life ? " " Well , she thinks  --  " Jonas broke off with an impatient gesture . " Christ , I do n't know what she thinks . Whatever she thinks , it is n't true , so it does n't matter . " " Does n't it ? " Debbie said . " Does n't it matter that a girl you 've become very friendly with has a false and vicious idea of your sister ? How you 've changed , Jonas ! And you must have told her something ... " " I told her you were a tower of strength in the Gould family .. . and that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for appreciation ? " " You did not , " Jonas said categorically . " And I made that clear to Ruth .... Debbie , for crying out loud , do n't take it so seriously . I was more than half kidding you . The fact is , she does n't know you . I could have been talking about a mother , an aunt , anybody at all . I think she was ready to hate any woman I 've ever known . " " Very likely , " Debbie said . " How old is she ? " " About your age . " " Older than you ? " " Anything wrong in that ? " " It 's not the usual thing . " " I seem to remember you once saying that people should get over their small prejudices . " " Yes , " said Debbie . " Only it 's very discouraging to hear that a person that age has n't outgrown such pettiness . I 'm sure there must be something nice about her . " " But you would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Does she want to get married ? " Debbie asked  | " She is married . " Debbie turned up the volume of water flowing from the spigot . She directed the flow against the sides of the sink . Then she shut the faucet and dried her hands on a dish towel . The expression on her face had changed . She looked no less interested , but the angle of her interest had changed . " Not to you , I assume , " she said . " No , not to me . " " Do you think that 's wise ? " " Probably not . " " Then why do you see her ? " " Oh , you know how these things are , " Jonas replied , growing bored with his man-of-the-world attitude . Suddenly he was not feeling man-of-the-worldish . Discussion with Debbie had blown away the protective vapors surrounding his affair with Ruth , and it stood before him in stark outline . He was not a gay stud with only a hard-on for conscience . He thought of never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of his feeling . He said , " I see her , I guess , because I love her . " " Is she planning to divorce her husband ? " Debbie asked . " She has n't said so . " " You 're not being very smart . " " Well , I did n't think you were being very smart either , so there we are . " " Is that why you told me , to hurt me ? " " I did n't tell you a thing , Debbie . You asked me . And I have no wish to hurt you . Besides , why worry about a little thing like that when there 's a great big war to worry about ? " By invoking that lesser immediacy but perhaps deeper concern , Jonas found and touched with fire the buried nerve of Debbie 's authority . She turned on him , her eyes and voice glinting dangerously . " Do n't you ever dare take that tone with me again , Jonas ! Do you understand ? If you want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take that tone ! I do have some rights , whatever your friend may think of those rights ! I asked you about a girl because I know you 're seeing one , and you could hardly wait to throw all this dirt at me !  |p171What  are you trying to prove ? That you do n't give a damn about my opinion ? That everything will go to pieces the moment I step out of the house ? You overgrown boob ! You rotten kid ! " She had n't wept on many occasions when a more sentimental woman might have , but Debbie did weep now . Her tears scalded Jonas . Her accusations were true . He had thrown shocking things at her with insolence . He did wish to hurt her , and he had succeeded , not with the facts of his involvement , but with his deliberate and childish attempt to demonstrate that his life was no longer her concern . Petulantly and clumsily he had paraded that falsehood , and now that he had at last reached her with it he was horrified at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said he was sorry he had told her all that crap . There was no need to have told her all that crap . It was true , but it was n't nearly as serious as he made it sound . She was not to worry about it . Things had n't gone that far that he could n't easily step out of the situation . .. . " I do n't want you to get into a mess , Jonas , " Debbie said , using a paper napkin on her nose and eyes . " I 'm not trying to control your actions . I just do n't want you to get into one of those horribly messy situations . For your sake . Does Pa know about this ? " " No . . . . And please do n't say anything to him . It 's not that im-portant . " " I have no intention of saying anything to him . " " Look , Debbie , I 'm not going to let things go to pieces , " Jonas said . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your complete freedom , " Debbie said . " I do n't want you to think I 'm leaving Pa to you , that you 're responsiblefor everything . That is n't so . We wo n't be moving to another city . I do n't know yet where Norman and I will live , but wherever it will be , it will be close enough so that we can always be in touch . You and Pa will be able to have dinner with us as often as you 'd like to come . I know things are going to change , but we do n't have to be scattered to the winds . That would break my heart . You do n't know how much I 've worried about it , who will make meals , shop , keep things together . . . . Have you thought about it at all , Jonas ? "  | " Sure I 've thought about it , " Jonas replied . " There 's nothing to it . We 'll have dinner out once or twice a week  --  we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while  --  stag dinner at home  --  and the week 's gone . We Gould men are housebroken . It 's going to work out beautifully . " " Oh , I know you can manage , " Debbie said . She looked at him , her pale eyes appealing from a distance of new recognitions and reconciliations . She asked , " Does she have any children ? " " Who ? Ruth ? God , no ! " " Well , that 's something . " Jonas smiled and shook his head . " Do n't worry about it , " he said again . He looked at the kitchen clock . " I 've got to beat it . " He approached Debbie . She offered her cheek to his kiss . Another cool , overcast day . A somber light . Black , perpendicular steel girders diagonally hatched with supporting bars : the elevated . Buff and brick-red apartment houses drawn with T-square sharpness against the gray sky . The delineations of the street etched themselves on Jonas 's sight with cryptic significance . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how the people looked . But they looked  --  many wearing raincoats , carrying umbrellas  --  no different . Jonas examined their faces , seeking some indeterminate sign of change . This morning 's news had come down like a power knife in Leo Ackerman 's shop , dividing the past from all that would follow with a murderous cut . Something of that should show . A deeper gloom for the world 's tragedy . Heads held a little higher to catch the scent of calamity in the air . . . . Something ! You , sir , would you mind telling us what you 're thinking this very moment ? Would you draw a few figures in the air to show what you 're feeling ? . . . But what was there to show ? Was he showing anything , looking any different ? You do n't walk along shaking your head and clucking your tongue . . . . Let it be noted that on the day the war started my sister cried because I was acting like a shit , and not because bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way people are.  |p173Jonas  bought a newspaper at the usual stand . He climbed the steps to the elevated platform reading the headline : GERMAN ARMY ATTACKS POLAND ; CITIES BOMBED ; PORT BLOCKADED : DANZIG IS ACCEPTED-INTO REICHHe was thrilled . His body broke out in goose flesh . It was a messagehe had waited for , seemingly , his whole life , and the size of its import was commensurate with the long expectancy . There were reasons for feeling the inevitability of this monstrous climax . Somethingin the nature of the past two decades had informed Jonas that his life would proceed only so far , and then he would have to bridge a chasm , traverse a mountain , pass through an altered dimension of time before he could connect with the second half of his life . Rumors had come to him from afar . Armies had massed , blocking his way to any conceivable future . He had not continued in school because school assumed continuity , and he had known in his bones there would be no continuity . The train came and Jonas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He jibbed the paper into the crosscurrent of drafts and began to read with the avidity of a man who had stumbled upon a volume of his own biography . The men in the shop seemed no more affected than the people in the street . They started their machines , turned knurled knobs for adjustment , tested colors , and soon work flowed from between the rollers faster than the eye could follow . At noon Jonas left the shop for lunch . This was Friday , the day Alex was to return from Rochester . Yesterday , Ruth had at last given evidence of some uneasiness . The accelerating world crisis might just bring Alex home a day sooner . And besides she was unwell . She announced this as soon as Jonas kissed her . " Does that mean I should n't kiss you ? " he had asked . " Of course not . I just want you to know . I do n't want you to be disappointed . " " I do n't know what you think I am . I do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " I know . . . but I did n't want you to start if it would lead no-where . " At that he had laughed aloud . " And what if it led nowhere ? I have a lot of experience in it leading nowhere . " " Why be frustrated . I do n't want you frustrated . " " A little frustration wo n't kill me . " " Well , I do n't like it . " " You do n't like what ? " " I do n't like you getting excited and  --  and  --  " " I thought you did like me getting excited . " " Not if I ca n't do anything about it . " " The mechanism works both ways , " he told her . " On and off . " " But it 's such a waste ! " Again he had laughed . Waste , for the love of God ! What a joke ! The damn thing led a life of its own , rearing itself causelessly , embarrassingly , without apparent regard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only abundance he had ever known ! But on reflection he realized that her solicitude was n't solely for his condition . The waste she spoke of might be one she was feeling in corresponding parts : a vaginal pathos that mourned every unused erection as an irrecoverable loss . They had gone to a movie , and when they came out they had walked in the quiet east-side streets toward Ruth 's apartment . Ruth said perhaps it would be best if he did n't come up tonight . She was feeling nervous . Jonas agreed . They walked a little farther in silence , and then Ruth tugged at his arm , drawing him into the empty freightway of an office building . There she put her arms around him and kissed him in a loving but circumspect way . She avoided any suggestive contact below . " Do you love me ? " she had whispered . " Yes . " " You 'd better not phone tomorrow . " " All right . " " But you will call on Monday ? " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes and leaned against him . As they were leaving the freightway , Jonas saw a red glow in ap175dark corner of the loading platform . The cigarette formed a brief circle of illumination in which the eyes of an elderly Negro betrayed nothing more than having witnessed the scene . Jonas smiled and said nothing to Ruth , who obviously had n't seen . They had parted on Fifth Avenue . Jonas kept on walking ; Ruth turned into the side street . A day , even several days , of not being in touch with Ruth had caused him no trouble before , but on this Friday , after finishing his lunch , the urge to contact her was almost irresistible . But she had specifically warned against it , so Jonas bought an afternoon paper , whose headlines were sufficiently blaring to divert him . He thought of phoning Ira instead . He would say , " Well , what do you think ? " But Ira would rightly think him a jackass for the call and the question . What was there to think any longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , that was just a compensating gesture . It was n't Ira he wanted to talk to ; it was Ruth . Not that he would have been better able to express his feelings to her . But the need had little to do with logic . To talk to Ruth now would be to make contact with himself in a way only she had made possible . Only she had given him a vision of Jonas Gould that he had at best only guessed at before . Only she had given him a singlenesshe could never have acquired alone . She had made him feel the value of his mere existence , and this was Ivlallomars and milk to the soul . Insensibly he enjoyed the taste of it when he was with her , and now he found himself missing it sorely when he was not . It was a feeling that turned and directed itself outward to its source , Ruth , and the curve of this passage touched to life sensations to which he refused to give a name . But they were there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown from a grafting of the two . The men were finishing their lunch when Jonas returned . Marcus , Zimmerman , and Keller , full-fledged pressmen and an elite within the shop , ate apart from the rest . Keller was of German descent . Overhearing snatches of their conversations from time to time , Jonas was able to make out that their concern was almost exclusively with union matters . Their lunchtime huddles gave them an aura of conspiratorial harmony . Leo Ackerman called them the " funferers. "  |p176Jonas  saw them now in a different arrangement as he passed by on his way to the washroom . Keller , a thin man with a perpetually harried look in his blue eyes , sat on a folding chair and examined the floor in his immediate vicinity , left to right , as if he were looking for something he had dropped . From a distance he gave the appearance of fresh Alpine health , the pink-checked glow Europeans retain long after immigration . But Keller was born in America , and on closer observation one saw that it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flush . Zimmerman was squat , solid , a smaller version of his boss , Ackerman . He wore a blue workshirt whose sleeves had been cut right to the shoulder seam . His hairy wrists were as thick as the thick end of a baseball bat . He sat looking at his stomach . " I only said  --  " Jonas heard Keller say . " Listen , he 's right , " Marcus said to Zimmerman . Marcus , foreman and union representative , was obviously mediatingsome dispute between Zimmerman and Keller . Zimmerman threw Marcus a quick , smoldering glance . " A man does n't like to hear such words about his own flesh and blood , " Keller said , addressing the floor . " I got at least a dozen  --  " Zimmerman suddenly shot up from his chair , his face dark with angry blood . His roar brought up heads all over the shop . " I do n't give a shit how many relatives you got in Germany ! You hear ! I said it , and I 'll say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I hope they kill every dirty rotten Nazi bastard ! Your relatives ! Every one ! Not one should be left living ! Nothing but ashes should be left from your fucking Germany and your fucking Hitler ! " " My relatives are not Nazis ! " Keller shouted from his sitting position . " Every goddam German is a Nazi ! Murderers every one ! " " Jew liar ! " Jonas saw Zimmerman dart a glance at a workbench on which was lying a ball-peen hammer . He snatched it up . Anticipating the move as if he had been handed a blueprint of the scene , Jonas took one step and plucked the hammer out of Zimmerman 's hand . " You crazy , Zimmerman ! " Marcus yelled  |p177Others  milled around . " You heard the son of a bitch ! " Zimmerman foamed . " I want this dirty Nazi bastard thrown out of the union ! Whose side are you on , Marcus ? " " Zimmerman , you called him names first , " Marcus said . " You wished the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nazis ! " thundered Zimmerman , beside himself . The pressure of long-capped fury and frustration rushed upward like a geyser . Years of it . Fritz Kuhn and the Bundists . Father Coughlin . Social Justice . Newspapers , radio , and bad dreams .... " Every German is a Nazi , and if you 're on his side you 're a Nazi , too ! They want to kill me ! I 'll kill them ! I 'll show you , you son of a bitch ! I wo n't work in the same shop with a Nazi ! Me or him ! One or the other ! Where 's Ackerman ? . . . Ackerman ! " Ackerman was there , watching . The commotion had brought him from the office . " Keller , go in the men 's room , will you , " he ordered . " Go wash . Take a leak . Zimmeinian , come with me . " Zimmerman followed Ackerman into the office . The work bell rang . The machines started up . Keller came out of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , Zimmerman emerged from Mr. Ackerman 's office , black with rage . He strode straight to the lockers , changed his clothes , and made for the exit . Halfway across the shop , he turned and pointed a finger at Marcus . " You , too ! " he shouted . " You have n't heard the last ! And Ackerman ! Nazi sympathizers ! " He turned and charged out . That afternoon Mr. Ackerman called Jonas into the office . " Close the door behind you , " he said . " Sit down . I promised you a raise . " " Yes , sir . " " I did n't forget about it . It 'll be in your envelope today . It 's not twenty dollars . Only ten . " Ten was five more than Jonas had hoped for . " Thank you very much , Mr. Ackerman , " he said.  |p178Mr  . Ackerman nodded . He had something else on his mind . Everybody had something on his mind this first day of September , nineteen hundred and thirty-nine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mr. Ackermansaid . " Yes , sir . I do . " " So what do you think ? " Jonas hesitated . What did he think ? Leo Ackerman 's strategies were Leo Ackerman 's sport , and Jonas did n't mind playing the game , but he was always at a disadvantage . Everybody suffered that disadvantage with Leo Ackerman . Leo had thought it all out before , and then he invited someone else into the game as though he had invented it on the spur of the moment . What did he think of what ? To ask the question would produce a lordly shake of the head . Today a war started ; one worker almost brained another ; and Leo Ackerman was asking Jonas Gould riddles about the greetingcardbusiness ! " I think it 's a great idea , " Jonas said . " You do ? Why ? " " Greeting cards , " Jonas said . " People buy them by the million . " " What 's going to happen ? " Mr. Ackerman asked . " Here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , " said Mr. Ackerman , his brown eyes applauding Jonas 's acuteness . " We 'll probably get in the war , " Jonas said . " Sooner or later . " " And what happens if we do ? " " We 'll win . " " Your father should be proud of you , " Mr. Ackerman said . " He is , " said Jonas . " And how long will it take to win ? " " A year . A year and a half . " Leo Ackerman stroked himself under the chin . Jonas wondered if Mr. Ackerman 's father had had a beard . It was the stroke of a man with a beard . Or possibly it was Leo Ackerman wishing away one of his several chins . " Or two years , " Mr. Ackerman said . " Or five . " " Maybe . "  | " So you would go into the greeting - card business ? " " No ? " Jonas asked . " What do you use in the printing business ? " Mr. Ackerman asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ink ? " said Jonas . " Machines ? Paper ? " " Paper , " said Mr. Ackerman . " What happens to paper in war-time ? " " I do n't know , Mr. Ackerman . What happens to paper in war-time ? " " Paper is rationed in wartime . I 'm surprised you do n't know that . Is this a time to go into the greeting-card business ? " " Absolutely not ! " " Yes , " said Mr. Ackerman softly . " I think you ought to take back that raise , " Jonas said in mock despair . Mr. Ackerman grunted . He said , " If you go into the greeting-card business , you have to buy paper . That does n't mean you have to use all you buy . You hold some . . . . Listen , I 'm buying a plant in Long Island City . It 's bigger than I wanted , but maybe eventually I 'll move everything over there . If you want government contracts , you have to have the plant . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be working for such a smart , farsighted man ? . . . What are you looking at me for ? It 's not nice ? It 's materialistic ? Unpatriotic ? Your father would n't like it ? You cockamamie ! What do you think General Motors and Ford and U.S. Steel are doing right now ? " " I did n't say anything , " Jonas said , knowing very well that he did . It was wondrous strange how many directions the human heart could leap . " I think you 're a genius , Mr. Ackerman . " Mr. Ackerman raised his head and one finger . " Do n't get smart , " he warned . " Because I give you the privilege to sit at my feet and learn , that does n't give you the right to take liberties . . . . Monday is Labor Day , so on Tuesday I want you to go out to the plant . I 'll tell you how to get there . I want you to ask for Mr. Whiting . He expects you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be running back and forth myself all the time . I want you to keep your eyes open . Take your own inventory . The machines , the plates , thep180paper , the chemicals , the inks . I want to see how observant you are . All right ? " " All right , " Jonas said , now thoroughly caught up in the deepdyeddoings of Ackerman , the entrepreneur . Because it was Leo 's pleasure to keep a half-dozen circus-striped balls spinning in the air all the time , there was a tendency to lose sight of the fact that the hands performing the trick were professionaland sure . " I understand you saved Keller a broken skull , " Mr. Ackerman said . " I did n't see it myself , but one of the men told me . You move fast . Tell me , Jonas , do you always move so fast ? " " Not always , " Jonas replied . " I just happen to be good with hammers . " " And best with your own . . . . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Almost more than I can use . " Mr. Ackerman shifted in his chair . His eyes became soft , mendicant . " So tell me , " he said . " Tell you what ? " Jonas asked , then shifted uneasily . " Come on now , Mr. Ackerman . It is n't gentlemanly to talk about things like that . " " I agree , " said Mr. Ackerman . " I respect your feelings , and if I respect your feelings , I 'm already half a gentleman . Frankly , Jonas , the other half of me is curious . Maybe you 'll understand what I mean when I say I 've been a fat man for a long time . They had to take my wife 's insides out after my daughter was born . This does n't mean that a woman ca n't enjoy sex , but it just so happens that my wife never enjoyed sex . There are women like that . I know you think I 'm just teasing you , that I 'm a dirty old man , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine , respectful curiosity . Would it hurt you once in a while to share your pleasure with poor Leo Ackerman ? " Jonas was touched . And repelled . He kept his gaze fixed on the onyx desk set , whose pen he had never seen Mr. Ackerman remove from its holder . " How can you share something like that ? " he asked . " Does your girl friend enjoy it ? " fat Leo asked , quite humbly.  | " Yes , " said Jonas . " Very much ? " " Yes . " " How do you know ? " " I just know . There are signs . " " What signs ? " " Well  --  the way she moves , the sounds she makes . " Leo Ackerman moved . Leo Ackerman made a sound . " Nnh . " He asked , " What sounds ? " " Oh-h . . . she cries . " " Cries ? You mean tears ? When she comes ? " " Yes . " " Mr. Ackerman nodded slowly . He gripped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle , massive transport . " Is she pretty , Jonas ? " he asked . " Yes , " Jonas replied , understanding a little the need he was feeding . " Very pretty . " " Ah-hah . Listen , when you see her the next time give her a kiss for me . A harmless kiss from a fat man . You see , Jonas , no wise cracks , no dirt . . . . All right . Thank you . I will respect your confidence . ... Now do n't forget , Tuesday , go straight to the plant in Long Island City . . . . " Mr. Ackerman gave Jonas directions . The news broadcasters that evening sounded deep notes of destiny . Orotund . Bassoons and oboes . Then they were finished , and the commercial programs came on . It was shocking to listen to " Easy Aces " and " Mr. Keen " after the news . Shocking and disappointing . One wanted to go on listening endlessly to opinion . Everybody'sopinion . Anybody 's opinion . . . . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today was my last day at Dubin 's , " he announced . Debbie , who was at the sink , turned around . " You quit ? " she asked . " I quit , " Solomon said . " Why ? Oh , Pa , for God 's sake , why ? Why now ? " " Debbie , this has nothing to do with you . Do n't mix your affairsp182with mine . I refuse to go on working for a dishonest man . You see what happens when you accept a little evil at a time . " " What does one thing have to do with the other ? " Debbie asked . " It 's such a melodramatic comparison . " " Please do n't teach me , Debbie , " Solomon rumbled in his deepest bass . " I live according to my own views , you live according to yours . I never had to apologize for my actions to your mother . " " " Norman and I are planning to get married in November ! " Debbie flung at her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can I leave you alone in the house now , with only Jonas to take care of you ? " Solomon sat erect . His hands came down heavily on the table . " I can take care of myself , " he said , his voice almost indistinct in its hoarseness . " Go get married , Debbie . Quickly . I do n't want anything bad between you and me . Go get married and be happy . But do n't instruct me . Do n't make me say things I 'll be sorry for . Jonas will not have to take care of me . " He tapped the tips of his bunched fingers against his chest . " You may have a new ideal of manhood , but I still respect the person that I am . And when I do n't any longer , I know exactly what to do . " " Now cut it out , both of you ! " Jonas put in vehemently . To Debbie he said , " Lay off , Deb . Let it go . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence invaded the Gould apartment . Debbie retired to her room ; Solomon to his . Jonas went into the living room  --  his room  --  listening to more evening news , getting up from time to time and going into the kitchen to get a peach , some grapes , a plum , and stopping in transit to listen for signs of repentant life . But there was no movement , no sound . It did seem to Jonas that his father 's action was foolish and vain , a ridiculously puny gesture measured against the enormity of events . One would think that the slightest sense of proportion would have prevented a man of intelligence from making it . Still Jonas felt loyalty , all the more strong , perhaps , for the foolishness he recognized . And the idea of Solomon and Debbie not talking to each other was just intolerable . . . . Jonas got up from the sofa and walked through the narrowp183vestibule , taking a stand between the two closed doors of the bedrooms . " I 'm making a fresh pot of coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to bring a cup into each of your rooms , or will you join me inside . I invite you . Please visit me . I want harmony in this family , do you understand ? I 'm the youngest . I have rights . " Then he went to the kitchen . He heard doors open . Debbie 's first , by the footsteps . Then Solomon 's . It would never be difficult to heal a breach between Solomon and Debbie . There was too much memory and too much love . But neither would they ever be the same . They were already traveling different paths , had been doing so for some time . They all were . Jonas felt as if he were chewing the coffee he measured into the percolator.  |p184Deborah  Gould and Norman Prager were married on the last Sunday in November . The weather was seasonable . It was a morning affair . The ceremony was over by one o'clock ; then followedcocktails and dancing to a six-piece band ; then " lunch " ; and by five o'clock the bride and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they were to catch a train to Washington , D.C.Neither Debbie nor Norman had ever been to the nation 's capital before . Norman 's firm thought a one-week honeymoon more than sufficient for these times , and one week shrank the geographical ambitions of a honeymooning couple . Therefore Washington , repositoryof the nation 's history and heritage , and of course a week 's plenitude of free sight-seeing . Monuments and buildings , museums and libraries , institutes and the broad grandeur of streets . It was a happy idea , considering . Not everything had been happy about the preparation of Debbie 's wedding . Solomon was not a man to spin fantasies about his daughter'swedding , but he could easily detect the look and feel of something he did n't like . " Simple , " he said . " Could n't it be simple ? " " It will be , " Debbie assured him , herself not fully aware of her father 's conception of simplicity . Solomon had in mind a dignified little ceremony with perhaps fifteen or twenty people present , a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of the better restaurants that had special rooms for such occasions . Debbie was , after all , the bride , and the bride 's family 's circumstances and taste were usually reflected in the wedding . He had n't reckoned with the Pragers.  | " They have a very large family , " Debbie explained . " We have a small one , " Solomon countered . " As to the expense  --  " she ventured cautiously . Solomon looked at his daughter loweringly . " I wo n't believe it , " he said . " Not even from them . They would dare ? " " Pride , Pa ? False pride ? " " Whose pride ? " Solomon demanded . " I want to do what I can . They want something else . I have false pride ? " Debbie became an increasingly harassed intermediary between her father and her future in-laws , trying to effect a compromise between the two . Mrs. Prager , who could n't believe that Mr. Gould 's stubbornness was anything more than the result of faulty communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all . She spoke to Solomon on the phone . What was so difficult to understand ? They had a large family . You invited one , you invited everybody . You invitedeverybody , you had to have the place . You had the right place , you had to have the right arrangements . As to the money . . . " I want you to know , Solomon , we look on Debbie like on our own . No difference ! And , believe me , her own mother , she should rest in peace , would want Debbie to have a wedding she will remember . I want this as much for your dear wife 's sake as for my own . " Mrs. Prager was a shrewd lady . After the first capitulation on the size of the wedding , the rest was a distant rumble of alien machinery . The Pragers knew a hall in Brooklyn  --  perfect ! They had been to weddings there , and they knew it to be cheerful , roomy , tasteful , right . The nature of the ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform rabbi , but a man as much moved by the times as by the traditions of religion . A small band . For dancing . Who ever heard of a wedding without dancing ? . . . Debbie showed Solomon the luncheon menu . " Should n't you advise the guests to eat a light breakfast ? " he asked . " It looks like more than it actually is , " she said . " All right , Debbie . " " Pa , I know you think this is all terribly vulgar , but every practicalconsideration is a little vulgar . The old aristocratic familiesp186were every bit as practical about these arrangements . The bridegroom'sprospects , the bride 's dowry . .. . " I have about two thousand dollars for you , Debbie , " Solomon told her . " I wish it was ten times as much . However you and Norman wish to divide it is all right with me . Whatever the Pragers think should be my contribution to the wedding , take it . The rest is your dowry . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " No , I do n't wash my hands of it , " Solomon replied . " Do you want me to pretend that this Prager wedding is with my consent and approval ? I 'm afraid I ca n't . Not even for you . I do n't know why you say I think these arrangements are vulgar . I do n't think they 're vulgar . A nice wedding is not vulgar . A large wedding is not vulgar . To talk of dowries is not vulgar . What I find vulgar are people who never for a second seriously considered my wishes . Tell me the truth , Debbie , did they ever say , Perhaps for Solomon Gould 's sake , to oblige him , we should have a small wedding ? ' Did they ever hint at such a thing ? The truth . " Debbie averted her eyes . No , they had never said anything of thesort , or even hinted at it in the full-blown panoply of their planning . But the heavy guns were all on their side . Theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon her entrance into that milieuas the true resplendence of her marriage . In peering into the future , she saw no vaulted halls but a warm multitude of rooms peopled by , brothers and sisters , aunts and uncles and cousins , all of them on Norman 's side . She had indulged in a lonely girl 's yeasty vision of birthdays and weddings , births and confirmations and even deaths . In the center of her vision , radiant and symbolic , stood a telephone which would bring the many voices Deborah Gould had lacked in her life . Voices that would ask nothing more than , " How are you , Debbie ? How 's Norman ? That 's good . We want you to come to dinner on Friday night . " She , like the Pragers , had no desire to offend these desirable voices . She , like the Pragers , had refused to see the diminution of Solomon in the Prager-sized wedding . She had allowed herself to think of her father 's wishes as another flourish of the tattered banner that had carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinded herself to what she knew : that Solo/mon 's style was Solomon , and that to deny him his style , to refuse him , as he put it , a second 's serious consideration , was to reduce man , style , and all the years to an empty gesture . Solomon had n't wanted a small wedding out of a poverty of means or spirit , but as an expression of the enclosed , singular life that fate and his own values had fashioned . Debbie felt sick at heart . She had undertaken one mission too many . It was true that the Pragers did n't quite know how to approachSolomon on the matter of money . Solomon was a queer duck . They feared a worsening of the tensions that had sprung up over the wedding . Mother and father consulted with Norman . - Norman consulted with Debbie . It was not the money itself  --  really and truly it was n't  --  and had things not gone as they had they might have left Solomon out of the reckoning entirely , but to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Debbie understood the awkwardness . She felt it herself . In raising the subject of money as diplomatically as she knew how , she saw herself regrettably but precisely in the middle . Solomon 's quick response to her hint revealed to her that she was wrong , that her position had changed , that she was far on the side of the Pragers . " I suppose , " she said , " it 's a matter of whose need is greater . On our side there 's only you who feels strongly about it . I do n't think Jonas cares one way or the other . And they have all those relatives . They would have to spend the rest of their lives apologizing and explaining . " " And you , Debbie ? " Solomon asked . " What do you want ? " For his sake , she said , " I would have been just as happy with a small wedding . " It was true . But she also shared the horror of the Pragers in facing relatives inexplicably and unforgivably excluded from Norman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swelling volume of that indignation . She added , " You speak of obliging . There are more people on that side to oblige . " Solomon nodded . " When it comes to numbers , " he said , " there will always be more people on the other side to oblige . It 's too late now , Debbie , but I warn you for the future : you can give up too much by obliging . "  |p188Debbie  was too spent to explain that she knew this , but that this time she was willing to oblige . She wanted to merge , not stay apart , not be different , as the Goulds had more or less always been different . When the rabbi had finished the seven benedictions , Debbie lifted her veil and sipped from the goblet held by the rabbi . Her olive skin contrasted richly with the white tulle . Norman looked pale and intense in his light-colored tortoise-shell glasses , his freshly barbered hair , his tuxedo . He had followed each step of the ceremony with proprietary interest , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonas looked on the proceedings from the cortege that had accompanied the bridal pair to the huppah . With the others , he had stepped away when the rabbi took over , but he still had a clear view of the bride and bridegroom 's faces . He was the " best man . " Norman had asked him to perform this role , and Jonas had accepted with the same feeling of propitiation that had prompted Norman 's request : to balance the preponderance of Pragers ; to erase the past ; as an earnest of the future . Jonas , too , wore a tux ; a rented one ; his first . Instead of the ridiculously costumed figure he had expected to find in the mirror , he was confronted by a Jonas Gould of sudden maturity and poise . He looked older . He was changed , and in the change he could see aspects of himself that he had never seen before . He might be the collection of oddly jumbled parts his mind conceived , but he was also the particularpresence who was a stranger to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was left completely unchanged by the clothes he wore . So it seemed to Jonas . What Jonas thought of as nondescriptremained proof against the charm of clothing . Norman was Norman . His tux , his shirt , his black bow tie composed one kind of formality . Norman himself composed another . There was no amalgamation . Jonas handed over the ring at the prescribed moment . Norman slipped it on Debbie 's right index finger in keeping with the tradition , then transferred it to the conventional finger . At the conclusionp189of the ceremony , Norman brought his shoe down hard on the glass wrapped in a hand towel , an assertive whomp . To Jonas it appeared that his brother-in-law was smashing all the doubts and inadequaciesthat had haunted him during his courtship of this girl , his bride . Mazel tov ! . . . Mazel tov ! At the wedding table , Solomon sat to Debbie 's left , and Jonas sat beside Solomon . Next to Jonas were seated Aunt Selma and Uncle Nat , who had driven from Hartford in their Chevy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sat among the guests . There were four people from the office where Debbie had worked for so many years ; some old friends from school ; and three ladies who had once been friends of the bride 's mother . They had wept during the ceremony , remembering the sweet , self-effacing woman whose double they swore Debbie had grown to be . Solomon had invited two of his chess cronies and their wives . He also had sent an invitation to a relative living in Philadelphia , but there had been no reply , which was what he had expected . The Gould contingent was a handful . There were well over a hundred people sitting at the tables . Norman and Debbie danced the first waltz . Norman was stiff , but surprisingly light on his feet . He moved through the one-two-three , one-two-three rhythm with the same sedulousness that had marked all his actions at the wedding  --  and before  --  indeed ever since Deborah Gould had consented to be his wife . Jonas was aware of this new state in Norman , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It came to him at last that Norman of the fountain pens and free city museums had been lifted to a higher plane of being ; that Debbie had wrought something of a miracle ; that Norman was being the utmost man he could be  --  and if this was still less than admirable in Jonas 's eyes , Jonas was ready to admit that his eyes were prejudiced . Solomon left the table and walked out on the floor to dance with his daughter . He waltzed in a stolid , heavy-footed circle , looking like a tribal chief observing other customs . " You should dance with your sister now , " said Mildred , Norman 's sister , who had come over to whisper in his ear.  |p190Jonas  walked out on the floor , and Solomon gladly yielded to his son . Then others began to dance . Debbie was fragrant with appleblossom . It came from her hair , her shoulders . It wreathed her , that fragrance . Jonas put himself under the holy oath to behave now in a way that would redeem him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confounded him . He had to struggle with the boy whose heart had climbed its rib cage in terror because his sister was going " out . " He took refuge in his height to avoid looking directly at Debbie . His eyes would meet hers quickly , and then would flee elsewhere . He was pelted with a disorder of memories . Breakfasts and dinners . Hartford . Homework under the circle of light . Birthdays . He saw the apartment in a stopactionflash , such as isolates and makes permanent the record of human joys and griefs , and the pressure of pastness condensed all the rooms into an essence that would live apart from the rooms he and Solomon would inhabit in the days to come . " It could n't be nicer , " he said to Debbie . " You look beautiful . " " We 're going to take more photographs later , " she said . " I want apicture of you in that tuxedo . All the girls are looking at you . Youlook so handsome . . . . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , you mean Norman 's sister . Yes . She looks fine . " " She likes you , " Debbie said . " Let 's stick to your wedding , " Jonas said . " Jonas , please do n't get into trouble . " " Do n't wont ' . I wo n't . " Mr. Prager , the elder , tapped Jonas on the shoulder . " Please , young man , she 's my daughter-in-law now . " After Debbie and Norman had changed into other clothes and had left in a taxi for Penn Station , the wedding guests departed . Solomon tried to persuade the Hartford branch of the family to spend the night in New York , as guests of the Goulds , but with thanks Nat Rothenberg declined . He had to be in the market at six o'clock in the morning . They had their Chevy . A couple of hours , and they were in Hartford . The Pragers wanted Solomon and Jonas to come to their house , which was not far , and now it was Solomon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these clothes . Norman 's brother . Arthur , drove them to Borough Hall , where they took a subway home . The eleven-o'clock news was n't good . The Germans had bombed the British North Sea fleet . German aircraft had sown so many mines around the approaches to London 's port that all shipping had to be rerouted . Currents of silence flowed from that corner of the apartment which was Debbie 's room . Solomon and Jonas sat in the living room and listened to that silence and to the news of war.  |p192abits  continue . The cleaning woman continued to come once a week , and Solomon and Jonas continued in their practiceof dusting and vacuuming between times . Dishes were not left in the sink . Solomon brought home fruits in season , as Debbie had done , and although some of them rotted he replenished the supply , as though not to do so would open a door to the kind of dereliction Debbie had feared . Jonas even continued to set mousetraps , but he often forgot to look to see if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since returning from her honeymoon . She found things quite satisfactory , recommending only that the bed sheets be changed every week . Fresh sheets gave a fresh turn to each week : a psychological necessity . Fresh sheets and fresh fruits and a regimen of cleanliness maintaineda semblance of the life Jonas had known . He was n't lonely  --  indeed he was more occupied than he had ever been before  --  but each time he entered the apartment there came at him ( along with the ghost of Debbie 's appleblossom , which he could n't be sure he actually smelled or conjured seance-like in his imagination ) a quality of silence that brushed his senses so teasingly that he often slipped in quickly and noiselessly , listening intently , as though to take it unawares and perhaps discover its meaning . It was the most evanescent of surface tensions , breaking at the whisper of his own breathing , leaving him with the blank familiarity of furniture that had hurriedly conspired to keep its secret . The secret was one he learned in time , at odd moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was doing some routine thing , reading or passing through the rooms on his way out . Then , out of ap193corner of his mind 's eye , he would catch a spectral glitter of that surface tension hovering over a chair or a table or a whole room , and a hollowness would carve itself in his heart . He thought at first he was only being reminded of Debbie , but reminders of Debbie had their own solid impacts , easily recognized and easily rationalized . This was different . The message was from the objects themselves . A plaintiveness seemed to emanate from a chair , a table , as if they had lost contact with that continuity which makes the things of a home part of the mortal rhythm . Separated from that continuity , they had become mere pieces of wood . He had consigned them to that fate , and their secret was no more than his realization that he had done so . The element that had made these objects a part of time was drawn from them when Debbie left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , or interest , or love , or whatever was required to restore that element . Several times during the autumn months , while the weather still permitted , Jonas had played handball , and while playing had spotted Ira 's head above the parapet . After the games , they had walked along the wide street , then empty of sunning citizens , and had talked of the war . Its coming seemed to have settled some of the ferment in Ira . He told Jonas that clowning around had to stop somewhere short of universal disaster .... " Besides , " he had said , " the woods are full of third-rate comedians . " Jonas had refrained from saying that Ira was not third-rate , although he suspected that the other would even now listen with glum gladness to what needed no telling . They did n't go into Manhattan during those few , smoky , deciduous afternoons in October and November , but stayed rather in the Gould apartment , which Ira liked to do , listening to the Philharmonic , drinking coffee , talking . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatre crowd , all those hopeful and hopeless ones . " You do n't ever see them , do you ? " he asked . " Which ones ? " Jonas asked , taken with a sudden strong need to talk of himself . " Oh , any of them , " Ira returned . " No , you would n't . You have no interest in that crowd , do you ? "  | " In the crowd , no , " Jonas said . " I see Ruth . " " Ruth ? Ruth Klein ? " " Yes . " Ira regarded him in puzzlement for a moment , then shook his head . He gave a little snort of laughter . " When did that begin ? " he asked . " Way back , " Jonas told him . " Seems like way back . July . " " And it 's still going strong ? " " Seems to . " " She want to divorce Alex ? " " I do n't know . She has n't said anything about that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he did n't know , and in truth he did n't . He did n't know ' what to make of his feelings . He had been " in love " once , and what he felt for Ruth was n't at all like that remembered condition . She was still living in the same place , that girl he had been in love with ; a private house no more than a hundred yards from where he and Ira were sitting . He had never spoken to her once throughout his enchantment , but he had seen her from time to time . Once in a bicycle shop , where they had both gone to hire a bike for the day . Once coming out of a local movie house . And once he had passed her as she waited on the stoop of her house , dressed in a tennis outfit , obviously waiting for someone . . . . He had fallen in love with her , and had dreamed of her , and had carried her image about in his head as celebrants in religious parades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustained that love for perhaps two weeks , and it was as if he had contracted a strange disease full of fevers and mesmeric trances that left him so invaded and possessed that when it ended  --  as suddenly and miraculously as it had begun  --  he felt the restoration of his own being as he might have felt the restorationof strength after a long and debilitating illness . There were times when he did feel himself falling in love with Ruth in that way , but these times occurred , oddly , not in her presencebut when he was alone and was able to infuse the mood with blue moondrops of pure longing , the deadly brew of that former affliction . Actually , however , he was with Ruth quite often , and thenp195the feeling turned into something else . Their arrangements were of necessity too practical and Ruth 's sexual bossiness too forthright for the maintenance of that gossamer dream state . " And does Alex know ? " Ira asked . " He 's not supposed to , " Jonas said . " Ruth says not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Ira nodded and for long seconds sat silent with his new knowledge . " Is it still fun ? " he asked at last . " Fun ? " " More pleasure than pain ? " " Sure . " " Do n't get too guilty about it , " Ira then said , and rose , and claimed that he had reams of reading he must do , but as a parting shot assured Jonas , " Your secret 's safe with me . Do n't worry . And for Christ sake do n't fall in love with Ruth , if you really have n't yet . " " Why not ? " Jonas asked . " Because she 's in love already . Has been . Will be . Always . " Jonas understood . " She says no , " he said . " So do I , " said Ira , and waved so long as he went out the door . Jonas did n't see or hear from Ira for months . He phoned his home and was told by Mrs. Hirsch that Ira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time for subway travel . She gave Jonas the telephone number of Ira 's room , but Jonas did n't use it . From the beginning there had been in their friendship an imbalancewhich Jonas accepted as he accepted the other disparities between them . To Jonas it had always seemed a terminal friendship , one that would last only as long as the need that fostered it . The need was Ira 's : to find and cling to someone free of those fears that obsessed him : and Jonas , in his own health , assumed those fears would one day vanish , or that Ira would find someone else to supportthem . Part of the imbalance , then , was Jonas 's granting to Ira the prerogative of ending their friendship when it had outlived its usefulness.  |p196And  in the long intervals between contacts , Jonas assumed that it had ended . But Ira always did contact him . He contacted him one Sunday afternoon toward the end of February , a bitterly cold day . " You playing handball today ? " Ira asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And how the hell are you ? I have n't heard from you in months . " " I 'm all right , " Ira said . " Learning all about bones and glands . You know , like a doctor . " " Do you like it ? Are you finding it interesting ? " " Fascinating . . . . What are you doing today ? " " Nothing . " " " You sound different , " Ira remarked . " Are you different ? " " No , " Jonas said . " Same lump . I do n't know . Maybe a little different . My sister 's married , you know . " " I know . Are you lonely ? " " No , I 'm not lonely , for Christ sake . " " Then you do n't need me . " " Do n't be a jerk , Hirsch . Are you doing anything right now ? Why do n't you come over ? There 's nobody in the house . Just me . " " Maybe I 'll do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty minutes . He looked all but lost in his bulky gray overcoat . He was hatless , and even as he entered the apartment he burrowed into the protection of his coat , like a small animal seeking warmth . He had risked only his nose against the brutal afternoon , and the skin stretched across the bony ridge was a blanched bruise and all the rest a cold-smarting pink . One clear drop of moisture depended from the flange of one nostril . Ira sniffed and blotted his nose with the sleeve of his coat . Beneath the coat he wore a heavy cardigan sweater , despite which he looked thinner than Jonas remembered . His face had drawn itself more tightly behind the prominence of nose . He kept wringing the cold from his fingers . " My parents , " he said , walking into the Gould living room , taking off his overcoat and tossing it on a chair , " are newspaper readers . The Times and the Trib are delivered every Sunday . They start after breakfast , my father on the Times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch . About this time of the day , I expect the roof andp197walls to go flying away in an explosion of silence gas . What are you doing with your life ? " " Living , " Jonas said . " Working , eating , screwing . " " Sounds like a balanced life . " Ira studied Jonas . " I think things have changed for you , " he said . " But you do n't look any different . Does n't the season make any difference to you ? Mallomars and milk . You still look like you 've been playing handball in the sun . " " How 's school ? " Jonas asked . " Grand . " " Yeah ? " Ira sat down in the armchair . He looked around the room as if to match these objects against his memory of them . He sat well forward in the chair , both arms extended downward between his legs . " I 'm dying , " he said . " By inches . By feet . By yards . I 'm not interested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jonas said . " I ca n't . " Why not ? " " I ca n't . " " Your father ? " " Yes . I want him to say , Go ahead . Be what you want ' " " Why the hell do you need him to say it ? " Ira bent over like a man with a severe stomach cramp . " Because I want to be rid of him once and for all , " he moaned . " He 's never acknowledged me , but he 's got to be aware of me before I leave . I 'm not going to walk out of that house as if neither one of us ever existed . . . . Jonas , let me stay here a few hours , will you ? Please ? " " Stay here all night if you want . " " I want to tell you something , " Ira said . " Go ahead . " " I spent all my money . " " What ? " " I had almost eight hundred dollars left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending it . Everything I saw I wanted . I bought suits . God , I do n't know how many . They 're all hanging in my room at the school . I bought books I never intend to read . I could n't stop .
