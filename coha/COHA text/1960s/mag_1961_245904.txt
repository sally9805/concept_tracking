Now that everyone seemed to be taking for granted that the recession has reached its low point . Government economists began nervously eying the quality of the recovery . Aside from a quickening of business confidence , they had a few definite signs to go by-a slight increase in steel orders , department store sales up 5% in Easter week , auto sales for March up 15% . Of the twelve leading indexes , e.g. , raw-material prices , that the National Bureau of Economic Research uses to measure the business cycle , nine have already turned upward . Said Walter Heller , chief of the President 's Council of Eco nomic Advisers : " We assume that the leveling-off is near at hand . But that 's the beginning , not the end of our problem . All along , we have felt that the performance of the economy during the recovery phase will determine whether we can get the economy back to full production . " <P> Cautious Forecast . The chief fear among Government planners is that the recovery will be as moderate as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( gross national product dropped less than i% ) . Now they anticipate , at least for 1961 , even less of an upturn than the one that followed the 1958 recession , when the G.N.P . jumped $50 billion in the year after the recession ended-but still got poor marks for vigor from the economists . In a cautious economic fore cast , Government economists predict that the G.N.P . will rise from its present estimated $500 billion to $502 or $503 billion in the second quarter , may reach $520 billion by year 's end . That would make the year 's average $509 billion . <P> As confidence in the recession 's end spreads , much of the boost will come from businessmen curtailing their inventory liquidation , the biggest factor in the G.N.P . slump . In the next quarter , the rate of inventory liquidation is expected to ease to about $2 billion , providing a solid lift for the economy . But that turnaround would not be as great as in 1958 , when the inventory rate swung from minus $7 billion in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do economists look for any strong spurt in housing starts , which have helped pave the way for all previous postwar recoveries . <P> Serious Problem . Concern over continued unemployment has now replaced achievement of growth as the dominant theme in the Kennedy Administration 's economic thinking . Part of the concern is political : the Administration clearly recognizes that the specter of unemployment is an effective lever for pushing its economic programs through Congress . But it also fears that the business upturn will not make any appreciable dent in the U.S. 's 5,500,000 unemployed , 1,800,000 of whom have been out of work for 15 weeks or more . Last week the Labor Department announced that , while the total of jobless in the month ending in mid-March declined by 200,000 , the decline was less than seasonal . Unemployment now stands at 6.9% of the total work force . Paradoxically , employment rose more than seasonally to a new March record of 65.5 million , up 1,249,000 over a year ago .                @ @ @ @ @
