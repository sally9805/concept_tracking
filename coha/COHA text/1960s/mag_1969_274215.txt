An ambassador of the United States is worth a great deal . <P> With that chilling calculation , spelled out in a note left in U.S. Ambassador C. Burke Elbrick 's Cadillac in Rio , a group of Brazilian terrorists last week launched a fantastic-and successful-caper worthy of Mission : Impossible . Expanding on a terror technique already familiar in Latin America , leftists kidnaped the U.S. diplomat , blackmailed South America 's most powerful government , sprang a randy group of political prisoners from jail and got them to sanctuary in another country-on a Brazilian military plane . The abductors ' note was signed by two bands-the National Liberation Action Group , a Brazilian anti-government underground outfit , and the October 8 Revolutionary Movement , or MR-8 , a Castroite group that takes its name from the date of Che Guevara 's 1967 capture in Bolivia . In return for Elbrick 's life , the terrorists made two imaginative demands , to which the government hastily agreed . First , Brazilian newspapers , radio and TV stations had to run a tiresome , 950-word anti-government " manifesto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 political prisoners and fly them to sanctuary in Mexico . <P> Scrupulously Formal . A witty career diplomat who has served as the U.S. ambassador in Yugoslavia and Portugal , Elbrick had been a hit with Brazilians almost from the moment he arrived on July 8 . While maintaining scrupulously formal relations with the military regime , he mixed enthusiastically among the civilian population . One evening he and his wife danced past midnight at a party with Brazilians from Rio 's ramshackle favelas . After the murder of U.S. Ambassador John Gordon Mein in a kidnap attempt in " Guatemala a year ago , Elbrick 's predecessor , John Tuthill , kept a bodyguard and frequently changed cars and routes for the trip between the downtown Rio embassy and residence in Rio 's Botafogo district . Elbrick scorned security recommendations , and two weeks ago dismissed his Brazilian guard detachment . <P> Elbrick 's kidnapers had been waiting for him at a street corner near his residence for more than five hours , lounging about so carelessly that a neighbor reported them as suspicious to the police-who did nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He never arrived . His Cadillac swung into a narrow street , a red Volkswagen swerved to a halt in front of it , and a blue one pulled up behind . Three gunmen got in the car and drove on to Rio 's 2,300-ft . Corcovado Peak , apparently chloroforming the ambassador along the way . At the mountain , the kidnapers carried the ambassador to a waiting Volkswagen and sped off , leaving his chauffeur behind unharmed.
