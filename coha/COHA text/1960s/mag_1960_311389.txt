Russian space scientists last week scored a new first of sorts . They admitted that something went wrong with one of their spacecraft . <P> When the Russians launched their latest satellite , they described it in some detail : it was a practice spaceship , weighing five tons ( a new orbiting record ) , and containing a cabin with the necessary fittings to keep a man alive . There was no man on board , the Russians said , only a dummy the weight of a man . As the satellite cruised around the earth , instruments would report whether conditions inside it were right for a living man . Then the cabin would be detached and brought down to burn up in the atmosphere . The Russians said they would make no attempt to land or recover the cabin . <P> " Alive . " Since it took to space on perfect propaganda schedule before the Paris summit conference , the Russian satellite provoked nervous curiosity in Washington that it might be more than it seemed . Washington State 's well-informed Democratic Senator Henry M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate Armed Services Committee , made headlines by announcing : " There is growing reason to suspect that a man may be sitting in the Soviet ' spaceship ' , circling the globe at this very minute , and that the Soviets may very shortly attempt to return this man-alive-to earth . " Major General John B. Medaris , the U.S. Army 's former missile chief , suspected the same thing . The Russians are " not so stupid , " he guessed , as to put up a man-carrying satellite with no man in it . Neither Jackson nor Medaris gave evidence to back their hunches , but students at Nasson College in Springvale , Me. listened to the satellite 's radio and claimed to hear a jumbled voice " like Donald Duck with a sore throat . " A dissenting opinion came from Brigadier General Don Flickinger , Air Force chief of bioastronautics . Flickinger taught that the 10,000-lb. spaceship might be capable of carrying a two-man crew , but he did not believe it was actually carrying a living man . The Russians , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not send a man into space without a good chance of getting him back . <P> U.S. tracking stations and amateur moon-watch teams followed the spaceship , which was clearly visible at dawn and dusk . Its three radio transmitters made it easy to track electronically . Four days after the launching , a moon-watch team at Sacramento , Calif , reported that the spaceship had apparently separated into three parts . Soon Air Force and Smithsonian trackers at Cambridge , Mass. concluded that the spacecraft had thrown off small parts , perhaps seven in all , and was on a new and higher orbit whose apogee ( high point ) had risen from 208.6 miles to 418.5 miles above the earth . <P> Something must have gone wrong . The way to bring a satellite , manned or unmanned , down to the atmosphere is to fire a forward-pointing retrorocket to reduce its speed . If this is done properly , the satellite will curve down into the denser air , where it will be slowed further by friction . If the retrorocket is fired in the wrong direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an orbit with a higher apogee . The U.S. Air Force Discoverer satellite program has suffered from just such aiming errors .
