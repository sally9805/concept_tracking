A little over two years ago , Egypt 's Gamal Abdel Nasser convened the Arab world 's first summit conference in Cairo , and managed to build a faade of " Arab Unity " against the common Israeli enemy . In a swirl of fellowship and flowing robes , Arab Kings and Presidents embraced as brothers , organized the Palestine Liberation Organization , set up a joint Arab military command , and created a committee to plan the diversion of Jordan River headwaters flowing into Israel 's Sea of Galilee . The faade has been crumbling almost ever since , and last week with the approach of the fourth such summit , scheduled for Algiers on Sept. 5 , it had all but collapsed . Nasser , joined by his Arab Socialist allies , was demanding an end of summitry " until we can be assured things will go right . " Saudi Arabia 's King Feisal was demanding that the summit go on as scheduled-with or without Nasser . <P> The split over the summit was symbolic of everything wrong with so-called Arab unity . Four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in Yemen , a microcosm of the far larger struggle between the Socialist and conservative forces in the Middle East . By early this year , Feisal was talking up the possibility of an " Islamic " summit meeting next March that would theoretically include all Moslems , but clearly had the aim of rallying anti-Nasser leaders into a single alliance . So far , Feisal has strong support from non-Arab but strongly Moslem Iran , as well as Tunisia ; he also enjoys sympathy from Jordan , Morocco and Kuwait . This month the King plans to visit Turkey 's Premier Suleyman Demirel and , in September , Morocco 's King Hassan II and possibly Tunisia 's President Habib Bourguiba . <P> Second Highest . Nervous at Feisal 's maneuvering , Nasser decided that it was time to grab back the initiative . In an angry broadcast three weeks ago , Egypt 's leader called for an " indefinite postponement " of the Algiers summit , declaring : " We can not sit side by side with reactionary elements . " That seemed to kill any chance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabia would not go along with postponement . " More than ever before , " said Feisal , " there is dire necessity for Arab summit conferences , in order to unify the Arab effort . " Moreover , said Feisal , his country , which is the Middle East 's second highest contributor ( $22.4 million ) to Arab summit organizations , would refuse further payments unless the meeting were held . In the end , only Jordan rallied to Feisal 's side , and the Arab League had no choice but to postpone the meeting . Undaunted , Feisal began pressing even harder for his Islamic summit next spring . " Perhaps , " sighed one Saudi Cabinet member , " Allah will succeed where Arabs have failed . "
