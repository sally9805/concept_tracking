F PARENTS TO THE EDITOR : As the mother of a 17-yearold daughter , I would like to be heard . I am tired of having the accusing finger pointed at parents ( " What Did We Do Wrong ? " Nov. 26 ) . Yes , we , are middle-class parents . My husband is an advertising executive . He cleaned chicken coops when he was 11 years old and worked himself up from a mailroom boy to his present position . We live in a modest development house and with four children ; we do not live in luxury . We do not spend our time on the cocktail circuit or the golf course . Yes , my husband has to work many a weekend and has to travel , which does take him away from his family . This is what his job demands . We had to move twice during my daughter 's high school years , which contributed to her emotional instability . This again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my . child became acute when we moved within 15 minutes of New York City . Though we have very definite standards and rules of conduct for our children my daughter became increasingly rebellious . With public transportation readily and cheaply available , those youngsters could come and go as they pleased . When I felt that I was losing control I went for help and advice to the school and to professional family counseling , but there is no help . The children do not respect any authority . My daughter 's friends successfully defied their parents , the school and the juvenile court . The adult world has capitulated on every point  --  hair styles , the dress code . Everybody is busily jumping on the bandwagon making money , writing songs about the drug habit , movies about LSD . Sensationalism is rampant . Filthy , pornographic literature and perverted obscenities are readily made available to our children under the guise of freedom of expression . Little children are talking about pot like lollipops . The stuff is handed to our children free of charge by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are closing our eyes to what goes on . No , I do not believe in pushing my child out of her home because she was unable to develop a sense of responsibility . I want her to know that I will always love her , // TREND-SETTER ? Dance director Busby Berkeley works out a routine for Warner Brothers ' still-remembered movie musical of 1933 , " 42nd Street . " Letters // whatever she does . We will always help her without indulging her in every whim . We will try again and again to make her see the validity of the values that my husband and I believe in , namely that the joy of living lies in working hard for the things you want and nobody owes you your living . I do not know where the answer lies . I hope that my sincere statement as a mother and not as an expert will draw some valid comment from people more expert which can be of help for us parents who are trying honestly to cope with the problem . SUSAN HARRIS . Liverpool , N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subculture has the kind of power it has today is that the adult culture is as confused and unsure of itself as its offspring and as unable to cope with the uncertainties of modern society . We have no tried and true method of raising and educating our children ; we have no absolute answers to their questions , we are beset with the never-ending problems of war , peace , civil rights and human rights . Finding no clear-cut solutions to these problems , the average American parent , who can not seem to live with ambiguities , will often give in to the mock self-assurance of his children . Mrs. EVELYN GORDON . Bala Cynwyd , Pa . LIVING LEGEND To THE EDITOR : An advertisement in The Chicago Tribune on Saturday , Nov. 11 , indicated that one of the guests that evening on a television program affectionately known as " Kup 's Show " would be " Busby Berkeley ? Hollywood director of the Golden Age of musicals . " I did n't watch the show , but I am sorry that I did n't see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I read the following paragraph in the Magazine the next day ( " The Line at Radio City Music Hall , " by Gerald Jonas , Nov. 12 ) : " . . . and go into a series of kick-combinations that set the tassels on their sequined tights aquiver while the audience in the 6,200-seat Showplace of the Nation holds its breath and the shades of Florenz Ziegfeld and Busby Berkeley beam down approvingly from the Great White Way in the Sky . " If Berkeley is. dead , Kup must have done a remarkable job of resuscitating him for the show . If Berkeley is alive , what is he doing up there with Florenz Ziegfeld ? ALAN E. KURLAND . Chicago . The author replies : " It is a remarkable achievement for a man to become a legend in his own lifetime . Mr. Berkeley 's work on the great Hollywood musicals of the thirties has made his name synonymous with the glamor of that period . My only intention was to pay tribute to the man and his work . The work lives on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having implied otherwise . " OUR UNKNOWN LEADERS To THE EDITOR : Despite my compassion for the sad subject of Warren Weaver 's article ( " Romney Sounds an Uncertain Trumpet , " Nov. 19 ) , I can not help but be grateful for the first-hand report on the Don Quixote from East Lansing who has the temerity to seek the high office of President . But then , is he showing any more gall than most of the other aspirants , past and present ? The other aspirants , with one or two exceptions , show , little more comprehension of the . problems facing them , little more intellectual acumen and insight and just about as much intelligence . The issue that fascinates me is how in this nation of Further reproduction prohibited without permission . 200-million we allow mediocrity to arrogate to itself endless wisdom and to parade itself before us as today 's Moses . I am sure there are thousands of very able men and women scattered around the country in the press corps , in institutions of higher learning , in social service agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and shoulders above the Romneys , Nixons , Johnsons , Humphreys and Percys in insight , mastery of facts , skill in analyzing problems , compassion , rhetoric , honesty and lucidity ? not to mention self-effacement . Yet we allow these others to be foisted on us as our best national leaders . By what skullduggery or sleight of hand is this achieved ? These men , along with the Goldwaters and the Eastlands , hold offices of esteem and grave importance despite clear evidence of their ineptness and lack of substantial qualities and faculties of analysis , cogency and farsightedness . JOHN WHITEHALL . State College , Pa . CREEPS ON THE STREETS To THE EDITOR : Being a homosexual , I naturally agree with the aims of the homophile movements , but realize that such goals will never be reached in my lifedine ( " Homosexuals and Civil Rights , " Nov. 19 ) . The first step , of course , Is to revise the puritanical laws that drive us into prison and the hands of blackmailers , but no series of laws , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapproval of us . It is a shame that most of the public view us as being the slim , made-up , effeminate creep that haunts the streets flaunting his homosexuality for all to view . If we dared be more open and the public saw that the majority of this minority of four million in general looks and acts no differently from them , maybe their disapproval would not be so severe . Until then I will send financial support and applaud the courage of homosexual groups while I cower in the background . NAME WITHHELD . New York . TO THE EDITOR : Webster Schott , while presenting a sociologically informed and sympathetic picture of the plight of the homosexual in our society , also serves to perpetuate an unexplained myth when he states " and once an adult homosexual , probably always a homosexual . " Clinical studies of both male and female homosexuals published within the last five years indicate therapeutic optimism on the order of 30 to 50 per cent for those who present themselves for psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy and remain in it . While these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all homosexuals , they do indicate that many homosexuals , both male and female , can become heterosexually oriented . If they are made sufficiently aware of the positive potentials for a heterosexual adaptation via psychiatric treatment , they may then be motivated to seek such assistance . HARVEY E. KAYE , M.D. , Clinical Associate in Psychiatry , New York Medical College . New York . To THE EDITOR : During the last few years it has become fashionable in socalled " liberal " circles to look upon homosexuals as sick persons rather than as criminals , and to recommend their consignment to hospitals for " cure " of their illness rather than to prisons as punishment for their crimes . I shall let others appraise the humanitarianism inherent in proposals to impose upon homosexuals indeterminate sentences in hospitals rather than fixed terms in prison . The question the homosexual continues to ask is how much longer warped logic will be permitted to masquerade as scientific truth . To characterize homosexuality as an " illness " does violence to every known definition of the term . What kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impairment or malfunction of any kind , either physical or mental , and no disease ? Only by an entirely novel use of the word can homosexuality be described as an illness . Furthermore , any definition of illness which can be made to fit homosexuality will also fit many other conditions , such as , for example , vegetarianism . The homosexual has a sexual preference for members of the same sex ; the vegetarian an alimentary preference for noncarnivorous foods . In neither case is there any impairment of functions or any disease . The homosexual is physically capable ' of heterosexual relations but , because he obtains no satisfaction from them , he does not engage in them . The vegetarian is capable of subsisting on a meat diet but , since the thought is repulsive to him , he does not do so . There is another goal which homosexuals seek , and that is the basic human right to be consulted regarding their own fate . At present only proposals which emanate from unimpeachable heterosexual sources are granted earnest public consideration . Suggestions which appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are rarely discussed on their merits . Is the rightness of a cause any the less right because a homosexual espouses it ? For that matter , is only the white man qualified to promote the cause of Negro emancipation ? Does not elementary justice demand that , when , committees and groups are-formed for the purpose of research and investigation in the field of homosexuality , the homosexual be granted some place on them ? NAME WITHHELD . New York . PROGRAMS FOR THE RETARDED TO THE EDITOR : In her article on mental retardation , " Some Children Are Special , " Nov. 5 , Rita Kramer wrote sensitively of the hope that is growing for the parents of retarded children . But she points out that even in New York , " the richest state in the nation , there can be waiting lists for admission to state institutions . " The Mental Hygiene Facilities Improvement Fund , created by the Legislature at Governor Rockefeller 's request to hurry the mental hygiene construction program , began operations in 1964 . So far this year , fund projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the retarded . Buildings under construction will add another 1,874 beds . Buildings now being designed will add 4,660 more . The state 's construction program for the mentally retarded since the fund 's establishment , including 58 completed projects and 115 now under way , amounted to $139,371,677 on Oct. 31 . Among the projects on which architects ' are now at work are six state schools , to be built in the Bronx , Brooklyn and Manhattan and upstate in Albany , Syracuse and Wilton . In addition , the Department of Mental Hygiene is completing preliminary studies for two more state schools on which architects will begin work in a month or so . They will be in Westchester and Queens . Not all the projects under way for the mentally retarded will add beds to the state 's inventory . A new $1-million intensive-therapy center now being constructed at Willowbrook State School will add training facilities to five residential buildings that had been built without space for activity programs . In addition , about $16-million of the current program is being spent on the improvement ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such renovation must be done where necessary , the overriding problems remain overcrowding ? and waiting lists for admission . Last year , to help ease this situation 10 temporary buildings were erected at Willowbrook at a cost of $1.4-million to provide additional accommodations quickly . At Suffolk State School in the last , two years , new buildings costing $27.2-million have been completed or are now nearing completion . A program that now stands at $139-million may seem large to anyone unfamiliar with the extent of the tragedy of retardation . But this program must be understood against a heritage of neglect . From the nineteen-thirties to the nineteen - sixties no new state school was constructed in New York state . Much still remains to be done . As Mrs. Kramer 's article pointed out so ably , government can be made to stop and listen when the concerned parents of the mentally retarded press their case with conviction and dedication . MILTON MUSICUS , Executive Director , Mental Hygiene Facilities Improvement Fund . Albany , N. Y. ALL THE . WAY WITH H.S.T. To THE EDITOR : Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out an inaccuracy in his article in the Oct. 22 issue , " Johnson Has the Kind of Troubles Truman Had . " Erroneously , he listed me as among " Democratic stalwarts who were hung up on the Eisenhower fixation of almost 20 years ago . " Although I was invited to join the Eisenhower move he referred to , I declined to do so , expressly and categorically , from the start , and advocated instead the election of Harry S. Truman from the start  --  and continuously . I was proud of my decision then , and I am proud of it now . WILSON W. WYATT . Louisville , Ky.
