The way his one-week Austrian state visit was going , Soviet President Nikolai Podgorny ought to paraphrase a classic Kennedy remark by saying : " I am the man who accompanied Natalya Nikolaevna Podgornaya to Vienna . " His daughter Natasha , 21 , a shy Moscow medical student , was winning the Viennese in a way that crusty Podgorny never could , constantly outspacing her father in the daily papers , which delighted in chronicling all her visits to shops and operas . Papa Podgorny looks disconcertingly like Nikita Khrushchev , but Natasha , wearing sometimes dowdy Russian fashions and no makeup , had such a fresh nonpolitical charm for the Austrians that one government official observed : " She 's the best public relations gimmick the Russians have . " <P> After a year as deputy mayor of New York City , sharp-spoken Lawyer Robert Price , 34 , thought it was time to turn his sword into a plowshare , resigned to become executive vice president of the mutual-funding Dreyfus Corp . " The only advice I can give my successor , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk with your back to the wall and keep your Bible handy . " <P> " He 's got to be joking ! " hoo-ha 'd Elizabeth Taylor , 34 . Funny thing , but Singer Eddie Fisher , 38 , was serious . On grounds of " extreme cruelty , " he asked Los Angeles Superior Court to give him a divorce from Liz more than two years after she married Richard Burton . Eddie does n't think Liz ever got a valid divorce , since he was not represented at the 1964 proceedings in Mexico . And to make the joke seem even bigger , he requested the court " to determine the nature and extent of the community property of the plaintiff and the defendant and that the same be divided equally between them . " On that basis , Plaintiff Fisher could collect as community property about $1,000,000 of the money she earned in Cleopatra , her epic romance with Dick . <P> <P> In 1959 , Miss Holland won after tattling to the judges that Miss Italy 's bathing suit was padded . Last year there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingdom won the contest for the second straight time , and this year 's Miss World competition did n't promise to be much more ladylike . When the winner was finally chosen in London 's Lyceum Ballroom , green-eyed Miss Malta shrieked : " The judges must be blind ! " Not at all , though they did show a certain lack of foresight in picking Miss India , Bombay Medical Student Reita Faria , 23 . The new Miss World is n't especially interested in the title . Collecting her $7,000 prize money , she waved away the usual lucrative year of personal-appearance and film offers , prepared to rush home instead to finish her studies , become a gynecologist and marry a Bengal tea planter .
