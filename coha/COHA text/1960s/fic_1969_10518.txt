at the post office . The room and kitchen were top-floor rear , with a fire escape leading to the roof . The roof door could not be locked . Neither could the one on the twin , adjoiningbuilding . Nor the front entrance to either tenement . The downstairs bells did n't work . Odd people came and went , often knocking on my door , on unlikely errands . The door lacked a peephole and a chain . There were sounds throughout the house , at all hours , of scurrying and violence . All this apart , I was not , then , in the best of shape . I doubted the good will , I doubted the neutrality even , of people I passed in the streets . Drinking calmed me , but I moved toward a five-dollara-dayhabit , which was well beyond my income . Yet through it all there must have been serene , productive moments , until they got a fix on my post office shift . I worked Monday through Friday , seven to eleven P.M. It 's cause for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Weeks before I 'd drunk myself to bed on a Saturday night , but woke before midnight to noises on the fire escape . The opulent double bed , with its purple counterpane , was right under the pair of windows . ( It consumed half the tiny room ; I 'd sublet from a pudgy fairy , ad in The Village Voice , who 'd gone to do something theatrical in the Southwest . ) I peered groggily out . I could see only legs . I knocked on the windowpane . He vanished up the fire escape . I fell back into sleep , feeling the weight of it the following morning . I took to sleeping with a hammer and a bread knife under the bed . It seemed to help to have a choice of weapons . When they finally came they smashed the windowpanes . They made off , the first time , with my Olympia portable and a cheap transistor radio ( AM only ) . I 'd bought the typewriter in London ; it had a  --  instead of $ sign . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a , a and o affixed for Britta 's sake . So it was serviceable in at least two languages , and seemed to summarizemy European experience . I was naturally attached to it . That night , around midnight , half blind from sorting mail ,  |p101I  arrived home to find my door thrown open . Empty soda bottleslay and stood in the hall outside . Every light was on . Wind whooshed through the broken pane . Shoeprints stood outlinedon the unmade bed . More even than fear I felt violated , fucked and drained by a malevolent giant . I phoned the police . They came in jig time , calling me Jason from the moment they arrived . I was too humbled to object . I could even see their point . If you lived in a burglarized shithole , if you earned fifty a week , the Law was obliged to tutoyer you . They were a detective and a pair of cops . They made fairly light of my loss . I gave them the Olympia 's serial number , which they jotted down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if I was supposed to tip them to look harder . They milled about , filling the apartment . I was not eager to have them leave , but they did , and again I got through the night . It smashed me the next day , as had the trousers on the fire escape . I saw Covington that afternoon . In his sweet , gray voice he suggested the YMCA . It seemed a good idea . I slept for two nights at the Y on Thirty-fourth Street , not far from where I worked . A sailor a few rooms clown was robbed of his wallet on the very first night . I maintained my cool . I felt fairly well protected by the law of averages . On the third afternoon , refreshed , I returned to my apartment . I shook off apprehension as I neared the top of the stairs . Only the bottom lock was locked ( I almost always locked both ) . I turned the key and walked in . The piece of laundry cardboard I 'd stuck into the shattered pane was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glittered on the bed . Books lay scattered on the floor . They had rightly surmised I kept some money in a book  --  ten dollars at the time  --  but had not discovered it . My clothes were stacked fairly neatly on the bed . The pockets had been turned inside out , but every garment was accounted for . Nothing at all had been taken . There had been nothing to take , clothing apart . I felt a little offended . The Harris tweedp102jackets were n't bad . But I 'd received the message , shaking in the sunlight . I could n't live there any more . I returned Greenwich Village to the junkies , the faggots , the brave girls from Minnesota . I picked up the phone and called my father . He was not working at the time . He asked no questions . He was there , climbing the five flights , in half an hour . I was packed and ready . He grabbed the two heaviest cases . My mother was waiting in the car . I wished he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strange to me outside her own apartment . I was afraid to look into her face  --  of the pity I might find there , or the secret glee . I got in wordlessly and we drove off , myself and the authors of my flesh , back to the house I grew up in , after a brief attempt to make it on the outside . I was thirty years old . I had lived close to five years on the Continent , not a few in the Far East , these credentials would emblazon my dust jacket , but I could n't live alone in New York . Merde ; I 'd as soon not go into it . This ten-minute journey from the West Side to the East Side took place in March of 1963 . After a month of drinking Harry 's booze and licking myself into shape I quit the post office for reasons of health and took the Greyhound to Arizona . While I was there my book came out . ( I had known that it would . ) A foundation gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I came home by jet . Some five days later , when Harry woke me at seven thirty in the morning to autograph a copy of my book for presentationto his twin brother , I got off my laurels and found an apartment . For a while , in the new place , I slept with a length of lead pipe beside the bed . Ground-floor rear with garden seemed at least as open to access as top-floor rear with fire escape . I triple-bolted the wooden door which led from house to porch , and kept checking the lock on the thin metal door which led from porch to garden . On the porch , there were storm windows backing up the screens . The lead pipe was still around in Christa 's time , tucked in a corner of the study . I didp103not know if I could ever use it . But I contained enough freefloatingrage , and violent curiosity , to almost look forward to the sanctioned chance , defending one 's property and privacy being so sacred a charge . So I impressed on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out and the front chain on when she was in alone . But most of the time we came and went together . To my favorite restaurants . For walks . To the movies . Once , even , to the theatre . To visit friends ( mine ) . Explored the A &P; together . Sang love 's refrain together . Played games . " Sarkissian " one post-prandial , planless night " you play chess ? " " Yes , a little . " " NO SHIT ! You 're beautiful ! Let 's play chess . " " I 'm not very good . " " Me neither . " So while the snow fell , the cat twitched in dreams , steam banged through the pipes with an irregular , homey noise , we curled on the blue rug within easy reach of the jug of Zinfandeland played six or eight games over a couple of nights , and though I had not lied to her about the nature of my talent , I was bad in some other , some Class C league , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ) take certain moves back , but it did n't really help ; and though I was good at it , and suggestedit , and would have relished it , she would not let me have the instructional role . So we switched briefly to darts , British style . I taught her the rules , she had a certain flair . But my endless bouts of solitaire on top of my old-world training had left me unbeatable , and that game too went by the boards . " It 's pointless to go on playing with this great difference in skills , " she said ; fuck le sport , she wanted to win , and sadly , yet secretly seconding the view , I agreed to a halt . We had a few visitors . My young editor and his younger wife dropped over one evening . It turned out that the wife and Ip104(life 's endless , impossible fictions ) had grown up in the same apartment house , but with the eight-year age difference I 'd never noticed she was there . Pisacano came by briefly one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his New jersey holdings , failed , but stayed awhile ; but mostly we were alone . She did some sketching , she wrote a number of letters , using the typewriter when it was free , which was most of the time : to her mother in California , her sister in Stockholm , to Denby in Tucson ( I owed him one myself but could n't find the mood ; besides , I 'd be risking duplication in the circumstances ) , to a man in Berkeley , Donald Something , a name she had n't mentioned . ( I offered to mail a pile for her one evening , knowing she knew I 'd check the addressees , and she let me have them . ) And we went on with our dialogue . Or I decided , for a numberof reasons , it was time it became one  --  that I open more , contribute more . The matter of the psychotherapist exercised me most . After twenty-eight months of it , I was barely convinced that I had one . I 'd begun at the clinic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week , then switched to his office seven months later when foundation monies left me too rich for total charity . Frank Covington . He was , I have alreadysaid , a nice man . I never did learn much about his privatelife . He was in his late forties , appearing younger , althoughwholly gray . Weakly handsome , my own height , body nondescript and trim . Head slightly large for his body . He was well-read , loved to quote hopefully apposite lines of poetry . He was nondirective ( short on life advice ) . What you would call eclectic in approach . He thought on his feet  --  uhh , uhh  --  weighing each remark . He was tacting himself to find out how I felt . I had no way of measuring how much he had done for me . I knew I did n't love him , but he confirmed my opinion that I did n't have to . Whatever we had between us , he suggested , was per se a transference . Hopefully beneficial . For $12.50 an hour , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up . He had to suck back yawns in the latter instance . Despite backslidings such as Gillian , and withholding credit for my sudden swollen income , I thought I had made progress , taken inner soundings , since my Charles Street days . I could stroll in the streets now without fear or favor . I drank a wee bit less . I ran my writing course with something like aplomb . Yet could I ever be sure I would not have made such small , shaky strides on my own ? It was best to assume I would not . Else I risked perpetuating my snotnosed , snide ingratitude , life-style , defenses , my problem . Plus have to face whateverrage would be attendant on the thought of so many twelve fifties wasted . Better all around to imagine ( however modest ) inroads . Two and a half years is not long ; Sams is a tough nut to crack . From time to time I toted up the rewards . I knew now , roughly , what I looked like . ( Once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the beard . The face below was not one I knew or cherished , was not my original face ( ( though it remainedthe one I gave myself in dreams ) ) . Letting the beard come back , then , helped not at all . At last , three years later , under Covington 's tutelage , I 'd learned to operate behind that prickly , Pentateuch facade . ) I knew what ( working at one tenth of capacity ) I had managed to accomplish , and that my scheme of writing my way into heaven  --  present , lengtheningparalysis , nightmares of failure , to the contrary  --  were as reasonable as my fears of winding up behind the European edition of the Herald Tribune and fourteen empty cognac glasses with a great , inchoate novel in my head like thirty thousand other egos who expected any moment to begin to Write , Get It Down , so their lives should not seem total zero , had not been reasonable . ( " You 're a poor custodian of your talent , " a nice , bitchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to me ; it rankles still . " You 're the Great Stoneface , " said Mrs. Chambers in the seventh grade when one of her rare witticisms surprised and failed to amuse me ; that hurtp106as well ; I 'd always taken it for granted that behind the mountainousbosom and the steely gaze she specially loved me for my intellect . ) I knew , better than ever before , how I came on . With my tough , compassionate exterior , litworld succes d'estime , I wowed them in the early stages , duck soup to seem what they had always wanted , and I did not like to tarnish the image early or late by admitting freely I was crazy . Or worse yet , weak . Or worst , a me-too hobbyist , a mid-sixties chaser of the fashion . ( Though it had been different early on . For the first half-year with the man I would take pains  --  with women  --  to put it on record : " I 'm not half so sturdy as I seem , I 'm a deeply bugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( ( Or maybe because . ) ) I felt I was transparent , that the bright ones would pick it up at once or soon enough , so better to confess . Then too , if I repeated it enough I might come myself to believe it . Somewhere this changed , probably following the first trip to Arizona . ) For while I knew what small , continual deaths , widening ripples of despair , heartbreaking sameness of trouble , had led me to the couch and kept me there , believing in it or not , I knew as well how skilled I had become or thought I had become over the years in hiding the rot from all but the practised eye , and even from the eye on brief exposure . And perhaps this was all that the Good Life entailed  --  keepingthe rot concealed ; lonely , tight-lipped , constantcaulking of the vessel which contained it . Glue and spit . Will power . Emerson . Vale of tears . Everybody suffers . Life the Great Therapist . Only the weak caterwaul and/or go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there was anything to them , then I was , indeed , open to the existential charges of fraud and cowardice . I needed no outsideassistance , I could level them against myself . Some of my best friends , Denby , Pisacano , no more fucked-up than the world is , had spent no time on the whore 's couch ( the way Frank straightened and dusted , like short-time London ladies ,  |p107before  I was halfway out the door ) ; they suffered and bumbled through . And there were those times , frequent since Christa , when feeling very rare , sometimes without the bottle , if more often with , say laying her gently back upon the blue rug of a wet , dismal afternoon , or less than gently , taking her right through her clothing , pushing aside those black silk drawers , or going down to guide her toward submissive frenzy , tongue and tenderness , or putting in time at the machine , and bugger the result . . . there were those times when I 'd watch all the reservations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains my own during the growing-up years . Then I had cunningly come to regard the blackness I lived in as the price of my calling , a moiling Dostoyevskian shit 's creek was the necessary ambience , and if anyone had suggested ( as no one did ) that I Needed Help , I would have wondered with all ill will if I was not being offered a permanent cure for myself . ( Dino , one London two A.M. , our separate single beds in the room we shared in Wiley Mews : " No , Jason ! You got it wrong ! I do n't have problems ! I am my problem ! I AM my problem ! " ) It was not , quite , the tired idea that the Artist is on the face of it Neurotic ; simply that , if he happened to be , maybe you should n't mess around with the balance . And then , runningall this through , I would remind myself that I had not had a single thing to lose : that by the time I turned myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in England , almost a year before Covington ) , I had already not written in several years ; there was scarcely a trace of an artist to be compromised . Nor was there much of one yet . To call my constipated strainingwith Gino Travels " writing " was to stretch the definition . More doubts . More dangers . With my newly subsidized leisure , I 'd follow them down . Wherever this was at , these larger , current questions , I decided to tell Christa where I disappearedto two afternoons a week . She had a right to know . The old idea kicked back ( my transparency , her insight ) thatp108she already knew . Her eyes were wise . She had shown herself intuitive in many ways . " Sarkissian , I have a confession to make . " " Oh ? " " I 'm married . " " I see . " " No , that 's not true . I am not now and have never been married . But I see a psychiatrist twice a week . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know . Yeah . " " My sister goes to one as well . " " Which sister ? " " Both , in fact . But I was thinking of Marcia . " " She sees a Swedish psychiatrist ? " " Yes . " " Which language do they use ? " " English , I expect . " " Have you had any experience with it ? " " No . " " Oh . Well , that 's where I go to , anyway , Tuesdays and Thursdays , from two to three . And Monday nights I teach at the U , from six to nine . Now you can plot my movements at all times . " " Why are you in it ? " " In therapy ? " " Yes . " " Uh . . . writer 's block . " " Has it helped ? " " You see me typing up a storm . " " Mmmm .

" Which was light years from " Mmmm " ; this one an evaluativenoise , followed by silence , while my glib explanation hung there and , one could see  --  a petulant shrug , a downturnedlip was found wanting . What an entirely sexual mouth she had . I am still hard put to describe it . I let the silencehang . She took her lighter from the table and toyed with it . It was a weighty , primitive machine , a long rope in a cylinderthat was sparked by a wheel and somehow set to smoldering . You put your cigarette to the glowing end of the rope . A Greek fisherman had given it to her . It was totally convenient . No fluid , no flint , only the rope to replace at some dim , distant time . " You know , we really ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a fortune . " " How do you go about it ? " " I do n't know . I 'll ask Paul . He 's got a business head . " All that I 'd meant by this remark  --  my accidental superiorityto the world of commerce , good sense in keeping a hand in ( through friends ) all the same  --  was lost on her , I suspected , yet she had picked up something to agree with ,  |p111glanced  at me , nodded vigorously , looked away ; I could not help wondering then whether ( and how badly ) I 'd erred by bringing her up to the loft that night , whether all I 'd done was to set up another dull , honky-tonk disaster in the frantic attempt to prove ( to whom ? ) that I was cured of the need . . . and did she know what was passing through my mind , was that what her glance had conveyed ? I got up and strolled away from the abyss . I could n't live as if my brain was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I had to grant her the same freedom of thought and action I reserved for myself . My " freedom of action " had taken me to Jane Mason 's party the day after Christa moved in . I 'd been invited weeks before . Her apartment was on the Lower East Side , right around the corner from where I lived from ages nine to twenty-one , and retreated to periodically after . Through some hip gerrymanderingthe whole neighborhood had come to be known in some quarters as the East Village . Forty years later the same tottering tenements housed potheads and PRs and poets , instead of Italians and Jews . Given my heritage , then given my beard and aspirations , I should have felt at home down there , one way or the other . Instead I hung between worlds  --  the insular , bigoted , dollar-mad one I spent my young manhood cagily repudiating , at cost to myself , and the disaffiliated , halfass , artsy-craftsy one it had become . To walk those streets , past ageing Mendy 's vegetable stand , behind some long-tressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a morbid , jangling pilgrimage . Although living less than a mile away , I was safe in my amorphous neighborhood , porch and garden . And there Jane Mason had been safe with me for a while . The first time I visited her place I was appalled : It was a four-floor walk-up , a lousy railroad flat in Junkyland East , top floor rear . I feared she would get herself killed , and it would be my doing for luringher ( without intent ) from however bad a marriage , howeverbarren a Southwest life , on my second trip to Tucson inp1121964 . And so I acted , in her house , not so differently from how my mother had when she huffed up five flights the first and last time to visit me on Charles Street , took a slow look around , said , Why did you do it , Jason ? You know we would have helped you out financially . To think of my son living in a place like this . It 's worse than the places I lived in as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have loved to kick her out . And now I caught myself behaving similarly with Jane . I tried to control it . I contented myself with suggesting that she put locks on all her windows . But her radar is good , nor was I as subtle and secretive as I wanted to believe . Impressionable as a rule , absurdly open to the views of others , she here drew the line , persisted in liking her place , seemed almost strengthened by my lack of approbation . ( Fixed it up quite pleasantly , and in the two years she lived there , was never robbed . ) So I went to her party , six months after she moved in . I knew what she was up to . She meant to call attention to certain changes in her life . ( I give this kind of ritual , periodic bash myself . ) She 'd just gotten a new and better job , at an art gallery . Bob Kane , my friend and co-analysand , would be officially installed as paramour . She wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I dug her enough to let her use me this way . Letting her do so would help square certain injustices I fanciedI 'd committed . Also , what the hell , I liked parties . They helped fill my pocket notebook ( for later transcription of legible entries to the larger one ) . Sparked by drink and close quarters , insights abounded , flying glimpses of the way it is , basic chemistry . For whatever you want to do , there is a writerly excuse . For goofing off . Getting high . Giving pain . For rising in the morning . " Christa , I 'd ask you along , but it is n't really that kind of party . " " I did n't ask to be asked along . " " Right , you did n't . Would you like a drink ? "  | " Perhaps a little wine . " " Me too . Some wine . I 'd better pace myself . " I tipped the jug , poured uneven amounts into two tall glasses , handed the short one over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or whatever it is I was . How boorish to inflict your hang-ups on strangers who pass through your life . But how rude not to offer , or arrogant to assume she could n't refuse . Despite her sometimes awkward , more often charming girlish gestures , as if she were still trying on , trying out , the female role , she was a woman of twenty-six , she knew her limitations or she should have , she had been around . I was mothering her in my head , then feeling bad about it , as later in the evening , with the same result , I would try to father Kane . My mind tumbled on . She received the glass in both hands and carried it to the hassock . I sprawled on the couch . I doubt it was the day 's first drink , or mine . I forget what we did on our first full afternoon , alone or together  --  where , if anywhere , we went , what , if anything , I had accomplished . I rememberbeing weary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I still had an hour to kill . I regarded her regarding me . She sipped her wine . I entertained an odd , unbiddenimage : that I looked like ( but how would Christa know ? ) my mother 's father , Isaac , lying just this way at a Passoverseder ; I had n't been to one in seventeen years , which was the year he died . They were joyous affairs ( which was not how I recalled them on my father 's side ; but that bearded martinet died when I was five ) , crowded , melodic , alive , and there had always been a special bond between us . I was his first grandchild , I 'd been named-after Jacob , his father . I can still get a whiff of him at times , his private brew of Turkish cigarettes and schnapps and sweat . So he passed briefly , as I lay there , through my head and body . And did I give off  --  or were the emanations , to begin with , hers  --  the waves and aura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her clan . She inter/rupted herself at once  --  " This might not interest you . . . " but it did . She knew in all detail her own conjunction with that grisly heritage . Who had escaped the Turks and who had not , in what manner each blood relative expired . Until that moment I had known literally nothing about Turks and massacres . Of rape . Drownings . Slaughter by gun . Two million dead . Diaspora . Lebanon , Iraq , Australia , four hundred thousandhere . All I knew of until Christa ' was Saroyan  --  he had once meant a lot to me , gave me my earliest sense of the craft and the role  --  and the two lightweight sots , writers , already mentioned , I met at an art colony the previous autumn . If I had absorbed anything about Armenian history and troubles from reading Saroyan , it had long since vanished . Christa repairedmuch of that . She framed herself against that backdrop of genocide and carnage . She brought it up to date . Her parentshad married in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York and lived there long enough to produce all three daughters , and for her father to commence his record of failure . An unprofitable upstate farm ( her earliestmemories ) , some real estate disasters in the city . Then they moved to California , where he barely squeezed out a living as an insurance salesman . ( This dismal emphasis was hers . ) She still had a scattering of relatives and family friends in New York , including the ones she had briefly stayed with . Then , I believe , she went into her early years in California . I ca n't be certain . I had drifted off . The wine , or her careful , overarticulatedtone , or both , had lulled me . I felt it coming and I mumbled , warned , " I 'm going to nap awhile . " She was still seated on the hassock when I woke . She had replenished her wine . She was reading .

She read on for a line or two before looking up . She shrugged . " Fifteen or twenty min-utes . " " Jesus . I have n't dropped off like that since I was a baby . " " Mmmm . " " I feel marvelous . An odd time to fall asleep , though , in the middle of your story . Let 's say it means I trust you . " " All right . " She flashed a moderately dimpled smile . She showed no distressat my gaffe .

But this was hypothetical . It was more than unlikely I would ever give one . No one nearer than a third cousin or great aunt had died in that war , nor had I come to know any of the kin who had escaped to this country . In any larger way , short of the largest , I felt no involving urge , no outraged identity .

Anyway , I 'd slept ; woke , brushed my teeth , put on a coat , requested , after a moment 's thought , that she do me the favor of answering the phone , and went off to the party .

He would have loved to roll a joint and suck it in congenial company , himself and Jane , but was prudent and parsimonious in a crowd . Yet he seemed content enough without it  --  teased me about this and that with barbed , disconcerting irony . He was living in the world . She 'd done that much for him in their few months together , and would do more in the time ahead .

It seems a precious lode . It interests me , at any rate . I was sired by one , which did not simplify my life . Bob Kane 's being born one did little to ease his . In our college days he came to the house several times and Harry took a liking to him . He offered him cigars , and clapped him on the shoulder . Once , I remember , both of them were there , Bob and his twin brother Dick , and Harry , might I say , was nearly beside himself . ( Today , whenever I see my father , he runs through my friends of that era in a time-stopping litany , do I still see this one , what do I hear from that one , with special affection for the Kanes . ) There was a time , as recently as five years ago , when it was no simple matter to tell Bob and Dick Kane apart . They were the only children of a toy executive , who mostly traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised together , played high school football together , dated together , held virtually all other interests and possessions in common . But they attended different colleges , trying to attain separ-ate lives . I met Bob Kane in 1951 , in our sophomore year . We were both nineteen . I envied the breadth of his talents : he wrote poetry , acted , painted , projected a play about Nijinsky , read widely in Eastern philosophy and religion a decade before they would become coffee-house chatter masquerading asp118the zeitgeist . Dick , who I got to know later , plodded toward a B.A. in sociology a few hundred miles up the coast . They seemed to have found their different places . But they were drafted together on graduation , in 1953 , and stationed together for two years , in Fort Benning , Georgia . When that ended , Bob went to Mexico City to paint and Dick went to graduate school , throwing over sociology for a master 's degree in Fine Arts . And in the years that followed , he built a life .

By this time as well he had learned to live with a fiveyearbackache and a headache of slightly shorter duration , infirmitieswhich dated from the time he began to believe that his wife was sleeping around , and which thereafter , since they really laid him out , sort of obliged her to do so .

His father died at dawn , alone , in a suite of rooms in the Tokyo Imperial Hotel , a set of toy trains running on the floor the while  --  or this is the official version .

I passed the torch . I 'd been trying to drop her ever since she arrived in New York the previoussummer , so she simplified matters by dumping me . This makes the best of it , of course ; rejection is always a drag , whateverone 's own plans . ( Of Jane I still think fondly , my " rubicundlibrarian , " as I called her , bespectacled blondeness , toolargebelly , quaint-hip poetry she wrote , conical African tits . ) In the kitchen , his whey , oval face smiling down , Bob Kane teased me hard .

Bob being similarlyafflicted , perhaps a little worse , what made me come on that way ? I 'd known the man for fifteen years , and never , it was abruptly clear , had I been easy in his company . I 'd never found the proper mask , never felt , with Bob , the way I thought I wanted to feel . I 'm certain it was mutual . Yet we were friends . " Well , buddy , " he says , " digging the party ?

She had a classmate named Daisy living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had hoped , pretty nearly expected  --  for when things are going well , life can seem a series of such ripe contingencies  --  that she would make the trip in the middle of February , when Leslie Dale would be in town for a few between-semester clays.  |p123I  wanted to see Leslie Dale . I acknowledged her claim . Though she knew we were star-crossed , affected amazement at her luck , tried to stay cool in her letters , she let slip nonethelessthat I was one of her two favorite adults , the other being her besotted Medusa of a widowed writer mother . At seventeenLeslie was unformed , a little on the chubby side , an indifferentlay , but I did not shrink from my responsibilities . I 'd once more take her to my bosom , indulge my guru and Pygmaliondrives . This involved putting her up a night or two , guilding her sensibilities , and fucking her a couple of times . With Christa in residence , it was not going to be easy . " Would you rather I went some other time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read minds ? " No , dear , go when you please . Come when you please . You 're a free agent . " She left a couple of days later , on a Sunday , informing her friends with a collect call the night before . We lay around till noon , then she threw some things in the plaid case I 'd borrowedfrom Sarah Shwartz . I 'd phoned Sarah at work and asked for it on Friday afternoon . I had the keys to her oneroomapartment as she had a set to mine . I had not seen her since Christa moved in , though I could hear her pottering at the sink , singing along with her Streisand , through the kitchen vent . She hardly ever went out , except to her job . When I had anything going for me ( let alone a boarder ) , I 'd lock her out of my life . When I 'd landed in the shit , or felt bored or lonely , I'd.drop in , or ask her in , spill my guts m depth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend some time between those porky thighs . The exchange of keys was useful . When I was out of town , or late of an evening getting back , she 'd feed and love the cat . If she wanted a piece of meat defrostedduring the day for her solitudinous evening meal , she 'd phone from her office and I 'd go next door and yank it out , though not always with good grace . She was twenty-sixp124years old . She was Jewish , Brooklyn-born , and hung up on her mother , obvious manifestations of any of which incensed me . Her grocer father was long gone ( I hardly knew a girl at that time whose father still lived ) . She could hear my women come and go , and sometimes , she said , through that same vent , could hear them performing . I suppose she alternately liked me , raged alone , or wrote me off as a nut . Paul , noisily contemptuous , labeled her my " sexual insurance . " There was little enough drama to our first drunken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed to have been a virgin . I suppose it was technically so . It was helpful to believe it . Every man should do everything once , even late in life . Deflower a virgin . Raise a cat . ( Suck a cock ? Kill a man ? ) Cultivate a garden . I wished , however , in category one , that I had done better than Sarah Shwartz . One thing she did which was nice was describe her first orgasm , if such it was , as " blue . " Christa showed no curiosity about her benefactress , though she seemed pleased enough with the bag . We went for brunch to Arthur 's Corner , a newly opened restaurant on Twentieth and Second Avenue . It was little more in its appointments than a fancy luncheonette , but it had a broad , exotic menu . They were featuring a squab luncheon for $2.35 . I felt suddenly festive . I thought of my tiny apartment , which had proved in a pinch it could live two , if not in commodious fashion  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have myself returned to me for the space she was gone . Not that her presence had much impinged on my movement ; but I 'd brought to bear a certain nervy solicitousness , a gratuitous hotelier 's concern , and it would be good , whatever its source , to be able to shed it for a while . I would have myself returned to me ; which did not precludea sense of loss impending , a nudge of regret . Trying , as always , to have it both ways . Endangering either . As wep125studied the menu in the window , I squeezed her waist , then turned and kissed her ear , the dainty fraction showing through her hair . " Listen , let 's have some squab . " " I 'm not that hungry . . . it 's expensive , is n't it ? " " Expensive ? " " It says two dollars and thirty-five cents . " " Christa , you have no real conception of my income . All right , you dine on Ry Krisp . I 'm for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in a booth to the rear of the restaurant . While we waited I phoned Penn Station to check on trains to Baltimore . She had n't bothered . She assumed they ran often enough . There was a convenient train at two , an hour and a half away . The meal was marvelous . Everything was tasty  --  spinach , stuffing , wild rice , salad , rolls , right down to the ornamental crab apple . We stuffed ourselves in silence . Finally I broke it . " You know , you 're the world 's luckiest lady . " " Why do you say that ? " " Friends to visit down the Eastern Seaboard , a hearth to return to . . . " She did some impatient , shrugging thing , accompanied by a hot dark glance which did not ( since I could not tell what it aimed at ) disturb my equanimity , though I was fairly certain it was so intended . My remark was innocent , affectionate , daubed at worst with a diffusive irony , but this is how some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silence closed down again , bringing home , if nothing else , that we were strangers . Finally , over coffee , she said , " Am I making you un-comfortable ? " " Is that your intention ? " " No . " " Why should I be uncomfortable ? " " We 're . . . not saying much . "  | " We were gorging ourselves . " " Mmmhmm . " " You 'd better let me have your address in Baltimore . " " I have no pen . " I handed her my pen . She scrawled Daisy 's name , address and phone number on a paper napkin in the back-slant , loopy hand I 'd learned to recognize . " You may be the only Californian left-handed female painter in the neighborhood , you know ? " " I suppose it 's possible . " " Is anyone else in your family left-handed ? " " Marcia is . My father was . " " They say it screws you up a bit . " " Do they ? " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocketed the napkin . " Thank you . " " Why did you want it ? " " For emergencies , I guess . Maybe your old lady will call . Maybe just so I 'll know where you are . " " Oh . " She 'd phoned her mother once , collect , while I was there , and given her my phone number and address , but she continued to receive her mail at American Express . On some of her out-mail , however , she had written my address as a return , so it was a matter of time before they would be arriving Sarkissian c/o Sams . As innkeeper , this would present me with a minor problem . A number of locksmiths on earlier occasions had pronounced my mailbox key unduplicatable , and so I had no spare . I would always be au courant with what she got . I decidedwe could learn to live with that . We caught a northboundcab on Third Avenue . Penn Station was a ravaged cathedral , in the midst of being destroyed or rebuilt or replaced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , broken vaults , garbling loudspeakers , wandering crowds ,  |p127called  up all the mysterious , oddly homogeneous European terminals in which so many of my dramas had been played , what a tear-jerking wealth , over five years , of arrivals and departures : St. Pancras , Gare d'Austerlitz , Victoria , Estacion de Francia , Malmo , Esha , Britta , Jason , Dino , en route , hello , again goodbye . . . and it occurred to me that Christa , so newly back , so mobile in her time abroad , must have had her share of them too . We located the ticket booth after some trouble , she brought her round-trip ticket , and we still had time to wander . We paused before the mock-up of the mammothindoor **25;10847;TOOLONG they were erecting on the site . After careful study we could find no provision for entrances or exits , and shared a laugh at some poor architect 's expense . Then without warning I was delivering a lecture on priorities , the morality of building multimillion-dollar sports arenas while half the city lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden we had , in which I 'd spent so many rousing adolescent hours ? what was the trouble with the Penn Station they were ripping down , with its inspiring Greek facade ?  --  and from here it seemed a short journey to the illness of our Times , by way of the White House and the shrewd , sick , gross , ignorant man it had seemed at the time we had no option but to put there , who conferred with his bloody lieutenants and talked to us of peace , then spread unspeakable destruction . . . I thought I was railing , to an audience of none , and broke off to peck her dark , Armenian cheek in the everlasting present . Dark . . . the girl had a way of being pale and dark-complected at the same time . She said , " We had just come to Barcelona when I heard that Kennedy had been killed . It was in the lobby of a hotel we were trying to get into but it was full up , some feria or other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaotic . . . my Spanish was n't very good , the whole episode was unreal . It was a day or two before I could believe it . " Well . It was a day or two before we could believe itp128in the King 's own , in our own wild , familiar land . I wondered who her " we " was , almost a reflex , without real curiosity . Then some terrible Martian message came crackling over the P.A. , which seemed to relate to her train . The departure board was not functioning . We strolled toward gate 5 . The queue began to move just as we got there . It was fairly long , moving slowly , and I decided not to wait , not strain at small talk . The welling sadness I chalked up to habit , the nature of stations ; there was no other way at that point I cared to explain it . I 'd known her less than two weeks , barely time to grow attached ; besides which she was returning in two or three days ' time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah 's bag , which I 'd been carrying . " No maudlin farewells , puss . Enjoy yourself . I 'll see you later . " " Yes . " I took her hand , carried it to arm 's length , dropped it slowly and departed . Seconds later I glanced back , but she was alreadypart of the moving throng . And I was lonely . I walked south along Seventh Avenue and east down empty side streets , through the grim Sunday pall which lay on that part of the city . It was cloudy and cold . At Twenty-third and Fifth I went into a pay booth and rang Paul , but he was n't home , or was n't answering . I assumed it was the latter . He was a genius at letting the phone rattle on when he was occupied . Scoring points with whomever he was with , avoiding complications . On my part , I could not resist the lure of that machine , its open-ended promise , and I 've picked it up at times , in positions , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else I might want to spend time with , but no one came to mind . I walked by Paul 's loft . The windows were shuttered , no light came through . So he was away after all , probably in Jersey , scrabbling after that first million . He 'd been on the verge of seven figures ever since I'dp129known him . According to Dino it was nine parts bullshit , and I could never follow the fiscal maneuverings when Paul attempted to describe them ( though I was flattered that he tried , and he let me find some virtue in my ignorance ) , but for all I knew , or cared , his fortune was assured . Whereas Dino was less charitable . But they were always backbiting each other . It was one more variety of friendship . I was suddenly glad of the solitude . I remembered the bottle of Johnnie Walker Black . She 'd bought it tax-free at Luxembourg Airport , but not sprung it on me until the night before : " I 'll leave this for the house , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and guaranteed to leave a dram for her return . I 'd go back and court that waiting fifth  --  introduce myself , leave my card , move in at a sensible hour . In Sweden , with Britta , almost always in the bag by the time she returned from office work at five , I 'd patiently explain that no , little friend , I had n't been drinking alone , I never drank alone , I was partying with the troupe in my head , the soon-to-be-born , my characters . She was too kind or dim to say that downing aquavit with them from nine to five was no way to bring them to the light . But by then , 1961 , we were close to the end of our time . I walked more rapidly . Thoughts of the phone , as well as the scotch , moved me now . It might bring adventure on my head , maybe even riches , if I were only there to pick it up . And I thought also of my Underwood-Olivetti , which I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in earnest . I 'd seen a cartoon a few ( lays before in which a man lolls besotted on a couch , tie askew , idiotic smile , bottle dangling from his hand , while at the typewriter close by the winged muse pounds fiercely . It had wrung forth a laugh . It was as funny as a blow to the kidneys . The cat was seated by the door when I sprang open the secondlock . He greeted me in his fashion , which was to turn his back the moment my face appeared . I do n't know who hep130was ever expecting , but it did n't seem to be me . He wanted out ; I unbolted the doors and let him into the garden . Soon he was high into the overgrown , tree-high privet planted in a neighboring yard but with its limbs extending into mine , leaping and picking his way through the winter branches . They buzzed him near the top , one of the four pair of bluejays who lived there all year round , making squawking passes inches from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more so where my pussy was concerned . It took , I thought , more of his energy and concentration to keep his footing in the branches than other passing felines seemed to expend . But he was a late starter . He 'd caught no bird of any description in our fifteen months together , which was all right with me . And even now , to malign him no further , he kept his head , concentrated on footwork , ignored their scoldingswipes . He was playing in their ball park , there was some bravery in that . He leapt the final yard onto the fence , meowed , and strutted along the fence toward the house , cocky as if returning from some triumph . I was home . Alone . It felt fine . I sniffed for her presence . No heavy scent fogged the rooms . Whatever I thought I had detectedin her Hamburg remarks , she did not confuse the idea of femininity with the idea of the whorehouse . Her worldly goods were for the most part tucked away , in her suitcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few pens and brushes , jars of paint and ink , sat neatly on the drop-leaf table . She would sit on the hassock when she drew , hunched over that table . It did not look very comfortable , but I had no better arrangement to suggest . I was most often in the back room when she worked ( or my going there would trigger her attempts ) , but popped out from time to time to check on the silence . She appeared uneasy only if I peered over her shoulder , so I soon stopped doing that . Otherwise , not looking up , she drew and penciled on . I looked into the closet . She had n't had much clothing top131begin with , and had taken some of it to Baltimore . A gray wool dress , a pair of skirts , the white blouse , were bunched neatly on the left . Natural enough when she was there , they seemed alien to me now . Her suitcase was pushed under the old , decrepitsofa ; with her help I 'd carted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the back room . A portfolio of drawings leaned against the wall in the closet , beneath her clothes . I handled it , without moving it , leafing through . I was looking for the green sketchbook she 'd already shown me , but it was n't there . Perhaps it was in her suitcase , or in one of her drawers , or she had taken it with her . The drawings , I noticed , were signed " Sarkissian , " and they were dated , as far back as 1962 ; I was pleased to see she had a practical side , had taken samples of her work abroad . With mingled fear and virtue I left the folio as I 'd found it . But when I stood , my eye landed on the dresser , and amid the jumble of things , the chessboard , chess pieces , isometric bar , matches , magazines , what cosmeticsshe used , I saw the manilla folder crammed with her mail . I 'd noticed it before , but could easily ignore it while she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really been in doubt , that I would do no work that afternoon . I rolled in a piece of paper all the same , stared a bit , then dated the page . I spun round in the swivel chair ( on long-term loan from Pisacano ) and went to the kitchen for the Johnnie Walker Black . I poured a healthy shot , threw in a couple of cubes , returned to the desk and lit a cigarette . The date seemed to commit me to my journal , which I 'd been neglectingof late , at least since Christa arrived  --  it contained , for example , not one entry relating to her presence . On the other hand , my novel was not writing itself , to my occasional surprise ; it would be wiser to plunge into Gino Travels , the part I 'd been circling for weeks , the Paris/dirty postcards scene . Debating , I sipped at the scotch . Bells sounded in my head , intimations of chemical changes . I remembered that thep132brand was as special as the circumstances in which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to note the difference . I sipped again . It tasted thin , ordinary . Perhapsmy palate was at fault , perhaps they faked you out in Luxembourg ( just as " Colgate " toothpaste has a different taste from land to land ) ; you only bought the label when you bought at tax-free ports . Why could n't I relax , joyously pretend , at least , that I was living well ? The telephone rang , blastingthrough the house . I 'd turned both phones to " loud " when I came in . It rang a second time , a third ; I was letting it ripen , trying to shape the adventure . Only Gillian came to mind , halting , British-voiced , abject , pleading to be allowed to drop around , to be shriven , forgiven , and in her white stockings , which I loved , ceremoniously fucked in the ass . In all likelihoodI would permit it . I had the time to smile widely in the wall-length mirror , condoning my transparency , playpen vindictiveness . I picked it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flush of disappointment ; though he was , I thought wryly , Gillian-connected . It did not seem portentous or risky that my hero , so to speak , should phone in the midst of my struggle to get him down . Any time he called , these days , I could say that the battle was in progress . And I 'd lived through this kind of hopeless magic long before . After he left our London room that morning , retreating penniless with no prospects back to the U.S. , and after I 'd spent the next few days in bed in the dark recovering from him and from the first attack of what would become a chronic iritis , I woke one morning to my ending , Gino had traveled , finis , and wrote my heart out for the next couple of months until I got a letter from a new address , not the Bronx , and damn if that jocularcandidate for bedlam had not gone and gotten married , to a girl he 'd met two weeks before . The letter went on to describetheir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how she was Jewish , beautiful and ap133buyer . Again I took to my bed , this time with Beckett 's trilogy , which is nonparagraphed , so there was no real way to stop , and when I rose again , depleted , and sneaked back to the novel , there seemed no choice but to start it over . Similar dislocations , open-ended vistas , had plagued me in the years since . This was the main trouble with working from life  --  your people did n't lie down . But by now , I fancied , I 'd hacked my way out of that jungle . Until this call , I had n't heard from or tried to reach Gardellain quite a while . This was the way it had been ever since I got back from Europe in the summer of ' 62 and met him accidentallyon Sixth Avenue ( we had stopped corresponding months before ) and he took me up to meet his spouse : a couple of contacts close in time , then a long spell with none . These had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had married a girl of whom Pisacano might say , perhaps he did , that she was sent up by central casting , an arid foul-mouthed garment-center bitch with intellectual pretensions , perennial taker of New School philosophy courses and poetry workshops and noisy second-guesser of where the prof went wrong , the perfect girl to marry if you wanted your balls sewn into your head , or to merely spend the better part of every day in bickering and anguish . She would burst into his room at the end of her working day to see how many pages he had written . ( He was substitute-teaching at the time . ) Dino professed himself flattered by some of this , accepting of the rest , for a year and a half . Then he had almost broken a blood vessel in his neck trying not to kill her . Now , under Covington'stender tutelage , he had just started dating again , and this was how he 'd come to phone . ( And apropos of Frank , I affectedto be amused that the gray man slipped on several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once called Dino Jason . . . but I was closer to enraged . And uneasywith that reaction , too . A terrible ambivalence ! But howp134could I really complain ? Was n't Covington 's precisely the sort of confusion my book was trying to be about ? ) He had dropped off a girl somewhere in my neighborhood  --  it was wholly in keeping with my idea of Dino that his dates should end on a late Sunday afternoon  --  and thought he would stop by . I suspected I was second choice , that he had rung up Pisacano first , but I had still better reasons to refuse . I would love to see him , I said , even on such short notice , but I was well into something and could n't break off now . He was very understanding . He 'd go home , he thought , and do some work himself . I said I 'd call him later in the week . I hung up , glad of my will power , dismayed by my fraudulence . I wondered what Sarkissian was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . She 'd taken the book along . Now , why should I be disadvantaged in the world , more naked than my friends , because I 'd thrust a volume into the public domain ? People had already analyzed it to death , and me as well , and they were n't always wrong . Her art work was fair game by this reckoning , although I knew it was the letters I was after . ( As for that treasure chest , why  --  usually so circumspect  --  had she left the goddamned thing around ? ) I looked to see that the door was locked , the chain in place . I went to the closet . Gingerly I carried the portfolio back to the desk , pushed the typewriter out of the way , and began leafing through . Europe was largely a bust , as she had said : a couple of harborviews , some fishermen emptying their nets , and that was all . Whatever else she 'd done during the past eighteen months must have been contained in the green book , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The earlier work was not remarkable . A pen-and-ink standing nude , ' 63 ( which I have good reason to remember ) , with a pronounced art-class flavor , a young bearded man seated on a patio staring sensitively off toward mountains . Others which I moved quickly through ,  |p135hurrying  to what she 'd done while she was here . There were perhaps a dozen dated Jan/Feb 1965 . At least , I thought , one of us was working , and experienced a rush of midwifely joys . And I liked them , too , after studying awhile . They were in crayon , chiefly oranges and blacks , thick , chaotic swirls and swatches from which figures seemed almost to emerge , hints of limbs and torsos and featureless faces struggling toward birth , toward Bethlehem ; my response was more verbal than visceral , but it seemed to fit her style . I hoped she made the scene one day , a la the young Mrs. Kane , so I could do a piece about her for the Art News . Broadening my own career horizons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a fine time . I turned reluctantly to the last drawing in the folder . It was different from the rest . It was in pencil . It was of me . . . of her . . . it was of Christa being fucked , is the way to describe it . The beard was trimmer than in life , eyes a little wilder , hairy buttocksleaner , but indubitably myself , astride an ample female whose hair fanned over an invisible pillow , her arms and legs protruding from beneath my covering weight , the face turned on camera but features merely suggested by brief wavy lines , which yet could not conceal that it was Christa , and that the drawing belonged to her . I fell into it just that way . I knew exactly how it looked , felt , smelled , to be fucked by Jason Sams . That leering satyr had her pinned , chest to bosom , leg over leg , ass raised slightly for the downthrust , pounding it home , in all his naked shame and glory . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is a way of looking at the act of love . I got up and walked around . I splashed some water on my face . It did n't help . I had perceived what I had perceived : that I existed for her in ways I did not exist for myself . Madre . A little dull home truth , quirkily presented , can shock you near to madness . That others do not see us as we see ourselves . I was living now with a much more formidable woman thanp136the one I had seen off a few hours before . A wise man would have learned from this , cut his losses , stayed out of her mail . In my case , there was not the slightest chance I would not be into it now . She lived in my house , she impinged on my fortunes . I was virtually obliged to probe past the teasing glimpses she 'd allowed me in her unsolicited and highly edited accounts , which created curiosity much more than they assuaged it . In particular I 'd get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into her head regarding me , whether ( or how ) his epistolary manner to the pair of us differed , and maybe also learn how a man of such exquisite taste and timing as to withdraw his penis when the lady teetered on the verge could yet manage to hold her esteem , as he so clearly did . But I knew I would not stop ( nor even begin ) with Denby , once into the pile . I became wonderfully cautious . It seemed imperative that each letter be replaced exactly as and where I found it , more to prove my competence , no doubt , than for practical reasons . For who has memorized the exact shape and order of his mail ? Perhaps someone has . A broad fidelity , at least , a samesideupness , ought to be maintained . I opened the portfolio . It containedan impressive quantity of letters . Rubber bands kept some in small , tight piles , but a great many were loose . Not all were in envelopes . Some faced one way , some another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vitamin B-complex pills , and wished that I had drunk a little less . I was going to have trouble remembering what went where , and if I kept drinking , I knew , I would stop caring . I took the top letter ( disturbingnothing ) from the pile . It was airmailed from London . I give it here in its entirety . Jan 16Darling CGot your wild , wild letter today . By God you are a menace ! Even through the letter I felt the vibrations . I got hard just read/ing . I wonder that the hotel did n't catch fire . It 's only thanks to the general blindness of men that a line was n't formed at your door . Are you lucky they are blind or not ? I look forward to your " virginal vulva " with unconcealed lust and excitement . But if you are so " brimming " as you call it , can you save it ? If no exceptionalpeople : masturbate ! I 've decided that 's much less destructive . Whatever , please be careful of infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ravenously , it would be hell to have you sick . Yes , I 'll buy Doridene . I asked on the way home and they have " Doridine " is it the same ? Sedative ? I 'll try it and see if it 's good . Write me here . I have reservations for Feb io , but can go 13th or 17th . Best I suppose is you see Daisy in Baltimore and I can come there and make you in Daisy 's warm house . Or if some hitch , tell me where and of course I 'll agree . You must make good your promises . An aggressive Christa to carry out lustful designs on me . That provides me with material enough to keep me warm for a lot of lonely nights . And more later . Keep warm . All of it . T.All of it . Straight off the mark , I had this neatly and completelyfucked myself  --  bulled my way into her wild and woolly past and found it waiting in her future . There was a sense of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done me no harm . T was her Tim , of course , purloiner of her cherry , holder of her hand when she gave up some other man 's fetus in Tangier . Such acts , in tandem , add up to love . One could not compete with love . It had not occurred to me until then that I 'd wanted to . Our entire brief association , as deeply as I 'd bothered to explore it , had been based on her being in transit , elsewherecommitted in mind and body , as unlikely to make any claims as to want to be claimed . That , at least , was the way it had started . Proximity had wreaked some changes , ending in the desolate way I had felt at the station . Or I upgraded thatp138feeling now , deciding at the same time that I had n't a hope in hell of holding her as more than a lark on the face of this glimpse into her mail . Nor would any sane man want to . What kind of letter was it to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was this one so clearly in response to , lifting and quotingback its spiciest phrases ? I had known she was interested in sex , but this was ridiculous . The safest approach was to regard her as a colleague , partner in intrigue , worthy of my own machinations and concerns . In fact , my current problem , how to work in Leslie Dale , paled beside her own . The letter was dated two days before we met , she had gone right out ( before she could have received it ) and met an exceptional person , there was absolutely no need , my brother , to destructively or otherwise masturbate ; of what substance was he made , this priapic , saintly male ? She had just gone to Baltimore . To Daisy 's warm house . She 'd worked it out , the clever bitch . I poured myself a drink . I toasted her success . I sought new pregnant meanings in our over-the-squab exchange . Then I realized the dates were wrong : that ( unless he 'd changed his plans , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be arriving for another week at least . So she had gone , in fact , to visit with her girl friend , spouse and child . The crisis , if there was to be one , lay ahead . My heart began to race , striving to bring it near . I jerked myself back to the job at hand . I barely cared now what went where . I rippled through , ignoring a rubber-banded packet from her mother , letters which spanned the eighteen months , addressed to Mykonos , Stockholm , Paris , Rome , Madrid . I fished out a long , lone one from her sister . It was on airmail paper , toilet-thin , two pages of single-spaced typescript , both sides of the page . It was difficult to read unless you kept it from the light . Specialized voyeur that I 'd become , I struggled through . It was an unparseable mixture of her own anguish with advice to her younger sister on how to live herp139life . The distinction between herself and Christa did not seem so clear in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed solicited , a shrill response to specific dilemmas and complaints . I remembered Marcia 's story , as Christa had outlinedit early on : how she 'd met her husband-to-be in Berkeley , had an affair , dropped him , met him years later in Paris entirely by accident , followed him North , and married him in Sweden . By this letter she had left him , or his hearth , was livingalone in Stockholm , seeing a psychiatrist once a week , about to look for a job , and trying to think things through , large and small  --  the meaning of marriage , the meaning of her own , her place in the cosmos , why Mans , her husband , was so adamant about refusing to join her in treatment ( which refusalhad triggered her departure ) ; an intricate stew of brainy insight and emotional confusion and that too-easy identification with Christa which spelled Danger . ( " It 's what always happenswhen they try to think , hubby , " says Dr. Pisacano . ) My heart went out to that Swedish physicist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had taken to wife so deadly a sample , so egregiously female a screwed-up American miss , whose quest for authentic feminine selfhood in a world of crumbling valuesplus suchlike horseshit  --  I can not quote exactly here  --  had robbed him of peace , led to pain and disorder in his world . Or would have in mine . He might have been cut from tougher cloth . I applauded his decision , whatever the reasons , to not come skulking into therapy behind her . And I had some indignation left to spare on Christa 's behalf ( though I could n't really quarrel with some of the judgments : " Why must you still cling to Tim ? Why ca n't you let him go ? " ) , in the consanguine clutches of this smart , strident bitch , this willful , baleful influence . I 'd had enough of Marcia for the t ime . I refolded the letter , returned it to the envelope , the envelopeto the portfolio . I was ready for Denby now . There were seven or eight in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to keep Keiko in the dark . They went back as far as July . I did n't plan to read them all . I was most interested in what he 'd told her about me , and I took out the most recent , sent to Mykonos , dated mid-December . It began , " Dear Baba . " I skimmed through , and found what I wanted . " You might want to look up Jason Sams , if you pass through New York . . . a good person , writer ( beware the beard ) , secretlyin love with my wife , thinks I do n't know , just fell in or is about to a great pile of publishing money and claims to be thinking of turning in his psychiatrist for an accountant or a lawyer . . . " ( I claimed , of course , no such thing . But clearly the lady had already known , if she paid attention to her mail , that I was seeing the Man , long before I 'd agonized . ) I was suddenly put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , which had been too difficult , too remote , to puzzle over at the time . I dug it out , that Februaryevening , and do so now . . . . My cousin sent a letter which arrived yesterday . She is one fucking shrewd bitch ; acknowledging the well-put invitation to look you up in NY , she fires back with a cutting , Go have yourself , DD , you ca n't tuck your conscience ( or something ) away with my skirts , even with the best of intentions . The exact words were : " . . . as much as you 'd like to settle that little question be it there or back when it was n't so much which way I 'd fall as on whom . The point being I do n't fall on but up . You protesting too much notwithstanding . It 's not satisfaction you 'd rock back into but relief . " So , I say , if she does happen to ring your bell we may both consider ourselves blessed . I have begun a novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They all began that way , as had the letter which prefaced his " story . " But the world goes barreling on : " Baba " was living in my house ( all thanks to Dave ) , complicatingmy life to no small degree , and I was deep into their mail.  |p141Like  the rest  --  if without the lover 's poverty of invention , the sister 's convolutions  --  Denby would respond more than innovate , counterpunch , pick up her leads . She 'd taken some drug or other in her travels , methedrine , god knows what  --  Dave was not completely clear  --  and had tried to describe its effects . Obliquely , one gathered . He praised her courage , confessed his curiosity and envy , and begged her to take detailed notes the next time , for his sake , her sake , the world 's : " Teach us , Baba , tell me what you felt , tell me how it was . . . " There were , as well , dollops of personal detail , comments on his scholarly pursuits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his job , his ambivalence toward fatherhood , or the vistas it presented , a trip he was thinking of making ( had made by now ) to the coast , alone , to see about possible publication of a book of his photographs ( text by himself ) centering on the desert . . . the yield was shrinking , or my interest was . I folded Denby back in place . There was a fat , recent letter from a man in Berkeley  --  I remembered the name , I 'd carried her answer to the mailbox  --  which I started to reach for , then let it go . Bastante , for one session . I closed the portfolio . It looked pristine enough , unless she had planted some secret sign . Knock off , why do n't you , such paranoid shit . She 'd forgotten the letters were there , or trusted me not to explore them , or did n't give a damn if I did . To compound the complexities I 'd let loose by merely opening that Pandora's'box was to go wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather a title did . ( It was always a sign that things were going cerebrally and badly when a title for a story preceded its inception . ) I 'd write something called The Reader . There is this curious fellow , see , whose life was smooth enough until he pried into his lady 's papers and effects . I jotted it down , title and quick summary , into my notebook , glad to be entering something after all this time . My stomach sent an urgent , noisy message ; I boiled some water ,  |p142threw  in two knockwursts and two eggs , went back to her portfolio . I opened it , removed the letter from Tim , took it to the typewriter , and copied it entire . And then I wolfed my lonely dinner . I thought of many things . Like what had become of the cat . What must I look like with mustard in my beard . ( Went to the mirror to check it out : not very bad , in fact , rich yellow daubs smeared across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return so I could write her a letter with my cock , hand-deliver it to her virginal vulva , a mash note from the throbbing present . I made some effort to relax . I 'd lost as good or better through insane jealousy , and not that long before . Such jealousy was insanity , directed at the unalterable tangle of their pasts . Why must a clever fellow like myself live through such madness ? I could n't say , moppingup knockwurst and eggs as the sky darkened . I concluded merely that to fuck them nicely , in particular as they enjoyed it , did not seem the best way to hold them . Consider Christa , consider her Tim . She ran to him for the finale , when Denby yanked his prick from out her warming fires . Indeed , that busy scholar might have had the answer  --  keep them hanging , tactically discontent , so they come dashing back for more . Except , not Christa . Resourceful wench , she would have it both ways . I pictured her racing or hopping ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . She should n't have , it was n't nice . A lady should n't offer her soft , sweet wares to two buyers at a time , whatever her excuses , however timely or basic her confusions about Sex and Love . Covington had framed a doubtful piece of wisdom , once , which ( still embroiledwith Gillian ) I 'd labored to accept . On the strength of countless therapeutic hours with wives whose husbands would not screw them well , or often , or at all , he could assure me that they went for many moons without redress , against the day when the situation with the man of their choice would improve . Uh , uh , Jason , women are different from us . Theyp143channel their prurient itch , which in any case is more diffuse , they do not drop their drawers at the first onset of desire . ( He 's speaking to me on my own level . ) And perhaps , in his experience , it was so . Yet the cases he cited were in wedlock , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Frank  --  though he turned out to have affinities I dared not suspect at the time  --  had not met all the women in the world . I piled the dishes in the sink and cut up some liver for the cat , who was yelling at the back door , then I lay on the rug beneath the afghan and switched on the transistor , meaning to be lulled by world news , but never heard it . The radio was whispering , battery nearly dead , when I woke at half-past nine . I sprang up , bulled around , washed my face and went into the garden . It was windy and cold . I came back in and made up the bed , the outside , single , for the first time in a while . This did n't help my mood . I poured a glass of wine . I drank off half and lit a second cigarette before I dialed . That goddamned miracle . In seconds I was in Baltimore . I spoke briefly to the husband of the house . He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's me ! " She laughed . " I know . " " Did you get there okay ? " " Yes . It 's only Baltimore . " " That 's true , that 's really all it is . Are you having a good time ? " " It 's a little early to tell . Their baby is fairly new . . . it 's a very domestic atmosphere . " " When are you coming home ? " She laughed again . She sounded very pleased and gay . " I do n't know . In a few days . I just arrived . " " Sarkissian . " " What ? "  | " I 'm going to bed . I miss you . Come home soon , babe . " " I 'll telephone , the day I 'm due . " " Good , I 'll probably be in . Unless I 'm spreadeagled on Frank 's couch , or at the AR &P.; Jesus , why did n't I give you the spare set of keys ? Anyway , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , good night . " I polished off the wine . It was only ten o'clock . I felt like going out , though not far . A block down First Avenue was a local , one of those places , plush and rough , which feel hoodlum-run and maybe are . The broads who use them , greyhoundor zoftik platinum-blondes , painted to the eyes , stir up a pile of adolescent fantasies . Or mine . I made sure I had my pocket notebook and a ballpoint pen . I 'd sit at the bar , drink a beer , and jot down whatever came . I 'd been there a few times before but knew no one , as was my custom . It was fairly crowded . I strolled along the bar . A young , short , pimply snot stroked his chin and cheeks and prodded a friend as I went by . I am a man of peace  --  fearful , civilized , what you will . Flight over fight is the motto . Knives and guns apart , these days , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . In Spain , I rose above all sorts of feeble-minded sallies ( " Mira la barba ! Es Castro , verdad ? " ) , and in Sweden as well . Most people are shmucks , you learn to live with that . But unfamiliar things were rumbling in me now . I had turned around and was staring down into his stupid eyes . " You see something funny in having a beard ? " " No , man . " " Then what was this about ? " " I was scratching my chin . " The feebleness of this enflamed me more . Who knows what would have ensued ; scorn and irony , most likely , nothing more ; but I was made aware just then that he was not alone . Not merely for the friend whom he had nudged , who was even frailer , less minatory than he , but for the group of five or sixp145which closed around us . I could see that for the moment they were moved mostly by curiosity . I sensed as well that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " had a beard . " " Moses had one too , did n't he ? " one of the newcomers helped out , a wise bastard . " You 're fucken ey , " I said , and removed myself from danger . At the end of the bar , by the jukebox , was an empty stool . I squeezed in . The bartender arrived directly and I ordered a Schlitz . I eased out my notebook  --  the spirals had caught on the pocket  --  and doodled two three-dimensional boxes , a trick I 'd learned in the third grade . In one I wrote FEAR , in the other RAGE . Let some man of science work it out from there , build on my shoulders . I drank some beer . I willed my heart quiet ; it was breaking sideways from my chest . The bartendercame back . " The kid down the other end wants to buy you a drink . What 'll you have ? " I glanced painfully over . Past a couple of the flashy dames I 'd gone there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or scowled ; neither of us knew which . I think I would have accepted , had I known the protocol . But what was it ? Was I supposed to join them , and struggle to live at their level ? Or drink my free drink surlily , or with a bemused smile , and consider all forgiven ? What did I have to forgive ? If anything at all , could it be obtained so cheaply ? Why was n't I simpler in my mind , or able to let them be ? None of this agonizing , I believed , showed in my face . I turned back to the bartender . " I already have a drink . " I gulped from the glass , left the rest , and used the exit just behind me . This high excitement did some salutary thing ( or else it was the liquor , or the call ) , for I fell straight into bed , glad to have it for myself , and slept right through to morning.  |p146I  phoned her again two nights later , Tuesday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house answered , pointed out that it was dinnertime , suggested brusquely I call back in an hour . I said it was a long-distance call , and he put her on . She was very sweet and warm . She 'd had about enough , she said . She 'd be back the next evening , about this time . I said I would be there . I had forgotten what she looked like ! The features , one by one , I could recall , but no more reassemble than I could my mother 's , five seconds after that good lady walked out the door . And what I did recall I did not trust ; probing her letters and drawings had added a dimension , made her dimmer and larger than life . But when she rang the bell , toting Sarah 's bag , she was the same full , dark-eyed , basically unpretty girl I 'd seen off ( minus maudlin farewells ) at Penn Station , trimmingsand vulvas and methedrine in the Greek isles had changed her no whit in the flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , held her hand , which was cold as out of doors , all the way to the couch , sat her down , plopped down beside her , and asked her how it was . She said that it was not so nice . " I went to the museum one afternoon , which was pleasant . . . the baby seemed a problem , but they were n't getting on terribly well , in any case . Daisy wants to go back and live in Berkeley , but he 's got another year of school . He wo n't let her go off for a visit , either . He spends nearly all day in the library while she 's home caring for the baby . . . " " What 's wrong with that ? " She shrugged . " Something is . I was witness to a dishthrowingscene . . . I do n't think it would have happened if they had n't had the ready-made audience . " " Your friend  --  Daisy  --  threw dishes ? " " No , he did . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had it coming , in a way . She was at him all the time . " " How do you mean ? " " Oh , so many little ways she has of attacking his masculinity . . some rather subtle , some not so . " " Such as ? " " Must I really go into it ? " " No , I guess not . " I could n't say I cared much for her complacent , almost gay assumption of our vulnerability . " Sounds like you had a great time . " She laughed . " Yes . " She took my hand and held it in her lap . The outlook improved . All she 'd meant to do by invoking it was to shut out that shaky world , that crumbling tie , to exalt and protect our ( hers and mine ) sweat-free , perpetual honeymoon . Sure . Bad-mouthing others was bound to save us from their troubles . Yet with what grave consistency she practised the pastime . I could think of no one , in any context , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar-cube friend , as an example , up the road : smiling , warm-voiced , she had described the wife as thin , provincial , dry , but it was not just the wife 's discontent with the arrangement which ended her stay there after a couple of days but some ideological dispute with the host himself  --  he 'd been a serious painter , once , believed in himself and his art , given it top priority , but had become obscurelycorrupted by wedlock , his talent or impulse twisted or lessened . . . she 'd tried to show him how he 'd changed since last they met , he did not take it kindly . . . something of this sort . My memory , as so often , fails me . Yet her manner did conspire in this  --  her fuzzy , sweet , exasperating way of renderingher inner states and ties . A wealth of charm , reasonableness , what seemed even logic suffused her most negative accounts , so that  --  especially if her pauses , omissions were also working well  --  her judgments would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were will-o ' - the- wisp , impoverished by paraphrase , beggaring recall . Which judgment of my own wasp148still in the making at the time . I switched off chez Daisy , or the cogitation it produced , and asked after my own slim volume . Had she had time to read the stories ? Two of them , yes . Had she liked them ? " They were . . . all right . " " All right ? " " Well written . You 're very competent . " " Thank you . Did you receive any other impressions ? " " I ca n't really discuss it now , Jason . I 'm not feeling very verbal . " " Okay , babe . " I regretted , quashed , the rush of irritation . I accepted her rebuke ( the weight of it borne in my name ) . No reason in the world for her to love my prose , nor for me to requireit . Let alone on such short notice . " You want a drink ? " " Sure . " " Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry . " " Nor I. There 's some cheese we can nibble on . " I 'd picked up a pint of Johnnie Walker Black that afternoon and poured it into her Luxembourg fifth . I fixed two drinks , sliced up some cheddar , and brought the repast to the couch . She had let down the tumble of her hair , removed her shoes , tucked her legs in their brown casings beneath her , made some small adjustment to her breasts , and fell to the scotch and cheese . She was home . I desired her . Without the vengeful undercurrents of three nights before . I was naturally better than my worst self , a soothing thing to know . It was time to put some feelings on record , or define them in the attempt . " Sarkissian , " I said softly . " Yes ? " " I do n't know what your long-range plans are , or even if you have any . . . but you 're welcome to stay on here awhile . " She nodded . I saw no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't even sure I wanted one . Let the remark sink in , send out its ripples for a while . She leaned over and picked up the WBAI monthly program guide . She 'd gone through it about a week before , marking off things to listen to , but had got around to very few of them , a circumstance I 'd already teased her about . Now there was a Sean O'Casey play in progress , duly circled in red , and she switched it on . Whichever one it was , we listened to the end . In Ireland and out , the man reminded us , life can be a thorny road , " a r-rough and tawny road . " And later that night , when we went to bed , it turned out a little so . I 'd written some letters to selected friends abroad , she had listened to music and read , and we retired about ten thirty . She made up the bed herself . I entered it first . She was wearing bra and panties when she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissing , and general mood-building , she was responsive enough . But when I slid my hand from knee to crotch , but had hardly touched her there , she flinched , shuddered , as so many of her gestures were large . " Jason , I do n't know if we can . I 've been having some trouble . . . " I said , " We solved that , dear puss . We opened up the pass , " smiling through the sense of dejas vu , still gentle . " This is n't that . This is some other thing . " " Some other thing ? Ah , dear Chris . Dear baby . " For I wanted her badly . I do not think I disbelieved her , but whatevershe had , or had conjured , was not going to withstand my lust and tenderness . And she knew it , too . I fixed her black eyes with my filmy blues , to make a virtue of the very thing she 'd pilloried in her drawing , the hard-nosed male , his urappetite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This way is SOP , they say , or in certain cultures , heaven knows why , precluding as it does all but basic contact , I almost never use it , but it was useful now to look down into her face . She 'd shutp150her eyes , compressed her lips , and was working her pants down over her thighs . I helped them off , overlooking how dutiful she seemed . She was no Victorian lady suffering connubialduties , this much I knew . I opened her legs , looked at her cunt , kissed the high ground , worked the length outside her , insinuated , parted flesh , and eased deliciously inside . Ahhhhh . Four long days had passed . Lust and tenderness I vouch for , even a hint of sacrament in that soft entering , but something more . For I had lived to love again , after renderinga pair of pajamas ready for the laundry well before their time , a modest marathon , twice the night she left and once more in the morning , nursey blondes and fleshy ingenues in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the prostateshrieked its warning . And here I had survived , again , made it to the ritual dip and cleansing . I could have hardly spent the night beside her unfucked in such a frame of mind . So most or all of the importunateness came from here ; I had at least to grant the possibility . But not dwell on it . I worked in slowly , gyrating from the hips , the way Britta had loved it , gauged the way she yielded , then dug straight and hard a moment before she was ready . . . her eyes sprang wide , mouth shaped an 0 , and she thrust up to join me . I had my hands now where I liked them , surrounding those lovely cheeks , face buried in her neck , settling for the job ahead . I hovered on the lip , stroked deep , and held . A few times more . Soon , something else . I planned a leisurely meander through the repertoire . But it was not to happen . With scarcely a warning sign she blasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my shoulders  --  there was barely time to check my choices . I would have liked to see her face ( the light was on ) , but was positioned badly and not really eager to change it . The deeps of her nostrils was all I could manage . Tales of multiple orgasmsto infinity , perpetual readiness , their legendary appetitesshot through my head . But also real chapters from myp151life , in which some of them evinced disinterest right after cominganalogous to the man 's . I did n't care to risk this second possibility , nor did I feel , any longer , especially eager for the first , the lengthy virtuoso scene , and rode in with her on the final wave , scrambled up the shore alone a yard or two , shot forth an endless load , dropped some saliva on the pillow , and groaned out my pleasure . Beached whales , we lay that way awhile . The first thing I saw , looking up , was her water glass , on the night table . She never retired without it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it . " Want some water ? " " No . " She sounded faint and far . " Christa "  --  her name felt strange and clumsy in my mouth  --  " you 're beautiful . You 're the best there is . " When this brought forth no response , I twisted to see her . She was staring straight at the ceiling . Gently I disengaged  --  is this not said to be , for them , a moment of great loss and emptiness ?  --  but she seemed not to know . I lay beside her , looking down . She shook her head violently , covered her face with her hands . Alarmed , I reached out and touched her hair . " What 's wrong ? " " I 'm leaving . " " What ? " " I 'm going away . . . taking leave of my senses . . . oh ! " " Chris , what is it ? What can I do ? " " Nothing . Please . Wait . It feels like I 'm going crazy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was ill-timed . She was as entitled as the next to a spot of madness , but must it follow hard on what was almost a declaration of love ? As my helplessness began to build , and sour , I saw that it was over . She had uncovered her face , which shone with sweat , and was staring once more at the ceiling.  | " Are you all right ? " " I think so . Yes . " " Do you want the light on or off ? " " It does n't matter . You can turn it off . " I went to the toilet . I switched off the lamp on the way back . We lay a moment in silence . I reached for her hand . " Will you be okay ? " " Yes . " " It 's weird , is n't it ? Has this happened to you before ? " " A few times , yes . But it goes away quickly . Good night . " " Oh . . . good night . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asleep in a moment . I bolted up around seven thirty , slipped on a robe , and began typing in the back room . I did n't even put the coffee water on . It was a newly minted dream which had propelled me . I was n't due to see Frank that day , and preferred as a rule to produce them fresh , turds still steaming from the night before , but this one seemed too good to lose . Samuel Beckett was a woman , we were courting . We were seated on a couch . I planned to propose . But I moved in for a premarital taste , we embraced , and the scene faded on the brink , dirtily suggestive , Hollywood style . When the lights came up again we were well married , well into the domestic give-and-take . I t had worked out as well as those things can , but Beckett was blocked , had not written a word in several years . I felt to some degree responsible , and tried to apologize . But Sam said morosely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of love . I made the customary carbon , which I folded into my wallet , and stuck the original into my looseleaf notebook . I put the water on to boil and came back to bed . She was curled to the wall , but I knew she was awake . " The typing disturbed you ? " " Yes . It 's all right . "  | " Sorry , love . I was recapturing a dream . " " Oh . A dream . " " You thought maybe it was the great American novel ? " " I did n't think anything , Jason . " Which was almost certainly true . I was trying to turn her into gadfly and comrade , pussified Socrates  --  who could fault her for turning down the job ? ( And , in the days which followed , I took to setting up a " dream corner , " pencil and index cards on the floor at bedside , so I could jot the mothers down without disturbing either one of us , without involving the creative noise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sacramento tomato juice , which is the best there is  --  and we ate out on the porch , facing the dormant garden , for the Februarymorning was behaving like June . Afterwards she washed up , the breakfast dishes and the load left in the sink , and went off to check her mail and buy some art supplies . I asked her to drop a pile of wash , mostly mine , at the launderette . I pushed some papers , then really worked an hour or two . I was playing darts and drinking coffee when the telephone rang . It was my agent . She had just sold my book of stories to a publisher in Sweden . I 'd had some thought of returning to the typewriter after lunch , but this buoying news ended the working day . I went out to pick up the laundry . The runty man there knows me , or the pillowcase I use as laundry bag , which has a flowery border . We rarely exchanged more than the necessary syllables , but this time he smiled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very lovely wife . I took as much pleasure in his praise of her as in informing him I was not married . Feeling very high , I rang up Paul when I got back and invited myself for lunch . We used a quart of wine , at least , to wash down the Pisacano special . Of Christa he said , " She 's a winner , man . She 's really in your corner . She 's the best I ever saw you with . " To which I replied that he had never laid eyes on Twenty-sixth Street . Or not , I amended , so far as Ip154knew . He took real pleasure in my afterthought , rocked back with wild guffaws , and repeated his opinion of how screwed up I was . I staggered home and slept , making sure to leave the chain unhooked . I heard her come in , but could n't stir for twenty minutes more . Then I showered , shaved around the beard , and she cooked up some lamb ragout she 'd come back with the ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had emptied the laundry bag and put my unmentionables in their proper drawers , which pleased and unnerved me more . My editor phoned after dinner , from somewhere in the Village , and I invited him by . He came with his wife . We talked and drank into the night . Christa had met them before , but had been rather shy . Now she loosened up , chatted freely with the wife , mostly about California . Allan phoned me in the morning , on some other matter , and said what a good woman she was . When I hung up I turned to the bed . " That was Allan . " " Who ? " she said sleepily . " Seeman . My editor . " " Oh . " " He was extravagant in his praise . " " Of what ? " " You , babe . My laundryman , my editor , my neighborhood buddy , they all think you 're the greatest thing that ever happened . What do you do to them ? " She yawned , shrugged , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I probably charmed them . " " Wow . Yes . You really did . " And minutes later , chances are , I did a thing I loved , which was watch her move through the world of my rooms in her underwear . Those rounded hips , narrow sloping shoulders , full boobs and thighs  --  Jesus , she was fair . To come up behind her while she gazed half-naked in the mirror was to havep155it all . I made the error once of saying so . She disputed , told me how much thinner , trimmer she 'd been in olden times , like two years before . In her own opinion now her ass was much too large , overall physique unique and odd , dated at best ( she called it " pear-shaped " ) , one breast slightly larger than its mate ( and what mother 's son with an imbalanced scrotum even gave a shit if this was true ? ) , feet ugly , dimples due to missing muscles , nose unmentionable . A wreck , overall . " You make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your prime . Or one of your primes . They say around thirtyfiveis the best . " " That 's when you begin to chase seventeen-year-old boys . " " Yeah , I suppose it is . " And one evening , as she sketched , out of my own deep perversity , I asked her why she did n't draw me . If I had a drink in hand , I said , I 'd sit for her forever . " I have drawn you . " " You have ? " There was no need to feign surprise , for I had n't thought she would admit it . " When ? Can I see it ? " " No , not yet . It 's . . . part of a series . I 'll show it to you when it 's completed . " She was so much more skilled a dissembler than myself . I had the feeling she knew I 'd been into her things ; she 'd looked long ( if in passing ) at her portfolio of letters the night she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . Perhaps she was really doing a series ? I hoped not . Indian temple sculpture would pale beside . " And you do n't need me to sit for you ? " She did not . There were times , she said , when she preferred to work from memory . Indeed there were . Most often in bed , or else late at night , on the rug , lubricated by the wine , she went on gleaning . PossiblyI would have discouraged it if I had thought of an easy way . But probably not . I cut down my questioning , I evenp156tried to turn it now and then if she went on too long or fondly about Tim , but I did n't begrudge her , on the whole , a serious , listening air . I was the girl friend , the brother she had never had . And should this seem to reek of virtue , as it does to me , the approach gave me still one more way to possess her . By weighing , reassembling all she volunteered with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd finally be able to surround . . . what ? her basic mystery ? anything I really needed ? I learned during this time that the abortion she 'd already described had been her second . Compared to the tale she told now , the Tangier trip was an African holiday . She 'd come by the first right after her MFA , while supporting herself with some part-time job . Tim was not in town . Denby was , but his peculiar habits made it possible for her to pinpoint the man as one she worked with , a mere one-night stand ( I clucked and shook my head in disbelief and sympathy ) . His subsequent desires , as with George in Madrid , she did not make clear . Tim returned in ample time to undertake his shuttling chores . They drove to Tijuana , armed with a doctor 's name and address . The trouble began right over the border , when they stopped to ask directions . They felt they were being tailed , decided that this was unlikely , and went on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They chatted , wary but amiable , got to the point , money changed hands , she had just gone off to undress when the police burst in . They roughed up the doctor , insulted her , threatened Tim with jail . They confiscatedmost of the money , for some reason not all . They escortedthem back to the border . They drove all night to San Francisco . In the morning she boarded a plane , alone , for Seattle . She had the operation there . She was airborne again within the hour , not even feelingbad , or much of anything at all , groggy from the anesthetic , in mild shock.  |p157I  found myself wondering who footed the bill for all these escapades . She drifted again to her recent travels , concentrating on Italy , a young man she 'd known there , somewhat younger than herself , inordinately handsome , not especially bright , who squired her to places she would not otherwise have seen . That he 'd screwed her as well I automatically assumed , though she had the goodness not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had spent twenty minutes alone with any adult male in all her nubile life without fucking him , too . I had worked up by then substantial fellow-feeling for Tim , who was hooked on a most extraordinary lady , a life-force run wild , and something more insidious than fellow-feeling : I 'd begun to see how he could do it . One must take great pains not to follow in those footsteps . Drunk , in the saddle , one did not believethere was much danger . One even tried to be sporting . Let her have her dashing Antonio , young Italian stud ; that , after all , was what so many of them went to Europe for . With her buddy down the block , however , quarrel or no , I must have handled it less well ; the real proximity could have botheredme , and I ventured too close to home . " If you 're asking whether I ever slept with him , Jason , the answer is yes . " Looking and sounding very put upon . " I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you volun-teer ? " Two safe years before , her aimless , pre-Europe , fathermourningjourney to New York . Her mother , from whom letters now came regularly , she described as fat , complicated , wise . ( Her most gentle portrayal so far . ) I countered with tales of mine , less flattering . Once , when Martha phoned me , I held the receiver a distance from my ear so Christa could share my dismay at the nervous , strident tones . Then one Thursday morning , our fourth week plus a day ,  |p158Leslie  phoned long distance , collect , from her Cape Cod boarding school . Instinctively I went to take it in the back room , and I kicked shut the door . " Jason , it 's Leslie . " " Hello , little one . " " Are you alone ? " " Yup . " " Are you sure ? " " Sure I 'm sure . You think someone sleeps here every night ? You think I 'm running a hotel ? " " I do n't know . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see you . " Delivered on a childish , nice , peremptory note , as if she thought she had a right . I decided she did . Minor literary figures in their thirties should not seduce however eager seventeensunless they 're prepared to bear some extralegal risks . And that eager she had not been anyway . It was on our second date . I took her home around two , chatted with the pair until her mother liquefied herself to bed , then we nestled in on the couch . I was her first author , her very first beard , she was ready for some heavy , hairy necking , but she drew the line at her pants . Since I knew she was no virgin , I became judiciously outraged . I took it very personally . I promised to withdraw from her life until such time as she grew up . She could drop me a line when she thought that had happened . I put on my jacket and my coat . She followed me to the door . We taxied back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see you too , Les . Call me when you get in . " I asked Frank that afternoon what he thought I ought to do . " What do you want to do ? " " See her , lay her , I do n't know . Keep her on the fire , really , for some other time . I ca n't have her over the house , and I do n't want to spend the night away , even if we could get herp159goddamn mother out . Do n't be such a nondirective bastard . Give me a little advice . " " Uh . . . tell her your sister and brother-in-law are in town and staying in your apartment . " " My sister . . . ? Hey , that 's great . Then even if she phones when I 'm out and Christa answers , I 'm covered . From Leslie 's end , anyway . And I would n't have to see her at all , or only for lunch . Frank , you 're a master . " So on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , I was an indifferent strategist , or felt one then , but maybe I could pull it off . From Covington 's office I went to a tavern , had several draft beers , looked through the evening paper , and ceased to worry . I got home around six . We 'd left the house together that afternoon , stopped at the shoemaker 's , then ridden the First Avenue bus uptown . She was n't back yet . I opened a quart of Ballantine Ale , switched on WLIB , jazz , the Billy ' I'aylor show , fed the cat , cleaned his box , and turned to MurrayKempton 's column , which I had saved for last . It shaped up as a civilized evening . The steak I had removed before we left was defrosted ; she could cook it , when she got back , or , should there be some festivity in the air , we would go out for dinner and the steak would keep . When she was n't in by seven , and I 'd polished off the quart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sprinkled them with Parmesan , and fed myself . She arrived while I was mopping up . She hung her coat in the back room , came and sat on the couch . I joined her there . She looked weary and unhappy . " Where 've you been , my love ? " " Out , around , picking up my mail . " " How 'd you make out ? " " Not very well . Just one letter from my brother-in-law . . . Jason , I 've got to leave for California . " " What ? Why ? When ? " Whence  --  shocked as I truly was  --  this odd desire to smile ? " Tomorrow . My sister Jane is having a nervous thing , ap160breakdown , if they still call it that . They want me to be there . " " The sister in California ? The one you said was a square ? " " Yes . What does that have to do with it ? " " Nothing . They flip out too , I guess . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . they want me there , I have to go . " " What are you doing for money ? " " My relatives are meeting me at the terminal . They 've bought the ticket . " " What time must you go ? " " The plane leaves at nine thirty in the morning . " " Christa , I have to adjust to this . You must leave ? " " Yes . " " Right . Okay . It 's too bad , dear . We were just getting acquainted . " " Yes , that 's true . " " Christa . " " What ? " " Will you be coming back ? " " Yes . " " How long will you be away ? " " I 've no way of knowing , yet . I 'll call you when I know . " " Right . Anyway , you have to come back . We just brought those boots in to be reheeled . " Not even sexy , low , worn , European things , for which she claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The shoemaker had shaken his head , that afternoon , but promised us his best . " The boots do n't matter , " she said . " Sure the boots matter . " " Oh , all right , they matter . " Soon after she went to pack . When I followed her a bit later to inspect , grieve at the portents of departure , I noticed she had left a thing or two  --  a blouse , a dress  --  hanging in the closet . Sign or oversight , I let it sustain me.  |p161Ah  what prodigies of love we made on the eve of our parting . Perhaps . Love we made , I know , but ca n't dredge up the mood or quality . In the morning , not . I woke first ( she had turned out to be , if left alone , a fairly late riser ) , around seven , before the alarm . I remembered to shut it , put up coffee , and took a shower before I roused her . I wanted a leisurely departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and feeling , all in all , fairly good to feel this bad . I followed her around while she dressed , came up behind while she stood at the mirror , watched myself kiss her neck , surround her box , nuzzle her hair . She bore it awhile . " Jason , I 'll be late . " " No fear , love . It 's only half-past seven . " But I went and dressed . Coffee and tea was all we had . " Goddamn it , Sarkissian , back to washing dishes all by my-self . " " An old bachelor like you must be used to it . " " I 'm not that old . Anyway , I adapted quickly to the new re-gime . " And then there was nothing left to do . I carried her heavy valise into a crisp , blue February morning . We walked toward First Avenue . The old Italian cobbler , early at his last , waved as we went by . Christa waved back . I 've been down that street a thousand times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But my shoes seldom seem to need repair . The East Side Air Terminal on Thirty-eighth Street was our destination . I tried for a cab on the corner , without success . It was drawing near the morning rush hour , and New York cabbies , . is we know , go off-duty en masse during the rush hour . At best they play the pointing game , point imperiously where they 're going , toward their beds , and if you find that direction congenialyou 'll nod and point in turn and they may let you join them . Some expecting gratitude , others not  --  they 're men of several temperaments . The pointing problem , anyway , we didp162not have , since First Avenue ran only north . The off-duty signs kept winking by . I led her toward the bus stop . There was ample time to take a bus , but I wanted her alone these final moments , just as I was not really eager to prolong them . I placed her on the queue and stepped back into the gutter . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . I signaled him , did so again when the light turned green , and he came sliding up . I opened the door and beckonedto Christa . She arrived just as did a tall well-dressed man who tore up from the corner . He was wearing a hat . It was reasonenough to despise him . " What the hell do you think you 're doing ? That 's my cab . I hailed him at the corner . " " Get in , " I said to her . I half pushed her into the cab . " Get out , " he said . She did n't move . He stuck his head in the front window . " You saw me at the corner , did n't you ? " The little Puerto Rican barely shrugged , stared ahead . " Man , get another one , " I said . " We have to catch a plane . " " Get the hell out of my cab . " I thought he was going to put his hands on her . I slammed the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a signal to the cabbie , who sped away . He stopped at the next traffic light , though for a moment it did not seem he was going to . The light was green . That would have been an exit  --  Sarkissian speeding up First Avenue , her suitcase , which we 'd both forgotten , waiting on the queue , himself pugilistically engaged with some prick of a company lawyer to whom he gave away six inches and forty pounds . Not that his size was an issue just then . Midget or giant I would have laid him out , or tried to , had he touched her . It was an unusual feeling . I started toward the cab , but some people on the queue called me back for the valise . A bus pulled in just then , cutting me off . I raced around the front of it and picked up her bag . Time enough for that irate son of a bitch , true spawn of the city , to cover thep163distance , yank her to the pavement by her auburn hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had faded . I lurched up and climbed in . The driver moved off . A red light stopped us a few streets up . " I do n't know , " the hackie said . " Not his cab . I stop for you . " Well , fuck you too , amigo . Speak when it matters or hold your tongue . I mumbled some remarks at Christa , apologies for or putdowns of my countrymen , but could n't look at her . I was being ripped in half . A pair of buzzsaws worked toward each other through the center of my body . This eased a little by the time we drove up the ramp . She fumbled genuinely in her purse , but I would n't let her pay . She exited on the left , the curb side , and I came dragging the suitcase after . She was already cloaked in distance , fearfully remote ; I surmised she was as eager as I to have it ended here . If I ran into her relativesshe would have to explain me away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dropped the bag at the foot of the escalator , gripped her shoulders and kissed her . " Have a good journey , love . I ca n't think what else to say . Too bad you 're leaving . It 's not my idea . " I began to feel teary . " Goodbye , " she said . We stared another second . When the helplessness began to build , and take over my face , I turned and left her . I walked the mile back , along Second Avenue . I slowed past Gillian 's block , peering also the other way , toward the river , iu case she was just coming off night duty at the hospital . Near the end of it , when I was no longer privileged to see them , she told me she had painted her privates gentian , administering to herself for the monilia she more than implied I had myself induced , and maybe it was so . But bear in mind she was the type who thinks she has contracted ringworm from her cats . Locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that purple pussy , to kiss and make it well ! I chuckled at the memory as I walked by her street . I strained to put a wry face on my confu/sion . Scheming my guts out to fit Leslie in , or put her inventivelyoff  --  it was no problem now . She 'd probably phone today . I 'd see her , no question . At Twenty-third I went into a sandwich bar , suddenly ravenous for an ethnic sandwich , as Jane Mason has it ( lantzman on her mother 's side ) , cream cheese with lox on rye . I skipped the coffee . I was full of coffee . Then I went home . I had left open the door which led to the porch . I 'd never forgotten to shut it and bolt it before . But no one had robbed me in the hour I was gone . The puss tried to join me in the john , but I edged him out . I looked keenly forward to the first wholly private session since late in January , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mastered ease in all the time she lived there ( arid drunk and consequently diarrhetic the few days she was in Baltimore ) , nor very often , in shared quarters , in my life ; a fair argument , itself , for bachelorhood . It 's the acoustics which bother me . Everyone shits , to be sure , but why advertise ? I see my mother 's prissy hand in this , for what succor that brings . And I was moving very well indeed , body restored to and relishing its rhythms , beginning , middle , and waiting for the final drop , when the telephone rang . It was ten minutes past nine . No one ever called me this early . I imagined the worst . Would my sister get the bulk of the estate ? It would be only just . Though I had n't wished so irreversible a fate on them for many years . I 'd have ( to make the best of it ) a funeral to observe and file away . I 'd been to only one in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seventeen years before , and needed refreshing for the set piece I might one day be called upon to do . The phone rang a third time . Already cheated of perfection by the summons , I decided to answer . With a shorts-hampered shuffle , paper crammed between my cheeks , I got there on the fifth ring . " Hello ? " " Hello . "  | " Ah , sweet puss . Where are you ? " At the airport . " " Christa , it 's so lonely here . The apartment is so empty " I know , " she said . Then , incredibly tender : " It 's only for a while . " " Listen , call me when you get there . I mean in a day or two . What 's today , Friday ? I 'll be away over the weekend . . . " I had told her this , that I was going to unwind at my agent 's Connecticut farm , so she would not be apt to phone while Lesliewas here . " Call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , wait , I teach on Monday night . What 's the time differential . . . shit , call me Tuesday . " " Yes . I must go now , Jason . " " Goodbye , my love . " " Goodbye . " I was enormously happy as I hobbled back to the toilet.  |p169SO  LET THERE BE  --  THERE WAS  --  AN INTERLUDE , while the miss is missing , her strong right leg just visible as she strides out of the frame . And Sams ' life balloons , protrudes , and gushes from the canvas . She 'll come back , no fear : the way will be paid , she 'll know that her departure had been inopportune . But for the moment I could entertain . Martha phoned again that Friday , around noon . She wondered how I was ; I assured her I was well . She said she had n't seen me or been on the receiving end of a telephone call in several weeks ; I explainedI had been busy . She made an understanding noise . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew . And myp170recent successes had of course imposed fresh obligations . I must have sounded more congenial than I felt , for she went on to indulge a nostalgic mood . She 'd tried to write me a letter about this mood the night before , but held off mailing it , and was embarrassed by it in the morning . The gist was this . She had been rummaging through my effects  --  baby pictures , lettersI wrote while in the army , medals from junior high school , etc . The medals had engaged her the most . I 'd been brilliant even as a youth , she and Harry acknowledged it so little . She wished there was a way to make it up . It was clear she had been bugging him about it . At this point in either of our lives we needed her misplaced remorse not at all . But I did n't have it in me to cut her off . She made a jerky transition to the first book she 'd ever bought , with her first paycheck , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She clutched it home in a state of high excitement . She must have known I knew the background well  --  that her father yanked her out of school at fifteen years of age and sent her off to dismal labors , despite that teachers journeyed to the tenement on Cherry Street and begged him to let her continue , but he stood firm , and she claimed all these decades later to appreciate his motives , defended ( in other situations ) his wisdom and compassion , but had never forgiven him for wrenching her life out of line , nor too many of the rest of us , either . Anyway , from this bent in her , which was ( after all ) transmitted through her father , since her mother was illiterate , and from our early readings together in The Wind in the Willows , had come , such as it is , my own deep love of literature . I did n't argue . As she went on , Dreiser 's book became confused with the one I had given her for her most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landowska , and this in turn with the one I had myself published . I feared we were headed for an emotional moment . But I should have known she would be at least as eager to avoid one . She jumped quickly to the news . She had extracted much joy that morning from an item in The Times . Some Ger/man junge menschen had gone to one of the Scandinavian countries to rebuild a synagogue destroyed in the war . With their own money and hands . This partial intelligence thrilled her , the whole gayishe world rose a notch in her estimation . My ear was growing stiff and wet . I was reminded of the time ( unless that happened afterwards ) she tried to share with me , also on the phone , her excitement that the Pope had cleared the Jews in the death of Christ . She was really grateful . My reaction was : It 's a holding action ! Their backs are to the wall ! And this time too I would have rather heard about Landowska , or my medals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reacting to these noble German youth despite myself . The overweight shvuntzes in their lederhosen , all over Europe , ruining Spain . Even their beautiful women had a fatness , a spiritual grossness about them . Such a narrow perspective on the youth of a nation was far from rational . It must have been connected with my shaky views on the six million . Once , around the time my book came out , I was invited by the editor of a parochial monthly , which aspires and claims to be more , to review a book they had just received on the Warsaw Ghetto . I knew bupkas about the Warsaw Ghetto . But I was Jewish , I was a writer , so they assumed I was both interestedand qualified . I fired back a note much too angry for the circumstances . It got me labeled , around the office , as one of the self-hating Jews . There may be something to it . I certainly tend to seek my themes and postures elsewhere . Covington is of the opinion that my reactions to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , are significant and suppressed . He is almost certainly right . He also holds the view , more subtly expressed , that I ought to be dealing with these reactions here , in this supposedly gutclearingvolume . Its possible I read him wrong . He is firm , as a rule , whatever his reasons , about withholding life advice , let alone literary . He lets you go your way , make your own mistakes , then listens sympathetically while you explain howp172you blew it . But all right , Frank . Just on the chance . My father still wears a yarmulkah at table , a white silk filigree he pinched from some wedding or bar mitzvah . My mother blesses the Sabbath candles . I used to have to take the long way home from Hebrew School to avoid being roughed up by polacks , wops , and other lesser breeds . Okay . You write your book , I 'll write mine . One thing I learned from Covington was , where Martha was concerned , to swallow the impulse to dissent . To enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or debate the judgment posterity is likely to make on the works of Sholom Aleichem , was to reopena profounder argument . I had as little chance of winning it now as when I was six months old , perhaps a trifle less . So I listened . Finally she got to the point , invited me for dinner , leaving the date open , with the hard , tight chuckle meant to be charming . " You 're always welcome here , you know that . . . " which I read as You live less than a mile away , you have no wife , and yet we hardly ever see you , I suppose there are reasons , you 're a busy man , with a difficult temperament , yet no one lives forever . . . but it was impossible to assess where the guilt and pathos lay , in her head or in mine . A lady equal parts bewildered and bewildering . To me . My sister Ann , who met her nine years later , understands her better and loves her dearly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped to the Midwest , with young husband , blind Bassett hound and small male child . She and her husband teach at the university level . She has her mother 's nervous laugh , her ungainliness , but seems to think more clearly . She 'll hover near tears when I press an attack , impugn Martha 's brains or character . ( But I have learned to bite back that pointless impulse too . ) Martha made the most hideous efforts to prevent Ann 's marriage . But , after all , failed . So I suppose there is room for charity . Though seeming always poised on the brink of hysteria , at least in my loaded presence , my sister must be tougher thanp173she seems . And with real toughness may come gentleness . And with gentleness , ability to forgive . And with forgiveness , the possibility of love . " Are you two doing anything tonight ? " " No . " " Why do n't you drop over ? " " Tonight ? You 're sure you 're free ? We would n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dad does n't get home until six . " " Come after dinner . " " Would you like to join us for dinner ? " " I have a dinner date . " " Oh . So what time shall we come ? " " Seven thirty ? Eight ? " Stiff , flirtatious , coy , truly happy , she said , " Fi-ine . " I rang off . My invitation surprised me as much as it must have done her , but I did n't really regret it . I looked forward to a visit , if also a little beyond it , to the moment of departure . My thoughts strayed to the possible bounty  --  a bag of fruit , a hooked rug , a bottle of scotch . ( " We do n't like to come emptyhanded . " ) My right eye began to hurt . Did it mean another bout with my eye disease ? Sometimes , through will power , I could head them off . But an attack was about due . They had begun in London , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University Ilospital 's clinic they misdiagnosed it as conjunctivitis and sent me home with medication which rendered it still more Ihotophobic and inflamed . I returned . They altered the diag -- iosis to iritis of indeterminate origin . Cortisone kept it quiet , atropine dilated and relaxed it , it ran its course in several weeks . In 1963 it shifted to the right eye , where it remains , and blossoms about four times a year . Doctors , off and on ,  |p174have  thought to connect it with the drip . Their eyes light up . They think I may be suffering from Reiter 's Syndrome , about which not too much is known . It describes the serial occurrenceof eye trouble , prick trouble and arthritis . They could never locate what they held to be responsible , a microorganismcalled PPLO , nor have I ever had arthritis , which is said to make its appearance some time between the other two , and in a shorter span than the six years it took me to go from one to the other , but they kept hoping . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood , allergies , smears , the works , before they lost interest . I was sorry to have let them down . My own interest remained high . Blind ! Impotent ! Writer 's Syndrome ! I did some light housecleaning  --  mopped the toilet floor , washed the dishes , hand-picked some lint off the rug . I emptiedthe ashtrays , which turned up a few stray Marlboros , Christa 's . I was not really convinced she had n't stepped around the corner , to Amex , to the A &P.; I was still half listening for the key ( she had taken it with her ) in the door . Around five I opened a gallon of the Spanish sauterne with which I sometimes changed off the zinfandel , poured a glass , and sat down to forge a link . I calculated whether she 'd still be airborne ; no . Out of the sky at least two hours . Only two in the afternoon , California time . I wondered what she was doing , whether she 'd seen her sister yet . I gulped some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red , antic cat on an all-purpose card which had the word Greetings rather inconveniently placed inside , I wrote her the following , which I 'm obliged to reinvent , since I kept neither carbon nor draft , as I did one or the other for almost all the rest . Feb 19 Dear Christa , This will be a long day for you , it suddenly occurs to me . It 's five pm , I 'm drinking wine.  |p175Miss  you fiercely ; I guess this was the way to find out . GREETINGSOf what use you can be to your sister in the midst of a nervous breakdown I 've yet to figure out . You were doing your share of good works right here . But , the white makes me waspish ; good luck , godspeed , a quick return , Love , Tawny RhodesBasically so . I may have the ending wrong . Martha and Harry visited that night . Leslie phoned me that afternoon . I asked her to come for dinner the following evening . Saturday morning I called Paul and invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bring a lady . My own has split for the coast on family matters , but there 'll be another . Groovy , father . He offered to bring the wine . Arrangements made , I braved snow flurries to the A &P,; bought the ingredients for a beer stew , and started its leisurely preparation around two in the afternoon . I threw together a large mixed salad . By five the stew was cooking nicely , and on a superfluous quart of beer , plus Old Overholt , I was bubblingfairly well myself . I 'd told Leslie to turn up at half-past six , for a moment 's private audience , Paul at seven . Around six , with time grown short , I gave in to the impulse I 'd been quashing since the morning , when it was too early to act on because earlier still where she was , and then kept delaying throughout the day , for what seemed even better reasons . She 'd gone too far this time ( California was not Baltimore ) to be loved and pursued via the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Improvident to blow one 's cool . But a few boilermakersworked wonders on the forebrain . I turned down the I adio , which had been improving me all day with Mozart , Bach and Brahms , arranged my drinks , an ashtray , my addressp176book around me on the rug , and dialed the ten-digit number she had left , her mother 's in Atherton . Her sister was in a nearby town , but Christa would be staying with her mother . There were clicks and buzzes , then a hopeful silence which became real dead air . I broke the connection and dialed again . I got through this time . From the opening hello I understood what voice and cadence she had been avoiding , what dark and liquid foreignnessshe 'd shaped her style against , and I was impressed again with what a lovely instrument she 'd made of the compromise . " May I speak to Christa , please ? " " Who 's calling ? " " A friend in New York . " " Christa is in New York . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be true . " Uh , no , I think she may have gone back to California . " " Is that so ? Then most probably she 's traveling by bus . Do you know what day she left ? " " No , I do n't . . . but she should be there soon . Well , thank you . " " Would you like to leave a message ? " I decided I would . The message was that Jason Sams had called . S-A-M-S . If she recognized the name , as she must have , since she used it on her mail , she gave no sign . She promised to convey it . I hung up feeling vindicated , blue . Feeling vindicated  --  treacheryafoot ?  --  contributed not a little to feeling blue . I was not , just then , going to think too deeply on it . My West Coast geography was nonexistent . It might have been a long way from San Francisco , where she had landed , to her mother 's home . That the woman did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd in the purported circumstances . . . but since this was the case , there had to be an explanation for it . Not to worry . A new evening lay ahead . The stew de/-Handed my attention . I made the salad dressing . I set the table . There was time to sit around when I was done . Leslie came half an hour late . She was sorry . She had been held up by a long instructional from her mother 's beau of the moment on the risks of taking up with older men who might , for all one knew , be interested in one only for one 's body . He was not sayingthis was so in the present instance , only that she should move with caution . Without rancor , I suggested that he leched after her himself ( I 'd met him ) , and she agreed that this was so . She 'd been sitting on his lap through most of the peroration . Pisacano descended a moment later with a large and large-lipped girl who taught high school English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sent her in to ring the bell , as was his peculiar custom , while he was parking the car . There was an awkward moment while I tried to imagine who she was , the type of moment he clearly relished causing even though he could n't witness the result . He appeared at last with a jug of wine , a loaf of round pig bread , and tramped around the small apartment , infusing it with his presence , criticizing this and that  --  the way I made no real use of the porch , the absence of a genuine bed  --  till I sat him down at the table and began the meal . Leslie was helpless , as well as my guest ; I ( lid it all . Soon I looked to Pisacano for a judgment . I always rated his own productions piece by piece  --  spinach of a good consistency , cheddar sauce a little winey , etc.  --  and he most often agreed . The stew was on the fatty side , he said , salad dressing was a masterpiece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close enough . His date tried to upstage this orgy  --  " When do you two exchange recipes ? "  --  but without success . She wound up talking to Leslie about teaching , trying not to patronize the child , while Paul and I continued our manly discourse . Baseball , the coming season , figured large . The evening was a great success . I remembered almost nothing of it in the morning . The first thing to come back , as I found Les/lie , not Christa , beside me , was the endless screwing of the night before . I was much too drunk to come in any normal length of time , not drunk enough to forgo the thing entirely ; so fucked her interminably , through wet seasons and dry , and even then may not have made it , as I doubt that she did either . ( Later she would write me from the cape , describing what her classmates or her mother or someone called " honeymooner 's complaint , " directly traceable to this ' encounter ; seemed rather pleased by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the morning . Or toward noon . She was in discomfort even then , but as reluctant as myself to misuse our limited time . We lay about drinking coffee in exhausted aftermath . She ran through some shocking stories of life at the little girls ' school . The telephone rang . I reached down and picked it up , instead of journeying to the extension inside . It was Sarkissian . I felt like a jam-smeared child . My face , my tone , were bound to give the game away , but I tried to keep the content vague for Leslie 's sake or mine , while yet conveying to Christa how glorious it was to hear , and damping her suspicions , should she have them , that I had spent the second night following her departure anything but alone . It was nine in the morning her time . I phoned you , I said . She said she knew . She had arrived at her mother 's late the night before . She had been hiding out in Berkeley all day Friday and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resources before facing the ordeal . Of course . I asked her if she needed any money . I meant for passage back , but could n't spell it out . She said no , she would manage . I told her of the note I 'd written on Friday . She said she would be looking forward to it . Reluctantly I hung up , trying to stone-face through the rosy glow . I 'd been protecting Leslie , right , though if she 'd made a scene of any sort I would have bitten her head off . But she was cool . Did n't even ask me who it was . So I volunteered it  --  an old friend from California . Hoping she would see safety in the miles.  |p179We  ate at Arthur 's Corner . I dispatched her in a prepaid cab . I saw her once more before she went back to school . Paul rang up around four . " Hey , is Boston over there ? " " Who ? " " The chick from last night . She disappeared herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who knows , father ? It looked like she dug you . " " Nobody here but me , Pisacano . " " Groovy . If she turns up give me a buzz . " " What did you do to her ? " " Nuthin ! She just split . I think she might have felt neglected . " " How could that be ? You 're such an attentive fucker . " " Yeah . Later . " He hung up . I poured myself a glass of wine . It was not the first intima-t ion I had ever had that one of the things lacking in Paul 's life was a Pisacano , and that from time to time he would assign me the role ; it was important to sidestep , and usually I managed , but now , for the moment , I let myself be flattered by the image . It had been a busy weekend after all : I 'd fucked a child , I 'd talked long-distance with a lady . I thought of some of the things Gardella had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acned , scrawny childhood , a so-i ial and athletic misfit , spurned in adolescence by the gang on the corner , beginning to blossom in his twenties but wiped ( nit by too-early marriage to the imperious Jewish beauty ; saved by divorce , grown dago-handsome , heavier , a burgeoningarchitectural career , swelling head , new vindictive way with ladies . . . his bluster , career , artistic ambitions , finan-i ial greed , multiple screwing , all in some manner traceable to the skinny , pimply childhood . Whether Dino tended more toward such simplistic etiology after he began seeing Covingtonthan before , when he 'd been prone enough , I could n't say . I here had to be some shorthand way for two such ancientp180friends to handle each other . And Dino was just as easy for Paul . Self-proclaimed writer , middle-class bullshit artist , schoolteacher , bard of Pelham Parkway . . . nostalgia , according to Paul , was at the heart of their tie . There was another piece of data for which I had Dino to thank  --  what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had never seen one . Gardella described them this way : " It 's fantastic , horrible , the way his face puffs up in a couple of seconds . He ca n't even talk , because his tongue gets swollen also . You know how that got started ? It 's a wild story . I gave him this broad 's phone number about a year ago , she was around six feet one inches tall and she had one tit . He calls her up , bangs her the first night , and he comes down with the clap . He tries to pin it on me , but I never caught anything off of her . They give him penicillin , and he first finds out he 's allergic to it . That 's when his face blows up , and he breaks out in a rash all over his body . So they lay the antidote on him and they cure the dose with something else . But then , here 's the bit , after that he gets the same reaction without penicillin , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Struck by the perception that his life was empty or ugly or disorderly , some sudden breakdownin wheeling and dealing , some social mess or risk . . . it had taken his anxiety thirty-six years to find a set of symptomswholly to its liking , and there would be no parting his body from them now . How much more direct than my own tentative fumbling with mild eye and genital disease ! I polishedoff the wine and poured myself another glass . I hunted up my pocket notebook and scrawled : " Psyche , soma , sickness , Paul . " Then I drained the second glass of wine . I would soon be past it , so I mothered myself into dinner : a can of tuna , raw onion , mayonnaise . I teased and stroked and manhandled the puss ; he hissed , made to flee , flattened his ears , raked at me with claws concealed , gave in and purred when I stroked hisp181throat and belly . He , at least , had adjusted to ambivalence . This was not the price of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some dry food . It was one of the rare occasionson which I 'd bought the Sunday Times ( usually I waited for a discard ) ; perhaps the whole day had been building towardthis moment . I extracted the magazine section from that preposterous hulk , doused some lights , pulled the drapes and settled in . I checked the table of contents just on the chance , but it was an ordinary Sunday , no distractions , nothing remotelyinteresting to read . So I turned my full attention to the ads ; for these , it was a very good week indeed . Crotches were in abundance , legs , at least , on every page -- pouting , pajamaed ingenues , broads leaning on Klopman , the tender , widehippedmother smiling at her little girl ( one for the kinks ! ) in matching panties , season-rushing bathing suits , a terrible treasurechest . There seemed enough to squander . I raced through , three or four strokes per display , noting in passing which were most tempting to revisit , if I was being profligate , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classified ads for private schools , beyond which , experience taught , lay nothing , and I closed the magazine and stripped off my clothes . Good ; within limits , now , it was like starting over . My prick was slightly raw ; I stroked the scrotum this time round . No way to turn the page , so I zeroed in on the bathing suits , a two-page spread . Nine ladies in a row , posing their hearts out , limbs extended and contorted in thirty thousand ways , some even had boobs , something to appeal to the red-blooded fantasistin any man , and I blasted off right into the magazine , covering them with glory . The idea of using a condom , for neatness ' sake , had occurred , but was lost in the heat of the iiioment . Well , it was done , it had n't been bad , and I made ready to fend off the recriminations which would follow . In Fact , they were weaker than usual . I took a symbolic , pointless shower . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I putp182on pajamas , pulled out the bed and retired with my radio , tuned to the station which gave continuous news , soothing sagas of stabbings in the Bronx , possible worldwide detentes . Then I slept , from eight until two . At two A.M. I coped with reality as it manifested at that hour , with grunts and moans , wave on wave of loathing , jerked off again , showered again , tossed until four and slept until seven . Monday was shot . I had lived a certain way for almost thirty-three years , my life was not then subject to dramatic change . Feb. 23Dear Jason it 's high noon , You are quite right to feel the hurt I heard in your voice . It was altogether the wrong moment to leave you . Compulsion . . . The wife of young Jay Gould is in the throes of wanting something she 's never known and as it looks will never have unlessshe becomes a kind of Mrs. Hyde and has six kids by a Mexicanbandito or equivalent . All right , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of her and other members again since they are a part of me and I 've learned a tolerance unknown a couple of years ago but let this incident be stricken , I 've been given to understand it 's not to be spoken of . What am I doing here ? Aside from the practical thing of wanting to burn most of my possessions , there is the mixing of memory and desire of twenty years among burnt and green hills . Can you have patience with this sentimentalism ? This is anothercountry 3000 miles from not you but your world . It is n't the issue there are no issues , it 's simply something I must incorporate . It is n't either the thing women are accused of , turning to grass and leaves because they ca n't cope with all the other . 1 would have to have made this pilgrimage sometime , though that hardly consoles anyone at this moment . I wrote 3 letters to you before sleep would come and before it would leave but this is none of them . The air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear a dog bark blocks away . That and a plane droning away into thep183sun and stillness are the keys that touch off my life here past . Do I have a place at all ? Do you see what tortured thing happens  --  this evanescence next to thoughts of you ? You are very much of a presence surrounding me . Because I will return to you it is madnessto miss you but I do . Perhaps it will give you pleasure thereforeto know that I can not enjoy being here . But I confess I must try to force myself to it because I will regret all otherwise . I walked around the streets of Berkeley ; looked for few friends with little luck , but I will go again tomorrow or the next day . I tell you in all egoism do not be afraid of what I find . I realized several months ago that there are less than a handful of people who are a part of me and they all have wives or husbands which in itself perhaps means little except it cuts down communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as real as looking into a telephone receiver . And then there is Tim . I hope to god I 've made you understand and feel there is no need to worry about that . In suicidal moments in the past I contemplatedmaking that complete compromise , but I can not . It 's very easy for me to meet him now ; how very slowly it died for me . To him I 'm wilder than any 2 television serials , let him think so . 3 years ago I thought of murdering him , now I can simply say goodbye . You did not deserve the abruptness of my departure , the clan or no , and I 'm feeling all the pangs and pain of the wrong move . A reflex action , a bad habit I learned from associations past . Humility has been a long time coming . Finally . An admission . There is something I can be taught . Let 's say , chess . And no lit cigars in that drawer on the right . I kiss youand six or seven and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two during those twentyninedays , in a self-congratulatory mood , or periodic failed at/tempt to cut down on cigarettes , or brief suspension of the need to avoid the fat male trappings which pleasured my father , and I 'd promised to keep empty and hallowed her two dresser drawers ( both on the right ) while she was gone . All other referencesseem straightforward enough . I did n't admit to worryingabout Tim , or not aloud ; that paragraph seemed fuller than was necessary , creating what it talked away , laying the ghost it conjured . But what was more nervous-making still was how fine her letter was . She seemed to have sought and found the best in me to address it to ; to acknowledge and exorcise the worst of herself only in its presence . And one does not that often feel at one 's best , nor care to have it appealed to at unexpectedmoments . Also , it sounded much as if the lady , howeverself absorbed , was in love , which is always a cause for concern . I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought that if any was there it could be detected and noted by whoever believed she had caused it ) ; I was n't even sure which conversation she referred to : her call to me from the airport , or the one she made two days later , or whether she meant the telephone at all . She could have been alluding to my letter of the nineteenth , about being waspish , which she had by that time . By then I 'd written her again , mailing it on the twentythird , the same day she wrote to me . I enclosed the check for $150 which she had not asked for . It was a kick to be able to afford it . If I never heard from her again , if she took my money and disappeared into the emotional jungle , there was capital to be made of that as well . I knew the airfare was a little more than what I 'd sent . Given her bank balance , or my guess at it , raising the missing seven dollars would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you ambitious ? You might bring some paintings back , if so . New York , as they say , is the place where such things happen.  |p185The  porch , I think , as warm weather comes , might function nicely as a studio . Got my deposit back on that university charter . Did n't really want to go to Europe this summer , but was bamboozled by the bargain . Enclosed is carfare . Even at 6% , at $2 a day you 'll have it paid back in no time . Love , impatience , JasonThere ensued a silence . It was not for me to break it . I had clone what I could . My life reverted to my own . At worst , perhaps , with a clever accountant , I could write it off as a business loss . Then on Sunday , March 7 , she called . It was exactly noon her time , three P.M. mine . I was at my desk , alone . " Hello . " " Hello , puss . " " Is this a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a fantastic time to call . " She had little to say . She would be where I was Tuesday evening , two days thence . I expressed disappointment , not all feigned , that it would take her so long . I 'd allowed myself to think she was already in New York . She sounded so close in my ear . She got back at six on the evening of March 9 , as she had said she would . I 'd thought she meant the plane would land at six , but I was ready enough when the chimes sounded instead . I 'd spent the afternoon cleaning the apartment , all nooks and nannies , paying special attention to the condition of ashtrays , as my mother had before me . I 'd gone over the treacherous rug oil hands and knees , thick inch by inch , and found the leavingsI was looking for , enough to braid a small Chinaman , of all shades and lengths and textures , hairs once the property ofp186Leslie , Sarah , Jane , Sarkissian , Sams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small gold earring , which stirred no memories . The morning had gone to laying in supplies . I brought home thirty dollars ' worth of food from AkP , and licked the plaid stamps into place . I was saving toward a barbecuepit , two books and a half , for the balmy days ahead . BeveragesPaul and I took care of the night before . We made a wine run to East Harlem in his vintage pickup truck , bought a case of zinfandel apiece , and I a gallon of Spanish sauterne and a quart of retsina , in honor of her Greek affinities . Hard liquor I had , in long supply . He drove me home , carried in my case , and stayed long enough to sample the sauterne . It could n't have been more than twenty minutes . He was back in seconds , leaning on my bell , to announce that his own case of red had been swiped from the back of the truck . He was amused . " They glommed it , father . I wish I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very strong , very fast PR . " Still chuckling , he left again . It did n't occur to me until too late to give him a gallon of mine . So I was a self-sufficient unit next evening when the doorbellrang . I put down my scotch and water , reached for the buzzer , decided instead to walk down the hall and let her in . There might be a cab to pay , luggage to carry in . I opened the vestibule door . She had paid off the cab . There was one heavy suitcase , which I bent to , still looking into her face . Presently she said hello , her patented , microfilmed hello  --  you could mine it for weeks , but first and last it seemed to say , We 're beautiful . But she looked air-tired and drawn , and dowdy in her traveling clothes . The circles beneath were almost as black as her eyes . She seemed plump ; probably she was n't , but I 'd slimmed her in my mind . And I believe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look better after sleep and settling in , probably by the following morning ; if not . . . I turned over the martyrdom . Having come this far with her , plain or no I 'd love her anyway . Although , in the circuni/stances , who would blame me if on occasion I had eyes . . . all this the opening flash . Create the worst , then salvage . I turned with my burden and she followed me into the apartment . I dropped the suitcase in the back room and joined her in the main one . She was standing , fumbling with buttons , in the middle of the room . I came up behind , kissed her cheek , and helped her off with her coat . It was a thin cloth coat , not new . I ventured an anticlimactic " Welcome home . " I hung the coat in the closet , to the left , in the space I 'd once more cleared for her , and came and joined her on the couch . I rested an arm near her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exhausting . Dull . I was seated next to a New York clothingmanufacturer who would n't stop talking . " " What about ? " She shrugged . " Sex mostly , I suppose . I could n't always tell . " " How 's your sister ? " " She 's . . . all right . The crisis is over , for the moment . She seems to have made peace with her lot in life " Would you like a drink ? " " No . Yes , why not . " " Scotch ? Wine ? " " Scotch . " I made it fairly light . " Would you like to go to bed ? Are you as weary as you look ? " " Soon . . . Why did you write that you were n't going to Europe this summer ? " " Because I 'm not going to Europe this summer . " " Was it a sort of a bribe ? " " What do you mean ? " " What I said . " " How a bribe ? Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthwhile ? "  | " Yes . " " Sure . Why not ? " " It . . . was n't necessary . " " Good . But you need n't worry about it . I decided not to travel until I 'd finished my book . " " Oh . " " Have you eaten ? " " Yes , on the plane . " " You want to nibble on something ? Cheese ? I 've got four different kinds . The larder 's full . " " No , thank you . " A somnolent beginning . I poured myself another drink , placed it on the night table , and knelt before her . I put my arms in her lap , elbows on her knees . " Come on down , I want to talk to you . " She smiled slightly , leaned forward slightly , but her body remained as stiff as my wit . I dropped it , embarrassed and relieved . I was n't certain what I wanted . I was n't sure I cared for what I thought I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to wipe out whatever had gone in between . Given my temperament , and her predilections , I was fairly certain something had . I was n't wrong . A few nights later she volunteered ( or I extracted ) the information that her last two nights in Berkeley were spent holed up with Tim . She showed no contrition ; rather she made it seem that in the circumstancesit was the least she could do for the man . And anything but pleased , I had no real way to object , without invoking the fierce double standard of my fathers . Tim was her Tim  --  her most loyal , her most damaged  --  and this time she 'd really kissed him goodbye . Whereas I had dallied in the interim with trinkets , cutting notches on my pecker , nothing more . But now everything was over . ( Or would be in a day or two : I 'd been playing it safe , awaiting her return , still drafting the dear jane to Leslie in my head . ) Back bed and board with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning now . That night , March 9 , I had a dream . My journal , notebook , diary , whatever one can call that intermittent ragbag I have kept now for a dozen years , records it . I regarded my dreams in those days as being of two main kinds : so complex , sinuous and laden they invited analysis only by gypsies , or swift , clean and classical . This was of the second type . I lay naked beside a blooming , naked Christa , the same bed in which we slept . Also present , also nude , was Paul . He huddled near the wall , alone , ignored , unwelcome . In acknowledging this , and in moving to leave , he came up over Christa , who lay on her belly , and his shriveled member barely brushed her ass . It may have been an accident . And he immediately departed . But he 'd utterly spoiled her for me . He 'd won her away with that tactile magic , whether or not he so intended . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I scrawled on a card when I woke ; this was the one I remembered . And though I 've come to embracea different meaning since , at once more hopeful and snore deadly , I was pleased with the one I teased out then : that I was , beneath it all , so simple-minded ; that my unconscious could so neatly synthesize its terrors , throw them in my lap and leave the rest to me . I never did present this dream to Frank , though I had n't planned to suppress it . But what could he have added  --  a Sophoclean label ? Those were my fears , baldly stated in this message from the night . I had all day free to allay them . As early as the next morning she began talking of a job . She seemed in earnest . She had checked out leads while still in Berkeley and come up with a lab in Long Island , Brookhaven , which she thought might hire her , the sole difficulty being that she was willing to work only part time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have asked her this by then a half a dozen times , and she told me every time , in greater detail and withP190diminishing cordiality , but I asked her again , and she told me again , mentioning the previous occasions and no longer concealingher impatience . And I 'm damned if I could have paraphrasedit twenty minutes later . I tune out perhaps a third of what anyone tells me about anything , which is awkward only if and as I suddenly become engaged , and demand filling in on what was said five minutes before ; and this is doubly true of subjects however vaguely scientific or mechanical . Which Christa 's avocation was . Such self-loving mea culpas aside , I can reconstruct enough , for present purposes  --  her marketableskills related to computers , feeding in the coded data , presiding over blinking lights . In Berkeley she had specializedin the wee hours , in what she called the " owl shift , " or else part time by day , leaving most of her time free to pursue her art , or whatever it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , about her Brookhaven scheme . ( Certainly it seemed too dutiful , came too quickly off the mark . ) There was hardly any doubt that we would both be better off if one or the other was out of the house a good deal of the time , preferably her , since I had a nice arrangement where I was : the huge formica desk bought second-hand about a year earlier from Gardella , set up in a workroom as richly cloistered as the inside of my head , its one barred window looking out on nothing , onto a corner of the porch ; yet I had been considering renting an office or a room nearby and turning the hearth over to her . I could easily afford it . It might be useful to attempt to shit and eat in differentquarters ; new energies might flow from such division of living and labor . On the other hand , perhaps it would be wiser to find her a studio , a place of her own with painterly light , and sit tight where I was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint ? Had she the talent , and the zitzfleish , and the drive ? The saving truth is that I did n't really care . She could be artist , hausfrau , or such combination as she pleased . Shc could stroll the byways of Fun City during the daylight hours ;  |p191that  would solve the privacy problem , or mine . Either way , I knew , I would have to concoct a schedule independent of her movements , learn to work while she was home or away . I had a chat with Sarah , and she agreed to let me use her apartment to type in , if I wished , any weekday , nine to five . This was a few days before Sarkissian returned and brought things so quickly to a head by her talk of employment . In sum , I was not keen . Strolling the wilds of Gotham was dangerous enough ; a job would be a separate world she would inhabit , daily rubbing shoulders with unkempt strangers , and was n't that , if my selectivememory served , how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I could n't frame it to her quite that way , it was n't rational . " You 're sure you want a job ? " " Yes . I 've . . . some money in the bank , but not terribly much . " " Christa , I 'm lousy with it . I just signed this fat contract . " " I know . That 's lucky for you . But I 'll need some on my own . " " Oh . How about looking into a teaching job ? You 've got the credentials , and the pay and the hours would be better . Teaching art , maybe , in some private school . " " No . I 'm not able to do that . I could n't teach art . " She was very final . " Oh . Well , take a week off , relax , you just got here . Long Island 's a pain in the ass to get to anyway , without a car . " Wary , private as she was , I thought I understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would too readily confuse us . I 'd been there myself , I decided , as recently as ' 62 , the postEuropedays . Working part time in GPO . Now there was a sterile , untaxing way to make a buck . It seemed urgent for a certain type , at a certain stage in life , to keep his vision separatefrom his livelihood . Teaching in or near one 's specialty , or what one hoped one 's specialty would one day be , was es/pecially to be avoided . In the first place , one would probably be incompetent , mind too pedestrian or messy to make sense of histories and trends ; in the second , Shavian saws or warningson doing and teaching did apply . My own stint had come about the one way it could have  --  I was approached , after my book came out , to teach a writing course . Alma mater beckoned , albeit to one of its lesser divisions , and I heeded the call . Having come so late to the trappings of the writer 's life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fringe benefits where I could . But it had to happen as it happened , backing in . Some of us must make our mark , or begin to , before we can ( however modestly ) instruct . And so she did n't want to teach . HOWEVER ( interjected Uncle Jason , finger wagging , rich with junkyard wisdoms ) , with her MFA , her intelligence , skills , presentability . . . a few hours a day in a finishing school , giving the pre-debs a feeling for the craft : a little art history , some basic drawing , a shmeck of culture ; she 'd probably be good at it , likely enjoy it , and it would be a more useful and lucrative pastime than messing around with punched cards . But she had to get there by herself . She had to live it through . At the moment she inhabited the place where the kind of work she did had not merely to be separate from her image of herself but in some manner beneath it , even demeaning , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to be there . You traded them some time , they let you live . Deep in the bowels of the post office ( true boon to the dregs ) , mindlessly boxing mail . Home of cripples , androgynes , and artists-in-their-heart . You ought to wonder sometime how your mail ever moves , with the cretins they employ . No doors in the shithouse ( and rumors , on the job , of cameras overhead ) so some poor hunchback should n't jesse james the mails . I threw it up in early ' 63 , along with my burglarized sublet , and lit out for Arizona , where , as I have n't tired of say ing , I got lucky . A book , a Guggenheim . The teaching offer not long after . P193Christa , I may have been saying , wo n't you let me be your Guggenheim ? Spare you bitter , clerking labors which serve no proper end ? Ca n't you find the ease , the grace , the mere selfinterestto accept ? I may have been saying this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of my wish . She took that first week off , and then she took another , and I do not think a job was mentioned again until Jane Mason called about an opening in her art gallery , in the far from merry , too-late month of May . Her second or third week back she came up one night to sit in on my class . The suggestion had been mine . She still had no friends in New York , or none I cared to contemplate , but apart from this urge to fill in and supervise her idle hours , I wanted her there to see me work , see Jason work , bestow encomiums , level accusations , consider me credentialized , considerme fraudulent , share the unique experience of J. Sams of all the costive people exhorting others to get off the pot , and by the end of it to judge me as I judged myself , harshly and kindly . We were not able to travel to the U together . I went to see Frank late that afternoon , in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scheduled session , but he had taken to using me as his utility man , phoning and trying to fit me in when someone canceled out , to plug and tidy up his working day . Rather than resent it , then , I tried to see it as a tribute to my flexibility and leisure . Considering how little and how ir-i cgularly I worked , how I was always teetering on the verge , it would have been mere bitchery to say no . And it would have risked tampering with his affection . ( I assumed , after close to three years , that he looked upon me kindly . It was hard to see how else he could have borne it . That he felt or expressed nothing stronger than affection suited me as well . It might even  --  I gave him all the credit due him , perhaps a little more  --  have been part of the Treatment . I was n't quite ready Ior love , or not in that context , and if I knew it , surely he knewp194it too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have minded regular hours , rigid , predictable times , like any run-of-the-mill nineto-fiveneurotic , but since this was not in the cards I strove to make a virtue of uncertainty , to feel one-up and close to cured if he could come to me for a favor . Some days I was less successfulthan on others  --  days on which I felt much more a petitionerthan a colleague . Anyway , around two , I gave Christa overexplicit instructions on how to reach the university , together with a campus map , and departed . I had precious little to tell the gray man that afternoon . I remembered no dreams . My real life with my real girl , unlike the ten-year parade of sick dalliance preceding , which we 'd explored to its depths , was in a real way none of his business , which made large inroadsin the things we had to talk about . Nor did I care to dwell for very much longer on how difficult it still remained to write fiction for the ages ; I had been sounding that haughty , whining note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvedor altered in that time . I was beginning to think , I blurted , that there might not be that much left that he could do for me . There was a silence . Lying down , this time , I craned back for a look . He was writing . He looked up . He seemed unperturbed . Um , well , yes , he agreed we had reached a plateau . For his part he was content to wait it out , doodle away a fifty-minute hour or two , gird for the next upward climb . Could we speed things up ? I asked him . I was financiallyequipped to come three times a week . I was even eager . In his opinion it would n't help . The material had its own rhythm , emerged in its own sweet time . For me , twice a week was enough . Disappointed , I calculated how much money I would save over a year , and made my peace . ( Later I would learn from either Dino or Bob Kane that Covington once confessedhe saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all he felt he could stand , or handle . ) That day I leapt from the couch and fled the office gladly , trying to metamorphose as 1p195went , analysand to pedagogue , one madcap role to another . I caught the Forty-ninth Street crosstown bus on Lexington Avenue and inched toward the Seventh Avenue subway , past the Waldorf-Astoria , the unlikely supermarket on the corner of Park , past Rockefeller Plaza , the jerk-off cinema between Sixth Avenue and Broadway ( a block I would get to know a lot better later on ) , dined on good greasy hamburgers in some stand-up Broadway joint , chased by the cardboard coffee a New Yorker or a ball fan comes to love , and descended into the rush hour . I found a seat and I looked through an ms. or two on the way up , things I would be reading to the class that evening , and took renewed pleasure in my own red-inked cominents , not all of which I remembered delivering ; all were terse , sometimes harsh , more often gentle . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my semi-private cubicle on the second floor , nodding to the departmental secretary on the way by , the new hat was fairly well in place . I had been teaching this , " Beginning Fiction , " for close to two years . The classes met one night a week . They contained from six to fifteen souls , of all sexes and ages and degrees of mastery of the language , of varying motives and schooling and ambition . I was the sole arbiter of who was qualified to take the course , and I barred no one . Almost always there were two or three sufficiently vocal or productive to get us through the time , and usually there was one , at least , who wrote well enough to keep me interested . But I tried to shortchange no one , in class or in the conference hour . I labored as mightily with the poor spellers and those innocent of grammar as with the burgeoning talents  --  tutor in grade-school English one moment , Max Perkins the next , and getting my kicks in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover and guide . Anyone with a story to tell and some glimmering of how to tell it was able to engage me . I have a letter of thanks from a sixty-year-old woman who dealt in Florida real estate ,  |p196with  whose gelid but single-minded prose I took some pains , and there 's many a fine young laddie down the years ( to count them also since ) who 's sprouted fuzz on his face from one week to the next in gratitude and emulation ; but I was waiting for a darkling virgin-whore , with long black silken hair and finebonedface and a surgeon 's nasty talent , who told it from her own deep , liquid places like it was ; I 'd give her a quick A+ and bundle her home and plant her at my desk and be quite stern about her working hours ; and playing hours ; I 'd badger and coddle her muscular muse ; I 'd be the bloody thing . Nothingalong these lines ever turned up , though there were damselswho were pretty , others who could write , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one ambitious screwed-up twat from Scarsdale , whose prose was bitchylyrical , who boasted of daddy 's wealth and could outdrink me , who never wore underpants and was accident-prone , I allowed to have her way with me for a couple of rueful weeks near one semester 's end . ( She pulled a B  --  , like the rest . ) I mean by the above no more than that I took these classes seriously , which may have made me unique in the department . I granted each and every student , from the opening bell and throughout the term , a succession of private audiences . These were listed in the catalogue as " conferences , " and were technicallypart of the course , but most of my confreres cut them down or out at the earliest pretext , which saved them the preclasshour . Not me . I enjoyed lolling in that three-sided box , at that oversize desk , bright , inlaid light blasting from the cork ceiling , my name typed neatly on an index card amidst others more illustrious ( we shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine academics , hogtied by tenure , from the cubiclesaround me , exchanging occasional pleasantries with the tiny brown woman in the office behind who taught Swahili , savoring the junk academic mail ( sometimes addressed , which raised some discomfort , to " Professor " Sams ) , but all of thisp197consumed a quarter-hour or so , and then I wanted company . So I would schedule meetings with my students whether or not they wished them , whether or not they had produced anything about which they cared to confer . I do n't think they minded . Hell , I was credentializing them , as well as myself . And some of my motives were less questionable than the rest : I wanted them laboring , and I wanted to know who they were . I was being paid a certain amount , around thirty dollars an hour , to tell them something , they were being charged an exorbitanttuition to find out what it was , and I meant to impart it . Elusive as it was , it required a certain number of face-to-face confrontations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of these meetings I learned to understand a little better how a man could turn to lay analysis as a profession , if he was not too messed up in his own heart of hearts and lacked all other talents . Within the given range , I was not equipped too badly . For one thing , I knew first-hand how naked and spread-eagled the ego can feel when it lays itselfout on the page . I 'd taken such courses as an undergrad myself , had been intelligently handled , and tried to pass on what I 'd learned . Let me apologize forthwith to my co-workers of the time who were at least as noble as I. As for the rest . . they knew that " teaching writing " was a con game , and that the chief pedagogical challenge was to keep this knowledge from the marks . Prime example was Mr. Blank , who headed up the show but still had to teach a class or two himself . A nondescriptand ageless horn-rimmed little man from Oregon . He had a thousand ways to get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was delighted to share them . You had them grind out an autobiographical fragment . You assigned them a charactersketch . You asked them for a snatch or two of dialogue . Are they totally uninspired , duller than dull ? Bring in a lively clipping from the public prints on which they can embroider . If really uptight  --  you have some writer friends ?  --  bail outp198with a guest lecture . He would fairly chortle as he passed on this wisdom . All of it predicated on the student 's being a shmuck , if only for enrolling in such an obvious hype in the first place . And yet the man had got to where he was , occupied his safe , officious niche . . . perhaps he had an abundance of administrative skills . He frightened me to death . He had published a work of fiction twenty years before , held a B.A. in Englishfrom his native state . There before my eyes was the fate of the one-book man with no advanced degrees , clinging to the outskirts of Academe ( and livelihood ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory , not even toting the yellowingreviews , but all his energies devoted now to fending off the moment when some wise-ass would rise slowly from his place at the seminar table , on the heels of some hoary , rote pronunciamento ( " The thing you have to remember is , write about what you know . " " The trouble is , your dialogue has no life " ) , and drawl , " But Mr. Blank , with all due respect , just what the fuck have you written lately ? "  --  but this may not have been his problem , or not any longer , as it had not yet come to be mine . And all being said , the man had in him something sensitive , to pain , if not to wit , or maybe both . . . but to hell with that . Let him mouth his own praises . I just recently discovered that the son of a bitch had always underpaidme . Crying poor-mouth , budgets beyond his control , hostile trustees , but other writers of no greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I. I suspected it even then , while I still held the job , but did n't want to check it out , risk the choler I knew I would feel and so jeopardize the fringe benefits , intangible and other . And there were others : cheap summer charter flights to foreign places , including the pre-Christa one I signed up for , in December of ' 64 , loving the bargain , but canceled gladly when the chance arose ; the magnificentlibrary facilities I so rarely used ; discounts in the bookstores ; signing regally for drinks at the faculty club ; butp199most important probably the image of myself , as I moved salariedand purposeful one night a week across the face of alma mater , the landscaped , improved , but still terribly familiar campus , with power , a role , an office hour . How different from the jangled ex-GI with mother 's money in his pocket ( " Professor " Sams ! ) , up there to fulfill her destiny ; so wonderfullyremote from the pimpled loner , unloved undergrad , eyeing with hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not one of whom in four long years he ever met , and who had not changed that much in the fifteen years since , or only in their morals  --  their young , emancipated pussies winked and nodded as I passed benignly by , almost smiling through my beard , writer , mentor , possible lover  --  these were the very good moments . At times , especially in colder weather , I would have to induce them , say a beer or three , or something more , to ward off a deeper vision , of how little I had really altered since the beanie days , of how many more or less sophisticated ways remained until the grave of playing pocket pool . Some weak-chinned , pockmarked , foureyed , unformed , undergraduate face might set it off , some **26;10901;TOOLONG , some spectral sibling , or maybe just a poor day at the machine , or never getting there at all ; and now I was supposed to comment wisely on the work of my charges , or worse yet , try to extract it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strife , examinations , or the brain-breaking loneliness of the work itself , point up the need for habit , the importance of sitting one 's ass at regular intervals before the blank sheet of paper . . . what kind of specialized fraud was I about to become ? A boilermaker might do some good on an evening such as that . And if they smelled it on my breath , well , that could be twisted too , should any have the effrontery to call me on it . Brendan Behan . Dylan Thomas . Lowry . F. Scott . Papa himself . All reasonably prolific , brilliantly dead , all noted for the sauce . So long as I re/mained coherent , made the occasional coruscating , helpful judgment , none had reason to complain . Nor did anyone , so far as I know . I had two people due in that night , but neither showed . Zabb , a Jewish schoolteacher from Queens who wrote of how it felt to be a poor southern Negro in the forties , a reasonablyskillful ( if hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his wife was ill and he could not make the class ; and Delgado , who did come to class , explained that he had been too busy writing his new piece to want to come in and talk about the last . On this night I did n't mind the solitude . Leaning back , hands behind my head , I sat pondering my book  --  there was , indeed , a book ; I 'd enlarged it by a page or so that morning ; the thing was sneaking toward completion , phrase by phrase , despite my tears , my spastic efforts to oppose it  --  and recalling things about my lady . Of how she might come in from her wanderings late of an afternoon , and if the mood was on me I would ask her , " Any adventures ? " not really needing to know , and if the mood was on her she would say Why , yes . . . as she was climbing the crud and debris down by Twentieth Street and the East River , making that nearby stench-pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in passing , the crew waved and cheered , the boat bellowed again , she finally acknowledged , and she flushed again , relating it , as she must have at the time , enjoying this present moment , eked out by shrugs and smiles , almost as much as the first , and I struggled to savor it with her , for what sane man is threatened by a tugboat , that many yards from the shore ? Yet bugged that all the " adventures " she chose to describewere of this nature ( but had I truly meant some other kind ? ) , and soothed on top of that , that if she needed this sort of thing , at least she brought the stories home , laid the world 's sexual applause at Poppa 's feet , who alone of its vast population , he more or less believed , had real access to the wares.  |p201Sometimes  she would say nothing about where she had been or what she had done , and that was her privilege , too . Just as it was mine at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious to begin with , her silence made me so  --  to be miffed by her evasive wa , s . At twenty minutes past six I began the slow walk to the classroom , on the other end of campus . It was moving toward dusk and the subway heaved out a new academic shift , mostly adults , the " night folk , " as we tended to dismiss them in my snotnosed salad days . A group of college men , great-thighed in shorts , jogged on past , so much athletic meat , giving off their jockstrap aroma even in the open air . Good luck to them , I gave them room . Watching the gladiators on the tube was one thing , imbibing them another . For a while I had a secondstringback in my class , a good-natured Pole who turned in one piece early on , a spare account of the pre-game lockerroomatmosphere , tapings , tensions , friendships strained , which accomplished all that he intended . For Wdowka , too , I had ambitions . I would bring him on slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , so far as I knew , who could carry John R. Tunis 's glove . ( But a week or so later , pleading academic and gridiron pressures , he dropped the course . ) He was one of three people in the room when I arrived . Mrs. Baldakian and Mrs. Hale were the others . Mrs. Hale was my writer ; I would be a bit surprised if she has not , by now , achieved some public success . I 'd already asked her what the devil she was doing there , in my class or any other , and she replied that she still needed the incentive and the praise . She was in her mid-twenties , thin and tall , a sort of desiccated Jane Mason , drier skin , stringier hair . Once , after class , I let her buy me a couple of beers in the local and afterwards I walked her home , as I understood it  --  she led me down a side street to the parapet overlooking the Hudson River , pleasant and deserted , where the warm breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ah , well . How many can you trust ? She had a huge respect for published writers , of which I did not attempt to disabuse her , but explainedmy domestic situation , gave her a brotherly kiss , and she walked me back to the subway . Her fiction dealt with things like unconsummated dykey affairs and France , and becauseof the latter preoccupation I slipped up frequently on place-names , but made even more egregious blunders , for she also used English words , always correctly , which I had never seen before . I offered to let her read her own work , but she said she preferred things as they were . Not that she was shy , especially , she simply liked to listen . A few more arrived , seven of a possible ten , and just before the last , the slightly tardy Delgado , came Christa . She 'd put her hair up since I saw her last . She wore her black coat , her patched-up boots . She had to pass me on the way in , my perch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlip in greeting . She paused an instant ; I gestured self-consciously toward the several empty chairs , some close at hand . But she took one to the rear , set back a bit from the table . Establishing her distance . Very well . I did n't trouble to inform the class there was a guest in their midst ; I doubted she would appreciate it , and they could see it well enough . After some opening patter I set up conferences for the following week , and collected what work they had done between the previous week and this . I alerted them to a book review I 'd done , due out the following Sunday . This was hardly the place for false modesty . I turned over the floor for a moment . A girl just out of college was having her problems with " structure " . . . looking wise , I let there kick it around amongst themselves . It was n't my long suit . Between them , my intellectual and my athlete sorted her out . We were ready to begin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so had several others . The atmosphere was relaxed . I was feeling fairly goodp203in any case , sober as a judge and filled with a sense of all our possibilities , but I 'd come in with only two things worth readingaloud over the two hours , works by Baldakian and Hale , neither awfully long , which could have left us with a sticky swath of time to fill , but Delgado bailed me out , as ( if he showed up ) I had known he would , with another of his chaotic longhand installments , which he had finished , he said , explaining his lateness , about thirty seconds before , in the john , the subway , a phone booth , I forget . I believed the dark young handsome skinny bastard when he said he did his writing everywhere , and he was equally credible when he said he had never rewritten anything in his life . He was not against rewrite , he agreed in our meetings that his work would probably profit from it , but the new material came gushing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and getting jobs , and losing jobs , and getting laid , and not getting laid , and fighting off queers , and using queers , and getting it all down while it was fresh , that he had trouble enough keeping pace as it was . He was about twenty-one , Brooklyn-born , half-Portuguese . Apart from this , I learned almost nothing about his past ; his life beganthe day he enrolled in my course . What he was attempting was nothing less than getting it all down , the ultimate diary , the **25;10929;TOOLONG , and damned if he was n't bringingit off to an impressive degree . Of course , some process of selection was at work : a sensibility , a sense of order always threatened to emerge , but it had n't yet , and I was n't sure I cared to midwife it even if I had been able , for then he would become a writer , then he would produce literature , and I could n't calculate how much this might cost him . The first thing he ever handed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aloud , dissembling my own shock as I went , and three ladies of a certain age therewith dropped the course . Which was surely just as well . Almost a year later , in February of ' 66 , I received a letter from Los Angeles , where he had gone to seek his for-P204tune . In moving from one coast to the other he had lost all his manuscripts , and needing them now for one reason or another he wondered if I had had the foresight and the interest , given their obvious merit and high level of lubricity , to have them xeroxed while they were in my possession , in which case he would be glad if I sent them along . He seemed fairly certain that I 'd had it done . An almost perfect arrogance . But he was right , he was the dirtiest writer I have ever read . I wish I had reproduced that endless copybook scrawl , I would certainly share it with you . Reading him , that night , I was as embarrassedas I had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slurring the " cocksuckers " and the " cuntlappers " and the " prick testing the hairy asshole " ( male/male , this was ) , or less embarrassed than fearful , that hearing me read the drivel she would associate me with it in her mind , or not that either but fearful , yes , that exposing her to so blatant an account and not shooting it down in the discussion which followed ( or even if I had ) would tend to condone or make seem respectable her own near-obsessional ( if less graphic ) concern with sexuality . I followed up with Mrs. Hale , a drastic change of pace , though I was not too much more comfortable reading the one than the other . And finished with Mrs. Baldakian , a sweet-faced Jewish woman in her forties married to an Armenian , whose fiction for a long while turned ( as it did that night ) entirely on retardation , the condition afflicting her youngest child . It did not seem the most promising subject matter , yet she managed to infuse it with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality stemmed more from our awareness of her closeness to the subject than from the work itself . She was another of those who put a large trust in life  --  if I suggested that some incident or phrase had not come off , taxed our sense of pace or credibility , she would say , less carping than bewildered , " But , Mr. Sams , it really happened that way , " and I could never do more than rejoin lamely that this was n't alwaysp205enough . Eventually I persuaded her to have a go at something different , someone else 's tragedy ; a kind , cooperative lady , she produced a long story of abortion , desertion and cancer among Irish Catholics , possibly plucked from the One HundredNeediest Cases , not badly done , an improvement on her earlier efforts , but by that time , mid-May , I was having troublemaintaining real interest in the job . So we got through the time . An average night . Eight cigarettessmoked . Mrs. Hale waylaid me on some allegedly literarymatter before I could escape ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I waited a moment after Mrs. Hale left , assembledmy papers , and took the elevator down . She was turning the leaves of the mobile bulletin board : concerts , tutors , dramaticproductions , cars for sale , charter flights , shared auto rides to distant places . " Sarkissian . Want to get a beer ? " " Do you ? " " You bet . " I took her arm , we walked into the evening . " Your football player was very chatty on the way down . " " What about ? " " What I was doing there , who I was . . . " ( He tried to pick her up , that blundering Neanderthal ? ) " Normal , healthy young man 's interest . " " Yes . " " What did you make of Delgado ? " " Which one was that ? " " The dirty one . " " Oh . Young , kind of feisty . . " What 's that mean ? " " Feisty ? Like a little dog , snapping at your heels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it but I never knew what it meant . Well , this is it , the face of a great university . How does it stack up to Berkeley ? "  |p206She  shrugged . " Less pretty . Much too citified . " " We had a tree once , but it died . " I waited , dry-mouthed , looking forward to the beer , hoping she would volunteer some comment on my overall performance , flattering or otherwise , but not terribly surprised when she did not . In the crowded , noisy bar , surrounded by the young , loosened by the first few slugs , I took over both our roles , deprecating the teaching post , or myself in it , then defendingthe action as a harmless holding of the line . The thing I had to do was finish Gino Travels , then wait ; they would come flooding in , the offers and sinecures , writer-inresidencehere , teach one course a week for fifteen thousand there , from all over the vast , culture-hungry reaches of the nation , Arizona , Iowa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't that be nice ? I would n't mind a year or so in the Bay Area , I told her , on a fat salary and with a sexy native guide . . . and on along these lines , then the one beer too many ( the still nursed her first ) , and we taxied home , alreadyspending my future , but what the hell , I was not destitute now , and the basket was firmly on my head , I was pointed squarely toward the market . A week later I took Christa to a Passover seder for a nest of reasons : because I wanted after all these years to go to one myself , or I wanted to shock the tribe , or test yet again which of them ( along these lines ) were shockable ( and was n't this the holiday , the night , to throw wide the gate to strangers ? ) ; because I wanted to announce to the mishpachah her real presence in my life , because I wanted , god help me , to broaden her anthropologically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own to learn the quaint customs of my people , went to the library and came back with the dreck you might expect , but read it through , and soon enough I was obliged to own top207ignorance , not without some pleasure , when she asked me to expand on the meaning of this ritual , this symbolic piece of food or that . Martha and Harry picked us up . Off we went to the Bronx , to the home of Aunt Beth , the issue of my mother 's primal scene , which she confessed to me when I was living with her and Harry post-robberies in ' 62 , tired perhaps of the analytic questions I sprang at every turn ( I had recently , secretly , begun ) , while I struggled to be casual how long or whether she had nursed me , did I wet the bed , had she ever caught me jerking off , etc.  --  how at a fairly tender age she was sleeping in her parents ' bedroom but awoke when her father stirred in the night , said ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby for Pesach , " and lo , it was Beth , on schedule , who would grow up to be my full-time babysitter , and go on from there to have a life of her own which is better left undescribed . I could never look at her childlike face ( even now , in her fifties , not so changed by time and suffering ) without pure pleasure , the source of which I could n't trace , unless it was the time she and a covey of girl friends put my Doctor Dentons on me back to front , or hands where feet should be , but could such an uproariousevent determine my feelings for the next thirty years ? I never , to my credit , gave it that much thought , hugged her roughly when I saw her , which was not more than once a year . It was to Beth 's that Molly went to live after my grandfather died , although not so quickly as she should have , putting in a number of bad years living alone in an apartment down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother in no small way . ( I was blessedly abroad through most of that time ; when I was n't , I would sit with her over coffee and strudel in her kitchen , and in her mockey 's English she would tell me many things , of meetings and partings in Galicia , reunions in London , separations , reunions in New York , making love  --  she blushed  --  to her husband-to-be in the back of a grocery store , of the hotdog wagon he pushed for a living before he gotp208the horse and then the truck and established the beer and seltzerroute through the Lower East Side which much later , like a medical practice , he sold , tales of dead-of-night journeys to outdoor toilets on Columbia and Cherry streets ( ( even the streets existed no longer ) ) , of how nervous a child was my mother , and of the first time she , Molly , had ever seen a bear . It was in 1906 , at the London zoo ( ( we had it in common ) ) . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beth barely married , in the twilight of her marriageable years , was a plumber , with even graver shortcomings , but he was an Orthodox Jew , the home was kosher , there were kids around , fussing to do , particularly for the sabbath and the high holy days , and in her final years the old woman was content . Yet it was bloody that night . I might not even have noticed , or minded , had I not had my gadfly with me , for this night was not that different from many other nights when the clan had gathered ; but as it was I saw things through her eyes . Sons and son-in-law were uniformly haunted all these years later by the absent patriarch , whose shoes the head of the house , Orthodox or not , was least able to fill , so they split up the headship in deadly democratic fashion , each read a part , murdering awe and even ceremony , and as for joy , a chance of that , there was the shrill and almost vicious bickering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father cross court with Irv ; and Beth 's teen-agers came and left with intrigues and crises of ' their own . . . yet through it all Molly served and beamed . I doubt the climate altogether escaped her , but she remained glad to have us all assembled , and very pleased at having lived this long . About halfway through she came up behind our chairs , me whom she had not seen for a year at least and Christa never ( and concerning Christa , I have to think she knew the worst , for milady looked like what she was , or Italian at best , and the question had been briefly , lightly raised iii Molly 's hearing by a youngish aunt-and-uncle team I had un/til that second regarded more highly ) , and she embraced us both at once , leaning over our backs , wrinkled and round , smelling of the kitchen , het gray hair neatly bunned , embracedus both at once but planted separate kisses on our cheeks , complained of how rarely she saw me , wondered how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest , her best  --  without presenting her with great-grandchildren ( though fortunately for us all , others , like my absent sister , then off in Sweden , had taken up the slack ) ? And as I laughed it off and reached back to clasp her rough , horny hand , I saw the other squeezing Christa 's shoulder . . . was it possible she could have missed it ? Or was it rather that , in keeping with the times , when it came time to shape and record , she remembered only chaos ? Freedom of action , as it was , presented itself quite often via the phone . It rang one open-ended evening , late in March , as I contemplated picking up the laundry . There was dead air at first , then a timorous female voice which mentioned , after some meandering , the name of a novelist I barely knew , from overlapping sojourns at an artists ' colony the autumn before . She fell , after that , into fumbling and silence . I invited her by , since the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she demurred . Sarkissian was at home , which informationmight have put her at ease , but I saw no way to impart it . I offered to meet her outside the Manufacturers ' Hanover Trust on j'ourteenth Street in ten minutes and take her with me on my homely errand , and to this she agreed . " Did you hear that ? " I said to Christa . " No . I was n't listening . Who was it ? " " Damned if I know . Some waif in distress . I 'm going to take her with me to the laundry . Be back in a little while . " We approached the bank from opposite directions . I expectednothing , or perhaps the worst , partly thanks to Dino'sp210ancient tale , With a Rose in Her Hair , one of a batch of shorter works he 'd shown to me in Barcelona . It featured a stout , ageing woman with a shriveled leg ( and a rose in her hair ) whom the hero , by an outraged , callous ruse , successfully evaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hour , at precisely that spot , beneath the Bronx elevated line . It had stayed in my mind as the perfect paradigm for blind dates of any kind , however undistinguished , as a story , in most other respects . So I was perfectly prepared to let the smallish , shapely , long-tressed girl approaching across Second Avenue pass me at whatever she considered the proper speed and distance , contenting myself with the mandatory glance at her rear . Instead she walked directly up in a way which belied her telephone manner , and asked if I was Jason Sams . I thought , It ca n't be , I 've seen the movie , but I nodded gravely and escortedher down Fourteenth to First Avenue , where , as I 'd promised , we picked up my laundry . She was an altogether lovely brown-eyed snub-nosed Baptist doll , with blonde hair so fine it might have dissolved at the touch . Not only that . . . at the corner tavern , into which ( laundry bag and all ) I steered her , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American literature at one of the city colleges , and would have finished her doctoral thesis on The Confidence Man long before now had the affair of the heart with my colleaguenot intruded . I gulped my third beer somewhat ruefully . Naturally such a prize would come into my life only when I was elsewhere committed , playing house with another . But this was fate , and I was not really at that moment discontentedwith my private life . It had its definite rewards , it made no large demands . I spoke at length of Christa , gave her a fairly good press , and I could see this stray , beleaguered beauty envy us our bliss . Well , there was always room for friendship , and the wheel of life kept turning  --  what did she want , why had she called ? On certain nights , when she neededp211her man , and he had to be elsewhere , she became so desperate and glum that she tried to connect with people he knew , or had merely mentioned . ( I was close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach nearly every name he 'd ever dropped , or every male ; by her account , to my surprise , not all had been hospitable . ) The writer , her lover , a  --  I recalled him  --  defensive , wisecracking Jewish New Yorker of a derivativeand very middling talent , a year or two younger than myself , was married , with three children , and was not then able or willing to divorce his wife . He had arranged for Glory to visit a psychiatrist , his very own , and this , she said , was no small boon , but her loneliness , at times , still brought her to this present pass . And she was glad , tonight , it had  --  she found me gentle and sympatico , not sullen and surly at all ( well , up yours , too , Henry ! ) , as she confessed he had describedme . I envied him of course , whatever his griefs and anxieties : another of the hard-nosed males who managed to have it both ways . I wished for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that connection or some other ) a child or two , had put such seminal , grown-up deeds behind me . Or was it the having been married , that especial contemporarypurple heart , I craved . Even Glory Green , young and fragile as she seemed , owned to an ex-husband , a dissolved fiveyearmarriage . Only Sarkissian and myself , it appeared , were thus far unscathed . We 'd been in that beer-stinking joint for close to an hour . For reasons as tangled as her own must have been in phoning up , I asked Glory to come back with me . She was not , to tell the truth , especially keen , she thanked me for my time and kindness up to there , but I insisted . I said she would be doing us a favor : Christa had no female friends in New York and the two of them would probably hit it off . Reluctantstill , she agreed to stop by for a while . I shouldered my bag and led her up the street , a narcissistic Santa Claus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But producing herP212this way would set off many things . Her sheer attractiveness would make clear to Christa why my absence was extended . But bringing the goods to the hearth would show milady how little she had to fear , should she behave herself , concerning my fidelity ; should she screw around , how much . And Glory Green  --  the wheel of life kept turning  --  would have viewed , all innocent , the inside of my lair , my paintings , my ( still living ) pussycat ; some magic has already occurred , whatever comes of it , as soon as they set foot inside the door . All this and more was clear and conscious in my mind , blithe butterfly motivesskittering through the underbrush . The whole ecologicalmess  --  butterflies , underbrush  --  culminated in the simpleact ; and the simple act bespoke a style , a sense of situation , which , god willing , has been honed a little since . Nothing  --  should the above lines seem to offer promise  --  out of the ordinary or interesting occurred . Christa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Glory was on the couch . Himself , social director , sat in the black basket chair , equidistant between them . Glory crossed her legs . Christa , in Japanese sandals and a peasant skirt , hair down , leaned forward . My eyes , my best attention , went from the one to the other . I brought out the scotch , wound up drinking it myself . Indeed , they seemed to hit it off . They had in common , discussed at length , La Jolla , California , I forget just why . My sharp-nosed , large-legged , shrugging lady , whose moles and smells I knew , came off less well , I thought , in conversationaland esthetic terms . After a sip or two , I resolved not to judge the entries but to try and dig the show in its entirety , count my blessings , and I indulged a reverie , while they did their California thing , on types like this one , my inexpli cable weakness through the years for such as Glory Green , and how little gaiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought me . Her legs were ( their legs were always ) shapely , the calf of one , the way she had them now , made broad and bulbous by thep213knee of the other , that sweet blush , when she uncrossed them , formed under the knee . When they ran down on La Jolla , I filled the gap myself , talking books , Henry 's , Melville 's , mine , Christa 's reading list ( Siddartha at the time ) , then Glory said she had to go . I offered to take her home , for a hundred reasons . About a week before , returning with a purchase from the liquor store , and not so sober when I went , I ran into a motorcycleclub coming up the block as I was starting down . They were on foot , on my side of the street . The street , at ten P.M. , was otherwise empty . They did not usually stray this far north , this side of Fourteenth Street , but there they were , swaggering in black jackets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated that if I continued at my present pace I would run into them right outside my door . High as I was , I felt safe ( which was not the same as feeling brave ) ; otherwise , chances were , I would have changed direction on the spot , moved back toward lights , the liquor store , or the adjacent supermarket ( open until midnight ) , much less ashamed of myself than on those times I 've given ground in broad daylight to untended ( logs of all sizes , glimpsed from a distance . My beard , my unconcern , their innate humanity  --  something was going to protect me . All the same , I reached into my pocket and lingered my keys , notions of flight mingled with thoughts of defense . A man on a Spanish boat , using keys , had split open my jaw  --  five stitches from a government doctor when we reached Alicante . The group and I collided , as I 'd measured , just outside the house . I was giving them room , hugging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell-bent on their destination : all the pain I reaped for my existence was a single remarkfrom the black-bearded Brando nearest to me ( " Hey . Look at it " ) , full of menace and contempt , and not really fathomable , for how could he , any more than the man on the boat , know me well enough to punish me for secret failings ? If I sweated certain moments of the next few days , flushed with/out warning by thoughts of life without an eyeball ( and of the unbearable moment when they calmly , skillfully , popped it ) , or life with crushed testicles , a maiming so fortuitous and pointless I 'd be without even writerly redress , well , it was the media and certain books , not these twelve good men , which were to blame . But perhaps the worst of it was that I 'd been through such things too many times before . Sweden of ' 6i , one late afternoon , walking the bucolic streets of Lund , with Britta , near the university , a motorcycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans about ten yards ahead . He pulls a bottle of aquavit from his back pocket , swigs , staggerson . From what I 'd already learned of Swedish drinking habits , there was nothing odd or ominous so far . Then he tossed away the bottle and from a sheath in his belt brought out a hunting knife , still moving , weaving . I slowed Britta down . If he turned on us , attacked us ( why had I learned nothingfrom the man on the boat ? ) , I would have had to defend her , court an early death , though I loved her no longer . Alone , I would have run ; he was too drunk to pursue . I had no skills . Why had I never learned karate , or even boxing , or been less supercilious about hand-to-hand instruction in the basic training days ? Why had I not honored my perceptions , acquired some tools , instead of advocating " non-violence , " forlorn wish more than precept , its soil precisely one 's defenselessness ? Abruptly the Swede turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind . With a relief close to glee , we tiptoed by . Into more leisurely dilemmas . There were no phones , no other houses nearby . A man would have disarmed him ( causing him no harm ) , deprived him of ' his twelve-inch blade , kept him quiet until help arrived , saved a life or two . Instead we went on to the university , where we had a cheap dinner , and I swiped a volume of Katherine Anne Porter 's stories , in English , which was just lying around . I scanned the papers for a week or so , dictionary at hand , sodden with guilt and loathing , but found no mention.  |p215So  I walked Glory home . I t was half a mile . We climbed the tenement stairs , I praised her poor apartment , and polished off some souring wine , the dregs of an old entertainment . I stayed only long enough to say that whatever her present doubts and fears , inclination to demean herself , she struck me as in all senses a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Christa , I arranged to come and see her three nights thence . Sarkissian had said she was going to the ballet that night ; she had asked me to come , but I 'd begged off on general grounds . I 'd planned to read , to work , or goof , or perhaps I 'd looked ahead to just such a present contingency . All right , if you wish , said Glory Green . She seemed to be a girl without a will , a lost little bright little very uptight miss , with legs and hips and eyes that promised everything . Christa , three nights later , changed her mind . It had only been a plan , she did n't have a ticket , she thought now she 'd stay home and read . I was furious at being crossed . I thought of going to a phone booth and canceling out , but did n't want to disappoint the child . I sat there squirming , feeling it build , until ten minutes before I was due . Then I put on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left . Thoughtfully she 'd laid in a fresh bottle of wine , and I 'd picked up another on the way . She was as desirable as before . Even so , the climate remained tense and odd , we labored for a context . I was sick of hearing about Henry , but not really up to steering her away . During a lull she leaned over my chair , fiddled with the radio , found some jazz , returned to her seat on the bed . I went to the john , and when I came out , joined her on the bed . I moved to her doll 's face for a kiss . Slowly , slightly , she averted her head . I hardly minded ; I felt fucking awful . I was losing my touch , or , much worse , losing interest in my touch . I rose , tried to smile , dusted my erection into place , went back to my chair , chatted an instant longer and departed . She saw me to the door . I felt her watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to walk around the block , I told Christa , but was stricken by nostalgia , and wandering south , wound up on Essex and Grand streets , two miles away , outside my former high school . Mmmhmm , she may have said . Early in April , close in time , came reminders of griefs gone by . Sandy phoned to invite me to a party at her place on the first of May ; she 'd been thinking of me , she said , she remained eager to expose me to her circle . I said I 'd be glad to come if I could bring a friend , meaning the one who sat just then beside me ; she said all right , though her enthusiasm dimmed . I thought I glimpsed Gillian from a bus window , all dressed in white , near Grand Central station , on the way back from visitingwith Frank ; I did n't get off , though I was tempted . From Britta in Malmo came a long letter containing a photo of her infant son , plus assorted marital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , at my suggestion , looked her up , and that at certain moments , peering at my sister 's nervous face , watching her all unconscious scratch an armpit , she thought she still missed me . But it was not until later in the month that I had occasion to recall the wracking gloom which was the worst ever of its kind , dwarfing melodramatic anguishover British nurses , mocking ancient unconsummated Provincetown passions : the thing with Esha , in particular the first few days after she left London , when I would receive her bright , bitchy postal cards from airline stops all the way to Kuala Lumpur , merry messages from Vienna , Beirut , Singapore ( " Cheerio and good luck , Abang ! " ) , which I would cradle upstairs from the mail table and read in outraged , retching tears in the bed-sitter which still stank of curry , still contained the loaded objects  --  the robe , the doll , the pair of battered shoes  --  she 'd left behind . But why bring up that dreary horror tale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' P217how I lived in the same room for three months with a monkeyfacedMalayan of twenty-three years of age who was a virgin when I met her , and flew off to her fat civil servant of a fiance ( whose photo , through it all , beamed from the mantelpiece ) at the end of that period in more or less the same condition ? A magnum of Old Ship , " British port-style wine , " was under the bed for nipping at , morning , noon and night , while I schemed and plotted the next frantic assault . But she fended me off each time , the tightest pussy in the realm , the fiercest feline will , versus its most sensitive , impatient erection , itchiest triggerfinger ; she had to have been as insane as I. Once in a while we went to the movies , and she had the temerity to play with my dick . Near the end of it she fought no more , but I continueddutifully to probe her with my fingers , having long since given up hope for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviveda not too ancient habit , went down to Soho and rented a tall , floppy blonde for half an hour , confiding my problems as I rested in her friendly body , and she counseled me to persevere , delivered a soothing lecture on the cunt , or the architectonicperversity of some ; thus armed , I raced back to the same brown dilemma , the same seething in the night , spilling my seed in sundry inaccurate places , grinding and girding for the next attempt . Sometimes I 'd try and rise above it all , lying in the single bed on the other side of the room , or even in my own room , two floors above , desperately thinking Zen ( a paid and paying student of the Japanese ) , mulling Daisetz Suzuki 's million English words on the virtues of shitsticks and silence , struggling for a little peace . Enough , no details  --  there are humiliations here , maltreatments of the cock and soul , I still can not touch . I mention it at all because her almost-kewpie face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life on the nineteenth of April , 1965 , and stunned as I may have been by the eeriness of it happening when it did , I was not , under the sun , really surprised.  |p218When  I knew Esha she was studying the phonetics of her own language at the University of London on a Malay governmentgrant , roughly two hundred dollars a month plus tuition , more than twice the bounty of the GI Bill , amidst a host of Africans and Asians at the school who were similarly occupied . Although , to be fair , there were a number of excolonialsas well , even in my own department , two Americans besides myself in a total enrollment of twelve people reading Japanese , not one of the more popular subjects , not one of the better departments , but scholarly second-rateness was the price Japan paid Britain for having never been colonized . Indifferentas I was , or was supposed to be  --  I was there buying time , seeing Europe and learning my craft on government money , my interest in things Japanese only slightly more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a state of academic outrage pretty nearly all the time , for few of the instructors , Japanese or British , gave a damn , fewer still could teach , and , anti-intellectual stance or no , I had spent those four years on the Heights , I had come by certain expectations . So I drank a lot of disgruntled fourpenny tea in the junior common room , and met Esha there . In due course she got her degree , or her diploma , whichever it was , went back to the man , was duly penetrated , had children , never even taught her subject , let alone engaged in research , but when some money turned up seven years later for a junket to phonetics departments at universities throughout the U.S. she was contacted , and by that time she was delighted to say yes . I had dreamt of her off and on , over the years , on two continents , and not only dreamt but fancied I saw her ( during a weird periodfor a few months after she went ) once or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , were not uncommon in Bayswater , around Russell Square , and down the Finchley Road ; but when I came in that Monday night , a little late , pleasantly high from the several beers with my student Mrs.p219Hale and our innocent stroll down to the river , and I asked Christa if there had been any calls , and she gestured to an indexcard alongside the telephone , I was struck with a sense of if not dejd vu then almost annoyance that I had not predicted exactly this occurrence , in exactly this manner , the magic name of one tormentor , Esha ben Hamid Don , scrawled in the spidery hand of another . Somebody up there was fucking with me , no question , and I was not a little put off by his continued absence of originality . " That 's really wild , " I said . " A woman I went to school with in London seven years ago . What the devil can she want ? Did she say ? " " She left her number , " Christa said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was staying , the Park-Sheraton Hotel . Christa had barely looked up from her The Tin Drum , or my The Tin Drum , one of the dutiful book-club volumes I was acquiring at the time ; they remained , after a glance and an inroad , pristine . Christa , otherwise idle , took them up . I doubt she got very far either , but further than I. Perhaps one clay in a less hectic moment I 'll manage to generate some interestin jailed homicidal faggots , or hunchback musical midgets , but not then , not now . She might at least have glanced up from the book , expressed an interest of whatever kind . Jealousywould have been the best , or pique of any sort . . . but nothing . I was on the phone inside of ten minutes . Hello , Esha , this is Jason Sams . Hello  --  corruptly coy as ever  --  this is Esha ben Hamid Don , do you remember me ? ( Did I remembermy mother ? ) I asked her how she was . She was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was married . Alas I was not , and what was she doing in these parts , and would she like to get together ? She was puzzlingly evasive , considering she had rung me up . She had only five days remaining in New York , with certain luncheons and excursions preplanned , with a university or two to visit ( I was less than pleased to seep220that alma mater graced her half-arse list ) , and could n't be pinned down . That 's too bad , I said , perhaps we 'll speak again . " Strange , " I said , returning from the study . " I just called her back and she was very remote . I ca n't figure why she called in the first place . " " I think I might have put her off . " " You ? How ? " " She asked if I was Mrs. Sams . " " What did you say ? " " No. , . " OIL " " I think she assumed I was the maid . " " The maid ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come on like a maid ? " " No . " " Then why should she think it ? And what difference would it make ? " " I do n't know . Can we drop it , Jason ? " " Whose maid works until ten o'clock ? " And so the next afternoon , Tuesday , when Sarkissian stormed out around one o'clock literally behind my back , for unfathomable reasons , as I sat bald and vulnerable at my silentmachine , I rang Esha back from anger and bruised curiosity , and although she was just about to leave for a Statue of Liberty cruise she would be back in time for dinner , and yes we could have it together . I happened to see Frank that afternoon , although I had seen him also the day before . He was juggling me wildly in those times . Man to man , as an equal , privy to life 's little ironies , I asked him to hazard a guess as to who I would be dining with in two hours ' time . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckled , said My , my , when I told him . I was n't sure he had the picture . You remember her , do n't you ,  |p221her  pert , swishing walk , her sweaty kabaya , and what happened  --  whatshe did to me  --  abroad ? Of course , Dino , I mean Jason , of course he did . He had all my ladies , he assured me , perfectly straight in his head . Is n't it a gas , Frank , how one 's tiny life pursues and catches up , whatever evasive action one takes , however one struggles to get well ? Disconcerting and exciting , he seemed to agree . We had only half an hour to go , had I brought in a dream ? I met her in the lobby of her hotel . I was a few minutes late , but I had the advantage . She looked right through me twice . Finally I touched her shoulder from behind , and reintroducedmyself . She wheeled , did a double take , made some feeble joke about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd borne it way back then , it seemed a small enough price to pay for the treasure I was after , and I had no real defense in any case , for the thrust of it concerned my nationality . Back there , in the Eisenhower years , we were all willynilly ambassadors for the nation . They held me personallyresponsible for Time magazine , she and her plump and pimply Venezuelan girl friend , whose constant presence , there at the beginning , I suffered almost gladly , conceiving it to be some obscure East Asian price I was obliged to pay to ever get her off alone . Time magazine , was the gist , seemed to know beans about Kuala Lumpur or Caracas . My reply , that this did n't surprise me , cut no ice . And do all Americans go bald at twenty-six , look like a monk from behind ? Ah ho , that 's rich , girls , but you really should n't generalize . My own sad story  --  are you listening ?  --  has to do with some terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or my generally spicy life in Japan . I was only twentytwowhen it happened . Oh yes , they knew about that life , or could imagine it , the evil footloose GI on foreign soil . I doubted if they could . In due course South America did fade , I moved from my remote , shabby basement room for a guineap222a week in the boondocks of Highbury Hill to a barely more pleasant place at three times the rent which had just come free in the rooming house she lived in , in Bayswater , but spent most of my time for the next few months in the room two floors below . I learned to suck ( and like ) the substance of raw eggs from a small opening in the shell . I became , in the desperateneed to beat her more than half the time , a minor pingpongchamp ( she slammed with equal power , but no finesse , from either side ) . I shot my seed in Esha 's mouth , anon , glued shut her armpits , slaughtered nations in the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , well-nigh felt her ovaries with every finger , but I completely understood her gleeful devastating claim to bridal purity when she left me for the last time at the air terminal behind Victoria Station , July of ' 58 , a semblance of tears on all sides . I 'd never fucked her after all , she had a right to feel triumphant . " Jason ? Is that you under all that hair ? " I smiled . The self-same style , the inane jockeying . I t could hardly upset me , as it had in former times . A widening bald spot in one 's twenties is less easy to defend , but this  --  it was a splendid beard . I felt not the slightest need to explain it away , or how it had come to be . It was in Christmas of ' 59 that Britta and I locked up the Barcelona flat and journeyed to the islands , Majorca , Ibiza , and on the last day of the old year , while I slept on a Spanish tub between Ibiza and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin with three male strangers , I was attacked in the night by the one of the three who was a madman , chiefly on the head and jaw , fists and keys his only weapons , so that while I was glad , in retrospect , to have survived , and made some literary capital of it by and by , I found in the period immediately after that I could not chew or shave , and when the beard arrived , the beard which I had for three preceding European years successfully avoided , I liked it and kept it . Britta , a bourgeois if well-traveled Swede ( but a square was what I had been seeking ; I had the impression , after Esha , of exotica enough , enough excitement in my life ) , liked it considerably less , but in time it  --  mil pardons !  --  grew on her too . I kept the thing in some form or other a good little while , diddling and tampering only  --  chin alone , then with sideburns , then fulsome and full , removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of identity games , but merely confused myself and my Irish barmaid of the time , kept it thereafter for so long a time that even my mother ( no early advocate ) was dismayed when I removed it next , the time of her mother 's funeral , as a private sign of mourning and in order to see who loved me for myself . Whoever they were , I was not in their number ; I let it come back , where it has remained . But even by the time of that meeting in the ParkSheratonHotel it had a difficult , time-tested history , I could barely be needled by the best , let alone by this brown , bouncy lady , with whose subtlety and sense of humor , even at my worst , I 'd never been enamored . " Yes , it 's me , Esha . How are you ? " " I 'm fine ! Well ! Can you show me the city ? " We agreed to a drink , away from the hotel . I squired her through the Seventh Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoddy neighborhood and the jostling , blindeyednatives than for my own appearance . I steered her into the first bar which seemed reasonably posh , and we took a booth . It was dark , male commuters were unwinding , there were canapes . I ordered martinis , looked her over . In that light , at least , she had n't changed at all . I listened , acquiring such data on her mission and travels as I have already passed on . I gave her Denby 's name and address , since Tucson was to be a stop ; it was time I reciprocated , turned things around , sent some female goods his way . I ordered another drink but went before it came to phone Christa , inform her of my dinnerplans ; there was someone in the booth , someone waiting ,  |p224so  I revamped the priorities . This dark lady , this mirage , would vanish soon enough . My Armenian problem ( should she even be at home ) could wait awhile . When I got back Esha turned the tables , fairly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been kind ; then out of gallantry , or else to give us both some sense of continuity , I confessed that my volume , which she claimed to be eager to acquire , contained in point of fact a tale I had been writing in those very times  --  the woolly adventures of a Jewish GI in Japan  --  god remembered how , for my memory of those days seemed fairly well exhausted by wine drunks and failed Zen and mad thrustings at that prick-proof pussy and resultant anguish , but clearly this last condition had not yet poisoned my vision of Sams the scribe ; that would come later ; rather , at twenty-six , it seemed I was obliged to get some typing done to save what I valued of my life . Huzzahs , at least , for that . We decided on a Pakistani restaurant in the East Village , nostalgic tribute to her home cooking in our room on HerefordRoad , and the countless other curried meals we 'd taken in W. i Indian restaurants ; also , three weeks from Kuala Lumpur , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all  --  many 's the hamburger I sought , the subhungers I slaked , in places like Kobe and Tarragona . Before we left the bar I felt once more impelled to check in at the hearth , assuminga hearth , conjuring it by the call , but the booth was again occupied . I waited there awhile , then let it go . I owed her little ; she had herself accounted for my present whereabouts by storming out that afternoon . Esha and I taxied to the Koh-I ; Noor . She pulled rank on the waiters about the slowness of the service , subtle failures in the seasoning , quite regal really iii manner and garb , drank a bourbon , her eyes sparkled ; the meal was a success . We finished around half-past nine . I could have fucked her on the spot , or as quickly placed he , . in a cab , mission accomplished , case closed , as the lunch withp225Sandy in the January days had seemed to round a circle , but she wanted to go to the Village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to pick up the restaurant tab , for she 'd carried me often enough in olden times , her seventy British pounds a month to my thirty-nine , and if she needed to recreatethis aspect of those far from halcyon days , I was not going to hinder . But from kept man to tour leader was no giant step . I sighed , complied , and we walked west . Dizzy Gillespie , she told me , was at the Gate . She 'd always been an amateur jazz buff of a sort , we 'd been to see a touring Ella on the Kilburn High Road all those lives before , and she was almostgleeful now , as I rushed her past the Bowery , insisting she would pay for everything . Gillespie 's neither here nor there . Between sets we danced , when the records were shmaltzy enough . We 'd danced in the old country too , or done whatever we were doing now , and she remembered my phrase for it , " the high school foxtrot , " and once she brought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , around two , we left , swung hands a moment in the open air , strolled down MacDougal Street , then I took her back to her hotel . We necked a trifle in the cab ; her mood , as I gauged it , was mixed . We entered the seedy lobby . She responded with a rote , arch surprise to my rote , arch interest in seeing the inside of her room . She did not object . We rose to the eleventh floor under the circumspect scrutiny of the elevator operator , definitely an odd couple . She had narrow , shabby lodgings in the second-rate hotel . It would be interesting to learn why so many foreigners go there , so many delegations . I sat on the couch , which was also the bed , and which tended to slide out from under if you leaned back against the wall . I saw a half-full bottle of blended whiskey , which she explained away in some now-forgotten , satisfactoryfashion ; she had n't had anything to drink since the watereddown Old Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , I do n't think she sipped more than once from her glass . She sat a few feet from me on the couch and talked about her marriage . Her mate she described as pedestrian , insensitive , authoritarian ( I 'd warned her way back then he 'd be a bloody Asian in the end ) , and more and more , in recent times , she 'd had to punish him for his transgressions . " How do you do that , Esha ? " " I pretend to be asleep when he wants something . " " What does he want ? " " When he comes in late and wants to . . . sleep with me . I pretend to be asleep . " Ingenious . At the very least , in character . The man had not approved of this present trip , which was one reason she had made it . The years , I thought again , had never touched her . And because I thought this , I thought she still moved me , and that I had to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I listened , I touched her hand . Expressing dissent , I stroked her hand . Nodding agreement , I took it , dropped it , gulped some whiskey , and when her monologue ran down I filled the gap with lips and body , a chaste continuation of our last kiss in the cab . She seemed agreeable , as also to the hand which traveled round her shoulders , down her back ; in response to pressure , her tongue essayed some kittenish forays which would have warned a wiser man , but he was long abed , and the character I had become hoped and assumed she was horny . My own interest , if more visible , was less easy to describe , but it would clearly do . Motives be damned  --  much better me for her post-i London needs than some potbellied phonetician in her travels . Fairly rapidly , battling that subversive sliding couch , I freed a brown breast , I could maneuver a kabaya well as any man , and the sight of that dun , stippled boob was almost rewardenough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to retreat . She was breathing hard and fast , but withp227her eyes closed she was shaking her head from side to side in the blind , willful negative which contradicted sanity and her body , and which I remembered in a rush from our early ( courtship ! ) days , so I did now what I did then , thrust a hand up under her tight sarong , and achieved , once more , the bottoms of her secret knees . Where the thing unfastened ( from the waist ? ) I 'd never learned , and now as then ( " This is silly , Jason . No no , please do n't " ) I knew that no help would be forthcoming . But I persevered , jabbed , feinted , forced , found the commencement of a thigh and the words to go with it , and when I heard them again after so many years I knew I had missed them , for with Christa even in our better days we 'd fucked for fucking 's sake , with a minimum of dialogue , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman I could still admit to tenderness . Sweetpuss . Brownmiss . Dearlove . I missed you all the time . I need you still . Heartfelt , godhelp , they may have been , but they opened no doors , undid no knots , and in my sense of the lateness of the hour , and the shortness of our days , I did open my fly . And she responded , " Oh . Do n't . Naughty . Wick-ed . " At which I swallowed shame and rage and carried on . Here . Look . It 's your bright-eyed and downtrodden friend . Remember him ? His dumb and singlemindedneeds ? How you would toy with him for minutes which seemed hours , or as long as I would let you , and for some damn reason called him Michelangelo ? This long Michelangelo has waited , this patient he has been , and I took her hand and placed it on my prick . She squeezed it gently , her head turned away , and it produced for her , in gratitude , a throbbing crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said , " Please put it away , " and tried to reinsert it in my pants . This was not just then possible . But the blush did me in . My humiliation now was so profound , I had so far outdone myself , she was embarrassed for me , nothing more . I stood , crammed the dwindling pecker back in place , reassembledp228myself , finished off my drink , fixed her with my most scathing , futile stare , shook my head , and slammed out the door . I had a bellyful of piss , but I would not bestow it in her lodgings . It was a great relief to reach the open air . A cab was waiting outside the hotel . I was further restored by the last inning of the Met game from Los Angeles . It was still in progress when we got to my corner ; the middle-aged Negro , a mensch , dropped his flag and we sat there listening to the miracle . Dogged ! Ancient ! Warren Spahn , battling the record book , went into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodgers . It was unlikely to hold up , given his years and the ragtag club behind him , and when he walked the first man up in the ninth , I began to hope for quick release , for him and for my bladder , the home run right now , rather than the agonizing , piecemeal , frittering away of the ball game . But Spahn 's psychologywas not mine ; he achieved two quick outs , the runner advancing to second , and he ran out the string on Maury Wills . Wills fouled off several , then grounded to Macmillan to end the game . How anticlimactic , in the spectator sports , are the seconds following a triumph . All the same , the driver and I congratulated each other , and I walked down the block as jaunty as I could . And damned if some fraction of the long night had n't been redeemed . She was awake when I entered , or I woke her . I mumbled hello toward her stirring sounds and went directly to the toilet . I took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full blast , both taps , trying to wash the Far East from my life . I scrubbed my face and neck and furiously brushed my teeth , the water still pounding . ( Esha , of course , would not let me off this easily : two days later she would ring up and invite us out to dinner , myself and my " friend " ; I had some small trouble being civil , but none in saying no . Then there would be the cheery , pointless letters from Chicago , Tucson and Los Angeles , her next three stops , recalling the postcards of yore ,  |p229when  she 'd escaped me then . And there was the letter from Denby  --  how I regretted that charity , now !  --  which said in relevant part : A tableau to remember : Today I attended by request a companyluncheon for the celebration of a foreign guest on tour . The guest , a Malay dish ( well , there goes the plot ; anyhow . . ) , lovely and dusky and plugged into a 220 circuit somewherejust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , smoothly , " Oh , you are D. Denby . I believe we have a mutual acquaintance , Jason Sams . I knew him in London , and have recently come . . . " All of which put me countless points up on the other limp pricks in the cafeteria . Very very honmono , *that one . This surely did not escape you , and for the points , if not for Esha herself , my hisses . I check back through the files for details in your London notes , just in case Malaya beckons . . . ) I stripped to my underwear in the john , and came out ready for bed . " You washed very thoroughly . " " I washed . . . for god 's sake . I was brushing my teeth , Christa . " As indignant , full of horror as I tried to sound . How like her to take the offensive , assume the other 's guilt to turn attentionfrom her own , and use his sense of it as the lever with which to rebuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw myself , standing at the basin , trousers lowered , rubbing alien pussy from my groin before daring to share her bed . Well , she was full of shit , it had n't happened , however much I may have wished it ; I brought a full , sore scrotum from the fray , and where in hell had she been since one o'clock in the afternoon ? I climbed into bed , we shared a silence . As always , I was the one unable to sustain it. * Jap. for " the genuine article . "  | " I had dinner with that Malayan lady . I tried to call you a couple of times , but I could n't get through . Then she wanted to tour the Village and we went to see Dizzy Gillespie . Have you ever heard him ? Good , funky sounds . " Silence . " And you ? Where have you been ? What have you been up to ? " " Not very much . " " Mmmhmm . Maybe if you had n't torn out of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . " " Good night , Christa . " " Good night . " Yes ? ? For her , in such a mood , this was loquacity . I did n't , then , request she amplify , spin the monosyllable out ; things being what they were , I took , alone , what I could find in it of sustenance . " Jesus . A microcosmic repeat , seven years after . How could I go through with it , Frank ? Why am I so fucked up ? Blueballs at thirty-three , and living with someone at the time ! And then , when I got home , she pulls that You washed very thoroughly ' crap . Man , I ca n't recall when I ever felt as bad as I did in bed the next morning . Tossing around in that roiling shit , going through it all again . . . " " Why did n't you fuck Christa ? " Frank said . His diction did not please me , but I understood its import , and addressed myself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no real context . She would have just been a way to get my rocks off . A convenience , I would have been using her , you know ? Anyway , it was n't her I wanted . Besides which , she was still sick , or claimed she was . Also "  --  I meant this to be light , but the humor , once I said it , evaded me as well  --  " she reminded me of my mother . "  |p231That  was Thursday , April 22 . Saturday morning I went out and bought the TV set , displayed it , but she showed no pleasure . Then we locked up and took the ride to Staten Island . Just for the sea and space , but once there I decide to try Korvette 's , surprise the old man at his pretzel and ices stand . I 've never seen him at his most recent employment , he 's apt to be pleased . Having met Christa twice before , once when he just dropped in and again at the seder , he might begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his problem . Long , complicated bus ride . We missed him ( and a lift back ) by only fifteen minutes . Only works a half-day Saturdays . Should have phoned first . Lunch in the cruddy snackbar , then back via two buses . Waiting between them , by the miniature golf course , in a drizzle , wishing for a drink . . . she becomes ( dour up to then ) girlish gay . Picks up a branch and draws a circle in the dirt around herself . Flashes for the first time in a while the dimpled smile . " This is my magic circle . I 'm safe inside it . " " Crazy , " I say . ( Safe from what ? ) Whence come these sudden dislocating shifts of mood ? They make me uneasy . But I 'll try to match the gay one . But on the bus she 's her gloomy self again . Home , I say " Pss ! Pss ! " at the door to the apartment , fiercely grieving , and she 's browned off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because I miss him , goddamn it . " Perhaps three Saturdays ago . Mrs. Gross broke the news . Stops me in the street , mammothin spaceshoes , and in her shit-eating way : " Mr. Sams , do you find yourself missing a cat ? " He 's been gone overnight , is all . But she describes how her husband saw the sanitation truck sweep him up in the small hours , if not what hit him . I race home , sure I 'll find him there . No . Goddamn it , I still suspectfoul play . Christa 's unmollified . Suddenly I know why  --  she 's accusingme of accusing her of wiping him out , since it was she let him into the yard the night he found his way to the street and was smashed by the truck . If that 's what I 'm doing , and it 's notp232impossible , she 's right to be pissed : some other night , some other passage to the world , some other car . . . death was written in his paws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass into the back room and type awhile . The outlook improves . She 's just sealing a letter when I come out . Switch on the new toy , flop on the couch , watch some early Bacall-Bogart thing . Mildly entertaining . She watched too . We raid the icebox separately . Then it 's bedtime . No problem . She 's sick . Sleep fairly well . End of Saturdaynight . So what happened ? How alcohol doth aid the flow and dim the sense . Perhaps . Stay with it anyway . Woke refreshed on Sunday , brewed a pot of coffee , went out for cigarettes , avoided buying The Times . Returned and tried to cultivate that sinewy , fragile mood . It 's only nine . Free of interruption for a while . Each day she seems to rise a little later than the one before  --  perhaps a courtesy ? I work on the Dinelli/tape-recorder bit ; he attempts to talk Europe into the machine with his buddy Frank as audience . " All right , Frankie , turn the bastard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get . . . " , etc . Move it nicely for a couple of hours . Paris . Barcelona . Alicante . Seven very rough pages . I suspect they 'll hold up because I 'm not really tempted to reread them . Need more coffee . Try to be quiet , but rattle the pot on the stove . She stirs . Not yet , my love . I might squeeze out another line or two . Tiptoe back in and shut the door . But I 'm done , or the rhythm is gone . Do n't sweat it . The day has been decentlylaunched . She knows it too , she must have heard the clacking . In situations of this sort , she 's in the habit of knockingbefore coming in , and going to the closet for her clothes . It is my custom , then , to turn , offer some greeting or comment , so she wo n't feel she is disturbing anything , which most often she is not . She lives here as well  --  I try to spare her any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I labor to spare myselfthe discomfort I would feel at rendering her uneasy by sop233meretricious a stance : the writer at his desk , tuned to the celestialmusic , whom a mortal fart or football would disrupt  --  whereas in fact most often I massage my groin , or drink my coffee , or squeeze out at best the shit one tenth of which with luck and twenty rewrites can be saved ( and yet these drunken entries come so easy ) . . . If the words are there , they 're there . If not , not . A pleasantry or two exchanged with one 's companion , whom the topography of the place constrainsto enter so she may dress herself , is surely not amiss . Indeed , there have been times I wished she would n't knock , simply come in and take what she needed ; the joint tiptoeing is disheartening ; since she does n't wait to be invited , anyway ( which I appreciate ) , but knocks and enters , the knocking can appear overnice , perhaps sardonic , maybe worse . Am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a gesture ? If so , this Sunday , I 'm jolted sane again . She came bursting in with no semblance of a by-your-leave , force enough to crack the doorknob into the wall , flashed to the closet , grabbed some things and jerked back inside . Leaving me with a half-uttered good morning and an unmet twinkling gaze . This is what does it  --  the unacknowledgedeyeballs , offering amity . Hard enough to make the effort , humiliating to have it ignored . I could n't even feel I was responsible for her mood . I was watching a film of her , alone in the room . Christa , mad . Well , up yours too , pussycat . Kicked over the u-start-it cactus kit just now on the way back from the john . Beyond repair . Vermiculite all over the kitchen floor . It was coming along nicely , slow and hardy ; too bad . Meat and gristle for the symbol-minded . We very nearly made it through without a word . April 25 , Sunday . She fed herself from time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple juice , I did n't look to see . Salami sandwich for me , slabs of Danish blue . I played her invisibility game , despising us both . Some atmosphere ! I wished ( and as fervently did not : in a mood of this kind who knew where shep234would go , of what she was capable ) that she would get the hell out , walk it off , disappear herself , and she no doubt wished the same for me , for she was scribbling continuously in her diary , and I had to be a distraction , even when not wandering by her through the living room . I took a sandwich and the radio out into the garden . Tuned to WBAI , a South Vietnamese exforeignminister in exile in Paris or something of the sort was gently and soberly explaining in lilting English that democracyand freedom , admirable concepts both , were perhaps not being most efficiently served by the maiming and murder and dispossession of his countrymen , destruction of their land . . . his American friends should , he suggested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoned tone cataloguingthe horrors being spread in the name of noble abstractionsthat were rendered obscene in the process , his need to find a reasoned tone , which boiled the blood , caused the shame and rage at being a subject of this grubby government and doing not one damn thing to bring it down . I wanted to call her out so she could listen too . But did not . Hell , she was busy , she was writing up her life . And what if she really did n't care , took real umbrage at being interrupted , saw the invitationmerely as a ploy to break the ice ( which in part it would be ) ? Why should I even try to share with so sullen and private a bitch the things which really moved me ? When friends drop by and Vietnam comes up and we pool our indignation , she affects a bored silence , or perhaps is bored . And after they leave , I think she may be right : she does nothing , so she says nothing ; while we sit there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains and limbs intact anguishing our novels and our bank accounts , outrage our sole contribution , our virtue our reward . So I heard it out alone , then came back in and switched on the ball game . Sat on the other end of the couch from where she was . Kept the sound off . She paid no mind . Mays tripledp235over Swoboda 's glove . Kranepool made a great stop on McCoveyand threw wild to the plate . We were already a run behind . Would she be interested in this , perhaps , New York vs . San Francisco , the relevant regional battle ? Christ . If anything could engage her less than the war in Vietnam , it must be the war on the diamond . We 've already discussed it , prior to my buying the TV set . It 's an art , I tell her , it 's a science , the poor man 's ballet . So screwed up she has me I apologize for baseball , or my interest , mustering a cultural overlay . And of course it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , trapped in a maze of strategy and statistics , the antics of mercenaries made up as heroes , since the age of nine . Mmmhmm , she says . As unimpressedby my shaky defense as I think she would be by the spectacle . And maybe I 'm wrong . She 's really a buff , she loves the game . And all I am doing is assigning to her my own ( addicted ) self-contempt . And then the doorbell rang . I could guess who it was , and walked down the hallway to answer . " Father ! " " Hello , Pisacano . " " What 's shakin ' , baby ? " " Nothin ' . Working . Right in the middle of something . " " Not watchin ' the game ? " " No , man . " " Come for a walk . It 's a groovy day . " " Impossible . Too much to do . Another time . " " Okay , father . Later . " " Yeah . " I go back down the hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lie . " That was Pisacano . He wanted to go for a walk . " " Mmmhmm . " Revealing nothing . Not even looking up . Scribbling away . I go into the back room . Sit at the desk awhile . But there'sp236nothing there I want to or am able to do . I hear her going to the can . I remember the ball game . Go back inside . Her diary 's open , on the couch . I sit midway between TV and diary . No sweat , I 'll hear her coming out . Lean over , heart pounding as I fight the awkward angle , her damnable script . Pisacano just stopped by . J sent him packing . . . His suspicions about P and me . Why enlighten or defend . Interested , if I am , only for further insights into J.Surely he is gross ( his word for others ) . ( The passover servicein the Bronx he took me to . Odd , squabbling family , sick . He resembles his father . ) Night he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instructive , plaintive , " you left too soon . " Yes . Gagging , rushed to the bathroom . Could n't , would n't swallow . Did n't feel loving enough . Stirrings in the john and flushing sounds . I sit up , lock into the ball game . She comes out , moves by me to the porch , stands in the door a moment , doubles back , straining to be casual , initiates conversation for the first time that day : " Who 's winning ? " " You 're losing , Sarkissian . " She pays no attention to this , whatever it might mean , but picks up her book and takes it to the porch , to her rocking chair . In order to update her account ( I learn the next morning ) , her instant playback : Left this momentarily exposed . Doubt if he noticed . But must be more careful . Four P.M. now . Tired . The phone no longer rings this end . J. Sams lives with a girl , the news is all over town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it more . Something might emerge . We get through top237dinnertime . I cook a steak and broccoli without checking if this menu moves her , but make enough for two . When it 's almostdone I say , " Some dinner ? " She looks up briefly  --  " All right . "  --  goes on smoothly writing . She has style . I lay out the meal , invite her to table . Nothing changes . We chew in noisy silence . My fury mounts . Breaking bread should be a happy time . Chance for a detente , at least . But I ca n't begin it . The steak is rubber in my mouth . I go for the radio , turn it on , listen to the tail end of the doubleheader . I ca n't look at her now . Wolf the rest , shut the radio , put my plate in the sink , go for a jacket , start out . Ca n't make it all the way . Must turn , announce , " I 'm going out , " maybe for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I slam into the evening . Not an easy neighborhood to get out of . Walk south down Second Avenue , into the turf of my childhood . Landmarks remain  --  theYiddish theatres , dispensary , Ottendorfer Library , Third Street Mission to the Jews . Stop at the window . Exhortations , in Yiddish , English , Hebrew , to embrace the living Jesus . Enough to make tsadikim of apostates , that clammy appeal . Still , you have to feel compassion , it must be a task , in that section of the world , with small rewards . Wander due east , down to the ancestral hearth , look up into the windows .

" She means she can no longer see the Empire State Building from the bedroom window . It 's a genuine loss , and I sympathize . But she would no more move away , relinquish that headlock on her martyrdom , than he is about to leave the neighborhood he grew up in  --  he could n't stand to be a mile from the junkyard , and his mirror image , for more than a day or two ; which she knows .

Leaving it for me to handle . And I have not yet worked it out , not even the essentials , whether a man is his cock or his joy of a sunset . It was a hell of a way to be wounded .

( Addressed me thus that afternoon as if she did n't exist , " Come for a walk , " as if no one else could be in the apartment . ) More than once I 've walked into the house and they 've been on the phone ( always incoming , she says ) , or else she tells me that he 's called . ( " Whatp245did he want ? " " He did n't say . " ) This often at a time he knows or ought to know I could n't possibly be in , say the night of my class .

A cat person , lanky , freckled redhead , she condoles with me on my loss . To Pisacano , when she talks at all , she 's acerbic to the point of nastiness  --  wifely . Clearly she knows him for a while . Even with his turnover , he has a way of keeping four or five for long periods circling in the background . Much wine . He 's in great braying form . Ignores his lady 's barbs . I talk to her from politeness . She does some high-level public relations thing .

I want to rise , and run him out , a wrathful giant , but am in no way up to such a scene , and even if I brought it off , how would I deal with her afterwards ? Smack her around ? Be contrite and ashamed ? Would she rage , and be right ? Is it her fault she elevates every prick in sight ? Or that I surround myself with back-stabbing friends ? Or that she deals with it as she does ? And how much can it mean if they carry on under my nose ? Why does it take this shape ? Why must one be forced to choose between one 's female and one 's friends ? Earlier , he said , " Why do you call her by her last name , father ? You want to keep her at a distance ? " At which she chimes in , almost simpers , " He does , yes . " Paul leaves at last . The world dips and spins . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weave down the block to the corner . Smash into a spiked iron fence , rip the pocket , gash my hand , bruise my side . Stagger back , wash the cut , flop on the couch in the rear room . She 's on the phone , seems to be talking to her mother . But she 's cleared the table , put the dishes in to soak . Tossing and groaning on the couch , miserable , feel I might puke for the first time in years . Bolt up , battle it back . I hear her making up the bed . She comes in at last to see if it 's fatal , steps on my glasses . An accident , they were right there on the floor , the room was dark . She cracks a lens . I find this funny at the time . She 's rather tender , wondering if I 'm all right . I go blindly to the john , splash water on my face , pee lustily dead center , strip , fall into bed ( she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuck her . Ca n't come , the effort fights off nausea , drop off on her body . Wake perhaps seconds later as she 's shoving me off . Roll over , pass out for the night . Sundays figure large .

She took it with her when she went to the coast , forgot it in her mother 's house , sent for it , it arrives ( in a package with clothes and art supplies ) in smithereens . She shows me the covering letter : " Dearest Christa , I looked into the cigarette package you asked for . I do n't know what the powder is , nor why you need it , but I 'm sure you 'll be careful . . . " We smile together at the cultivated ignorance , the helpless advice .

I go back to the book section . Hear her tossing . Tune it out awhile . But when I look again she seems to be in pain . I offer to call a doctor . She shakes her head , dismisses me again . Much later , cured , she tells me what she 's done. **25;10987;TOOLONG ; otherwise they 'd cut their throats before they started . It 's too bad they have to get so tarnished along the way . He stabbed his flashlight into the sand and stood up , wishing the night were already over . He did n't like these expeditions ; they were long and risky and involved painfullyprecise navigation , and he had reached the age where he preferred a night in bed to a night at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this for free , which made the discomfort and the danger all the more unnecessary . Thinking of a night in bed made him think of Emilie , the house girl , and he decided to make an appointment with her for the following night or the night after . And here was another sign of his debasement ; what passed for love in his life had to be prearranged like an appointment with the dentist , which made everything about as spontaneous as a Christmas pageant and not a great deal more stimulating . Still , Emilie was an expert at her work and even gave the impression she was enjoying herself , which was more than could be said for everybody . To pass the time , he reviewed the various women he 'd had connections with , and he found the list not only disappointingly short but also not really worth remembering . There was the girl in Toulon with gold teeth and a red wig , and the one in Strasbourg who liked to bark like a dog , but neither of these provided a man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to live the life of an outcast , he ought at least to have some memories , but most of what he could remember simply depressed him . And the French are supposed to be great lovers , he thought . Either I 've been extraordinarily unlucky , or else my parents were Germans and did n't tell me . The idea of his father with a Meerschaum pipe andp101Lederhosen amused him , and he smiled for the first time in several days . By now it was almost dark , and he picked up the flashlightand practiced the dah-dit-dah-dit of the challenge . Then he gave the dah-dah-dit of the reply . Next he shone the light about the beach , resting it briefly on the tractor and canvas-covered wagon he 'd brought along for hauling the ammunition cases , and he wondered how big a load he was going to have to put in his boat . He had n't yet put the other shipment aboard , because he wanted to see how big the whole load was before he started piling it in . What with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave some behind . Things were going to be ticklish enough as it was , without having the added hazard of an overloaded boat . From out at sea a light winked , and then again , and then it gave dit-dah-dit-dah  --  AA . That meant " Identify yourself , " but it was also the challenge backward , and Grimond wondered if it was a mistake . It would be just like these people to send the challenge backward , he thought , and he blinked out the reply . But again came the AA , so he flashed the challenge , to which the other light replied with dah-dit-dah or K , meaning " Come . " What the hell is going on here ? Grimond thought , and he sent the challenge again and received another K. He decided to give up the **26;11014;TOOLONG , and sent off " All clear . Come in . " This received a Roger , and Grimond relaxed . At last , he thought . They really do make things difficult for themselves . Stackpole , the Icarus ' Signalman First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him in the boat . " He says , All clear come in , ' Captain , " he said . " He does n't say what the all clear ' means . "  | " Well , we wo n't find out sitting here , " Evers replied . " Let 's go in and see . " He turned to the men at the oars and said , " Give way together , " and slowly the crowded boat , towing the two rafts behind it , headed for the shore . Five days in the boat had left the men at the point of exhaustion , but the prospect of reaching an inhabited island cheered them to the extent that they all started talking together . " Hey , Flags , ask him if he 's got any dames , " said Proxmeyer , the Radioman Second . " I could use a couple right about now . " " What do you mean , a couple ? " said Latch , his watchmate . " You all of a sudden got two cocks or something ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the circumstanceseverybody found it hilarious ; Lieutenant Fergusonslapped Latch on the back and almost stunned him , and even Ensign Tuttle was forced to smile . Then Tuttle leaned toward Evers . " What do you want me to do , Captain ? " he asked . " Should I send Jackson to look for a repair shop ? " " First , let 's see what 's on the island , " Evers replied . " I kind of doubt they 're equipped to repair a boat engine . " " Jackson says he does n't need much , " Tuttle said . " He just needs to take it down and repair the water damage . " " Let 's see , " Evers repeated . " Maybe they have a boat we can borrow . " " Or a radio , " put in Andersen , the Radioman First . " If they 've got a transmitter , we 're in fat-cat city . " " I would n't bank on that , " said Evers . " I do n't think this island is even on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know where this is ? "  | " No , sir , " Ferguson replied , in a formal tone . " It could be any one of a number of places . " " I thought the Navigator was supposed to know our positionat all times , " said Tuttle . " Listen , you  --  " Ferguson began , but Evers stopped him . " All right , " Evers said . " That 'll be enough of that . Mr. Tuttle , your concern is with the engines , not navigation . " As they approached the beach they could hear the sound of small waves lapping the sand , and in the beam of Stackpole'slight they saw a man standing near the water 's edge . His flashlight played on them , and the glare made dazzling circles as he moved it back and forth . Then the boat grated on the sand , and two men near the bow jumped out and held it , and the man on the beach began to dance and shout . " No ! No ! No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can not land here ! This is private property ! Go away ! " " Keep your shirt on , Charlie , " said Proxmeyer , one of those holding the boat . " Nobody 's going to hurt you . " " Go away ! " the man repeated . He splashed into the water and tried to push Proxmeyer back , and Proxmeyer took one hand off the gunwale and hit him in the face , knocking him down . He jumped up and started for Proxmeyeragain , but this time Andersen and Jackson grabbed his arms and held him back . Ferguson vaulted over the gunwale and drew his .45 automatic . The man had dropped his flashlight on the sand , where it made a long puddle of light , and Latch picked it up and shone it on the struggling figures . Then everybody got out of the boat and began shouting , and above the noise came Ferguson'sp104voice saying , " Stand back and let me shoot the son of a bitch ! Let go of him , and stand back ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting . " Mr. Ferguson , put down that gun ! " There was silence , in which Ferguson 's heavy breathing could be heard , and then in the dancing light of the two flashlights Ferguson was seen to lower the muzzle of his pistol . " Put it in its holster , " Evers said , quietly , and Ferguson obeyed . " And do n't take it out unless I tell you to , " Evers concluded , as he climbed out of the boat . " Let 's have some light on this gentleman , " he said , and then , to Andersen and Jackson , " Let him go . " The men released his arms , and Evers saw that his eyes were wide with fright . " We 're not going to harm you , " he said . " We understood you to tell us to come in . " " It was a mistake , " said the man . " I did n't know who you were . You must leave . Please ! " " Let 's start at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these men are from my ship . We 've been shipwrecked , and we need help . " The man digested this information , then said , " How long ago ? " " Five days . " " Mon dieu . Was there an explosion ? " " Yes . Why ? " " Are you Americans ? " " That 's right . " " From the Navy ? " " Just a minute . Who are you ? " " Paul Grimond . I live here . " " How do you do . " They shook hands , and Evers said , " Now , what we need is  --  "  | " I must ask you to leave , " Grimond said . " This moment , if you will be so kind . " " That 's impossible . Our boat engine needs repair , and  --  " " Captain , ask him if he has a radio , " Andersen said . " That 'll settle the whole thing . " " Do you have a radio transmitter ? " Evers asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nothing . Now , please  --  " " Captain , there 's a light out at sea , " said Bromley , the telephone talker . They all turned , and saw a small light winking in the darkness . " Please ! " Grimond said , his voice rising . " I beg of you ! " " See what he wants , " Evers said to Stackpole , and the Signalman flashed a K. There was more blinking from the sea , and Stackpole made a K again , and finally turned to Evers . " All he sends is Charlie , Captain , " he said . " Charlie , Charlie , Charlie . " " Give him an AA , " Evers said , and Stackpole complied . There was a different set of blinks , and Stackpole sighed . " Now it 's Golf , " he said . " First Charlie , then Golf . It 's got to be a code . " To Grimond , Evers said , " You were expecting someone . Are these the people ? " Grimond said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell him to come in , " he said . " Send the same message Mr. Grimond sent to us . " " No ! " Grimond shouted . " Do n't do that ! " " I see no harm in it , " said Evers . Stackpole blinked the message , but there was no reply , and after a few moments he blinked it again . " I guess he'sp106gone , " he said , at last . " I probably bitched it up by not giving the right reply to his challenge . " Evers turned back to Grimond . " I 'm sorry if we interruptedsomething , " he said . " In the circumstances , we did n't have much choice . " Grimond shrugged . " It was nothing , " he said . " All that 's at stake is my life . " " What do you mean ? " " I joke . As you can see , they went away . " " Hey , Captain , " said Proxmeyer , from the darkness . " Look what I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's direction , and illuminated the tractor and wagon . " What 's in it ? " Evers asked . Before Proxmeyer could find out , Grimond said , " I will save you the trouble . It 's empty . " " The main thing we 're interested in is a radio , " Evers said . " Since you do n't have one , we 'd like to repair our boat engine . Can that be done ? " " That depends , " Grimond replied . " Nothing can be done tonight . " " I 'm aware of that . Above anything else we need food , and a place to lie down . Can you take care of us ? " There was a long silence , and then Grimond said , " How many are you ? " " Fifteen . " Another silence . " All right , " Grimond said , finally . " I do n't have fifteen beds , but you may lie on my verandah . I 'll do what I can . " He went to the tractor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on the lights . " Follow me , " he said , and drove slowly up the hill off the beach . The Icarus ' survivors followed in single file behind ,  |p107with  Evers in the lead and Stackpole immediately behind him with a flashlight , and Latch with the other flashlight bringing up the rear . Those in between stumbled through the darkness , joking and cursing and making small talk , some speculating on what they 'd interrupted on the beach , and others wondering how big the island was and how cooperativeits women were . Ensign Tuttle heard two men discussing the pros and cons of poontang , and he broke in on them . " There will be none of that , " he said , firmly . " Any man who molests a native woman will be put on report . " " Y'all do n't have to worry about that , Mr. Tuttle , " came the voice of Simmons , the Steward 's Mate . " That poontang do n't go for white meat nohow . Any Whitey go for a native girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How would you know ? " said Proxmeyer , behind him . " It 's an old native saying , " Simmons replied , cheerfully . " They say Whitey 's all right in his place , but you surer'n hell would n't want your sister to marry one . " Simmons tapped Jackson , who was just ahead of him . " What say , brother ? " he said . " Should we shop around among the local debutantes tomorrow ? " " I got work to do , " Jackson replied . " I got that engine to take down and clean . " From somewhere in the darkness came the high , plaintivebleating of a lamb . " Hey , " said Proxmeyer . " Listen . They got sheep . " " That 's right , " Simmons replied , as though he 'd planned it . " Debutantes for the brother , and sheep for Whitey . This is what they call Paradise Island . " " You 're feeling pretty feisty tonight , " Proxmeyer observed . " What 's got into you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you spend five days thinking you gon na wind up fish bait , it make you feel good to think you may get a piece of nooky instead . " Ahead they could see a lighted window in the darkness , and as they came closer , the low outline of a house loomed against the sky . Grimond stopped the tractor and dismounted , then led them up the steps to the verandah . " If you will wait here a moment , gentlemen , " he said , " I 'll get you some lights . " He went inside , closing the screen door firmly behind him , and the men milled about in the darknesson the verandah . Some sat on the steps , some stretched out full length and went to sleep , and the two with flashlights explored the area . Suddenly Stackpole said , " Captain , look here . " Evers went to where the Signalman was shining his light on the edge of a window screen . A covered wire emerged from the screen and connected to a porcelain insulator , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the problem ? " Evers asked . " That 's an aerial , " Stackpole said . " He said he did n't have a radio . " " He said he did n't have a transmitter , " Evers corrected him . " You do n't need a rig like that for a regular aerial . Besides , listen . " They were quiet , and Evers could hear the faint chug-chug of a diesel engine . " That 's a generator , " Stackpole said . " Why does he have kerosene lanterns if he 's got a generator ? " " A good question , " Evers replied . " I 'll see what he says . " Grimond appeared , carrying two lanterns , which he put on a rough oak table . " Now , gentlemen , " he said , " forp109food , I can offer you only  --  " He stopped , as he saw Stackpole'slight on the aerial . " Is something wrong ? " he asked . " We were just wondering , " Evers said . " This looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grimond coughed . " I did have a radio once , " he said . " But it broke , and nobody here can repair it . The natives are not experts at electronics . " " We were also wondering about the generator , " Evers said . " What 's that used for ? " " The  --  ? " Grimond seemed incredulous . " Listen to it , " Evers said . " That is a generator , is n't it ? " Grimond listened , and there was no mistaking the sound of the engine . His mouth opened , and after a moment he said , " Yes , I have one for emergencies , but I almost never  --  " As he spoke , the chugging of the engine slowed down and stopped , and there was silence . " I can not understand it , " he said . " I have n't used it in  --  I do n't remember how long . " " Is it all right if I have my men look at the radio ? " Evers asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grimond groped for something to say . " I do n't know , " he mumbled . " It has been so long  --  it must be rusted . " " Let 's look , anyway , " Evers said . " Andersen , you and Bogardus go in and see what you can do . " Andersen and Bogardus , the Electronics Technician , went into the house , and after a few moments Andersen reappeared . " There 's nothing the matter with the set , Captain , " he said . " It 's still warm  --  someone just quit using it . " " That is impossible ! " Grimond said , loudly . " I am the only one who ever uses that set ! "  | " You may think you are , " Andersen replied . Behind him , Bogardus appeared in the doorway . " That 's one hell of a set , " Bogardus said . " You could reach China on it . " Grimond began to breathe deeply . " I can not understand it , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Captain , look what I found , " came Ferguson 's voice from the darkness . He appeared at the foot of the verandah steps , holding a girl who struggled and squirmed and kicked and tried to bite him . " She was coming out of the generator shed , " he said . " She 's lucky I did n't shoot her . " " Emilie ! " said Grimond . " What are you doing here ? " " Make this Yankee son of a bitch let me go and I 'll tell you , " she replied , trying to kick backward into Ferguson 's groin . " Let her go , Mr. Ferguson , " Evers said , and Ferguson released her arms . She rubbed her wrists , and glared back at him . He grinned , and nudged her behind . " Mr. Ferguson ! " Evers shouted . " Yes , sir , " Ferguson replied , still grinning . " Emilie , what were you doing here ? " Grimond asked . " Were you using the radio ? " Emilie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . " You were n't supposed to be here , " she said . " That has nothing to do with it . Were you using the radio ? " " Yes . " " What for ? " She looked down at her bare feet , and traced a half circle in the dust with one toe . " This and that , " she muttered  | " Emilie , come here , " Grimond commanded , and she slowly came up the steps onto the verandah . Her dress was a plain cotton shift , and even in the dim light of the lanternsit was sharply obvious that she had nothing on underneath . Her skin was the color of cafe au lait , her hair was straight and glossy black , and her nose was broad at the nostrils . Her eyes , amazingly , were light blue . It was likely that her ancestry included three-quarters of the racialtypes in the Caribbean . " Man , " Simmons said , in a low voice , to Jackson . " You still think you gon na work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important , " Grimond said , when she stopped in front of him . " What were you using the radio for ? " " Music , " she replied . " Is that all ? " She nodded . " I gave you a portable radio . Why ca n't you use that ? " " I like this one better . " Grimond turned to Evers . " I do n't know what to say , " he said . " I do n't care what she was using it for , " Evers replied . " All I want is to get a message out . " " What kind of message ? " Evers hesitated . Since the code books were gone , the message would have to go in plain English , which meant he could n't identify his ship . But if he gave his name and file number , that would tell them in Washington , and the rest could be deduced . The unidentified submarine , which had been the most important thing to report , could now be anywhere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and his crew back in friendly handsp112without revealing where they 'd been or what they 'd been doing . The Latins were touchy enough , without being given the added irritation of knowing they were being spied upon . " The message is simple , " Evers said . " I 'd like to be rescued . If I can get through to Panama , they 'll send a seaplaneor a ship , and take us off . What 's the name of this island ? " " Santo Gato , " Grimond replied . " Unless you have a very big chart , you wo n't find it . " " They 'll have the charts . Can you give me the coordi-nates ? " Grimond made elaborate geographic double-talk while his mind ran over the choices open to him . If he was the true revolutionary he pretended to be , he 'd do everything to hinder these people . On the other hand , the last thing he wanted was to have them staying on his island , where they made his own operations impossible , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as he could . But there was a third factor , which was the Cubans ' threat to kill him if the operation failed , and the operation had certainly failed as of now . So it would help if these people stayed here , like bodyguards , because the Cubans would n't try anything while they were around . It all boiled down to the same uneasy question : Which side was going to win out in the end ? The more he thought about it , the more absurd it seemed to side with a haphazard group of guerrillas against the United States Navy , so his best move was to cooperate . " I can tell you precisely , " he said , at last . " Come with me , and I 'll show you a chart . " " Hey , what about the chow ? " came a voice from thep113dark end of the verandah . " I 'm gon na die if I do n't get something to eat . " " Pardon , " Grimond said . " I forgot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread . However , there is wine , which should help a little . " " Hot damn , " said the voice . " Let 's get at it . " Grimond led the way into the kitchen , followed by the shoving , laughing , bearded men . Their clothes were shredded and stained with oil and salt water , the exposed parts of their skin were alternately mahogany brown and bright red , with patches of blisters and peeling tissue , and their lips were raw and cracked . Some had reasonably heavy beards , while others sprouted only patchy stubble . Taken as a whole , they looked like the mob scene at the Bastille . It was the first time he 'd seen them in full light , and it made him wonder if these men really belonged to a civilized navy . But he saw the " US " on Ferguson 's pistol holster and knew it was not an imitation . He put the food on the kitchen table , then went to a cupboard and took out four slim-necked , dusty bottles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he produced a corkscrew , " but I think they will suffice . " He opened the bottles and passed them around , and while he was looking for glasses , the men proceeded to drink out of the bottles , each one swallowing as much as he could in one breath . Grimond looked at them , shrugged , and put the glasses back . Evers made himself a mutton-and-cheese sandwich , and when Grimond returned , he said , " You were going to show me the chart . I 'd like to get this message off as soon as possible . " " Ah , yes , " Grimond replied . " Follow me . " Taking ap114lantern , he led the way into an adjoining room , which had heavy wood beams and plaster walls and smelled of earth , like a cellar . From a drawer he took a yellowed , rolled-up chart , which crackled as he opened it on the top of the table . He weighted the four corners with conch shells , and then pointed to a small spot off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Here we are . " Evers peered at the chart , and noticed that two or three spots were circled , with faint pencil lines running toward them and compass courses marked along the lines , and he guessed that these were the places Grimond landed his whatever-it-was . " All I need is the latitude and longitude , " he said . " Do you have dividers ? " Grimond produced a rusty pair of dividers and a pencil and paper , and Evers wrote down the coordinates of the island . Then he tried to word his message so as to give enough information without giving away too much , and finally , after several tries , penciled out FIFTEEN SURVIVORS SANTO GATO ISLAND II 42 20 N 69 I8 30 W HAROLD EVERS 234564 . The Communications boys would pass it along to Intelligence , who , unless their title was a gross misnomer , would look him up in the Navy Register and deduce what had happened . From the kitchen came noises indicating the wine was having its effect . Voices were raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash of a bottle dropped on the tile floor . Evers and Grimond went in and were confronted with a jumble of glassy-eyed figures , their teeth showing white through their beards and their faces wearing the expressions of dancers in a lunatic asylum . They were n't all drunk , but the impression was one of mass drunkenness ;  |p115one  or two had gone to sleep on the floor , another was staring into a broken bottle , and two were embracing and singing into each other 's face . They had found more wine , and spilled a lot of it on themselves and the floor , but they seemed oblivious to everything except the euphoria that enveloped them like a cloud . Ensign Tuttle was leaning against a wall smiling at nothing , and only Ferguson seemed absolutely sober . His face was impassive , and he did no more than glance around when Evers came in . " All right ! " Evers said , raising his voice above the noise . " Knock it off ! That 'll be enough for tonight ! " The men quieted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Clean up the mess here , and hit the sack . Mr. Grimond did not invite you in to destroy his house . Andersen , you 're excused from clean-up . I want you to work the radio . " " Aye , sir , " said Andersen . He came forward a trifle unsteadily , but his eyes and voice were clear . He was trying hard to look sober , and almost succeeding . " Are you in shape to operate that set ? " Evers asked . " Yes , sir , " Andersen replied , drawing himself up . " I can operate any sonofabitching set made . " " All right . I guess 2182 is the best channel . If you ca n't raise anything on that  --  " " Captain , sir , this is no voice set , " Andersen cut in . " This has a key . This is a real , no kidding , go-to-hell trans-mitter . " " Oh , " said Evers , with a glance at Grimond . " So much the better . Uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start up the generator . " " Yes , sir , " Grimond replied . " Immediately . " He left , and Evers handed the message to Andersen . " See if youp116can get that through to Panama , " he said . " Give it an Urgentheading , and break in on another transmission only if you have to . " " Aye , sir , " said Andersen , taking the message . He went into the other room , and Ferguson came beside Evers . " I do n't trust that Frog , " Ferguson said . " I do n't trust him an inch . " " Why not ? " " He lied to us about the radio . He lied himself black in the face , and all the time that little piece of poontang was sending out messages . I 'll bet you anything she got off a message about us . " " What makes you think so ? And to whom would she send it ? " Ferguson smiled . " Captain , do n't be naive , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hooks on us here . We 'd be sitting ducks . All we 've got to protect us is this . " He patted his holster , and went on , " That 's why I always wear a gun at GQ  --  you never know what 's going to happen . " " I still do n't see any evidence , " Evers said . " All you 're going on is suspicion . " " Suspicion and some damned good circumstantial evi-dence . " " So what would you propose to do ? " " Nothing , right now . I 'm just going to keep an eye on Monsoor Grimond , and make sure he does n't try to knife us . " As an afterthought , he said , " And that little broad , too . She 'd make nice looking after , but of a different kind . " " I think you 're seeing things , " said Evers . " Captain , I saw them . " Ferguson laughed , and gesturedp117with his hands . " Right beneath that thin little dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See you do n't shout back , " Evers replied , quietly , and Ferguson laughed again and left the room . Under Ensign Tuttle 's fuddled direction , the men went about cleaning the kitchen . They picked up the larger pieces of broken glass and dropped them in the garbage can , and Simmons found a mop , which he stabbed at the stains on the floor . Tuttle tried to wake Bromley and Latch , who were sleeping where they 'd fallen , but as soon as he woke one and turned to the other , the first one went back to sleep again . He finally dragged them to a corner , propped them in a sitting position leaning against each other , and looked around for a bucket of water . " Leave them there , " Evers told him . " It wo n't do any good to wake them . " " But , sir , this is an all-hands operation , " Tuttle protested . " And all hands means all hands , which these are not . " He knew the sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct it , so settled on an earnest frown . " Look at it this way , " Evers said . " Even if you got them both awake , they 'd be no good to you , so you might as well let ' em sleep . " " Aye , aye , sir , " Tuttle replied , and looked for something else to do . Proxmeyer , a broken bottle in one hand and a crust of bread in the other , came unsteadily to Evers and peered at him as though looking through a dirty window . " Captain , may I tell you something ? " he said . " Of course , " said Evers.  | " When you first came aboard , " Proxmeyer said , speakingslowly and with a great attempt at clarity , " I thought you were a prime shit-heel . A prime , A-Number-One shitheel . Now I think you 're a great guy . " " Thank you , " said Evers . " Think nothing of it , " Proxmeyer said , waving the stump of the bottle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , but a great guy nevertheless . " " That 's nice to know , " said Evers . " Whaddaya mean he is n't as great as Gantring ? " said Bogardus , who had been trying to pick cheese crumbs from the floor . " What was so fucking great about Gan-tring ? " Proxmeyer regarded Bogardus with scorn . " You know fucking well what was so fucking great about Gantring , " he said . " Just because he gave you a fucking deck court  --  " " All right , " Evers cut in . " Let 's not go into that now . Let 's get this place cleaned up , and hit the sack . " Bogardus and Proxmeyer glared at each other in silence for a moment , then Bogardus said , " Do n't let him shit you , Captain . You 're better than Gantring ever thought of being . " Proxmeyer dropped his bottle and bread . " How would you like your fucking nose pushed down your  --  " " I said knock it off ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men faced each other , breathing deeply , and then they both turned away and went back to what they 'd been doing . Lamb , the Quartermaster , came up behind Evers and touched him on the elbow . Evers turned , and Lamb whis/pered , " I think you 're doing a splendid job , " and scurried off , bumping into a chair as he went . Gradually , as the euphoria wore off and the bone-deep fatigue began to take over , the men slowed down in their work , and Evers could see they were on the verge of dropping to the floor . He was about to tell them to leave the rest until morning , when there came a scuffling of feet behind him and Ferguson appeared , holding Grimond by one arm . He shoved Grimond forward , and said , " All right  --  tell the Captain what you tried to tell me . " Grimond 's face was pale , and he twisted his hands in front of him and said , " The generator is gone . " " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Somebody cut the fuel line . The fuel is gone  --  all over the ground . " " Somebody my ass , " said Ferguson . " He cut it . I saw the ax . " " Please , " Evers said . " Let him tell me . " Then , to Grimond , " Who would have cut it ? " Grimond 's shoulders rose . " Who knows ? " he said . " Perhaps Emilie  --  but I do n't know why . " " I do , " said Ferguson . " She 's  --  " " Mr. Ferguson , please ! " Evers waved Ferguson back , and said to Grimond , " Can it be repaired ? " " With a new piece of line , " Grimond replied . " But there is no more fuel . " " You mean no more anywhere ? " " Perhaps someone on the island has some . I do n't know . " " Where does yours come from ? " There was a slight pause before Grimond said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perhaps two weeks , perhaps a month . " " Look , Captain , " Ferguson put in . " This son of a bitch is sabotaging us right and left . If you want my advice , I think we ought to tie him up . " Evers looked at Grimond , whose eyes had lost their focus . He seemed resigned to whatever might happen . " I do n't think that 'll be necessary , " he said . " But , Captain , we could all be murdered in our sleep ! " Evers took a deep breath , and let it out slowly . " That 's a chance we 'll have to take , " he said . " We can not repay a man 's hospitality by tying him up in his own house . " He saw incredulity in Ferguson 's face , and went on , " I 'll stand watch the first part of the night . As long as somebody 's awake , I do n't think he 'll try anything . " " There is nothing I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a murderer , although I can not expect you to believe it . " " I believe it , " said Evers , and then , to Ferguson , " See that the men get bedded down . I 'll stay up with Mr. Grimond , and perhaps we can think of something to do . " Ferguson rolled his eyes upward . " Now I 've heard everything , " he said . " I do n't think you have , " said Evers . " I told you to get the men bedded down . See that you do it . " Ferguson rounded up the men and distributed them in various sleeping places , some on the verandah , some in chairs , and some on the floor . They were so stunned , both with fatigue and with wine , that they moved as though under water , slowly and dreamily and with a sort of driftingmotion . They sank down in silence , and what had been a high-decibel bacchanale subsided into a gentle chorus ofp121hiccups , snores , and sighs . One man rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " and then fell heavily back . Evers and Grimond looked at each other . " Alors , Commandant , " said Grimond . " Will it be permitted for me to retire ? " " By all means , " Evers replied . " You turn in , and I 'll  --  sort of look around . " Grimond hesitated , started to say something , then thought for a moment and shrugged . " As you wish , " he said . " But I do n't think you will find anything very interesting . Without the generator , this is a very primitive place . " " And with the generator ? " Evers asked . " It is still primitive . I live the life of a  --  how you say ?  --  abbe  --  cure  --  monk  --  celibate . " " Yes , so I noticed . What does she do around here , any-way ? " " Emilie ? This and that . " He smiled . " A girl of all work . " Evers laughed . " It 's none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in is my men . " " In that case , Commandant , I shall wish you good night . You have nothing to fear . " " Good night , Mr. Grimond . Sleep well . " Evers watched Grimond go into the bedroom , and then he walked down and off the verandah and looked at the sky . The moon was not yet up , and the stars seemed as large and as close as leaves on a tree , and Evers tried to visualize a God behind them to whom he could pray . If ever I needed outside help , I need it now , he thought . My first trip in command , andp122already I 've lost almost three-quarters of my crew . It was n't my fault , but it was my responsibility , which comes to the same thing . He tried to look past the stars , to draw some power or wisdom from the glittering infinity above him , but all he could hear was his own voice . He did n't speak aloud , but his thoughts seemed audible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a murderer . Sixty-two men have died because of what you did , and how are you going to make it up to them ? You 're not . You ca n't . You might as well have lined them up and shot them , and when you 've done that , there 's no making up . All you can do is keep anything worse from happening  --  keep the men that are left to you safe and unharmed , and get them back where they belong . How ? A good question . Hope . Pray . But prayer wo n't walk them across the water , so it 's got to be something more concrete . Something you do yourself . And what are you going to do ? Wait and see ? Hope for the best ? That 's some sterling commanding officer you turned out to be . Why did the Navy give you command ? Because they thought you could do it . And did you ? You bet you did . Sixty-two dead men will testify to that . They 'll be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer you are . A real , grade-A schmuck , that 's what . You should have turned down the orders when you had the chance . You should have told the Bureau you were n't fit to command , and you 'd rather be assigned to . . . " His thoughts stopped , and he stared mutely at the sky , appalled that anyone , even to himself , could be so groveling and full of self-pity . " I beg your pardon , God , " he said , out loud . " I was hoping you 'd feel sorry for me . I apologize . " He stared in silence at the void beyond the stars , and heard not ap123whisper of reply . " All right , " he said , at last . " If we 're through crying in our beer , perhaps we can get on with the job . " He circled the darkened house , noticing the outbuildings and the generator shed , and he wondered idly what form of chicanery Grimond was up to . Some sort of smuggling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the customsregulations of the area followed no set pattern , and for every necessity there was somewhere a law against importingit . It made life brisk and profitable for the smugglers , and did nobody any real harm . The last thing he had to worry about was how Grimond made his living . Whateverit was was Grimond 's business , and knowing about it might only complicate matters . He had completed his tour of the buildings when he heard a faint crunch , and he stopped and listened . It had come from the path to the beach , and although it was n't repeated , he had the definite sensation that someone was watching him . He edged quietly toward a bush and waited , and whoever was watching him also waited , and what seemed like several minutes passed while Evers strained his ears and stared at the darkness . His imagination gave forms to the shadows in the underbrush , and they flitted and changed and assumed a variety of shapes , but nothing materialized and nothing really moved . He could hear the gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea , but the crunch was not repeated and he began to think he 'd been mistaken . Finally , he said " Hello ? " and was answered by silence . He stepped away from the bush and said , " If there 's anything I can do for you , just speak up , " and as he started to walk toward the path , there was a sudden scrabbling noise , and a figure darted out of the foli/age and raced toward the beach . Evers started to follow , but he had taken only a few steps when he stopped . Do n't be a bloody idiot , he told himself . You 're supposed to keep out of trouble , not get into it . Whoever it was wants no part of you , so keep it that way and do n't interfere where you 're not invited . He heard the cough of a boat engine starting , and then a faint fluttering noise that gradually died away , and he went back to the house and sat on the steps of the verandah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , and he leaned back against the steps and looked at the sky . Shepherd , mind your flock , he thought . If you ca n't be a hero , at least do n't be a fool . The stars had a hypnotic effect on him , and he thought he was still looking at them even after his eyes had closed and he had fallen into a deep sleep.  |p125As  SHE RAN DOWN THE HILL toward the settlement , Emilie began to wonder if she 'd done right to cut the fuel line . It had been instinctive , to prevent the Yankees from sending their message , but now she realized she 'd incapacitated the set for herself as well . All the training she 'd received on how to start the generator , tune the set , and send out a coded message was wasted if she did n't have a set to send on . They 'd probably fix it sooner or later , but in the meantimeshe 'd have to rely on other means to get her messages out . It had been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters that stood for certain situations or sentences , so all she had to do was send a single letter to get her messagep126across . She 'd been able to report on everything Grimond did  --  everything that was of interest to the Cubans  --  and she 'd been in a position to warn them if he ever seemed to be wavering . She did n't know if he was wavering now , but he was in the hands of louts who rendered him completely useless to the Revolution . This was intelligence that had to be sent out ; the question was how . An idea occurred to her , and she veered off the path and headed for the Jolly Roger Tavern . As she came close , she heard the sounds of shouts and thumps and crashes , and then the swinging doors flapped open and a body came hurtling out . Emilie stood by and waited until another figurespun through the doors , and then a third , which was followed by Ralph Matsuma , with his head down in a buttingposition like a goat . Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , ran his hand across his head and said , " Next time , please to remember this is gentlemen'sestablishment . " He turned and started back inside , then saw Emilie . " Good evening , girl , " he said . " May I see you a moment ? " Emilie asked . " Professional or social ? " Ralph replied . Emilie paused , then said , " A little of each . " " I take no professional calls here , " Ralph said , and turned for the doorway . " Please , " said Emilie . " This is n't really professional . This is more advice . " " Then come in , " said Ralph , going through the swinging doors . " Have a seat , and I be with you on the minute . " Emilie went inside and sat in a corner booth while Ralph swept up the debris of the fracas . He clucked and muttered as he worked , regarding each broken bottle and overturned chair as a separate personal insult , and he tookp127out his anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , when the floor shone and the furniture was once again in place , he put away the mop and drew up a chair . He turned it around and sat on it backward , his arms crossed over the back and his chin resting on one fist . " Now , " he said . " Tell me . " " Mister Paul has trouble , " Emilie said . " Mister Paul always has trouble . What kind now ? " " He has been captured by a gang of Yankees . " When he was surprised , Ralph 's eyes did n't widen ; they went half closed . He looked at her through lowered lids and said , " Explain , please . " Choosing her words carefully , Emilie said , " This evening he went down to the beach , and this gang of Yankees came out of the sea and captured him . They want to use his radio to send messages . " " You say they came out of the sea , " Ralph said . " Did they have boat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How were they dressed ? " " Like pigs . Their clothes were torn and dirty , and they all had beards . One of them has a gun . A big , tall son of a bitch , who I am going to kill . " Ralph thought for a moment . " Is it possible they were wrecked in a ship ? " he asked . " I suppose so . One of them said he wanted to get a message to Panama , so they could be rescued . " Ralph clucked his tongue . " In what way did they captureMister Paul ? " " In what way ? " said Emilie , her voice rising . " They are fifteen and have a gun , and he is one and has nothing . He must do anything they say ! "  |p128Ral|ph  put a thumbnail against his front teeth . " And what do you want me to do ? " " When do you next leave the island ? " " That depends . " " Will you go to Santa Melissa ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you go to Santa Melissa , I would like you to give a message to Rodney Manchos . Do you know him ? " " I treat his cousin for the kidney stone . A good man . He screams very softly . " " Then tell Rodney Manchos that Mister Paul is held captive by fifteen Yankees who have one gun . A pistol . Tell him that . " " And what is he to do ? " " He will know . " Ralph put his hands on his knees , as though to rise . " Is that all ? " " One more thing . " Emilie sucked her lower lip for a moment , then said , " How can I make a person come to me ? " Ralph 's eyes flickered . " In what way ? " " Come to where I live . " " Why ? " " This Yankee son of a bitch named Ferguson thinks he is very special with women . He thinks he can take anyone he wants . I want him to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own will , and while he is doing it I want to cut off his zobbes . " Ralph made a clicking noise . " I would not advise that , " he said . " That is not professional . If you want him sterile , take the root of the  --  " " I do n't want to do it by long distance . I want to do itp129while he thinks he 's supreme . I want to hear him scream . " " He might kill you , girl . " " Not the way I do it , he wo n't . " Ralph looked up at the imitation grape arbor . " I am not sure I should be involved , " he said . " The ethics are very strict about this sort of thing . " " All you have to do is tell me how to get him to come . Beyond that , you are not involved . " Ralph continued to look at the grape arbor , and Emilie went on , " I have a very nice portable transistor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips . " Still looking upward , Ralph said , " Take the left foot of the chicken , better the young one . With the middle claw draw three lines in the dirt before your house , three feet apart at first and all coming to a point in your door . If it does not work in twenty-four hours , try with the right foot of another chicken . This time a black one . If after twenty-four hours that has not worked , let me know . " " Thank you , " said Emilie , rising . " And thank you for your time . " " My time is my living . Do not forget the radio . " " Let 's wait and see how the charm works , " Emilie said , as she headed for the door . " I went through a lot to get that radio . " " As you wish , " said Ralph . " I have other charms , for people who back out on agreements . " " I 'll bring it by tomorrow , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the night . Ralph stared at the door for a while , then got up and went into the kitchen . He lighted a lantern , lifted a trap door in the floor , and went down a ladder into the root cellar , closing the trap door over his head . The root cellar ,  |p130by  the light of the lantern , looked like a grotto deep in a mountain . Its boundaries were moving shadows , its contentstook various shapes with the changing light , and the only solid thing about it was the dirt floor , which was cool and soft on his bare feet . Around the perimeter were jars and barrels and tins and boxes , in which he kept roots , seeds , flour , spices , dried objects both animal and vegetable , and all the other staples of both his trades . He had root of mandrake and tongue of bat , dried skate 's wing and pickled onions , chicken feathers and powdered ram 's horn , and , in a special jar that once held yellow cling peaches , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what had been a quart gin bottle he had a collection of the hottest peppers on the island , moldering quietly in vinegar to make a sauce two drops of which would ignite the blandest soup . There were few problems , either gastronomic or demoniac , that could n't find their solution in this cellar . Ralph set his lantern on a battered wooden table in the center of the area , and for a few minutes was lost in thought . A group curse was one of the hardest feats of obeah to effect , but even if it was only partly successful , it would be better than nothing , and Grimond clearly needed all the help he could get . Matters were further complicated by the fact that Ralph did n't know any of the invaders personally , and the curse would therefore have to be in the most general of terms  --  a stop-gap action , and no more . He reached into a sagging burlap bag , withdrew a handful of white beans , and placed fifteen beans on the table , one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others back into the bag and dusted his hands , then with a chicken feather pushed the beans around until they formed a rough circle . In the center of this circle he placed thep131white and brittle jawbone of a rat , and he set it on an axis that pointed in the direction of Grimond 's house , where he presumed the men were staying . Then from a shelf he took a bottle that had once held Angostura bitters , but having been emptied and sterilized now contained the powdered beaks of octopus , and very carefully he held this bottle over the flame of the lantern , and with his forefinger tapped out a trickle of the powder . It crackled and burned in bright blue sparks , while Ralph muttered a guttural chant taught him by his grandmother . Then he capped the bottle , replaced it on the shelf , and once again dusted his hands . He listened as the sound of footsteps approached overhead , then quickly he scooped up the beans and returnedthem to the sack , replaced the chicken feather in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes seemed to glow like fireflies . The footsteps went first into the kitchen and then circled through the other rooms ; there came the scraping sound of a chair being pulled out , and a creak as the visitor sat down . Ralph waited , but it was apparent the visitor was determined to wait too , so after a few minutes he took the lantern and went up through the trap door and into the kitchen . He looked into the dining area , and saw the same man who had been asking for Grimond a few days before . His beard was black and grew in tight , kinky curls , and the trousers of his olive-green fatigues were wet from the knees down . Ralph was interested to note that he was carrying a revolver , badly concealed beneath his shirt . " Good evening , " Ralph said . " What may I do for you ? " The man regarded him balefully for a moment , then said , " Who is at Grimond 's house ? " " I do n't know , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear . "  | " What do you hear ? " " I hear he captured by Yankees . Fifteen Yankee men from a boat . " The man thought for a moment and then grinned , showinga line of jagged teeth . " Were they shipwrecked ? " " That is possible . " The man seemed to know more than he was saying , and it flicked Ralph 's curiosity . " Why ? Do you know of a shipwreck ? " " One was arranged recently , " the man replied , still grinning . " How ? " " Put it this way . The Yankees want to know more than is good for them . Sometimes they see things that make them curious , and they have accidents . They run into mines , and things like that . " Ralph clucked his tongue . " You arranged that ? " " I did not say that . " The man stopped grinning , and looked at the ceiling . " Are they armed ? " " I hear one man has a pistol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the man teetered back and forth in his chair , and then he set the legs down and stood up . " Thank you , corn padre , " he said , and the swingingdoors flapped behind him as he went out.  |p133EVERS  WAS LEANING crookedly against the steps , in the same position in which he 'd sat down , when he awoke and saw that the stars were still bright and the moon was hangingoverhead . His back and neck ached , and he stood up and glanced at the prostrate men around him . They looked for some reason like sleeping children ; in a sense they were his children , and he felt an odd twinge of parental affection . I wish Alice and I had had kids , he thought . Maybe if we had . . . Well , the hell with that . Nothing 's going to change any of that now . He stretched to ease the cramp in his muscles , then made a slow tour of the house and outbuildings . There was no sound other than his own footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but inaudible . The island seemed as lifeless as the moon above it , and after assuring himself there was nothing further he could do , he went up onto the verandah , and wedged himself in a corner by the door . His five days under the sun had made him groggy ; his eyelids felt like sashweights , and in less than a minute he was asleep again . He was so far under that Ferguson 's voice came to him as part of a dream . Then he felt his shoulder being shaken , and he opened his eyes in daylight and saw Ferguson standing over him with a submachine gun in his hands . Evers struggled upright as Ferguson 's voice came into focus saying , " What do you think of this ? " " What is it ? " Evers said , trying to stand up . " Where 'd you get it ? " " I got it in the building next door . It was in a crate with fifty others . What it is is a Czech machine gun . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet fully awake . " You mean you stole it ? " " What I mean , Captain , " Ferguson said , with elaborate patience , " is that this guy is dealing in Commie weapons . In other words , he 's one of Castro 's boys . It 's a good thing I found it when I did . " " What does he say ? " Evers asked . " Where is he ? " " He 's right here . " Ferguson nodded at the other end of the verandah , where Grimond was being held by Proxmeyerand Bogardus . " There is n't a hell of a lot he can say . " Evers looked at Grimond , who was pale and nervous . " Is this true ? " Evers asked . Grimond made a shrugging gesture with his head . " Youp135can see for yourself , " he replied . " I can not change the markings on the guns . " " That 's what we broke up last night , " Ferguson said . " This guy is running guns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered the chart , and the lines leading to the mainland . He looked at Grimond for confirmation , and Grimond said nothing . " I think we ought to shoot him , " Ferguson said . " A guy like this , there 's no telling what he 's going to do . " " We 're not going to shoot him yet , " Evers replied . " We have enough problems already , without adding that . " " It 'll be no problem , I promise you . One squirt from this gun , and we 'll have one less problem . " " Is there ammunition , too ? " " The works . All new , packed in grease , and ready togo  --  " Evers looked at Grimond again , and Grimond looked back at him without expression . All right , Evers thought . I guess now is the time to stop being a good guy . " Tie him up , " he said . Proxmeyer went off to look for some rope , and Bogardus continued to hold Grimond . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He is n't going to try anything right now . " Cautiously , Bogardus released his grip , and Grimondrelaxed . Evers turned to Ferguson . " Where are the rest of the men ? " he asked . " Some are still sacked out , and some are off trying to scrounge up breakfast . This place is short on chow . " Fergusonkept his eyes on Grimond , and fingered the trigger of the submachine gun . " Round them up as soon as you can . Have them here inp136a half hour , and we 'll set up working parties . The first thing we 've got to do is get that generator fixed . " " Yes , sir , " said Ferguson . He went into the living room and shouted , " Up ! Everybody up ! On your feet ! Muster on the verandah in half an hour ! " There were groans and mutterings , and someone said , " Oh , Jesus , " and Ferguson could be heard going through the house and into the back yard . Evers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , " he said . " But I do n't see I have any choice . " " You are making a mistake , " Grimond replied . " But I suppose that 's only natural . " " What would you do in my place ? " " I 'd try to be a little more civilized . " " I 'm not mistaken about what you 're doing , am I ? " " No . " " Then there 's nothing else I can do . " Proxmeyer came back with a length of clothesline , and started to truss Grimond up like a turkey . " You do n't have to be all that elaborate , " Evers said . " All I want is to keep him from getting away . " " Captain , I do n't know no other way to do it , " Proxmeyerreplied , as he looped the line around Grimond 's neck . " If I make it any looser , he 'll be able to untie the knots . " He brought the line down behind Grimond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his ankles . He stood back , and surveyed his work . " There , " he said . " He wo n't be going nowhere for a while . " Grimond looked like a caricature of a prisoner , and it made Evers feel foolish . But he did n't know what else to do , and once having given the order , he could n't very wellp137rescind it . He might be able to modify the lash-up later on , but for the moment it would have to stand . He found himselfunable to look Grimond in the eye . Gradually , the men began to drift onto the verandah , some yawning , some scratching , and some munching on bits of food . Looking at them , Evers thought that the first order of business ought to be to get them shaved and as presentable as possible , but with only Grimond 's razor to work with , it would waste too much time . Every hour they stayed on the island increased their chance of being discovered , and , above everything else , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled , Evers said , " All right , now . There are three things we need , and I 'll list them in the order of their importance . First off , we need diesel oil , to get that generator started . Next , and just about as important , we need whatever tools are necessary for Jacksonto repair that line  --  and , incidentally , our own boat engine . After that , we could use some food . I 'm sure Mr. Grimond will be happy not to have us eating him out of house and home . " They all looked at Grimond , who was glowering silently in his corner , and Evers went on , " Mr. Grimond , do you know offhand where we might find some diesel oil ? " " No , " said Grimond . " Very well , then , we 'll just have to look . Mr. Tuttle , you take two men with you , and Mr. Ferguson , you take two , and you cover the island until you 've found some . I guess there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , Mr. Grimond ? " " On an island , everything is waterfront , " Grimond replied  | " So it is . Well , Mr. Ferguson , you look for any docks or places where there might be boats , and Mr. Tuttle , you take your men and look around the island itself . There may be diesel tractors , or other generators , that have storagetanks . We do n't need much , but we 're nowhere without it . Also , we 'll need three men to stay here and guard our boat . We do n't want the natives stripping it behind our backs . Now , Jackson , what tools are you going to need ? " " I do n't know for sure , Captain , " Jackson replied . " Maybe I can bind that line , but I think I 'm gon na need a new piece of tubing . Then a Stillson wrench and screwdriver , and things like that . I 'll want some kerosene , for soaking the boat carb. "  --  Very well . You and Simmons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it clear you 're borrowing it  --  I do n't want people to have the impression we 're loot-ing.  --  " Suppose they want to be paid ? " Ensign Tuttle put in . " Can we give them chits ? " " Tell them we 'll pay them as soon as we can , " Evers replied . " But within reason . Do n't let them hold you up just because the Navy 's paying the bill . " " I have a feeling they wo n't argue , " Ferguson said , smiling . " Perhaps not . Now , about food . Bogardus , you and Proxmeyer and  --  uh  --  Latch , you look around and see what you can find . There may be crops , or fruit  --  Mr. Grimond , is there anything grown on this island that 's edible ? " " That depends on what you call edible , " Grimond said . " Well , see what you can find . If there are stores , givethem a receipt for anything you take , and the same goesp139for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying around that 's obviously public property , so much the better . If there 's a fish or meat market , find out how we can contract to draw on them while we 're here . " He looked around , and said , " I guess that 's all . Are there any ques-tions ? " Ferguson raised his hand . " Captain , " he said , " do n't you think we ought to have guns ? " " Why ? " said Evers . " We do n't know how these people think . We do n't know whose side they 're on . After all , if this joker is working for Castro , it 's possible the rest of ' em are . I do n't think we ought to go unarmed into what might be a booby trap . We 're splitting into small groups , and we could be ambushedas easy as not . " " I suppose that 's true , " said Evers . " All right , then , one man in each group take a machine gun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those we borrow ? " Ferguson said , and the men laughed . " What Castro does n't know does n't hurt him , " Evers replied . " All right , pick out your details . " Ensign Tuttle looked at the men . " Andersen , you and Lamb come with me , " he said . " Lamb 's in my detail , " said Ferguson . " You take someoneelse . " " How come ? " Tuttle replied . " I asked for him first . " " That 's tough . Take someone else . " " Like hell I will . I asked first , so he comes with me . " " Listen sonny boy  --  " " Knock it off ! " Evers cut in . " Mr. Ferguson , do you have some particular reason for wanting Lamb ? " " He 's in my division , " Ferguson replied  | " Navigation has nothing to do with this problem . Since Mr. Tuttle asked for him first , I suggest he go with Mr. Tuttle . " " Since when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop worrying about rank , and get on with the job . Lamb goes with Mr. Tuttle . " Ferguson 's face turned red , and he looked at the other men . " All right , " he said . " Bromley and Stackpole . " Evers glanced at Lamb , who was unable to suppress a smile . Their eyes met , and Lamb 's face went blank . I 'd like to know what that 's all about , Evers thought , but it 's not likely I 'll be told . In his corner Grimond listened quietly to the altercation , and began to have second thoughts about where his allegiance lay . This is the most fouled-up crew I 've ever seen , he thought . They 're bound to get into trouble , and as long as I 'm with them their trouble is mine . Better to get them the hell off the island and take my chances with the boys from the Revolution . If I 'm left tied up like this , it 'll be obvious there was n't much I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Captain , may I make a sug-gestion ? " They all turned and looked at him , and Evers said , " Of course . " " I have a boat , " Grimond said . " If you were to  --  ahliberateit , as the phrase used to go , you could be on the mainland in a little more than two hours . " " Would it hold us all ? " Evers asked . " It would be crowded , but you could make it . " " That 's a great idea , " Ferguson said . " Then you callp141Castro 's boys in with their planes , and we 're caught at sea in an open boat . Some fun . " Grimond regarded him coldly . " I was addressing your Captain , " he said . " I assume it is he who makes the deci-sions . " " Just getting to the mainland would n't do us any good , " Evers said . " We 've got to get to where we can send a mes-sage . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That would take longer . " " And in an overloaded boat , " Evers said . " I think we 're better off staying here for now . " " You know we are , " said Ferguson . " Unless we shoot this joker when we leave . " " That wo n't be necessary , " Evers said . " All right , now . I 'll stay here and keep an eye on Mr. Grimond , and the rest of you shove off . Report back when you find any-thing . " The men divided up as instructed , and as they trooped off the verandah , Ferguson said , " Fall to at the storehouse for guns and ammunition ! Each group will have two extra clips ! " Wearily , Evers turned and looked at Grimond . The two men regarded each other in silence , and then Grimond said , " You 're making a terrible mistake . " " So you said , " Evers replied . " What 's the civilized way of doing it ? " " What you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men loose on the island ! And under a man like that Ferguson  --  " Grimond rolled his eyes upward , and blew out his cheeks.  | " They 're not all like Ferguson , " Evers replied . " He 's only in charge of one group . Tuttle 's all right , and so is Jackson . I do n't think there 'll be any trouble . I hope there wo n't . " " Better do more than hope . Better you should pray . " " Look , Mr. Grimond , the decision has been made . There 's nothing I can do about it now , so there 's no point hashing it over . " " There is a lot you can do about it now . You can stop them from passing out the guns . " " And have them think I 'm taking orders from you ? Re-ally . " " Let them think what they want . Just keep them from getting the guns . " Evers felt rising irritation . " Mr. Grimond , " he said , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 've been trained by the United States Navy , they know how to handle weapons , and they 've been instructed to be as tactful as possible with the natives . They 're not going to roar around like a bunch of drunken cowboys . " " A gun is used for two things only  --  to kill , and to threaten to kill . In either case , no good can come . " " It can also be used for defense . To keep trouble from happening . " " That word defense ' covers everything including murder . " " I 'm not here to argue semantics with you . There 's a job we have to do , and I 'm going to see that it 's done the best and the quickest way possible . Now , I 'm hungry and I 'm dirty and I need a shave . Do you have any facilities I could use ? "  | " I would be glad to show you if I were able to move . In the circumstances , you will have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here . " Evers got up , and approached Grimond and said , " If I untie you , will you give me your word you wo n't try to escape ? " " Yes . " " All right . " Evers undid the lashings , and coiled the rope and put it down . " I think the shower should be first , " he said . " Do you have such a thing ? " " Out under the water tank . There is a faucet , and some soap . I 'll get you a towel , and start water for your shave . " " Thank you . Once I look human again , I may be able to think better . " " In that case , we will all benefit . " Evers laughed . " You do n't have to worry . Everything 's going to be all right . " " Of that I am sure . But for whom remains to be seen . " As he stood under the tepid , dribbling shower from the water tank , Evers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The light was bright and clear and blue , and a brisk wind blew in from the sea and made the metal vanes on the windmill rattle as they spun around . The earth near the buildings was baked hard and dry by the sun , but farther away the grass and vegetation were abundant . Out of curiosityhe looked to see if there were any fruit trees , but they were all strange to him , and unidentifiable . Some looked like pictures he 'd seen of trees in Africa , flat on top as though drawn with horizontal strokes of a pencil , and there was one tree with long , paddle-like leaves that clacked and rattled in the wind . There was what looked like cactus , and other tropical growths , and there were palm trees  --  thep144only ones he could identify  --  and he got the feeling that somehow the men could find enough food to keep from starving . From far off he heard the bleating of sheep . We 'll be all right here , he told himself . So long as nobody does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . He was still irritated by Grimond 's lecturing him about guns , and he liked to think his men were well enough indoctrinated not to be trigger-happy . Ferguson was a problem , but Ferguson was always a problem , and nothing anyone could do was going to change that . Trying to plan ahead about Ferguson was like trying to plan ahead about a thunderstorm , so there was no point wasting time about it . Also , in spite of his faults Ferguson was efficient in certainareas , and once he decided to get a thing done , you could be sure it was going to be done . His methods were n't always the best  --  he was an advocate of the **47;11042;TOOLONG of thought  --  but one way or another he usually got results . I guess I 'd better be thankful for small favors , Evers thought . So long as there 's anything good to be said for him , I 'm that much ahead . When Evers , his lean and bony hips wrapped in a towel , got back inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water into a basin . Then he produced a razor and shaving soap , and while Evers hacked away at his week-old beard , Grimond looked through the remains of last night 's banquet to see if anything edible was left . He came up with a lump of cheese and a torn crust of bread , and he was opening a bottle of wine when Evers said , " If that 's for me , no , thanks . " " Why not ? " Grimond replied . " As you saw last night , it is perfectly potable . " " I know , and I do n't want it to hit me. "  | " This is wine , Commandant , this is not cognac . " " True . But as you said , we will all benefit if I am able to think better . That 's why they do n't have wine in the Navy . " " In what Navy ? " Grimond was incredulous . " The United States Navy . Americans , as you saw last night , are not prone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had had no food . " " I know . Nevertheless , aboard ship there are no alcoholic beverages . " " But you are not aboard ship . " Grimond spoke in a tone one would use arguing with a child . " You are here . On the dry land . " " The fact remains , I would just as soon not have any wine . " Grimond looked at the bottle as though it were a daughterwho 'd been insulted . " I do n't understand , " he said . " Have I offended you in some way ? " " Not in the least . " " I know . It was about your men and the guns . I did n't mean it was only Americans who should not carry guns ; I meant everybody . I had a Commandant once who not only should not have had guns , he should not have had a ship . To him , the fact that he had a ship made him right in everything he did . He would shoot his torpedoes when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his to say . It 's the same when a man has a gun . " " What kind of ship were you on ? " Evers asked . " A submarine . It was a long time ago , but the facts are the same . A man with a gun , or a torpedo , or a bomb , has the last word , and this makes him think he 's right . When in fact he is wrong , this is very dangerous . Now , I did notp146mean that your men are wrong ; I only meant it was a dangeroussituation . " " I see . " " If I offended you , I apologize . " He held out the bottle . " Now , would you join me in a glass of wine ? " Rather than prolong the argument , Evers accepted , and Grimond poured out two glasses . He raised one , said , " Salut , " and threw the contents down his throat . " Cheers , " Evers replied , still shaving . " I 'll join you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you have ? " Grimond asked , pouring himself more wine . " Where were you ship-wrecked ? " Evers hesitated . He 'd been expecting this kind of questionand had hoped to be able to fend it off with doubletalk , but he 'd have to be careful . " We hit a mine , " he said . " There were two of them , to the east of here . They 'd broken loose , and were floating . Do you know who 'd be planting mines in this area ? " " Who can tell ? " replied Grimond . " If they were floating , they could come from anywhere . " " I suppose so . Well , that 's what did us in . We were investigatingsome flares , when blam . " " Did you lose many men ? " " I 'm afraid so . So far as I know , we 're the only sur-vivors . " " Out of how many ? " Again , Evers hesitated . " About eighty . " " Oh , merde . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , then . " " Fairly small . " " Were you one of those intelligence ships ? The thingsp147they call spy ships ? " Grimond seemed delighted at the idea . " No , no , " Evers said quickly . " We were more a  --  patrol craft . " Grimond beamed . " Imagine ! " he said . " I am host to the crew of an intelligence ship ! Does that mean you are all of superior intelligence ? " Evers glanced at him to see if he was joking , then rinsed the razor and shook it dry . " You can judge for yourself about that , " he said . " There are times when I think we 're all morons or savages . " " Americans amaze me , " Grimond said . " Here you are running the world , and all you really worry about is whether people like you . You should accept the fact that the one who runs the world is despised by all the rest , and get on with your business . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it did n't worry them for an instant . They ran a large empire exactly as they chose , and they spat in everybody else 's eye . Now , I 'm told , they are much nicer . " " How about when the French ran the world ? " Evers asked , drying his face . " That was different . That was a long time ago , when everyone was a salaud . The French were just better salauds than the rest . " " They 're doing pretty well now . " " Do not judge by De Gaulle . It might astound him to hear it , but he is not France . " " That 's nice to know . " Evers bobbed his wine glass , and took a sip . It tasted warm and velvety . " Look at De Gaulle as an instance , " Grimond said , re/filling his own glass . " He is the creme de la creme des salauds , but does it worry him ? Does he say to Madame De Gaulle , Maman , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me ? ' He does not ! He goes right ahead , la grande asperge , and does things that make even French people despise him . That , mon Commandant , is true greatness . You Americans could take a lesson . " " I 'm not so sure , " Evers replied . " I see nothing to be gained by being a bastard intentionally . Be one if you have to , but do n't set out to be one . " " And do n't worry if you are one . That is what I mean . You Americans are bastards incessantly , and idiots frequently , and all you do is worry about it . " " We 're a young country . When we get as old as France , maybe we wo n't worry about it , either . " If you get as old as France . A man can look so hard at his navel that he does n't see the building falling on him . " " Well , we ought to set a good example , " Evers said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it did to him . " To whom ? " Grimond said . " Who would follow ? " " I phrased it badly . Put it this way  --  I think you should be dignified in everything you do . I do n't mean pompous dignity , I mean simple dignity . It 's undignified to be a lout , and it 's undignified to lose your temper . As a country we 've made incredible progress technically , but we still do n't know about people . The way we treat Negroes is undignifiedto the point of savagery . We 're undignified in everything  --  in our politics , our business , and our home life . Even our religion is undignified ; I once went to a Christmas Eve service where the clergy did an ecclesiasti/cal snake dance around the collection tray . The American way of life is based on money and fornication , neither of which is the slightest bit dignified . " " There you go , apologizing again . " " I 'm not apologizing , I 'm simply stating facts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Because I feel it 's dignified to serve . There 's a dignity in doing the best you can , for very little reward . " Evers paused , and added , " Also , I did n't like it on the outside . " Grimond looked out the window . " I agree with you about money being undignified , " he said . " But fornication  --  that , after all , is the very act of creation . There 's a certaindignity there , frantic though it may sometimes be . " He sighed , and added , " It 's a relief to be French . " " Why ? " ? " The French do n't worry about generalities . They worry only about the matter of the moment . " " Meaning what ? " Grimond 's shoulders rose . " Anything . An insult  --  a woman  --  a political crise  --  " There came a short burst of machine-gun fire from the distance , and both men looked at each other . " What was that ? " Evers asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a window and looked out , but all they saw was the sun-baked landscape . They went out on the verandahand saw nothing more , and when they listened all they could hear was the clatter of the windmill and the threshingof the wind in the trees , and then the far-off bleating of sheep . " I told you , Commandant , " Grimond said . " No good can come . "  | " We do n't know it 's bad . " Evers was trying to convince himself , and was n't succeeding . " It can not be anything but bad . Nobody on this island is armed . They would be insane to resist your men . Somebodyis shooting unnecessarily . " " Either that , or they 're in trouble . " " From whom ? " " I guess I 'd better find out . " Evers clapped his hands to his hips , then realized he had n't worn his pistol . He looked around . " I suppose I ought to have a gun of some sort , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Be my guest , " said Grimond , with a cold smile . " Take your pick from the storehouse . The more the merrier . " " This is just to be safe , " Evers replied , tartly . " I do n't intend to use it . " " In that case , why take it ? " Evers glowered at him , and went out to the storeroom . He had a panicky feeling that things were beginning to slip from his control , and he wanted to regain command before they got completely out of hand . Grimond was probably right ; it was a mistake to turn armed men loose the way he had , and the only thing he could do now was try to round them up before they did any more damage  --  or got into any more trouble  --  than they already had . What he should have done , now that he thought about it , was to have remained in charge himself , and led one single expedition in person . That way , he could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he picked up a machine gun from its crate , all we can do is hope it 's not too late . He found a rag and wiped the gun clean , then inserted ai clip into the magazine and went out into the sunlight.  |p151From  the main house , Grimond watched him through a window . Allons , enf ants de la patrie , Grimond said to himself . Le jour de gloire est arrive . Et merde trois fois pour le monde.  |p152BORN  AS HE WAS near Verdun , Paul Grimond had no intention of ever joining the Army . Although he was brought up to regard Verdun as the symbol of heroic resistance , he had seen evidence , here and there , of what that resistance cost . Aside from the military cemeteries , which stretched like fields of wheat across the countryside , he had also seen the more personal reminders , such as shattered and rusting bits of equipment , and every now and then a leg bone , or part of a skull . Each spring , when the first plowing broke open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would crop up , and occasionally a farmer would be killed when the blade of his plow hit an unexploded shell , Paul finally had the feeling he was living over one vast charnelhouse ,  |p153from  which the spirits came up with the night mists . He wanted no part of such carryings-on , and when the time came for his military service , he enlisted in the Navy . This disappointed his father , a doctor who , although he had lost a leg in the First World War , was so befuddled by nostalgia  --  andthe cognac in his breakfast coffee  --  that he looked back on the Army with affection . At first young Grimond felt self-conscious with the red pompom bouncing atop his sailor 's hat , but he quickly learned the sailor 's trick of wearing the absurdities of the uniform with arrogance , defying anyone to make fun of him . This was precisely what the authorities wanted , and he did well in his basic training . Fired up with elan , he volunteered for the submarine service , and after additional training and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the outbreak of war in 1939 , to the pride of the French Navy , a submarine so large it was officially referred to as an underwater cruiser . It was about a hundred meters long , it carried two eight-inch guns in its turret forward , it had ten torpedo tubes , and  --  unheard of in any submarine in any navy  --  it carried a scouting airplane in a special hangar on the after deck . The men on this ship knew they were in the biggest and best of its kind in the world , and their spirit was accordingly arrogant . The only trouble was they had nobody to fight . During the winter of the so-called phony war they cruised about , looking for German ships to sink , but the Germans ' plans were land-oriented , as became painfully obvious the followingspring . With the fall of France , Grimond 's ship headed out into the Atlantic , carrying gold bullion from the Bank of France and determined to carry on the war alone . They crossed to the French base at Martinique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then they set out on a war patrol . The klaxon for Babouillard , or General Quarters , blew him out of his hammock early the next morning . He was a torpedoman , with his battle station at the Number Three bow tube directly beneath where he slept , and thus he was automatically going through the motions of preparing the tube before he was fully awake . Gradually it began to dawn on him that this was no drill , and he looked at the other torpedomen around him , all of whom were coming to the same realization . The main question was where were they , and what was it they were about to attack ? They could n't be far from Martinique , but were they in the Atlanticor the Caribbean , and had they spotted a Boche surfaceraider or a submarine ? It might even be a pocket battleship , like the Scharnhorst or the Gneisenau , but it was unlikely that the Boche would bring a battleship this close to shore . More likely it was a surface raider . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prepare to meet thy doom . The order came to open the outer torpedo doors , and everybody held his breath . After what seemed like an eternity of waiting , the order " Ready One " came through the voice tube , and the boy on the Number One tube became tense , his hand on the firing mechanism and his eyes staring straight ahead . " Fire One " came through , and he squeezed his hand and the boat shuddered as the torpedo hurtled into the water . There followed " Ready Two , " and " Fire Two , " and another shudder , and Grimond grasped the brass firing mechanism on his tube with a sweaty hand , and waited . There was no furtherorder . Then , very faintly , there was a thud , and after a moment a second thud , and they shouted and cheered ,  |p155and  called the Boche all sorts of names , and they pounded the backs of the Number One and Two torpedomen . France was n't through yet , you could be sure of that . Renaud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peut pas mourir . " As soon as they secured from General Quarters , the torpedocrew hurried back to see what they 'd hit , but nobody seemed to know . They asked the men in the control room who simply shrugged , and they asked the Quartermaster who 'd stood by the periscope with the stop-watch , and he said nobody had told him . They just called it " Target , " he said . But it was on the surface , which meant it was probably a raider . The trouble was that nobody knew for sure . They did n't dare ask the Captain , and the other officers were n't talking , although the expression on the Exec 's face said more than words . He was in a white-lipped fury , which made them wonder if they 'd missed a chance for a better target , or what . But everybody had heard the hits , which meant that something had gone down , and that was certainly an improvement over what had been happening before . They came to General Quarters again early that evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see his target with a minimum chance of being seen himself . This time Grimond got to fire his tube , but either his or the Number Four torpedo missed the mark , and there was a long wait while they wondered what was going to happen next . The crew who manned the eightinchguns were hoping they might have a chance at some action , but in the end the order came through to fire the Number Five torpedo , and this resulted in a hit . This time there was no question about their target ; it had been a merchantman loaded with some buoyant cargop156that had kept it from sinking after the first torpedo hit , and the delay was over the decision of whether or not to finish it off by gunfire . To the disgust of the gun crew , a torpedo had been used , but none of this explained what everybody was wondering : What were Boche merchantmen doing this close to the coast ? They must be coming from Argentina , which was known to be friendly to the Nazis , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Atlantic , instead of creeping into the midst of the Allied naval patrols ? The Americans were n't actually in the war , but they were cooperating with the British , and would certainly tip them off to any German trade routes . Maybe they were Italian ships and simply did n't know any better , which seemed the most logical answer . The thought that they were sinking Italians instead of Germans was like shooting rabbits when you were out for lions , but the revenge was nevertheless satisfying . They went under this assumption for several days , until the incredible word spread through the mess that what they were sinking were Allied ships . Nobody would have believedit had not Tufferd , the mess attendant assigned to the Captain 's cabin , heard the Captain and the Exec in a violent argument . As he recounted it , he 'd brought a tray of liqueurs to the cabin following dinner , and had been about to knock when he heard the Exec say , " This is insane , and it 's barbarous . Better to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ espece de con , " the Captain replied . " He fights for the British . Do you want to fight for the British again ? Do you want to have them run out just when you need them the most ? That 's what they 've done , and that 's whatp157they 'll do every time you give them the chance . I say merde to the British . " " But these are n't only British , " the Exec protested " They 're American , and they 're Dutch , and  --  my God , some of them may even be French ! How can you justify sinking Frenchmen ? " " In the first place , I do n't know that any of them have been French , " the Captain replied . " In all probability , they have not . In the second place , there are no personalities in a periscope . What I see between the crosshairs is a target , and it could be Hitler or it could be De Gaulle or it could be my mother , but that would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No more , no less . You have the bearingon the target , and you estimate its range and course and speed , and you make a plot of where it will be when your torpedo gets there , and you send your torpedo to that spot . There 's nothing more to it . Who it may be is no concernof mine . " " You mean you 'd shoot up anyone ? Anything that happened to come along ? " " In these waters , yes . " " In these waters . Suppose we were in the North Sea  --  would you go after the Scharnhorst , or the Graf Spee ? " " Montreux , you 're an idiot . " " I do n't see why . What 's the difference ? By your definitionthey 'd be targets , too . " " One very large difference . The Germans are going to win this war . You saw what they did ; they ca n't be stopped . Very shortly they will have beaten the British salauds , and then Hitler can do what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans if they 're stupidp158enough to get involved , and then who 's to stop him ? The Hottentots ? The Esquimeaux ? Try to think a little , before you become emotional . And the more we do to help , the sooner the whole silly mess will be over . " " Suppose he does n't win the war  --  what then ? " The Captain made a noise with his mouth . " Suppose my grandmother had balls . Then she 'd be my grandfather , but she is n't . Montreux , when reality comes right up to you and spits in your eye , you have to face up to it . " There was a silence , and then the Exec said , " What are you going to tell the crew ? They 're beginning to wonder what 's going on . " " I 'll tell the crew what they need to know , and no more . I 'll tell them to go to battle stations when I command it , and any man who refuses will be shot as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one man serve as an ex-ample . " Tufferd , who acted out both parts as he told the story , concluded by imitating a man in front of a firing squad , and then sat down . If the subject had been any different , there 'd have been applause , because Tufferd was an accomplishedmimic and could parody all the officers with savage accuracy , but this time there was silence . The men stared at the mess table until finally someone said , " Of course , he 's right . " " Who 's right ? " said Grimond , who was feeling sick in his stomach . " The Old Man . You have to face reality , and make the best of it . " " Merde dents ! " Grimond shouted . " Who is he to tell us what 's reality ? He does n't know any more than the rest of us ! "  | " Calm down , co pain , " another man said . " Keep on like that , and you 'll be the one he shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Grimond . " Just let him try once , and I 'll break his pig 's back . " There was an awkward silence , and the first man said , " That 's not funny . " " I did n't intend it should be , " said Grimond . " This is n't a time for laughing . " One of the junior petty officers got up from the table . " Take it easy , " he said to Grimond , and walked away . Grimond took it easy in that he did n't argue any more , but his joy and pride in the service were gone . He went about his duties automatically , hoping that the Number Three tube would n't be called on to fire , and when it was , and he had to squeeze the brass firing mechanism , he said , " Dieu vous benisse , " under his breath as he sent the torpedoaway . There came an evening when his torpedo hit a tanker and set it on fire . The Captain brought the sub to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flames roar up into the night , and they saw burning oil spread out across the water and engulf the tanker 's lifeboat and the men who were trying to swim away . They could see the men splashing water , trying to keep the oil away from them , and then one by one they disappeared . The heat from the fire warmed the sides of the submarine 's conning tower , and the Captain remarked that if they stayed around much longer they 'd have to use sun-tan lotion . Grimond began to vomit , and when the submarine submerged , he went to the crew 's head and spent the night retching . The next time they put into Martinique to refuel , Grimondcarefully packed his clothes , rolling each item tightlyp160as he 'd had been taught in boot camp , and put them into his sea bag . If he 'd been thinking rationally , he would n't have tried to take anything with him , but his rage had made him irrational . His only thought was to get off the ship , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Chief Torpedoman , a barrel-chested Breton with skin the color of oak , came into the compartment . " Where do you think you 're going ? " he asked . Grimond pulled the cords on his sea bag , swung it over his shoulder , and started for the door . " Out of my way , " he said . The Chief put one hand on Grimond 's chest , and pushed him gently back . " What the hell 's got into you ? " he said . " I said , out of my way , " Grimond replied , starting forwardagain . This time , the Chief pushed him hard , making him drop his sea bag . " Femme de chambre d'une vache , " he said . " Do you want to get yourself shot ? " Grimond leaped at him and started to swing , and the Chief hit him on the side of the head with a blow that sent him spinning onto the breech of a torpedo tube . Then the Chief picked him up , pinned his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of him through the compartmentsand passageways to the Exec 's cabin . The Exec was at his desk , writing , and he looked up in surprise as the Chief pushed Grimond into the room . " Pardon me , sir , " the Chief said . " We have a casualty here . " The Exec studied Grimond 's white face and glassy eyes , and said , " What 's the matter ? "  | " He 's sick , sir , " the Chief said . " He 's gone off his rocker . " The Exec turned around so as to face Grimond squarely . " In what way ? " " He tried to  --  " the Chief started , but Grimond cut him off . " I just want to get off this God-damned boat , " he said . " I want nothing more to do with it . " " You see what I mean , sir ? " the Chief said . " He tried to slug me . He 's got to be crazy . " " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calmly . " Why ? " said Grimond , his voice rising to a shriek . " Why ? Why do you think ? Do you think this is any place for a sane man ? You 're the ones who 're crazy , not me ! " The Exec took a deep breath . " Grimond , this is wartime , " he said . " And in wartime one does things one would never do otherwise . Certain rules have to be obeyed  --  " " Fuck the rules ! " Grimond shouted . " And fuck you and fuck the whole Navy ! I want to get out ! " The Exec looked at the Chief . " I see what you mean , " he said . Then , to Grimond , " I tell you what . I 'll have you transferred to the hospital , but there 's one condition , and that is  --  " " I do n't want your hospital and I do n't want your conditions , " Grimond cut in . " I just want to get out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess it would n't work anyway , " he said . " We might get him certified insane , but even then . . . " His voice drifted off , and he thought for a few moments and then said , to the Chief , " Take him back to his quarters . I 'll talk to the Captain , and see what he says . "  | " Yes , sir , " replied the Chief . " You want me to slap him in irons ? " The Exec smiled thinly . " I do n't think that will be nec-essary . " " Then put a guard on the door ? " The Chief seemed disappointed . " Not even that . Just tell the gangway watch he 's not to be allowed ashore . " " But , sir , " the Chief protested , " he tried to  --  " " The main trouble we have here , " said the Exec , " is that this man is not really crazy . Now , take him back to his quarters . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid son of a bitch , " he said . " He was trying to help you . " " Ha , " said Grimond . " And now you know what 'll happen ? " The Chief 's tone seemed an odd combination of pain and pleasure . " They 're going to shoot you , that 's what 'll happen . He 's going to ask the Old Man , and the Old Man 'll say , Good ! He 's just the example I 'm looking for ! Next time we 're at sea , we 'll stand him up on the fantail and shoot him . ' Right off into the water . Or maybe he 'll keel-haul you . You know what keel-hauling is ? They pass a line under the ship and across the deck , and they tie your hands to one end and your feet to the other , and then , very slowly , they drag you down and around  --  " " You bore me , " said Grimond . " You Breton peasants have no imagination . " The Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him forward . " I do n't take that from anyone , " he said . " Especially someone who 's about to be shark meat . "  | " What I become is no concern of yours , " Grimond replied , and then , after a moment 's thought , " Thank God . " The Chief shoved him into the forward compartment and then left , saying , " If you know what 's good for you , you 'll stay there . " That 's an odd line of reasoning , Grimond thought , as he unlashed his hammock to lie down . That 's like telling a rabbit to hold still while you get a gun . It 's the reasoning of the typical Breton fisherman . They 've hauled nets for so many centuries their minds have grown gills . He got into his hammock and lay staring at the overhead , wondering what to do next . He did n't think he 'd be shot , in spite of what the Captain had said , but he 'd almost rather be shot than go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later the Allies were going to wake up to what was happening , and send out an anti-submarine task force to get them , and that would be the end . Better die trying to escapethan be crushed by depth charges , or suffocate slowly while the sub lay crippled on the bottom . He was mulling over the bleak possibilities when Lascombe , the boy on the Number One tube , came into the compartment . " You ought to go up and get some air , " Lascombe said . " It smells as sweet as a woman . " " How would you know what a woman smells like ? " Grimond replied . Lascombe looked at him . " What 's the matter with you ? " he asked . " Nothing , " said Grimond . " Other than the fact that I 'm probably going to be shot . " He filled Lascombe in on his problem , and Lascombe whistled . " Boy , " he said . " You do have your ass in a steam kettle , do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , as an idea began to take form . " How ? Shoot the Captain ? " " Your tube 's empty , is n't it ? " " Yes . " " All right . Open her up and I 'll climb in , then you lock the breech and open the outer door , and I 'll swim out . You can flush the water out later . " " Man , you 're crazy . You 'll drown sure as hell . " " It 'll be no worse than staying here . If I 've got to go some way , I might as well go trying to escape . " " What 'll that do to me ? They 'll know I helped you , and the Old Man 'll shoot me instead of you . If you do n't mind , I say the hell with that . " " You can say you never saw me . Say I was gone when you got down here . Nobody 'll know the difference . " Lascombe looked unhappy . " Suppose they see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they 'll know I helped you , because you ca n't do it alone . " " Nobody 's going to see me . It 's night , and I 'm not going to come up waving a flag . Besides , the guys are n't going to be looking down in the water ; they 're going to be looking for girls on the beach , and you know it . Now , come on , I have n't got all night . " " I 'm too young to be shot , " Lascombe said , plaintively . " Sure as hell they 're going to find out about it , and they 're going to shoot me . " " Oh , shut up and help , " said Grimond . " Nobody 's going to know anything if you keep your mouth shut . " He opened the breech of the tube , and peered into the darkly shining interior . " All right , " he said . " Here goes . " He bentp165down , put his arms above his head , and wormed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet were inside . " O.K. , " he said , in a muffled voice . " Close her up . " " The reason I joined the submarines was I do n't like guns , " Lascombe whined . " I ca n't stand the noise . I like a nice , quiet submarine , with no explosions and no gunfire , and now what 's going to happen ? They 're going to put a handkerchief over my eyes , and tie me to a stake , and then all those guns are going to go off  --  " The rest of the sentence was lost to Grimond as the breech closed , and he was left in darkness . His heart was pounding , and he breathed deeply , to get as much air in his lungs as possible , and then there was a swish and a roar and the inrushing water slammed him back against the breech . He held his breath and kicked and paddled until he reached the outer rim of the tube , and then pulled himself out and , with his ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface . In the compartment , Lascombe had just finished flushingthe water from the empty tube when the Chief came in . " Where 's Grimond ? " the Chief demanded . Lascombe 's throat closed , and he could barely speak . " In the head , " he croaked . " God damn it , I told him to stay here ! " The Chief turned and ran to the crew 's head , and when Grimond was n't there he began to race up and down the passageways , shouting Grimond 's name . Finally , and more calmly , he went to the Exec 's cabin and knocked on the door . He came to attention as the Exec looked up . " Mr. Montreux , sir , " he said . " Grimond 's escaped . " " How could he ? " the Exec asked  | " I do n't know , sir . I left him in his quarters  --  without a guard , as you instructed  --  and went to notify the gangway watch . When I got back , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , sir . Not quite . " " Search the entire ship , and if you do n't find him notify the police on the base . But make sure he is n't aboard before you bother them . " " Yes , sir . " When the Chief had left , the Exec stared at the bulkheadfor a long time , then shrugged and went back to his writing . With the leeway thus afforded him , Grimond was able to get clear of the base before the alarm was sent out . He spent three months living among the island natives , but his sense of duty and his conscience finally prodded him into leaving . The United States had entered the war , and he made his way north and presented himself to the authoritiesfor whatever use they could make of him . They put him in the O.S.S. and parachuted him into France as a member of the underground , where he worked for two years before being caught by the Nazis . They did n't kill him because they hoped he might lead them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insensibility . During the long period of his recuperation his mind kept going back to Martinique and the natives with whom he had lived , and the area took on a mystic , Avalon-like quality . His recoverywas due , in part , to his determination to return there after the war.  |p167WHEN  EVERS STARTED OFF across the island , he had no clear idea where he was going . The shots he 'd heard had come from a submachine gun , which seemed to eliminate Ferguson and his .45 , but he could n't think who among the others would have started shooting . Ferguson had gone toward the docks , and the others had fanned out in different directions , which left him with a toss-up as to which path to take . He slung the gun over his shoulder , squinted his eyes against the glare , and headed toward the middle of the island . When in doubt take the median path , he told himself , and wished he could think of something more positive . The heat had a searing , baking quality which was bearableonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would have been suffocating , but as it was , Eversp168simply felt he was getting dryer and more brittle every minute and would shortly begin to crackle . Even the smells in the air were hot  --  the smell of baked earth and hot green leaves and glittering rocks  --  and they seemed to register in his lungs as though printed there with each breath . He was too dehydrated to perspire , and he was reminded of the corpse of a praying mantis he 'd once seen , which disintegratedwhen he blew on it . He took a stony path that led through the underbrush . Small lizards flicked out of his way , vanishing almost beforehe could see them , but aside from them and the occasionalbleating of sheep , there were no signs of animal life . Maybe we 'll have to fish for our food , he thought  --  or maybe , if we 're lucky , we 'll get away before food becomes a problem . At the moment food is secondary to getting the generator started , so that 's what we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a perfect parallel to the " for lack of a nail " situation ; for lack of a small piece of fuel line and a couple of quarts of diesel oil , fifteen men were stranded on an island where , if their presence became known , the very least that would happen would be acute national embarrassment , and possibly a great deal worse . He wondered what other parallels there were , where else in history events had turned on something so trivial , and he could picture the mortification of the PT skipper he 'd heard of who 'd had to report that his torpedoes malfunctionedin battle because the maintenance crew had mixed the torpedo alcohol with grapefruit juice . No wonder so many captains chose to go down with their ships , he thought . Drowning would be a pleasure , compared to facingan icy-eyed bank of Admirals at a Court of Investigation . He remembered how close he 'd come to going downp169with the Icarus and wondered if he was better off now . He came over a slight rise and , far in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane and beyond that the sea that rimmed the island . There were no animals or people visible , and no signs of habitation , so he veered to his right and cut farther inland , circling back toward the dock area and the cluster of houses that constituted the settlement . The underbrush was thicker and the trees higher , and although he could n't see much , he was at least going back to where people were , and hopefully an explanationof the shots . He found himself wondering if he 'd really heard them and thinking perhaps he had n't , but he knew that both he and Grimond had heard them , and nothing could be mistaken for what they 'd heard . No backfires , no tractors , no boats , no machinery , and no other guns made precisely that kind of noise . It was a stutter , too fast for an automatic pistol and not loud enough for a regular machine gun ; the sound had a round , ball-like quality , different from the flat , pointed crack of a rifle shot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He came to a clearing , at the far end of which was a large , spreading tree , resembling a cross between an elm and a horse chestnut . The leaves were flat , almost like lily pads , and the cover they formed was so thick that it was a few moments before Evers realized someone was standing at the foot of the tree . He stopped , and tried to blend into the bushes while he watched what the man was doing . He was an old , wizened native , and he gasped with pain and rage as he feebly tried to hammer a nail into the trunk . He was using a stone as a hammer , and the nail bent and skidded and kept falling out , but finally he managed to get it to stay in , after which he tore a leaf from an overhangingp170branch and pressed it to his chest . He sat down , coughing and moaning , and then was quiet . Very slowly Evers walked toward the man , who remainedhunched over until Evers was a few yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes widened in terror , and he jumped up , still holding the leaf to his chest . " No ! " he shouted , and backed away . " Get out of here ! Pirate bastard ! " " Take it easy , " Evers said , gently . " I 'm not going to hurt you . " " You say you not  --  you like other pirate bastards ! Thiefs ! Son of bitches ! " The man 's eyes were puddles of red and brown and black with no white showing , and the cords in his neck were like rubber bands . There were no teeth in his gaping mouth , but it expressed rage as clearly as though he were baring the fangs of a wolf . His whole body trembled , and his arms , which held the leaf against him , were quivering and fluttering like a bat 's wings . " Listen to me , " Evers said , spreading his hands . " I do n't know what you 're talking about . Who are the pirates , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hoped it would n't be confirmed . " Three pirates ! " the man shouted . " Like you ! They steal my chickens , and they stab me with a gun ! They break my bones , the son of bitches no-good bastard pi-rates ! " Oh , God , Evers thought . It must have been Ferguson . " How were they dressed ? " he asked . " Like you ! With the gun like that ! " He pointed at the gun slung on Evers ' shoulder . " Two son of bitches take my chickens , and one son of bitch stab me with gun ! "  |p171So  it was n't Ferguson , Evers realized . Ferguson would probably have shot him , and besides , he had a .45 . " They were instructed not to take anything by force , " he said . " They were told to give a note for all goods received . Did they do that ? " " They do nothing ! They take my chickens , and they break my bones ! " He coughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his chest . Evers was quiet for a moment . " Is it all right to ask what that leaf is about ? " he asked . " Is it a bandage , or what ? " The man glared at him , panting , and then said , " None of you goddam business . " " All right . I only asked . " He looked at the tree , and saw that the trunk bristled with nails , some new and some old , and the ground surrounding it was littered with rusty nails . " I gather a lot of people come here , " he said . " It must be a popular place . " The man said nothing , and Evers went on , " What 's the system ? You put in a nail and take off a leaf , is that it ? " The man remained mute , and Evers asked , " What does the leaf do ? " " For pain , " the man replied , at last . " When you have the pain you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it go . " " So this is called the pain tree ? " Evers looked at it again , hoping to identify it , and saw that it also bore nuts the size of almonds . " How about the nuts ? " he asked . " What do they do ? " " For the obeah man . Anyone else take them , his guts shrivel up and his feet fall off . " " It 's a sort of magic ? " " Obeah no magic . Obeah he obeah. "  | " Sorry . " Evers thought for a moment , and an idea began to take form . " Am I right  --  you put a nail in the tree in exchange for a leaf ? " The man nodded , and Evers went on . " All right , then . My men took your chickens  --  I 'm sorry they hurt you , and I 'll find out who 's responsible  --  andin exchange for your chickens I 'm going to give you something , just the way you give a nail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man . I have plenty nail . " " I did n't say I 'd give you nails . I 'll give you a chit  --  " " The other man say that , too . I no need that  --  I get plenty from chickens . " " Excuse me . A chit is a receipt  --  a piece of paper , promising to pay . " " Pay what ? " " Pay for the chickens . " Evers began to have the feeling he was going crazy . " To pay you money for the chickens that were taken from you . United States currency  --  paid by the Navy . " " What United States currency ? " " Money . Silver . You can buy things with it . " " Can you eat it , like chickens ? " " No , but you can buy more chickens with it . You can buy chickens until they 're coming out your ears . " The man considered this . " I like my own chickens back , " he said . " The hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep breath . " What I give you will be as good as chickens , " he said . " It will be even better , because you can get other things with it , too . " " Show it me , man . Let me see . " " I do n't  --  ah  --  have it right now . Have you a piece of paper ? "  | " You crazy ? Where I keep paper ? " Evers looked at the man , whose only clothes were a shredded pair of dungarees and an undershirt that looked as though it had been resurrected from a peat bog , and he realized the inanity of his question . " How about at home ? " he asked . " Do you have paper where you live ? " The man glowered at him . " I have nothing at home , " he said . " Goddam pirate bastards take everything I have . " " I thought they only took your chickens . " " All I have is chickens . " Evers looked at the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to say next . He reached out , touched one of the almond-shaped nuts , and started to twist it off , but the man stopped him . " Hey ! " he shouted . " You want your guts shrivel and your feet fall off ? " " Sorry , " Evers said , snatching his hand back . " I forgot . " He paused , then added , " Look . Let 's go back to your house . There must be something there I can write on , and I 'll see that you 're reimbursed in full . " " What the hell that mean ? " " I ca n't explain it better than I have . You 'll see . You wo n't lose . " " I already lose . " " Look , Sam , " Evers said , wearily , " life is a series of losses and gains . Next week you may have so many chickensyou 'll forget all about those you lost today  --  and , incidentally , how many did they take ? How big was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man tensed , as though ready to jump . " Your flock  --  herd  --  how many chickens did you have ? "  |p174Without  a flicker of hesitation , the man said , " Fifty . Maybe sixty . " Evers stared at him . " Three men took fifty chickens ? " " Sixty . Maybe seventy . " " How ? " " Tie them up . Carry them away . Pirate bastards . " " I find that hard to believe . " The brown in the man 's eyes changed to red . " You goddampirate bastard too ! " he shouted . " You all the same , man ! You thiefs ! No-good , goddam  --  " " All right ! All right ! All right ! I 'll make it out for whatever you say ! Let 's stop the bickering and get it over with ! " Evers found he was shouting to drown out the older man 's voice , and he stopped and , more quietly , said , " Will you take me to your home ? " The man hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest , and finally he turned away and , without a word , headed down the path . Evers started to follow him , then returned to the tree , wrenched a nut off and put it in his pocket , and hurried to catch up with the shuffling figure ahead of him . The man 's home consisted of a one-room tarpaper shack , with a chicken house behind it and a fenced-in area between . The ground was littered with feathers , and the roost was empty ; it was clear that all the chickens were gone , but Evers had strong doubts that there had ever been , at the outside , more than two dozen . It occurred to him that he could write pretty much what he wanted on the chit and the man would never know the difference ; the main thing was to keep up an appearance of legality , and avoid any more ill-will than was absolutely necessary . Whether it was Tuttle 's or Bogardus ' group that took thep175chickens he did n't know , but when he found out , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush-up course in civilian relations . The man entered the shack ahead of him , and when Evers followed , he was assailed by a smell that was almost tangible . It clotted his throat and lungs and made his eyes sting , and he reeled gasping back into the daylight and breathed deeply to clear his senses . He could see the man pottering about inside , and he called in and said , " Is it all right if I sign it out here ? I get a kind of  --  ah  --  asthma in small spaces . " " There is no paper out there , " the man replied . " The only paper is here . " " I know , but ca n't you bring it out ? I can write it better in the sunlight . " Evers groped in his shirt pocket , and found the stub of the pencil he 'd used the night before . " See ? " he said , holding it up . " I 'm all set to go . " " In here , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Christ , Evers thought . All right , if I have to . He took three deep breaths and then ducked through the doorway , hoping to be able to hold his breath until he 'd written out the chit . The man indicated a crate that served as a table , and a box for Evers to sit on , and as his eyes became accustomed to the gloom , Evers realized there was no paper in sight . He half turned , and was dust in time to see the man 's eyes , white now in the darkness , bulge with the effort of swinging a large object , which hit the side of Evers ' skull with a ringing crash , and Evers toppled sidewaysoff the box . He vaguely felt the gun being taken from his shoulder , and then the sound of gongs and rushing water blotted out everything else.  |p176LIEUTENANT  GEORGE A. FERGUSON had n't had so much fun since the day he was thrown out of Yale . Here he was , leading a detachment of armed men on a strange island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to take it by force if anyone resisted . He had decided that both Bromley and Stackpole should have machineguns , and they , plus himself and his .45 , made a formidablelittle fighting unit . They could certainly handle any opposition that might crop up on this island , so for the time being they were supreme . It was a heady feeling , and he reveled in it . His expulsion from the ivied halls of New Haven , which would have been a tragedy for most youths , came as anp177equal relief to Ferguson and the authorities . Halfway through freshman year it became evident that Yale was too big for him ; he had come from a small high school where he had distinguished himself as a tight end on the football team , and the fact that he could n't even make the freshmansquad at Yale dimmed his pleasure at being in the college of Dink Stover and Pudge Heffelfinger . When the midyear grades were in he was summoned to the office of the Dean of Freshmen , a tweedy man who smoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the young man through the tops of his glasses , and said , " Sit down , Mr. Ferguson . " Ferguson sat , affecting boredom , and the Dean went on , " Did you study anything last term ? " Ferguson looked puzzled , and said , " I went to my classes , if that 's what you mean . " " It 's not what I mean . " The Dean glanced at a paper in front of him and said , " And you did n't go to all your classes , by a long shot . What did you do ? " " This and that , " Ferguson replied . " If you want an honestanswer , I must admit that a good deal of the time I was bored . " A sophomore acquaintance had told him that nonchalancewas the best approach in a sticky situation , and he had gone to some lengths to curb his incandescent temper . " To put it more bluntly , " he went on , " I was dis-appointed . " " Ah ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In Yale . It does n't come up to what I expected . " Fergusonstudied his fingernails , and the Dean swiveled his chair around and looked out at the rainy New Haven landscape . After a few moments , he turned back . " Mr. Ferguson , " he said , " we have tried to go on thep178theory here that if a man can get into Yale , he can stay in . It often happens that freshmen are unused to the routine and do poorly the first little while , and we try to understand this , and cooperate . Sometimes , when a man is not as  --  ah  --  mature as the rest of his classmates , we allow him to drop out for a year , get a job , and then return when he has grown up a bit . We do our best , as I said , to understand his problems and help him along . " He paused , consideringhis phraseology , and then said , " In your case , I think we are prepared to make an exception . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And sever your connections right now . Fully and finally . " Ferguson rose . " I think that 's a splendid idea , " he said , " Those are the first intelligent words I 've heard since I got here . " He went back to his room , packed his clothes , and took the train to New York . In New York , he had a perfectly splendid time . He had the money his family had sent him for the next semester , and he decided to indulge himself a bit before letting them in on the fact there would be no next semester , at least as far as Yale was concerned . Although out of Yale , he continued to use its name and its Club , and he found that under certain circumstances it was a very convenient name to drop . Jack &; Charlie 's " 21 , " for instance , had a known weakness for Yale men , and he managed to run up a sizablebill there before someone thought to ask him where his classes were held . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his student 's draft exemption no longer held , and he was of a ripe age to be plucked by the SelectiveService . He wired his family that he was coming home and would explain everything when he got there.  |p179The  explanation did n't go over very well . His father , a real-estate broker in Tandem Falls , Michigan , was all for sending him down to the Draft Board at once , but his mother pleaded that he be given another chance if he promised to behave himself and study hard . This he promised , and he went to a college more suited to his way of life . It was here that he got the idea of joining the Navy R.O.T.C. At Yale , he had seen the Rotcy boys , as they were called , drilling on the playing fields , and he had seen how they took precedence over those who wanted to play intramural sports . In fact , the Rotcy boys had a pretty good life , and if you could n't make a varsity team , you were better off being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of prestige , and a uniform , and when you were through you got to be an officer , which was more than the football team could guarantee you . Ferguson was sure he could make the team here , but he 'd rather be a Navy officer than a football player in a minor college , so he opted for the course . It 's time you thought a little bit about the future , he told himself as he signed the papers . Football is all very well in its place , but there 's a lot more to life than playing football . He realized how stupid he 'd been not to take the Rotcy at Yale , instead of spending his time brooding about not being a football player . Well , we live and we learn , he thought , and decided to be the highestrankingcadet by the time he got out of college . And he was . The drilling and the giving of commands came to him naturally , and he enjoyed it , and as an added advantage he found that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a joke in his unit that his dress blues had had pecker tracks washed off them so often that the front of the trousers was shiny , but Fergusonp180did n't mind being the butt of jokes like that . It indicated a certain prowess , and set him apart from the rest . About other jokes he was n't so amiable ; he broke two ribs of a classmate who had asked to run barefoot through his curly hair , and whenever the subject of Yale came up ( which was not often ) he became silent and morose . He could n't help thinking how much better it would have been to be ranking man of the Yale Rotcy unit , rather than the one from Jerkwater U. Once he graduated , he could pretend he 'd gone to Yale all along , but until then he was MidshipmanFerguson from Jerkwater U. , and it irritated him . He 'd show them , though . Once he was an Ensign , then they 'd see . He became the hottest Ensign to hit the fleet , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His fitness reports glowed with praise from his commanding officers , and when he was promoted to Junior Grade Lieutenant his skipper remarked that if he 'd had anything to say about it , the promotion would have come through sooner . The only thing that Ferguson lacked , when he came to think of it , was a war . He had trained for the last several years in the various aspects of naval warfare , he was rising fast in an organization whose whole purpose was the carrying on of warfare ( albeit under such euphemisms as " maintaining the sea lanes " ) , and to take warlike stances without followingthrough was , to him , like waving your parts at a girl without laying her . When , in October of 1962 , the Cuban missile crisis developed , he thought that at last he was goingto have a chance to prove himself in battle , but the whole thing washed out in a  --  to him  --  disappointing and humiliating stalemate . He had hoped that the Navy andp181Marines would invade Cuba while the Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While his destroyer was on patrol off Cuban waters , an incident occurred that had a sharp effect on him , and on his relations with enlisted men . It gave him , he felt , an insight that few other officers possessed , because he witnessedthe shining epitome of how not to behave . It was a clear and sunny day , and the men on the deck force were engaged in the endless chipping and painting that is a way of life on Navy ships at sea . Weather permitting , they start at the bow and work their way aft , chipping away the rust , then polishing the bare steel with a wire brush , then applyingan undercoat of red lead or zinc chromate , and then the final coat of grey . By the time they reach the stern , small spots of rust have begun to appear on the bow again , and the whole process is repeated . This day , one man was working on the ladder that came down from the bridge , carefully applying grey paint to the spots where red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Annapolisgraduate of the cold and efficient type , came rattlingdown the ladder and felt his hand touch wet paint . He looked at the smear with irritation and then , not saying a word , wiped it on the shirt of the man who was doing the painting , and walked away . Ferguson saw the look on the man 's face , and was not surprised to hear later that a monkeywrench had dropped through a hatch when the Exec was in the engine room , narrowly missing him . This incident led Ferguson to review his own attitude toward enlisted men , and he concluded he 'd been too cold and impersonal . They were , after all , human beings like himself , and it would n't hurt to unbend a little every nowp182and then , and show that he was human too . He might have the rank to command respect , but rank meant nothing unlessa little humanity was mixed in with it . He felt it was a valuable lesson , and he intended to profit from it . There was no radical change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a cause , but signs of sloppiness began to show up in his division that had n't been there before . The men still tried , or seemed to be trying , and he was sure they liked him better for being more down-toearthand informal , but the fact remained that mistakes were being made for which there was no rational reason . Ferguson was n't aware of their cumulative effect until time for his annual fitness report came around , and even then he could n't understand the cause . By Navy Regulations a commanding officer is required to show an officer his fitnessreport only if it is unsatisfactory , when the officer is given a chance to make a written explanation , but Ferguson'sfirst report had been so good that the Captain had shown it to him anyway , as an incentive to keep up the work . When time for the next one came , the Captain pretendedit did n't exist , and Ferguson was disturbed . He did n't want to ask , but he could n't stand not knowing , so he went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come in , and Ferguson entered and stood at attention . " Captain , sir , " he said , " have I done anything wrong ? " " Not that I know of , " the Captain replied . " Why ? " " My fitness report , sir . I have n't seen it . " " Oh , that . " The Captain wished he 'd never shown him the first one , and tried to brush the whole thing off . " There 's nothing the matter with that . " " If it 's unsatisfactory , sir , I should  --  "  | " It 's nowhere near unsatisfactory . I 've already sent it to the Bureau , or I 'd show it to you . " " Is it as good as the last ? " " No , but that would be very hard . I think it 's inevitable that a little leveling off should set in . I would n't worry . " " Just where did the leveling off take place , sir ? " Fergusonfelt signs of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to keep something from him . " I think you 're the one to answer that , " the Captain replied . " You know better than I where you 're trying and where you are n't . " Ferguson reddened . " I 'm trying in all respects , sir . I would n't be here if I were n't . " " Well , two examples . When I made inspection last Saturday , the fan blades in B Compartment were dusty . They 've always been clean before . And Glockenden had on a non-Reg neckerchief and his shoes were n't shined . These are small things , but they 're part of a whole . You know better than I do how to correct them . " " Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . " Ferguson went immediately to Glockenden 's compartment , and found him lying on his bunk reading a comic book . " Listen , you , " he said , " what the hell do you mean wearing a non-Reg neckerchief at Captain 's inspection ? " Glockenden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alreadybeen through that , " he said . " The Captain and I had a little talk . " " And your shoes were n't shined , either . What kind of a slob are you , anyway ? " " Look , " said Glockenden , sitting up . " You were there . Why did n't you say something about it at the time  --  why do you get your tits in a flurry at this late date ? "  | " Because I just got my ass chewed for it , that 's why ! " Ferguson exploded . " And it 's all your goddam fault ! " " Oh , Jesus , " Glockenden said , getting up from his bunk and going toward the head . " Is this going to be one of those days ? " " Listen , goddammit , I 'm speaking to you ! " Ferguson shouted . " Wait until I 've finished ! " " You wait , " Glockenden said , dropping his shorts and going into one of the stalls . " I ca n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , if he had n't missed his ship in Boston . It was due to sail at o600 and all shore leave expired at midnight , but Ferguson knew that an hour or so would n't matter as far as he was concerned . Actually , he was headed back toward the Navy Yard at 1130 , and would have made it in plenty of time if he had n't stopped in for one last drink at a bar on Washington Street . A girl was sitting at the far end of the bar , watching television with a stunned expression while she toyed with the remains of a once-frothy red drink . Her eyes flicked toward him as he came in , then returned to the television set , and he looked at her appraisingly . He had already had one woman that night , a waitressfrom a sea-food restaurant , but it had been hurried and unsatisfactory , and he felt he could use one more round before going back to the ship . Nobody knew how long they 'd be at sea , so he 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slimmer than the waitress , and probably ten years younger , and although she could never have been called beautiful , her lips and breasts were well formed , and she looked healthy . Ferguson slid onto the stool next to her , ordered a gin and tonic , and pretended top185watch the television . A smell like a new-cut grass hung around the girl , and it aroused him . " May I buy you a drink ? " he asked . She swiveled her head and eyes around , and regarded him for a few moments . " All right , " she said . Ferguson knew he was home free . " What are you having ? " " A Ward Eight . " To the bartender , he said , " And a Ward Eight , please , " and then , " I never heard of that one . " " You ever been to Boston before ? " she asked . He had , several times , but he decided to play it the other way and said , " No . I 'm new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me around . " She looked directly into his eyes , and said , " All right . What do you want to see ? " It was all part of a formalized routine , as ritualistic as the mating dance of the whooping crane , and if for nothing else than tradition it had to be acted out to the last step . " Whatever you want to show me , " Ferguson said . " I 'm in your hands . " " The Bunker Hill Monument , or the Prudential tower ? " she said , naming the only two phallic symbols in Boston . " Let 's try Bunker Hill , " he replied . " That 's where you do n't fire till you see the whites of their eyes . " " Say , you 're sharp , are n't you ? " said the girl . " I get around . " " You Navy men . I suppose you got a girl in every port . " Ferguson grinned , showing his teeth . " And a couple in between . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sorry . That 's classified information . " It was n't , but it sounded good . Their drinks arrived , and she sipped hers . She looked at him for a moment or two , then said , " You 're cute . " " You have n't seen anything , " he replied , making one of the pirouettes of the dance . " Yet . " " You 'd be surprised what I seen . " " Surprise me . " " Boo ! " " You can do better than that . " " Not in here . " " Then perhaps we should leave . " " Is there any hurry ? " " None at all . I like to take it slow . And easy . " " Then let 's finish our drinks , all right ? " " All right . " They finished their drinks , and as he was helping her into her coat , she said , " You got a room ? " " Yes , but it 's against regulations on board ship . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you home . " " You got a car ? " " No , but I assume there are taxis in Boston . " As they went out the door , she said , " You sure you want to do this ? " " Would I be doing it if I were n't ? Nobody 's got a gun at my head , have they ? " She giggled . " Not yet . " " What does that mean ? " " Nothing . Nobody 's got a gun at your head . " " You 're not one of these gangsters ' broads , are you ? "  | " Who are you calling a broad ? " " Sorry . Have you a boyfriend who carries guns ? " " No . Not that I know of . " " All right , then . " He whistled at a taxi , and it pulled over to the curb and they got in . As they settled back in the seat , he said , " Where do you live ? " " Revere . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " It 's just through the tunnel . Twenty minutes , at the most . " " All right . Driver , we want to go to Revere . " " It 's on Atlantic Avenue , driver , " she said . " Number 1423 . " They went through the Callahan Tunnel and out the darkened streets to Revere , and each turn the driver made took them into a quieter neighborhood . Finally the girl indicated a house , and when the cab stopped , Ferguson said to the driver , " Hold your flag , will you ? I wo n't be long . " " How long is long ? " the driver asked . Ferguson looked at the girl . " Fifteen , twenty minutes . A half hour at the most . " " Sorry , " said the driver . " I 'm due back in the barn right now . You can call for a cab when you 're ready . " " Where do I call ? " " Here . " The driver handed him a business card with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out . The cab drove off with what he thought was unnecessary speed , and as he took the girl 's arm and started up the front walk she said . " You ever seen a stiff ? " " A what ? " said Ferguson , letting go her arm . " A stiff . A body . A corpse . "  | " Yes . Why ? " " I just wondered . My uncle 's got one in the parlor , and I do n't want it should be a shock . " " Your uncle  --  " Ferguson looked at the house , which was of Victorian red brick design , and over the door he saw an unlighted sign saying FUNERAL HOME . He stopped walking , and said , " What the hell is this , anyway ? " " Nothing . This is where I live . " She continued toward the front door , saying , " You should see the way my uncle fixes them up . Most of ' em look like nothing at all , but my uncle can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . I do n't know how he does it . " She looked back and saw Ferguson standing in the walk , and said , " What 's the matter ? You chicken or something ? " " No , " Ferguson replied . " Of course not . " " Then come on . " He still hesitated , so she said , " Oh , all right , " and started around to the back of the house . " I suppose it 's better to go in this way anyway , " she said . " Just in case Mr. Stiff should be up and walking around . " Ferguson followed her to the back door , and she opened it and beckoned him inside . The house was dark , and a sweet smell hung in the air like fog , and the girl led him into the parlor . He could make out the faint outlines of furniture , and potted palms , and at the far end of the room a long rectangular shape with a square flap rising from one end . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through and tinted various objects , causing the square flap to take on a satiny shine . " Look , " said Ferguson . " I did n't come here to  --  " " Shhh , " the girl whispered . " You 'll wake my uncle . " She lay down on a horse-hair sofa , and as she was undoing her garter belt Ferguson grabbed her by the neck , pulled herp189upright , and hit her twice across the face . She screamed , and he turned and ran out of the house , knocking over vases and end tables as he went . She was still screaming when he got outside , and he saw a light go on upstairs ; he ran as fast as he could to the corner , turned down a side street , and zigzaggedhis way toward what he hoped was the main thoroughfare . He ran until his breath gave out , and then walked toward a glow in the sky that seemed to indicate civilization . By the time he reached the shopping district , everything was closed , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone for a cab . He finally , after walking for what seemed like hours , found an all-night Hayes Bickforddiner , where the counter man let him use the phone in back , and he had a hamburg with onions while he waited for the cab to arrive . He found that he was trembling , and wished there were someplace where he could get a drink . When he saw the lights of the cab and went outside , he realized with horror that the sky was a pinkish blue and daylight was approaching . He looked at his watch , which indicated twenty minutes to six , and he dove into the cab and told the driver to get to the Navy Yard as fast as he could . The cab took off and rattled and banged through the nearly empty streets , but as it approached the Mystic River Bridge , the first of the morning traffic had begun to build up , and speed was impossible . Ferguson pounded on the back of the driver 's seat and screamed for him to hurry , and although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a filling station , it was two minutes before six when he drew up at the gates of the Navy Yard . Fergusonthrew money at him and flung out of the cab , groping for his I.D . card to show the sentry . He went through the gates at a dead run , holding the I.D . card in one hand andp190returning the sentry 's salute with the other , and as he sped through the streets he started shouting " Wait ! Wait for me ! " The speed limit in the Yard is ten miles per hour , but Ferguson was making better than fifteen as he rounded the last corner and raced down the dock , and although he saw that his ship was already out in the stream he kept running , and his speed carried him another five yards through open air before he hit the water . His first instinct was to inhale a lungful and drown , but the survival instinct was stronger , and he made his way back to the pilings and was hauled out by a pair of incredulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained that he 'd got a bad clam at a seafood restaurant , and had been so paralyzed with nausea that he had been unable to move . And although he was able to establish that he had been to the restaurant ( the waitress proved as obliging in this respect as she had been in the other ) , the court was not impressed by the rest of his testimony . He lost twenty numbers in seniority , and was transferred to a minesweeper working out of Adak . It was the loss of numbers that cost him his next promotion , with the result that it was over a year more before he finally made Lieutenant . In that time he grew a carapace of cynicism which protected him from the knowledge that he was n't going to get very far in the Navy after all . Now , with a detail of armed men under his command , he felt every inch the warrior and hoped there would be some way to prove himself and possibly even win an officialcommendation . As he and Bromley and Stackpole went down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any signs of machinery that would require diesel oil , and they also kept their eyes open for anything edible . Ferguson 's knowledge of his power made him anxious to use it , and he was ready for any excuse to show what he could do . He had Bromley and Stackpole cock their guns and put them on safety , and he did the same with his .45 , leaving the flap of the holster open . He walked with a slight crouch , as though actually under fire . The settlement looked more like a collection of tarpaper shacks than anything else , although one or two buildings were made out of more solid material . Some of the roofs were of corrugated iron , some were thatched , and some had tiles , and the one thing they had in common was that they were designed to afford protection from the sun . There were visible heat waves undulating across the corrugatedroofs , and most of the windows were shuttered against the blazing light . The dusty street was deserted , and Ferguson wondered if the people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen him coming and were hiding . He walked slowly and carefully down the center of the street , with Bromley and Stackpole in single file behind him , and he had just about decided that the settlement was deserted when from the distance came the sound of a quick burst of machine-gun fire . He froze in his tracks , crouched low , and brought out his .45 and slid his thumb onto the safety catch , at the same time motioning the men to stop . They listened this way for almost a minute , but there was no other sound and finally Ferguson straightened up and relaxed . " Whoever he was , he got no back talk , " he said , hoping it was n't Ensign Tuttle who 'd made first contact . I don'tp192think I could stand that , he thought . If that little prong were to get something I did n't  --  He put the idea out of his mind , and started forward again . Around a bend in the road , he saw a sign that at first he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its faded red letters spelled JOLLY ROGER TAVERN . " I will be everlastingly damned , " Ferguson said , grinning . " Let 's see what this is all about . " Cautiously , he preceded the men up the narrow boardwalk , and they could hear tinny radio music coming from inside . With the muzzle of his .45 Ferguson prodded the swinging doors open , and sprang inside . Ralph Matsuma was stirring a pot over the charcoal brazier with a portable radio beside him , and his eyes widened and he jumped back . " Do n't move , " Ferguson commanded . " Is anyone else here ? " Ralph shook his head and glanced at the two gunners who followed Ferguson through the doors . He half raised his hands , and moistened his lips . " I am alone , " he said . " I do no harm . " " Look around , " Ferguson said , without taking his eyes off Ralph , and Bromley and Stackpole separated and wanderedthrough the dim interior . To Ralph , Ferguson said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My name is Matsuma , " Ralph replied . " Mr. Ralph Matsuma . " " All right , Matsuma , what are you cooking ? " Ralph glanced at the pot and said , " Tail of iguana . " " Do n't give me that crap . " Ferguson approached the pot , looked in , and saw a white , fleshy appendage in a slowly bubbling broth . Then he looked at Ralph . " You got any diesel oil ? " he asked  |p193Ral|ph  hesitated a moment , then shook his head . " I cook with charcoal only , " he replied . " I did n't ask what you cook with , I asked if you have any diesel oil . " " No . " " Do you have any food ? " " Some men think tail of iguana a delicacy . " " I mean besides that . Where 's your storeroom ? " " I have no storeroom , " Ralph said , trying to remember if he had closed the trap door into the root cellar . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at open market . " " Where 's the market ? " " Here and there . " " Look , boy , do n't get cute with me . Where can I find some food ? " " I do not answer the name boy . ' My name is Mr. Ralph Matsuma . " " Answer my question . " " When you address me correctly . " " Where , Matsuma , is the market ? " Ferguson felt his face getting red . " Mr. Matsuma , " Ralph said , quietly . " God damn it , am I going to have to beat you with this ? " Ferguson reversed his pistol , and held it by the barrel . " Not if you address me as Mr. Matsuma . " " Mr. Matsuma , would you do me the favor of telling me where the market is ? " Ferguson was fighting a losing battle with his temper , and he wanted to get the information before he exploded . " There is no market place . One man keep the chicken , another go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vege/tables . Every man on the island produce food in his own way , and then trade with others . " " Where do I find the man with the chickens ? " Before Ralph could reply , Stackpole appeared and said , " Mr. Ferguson , he 's got a jukebox here , and electric lights . Somewhere he 's got to have a generator . " " Aha , " said Ferguson , grinning at Ralph . " Go out back and look . " Stackpole went out , and a look of recognition began to creep across Ralph 's face . " Do I hear your name is Ferguson ? " he asked . " That 's right . And since we 're being so formal , it 's Mr. Ferguson to you . " " Ah , yes , " said Ralph . " Now I see . " " What do you see ? " " Nothing . I recognize the name . " " From where ? " Ralph looked at the ceiling . " There was a young ladytalk about you , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're out of your mind . Who wants to see me ? " " Her name is Emilie . She work for Mister Paul . " " Oh , yes , I remember . What does she want ? " " She say she wish you to go to her house . " " And I just might do that . I 've got a couple of questions I 'd like to ask her . " " I am sure she will be happy to reply . " " Where does she live ? " " In a small shack by the docks . Right behind where the fish nets dry . " " Well , now . Maybe the day wo n't be a total loss , after all . " " I am sure not . "  | " I think Miss Emilie is too smart for her own good . What do you think ? " " I know her too long to think anything . " Stackpole reappeared , and said , " He 's got one , sir . It 's an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil with it . " Ferguson laughed . " Take it , " he said . " You and Bromleyunhook it and take it up the hill . " " We 'll have to roll it , " Stackpole said . " We got nothing to carry it in . " " I do n't care how you do it , " Ferguson said . " Just get it up to Grimond 's house . " " Aye , sir , " said Stackpole , and he and Bromley left . " Now , " Ferguson said , approaching Ralph , " there 's one little matter we ought to get straight . We may be here a few days , and we 're going to need food and things like that . If I ask you a question , I do n't want you lying to me the way you just did . Do you understand ? " Ralph half closed his eyes , and stared at Ferguson and said nothing . " I said do you understand ? " Ferguson said , his voice rising . Ralph 's features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trance . " You 've been begging for this . " Still holding his pistol by the barrel , Ferguson brought his arm back and hit Ralph a blow across the the side of the head that knocked him to the floor . He lay there , conscious but motionless , and his upper cheekbone began to glisten red . Ferguson returned his pistol to its holster . " Just remember that , " he said . " Next time you 're tempted to lie , think twice . " Ralph 's eyes showed that he heard , but he made no reply.  | " Mr. Matsuma , " Ferguson concluded , and went outside . Bromley and Stackpole had leaned their machine guns against the side of the building , and were examining the pipe connection to the fuel drum when Ferguson joined them . " What 's the problem ? " Ferguson asked . " We need a wrench or something , " Bromley replied . " Somehow , we got to unscrew the connection . " " Shoot it off , " Ferguson suggested . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the oil would squirt all over , " said Bromley . " We got to plug it up before we can move it . " " Well , I 'm going to let you worry about that , " Ferguson said . " I 've got some business down by the docks . " " We 'll get it done , " Stackpole said . " It 's just going to take a little time . " " And I may , too , " said Ferguson . " If I 'm not back when you 've got it off , start along and I 'll catch up . " " O.K. , " said Stackpole . " Good luck . " Ferguson glanced at him to see what he meant , but Stackpole was intent on the fuel connection and did n't look up . Ferguson started to say something , then turned and left . " I do n't know how he does it , " Bromley said , when Fergusonhad gone . " We been on this frigging island less than a day , and already he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it this way , " Stackpole replied . " It keeps him out of our hair , so let 's not complain . " " Amen , " said Bromley . " Say , maybe that gook has a tool for this . I 'll go in and ask him . " He disappeared , and came back in a few minutes tense and trembling . " That son of a bitch , " he said . " That miserable , mother-fucking son of a bitch . "  | " What did he do ? " Stackpole asked . " It 's not him , it 's Ferguson . Ferguson pistol-whipped him . For two cents I 'd quit this whole operation , and join the natives . " Ferguson had no trouble finding Emilie 's shack . It was , as Ralph had said , directly behind the net-drying yard , and she was standing in front of it as though she expected him . Her face beamed as he approached . " Hello ! " she said , when he got within speaking distance . " I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for long , " he replied . " I 've got a couple of questions I 'd like to ask . " " Ask me anything . Do you want to stay here , or go in-side ? " " Just tell me if you cut that fuel line , and if so why . " " What fuel line , Mr. Ferguson ? " Emilie 's blue eyes were wide and innocent as she looked up at him . Her whole body gave the odd impression she was shaking with laughter . " You know damned well what fuel line , " Ferguson said , taking her arm . " The one to the generator . " " All I know is what happens when you touch me , " Emilie said , her face radiating joy . " Last night , after you held me , I was so excited I could n't sleep . " " Look , let 's stick to the subject , should we ? " Ferguson was unsettled , because her delight seemed genuine . " I want to know about that fuel line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who cares who cut it ? If I cut it , it was only so I could see you again . " " That 's a stupid answer and you know it . Also , you were n't all so fired-up to see me last night . You called me ap198Yankee son of a bitch , if I remember correctly . " " I had to , because of the others . But all the time I was wanting you  --  just like I want you now . " " Oh , come on . " Ferguson cleared his throat , and glanced quickly around . " Do n't think you can put me on with a line like that . " " I 'm not trying to put you on . " She cupped her free hand against his crotch , and said , " Does that look like I 'm trying to put you on ? " Ferguson began to tremble . He cleared his throat again , and said , " Maybe we 'd better talk about this  --  uh  --  this is kind of public out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She beamed even more brightly , and pulled aside the burlap curtain that hung in the doorway . " Please step into my parlor , " she said . When the curtain fell behind them she clung to him , and Ferguson gave up all resistance . He unhooked his gun belt and dropped it on a chair , and as his eyes became accustomed to the dim light he saw a long-bladed knife on a table by the bed . " My God , " he said . " What 's that for ? " Emilie had slipped out of her dress , and she hugged him and laughed . " Do n't worry about that , " she said . " I use it to keep away prowlers , but now that you 're here I do n't have to worry . Everything is going to be all right . Everythingis going to be beautiful . "  |p199WHEN  EVERS REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS , he was lying facedown on the floor of the shack . The first thing he was aware of was the pain in his head , which felt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , as his eyes came into focus , he saw small items in the dirt beneath his nose  --  a chicken feather , a dried twist of fruit rind , the desiccatedleg of a rat , and a strip of filthy cloth . The smell came to him next , and he rolled over , bumped into the box on which he 'd been sitting , and painfully dragged himself out into the hot brightness of the fresh air . He lay there for a few moments , gingerly felt the side of his head , and then sat up . A wave of dizziness overcame him , and he lay back again . My , he thought . That guy may have looked fragile ,  |p200but  he packed a mean punch . Then he remembered the man 's having taken his gun , and he sat up again . I 've got to find him and get it back . All hell 's going to break loose if I do n't . A man in his mood , with a loaded submachine gun , running into Ferguson . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling the pain travel from his head down his spine and into his feet . He did n't know such pain could exist ; it rang in his teeth , it made his mouth taste coppery , and it pulsed through his body in throbbing waves , like surf . It was pain like . . . What was it the man had said ? . . . " When you have the pain you can not bear  --  " The pain tree . He reached in his pocket and pulled out the nut he 'd taken from the tree , and examined it . If a leaf from the tree was supposed to help , then what might the nut do ? Clearly something good , because it was reserved for the obeah man and guarded by threats of hideous malformation . Well , what was there to lose ? He doubted his feet would drop off , and if there was anything that would help his present pain , it would be worth a few minor sideeffects . He turned the nut in his fingers , then put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a few slivers with his front teeth . It tasted bitter but not inedible , and he took a little more , and waited . The tip of his tongue felt slightly cottony , but aside from that there was no significantchange . He spat , but the cottony feeling remained on his tongue . The hell with it , he thought . I guess it 's too much to expect anything from a native superstition . He tossed the nut away , and wondered which way the man had gone . Toward the settlement , probably . At any rate , that 's where Ferguson was , so that 's where there was the most danger of trouble . Slowly , walking with great care , Eversp201started on a path that led toward the sea , where he could follow the shore around to the docks . Either his pain was abating or he was getting used to it ; at any rate , it no longer had a paralyzing effect , and he was able to think a little more clearly . His problems , as he counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had only been the matter of finding food and fuel , then came the still unidentifiedshots , then the native outraged at the loss of his chickens , and now , finally , that native loose with a machinegun . What had started as a relatively simple quest had become progressively more complicated , and each new development brought with it the possibility of something worse . It was like opening that famous Russian doll , inside of which was another , and then another , except in this case each successive doll became uglier , and more dangerous . He could imagine the final doll as being , instead of diminutive and pretty , a hideous afreet that would seize him by the throat and bite out his eyes and devour him and his crew the way the Cyclops had devoured Odysseus ' men . Wrenching off their legs and arms and sucking the bones clean and white , biting off their heads like grapes . . . What got me into this line of thought ? Why am I having daytime nightmares ? Do I have a concussion , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , or the nut from the pain tree , or what ? Whatever it was , I 've got to stop it . I ca n't afford to be thinking like this . He spat again , and the cottony feeling seemed to have spread from the tip to his whole tongue . He twisted it around in his mouth , and spat once more , and fluttered his tongue and said aloud , " God damn . " It sounded odd , and he tried it again , and then he said , " Son of a bitch , " andp202found to his horror that the sibilant sounds did n't work . The pain-tree nut had anesthetized his tongue , and now the anesthesia was probably spreading to his throat , and then . . . He felt cold and began to tremble , and his first instinctwas to run , but he did n't know where . All right , get a grip on yourself . There 's nothing you can do but wait and see what happens , so do n't run screaming into the village and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply , and remember that if you lose your head , the whole ball game is gone . You can be stricken deaf , dumb , and blind , but you 've got to pretend everything 's just fine . Remember your skipper who joked about being seasick . If you can joke about seasickness , you can joke about anything , so start thinking of something funny . What 's funny about having your tongue paralyzed , and maybe your throat and lungs ? What 's funny about suffocation ? The same thing that 's funny about botulism , or quicksand , or a crushed pelvis . Gallows humor , they call it  --  or nowadays black humor . Some big joke : two-and-ahalfgold stripes on your sleeves , and you ca n't even say " son of a bitch " correctly . Ho , ho , ho . That kills me . He took a deep breath , and found that he had no trouble . Another deep breath was the same ; the air reached all the way into the recesses of his lungs . The only problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly . At least he would n't strangle ; he 'd simply sound drunk , and there were worse things than that . All at once everything seemed all right , and with his flash of panic gone he wondered why he 'd ever worried . He realized if you resist panic , even for a few seconds , it will pass ; the only danger is in succumbing immediately , when it becomesirreversible . Like losing your balance , once controlp203is gone it 's gone , and no amount of gyrating will get it back . He breathed deeply again , ran his benumbed tongue across his lips , and smiled . He was nearing the shore when he heard voices ahead of him , and he instinctively ducked off the path and hid behindwhat turned out to be a large and bristling variety of cactus , with spines the size of sailmaker 's needles . As he tried , painfully , to make himself invisible , he wondered why he was doing it and what he was afraid of . Maybe I 'm developing a form of animal cunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tells me of danger , because my normal reaction on hearing people is not to duck under a cactus . But then , nothing about this place is normal , so I 'd better wait and see who 's coming before I start behaving normally . The voices were sporadic , and spoke in low tones , and as they came closer Evers recognized the language as Spanish . He could identify but not understand it , and the only other thing he could tell was that there was friction ; someone was angry or disgruntled , and someone else was trying to quiet him . Then the figures came into view , and he was glad he 'd hidden . There were about a dozen men , armed and wearing olive-green fatigue uniforms , and they walked with the wariness of men going into action . They did n't have the crouch of battle , but they were n't walking upright either ; their heads were forward , and they walked on the balls of their feet rather than on their heels . The lead man wore a black beret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and assorted headgear . They all had beards except one  --  the last in line  --  and he looked too young to grow one . Giving him every possible break in age , he looked no more than fourteen , and his dark eyesp204were Iarge and round like those of an astonished baby . He looked from one side of the trail to the other as though expecting a momentary attack , and he held a submachine gun at the ready in front of him . He seemed to Evers so nervous that a bird call would start him shooting . The argument was between the lead man and the man two behind him , who clearly liked nothing about the day , or his life , or whatever it was they were doing . His tone was abused and self-righteous , and he was talking more to himself than anyone else , but at times the leader would snap at him , and he 'd be briefly quiet . Then the complaints would start again , accompanied by gestures , and the leader would say something louder , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sounded like the way Ferguson and Tuttle talked to each other . I guess every unit has its troubles , he thought ; I 'm not alone in my woes . He made himself as small as possible , gritting his teeth against the stabs of the cactus and hoping the men would get past quickly . At the moment it did n't matter what they were doing ; all that mattered was that they not discover him . He did n't need to understand their language to know that . It was the youth who spotted him . All the others had gone by , and Evers was beginning to breathe again , when the youth looked directly at him ; their eyes met , and for a second they stared at each other while the youth 's eyes widened until they seemed the size of tennis balls , and then he shouted " i Oye ! " and started shooting . Evers put his arms over his head and drew his knees into his chest , as bullets whipped past and bits of severed cactus fell about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the firing stopped . He opened his eyes , and looked into thep205barrels of five guns that surrounded him like spokes of a wheel . From behind them he heard the voice of the leader say , " ' Pablo , tu bastardo loco ! " and there was the sound of a slap . Then the bearded face under the beret looked down at him and said , " iQuien es ? " " Sorry , " Evers replied , through his thick tongue . " Non parlo . " The man stared at him ; someone said , " Bastardo gringo , " and someone else said , " Borracho . " " Get up , " said the man with the beret . Evers uncoiled himself and gingerly got to his feet . He looked at the hostile faces around him , and then back at the leader . " You drunk ? " the man asked . Evers shook his head . He tried to say , " I ate the nut of the pain tree , " but it came out , " Oi ay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long silence . " Loco , " somebody said . " Completamente loco . " Then there was a great deal of talk he did n't understand ; like most Latins , they seemed unable to discuss anything without having the discussion sound like an argument that would shortly end in a blood feud . Finally the leader said , " You from the Yankee ship ? " and Evers shook his head , hoping they would n't search him and find his dog tag . Enunciating with great care , he managed to get out the word " Beachcomber. " " yagabundo ? " a man asked , and Evers nodded quickly , smiling . The leader looked undecided . Then he took a deep breath , turned to the man who had been complaining , and snapped his fingers and said , " Ernesto , tu cint6. "  | " Madre de Dios , por que ? " the man shouted , clutching his waist . " gPor que mi cint6 ? " " iTu cint6 ! " the leader repeated , more sharply , and Ernesto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across . The leader took it , and turned to Evers and said , " Sit against that tree , please . " Evers did as directed , and the leader took his arms and put them behind the tree and bound them with Ernesto 's belt . " There are some who want to shoot you , " he said , as he worked . " But we will leave Pablo to guard you , and he will shoot you only if you try to escape . " He pulled the belt tighter , and stood up . " You understand ? " Evers nodded , and was about to try to speak when it occurred to him that his incoherence was an advantage ; they were less likely to worry about him if they thought him incapable of speech . So he said , " Wha oo ee ah , " and smiled as though it meant something . The leader regarded him thoughtfully . " You make some kind of trick ? " he asked . " No , no , " Evers replied , shaking his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue was subsiding , so as an extra precaution he added , " Ooa heek ka ooee ! " The leader shrugged and turned to Pablo , the youth , and gave him firm and precise instructions in Spanish . Pablo accepted them sullenly ; clearly , he would have rather gone with the rest than be left to guard this mad beachcomber , but he was just as clearly in no position to argue . He settled down with his back to a tree , facing Evers with his gun pointing at Evers ' stomach . There was more talk in Spanish , and then the men went off down the trail , leaving Evers and Pablo looking at one another like the last two men in a poker game . Pablo 's hatred was undisguised ;  |p207Evers  tried to appear detached , while he worked to loosen the coils of Ernesto 's belt . For several minutes neither of them spoke . " Hey , gringo , " Pablo said , at last . " I think I kill you . " " Why ? " Evers asked , reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evers cleared his throat and , speaking carefully , said , " Where did you learn your English ? " His tongue was better ; there was no doubt of it . " Never mind where . Gringo bastard . " " You speak it very well . " Evers ' tone was that of someonemaking conversation at a cocktail party . " You must have had an excellent teacher . " " Ha . " " I wish I spoke Spanish as well as you speak English . " He still had trouble with the sibilants , and this last sentencecame out poorly . " What 's the matter , gringo bastard ? " Pablo asked . " You drunk ? " " No . Speech defect . " " All gringo bastards drunk . All gringo bastards want jigjig . All the time drunk and jig-jig . " " You seem to know a great deal about Americans . Where have you met them ? " " My sister tell me . My sister make jig-jig with drunk gringo bastards . " " Ah , your sister . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him trouble , but his main problem was Ernesto 's belt , which remained tight . " None of you goddam business about my sister . My sisterhate goddam gringo bastards . " " Then why does she make jig-jig with them ? "  | " She no do that now . Fidel throw gringo bastards out of the country . " " Oh , I see . And what does your sister do now ? " Pablo glared at him with fury . " None of you goddam business ! " " I beg your pardon . It seemed a logical question . " " She no make jig-jig with nobody ! " " I did n't mean to imply that she did . " The belt slipped a little , and Evers tried to think of another conversational gambit . " I can see where a rest would be more than welcome , after a  --  uh  --  life of  --  ah  --  the old jig-jig . Would it surprise you to know that I , too , have a sister ? " Pablo 's eyes narrowed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a city  --  " Peoria , Illinois . When she was younger , she was known as the Sweet Pea of Peoria . " " What the hell that mean ? " " The belle  --  the debutante  --  I do n't know how to say it . " The belt came looser , and Evers talked as fast as he could to hold Pablo 's attention . " I do n't know what the word is in Spanish , but she was well known  --  her picture was in the paper  --  " " She make jig-jig ? " " Constantly . Day and night . With anybody and everybody . She immobilized the entire Peoria delegation to the Shriners ' convention of 196o  --  every man jack of them had to report to the hospital for penicillin shots , and there are some who are still there . Emily was a one-woman epidemic , and there was some talk of putting up a statue in her honor in the public square . The annals of medicine hold nothing that can even approach her case . She wasp209unique . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to think of something else . " You full of shit , " Pablo said , quietly . " I think I kill you . " " Oh , now , wait a minute . " Evers ' hands were finally free of the belt , but the gun was still pointing at his stomach . " I can prove every word I 've said . What do n't you believe ? " " That statue . Nobody put up statue to no puta . " " That 's where you 're wrong . Did you ever see the statue to Edith Cavell ? " " No . " " Or Florence Nightingale ? " " No . " " Well , I have a picture in my wallet . " " Give me see . " " I ca n't , with my hands bound . Come here and take it out of my pocket . " Pablo hesitated , and Evers went on , " If I 'm wrong , you can take my money . " " What money ? " " The money in my wallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastard . You no got money . " Evers shrugged . " Do n't believe me if you do n't want to . " " I kill you first , then take you money . " " Then it 'll be no good . " " Why not ? " " It 's all in Traveler 's Checks , and I have to sign them . If you kill me first , no bank in the world will cash them . " Pablo considered this . " How much Traveler 's Checks you got ? "  | " Plenty . Enough to make you a rich man . " " Then how come you vagabundo ? " " Pablo , you know your trouble ? " " What ? " " You 're too suspicious . You should trust your fellow man a little more , and you 'd find life a great deal more rewarding . " " I trust my fellow man . I no trust lying gringo bas-tards . " Evers shook his head . " Your sister must have had a hideousexperience , to make you hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some callous swine . " " You no worry about my sister . It no her heart got broke . " Pablo fingered the safety catch on his gun , and Evers saw he was running out of time . He clutched one end of the belt , and prepared to jump . " Are you sure you do n't want to see my pictures ? " he said . " I kill you first , then see you pictures , " Pablo replied . " And what 'll you tell your leader ? He said not to shoot unless I tried to escape . " Pablo spat , and slid his finger through the trigger guard . " I tell him you try to escape . He no care . He hate gringo bastards like everybody else . " " And so you 're going to throw away a fortune in Traveler'sChecks . I hope you realize the chance you 're passing up  --  the chance to be a wealthy , influential man . People will point to you in the street and say , There he goes  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Checks . ' But no  --  you 'd rather make a killing the other way . All right , if you want to . I guess it 's no business of mine . "  | " What the hell . You no got Traveler 's Checks . You try to give me a lot of shit about Traveler 's Checks ; no vagabundolike you got Traveler 's Checks . " " You think so ? Then look in my back pocket and see . What can you lose  --  except a great deal of money if you kill me first ? " Pablo spat again , then cradled the gun in one arm and moved toward Evers . " Gringo bastard always talk about money , " he said , reaching out the other hand . " Money no goddam good if you no have  --  " He did n't finish the sentence , because Evers swung the belt with all his strength , and the buckle lashed across Pablo 's mouth . Pablo shouted as Evers kicked at the gun , and then Evers was on top of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to pry the gun loose . Pablo struggled like a cat , clawing wildly and wide-eyed as he tried to scream through Evers ' hand , but he was small and thin and unable to move against the older man 's weight . Evers realized that what he was fighting was really a little boy ; Pablo had the animal smell of an adolescent , and his impotent rage made tears puddle up and run down his cheeks . Ashamed , he squeezed his eyes shut and tried to bite the hand that covered his mouth , but all he could do was make rasping sounds in his throat . My God , Evers thought , what am I going to do now ? I ca n't kill a child , but what else is left ? Can I knock him out without killing him ? Can I choke him just till he 's unconscious ? What can I do ? The gun had beencked aside , so there was no danger of anyone 's being shot ; the only problem was how to silence and immobilize this thrashing little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then he said , " Listen to me , Pablo . If I take my hand off your mouth , will youp212listen ? " Pablo 's reddened eyes stared up at him , and when Evers removed his hand Pablo screamed hoarsely , showing jagged teeth and thick , pink gums . Evers clapped his hand back again , and looked around desperately for an idea . The belt lay on the ground , and he might be able to tie Pablo with that , but the noise Pablo would make in the meantime would alert everyone within hearing . He could probably gag Pablo with a piece of shirt , but again there would be a period of noise until he could make the gag . What he had to do above everything was keep Pablo quiet , and he hated to think of the only sure way to do it . " Listen to me , Pablo , " he said , again . " I 'm going to tie you up , and I 'm going to put something in your mouth to keep you from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one way or another I 'm going to do it . If you fight me , I 'm going to hurt you ; if you do n't , I 'll do it gently . Do you understand ? " Pablo 's eyes glared at him as before , and when Evers removed his hand Pablo shrieked with a throat-tearingnoise . " Oh , God , " Evers said , pulling him to his feet . " If that 's the way you want it , all right . " He hit him hard , and again , and again , and then Pablo collapsed , sobbing in a tiny , squealing voice . Working as quickly as he could , Evers bound him to a tree with Ernesto'sbelt , then shredded a piece of Pablo 's shirttail and tied it around his mouth . Then he picked up the submachinegun , ffipped the catch to put it on safety , and hurried down the path that led to the sea . He realized he was weeping , but he could n't for the life of him understand why.  |p213AFTER  THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their various missions , Jackson and Simmonswent to the generator shed to see what was needed to repair the line . The shed stank of diesel oil ; the earth was black and spongy with it , and the tube itself was mangled by several blows from the ax . Whoever had done it had done it more in rage than calculation , because one blow would have been enough . Jackson squatted down and inspected the line , then said , " Man , that 's gon na need a new section tubing . There 's no repairing that piece of junk . " " So where we find tubing ? " Simmons said . " You think they got a plumber shop on this little old island ? " " I think we scrounge . Maybe there 's something here , and maybe we got ta borrow from someone else . " ( Nathaniel Benchley " I tell you what I 'm gon na do , " Simmons said . He sucked on a tooth , and a faraway look came into his eyes . " What ? " Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood up and looked around the shed . " I 'm gon na find me that little bird that come around here last night . She look like she be just about right for what I need . " Jackson looked at him in amazement . " You crazy , man ? " he said . " Are you trying to get yourself in trouble ? " " I ai n't crazy , bro . I being practical . " " Practical , my ass . You stay here and help me with this engine . " " They 's nothing I can do here . A Steward 's Mate do n't know his ass from a cold brick about engines , man , and you know it . " " You do n't have to know about engines . All you got ta do is find me a length of tubing . " " Well , if I see one around I 'll let you know . " Simmons strolled to the door of the shed , and raised a finger in farewell . " If I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Listen , you . " Jackson reached out , grabbed Simmons by the arm , and spun him around . " I 'm telling you to stay here . That 's an order . " " That 's a what ? " " You heard me . I 'm giving you an order , and you 'll Goddamnwell do what I say . " Simmons became rigid ; his eyes bulged , and his lips began to tremble . " An order ? " he said . " An order ? Who the shit you think you are to give me an order ? " His voice rose until it was almost a shriek , and he went on , " Some great fucking brother you are , trying to pull rank on me ! You think you some kind of white king shit or something ,  |p215you  can kick a brother around and give out orders ? You just crazy , man  --  you got your nose so far up Whitey 's ass you turning white yourself , and I do n't take no orders from nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but do n't give me no orders- " Jackson let go of Simmons ' arm and slapped him across the mouth , and Simmons turned , sobbing and shrieking , and ran into the adjacent building . He reappeared with a submachine gun , which he pointed at Jackson and squeezed the trigger , saying , " Take that , you white bastard . Take that  --  " " Put that gun down , " Jackson said , quietly . " In the first place , you do n't know how to use it , and in the second place , it ai n't loaded . Now , just simmer down . " " I wo n't simmer nothing for you . I going to do what I fucking well please , and you can stay with the rest of the Whiteys and give yourself orders . Just do n't speak to me again , and I mean it . Ever . " He turned , and started down the hill . " What you going to do with an unloaded gun ? " Jackson asked . " None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight around the building . As he walked toward the settlement , his rage subsided , but the hurt remained . The idea that Jackson would pull rank on him , that one brother would turn on another , was to him exactly like a knife in the stomach , and the pain radiated throughout his body . He clenched his teeth and tried to keep from crying again , but the tears welled up and ran down his nose and cheeks , and his throat clogged and he began to sob . Jackson 's slapping him had n't hurt , because it showed he 'd got through and hurt Jackson , andp216although under other circumstances it would have been terrible to think about , it paled now in contrast with the other , inconceivable wound . Everything he 'd felt about the solidarity of soul brothers against the white devils had been shattered by Jackson 's behaving like a white man . He 'd always believed it was black against white , forever and unchangeable , and now , somehow , the white man 's evil had infected a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too much to be borne ; there was very little to live for anyway , but there was absolutely nothing to live for if you could n't depend on a brother . Simmons ' legs felt weak , and he reeled over to a large rock at the side of the road , and sat on it and put his head in his arms and wept . He kicked the useless machine gun away from him , as though it were a symbol of everything that had conspired to bring him down . He heard faraway shots , but paid them no attention ; it did n't really matter who was shooting at what , because nothing mattered very much any more . Finally , when his grief had wrung him dry , he looked up and took a deep breath and wondered what to do next . He remembered his original project , to find that girl and make a score or two , and it occurred to him that that might be just what he needed , now more than ever , to restore some faith in himselfand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little better after he 'd made a score , and it could sure afford to look better now . He started along the path toward the settlement , saw the machine gun by the rock where he 'd kicked it , and on an impulse picked it up and slung it over his shoulder . You just never can tell , he thought . There might come a time when I have to zap me a gook . He had a faint memory that the gun was unloaded ,  |p217but  that did n't matter . Its mere presence in his hands made him feel powerful . He strolled down the dusty street of the settlement , and from behind a building saw Bromley and Stackpole appear , rolling a fifty-gallon fuel drum ahead of them . " Hey , man , " he said . " What you got there ? " The two men were red-faced and perspiring , and they stopped pushing and straightened up , glad of an excuse to rest . " We got us some fuel , " Bromley replied . " But I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it up the hill . You have n't seen a cart or a wagon lying around , have you ? " " Man , I ai n't seen nothing , " Simmons said . " But what I am about to see is something else again . " " Like what ? " said Stackpole , wiping an arm across his forehead . " Like that little piece of pussy that come around the place last night . Her and me is going to make beautiful music together . " " Watch out the Exec do n't catch you , " Bromley said . " He 's probably got there first , " Stackpole put in . " Old Simmons is gon na have to stand in line . " " Fuck the Exec , " said Simmons . " Where 'd he go to , anyway ? " " Down by the docks is all he told us , " Bromley replied . " You can figure the rest for yourself . " " I ai n't afraid of him , " said Simmons . " I got me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glancing at the weapon . " And no clip in it . " " That do n't worry me none , " said Simmons . " The way I look at it , a gun 's a gun . Who gives a shit , anyway ? "  | " Well , just watch out . " Bromley looked around , and said , " There 's got ta be a cart of some sort somewhere . These gooks do n't carry everything on their heads . " " I 'm gon na let that be your worry , " Simmons said . " You studs know where that little bird lives ? " " Now , how in the hell should we know ? " Stackpole replied . " We been working on this fuel drum since it seems like last Thursday . " " There 's a gook inside that place , there , " Bromley said , indicating the Jolly Roger . " He might know . But do n't depend on him being too helpful . The Exec just beat him up . " What for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? With Ferguson , there do n't have to be a reason . " " Well , well . " Simmons went into the Jolly Roger , where he saw Ralph Matsuma washing his face in the sink . A blood-stained towel was crumpled beside him . " Sorry to trouble you , brother , " Simmons said , and Ralph jumped and looked around . His cheekbone had stopped bleeding , but the skin was raw and bright red against the black . " What you want ? " he asked . " Cool it , bro . I ai n't gon na do nothing . I just want me a little information . " " I know nothing . " " All I wan na know is where that little bird has her pad . Man , you must know that . " " I do n't know who you 're talking about . " Ralph had a suspicion , but he wanted to confirm it . " For sure you do , man . That pigeon works up the hill with the Frenchy . He calls her Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind raced amongp219the various possibilities , and finally he smiled . " Oh , her , " he said . " Of course . She is right behind the yard where the nets dry . A burlap curtain is on the door . You can not miss it . " Thank you , bro , " Simmons said . " I 'll do the same for you someday . " He had no trouble finding the shack , and he unslung his gun and pulled the curtain aside and went in . There was a flurry in the darkness , and he had a glimpse of bare white buttocks , and then saw Ferguson dive off the bed and reach for his holster . Emilie screamed and struck out at Ferguson with something , and then Ferguson had his gun out and was firing . His first shot hit Simmons in the chest like a hammer , and Simmons ' last sensations were the sound of Emilie 's screams and the crash and impact of the second shot . He did n't hear the other four , although they all hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they grabbed their machine guns and raced toward the docks . They saw Emilie vanish between two shacks , and when they reached the net-drying yard they saw Ferguson rolling Simmons ' body out of the shack . Ferguson had his pistol in one hand , and was fully dressed except for his gun belt and cap . He looked up as the two men approached , and his face was white with fury . " The son of a bitch tried to shoot me , " he said , letting Simmons ' body flop in the dust . He reached through the curtain and brought out the dirty machine gun , and dropped it on the ground . " Pulled the gun on me , and was going to let me have it . " Bromley and Stackpole glanced at each other , and then were aware that Ferguson was staring at them , daring them to ask a question . Neither man said ap220thing , and Ferguson said , " Take him off and bury him . " Stackpole hesitated . " Should n't we tell the Captain  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said take him off and bury him ! " he shouted , and then turned and went inside . He saw the knife that had dropped from Emilie 's hand when she fled , and as he hooked on his gun belt he wondered what she 'd been doing with it . Maybe the black bastard saved me from some trouble , he thought . It might just be that he did me a favor . I guess that 's the way it goes  --  you get unexpected favors from the least likely sources . He put a new clip in his pistol , dropped it in its holster , and after checking to make sure he was properly buttoned , he put on his cap at a jaunty angle and went outside . Ensign Tuttle , followed by Lamb and Andersen , had been approaching the settlement when Ferguson 's shots rang out . Tuttle was carrying a submachine gun , while the two enlisted men held six trussed and complaining chickensapiece . All three men were tired and jumpy , and Tuttle'sface was beginning to take on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shots he shouted , " Forward , men ! Someone 's in trouble ! " and broke into a run . Lamb and Andersen followed at an ungainly canter , their captive chickens squawking in frantic outrage . When they reached the settlement , they saw furtive faces peering from the black interiors of huts , but the street was deserted until they rounded a corner by the docks and saw Bromley and Stackpole standing uncertainlyover what was obviously a dead body . It was in a flat and awkward position that no sleeping or wounded man would take , and its stillness was so absolute as to be hyp/notic . Ferguson was emerging from a nearby hut , and he said something to Bromley and Stackpole that Tuttle could n't hear . Then he looked around and saw Tuttle and his men approaching , and his face hardened . " What are you doing here ? " he asked , as Tuttle came to a panting stop . " Where 'd you get the chickens ? " " We heard the shots , " Tuttle replied . He wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We thought someone was in trouble . " " I said where did you get the chickens ? " Ferguson repeated , angry that Tuttle had come up with something he had n't . " You were supposed to be looking for fuel . " " We could n't find any fuel , and we  --  hey ! " Tuttle stopped as he realized that the body on the ground was Simmons , and not a native as he 'd originally assumed . " What happened to Simmons ? Who shot him ? " " I did , " said Ferguson . " He came at me with a gun . " Bromley started to say , " Unloaded , " but Stackpole trod on his foot , and both men watched silently as Tuttle approachedFerguson , his eyes bulging in disbelief and his face , already red from running , turning a mottled purple . " Why , you bastard ! " Tuttle cried . " You no-good , murderingbastard ! " " Do n't get your tits in a flurry , " Ferguson replied . " I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to a superior . " " What do you mean , he came at you first ? " Tuttle demanded , his face now a few inches from Ferguson 's . " Are you trying to tell me he chased you down the street with a gun ? Do n't try to give me that crap , because I do n't believe it ! " " He did n't chase me down the street , " said Ferguson ,  |p222his  face beginning to redden . " I was walking down the street , and he poked the gun out this door and tried to ambush me . And I told you , watch out how you talk ! " " I do n't believe a goddam word you say ! " Tuttle shouted , and blew a spray of saliva in Ferguson 's eyes . " That 's what I think of what you say ! " " Why , you little prick ! " Ferguson reached for his gun , but before he could get it out of the holster , Tuttle brought the butt of his machine gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled over . Tuttle dropped the machine gun and jumped on Ferguson , and the two men toppled to the ground and rolled in the dust , each trying for a firm grip on the .45 . The four enlisted men , two of them with their hands full of by-now-exhausted chickens , watched in stunned silence the spectacle of two officers fighting in the dust . They had heard officers snap at each other before and make remarks behind each other 's backs , but they had never seen them come to blows . Such a thing was one of the cardinal sins of the rule book , and in his wildest dreams nobody had ever expected to see it happen . They watched now , part fascinatedand part embarrassed , and finally Stackpole said , " I suppose we ought to break it up . " " Let 's see who starts to win , " Bromley suggested . " If Ferguson starts , then we break it up . If Tuttle starts , let him do it . " " All right , " said Stackpole . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take Mr. Tuttle , " Lamb said . " I think he 's gone out of his mind . " Stackpole glanced down at the grunting officers and saw that Tuttle , who was younger than Ferguson and had keptp223himself in better condition , had secured possession of the .45 and was trying to bring it around into Ferguson 's face . Stackpole leaned over and said , " Do n't shoot him , Mr. Tuttle . Better hit him with it on the side of the head . That way you wo n't be up on a murder rap . " " Oh , Lordy ! " Bromley said , suddenly , in a high voice . " Knock it off , sirs ! Here comes the Captain ! "  |p224WHEN  EVERS REACHED THE SHORE , after leaving Pablo tied to a tree , he sat down for a moment to catch his breath , and to try to figure out what was happening . There had been sporadic bursts of firing , but he could n't tell who was doing it or where the shots came from ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men from the Icarus , or both . God alone knew what was going on , or who the green-clad men were , or what they were up to ; the only thing that was certain was that the day was likely to end in a free-for-all if something was n't done to reverse the trend . When he 'd sent his men off to forage , he had apparently pulled the stopper on a bottle containing a djinn of monumental proportions , one that was still seeping out and covering the isTheWake of the Icarus ) land like marsh gas . Everything was going wrong , and the possibilities of complete disaster were multiplied by the arrival of the guerrillas  --  if that 's what they were  --  who were on some mission of their own . He tried to think what the olive-green fatigues signified , and all he could remember were newspaper accounts of uniformed Venezuelan guerrillaswho called themselves the Armed Forces of National Liberation and who raided villages for arms and ammunitionand supplies . It seemed unlikely that Venezuelans would be on this island  --  and , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuban-trained troops , who . . . Well , the hell with it . They probably tied in with Grimond , who himself was enough of an enigma . The only thing that stood out clearly was that nothing good was likely to happen . With that fact accepted , he could try not to be surprised by anything . And try not to panic . His first surprise came as he headed toward the settlement . In the grass to the side of the path ahead , he saw something dark and long ; it looked at first like a log , but then he knew it was n't a log because he saw the sole of a foot , grey and dirty and wrinkled , and as he got closer he saw a hand . Then he saw the whole body , and it was the old man whose chickens had been taken . His eyes were flat and muddy , and there were several red holes in him , and a line of ants was crawling slowly up his chin and into his mouth . The gun he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Evers picked it up and slung it on his shoulder alongside Pablo 's gun . He stared dumbly at the body , thinking he should bury it but not having anything to dig with , and he was still staring , in a state of suspended animation , when he heard shots coming from the distance ahead . These were not machine-gun shots ; they were more widelyp226spaced , and first there were two , followed by four more . This probably meant Ferguson and his .45 , but by this time Evers had resigned himself to the fact that everybody was going to be shooting , and he remembered his resolve not to panic . All right , he thought . So Ferguson 's finally got around to using his weapon . I 'd have figured him to have been among the first , but it does n't really matter when he does it . It 's what he 's shooting at that counts , so I guess the next thing is to find out what that is . We can take care of the old man later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood of resignation interested him , and he wondered why he should be detached when things were going to hell so much faster than he 'd feared . I guess it 's just that I 've imposed sanity over emotion , he thought ; I 'm in the enviable position of being able to look at things rationallyand not get upset . It 's a nice trick , when you can do it . He slung one gun on each shoulder and , feeling something like a guerrilla himself , started off for the settlement . The cluster of metal and tarpaper shacks came into view , and then the dusty street that ran between them , and then he saw a crowd of people looking at something on the ground . At first he thought they were only natives , but then he saw some of his own men , and whatever they were looking at was thrashing about and raising clouds of dust . In spite of his resolution to stay calm , Evers broke into a run , and people saw him coming and opened up to let him through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were the two officers of the Icarus ; Tuttle was on top of Ferguson and was trying to wrench the .45 out of his hand , while Ferguson clawed at Tuttle 's face and throat . His teeth were bared , and his jaws clenched , and the veins in his facep227seemed about to burst . Both men were covered with dirt and perspiration , and their breath came in harsh , grunting sobs . " Stop it ! " Evers shouted . " Mr. Tuttle ! Mr. Ferguson ! Stop it this minute ! GIVE ME THAT GUN ! " He stepped in and twisted the pistol from their hands , then kicked at them to separate them . They rolled limply apart . " Get up ! " Evers commanded . " Both of you ! " Ferguson rose to his knees . Breathing in deep gasps , he said , " Captain , I 'm putting Tuttle on report . He called me a bastard , spat in my face , and hit me in the crotch with the butt of his gun . He then jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tuttle said , as he stood up . " Captain , let me  --  " " Is that right ? " Evers interrupted . " Yes , sir , but  --  " " I said is that right ? " " Yes , sir . " Tuttle was weaving back and forth , and his eyes were glassy . " You 're under arrest . " " Captain , you do n't understand ! " Tuttle 's voice rose and cracked . " Mr. Ferguson shot Simmons ! " " It was self-defense , " Ferguson said , quickly . " The son of a bitch tried to ambush me . " Silently , Evers turned and looked around . Only then did he see Simmons ' body lying in the dirt , and it looked so much like that of the old man that he had a sensation of deja vu , and he wiped the back of his hand across his eyes . His stomach contracted , and he turned back to Ferguson . " You did this ? " he asked . " I told you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled a gun on me. "  | " Captain , may I say something ? " Bromley put in . " What ? " said Evers . " Simmons ' gun was n't  --  " " What he means is Simmons ' gun was n't the same as the others , " Stackpole said loudly , grabbing Bromley by the arm . " He must 've got hold of a different kind of gun , or something . " He glared briefly at Bromley , and Bromley glared back . " I do n't want to go into the details , " Evers said . " If anyone has anything to say about it , he can save it for the court-martial . " " Court-martial ? " Ferguson shouted . " What the hell do you mean , court-martial ? When a nigger pulls a gun on me , what am I  --  " " Shut up ! " Evers bellowed , thrusting his face close to Ferguson 's . " One more word and I 'll shoot you myself ! " Suddenly , Ferguson became the embodiment of everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun-slinger , the man who should never have been in charge of anything , and the pile-up of troubles was the result of Ferguson 's faults being given free rein . Even if he had n't done everything , he epitomized the trouble . Evers had Ferguson 's gun in his hand , and had developed an almost irresistible urge to use it . His rage was such that his head ached again , and the sour taste returned to his mouth . " Not one more word ! " he repeated , hoarsely . " You shut your Goddamnedmouth , and do n't open it again until you 're told to ! " " Captain , I think you ought to look at Mr. Tuttle , " Stackpole said . " I think he 's sick . " Evers looked , and saw that Tuttle had sunk onto thep229ground . His eyes were closed , his face was heavily flushed , and his breathing was labored . Evers kneeled down to take his pulse , and Tuttle 's skin literally burned to the touch . " Sunstroke , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all we need . " " He was acting kinda funny all morning , " Lamb said . " Like he 'd blew his wig , or something . " " We 've got to get him inside , " said Evers . " He 'll bake his brains out here . " " If we can put these chickens down , we can carry him , " Andersen said . " I feel like I 'm growing feathers anyway . " For the first time , Evers noticed the chickens with which Andersen and Lamb were festooned . " I heard about those , " he said . " What happened ? " " We got ' em from some old gook the other side of town . Mr. Tuttle tried to give him a chit for ' em , but he was n't having none of it . " " Who killed him ? " Andersen paused . " Mr. Tuttle did , " he said . " We left the gook and then he come back at us with a gun , and Mr. Tuttle had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank God he missed . This was real self-defense , and no shit . " Evers stood up . " All right , " he said . " Let the chickens go . " Andersen and Lamb gratefully set their clucking burdenon the ground , and Evers saw that each man had been carrying three in each hand , making a total of twelve . Rememberingthe old man 's claim , he said , " How many were there in all ? " " This is the lot , " Andersen replied , flapping his hands to restore circulation . " This was all he had . " Evers eyed the silent ring of natives , and all he could seep230was curiosity mixed with bleak hostility . Nobody said anythingand nobody moved , but he felt surrounded by a ring of spears . " Let 's get moving , " he said . " Andersen and Lamb , you carry Mr. Tuttle . Bromley and Stackpole , you take Simmons . You  --  " he indicated Ferguson with the muzzle of the .45  --  " you walk ahead of me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . His face , under the layer of dirt , was pale , and his eyes were like small , glistening nails . " It 's O.K. if Tuttle shoots a gook , but if I  --  " " You 're not to talk unless spoken to , " Evers cut in . He gestured with the pistol . " Get going . " Ferguson clenched his jaws , put his hands on top of his head in an elaborate parody of the prisoner-of-war gesture , and started off . Evers opened his mouth to say something , then decided the hell with it . If that 's the way he wants to play it , that 's all right with me . Andersen and Lamb had no trouble getting Tuttle to his feet because he was n't completely unconscious , but Bromleyand Stackpole had a difficult time with Simmons . Neitherof them had ever carried a dead body before , and he kept slipping out of their grasp . Finally , after trying several methods , they got him slung between them , and followed the procession up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished , and with them had gone the chickens . As they approached Grimond 's house , they saw , coming in from another direction , Proxmeyer and Latch staggering under the weight of an enormous sheep lashed to a pole . Bogardus , carrying the machine gun , followed behind , and he waved the gun in greeting . " Look what we got ! " hep231shouted . " I thought we were gon na need a truck to get it back here ! " Evers realized that this must have been the first shots he 'd heard ; the animal 's head was a red pulp but it was no longer bleeding , and it had clearly taken the men a long time to bring it back . And it was just as clearly one of Grimond 's sheep , because he came running out of the house waving his arms and shouting in rage . " Au putain de Dieu ! " he shrieked , his voice rising to a scream . " Idiots ! Imbeciles ! Fils des chameaux ! You killed my ram ! " Proxmeyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , we noticed that , " Proxmeyer said , glancing at its limp genitals . " But by that time we 'd already shot him . He 'll taste just as good , though , wo n't he ? " " He was my stud ! He was for breeding ! Without him there is no flock ! " Proxmeyer was quiet for a few seconds , and then he said , " Well , I 'll be dipped in shit and rolled in breadcrumbs . I 'm sorry . " " How were we to know ? " Latch put in . " He looked like any other sheep to us . " " He was all alone in this field , " Bogardus said . " He did n't look like he belonged to anybody . " All right , Evers thought . This is where we stop it . Before the whole island blows up , we put an end to this . " Who shot him ? " he asked . There was a silence , and then Proxmeyer said , " I did . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Evers said . " Andbe glad I did n't knock you down to Seaman . " Proxmeyer'sjaw fell open , and Evers turned to Bogardus . " You werep232leading petty officer , " he said . " It 's obvious you ca n't handle the responsibility of First Class . You are now TechnicianSecond . " " Jesus , Captain , " Bogardus began , but Evers turned to Latch , who was swaying slightly on his feet . " And you , " Evers said , " were a part of it . I 'm giving you two hundred hours extra duty . I 'll make all these punishmentsofficial later . " Grimond had regained his composure . " Commandant , they did not know , " he said . " It was a mistake . " " It certainly was , " Evers replied . " And it 's a mistake they wo n't make twice . You think I 'm afraid of being disliked , I 'll show you a thing or two . Bogardus , give me that gun . Hesitantly , his face white and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evers ' hands . He started to say something , then stopped . " Now bury that ram , " Evers said . " Bury it ? " Bogardus said , astonished . " What for ? " " Because I tell you to . Get cracking . " " But , Captain  --  " " Bogardus , I 've already reduced you in rate once . I can keep this up as long as you can . " " Yes , sir . " Bogardus turned , and motioned to Proxmeyerand Latch to pick up the animal . Then he looked back at Evers and , in a voice that was flat and toneless with hatred , said , " Where do you want it buried ? " " By that clump of bushes near the tree , " Evers said , pointing . " And do n't just shovel earth over it ; bury it deep enough so nothing can get at it . " " What do I dig with ? " Bogardus asked . He did n't say it , but his tone implied " My hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shovel somewhere . Proxmeyer and Latch can carry the ram over there while you look for a shovel . " Grimond made one more try . " Captain , " he said , " if you are seriously interested in gathering food  --  " " What I 'm interested in is no concern of yours , " said Evers . " That ram would be inedible , and you know it as well as I do . " " Not wholly , " said Grimond . " There are ways of cookingit . " " If you do n't mind , I 'll be the one who decides . You told me not to be afraid to be a bastard , and I 'm taking your advice . " " You are indeed . I 'm not sure I meant it quite this way . " " That , " said Evers , " is too bad . " He was about to say something more when he saw Simmons ' body lying where Bromley and Stackpole had set it down . " Mr. Ferguson , " he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to bury what they killed ; I suggest you do the same . Go find a shovel , dig a grave for Simmons , and let me know when it 's done . " At first it seemed as though Ferguson had n't heard him . Then , very quietly , he said , " I 'll be God-damned if I will . " " You 'll do as you 're told . That 's a direct order . " " You ca n't make me . " Evers ' throat began to tighten , and his breath came faster . " Mr. Ferguson , " he said , " you are already going to be court-martialed for murder . If you want , I 'll add mutiny to the charges . " " You 'll never make it stick . " " Then put it this way . I would be happy to shoot youp234right now , and there is n't one man here who would n't swear I did it in self-defense . " Evers had a submachine gun on either shoulder and the one he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he handed to Grimond , and he cocked the .45 he held in his right . " You think so ? " Ferguson said , with a warped smile . " You think they 'd all be with you ? " " Try me . If you think I 'm kidding , just try me . I said get a shovel and dig a grave for Simmons . I 'll count to three . " He raised the pistol . " One  --  two  --  " Ferguson whirled around and stalked after Bogardus , who had gone to the outbuilding . Evers lowered the pistol , and flicked it onto safety . He turned to Andersen and Lamb , who were still holding Tuttle between them . " Take him inside and put him to bed , " he said , and then , to Grimond , " if that 's all right with you . " " I seem to have very little to say here , " Grimond replied . He handed the submachine gun back to Evers and added , " I think you may need this more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol shots , he looked cautiously out the door of the Jolly Roger and saw the two men who 'd been with Ferguson running down the street with their machine guns . They 'd left his fuel drum by the side of the road , and after making sure they were out of sight , he tilted the drum on its rim and rolled it up the walk into his tavern . Then he opened the trap door to the roof cellar , threw a line around the center of the drum , and tipped it over and lowered it slowly into the darkness below . He tossed the line after it , lighted an oil lantern , and backed down the ladder , closing the trap door over his head . In the cellar , he set his lantern on the battered woodenp236table , unhitched the line and rolled the drum to one side , and then , after coiling the line neatly , he reached into a tin box in the shadows and brought out a sticky patch of spider web , which he applied to the wound on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flesh , he heard footsteps pounding on the floor above  --  someone barefoot was running through the tavern  --  and then he heard Emilie'svoice frantically calling his name . He sprang up the ladder and opened the trap door , and heard Emilie scream . " Oh , it 's you ! " she said , as Ralph 's face appeared above the opening . " I thought it was one of them . " " Come down , " Ralph said . " Tell me about it . " Emilie scrambled down the ladder , and collapsed in the chair . " By God , " she said . " What a day this is been ! " " I see the charm was good , " Ralph said . Emilie glanced at him . " How do you know ? " " Two men come here , asking where you live . Why else they do that , but for the charm ? " Emilie pondered this , and said , " You must be right . But you did n't have to make it work so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What happened ? " Emilie took a deep breath . " Well , Ferguson came , just like you said he would . He came , and I had him where I wanted him . I had the knife , ready to nip off his zobbes , when in comes that other man , and all hell breaks loose . Ferguson shoots him once , which most likely kills him , then shoots him again , which surely kills him , then shoots him several more times , just for good luck . To me , it looked like he just liked to shoot . " " What did you do ? " " I take one cut at him with my knife , but now it 's too late , so with him shooting like that I do n't want no part ofp237that place . So I grab my dress and run out . He does n't even see me , he 's so busy shooting . " " You see anything else ? " " I see some more men with machine guns , but I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with that crew . " " Say , girl . You tell me yesterday there are fifteen Yankeesand only one gun , and now every Yankee I see has either pistol or machine gun . What happen ? " Emilie thought for a moment , then said , " All I can think is they got those guns from the storehouse . There 's boxes of guns for the Revolution there , and they must have found them and stole them . " Ralph 's eyelids lowered . " How many guns ? " " Two big boxes . Fifty , maybe , or sixty . I do n't know . " " It would be nice if we could get them . " " How ? " " I have an idea . I think you can help . " Emilie 's blue eyes grew round , and reflected the light of the lantern . " What do I do ? " " You keep the Yankees busy . You go up the hill as though to another day of work , and you give them something to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Suppose Ferguson is there , what do I do then ? " " I do n't think Mr. Ferguson will give you trouble . You know enough about him so he will not open his mouth . " " He thinks he is a great lover . " Emilie spat on the dirt floor . " I know tree frogs who are better lovers than that . " Ralph looked at her with interest . " What kind of tree frogs ? " " The usual kind . The ones you hear at night . " A faraway look came into Ralph 's eyes . " Many people miss a great deal , " he said.  | " Like what ? " Emilie was only half listening , wondering how she could divert the attention of fourteen men . By making love only to opposite sex of their own species . They have no idea how wide and beautiful the world is . " I would n't know about that . I have n't had the chance to look around . " " Beauty is all about ! " Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even have to move to find it ! " Emilie looked at him sourly . " It has been a long day already , " she said . " Do n't tell me you have something in mind . " " Be not foolish , girl . You are only woman . " " For a lot of people , that only ' is enough . " " That 's why I think we may be able to trick these Yankees . From what I hear , they tend to couple with the woman only , but that in great profusion . Even to excess . " " Are you suggesting that I couple with fourteen men ? " Emilie said , incredulous . " I have n't done that since I was a girl ! " " I do not suggest that . But if you could make the hint , make them believe there was something just around the corner , it might hold their attention for a long enough time . " " That , if you will excuse me , is the worst advice I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to girls having their throats cut . " As an afterthought , she added , " To say nothing of being raped . " " I am not expert on these details , " Ralph said . " As I say , that is up to you . " He paused , then said , " About those tree frogs  --  "  | " I have an idea , " Emilie cut in . " It may not work , but it 'll be worth a try . Do you have something to mark my body ? " " I have several things , depending on what kind of mark you want . " " If I had a mark , like a tattoo , that started where one could see it  --  " she indicated the area near her collar bone  --  " and then went under my dress and perhaps in and out a bit , it might be something to get their attention . I can make up a story to go with it . " Ralph closed his eyes , and smiled . " Like , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Emilie . " That would be good . Do you have a good story I could make up about a snake ? " " We can think of one . Take off your dress . " Emilie slipped out of her dress , wondering briefly why she ever bothered to put it on , and Ralph produced tins of different colored powder . Then from a mason jar he poured a splash of clear fluid into a scallop shell , and began to mix in some powder . The powder was yellowish to start with , but turned blue in the fluid . Emilie folded her arms under her breasts , and hugged herself . " It 's cold down here , " she said . " You will be warm in a few minutes , " Ralph replied , adding more powder . " This mixture makes some heat . " " I 'm not sure I like the sound of that . I know lots of better ways to get warm . " " I have never had any complaints . This mixture has cured the ague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also nice to look at . They will not be able to keep their eyes off you . "  | " Well , I guess that 's something . " " You must tell me more about those tree frogs some time . It sounds like an experience of great charm . " " I was just making talk  --  there really is n't much to tell . " " Let me judge that . " Sitting in the chair , he moved her around so that she was in front of him , facing both him and the lantern . " Now , hold still . " Whistling softly , he began to sketch in the head of a cobra in the center of her chest . " That tickles , " Emilie said , squirming . " This is nothing , " Ralph replied , applying color with a chicken feather . " Wait until I get along , then you will know what tickle really means . " " All I can say is this had better work . " " It will . Have no fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , not conversationally , but almost in a sort of chant , and his accent became thicker and more African than Jamaican . " The cobra is the king of all the snakes , " he said . " In the deep and blackest jungles of India and of Africa , there is no one who dare stand up against the cobra . Even the mongoose  --  " he sketched the line of the snake 's body down between Emilie 's breasts , and she shuddered  --  " even the mongoose , who on the open ground will dare to fight , even he will not stand up against the cobra in the jungle . There are priestesses who kiss the cobra on the head  --  three times they kiss him , and three times they give him only air to strike  --  and even they will not go near him in the jungle , because there he is the king . Turn , please . " He turned Emilie slightly to the right , and brought the snake 's body across the ribs on her left side . Shading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a cobra , a king among the kings , who weary of the jungle ,  |p241and  weary of the darkness and the damp , and think to pass his days among the hills , where he can see the sun . So he kiss his friend goodbye  --  " " What friend ? " said Emilie . " What kind of friends do cobras have ? " " Another cobra . Do n't interrupt . Turn a little more , please . " He eased her around , and brought the snake 's body into the small of her back . " This is interesting scar , " he said . " How do you get that ? " " A knife , " she replied . " I forgot it was there . " " Forgot it was where ? " " In the bed . " Ralph clucked his tongue , and dipped the feather in the dye mixture . " So he kiss his friend goodbye , " he continued , " and slither out and leave the jungle far behind . He come upon a lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie the hills ? I am king of all the snakes , and I would live among the hills . ' And the lion say to him , You may be king of all the snakes , but I am king of all the beasts , so do not ask me where to find the hills . Ask some lesser beast , and he will tell you of the hills . ' So the cobra bite the lion on the lip , and leave him there to die . Now you may turn . Does it feel too hot ? " " No , " Emilie replied . " It feels just about right . " " Good . " With Emilie facing him , Ralph contemplated the prospects , and decided on a small embellishment . He sketched the line of the snake 's body across her middle abdomen , then looped it up and around her navel , and brought it across her left hip . " That should give them food for thought , " he said , and started on the scales . " So then what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobra meet a tiger . And to this beast thep242cobra say , Which way lie the hills ? I am king of all the snakes , and I would live among the hills . ' To which the tiger answer , I have seen many snakes before , but never one with such a flattened head as yours . A flattened head like that must make you stupid , and for stupid snakes I have no time . Please slither off , and let me rest in peace . ' So the cobra bite the tiger on the ear , and leave him there to die . " Ralph turned Emilie further to the right , and said , " This may tickle a bit , " and then drew the line down and across her left buttock . " Just keep talking , " Emilie said , biting her lower lip . " If you keep on talking , I wo n't mind . " " So then the cobra meet with a giraffe , " Ralph went on , intent upon his work . " And to this giraffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am king of all the snakes , and I would live among the hills . And before you say a word , I should warn you that the lion and the tiger now lie dead , because they would not tell . ' This make the giraffe afraid , and he say , I would tell you if I knew , but I live where the land is flat , and I know not of the hills . ' So the cobra bite the giraffe upon the foot , and leave him there to die . " " Why , the son of a bitch ! " Emilie exclaimed . " He 's as bad as Ferguson . " " When the cobra want something , he intend to get it , " Ralph replied . " That is why he king of all the snakes . Now turn back , please . " He swung Emilie so she was facing him again , and said , " Hold your breath , " and drew the tail of the snake appearing on the inside of her right leg , tapering off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After shading it in , he said , " Now you may relax , " and stood back and surveyedhis work . He nodded . " Rather good , " he said . " It should keep them interested for hours . "  | " What happened to the cobra ? " Emilie asked . " The cobra ? " Ralph thought a moment , then said , " The next animal he meet was mongoose . " " And ? " " This is not the jungle , so of course the mongoose win . " " Is there a moral to the story ? " After a second 's thought , Ralph said , " Yes . If you king in the jungle , better not try for the hills as well . " " That 's a good moral , " Emilie said . " Do you think the Yankees will get it ? " " Most likely not . But at least you will keep their inter-est . " Emilie glanced down at herself . " I never thought I 'd have to wear a snake to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footsteps overhead , and she started and looked up . " Maybe that 's Ferguson ! " " No , " said Ralph . " I know the step . That is the man who comes looking for Mister Paul . " He glanced at the ladder , and saw that the trap door had been left open , and the man was staring down at them in wide-eyed amazement . " Good afternoon , " Ralph said . " May we help you ? " The man watched as Emilie slipped hurriedly into her dress , and then he swallowed . " Uh , yes , " he said , and came down the ladder . He moved clumsily because he had replaced his belt with a long piece of vine , and the trousers of his fatigues kept slipping . He continued to look at Emilie , and she straightened her dress and returned his stare . " Good day , " she said , defiantly . " I do n't think we 've met , " the man said , staring at the fragment of cobra 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My name is Emilie . What 's yours ? "  | " Emilie ? You are the one who  --  up the hill ? Grimond ? " " Yes . Who are you ? " " My name is Ernesto . We 've been waiting to hear from you . " Emilie paused , glanced at Ralph , then said , " I could n't . I broke  --  " " Just a minute . " Ernesto held up his hand and , indicating Ralph , said , " Is he  --  is he  --  " " I am not one of the Army of Liberation , " Ralph put in . " But if you are working against the Yankees , I will do my best to help . " He touched the wound on his cheek . " You tell me , and I will do it . " To Emilie , Ernesto said , " What happened ? " " I broke the radio , " she replied . " The Yankees wanted to send a message , so I broke it . " " Where are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All over , perhaps . Did you look at the house ? " " We scouted around . They have three men guarding their boat . We caught another , but  --  " he spat  --  " he got away . " Emilie 's eyes brightened with excitement . " What did he look like ? Was he  --  " " He was tall and lean and had dark eyebrows . He talked like a borracho , but it was a trick . " " That sounds like their Captain , but he talks all right . " " So did this man . I wanted to shoot him there , but our gallant leader  --  our new genius  --  said no , we 'll just tie him up and let Pablo guard him . " He hitched up his trousers , and muttered in Spanish . Then , to Ralph , he said , " Did I interrupt something , corn padre ? You seemed busy when I arrived . " " It was an idea we had , " Ralph replied , and outlined thep245plan he and Emilie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " No , no , no , no , no , " he said . " Never in a million years . They will simply rape her and throw her aside , and you will be no nearer the guns than before . " " I had wondered about that , " Emilie said . " But I thought if I told a story that was interesting enough  --  " " Not in a million years , " Ernesto repeated . " These men are from the military , so their minds run in military lines . if you can not beat them in a military way , then you at least pretend to be military , and that will keep their attention . If you try a  --  " he gestured at Emilie  --  " a ruse like this , it will get you nowhere . " " How does a man pretend to be military ? " Ralph asked . " Make a lot of noise . The best thing is to wait until night , when they are all back at the house , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a small attack , but not a serious one . If you kill any of them , so much the better , but you will hold their attention and perhaps even lure them out to attack you . Then , while they are busy being military , others can slip in and take away the guns . Corn prende ? " " It sounds reasonable , " Ralph said . " How about putting a curse on them ? " Emilie suggested , and to Ernesto she explained , " Ralph makes very strong medicine . Sometimes almost too strong . " " I have tried one curse already , " Ralph admitted . " It may have worked or it may not , I have no way to know . " " Do as you wish . But the best plan is the one I have outlined . " " And that you will do tonight ? " Ernesto hesitated . " I hope so , " he said . " The leaderp246must still make the final decision . The leader  --  Well , no matter . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The leader is  --  Put it this way : I am disappointed . He is new , and he wears a beret like Che 's , but it takes more than a beret to make a man a genius . " " I wore a beret once , " Ralph said . " I was told it was not becoming . " " It is not for everybody , " Ernesto agreed . Then he looked at Emilie . " About this snake , " he said . " Would you mind showing me how you were going to display it to the Yankees ? " Emilie gave him a level stare . " For free ? " she said . " Were you going to charge them money ? " " I was going to do it for the Revolution . " " Then do it for the Revolution now . " She sighed , and shook her dress to loosen it . " Once upon a time there was a cobra  --  " she began , and then stopped , as footsteps and voices sounded above . Two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were Americans . Ernesto reached under his shirt and produced a pistol . " Put out the light , " he said , quietly.  |p247WHEN  ENSIGN TUTTLE had been laid on Grimond 's bed and the shutters closed , Evers dropped into a chair in the living room and put his head in his hands . Reviewing his situation , he could tick off the following items : He had one officer down with a sunstroke , and another officer up for court-martial and in a mood bordering on mutiny ; he had one dead man in the process of being buried , and three men under discipline and quivering with resentment . Of the food that had been found , part was now being buried and the rest had been released , and as for the fuel . . . He raised his head , and looked at Bromley and Stackpole , who were sitting on the floor with their backs against the wall . " Did anybody find any fuel ? " he asked . ( Nathaniel BenchleyStackpole 's jaw dropped open , and he looked at Bromley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean forgot . " " Did you find some ? " " Yessir . A fifty-gallon drum . " " Where ? " " There 's this dump called the Jolly Roger Tavern . Run by some gook who looks like a big grasshopper . We got the drum unhitched and were just about to bring it here when we heard the shots  --  Mr. Ferguson 's shots , down  --  when he shot Simmons . We went to see what was happening , and then we  --  ah  --  kinda forgot about the fuel . " " Then maybe you 'd better go back and get it . " A thin ray of hope cut the darkness ; perhaps the day was n't going to be a total loss , after all . " Yessir . " The men got wearily to their feet , and Stackpolesaid , " You want the whole fifty-gallon drum ? It 's a bitch to lug around . " " We wo n't need anything like that . See if you can just borrow a couple of gallons . " " Just borrow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for his machine gun , and slung it over his shoulder . Bromley took his , checked the safety catch , and sighted experimentally along the barrel . " And leave your guns here , " Evers said . " There 'll be no need for them . " Stackpole looked at him , incredulous , and said , " But , Captain , that gook that runs the place  --  " " I said you wo n't need your guns , " Evers repeated . " There 's been entirely too much shooting already . " Stackpole shrugged , and set his gun against the wall . " It 's O.K. by me , " he said . " I just hope he do n't have chums . "  | " What do you mean by that ? " " Well , sir , Mr. Ferguson kinda beat him up , and he do n't feel too friendly toward Americans right now . " Evers stared up at the ceiling . " Oh , God , " he said . " All right , take a gun , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to threaten with . Keep it slung on your shoulder unless you 're attacked . " Stackpole hesitated , then said , " Aye , aye , sir , " and picked up the gun again . " Come on , " he said , to Bromley . " Let 's shove . " When they got outside , Bromley said , " I think the Old Man 's blown his mind . " " Let 's hope not , " Stackpole replied . " That would put Ferguson in charge . " " Like hell it would . Ferguson 's under arrest . " " That wo n't mean nothing if the Old Man craps out . That 's the order of rank , and that 's how it goes . " Bromley sighed . " Listen , " he said . " How come you shut me up about Simmons ' gun ? When I started to say it was unloaded , you jumped on me . Why should n't I say it ? " " Because I want that bastard to hang himself . I want him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to the court-martial we can step in and trip him up . The more he knows we know , the less he 's gon na lie . " " I never thought of that . " " Just for instance , how was he dressed the first time we saw him ? When he rolled old Simmons outa that hut . " " He was dressed all right . " " Did he have his gun belt , or his hat ? " " Now you mention it , I guess not . " " But he did later . " " Yeah . " Bromley chewed on this thought for a while ,  |p250then  said , " I 'll be damn . " They walked a way in silence . " Why the hell are we here ? " Bromley said , at last . " Are you crazy ? We 're shipwrecked . " " I know that . I mean the big picture . What are we do-ing ? " " Do n't look at me  --  I did n't cut the orders . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't feel like I 'm defending anything . Right now , I feel kinda stupid . " Stackpole shrugged . " That 's your bag . Me , I do n't worry about such things . I do what I 'm told , and hope someday I 'll make Chief . " " My old man insisted I join the Navy , " Bromley said , looking into the distance . " Or the Army , or the Marines . I could of had a student deferment , but my old man said not on your life . Every man 's got ta serve his country , he said . That 's the only thing that 'll make a man outa you . " " What was he in ? " " Nothing . He was too young for the First War , and they would n't take him in the Second . I think it kinda bugs him . " " Why would n't they take him ? " " Asthma . But you 'd think they 'd told him he did n't have balls or something , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta have balls . Look at you . " " I know , and I 'm not the only one . All over town he 's proved he 's got balls until it 's like to drive my old lady nuts , but still it worries him he has n't got an old uniform to dress up in . It like to kill him every time his friends get dressed up Memorial Day . Every Memorial Day he gets drunk , then goes out and lays anything that walks . As I say , it like to drive my old lady nuts . "  | " There must be a lot of laughs around your house . " " It 's not so bad . He 's got a mess of guns , and sometimes he and I go hunting . " " What 's your old lady do ? " " Same old thing . Housework . " " She must get a big bang out of life . " Bromley was silent briefly , and then said , " You know , I 've been thinking , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of horse 's ass , or something . " " It sounds that way . " " I never really thought about it before , but now I spell it out he really is . I think I 'll talk to him about it when I get home . " " I would n't , unless you 're a lot bigger'n he is . Or better with a gun . " " Most of the time he 's pretty nice . But he really is a horse 's ass . " Bromley paused , then added , " It 's funny to realize a thing like that , all of a sudden . It makes you look at everything kinda different . " They approached the settlement , and as they walked down the deserted street , they could see that the fuel drum was not where they 'd left it . The Jolly Roger appeared deserted , baking quietly in the sunlight , and waves of heat shimmered above the corrugated roof . " Oh , great , " Stackpole said . " I suppose he 's gone and hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw that the tank was n't there , either ; the unattached fuel line seemed to stare at them like a thin and oily snake . " Now what the hell ? " Bromley said . " Who else woulda wanted it ? " " Let 's look inside . " Stackpole led the way around to the front , and they went through the swinging doors andp252waited for a moment until their eyes became accustomed to the gloom . As far as they could see , the tavern was empty . " This must be some jumping joint , " Bromley said , regardingthe silent jukebox . " Can you imagine coming here for your jollies on Saturday night ? " " I can imagine almost anything , " Stackpole replied . " Except where that goddam fuel drum coulda gone . " He went into the kitchen , and said , " Hey . Look here . " He pointed to the open trap door and the darkened cellar below , and then he said , " JESUS ! " and jumped back , trying to unsling his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice from the cellar , and a man holding a pistol started up the ladder . Stackpole was frozen against the wall , unable to use his gun , but Bromley was the other side of the opening , and he leaped forward and slammed the trap door closed on the man 's head . There was a shout from below , and the sound of falling . " Quick ! " said Bromley , standing on the trap door . " Drag that table over here ! " Stackpole pulled the heavy kitchen table on top of the door , and the two men turned and ran from the tavern . " Let 's bug outa here ! " Stackpole said , heading for the path to Grimond 's house . " Who was it ? " Bromley asked , as they ran . " Did you get a look at him ? " " He looked like Castro , with a beard and a uniform . " Stackpole had unslung his gun so as to run better , and he cocked it . " He may not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hey , there 's another ! " Bromley shouted , as theyp253rounded a corner and saw a green-clad man in a beret in the street ahead . The man jumped to one side and fired a burst from his submachine gun , and bullets whacked into the houses behind Stackpole and Bromley . Without breakinghis stride , Stackpole returned the fire , but his aim was no better , and bits of wood and dirt flew in the air . The man ducked behind a shack , and Bromley and Stackpole continued at a flat run up the hill . " Where 'd they all come from ? " Bromley gasped . " Are we being invaded , or what ? " " Do n't look at me , " Stackpole replied . " They can have the goddam place for all I care ! " As they neared the house , they passed Ferguson and the three men who were digging graves , and Bromley called to them . " Watch it up , you guys ! " he shouted . " We got in-vaders ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got what ? " Bogardus called back . " Invaders ! " Bromley shrieked . " Guys with guns ! Beards ! " He made a gesture suggestive of a beard , and staggered up the steps of the verandah after Stackpole . " Now , what is that all about ? " Bogardus said . " Why should he blow his wig about a beard ? " " Depends on who 's wearing it , " said Proxmeyer . It had been his turn with the shovel , and he handed it to Latch . " Here , " he said . " Hold this a minute , and I 'll go find out . " " No , you do n't , " said Bogardus . " Nobody leaves this detail until the hole 's been dug . " Proxmeyer glanced into the shallow trench they 'd scooped out of the hard earth . " If you ask me , it 's deep enough now , " he said . " We could roll that old ram in andp254cover him up , and nobody 'd know how deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " Latch put in . " Captain said to bury him real deep . " " Screw the Captain , " Proxmeyer replied . " Screw him in spades in Macy 's window at high noon . Do n't you agree , Mr. Ferguson ? " He grinned at Ferguson , who was furiouslyspading the earth nearby . Ferguson said nothing , and Proxmeyer went on , " It 's no fun being an enlisted man , is it , Mr. Ferguson ? Enlisted men get all the shitty details , do n't they , sir ? " Ferguson 's face , already red , turned purple , and he drew back the spade as though to throw it at Proxmeyer . Bogardusjumped between them . " All right , knock it off , " he said , to Proxmeyer . " You just keep digging , and knock off the crap . " " I was just having a little fun , " said Proxmeyer , still grinning . " You ca n't blame me for wanting some fun , can you ? " " Dig , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , " said Latch . " I just saw something . " " Congratulations , " Bogardus replied . " You should keep a diary . " " I mean it , " Latch said . " In those trees , over there . " They all looked where he pointed , at the line of trees fifty yards away , and he went on , " There 's somebody in there . " " So ? " Bogardus squinted his eyes , but could see nothing . " So I do n't know . There he is again . " " I saw him , " said Proxmeyer . " He ducked behind that big cactus-like thing . " " That 's right . "  |p255There  was a silence while they stared at the large plant , but whoever was behind it stayed hidden . Finally , Bogardussaid , " Maybe we should find out what Bromley was screaming about . We do n't want to get caught bare-assed out here without weapons . " " I 'll go ask , " Proxmeyer said , starting away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You coming , Mr. Ferguson ? " Ferguson continued to dig and said nothing , and Bogardusshrugged . " No skin off my butt , " he muttered , and followed Proxmeyer and Latch to the house . When they got inside , they found everybody standing at the windows . Evers glanced at them , and said , " We were about to call you in . How 's Mr. Ferguson doing ? " " He 's got a ways to go yet , " Bogardus replied . " What 's going on ? " " We 're not sure , " said Evers . " Bromley and Stackpole ran into trouble in the village , and Mr. Grimond has seen people moving through the trees . Stackpole , go look out a back window , and see if you see anything . " " Aye , " said Stackpole , and crossed to the other side of the room . After a moment , he said , " Nothing so far . " " Keep looking , " said Evers . " What kind of trouble did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth open to reply when there came the sound of firing , and those who were watchingFerguson saw puffs of dust explode around his feet . He dropped his spade , and raced toward the house . " Give him cover ! " Evers shouted , and Proxmeyer and Latch grabbed guns and ran onto the verandah and fired long bursts toward the trees . Most of their shots fell short , and by the time they corrected their aim Ferguson clam/bered up the steps and tottered gasping into the house . " Are you all right ? " Evers asked , and Ferguson said nothingand sank into a chair . Proxmeyer and Latch came back into the house , and Proxmeyer said , " These goddam guns 'll hardly reach the trees . You got ta arc your shots like basketballs . " " They 're low muzzle velocity , " Evers replied . " They 're meant for barroom fighting . " To Grimond , he said , " What do you think ? Are we going to be attacked ? " Grimond shrugged . " It looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before night . They would n't cross those open spaces in the daytime . " " All right , then . We 'll arm ourselves as best we can , and wait . " Evers looked out at the landscape , and said , " Oh . . . We ca n't leave Simmons there . " He paused . " Any volunteers ? " Lamb got to his feet . " Come on , Andy , " he said . " We had it easy so far ; it 's time we did a little work . " Andersen rose , flexed his arms , and stood beside Lamb . " Proxmeyer and Latch will cover you , " said Evers . " Get something to carry him in , and put him in the buildingout back . O.K. ? " The men got a blanket and clothesline , and Evers watched with a feeling of complete unreality as they ran across the open ground , bound Simmons ' body in the blanket , and then started back , while Proxmeyer and Latch fired short bursts into the trees beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he was watching some sort of puppet show , and the men involved seemed to have no more nerves than puppets . He knew they must be nervous  --  his mouth was dry , and he felt his throat poundingwhile he waited for something to go wrong  --  but theirp257faces were without expression , and they moved as though they were doing nothing more dangerous than loading supplies . When , after what seemed like an hour , they went around the side of the house and the gunners stopped firing , Evers let out a long breath and found that everyone else had done the same . Everyone , that is , except Ferguson , who had n't moved from the chair in which he 'd dropped . After a few minutes , Lamb and Andersen came back into the room . " Who-o-o-e-e-e ! " said Lamb , collapsing slowly on the floor . " I think I peed my pants , " Andersen said . " I do n't remembernothing about it , but I feel kinda wet . " He plucked at his dungarees , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How are you , mate ? " he asked . " You gon na live ? " " I 'm gon na live to be ninety , " Lamb replied , and closed his eyes . Evers tried to think of something to say , but could come up only with the traditional " Well done . " Then he added , " And thank you . " His eyes still closed , Lamb replied , " My pleasure . " Evers looked around the room and made a head count , and found he still had four people missing : Jackson , who was trying to repair the fuel line , and the three-man boat guard . The boat guard ought to be recalled before dark , but for the moment he was n't going to send anyone else outside . Let them stay where they were , and assume they 'd be able to take care of themselves . Or , rather , pray that they would ; the time had long since passed when he could assume anything.  |p258FOR  THE MEN who had been sent to guard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Pollock , Lassiter , and Grimes , three Seamen nobody had asked for in any other detail , who therefore drew this assignment by default . Pollock , who was senior to the other two by five months , was the one with the machine gun ; Lassiter and Grimes were his assistants , whom he could order about as he chose . All three were still in their teens , and Grimes , who was an ash blond from the hills of Kentucky , had not yet begun to shave . When they first got to the beach , the sun on the white sand almost blinded them , and their main interest was findinga shady place to sit . They tried the lee of the boat , butp259the reflected heat from the sand baked their skin and made them itch , and they had to move around to maintain their sanity . Then Pollock remembered a tarpaulin in one of the rafts , and told Grimes to fetch it while he and Lassiter collected oars , a boathook , and the auxiliary mast from the boat . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow in the ground big enough to hold the three of them , and then made a lashed-up framework over this and coveredthe whole affair with the tarpaulin . Once inside , they had a good view of the boat and the approaches along the beach on both sides . The fact that they might want to see behind as well never occurred to them ; their orders had been to guard the boat . " All right , " Pollock said , when they had completed the shelter . " I 'll lie in the middle , with the gun . " He went in , lay down on his stomach , and propped himself on his elbowswith the gun pointing toward the boat . " You , Lassiter , " he went on , " get on my left  --  uh  --  port side , and keep your eye peeled down the beach to port . Grimes , you look to starboard and sing out the minute you see anything . " The two men joined him as instructed , and there was a certain amount of squirming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not he should cock the gun and decided against it ; there 'd be plenty of time for that if someone was spotted . He aimed along the sights , centering them on the bow of the boat , and squeezed the trigger . " Zap , " he said . " One gook bites the dust . " " How will we know if they 're gooks ? " Grimes asked . " From a distance , it might be anybody . " " Do n't you worry about that , " Pollock assured him . " You just sing out , and leave the rest to me. "  |p260There  was a long silence , and then Grimes shifted his position slightly . " I 'm confused , " he said . Pollock glanced at him . " About what ? " " Is the vagina the outside part and the vulva the inside , or is it the other way round ? " There was a beat of about five , and Lassiter said , " I 'll be damn if I know . I did n't know there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a difference , " Grimes said . " And sombitchif I can remember which . " " Is it important ? " Pollock asked . " Hell yes , man . How 'm I ever gon na score if I do n't know what I 'm talking about ? " Pollock contemplated the beach , and the boat , and the hot blue sky . " Well , as best as I can remember , " he said " it 's the other way round . I would n't swear to it , because the subject never come up in quite those terms . " " You made a lot of scores ? " Grimes asked . Pollock took a deep breath , and spat in the sand . " Enough , " he said . " What was it like first time ? " " If you want to know the truth , I do n't remember . " " You do n't remember ? " " Nope . " Pollock moistened one thumb , and polished the front sight of the gun . " So bagged I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name was Janice . " " I knew a Janice once , in Cleveland , " Lassiter said . " I wonder if it 's the same one . " " This was in Passaic , New Jersey , " Pollock said . " In the back seat of a ' 48 Plymouth . Or so they tell me . " " The Janice I knew had a Dodge , " Lassiter said . " It must be another Janice . "  | " Just how do you make a score ? " Grimes asked . " I mean , what 's the first thing you do ? " Pollock looked at him . " Man , what do they do in your part of the country ? " " Oh , we do some hunting . And I help my old man with the still . " " You got a sister ? " " Sure . But that 's agin the law , ai n't it ? " " Well , at least you know that much . That 's a starter . " " No shit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked at Lassiter . " You got any good ideas ? " Lassiter reached in his hip pocket , and brought out a cracked and soggy wallet . Opening it up , he said , " Did I ever show you the picture of my girl ? " " Probably . Is it going to be any help to old man Grimes , here ? " " Well , it 's on the subject . " Lassiter thumbed through the wallet , which oozed bubbles . " Christ , what a mess , " he said . " I shoulda dried it out when we hit the beach . Here . You ca n't really see much , but that 's what she looks like . " He passed a limp and faded snapshot of a girl in a white bathing suit to Pollock , and Pollock was studying it when they heard the crunch of footsteps close by and a large black figure strode onto the sand from behind them . Pollockdropped the picture , and tugged frantically at the cocking lever of the gun . " Hey ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes there ? " The figure turned around , and they saw Jackson , his eyes large and white . " Hey , man , " he said . " Do n't point that thing at me . " The three men , whose hearts were pounding as though they 'd run a race , relaxed , and Pollock said , " You shouldp262give a cheer when you come up on an outpost like that . You coulda got shot . " " I did n't see you , man . I 'd sure let you know if I 'd known you was there . " " What 's on your mind ? " " I got a hunch the fuel line on the boat 's the same size as the one on the generator . I 'm going to take me off a piece , and see if she fits . " " Oh , " said Pollock . " O.K. , then . Pass , friend . " Jackson grinned and went down to the boat , and the three men watched him in silence . After several minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why ? " said Pollock . " He 's all right . " " He knows too much . No nigger should know as much as he does . " " What different how much he knows ? " " If a nigger knows too much , it makes him cocky , andthey ai n't nothing worse than a cocky nigger . I know . " " Oh ? " said Pollock , regarding him with interest . " Howcome ? " " Back home , if a nigger gets too cocky , we beat him , " Grimes said . " That , or we shoot him . Depends on how cocky he gets . " " Back home , " Lassiter echoed . " You talk like you do n't live in trees . " " I do n't live in no trees , man , " Grimes replied , hotly . " We got us a house and we got us an outhouse and we got us a still . Do n't give me no shit about we live in no trees . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a road . " " Then how come you tell me to get home you got ta swing on vines ? "  | " That was a joke , shithead . We got a black-top road comes within three miles of the house . " " Sorry . " Lassiter smiled . " From what you said , it made it sound like you live in trees . " " Where do you live , shithead ? You gon na tell me you live with the King of England ? " " There is no King of England . They got a Queen . " " Oh , a smart-ass . I suppose you know everything . I suppose you know her name , too . " " Sure . Elizabeth . " " Well , shithead , even I know better than that . Queen Elizabeth died a hundred years ago , so do n't try to give me no shit about that . " " All right , let 's cool it , " Pollock said . " Grimes does n't live in trees , and Lassiter does n't live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Grimes lapsed into silence , and they watched Jackson remove a length of tubing from the boat engine . He inspectedit , blew through it , then gathered up what tools he could find and came back toward them . " You think it 'll work ? " Pollock asked . " I sure hope so , " Jackson replied . " I 'd like to get off this goddam island as quick as possible . You all see allythingof Simmons ? " " No , man . You 're the first living thing we 've seen . Where 'd he go ? " " In town , I guess . I do n't know . " Jackson looked worried , and shook his head . " Well , that wo n't get the engine fixed , " he said , and trudged on past them . " Next time , give the password , " Pollock called after him . " O.K. , " said Jackson . " What is it ? "  | " Nooky ! " Pollock shouted , and they all laughed . Silence descended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spread the contents out in the sun to dry . There were snapshots , cards , several religious medals , some tightly folded letters , and a rolled contraceptive . This last he unrolled , blowing gently into it as he did , and then after inspecting it for water damage he slipped two fingers into it and re-rolled it . Pollock watched him without comment , and Grimes stared out at the green-andpurplesea . The heat made them drowsy , and they had no sense of the passage of time ; they were suspended in a bright , burning limbo , and their only defense was their ability , quickly acquired , to turn off their minds and think of nothing . Grimes must have been staring at the ships for several minutes before he realized what they were . There , on the horizon directly in front of him , were two grey shapes that had the unmistakable tapering silhouettes of destroyers , and although at that distance they seemed not to be moving , they had in fact covered a mile or more before his mind registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he shouted , pointing . " Cans ! " " I 'm a son of a bitch , " Pollock said . " So they are ! " " They must be looking for us ! " said Grimes , his voice rising . " Sure ! " said Lassiter . " Why else would they be here ? " Pollock , as the senior of the group , felt he had to think itthrough before he voiced an opinion . " Maybe , maybenot , " he said . " Maybe they 're looking for that sub . " " What sub ? " said Grimes . " I do n't see no sub . " " The one that followed us the night we got sunk , " Pol. - p265lock said , patiently . " Then that big goddam periscope that came up right next the raft . " " I was on the other raft , " Grimes said . " Or maybe I was in the water . I du n no . But these have got ta be looking for us . How do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a mirror or something , we could bounce the sun onto ' em , " Pollock said . " Hot damn ! " said Grimes , climbing out of the shelter . " Maybe if we wave they 'll see us ! " " Grimes , do n't be a goddam fool , " Pollock replied . " They could n't see us with radar . arms . " Hey ! " he shouted . " Hey , look this way ! Here we are ! " Pollock was later unable to recall exactly what happenednext . The tarpaulin seemed to explode in shreds above them , there was the hammering of machine-gun fire , and then he and Lassiter were trying to untangle themselves from the ruins of their shelter . He got his arms and head free , and saw a figure in olive-green fatigues with a submachine gun , and he fired his own gun without taking aim and saw the figure double up and fall backward . Then he got clear of the tarpaulin and ran toward the man , still firing , and he saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed . Then he heard Lassiter say , " Jesus , look at Grimes ! " and he turned around and saw Grimes lying face-down on the beach , kicking his feet and biting the sand . The next thing he remembered , he and Lassiter were standing over Grimes , and Lassiter was saying , " This is no fucking joke . What do we do now ? " " Hey , Grimesy , where 'd he get you ? " Pollock asked , butp266Grimes kept his eyes closed tight and gnawed at the sand . " We got ta get him outa here , " Lassiter said . " He 's gon na croak if we leave him here . " Pollock looked around . " Let 's make a stretcher , " he said . " If we try to carry him like this , we 'll just make him hurt worse . " He went back to the debris of the shelter , and found two poles long enough to hold a man , and by wrappingthe shredded tarpaulin between the poles he and Lassitermanaged to rig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lassiter . " Look at my goddam wallet ! " His wallet and the contents were strewn about the ground , and he started to gather the various pieces together . " Screw your wallet ! " Pollock shouted . " You can get that later ! Come on ! " Together they took the stretcher down and laid it next to Grimes . He had stopped thrashing , and was breathing in short , quick gasps . " How goes it , Grimesy ? " Pollock asked , and Grimes made a small sound . " That 's the spirit , " said Pollock . " Now , easy does it . We 're gon na put you on this stretcher , and take you up the hill . Easy , now  --  e-a-s-y  --  " As gently as they could , they edged Grimes onto the tarpaulin , then picked up the handles and went off the beach . As they passed the body in the grass , Pollock looked down and was astounded to see that it was a very young boy . He closed his eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get it down , and he had to spit to keep from choking . He breathed deeply , and kept spitting , and concentrated on the path ahead so as not to be sick.  |p267ONCE  HE 'D DECIDED to fortify Grimond 's house , Evers orderedeach man to take a machine gun and ammunition , and he set up a system whereby all the approaches were covered . Beyond that , he did n't have much of a plan . The Navy , he reflected , trained men for all sorts of emergencies afloat , but the Book was short on ideas for establishing a fortified redoubt . He asked Grimond if he had any suggestions , and Grimond blew out his cheeks in a long exhalation . " Commandant , I do n't know , " he said . " I 've heard it 's a good thing to have cross-fire , but that 's against a massed infantry attack . When you 're dealing with guerrillas , all the rules go pouf. "  | " It would be nice to have mortars and air cover and helicopters , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chopper , we could bug out of here and forget the whole thing . The trouble is , we have none of the modern military conveniences . " " When I was a boy , " Grimond said , " I grew up with the debris left by military men . It does n't really matter what they do it with , it 's what they 're doing , and it all winds up the same . A shinbone here , a skull there  --  who cares what the weapons are ? " " It 's a sound thought , but it hardly helps us now . " Grimond stared at the ceiling . " Of course , " he said , " we could always build a gigantic wooden horse , and hide in that . That 's been known to be very effective . " Evers laughed . " Permission granted , " he said . " You build the horse , and we 'll hide in it . " Ferguson had neither spoken nor moved from his chair , and now he looked at Evers . " May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " You may if you keep a civil tongue in your head , " Evers replied . " What do you want ? " " Will I be allowed to defend myself like the others , or am I to be sacrificed to the barbarians ? " " Meaning precisely what ? " " Meaning may I have my gun back ? " " Oh . " Evers took the pistol , checked the safety catch , and handed it to Ferguson butt end first . " If you use it as intended , " he said . Ferguson 's smile was like the edge of a razor . " Do n't tempt me . " He slid the gun into its holster , and settled back . From outside came the sound of someone hammeringp269on metal , and Evers went to a back window and saw Jacksonworking in the generator shed . " Well , what do you know ? " he said . " Maybe we 've got a little progress going . " He turned to Grimond . " Keep an eye on things for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's doing . " " Does this mean I 'm relieved of all duties ? " Ferguson asked . " You 're putting this gun-running Commie in commandover me ? " " I 'm putting nobody in command . I 'm asking Mr. Grimondto look after his own house while I 'm outside . " Ferguson , who had been leaning forward , settled back again . " I just wanted to see how you phrased it , " he said . " I have my own report I 'm going to make out , you know . " " That 's your privilege . " To keep from saying anything more , Evers went quickly out the back door and crossed to the generator shed . Jackson looked up at him , and smiled . " She fits , " he said . " What does ? " " I took me some tubing from the boat . It 's the same size , and all I got ta do now is sweat it on . If I had the right tools , I 'd be done by now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do n't have any fuel . " " You mean there 's no diesel oil on this whole island ? " " Bromley and Stackpole found some , but now its gone . Someone hid it on them . " " Who 's been doing all the shooting ? " " Almost everybody . Among other things , there 's a group of guerrillas who seem to be cranking up for an at-tack . " Jackson whistled . " Man , " he said . " That do n't help us one little bit . "  | " That , " said Evers , " is an understatement . When you 're through with that , you 'd better come on back into the house . " " What good 'll that do ? If we got no fuel , we ca n't run the generator . " " Jackson , we 've got to take things one at a time . The first thing is to survive this attack ; after that , we can worry about fuel . " " Captain , that do n't make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get it now . " " And how are we going to get it ? I told you , the people who own it hid it . Bromley and Stackpole went back to get it , and they almost got shot . " Jackson thought for a moment . " I got a hunch I can do it , " he said . " At least let me try . " " What makes you think so ? " " A black man can do a lot of things on this island a white man ca n't . Even the gorillas 'll think twice before they shoot a black man , because he just might be one of them . I think I can make it work . " Evers hesitated , weighing the possibilities , and then said , " All right . But for God 's sake be careful . We 've got enough grief already . " " Do n't worry about me . Where do I go  --  where 'd they find it before ? " " A place called the Jolly Roger Tavern . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where . " " Should n't be too hard to find a place like that . Soon 's I finish this , I 'll zip on down and have a look . " " Well , God bless you . " Evers turned away , and saw two men coming slowly up from the beach , carrying a third onp271a makeshift stretcher . " Oh , no , " he said . " Now what ? " He called to the men , " What happened ? " " Some kid come at us with a gun , " Pollock replied . " He snuck up behind us , and got Grimes . " He spat , swallowed , and said , " Then I got him . " " How is Grimes ? " " He ai n't good , Captain . He looks like he hurts pretty bad . " Evers went to the stretcher , and looked down at Grimes . He was pale , and his mouth was covered with sand . His clothing was soaked with blood , and it was impossible to see where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Evers asked . In a small voice that was practically a whisper , Grimes said , " Piss poor . " " That 's the first time he 's spoke , " Pollock observed . " It must mean he 's getting better . " When they got him inside they found that two slugs had hit him , one in the buttocks and one in the side . The buttockswound was the more painful , but the one in the side had gone all the way through , from back to front just belowthe ribs , and there was no telling how much damage it had done . " Where 's the nearest doctor ? " Evers asked . " Do you mean real doctor ? " Grimond replied . " Yes , I mean real doctor ! What the hell did you think I meant ? " " The nearest real doctor is two islands away , " Grimond said . " There 's an obeah man here , but he generally does n't practice on the island . " After a pause , he added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Why not ? "  |p272Grimond  cleared his throat . " I have the feeling you have  --  how should I say ?  --  alienated the natives . " They cleaned Grimes 's wounds , made him as comfortable as possible , and gave him some aspirin . Then they waited . There was no more firing , and although once or twice the lookouts reported seeing people among the trees , nobody came near the house . The afternoon heat was stultifying ; it filled the room and made the men perspire and itch , and the barrels on the lookouts ' guns were as hot as though they 'd fired them . Outside , the sunlight made reflectionson the rocks and ground and trees , and even the scrubby bushes seemed to mirror light . It became impossible to tell if men were out there or not , because everythingchanged shape and moved and glittered and danced . Then , slowly , the daylight began to turn orange with approachingsunset , and Evers became depressed . Jackson had been gone long enough to make several trips to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been either killed or captured . There 'd been no shots , but that proved nothing ; he could have been knifed , or strangled , or any number of things . The thought flashed across Evers ' mind that he might have deserted , but he rejected it immediately . Some of the others , perhaps , but never Jackson . And , really , none of the others was likely to desert , either . They might hate him , and they might wish him in hell , but that did n't change their basic loyalty . Their indoctrinationwas such that it would take an inhuman amount of mistreatment to make them desert . Besides , as Grimond had pointed out , they had managed very thoroughly to alienatethe natives , and there would be thin comfort for any man who chose to cross the lines . The daylight gave way to purple dusk , and then sud/denly it was dark . The silence in the house was broken only occasionally by small , complaining noises from Grimes . Evers could see the silhouettes of the lookouts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other men around him . The air was heavy with a feeling of hostilityand despair . After a long while , he spoke toward where Grimond was sitting . " Will you tell me something ? " he said . " If I can , " Grimond replied . " Why is it , with the best damn intentions in the world , we suddenly wind up the heavies ? Why are we villains when we mean well ? " " I guess that depends on what you mean by good inten-tions . " " We do n't wish anybody any harm . All we want is to get away . " " Well . . . What are you doing here in the first place ? " " You know that . We were shipwrecked . " " But what were you doing ? " " Nothing to harm anyone . It was a defensive operation , nothing more . " " That word again . " " It still should n't make villains of us . Everyone does it . " " Should n't , perhaps  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Brooding in the darkness , Evers gave up wondering what had happened to Jackson , and assumed he was either killed or captured . So there went that hope , and what else was left ? Nothing . A blank wall . His mind caromed off that wall and began to grope about , searching for something to hang onto . He began to remember things , things from his childhood and things from college , and he tried top274dredge up passages he 'd committed to memory for college exams . Suddenly he found a parallel between himself and King Henry V before Agincourt ; the scene where the King is with his soldiers the night before the battle , giving them courage . He 'd had to memorize the Prologue to that scene , and how did it go ? There was a line0 , now , who will beholdThe royal captain of this ruin 'd band , then several more lines he could n't remember , ending withHis liberal eye doth give to every one , Thawing cold fear . Then , mean and gentle all , Behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry in the night . A little touch of Harry in the night . A little touch of Harry Evers in the night , but with a difference . He remembered how Laurence Olivier had played that scene in the movie , and how it had inspired him to become as great a leader as Olivier . That calm assurance , that quiet magic he imparted , had made men willing to die for him , and it had thrilled Evers to watch how the magic worked . And what had he in fact done ? He had been cursing and ranting and losing his temper , until not only would the men not follow him , but at least half of them were probably actively against him . Where had he gone wrong ? The more he looked at it , the further back his original error appeared , until it seemed that his entire time on the Icarus had been one long mistake . Among other things , he 'd lost his dignity , which was the one thing on which he prided himself , and he felt that lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to weep , not loudly but like a child with a bad dream , and Evers went to him and put a hand on his forehead . It was hot , but there was no point giving him more aspirin ; the only thing that would help was a doctor . His weeping stopped , but his nose was running , and it made his breathing clogged . Evers took out a soggy handkerchief , put it to Grimes 's nose , and said , " Blow , " and Grimes blew a short puff . Evers put the handkerchief back in his pocket , reflecting that it was the first constructive move he 'd made all day . He returned to his chair and the silence settled in again , and he knew his sanity would not survive the night . He took a deep breath , and held it while he made his decision . Then he let the air out , and said , " I want all of you to listen to me . " It was the equivalent of the Navy 's " Now hear this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from all corners of the room . Trying not to sound like Walter Mitty , he went on , " I 'm going out . I 'm going to find what happened to Jackson , and I 'm going to find some fuel . " " Ah , merde ! " Grimond protested . " T'es foul " " Please , " said Evers . " I got us into this , and it 's up to me to get us out . " Walter Mitty , Walter Mitty , Walter Mitty . His mouth was dry , and he ran his tongue over his gums and said , " I just want to say that I 've been wrong . I 've been wrong in everything I 've done since  --  well , since we went off to look for those flares and maybe before that , but certainly ever since then . I want to apologize to those of you I 've mistreated individually , such as Mr. Grimond , Mr. Ferguson , Bogardus , Proxmeyer , and Latch , and I want to apologize to you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was shouting at you , I wasp276really shouting at myself for being wrong . I was wrong , and nothing can alter that fact , but it 's just possible I can repair a little bit of the damage . And , oddly enough , it 's harder to admit this than it would have been to shut up and continuebeing wrong . " He stood up , and started for the door . " Commandant , " Grimond began , " if you will just wait  --  " " Mr. Grimond , " Evers said , " this may be one more of my wrong decisions , but there it is . Stackpole , may I borrowyour flashlight ? " A flashlight was put into his hands , and he said , " Thank you , " and went out the back door.  |p277WHEN  BROMLEY SLAMMED THE TRAP DOOR , Ernesto fell backward in the darkness and crashed against Ralph Matsuma , who 'd been standing beneath him. " 1Hijo de una puta ! " he shouted , as he untangled himself from Ralph 's frantic clutches . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been standing to one side and was clear of the thrashing men , and she moved to the table and groped for the lantern . " If one of you has a match , " she said , " I can give us light . " Ernesto produced a cigarette lighter , and in a moment the lantern filled the cellar with an orange-yellow glow . The three people cast shadows that writhed across the clutteredwalls and made the whole cellar seem to move ; it wasp278like being on the inside of a beating heart . Ernesto mounted the ladder and tried to force the trap door open , but the weight on top was too great , and he could do no more than make it wobble . Ralph joined him and added his strength , but the ladder began to crack under the pressure , and they stopped . " How about the table ? " Emilie suggested . " Move it over so you can stand on it , and you 'll have better luck . " " Ha , " said Ernesto . " That is constructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They moved the table under the trap door , and with the better platform and better leverage thus afforded , Ernesto and Ralph were able to raise the door slightly . But they still could n't open it wide , and it was Ralph who had the next idea . " Girl , " he said , to Emilie . " Come up here , and next time we lift the door you climb through , and take what is on top away . Otherwise , we will spend the rest of our lives in this cellar . " Emilie did as directed , and when the men had opened the door as far as they could , she hiked up her skirt , climbed partway up Ralph , then grabbed the edge of the opening and wormed her way through . As she went , the lower part of Ralph 's snake design flashed in front of Ernesto 's eyes , and he boggled . " Madre de Dios , " he said , struggling to hold the door open . " That is quite a snake . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A pity we could n't put him to use . " " It 's too good for the Yankees . That should be saved for people like you and me . " " Speak for yourself , " Ralph replied , primly . " I am only an artist . "  |p279Ernesto  glanced at him with curiosity , and then Emilie removed the kitchen table from atop the door , and they opened it wide . They put the cellar table back in place and went up into the kitchen , closing the trap door behind them . Their arms ached , and as Ernesto flexed his muscles he said , " That was bad luck . If I 'd captured those two , we 'd have had some hostages to bargain with . " " Bargain ? " Ralph asked . " Are n't you going to kill them ? " " Mainly , we want the guns , " Ernesto replied . " I told you my plan ; all I have to do is convince the leader . " " Convince me of what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beret . He held a submachine gun in the crook of his arm , and leaned casually against the door jamb . " What is it that I need convincing of , and who are these people ? " " This is Emilie , " Ernesto replied , clearing his throat . " She is our  --  our contact  --  our worker in Grimond 's house . And this is  --  " he turned to Ralph  --  " I 'm sorry . I do n't know your name . " " Mr. Ralph Matsuma , " Ralph replied , with a slight bow . " At your service . " " He is not of the Liberation Army , " Ernesto explained . " Or has not been , until now . But he will do everything he can to help . " The leader eyed Ralph with suspicion . " Which is what ? " he asked . " What do you want ? " said Ralph . " You name it , I will do it . " " And that is no idle offer , " Emilie put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  |p280The  leader 's eyes shifted to Emilie . " We are not playing games , " he said . " We need more than curses . " " And you 'll get it , " said Emilie . " I know . " The leader sniffed , and turned to Ernesto . " Now , what must I be convinced of ? " " I explained my plan of the sham battle , to draw the Yankees out . To me , it seems the best idea . " " The house is already surrounded . I have pickets watchingevery approach . Pablo is watching their boat guard , and he  --  " " Pablo ? " Ernesto exclaimed . " Por Dios , why Pablo ? Has n't he done enough wrong already ? " " This is his chance to redeem himself , " the leader replied . " He begged me , so I let him . It wo n't harm . " " Aie-e-e , " said Ernesto , holding his head . " No harmonly disaster . " " That 's not your worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Si . " " This will be no sham battle , either . " Ernesto shrugged . " As you command . " " Now . " The leader looked at Emilie and said , " You come with us . " " Why ? " Emilie asked . " Because I tell you . There may be need for you . " " What do you want me to do ? " Ralph asked . The leader hesitated , examining Ralph as though he were buying a horse , and then said , " You stay here , and make curses . " Ralph 's eyelids lowered . " I shall , " he said . " Stay where we can call you if we need you . " " I shall . " Emilie , who knew Ralph reasonably well , noticed hisp281expression and said , " You 're on our side , remember . Do n't go putting curses on us . " Ralph gave her a quick glance , and she said , " I think I 'll stay here , after all . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No harm will come to you . " There was the slightest emphasis on the " you , " and the leader took Emilie by the arm . " Andale , " he said , and hustled her out the door . Ernestofollowed , muttering . Ralph went to the door , and watched them as they walked down the street . He stared at the leader 's back as though he were aiming through a telescopic sight , and a slight yellowish film suffused his eyes . He murmured under his breath for a few moments , then turned and went briskly into the kitchen and began to set the furniture straight . With that done , he decided to clean the floor , which showed the effects of the recent traffic . He was on his hands and knees , scrubbing the boards with a block of pumice stone , when he heard unfamiliar footsteps on the walk , and looked around and saw a large , unshaven black man come through the swinging doors . His clothes were in tatters and stained with salt water , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other Yankees . " What you want ? " Ralph asked , getting slowly to his feet . He glanced at his meat cleaver , but it was too far away to reach . " Hello , brother , " Jackson said , pleasantly . " Do n't get yourself in a sweat . I ai n't gon na do no harm . " " What you want ? " Ralph repeated , edging toward the cleaver . " Come on , brother , cool it , " said Jackson . " All I want is a little jug of diesel oil . A gallon or two , no more . " " I do n't have diesel oil , " Ralph replied . " Then how you light them lights ? How you run thatp282jukebox ? I know you got oil here , because a couple my buddies saw it . I ai n't asking for much , just a jugful , and then I 'll be on my way . I 'll even bring the jug back when I 'm through . " Slowly , Ralph realized what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could get this man down into the root cellar and keep him there , he 'd have a hostage just as Ernesto had wanted . Ernesto might not be in charge , but a hostage was undeniably an asset , and the fuel drum was at this moment in the root cellar . " I tell you , man , " he said . " I do have oil , in a big drum downstairs . I do n't know how to get her up . " Jackson grinned . " No sweat about that , " he said . " You just show me , and I 'll worry about the rest . " Ralph opened the trap door , and picked up the lantern . " You go down , " he said . " I 'll follow soon as I light this . " " I 'll go down after you , " Jackson replied . " I ai n't all that stupid . " Ralph lighted the lantern , and without a word went down the ladder . Jackson followed , and Ralph set the lanternon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is , " he said . " You think you can hoist her up the ladder ? " " I wo n't have to , " Jackson replied . " All I need is a jug . You got a wrench , to undo this cap ? " " Look in that bin , over there , " Ralph said , gesturing to the far end of the cellar . " I 'll just empty this jug . " He took a two-gallon jug that had once held molasses but now containedcolored sand for rituals , and when Jackson was across the room peering into the bin , Ralph poured the sand into the chimney of the lantern , and in the sudden darkness sprang for the ladder . " Hey , what the hell ? " Jackson said , but before he couldp283cross the room , Ralph had fled up the ladder and slammed the trap door shut . " Sorry , man , I have things to do , " Ralph said . Standing on the trap door , which bounced under Jackson 's pounding , Ralph reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , then stepped off , and watched . He knew from experience how heavy it was , but he wanted to see if Jackson was strong enough to move it . The trap door surged as Jackson heaved against it , and then there came a crackling crash , and a thud , and muted cursing , and Ralph knew that the ladder had broken . He dusted his hands , and went outside . His first thought was to find Ernesto and tell him what he 'd done , but then he remembered the leader 's instructions to stay where he could be found , and he did n't know what to do . He did n't like the leader , and he could see Ernesto despised him , but it was clear he had unchallenged authority , and it would probably be best to obey . If he could only get rid of the nagging feeling that the divisivenessworked against these men , and made them more clownish than people to be taken seriously , he 'd have felt better about being a part of their operation . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  more dangerous , sometimes , than people who know what they 're doing , because they 're unpredictable , and he knew that the most dangerous thing in the world was to underestimateanyone with a gun . Better treat them for what they were : armed and deeply dedicated men , and not write them off as buffoons . The dedication made up for a lot of procedural errors . Resignedly , he went back into the Jolly Roger and tried to think of something for dinner , but his mind was n't onp284cooking ; he kept thinking about the black Yankee in the cellar . He 'd heard about them , but until now he 'd never seen one , and he determined to have a talk with him . Takinghis meat cleaver off the wall , he pushed the kitchen table aside and opened the trap door . Two white eyes glared up at him out of the darkness . " How are you , man ? " he asked . " How the hell you think I am ? " Jackson replied . " I like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry , " Ralph said . He pulled a chair over and sat at the edge of the hole , with his cleaver resting across his lap . " I thought you and I might talk . " " Well , I got ta get up the hill . They ca n't work the radio till I bring the fuel . " " What your hurry , man ? You jump every time they speak ? " " My hurry is to get off this goddam island . " " It is not so bad on this island . You perhaps like it here . " " Thanks all the same , brother . I 'm getting off quick 's I can . " " You mean you like it with the white man ? You rather be with the white man than your own kind ? " " I do n't like it with the white man . No brother likes it , but there ai n't no choice . " " Stay here . Or if this island does n't please you , find another . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a job , and I 'm gon na do it . " " For the white man . " " No , man ! For me ! " " How for you ? " Jackson sighed . " I do n't know how to explain it , "
