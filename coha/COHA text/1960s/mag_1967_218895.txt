He was one of U.S. sport 's first great television heroes , the Saturday idol of millions , long before anyone heard of Arnie Palmer or Wilt the Stilt or Johnny U.

When he lost the 1953 Kentucky Derby by a head to a 25-1 shot named Dark Star , fans turned from their TV sets in tears . <P> That was the only race Native Dancer ever lost . In a three-year career marred by bad luck ( he was knocked off stride by a swerving horse in the Derby ) and a succession of physical ailments ( bucked shins , stone bruises , a bad ankle , a sore hoof ) , Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt 's " Grey Ghost " won 21 out of 22 races and $785,240-surpassing the record of the legendary Man o War .

One of his grandsons , Northern Dancer , won the Kentucky Derby in 1964 ; one of his sons , Kauai King , won the Derby and the Preakness in 1966 . This summer , at the Saratoga yearling sale , nine of his offspring brought an average $61,000 each . <P> Last week at 17 ( equivalent human age : 50 ) , Native Dancer fell ill , and was rushed to the University of Pennsylvania 's veterinary hospital , where surgeons removed an intestinal tumor .
