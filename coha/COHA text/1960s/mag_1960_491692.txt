The Strange Case of Although rich in resources and natural beauty , the Mountain State suffers from chronic , grinding poverty . A report on West Virginia an American paradox . West Virginia , a scenically radiant moun  --  tain state which likes to call itself the Switzer  --  land of America , received a blow across the face not long ago when one of its native sons declared , " Switzerland , nothing ! It 's more like Afghanistan ! " This young man , who was writing to his home-town paper from Akron , Ohio  --  a city to which he and 40,000 other West Virginians have fled since World War II in search of work  --  said he was shocked when he compared his former surroundings with what he saw elsewhere . Pointing to his native state 's unem  --  employment  --  consistently the highest in the na  --  tion  --  its second-rate roads , its ugly auto dumps , its polluted streams , and its dearth of good restaurants and hotels , he called West Virginia " remote , backward and dangerously provincial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks on a sag  --  ging front porch while her neighbors drive by in shiny new cars . " He was not alone . A growing list of people , young and old , have been pointing accusing 19 fingers at the state during the last few years . Citizens of the big Midwestern cities , where West Virginia 's destitute workers have streamed hoping to find jobs , have had some particu  --  larly harsh things to say about the " hillbillies " who have become the mid-century 's Okies . One paper called the Mountain State 's mi  --  grants " shoeless , shiftless , beer-swilling clods who would n't go to a church that did n't use rattlesnakes in the service . " And at least one national foundation has accorded these people the doubtful compliment of undertaking a major study of their " problems . " But perhaps the worst blow to the ego of a state that has produced both Gen. Stonewall Jackson , the Civil War genius , and Maj. Charles Yeager , the first man to break the sonic barrier , came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia 's largest newspaper , the Charleston Gazelle , unleashed a series of articles labeled What 's Wrong With West Virginia ? In it a string of native sons re  --  vealed scandalous things about the state 's eco  --  nomic , social and cultural condition that would have been tolerated from no outsider . And before the first article had been on the streets ten minutes , the newspaper 's switchboard lit up , in the words of an editor , " like a Roman candle . " It stayed that way for two weeks . Everybody got into the act , pro and con , and the state had n't seen such a controversy since it seceded from Virginia during the Civil War and became a state of its own . When all the sound and the fury had died down , however , West Virginians were aware of a few unpleasant but unassailable facts : 1 . Although it 's the fourth-richest state in natural-resources production , it has the high  --  est unemployment in the country , three times the national average . 2 . Its illiteracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nation . 3 . Its annual farm income is at the . bottom of the heap . 4 . It has a higher ratio of illegitimate white babies than any other state . 5 . Its young people , the hope of any stale , are deserting the ship in alarming numbers . While most states have seen their populations zoom in the last decade , West Virginia has found itself with an actual population loss of almost S per cent  --  the highest in the nation . With statistics like this , it would be easy for any outsider to get the impression that West Virginia is all poverty , ignorance and hope  --  lessness . Or that it is not only sick but ready for the coop de grrice . But after spending several weeks there recently and covering 2500 miles of its roller-coaster roads that took me to al  --  most every corner of the state , I have come away convinced that West Virginia is far from moribund . It is merely suffering from an acute case of schizophrenia . Take Charleston , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This bustling city of more than 100,000 is studded with modern industry . Gleaming new offices and factories adorn its river front , and bank de  --  posits are at an all-time high . Its airport , in  --  geniously and expensively embossed on three mountains by lopping off the tops and filling in the valleys , is busy all day long bringing pros  --  perous people to and from the city . But then consider what 's going on just across the hills . Not very many miles away is a county where ? 1 per cent of the people  --  most of whom have exhausted their unemployment benefits  --  arc being kept alive by handouts of surplus Government food . West Virginians call it " mollygrub . " Or consider another county where the ath  --  letic director of a high school recently esti  --  mated that 117 young students had to go with  --  out lunch regularly because they did n't have the necessary twenty-five cents to purchase it . Or still another county where a hospital head told a congressional committee that his insti  --  tution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one man had died of it . " It is horrifying , " this doctor said , " to think of a social order that has so many people in need of public assistance . " ( Continued on Page 64 ) ( Continued from Page 20 ) Even coal , that staple of industry which has been the backbone of the state 's economy for so long , has developed a schizoid nature . Although West Virginia is still he nation 's biggest producer of soft coal , it has remained so only at the cost of a gigantic , state-wide headache . In the last ten years . mechanization of the mines , carried out with the approval of both the operators and the union , has toppled the working force from 117,000 to less than 40,000 men . Scores of ghost towns have sprung up like mushrooms across the slate , and thousands of men , especially those over forty , have no further pros  --  pects of re-employment in the industry . And yet more coal is being produced and sold than ever before . Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any industrial workers in the country  --  approximately twenty-five dollars a day . Incredible as it seems , some miners are actually working overtime ! To a casual visitor many of Vest Vir  --  ginia 's towns look depressed . In general , there are few of the modern buildings one sees in other cities  --  the new motels , res  --  taurants , shopping centers , schools and public buildings that have sprung up since World War II . In testimony before the congressional committee mentioned earlier , the head of the state 's Industrial and Publicity Cornmission , Don Crislip , declared , " We have failed to attract diversified industry be  --  cause we have let our roads , our schools , our communities and our homes slip both in efficiency and appearance . " Although the natural beauty of West Virginia has far from slipped  --  every cor  --  ner of the state has stunning scenery  --  there are few of the facilities which the average American tourist has come to expect when on vacation . In beautifully situated Bluefield , for example , a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest cli  --  mates in the East , I suggested to one of the town 's leading citizens that tourism might be a good industry to take up the slack . " What are you going to do with people when you get them here ? " he asked with a shrug . " There 's not a first-class restaurant in town , and you ca n't buy a drink at a bar , " It is one of the prime paradoxes of this paradoxical state , of course , that not many miles from Bluefield lies one of the most famous tourist resorts in all Amer  --  ica  --  the Greenbrier at White Sulphur Springs . Possibly from a sense of guilt that the state should produce such startling con  --  trasts , as well as from the flood of criti  --  cism recently encountered , West Virgin  --  ians have acquired a high degree of sensi  --  tivity . And one of the things they dislike most is 5eing called a hillbilly , rather than a mountaineer . The former is a fighting word , except , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to explain the difference to me and then gave up . " Let 's put it this way , " he said . " A hill  --  billy lies under a tree , and a mountaineer sits on the porch . It 's all very touchy . " Another highly articulate observer of the local scene , West Virginia University 's young librarian , Bob Munn , summed up what he called the state 's " tremendous defense mechanism " by saying , " We either take the tack that we 're no good and that there 's no use trying , or that we have the best state in the union . " The seat of this excellent university , in  --  cidentally , is in Morgantown , the first town I hit when I drove into the state . I found it still smarting under the impact of a national telecast which focused on Morgantown as one of America 's most depressed cities . " Of course there 's unemployment , " said Jim McCartney , genial director of its chamber of commerce , " but there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new $30,000,000 hospital and medical center being built at the uni  --  versity . " Things are n't so bad when they can do that , " he said . From the point of view of Jim Mc  --  Cartney and other town boosters , insult was added to injury when , after viewing the telecast , a Maryland high-school class took up a collection and sent fourteen dollars to the " stricken city . " The gesture may have been unappreciated by some , but Lt. Marshall Clary of the Salvation Army , to whom the money was turned over , was happy to get it . Shortly after the controversial tcic vision program , for example , Lieutenant Clary was called to Grafton late one night , where he found a mother and ten children living in one room . The mother was ill with influenza , and all the children had chicken pox . The father , an ex-miner , was away in New Jersey looking for work . Food , clothing and medicine Were needed in the Grafton household fast , and Lieu  --  tenant Clary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift . It helped him provide the necessary relief . Unlike the mother in Grafton , other impoverished West Virginia mothers , caught up in what Dr. Leo Fishman , the university 's leading economist , calls February 6 , 1960 " conditions approximating the worst years of the depression , " have connived with their husbands to set up desertion proceedings . Under state law , no family is eligible for assistance if there is an employ  --  able male in the household , no matter how impossible it is for him to find work . Mrs. Elsie Saber , a worker in the state 's Department of Public Assistance , gave me an example of how this works . Recently a family  --  man , wife and six children  --  came to her office in Morgan  --  town looking for help . Fifty years old , the father had been let out of the mines a year ago and found it impossible at his age to get any other kind of work . After exhaust  --  ing his unemployment security , as well as his other resources , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to explain to him that as long as he was tech  --  nically employable , she could not help him . A few weeks later the mother returned  --  without her husband . He had , she said hesitantly , " deserted " her . When told that she could not qualify for relief unless she swore out a warrant for his arrest , tears came to her eyes . She said nothing , looked at her children and then at Mrs. Saber . Finally , with what was obviously an inner struggle , she agreed to do it Mrs. Baba , a motherly person who herself has five children and was once chosen West Virginia 's Mother of the Year , confessed that she was so upset by the capricious quirks of the state 's relief laws that she had decided to quit her job . She was particularly distressed by what she called " West Virginia 's encourage  --  ment of illegitimacy . " Under state law the more children a mother has , the more money she can get  --  provided , of course , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , a woman can draw up to S 165 a month in state funds . " Some women , " she said , " make a career of it ! " This unhappy state of affairs , of course , is far from the complete picture of Mor  --  gantown . Those who like to believe that there 's nothing wrong with the town that a " little gumption " wo n't fix , point to a remarkable man from Ohio by the name of J. Wesley Ruby . At the beginning of World War II Mr. Ruby rode into Morgantown and , with fifteen other men , started making plumbing fixtures in an old factory . Today he has 2000 people working for him and is far and away the largest employer in the area . A living ex  --  ample of what can be done in diversifica  --  tion and in getting away from the tyr-nny of a single industry  --  coal  --  Mr. Ruby in  --  sists people must get into other fields . " There 's nothing wrong with th , peo  --  ple , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to give a day 's work for a day 's pay . " Any unbiased observer must agree that Mr. Ruby is right about the people . Largely native-born , Anglo-Saxon stock , they strike the visitor as gentle , proud , polite and full of kindness to strangers . 1 heard of a touching example of this in Charleston during the height of the na  --  tion 's integration violence . A few days before Christmas an elderly Negro had come to town to buy a Christ  --  mas gift during the evening shopping hours . He was driving down one of the main streets in his old model car , makingscant progress in the bumper-to-bumper traffic . Suddenly his lire blew out . He managed to draw to the side and park in front of a locksmith 's shop . Agitated be  --  cause he was unable to fix the tire himself , he went off in search of a repairman , The locksmith , standing in front of his shop with a friend , look in the incident and decided to do something about it . Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , found a spare tiro and replaced the damaged one . He locked the trunk up again and returned to his position in front of the shop . When the elderly Negro came back , he was more distressed than ever . He 'd been unable to find any garage open to help him . Then he saw his tire had been changed and could n't believe his eyes . " Lord , " he said , " there must be a guard  --  ian angel ! " As he drove off , the two men in front of the shop bid him a Merry Christmas . In view of the warmth of most West Virginians , the paradox of want and plenty living side by side seems all the more baffling . But the fact is that West Virginia 's problems are too big and too deep-seated to be solved by individual generosity . One of West Virginia 's monumental problems , for example , is her topography , something that few individuals care to tackle singlehanded . Except for a narrow strip along the Ohio and Kanawha rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tainous . As one wit remarked , " West Vir  --  ginia is a wonderful place to work . When you get tired , you can lean up against it . " Large-scale agriculture , except in the Eastern Panhandle and the Greenbrier Valley , where slopes are gentler , is im  --  possible . And in the opinion of Doctor Fishman , " farming is being done on marginal land where it should n't be done . " It is perhaps for this reason that , in the present era of large-scale farming , West Virginia 's average farm income re  --  cently hit a national low of 5897 . The na  --  tional average was S2269 . Moreover , in view of modern industry 's demands for large , flat parking areas , the state 's topography poses an even stiffer problem . And her valleys , steep and nar  --  row , have little water for industrial use . Complicating the problem is the need for good , fast roads to carry products to markets . But as everybody pointed out to me , including the state 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roads in West Virginia cost about two and a half times as much to build as they do in flatter states . It is partly for this reason that the state 's highway system is several decades behind that of its neigh  --  bors . If Vest Virginia 's hilly terrain has kept its people isolated from one another , its geography has played a part too . In the extreme Northern Panhandle , for exam  --  ple , Wheeling , the steel city , is more geared to Pittsburgh 's economy than to the rest of the state . In the west , Hunting  --  ton looks toward Cincinnati rather than to Charleston . And in the south , Bluefield and the other cities in the area are eco  --  nomically tied to Richmond and Norfolk . As for the distant Eastern Panhandle , the famous town of Harpers Ferry , where John Brown made his bid to free the slaves a hundred years ago , lies only fifty-five miles from Washington , D.C. West Virginians like to give a toast which sums up the curious contours of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " a damn good state for the shape it 's in ! " Another problem that can not be solved by individual enterprise is taxation . At the moment West Virginia is forty-seventh among the states in per-capita income from taxes . To a certain extent this is be  --  cause in past years the state 's resources were largely owned and exploited by out  --  siders , who were interested in keeping // taxes as low as possible . It is also generally admitted that , in the past at least , these men controlled the legislatures which passed the tax laws . In short , the citizens allowed others to carry away coal , timber and natural-gas resources without plow  --  ing any of the profits back . " The trouble with that sturdy moun  --  taineer who 's a symbol of the state , " said a West Virginian angrily , " is that he 's been an ignorant fool . He 's allowed oth  --  ers to plunder his state and he has n't in  --  sisted on the kind of taxes and political leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still low by compar  --  ison with other states , Recently , when a severance tax of ten cents was proposed on every ton of coal taken out of the state  --  a measure taken by some other states  --  it was promptly defeated . There is no state income tax , and necessary revenues have been raised by piecemeal measures  --  a tax on soft drinks , a consumers ' sales tax , a gross sales tax on business , another on cigarettes , and so on . Property taxes are still low . One man I talked to in Bluefield had a new $11,000 house . His yearly property taxes were only thirty-six dol  --  lars , and in his frank words , " The com  --  community looks like it . " Without an overhaul of the basic tax structure , most people believe that the state will continue to have inferior roads , libraries , hospitals , social services and , of course , schools . However , a number of the educators I talked to felt that one thing tax money would not improve was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward better education . " Even if better schools were built , " a teacher told me , " there 's a good chance youngsters would not attend . The over  --  whelming goal of our youth is to be six  --  teen , quit school and buy a car . Mothers and fathers seem to encourage this , and many of them do n't even go to graduation ceremonies . Possibly because parents have so little education themselves , there 's very little drive for it . " This particular teacher , in pointing out how sensitive parents can be when their children are better educated than they are , told me of a college-educated girl who admitted she was careful to use " haint " when around her mother and father . It is easier to understand such attitudes when one considers the life and traditions that have existed for generations in coal communities , Consider what this sociolo  --  gist , for example , had to offer on the subject . " The general shabbiness of mining camps is due to a long tradition , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mined out , and your children did the same . Then you moved on . You looked upon your community as a temporary one , and edu  --  cation did not seem too important . Why bother to fix up schools or anything else when the company owned your house , the store , the doctor and even you ? " Since coal is West Virginia 's most im  --  portant natural resource and the one to which the prosperity of the state is still reluctantly hinged , I wanted to visit a mining community . But the business lead  --  ers to whom I suggested it looked pained . Their point of view , I found , was not unusual . Understandably eager to put their best foot forward , they wish out  --  siders would forget about the miners . They 'd like to sweep them under the rug . Perhaps , they feel , if no one mentions the miners , they will go away . did , of course , visit a number of coal towns , and two of the most interesting were Stotesbury and McAlpin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket of the hills , not far from Beckley , " the smokeless coal capital of the world . " Stotesbury , formerly the home town of West Virginia 's ambitious United States senator , Robert C. Byrd , is an unbelieva  --  bly dismal ghost town . I found rows of empty , decaying , grimy houses . Here and there a family still occupied an unpainted shack , surrounded by rubbish , weeds and soot . Overstuffed couches , their entrails bursting through the rags that covered them , sat sadly on the porches . Several children , their faces dirty , played silently in the empty streets . There was little ac  --  tivity anywhere , and less hope . One house showed some signs of life , and I stopped to investigate . There were five persons living in it  --  an elderly woman and her four grandchildren . The oldest child was a pretty blond girl of fifteen . She was the head of the family . She ex  --  plained that the mine had n't operated in two years , but since her parents had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had continued to live in it . With no money to repair it , the house , like all the others , was rotting away . It had four rooms , outdoor plumbing and few conveniences . The father had tried to get work elsewhere and had managed to do so for a time . But finally his luck ran out . He had taken his last relief check , put some gas in the family jalopy and , with his wife , gone to Cleveland to look for work . " As soon as daddy gets a job , " said the girl , " we 're all going to Cleveland . " McAlpin , Stotesbury 's neighbor , pre  --  sents the other side of the bituminous coin . The mine is still operating , and al  --  though the community is far from attrac  --  tive by even the loosest standards , it is still alive . The Testermans , whom I visited , are typical of a working miner 's family . They live in a company-owned frame house ? " five rooms and path " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay only 515.20 a month . They have four children , and Fred Testerman , who is thirty-three , has never been unemployed . At present he works on a conveyor belt . Despite full employment for people like Fred Testerman , however , McAlpin is not a happy place . Too many people see the handwriting on the wall . They do not know when increasing mechanization of the mine will take their jobs away or when the mine will be found obsolete and closed down . They 've seen it happen in Stotes  --  bury and they know it can happen in McAlpin . And if the Testermans have any doubts , they have only to look at their neighbor , big , husky , sandy-haired Hustle Mc  --  Daniel . Hustle is Fred 's age , and he has a wife and four fine sons . After a long pe  --  riod in which he worked part-time and the family income got smaller and smaller , he was finally laid off last November . Now , with his unemployment benefits exhausted , he is desperate . The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking work in a " gopher-hole " mine  --  a growing phenomenon in coal communities . These small operations , which go on outside the union , usu  --  ally consist of four or five men who band together to buy a secondhand truck and go into business for themselves . They dig into a hillside  --  almost any hillside will yield coal in West Virginia  --  or work an abandoned mine that is no longer profit  --  able to operate by machines with union labor . There seems to be a steady market for their cut-rate product . But the " go  --  pher " mine which Hustic visited had of  --  fered him only two dollars a day . He might have taken it , but the gasoline nec  --  essary to get him back and forth to the mine made the offer impossible . Conse  --  quently , as soon as he can scrape up enough money , he plans to leave his fam  --  ily and look for work in the shipyards of Newport News , Virginia . In essence , his story has been repeated  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War 11 . " The trouble with people like Hustle , " said an official back in the capital , Charles  --  ton , " is that he 's not trained to do any  --  thing but mining . If he 's young enough and has the time , he can learn something else . But if he 's over forty , about the only job he can get is as a janitor or watchman . That 's the real tragedy . " At the moment , a bill is pending before Congress which will provide Federal funds to rehabilitate depressed areas . Part of the money will be spent to retrain people like Hustle . But as critics of the bill have pro  --  tested : " Train them for what ? First you have to get the industry . " Many people in West Virginia , includ  --  ing its two senators , Robert Byrd and Jennings Randolph , feel that one solution to the depressed coal areas would be small , light industries that would be " fin  --  ishers " of such raw materials as the aluminum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio River at Ravenswood . They would not require much fiat land or water . Another solution offered for Vest Vir  --  ginia 's ailing No . I industry has been re  --  search . A Bluefield newspaper editor , Jerry McDevitt , declared that in one year recently the chemicals industry spent $361,000,1X10 in research while coal spent a mere $17,000,000 . " If you do n't spend money on research , you 're licked , " he said . A current development , which is caus  --  ing hope to flutter in the hearts of Gover  --  nor Underwood and others , is a new type of road using soft coal as a binder-2200 tons per mile of highway . If it catches on , it will be a big boon to the industry . Some of the other suggestions made to aid coal communities have been more bizarre . One expert insisted recently that the state 's abandoned mines would make ideal places in which to start growing mushrooms . Everybody I talked to in West Virginia and in Washington , where I later inter  --  viewed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's problems . For some , it was massive Federal aid , something akin to a native Point Four pro  --  gram , which would do for one of our own states what we have been doing abroad . For others it was a subsidy on coal . " We should buy up surplus coal the way we buy up food , " argued one man . " In that way we can keep miners on tap if there 's a national emergency and we need them . " Some even thought a few of the state 's problems might be solved by a change in the drinking laws , At present , liquor can be bought in most West Virginia counties , but it is impossible to buy a drink in a restaurant or bar . This , it was argued , is the reason there are so few tourists and such a dearth of good restaurants . But the more the doctors look at the proffered remedies , the more they are apt to feel that no single one will do the trick , Probably it will take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Virginia 's strange malady in which want and plenty , ignorance and knowledge , squalor and beauty live side by side to a degree un  --  known in other states . Curiously enough , as I drove through the state , I found few people , even in the coal camps , who felt that Vest Virginia 's problems were insoluble . Most people thought their basically rich state , long plundered by absentee landlords and later plagued by all the woes of a one-industry area trying to convert to a multi-industry one , was only just beginning to catch a glimpse of its potential . Such people as Charley Hodges . director of Charleston 's chamber of commerce , for example , like to point out what has been accomplished in the Kanawha River basin . At the mo  --  ment this area has created what is perhaps the greatest concentration of basic chemi  --  cal production in the country . It has given the world nylon and other valuable syn  --  thetic materials . And in so doing it has boosted the Charleston average family in  --  come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East . Another encouraging sign , of course , is the growing capacity for self-criticism  --  the basis for any reform . " I think people should point out West Virginia 's faults , " says Harry Ernst , Gazelle education editor and one of the state 's angry young men . " We 've glamorized the ignorant hillbilly  --  complete with bare feet and moonshine  --  too long . Illiteracy is n't cute in the atom age ! " In the past , West Virginians have been famous for their inquiry and their inge  --  nuity . It was a West Virginian , James Rumsey , who had a steamboat operating on the Potomac at Shepherdstown twenty years before Robert Fulton 's . It was an  --  other , Andrew S. Rowan , who carried the " message to Garcia , " and another , Wil  --  liam L. Wilson , who originated the rural  --  free-delivery postal system . It was Henry Gassaway Davis , a West Virginian by adoption , who first worked out a plan for running railway trains at night , and still another , Archibald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for West Virginia 's independence and per  --  suaded Lincoln to recognize it as a sepa  --  rate state . Thcrc is still plenty of ingenuity in the West Virginia hills , in communities with such fine , blunt names as Cyclone , Cu  --  cumber , Shock , Frozen , Left Hand , Gip , Pinch , Quick and Red Jacket . But the in  --  genuity is hampered at present by what might best be described as a bit of coal dust in the eyes . When all the dust has set  --  tled , the going should be clearer . " You must remember , " warned a na  --  tive at lovely White Sulphur Springs , where I took my leave of the state , " that we 're going through a violent industrial revolution  --  with few of the things other states have to cushion the shock . It 'll be all right eventually , but it sure is a hell of a rough ride along the way . " THE END               @ @ @ @ @ @
