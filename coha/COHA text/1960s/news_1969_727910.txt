txt Vice President Agnew and the Republican National Chairman expressed support today for State Senator John J. Marchi , the winner of the New York City Republican mayoral primary . But the White House remained silent . Representative Rogers C. B. Morton , the party chairman , set aside his personal preference for Mayor Lindsay and endorsed the Republican winner . Mr. Agnew said Mr. Marchi would be supported by " the Administration . " But during two White House news briefings , President Nixon 's official spokesman declined to provide any comment or indicate whether the President would endorse Senator Marchi in the general election . Interviewed in Pittsburgh after a speech to the United States Conference of Mayors , Vice President Agnew said of the New York primary results : " The Republican party supports its nominees . The Administra- // tion will support that nomMr . Morton sent Senator IMarchi a telegram of conIlgratulation for " a campaign ' well run and a job well done . " A national committee spokesman , in response to a question , said : " The Republican national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominee . " Ronald L. Ziegler , the White House press secretary , was asked if President Nixon would support Mr. Marchi in the general election in New York City . " The President has made a practice  --  he will not have a comment on local elections of this type , " he replied . A reporter asked if this meant that the President refused to support Mr. Marchi . " The President has not in the past , and will not in the future , comment on local elections , " Mr. Ziegler said . Defeat in Minneapolis In the Minneapolis mayoral election , decided a week ago , President Nixon gave the Republican contender , Dan Cohen , a letter of endorsement , praising him as a man who could " prevail over reaction and extremism . " Despite this support , Mr. Cohen lost the election . The results of both New York mayoral primaries touched off waves of political activity in the state 's Congressional delegation here . In the House of Representatives , several Democrats from New York City began discussing the possibility of giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Procaccino , the Democratic primary winner . Such a movement would probably not involve more than five of the 18 Democratic Representatives from the city . but it would constitute a fairly radical departure from party loyalty practices of the past . I Among the Republicans , Senator Jacob K. Javits was understood to be hopeful that he might persuade Governor Rockefeller to move away somewhat from his announced decision to support Senator Marchi and campaign for him if he won the primary . Mr. Javits will meet with Mr. , Rockefeller after the Governor returns from his South Amerlean tour , probably next Sunday . The Senator does not plan to make any formal comment on the primary results until after his conference with Mr. Rockefeller . Then he will hold a news conference . Both Senator Javits and Senator Charles E. Goodell announced during the primary campaign that they would support Mayor Lindsay , running as the Liberal nominee , if he lost the Republican primary . White House Noncommittal At the White House news briefing this afternoon , reporters tried to determine whether vice President Agnew 's statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke in his capacity as Republican National Chairman , in what capacity did Vice President Agnew speak ? " one newsman asked . " Vice President Agnew spoke in his capacity as Vice President , " Mr. Ziegler replied . " If the White House has no comment on the New York election , " a reporter continued , " does it have any comment on the Vice President ? " Mr. Ziegler remained silent , a thin smile playing over his lips , as ' he stared at the wall of his office . President Nixon is scheduled to hold a televised news conference at 7 P.M. tomorrow in the White House , and reporters will almost certainly renew their efforts then to explore his position on the New York election . There has never been any belief in the White House that the President could endorse Mayor Lindsay if he lost the RepubliAssocla fed Picas Rogers C- B. Morton lean primary , but there has been , some feeling that a carefully assumed stance of neutrality would be possible . There was considerable disappointment among some White House officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( point of view , the Marchi vicItory raised a political problem , for the President that could lhave been eliminated had the ' Mayor won . From a personal point of view , a number of Nixon aides had hoped Mr. Lindsay could win , and the Administration collectively had done its best to give him the benefit of favorable Federal publicity during the closing weeks of the campaign . Just before the primary , a prominent Nixon political adviser predicted that if Mr. Marchi won , the President would not make any decision on his own position for two months or more , probably until the fall segment of the campaign got into motion . Elsewhere in the capital , comment on the New York results varied widely . Senator Edward M. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , warned against discerning a conservative trend in the voting , noting that two-thirds of the Democrats and nearly half the Republicans had supported moderate or liberal candidates . Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana , the Democratic floor leader , said he saw in the results " a case of law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their discontent , their uneasiness and concern . " Senator . Charles H. Percy , Republican of Illinois , said he , was " most disappointed that a ! good Republcan has lost his party 's nomination . " Representative Wayne L. Hays , Democrat of Ohio , said on the floor of the House : " 1 was delighted to read in the morning press that the voters of New York finally caught up with the Mayor of New York . I know of no man during my 21 years in the House who did less and got more credit in the press . " A National Trend Seen Elsewhere in the nation a number of Republican Mayors and legislators , as well as some Democrats , analyzed Mayor Lindsay 's defeat as a reflection of strong national law-andorder sentiment . But Mayor James Tate of Philadelphia said Mayor Lindsay was defeated " by more than the law-and-order issue . " The vote , he said , " also showed discontent generally among voters and a taxpayer 's revolt and other things . " In Philadelphia , William J. Devlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote showed " people are a little more concerned about a return to an orderly process of social procedure ; they would like to see more quiescent behavior on campuses and people becoming a little less demonstrative . " Mayor Carl B. Stokes of Cleveland , a Democrat , said that Mayor Lindsay 's defeat was a great disappointment to him . " I 'm a fan of his , " he said . " Lindsay understands the problems of all the cities , not just his own . " The first Negro to be elected Mayor of a major city , Mr. Stokes said that law and order was the main issue and that it will be a major issue in Cleveland in the fall . " Hopefully , " he added . " we 've crossed this hurdle . " In Gary , Ind. , another Negro I Mayor , Richard Hatcher , ex- , ipressed disgust with the victories of the " so-called law and , order candidates " Marchi and Procaccino . Declaring that the civil rights movement in the nation was " dead , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' detention or concentration ' camps , He said that there were rumors that the Nixon Administration was spending S50-million on renovating . lob Corps centers for possible use as concentration camps . Mr. Hatcher would not say where the rumors originated . In New York State , some upstate Republicans were happy Lover the Lindsay defeat . State , Senator Earl W. Bridges , the Senate majority leader , said : " I am very high on Senator Marchi . He is one of the greatest people r have known . He is not really a way-out conservative , and people are going to like him better as he goes along . " Assemblyman Perry Duryea Jr. , Republican Speaker of the State Assembly , said that the Lindsay defeat " was part of a I continuing trend that has been in evidence nationwide for the past year . " " Law and order was an issue in both the Democratic and Republican parties , " he said . " The ' voters are saying to the candidate that they want less government spending and a little more law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders was mixed . Former Gov . Robert B. Meyner , the Democratic nominee for Governor , said he did not believe the result reflected a conservative trend . " If you add up the supporters of those candidates with liberal propensities , you find the conservatives outvoted 2 to 1 , " he said . And Paterson 's Mayor Lawrence F. Kramer , a Lindsay type of Republican running for re-election , said that " everybody is overreacting , trying to read something significant into it the vote that is n't there . " " I am convinced more than ever that John Lindsay can be elected , " he said . " Thank heavens , the man is still a candidate . " Mayor Hugh J. Addonizio of Newark said that the primary outcome showed that " there is more pressure to move from a moderate position to a more rigid law-and-order posture . " Connecticut 's Republican national committeeman , John Alsop , called the Lindsay defeat " incredible . " He said that " there was a clear manifestation of a movement toward the right , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Republican chairman , Theodore DiLorenzo , said that " the lesson applicable to Hartford , or to any city , is that you can not represent just one segment of the city ; you 've got to represent all segments . " Gov . Francis W. Sargent of Massachusetts said : " I hope that Mayor Lindsay , as one of the most articulate members of our party , will not be lost to our party . This shows that New York is a tough battle ground , and emphasizes the plight of the cities . " Mayor Jerome P. Cavanagh of Detroit , a Democrat , remarked that the New York vote " shows a trend all around the country . " He added : " It 's a swing to conservatism , a simplistic response people seem to want to very difficult questions . " Another Democrat , Mayor Kevin White of Boston , said : " I have great sympathy for John Lindsay 's plight . This is a nonpartisan sentiment . Lindsay was handicapped by the challenge of having to solve a great many problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a big city . " Thomas J. D'Alesandro , Baltimore 's Democratic Mayor , saw Mayor Lindsay 's defeat as a rejection of his administration rather than a swing to the right .
