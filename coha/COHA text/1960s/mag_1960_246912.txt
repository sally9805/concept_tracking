THE LAW AND THE PROFITS ( 246 pp. ) -C . Northcote Parkinson - Houghton Mifflin ( $3.50 ) . <P> During World War II , a chairborne British army officer was assigned to a secret project " not essential to winning the war . " In command was an air admiral , assisted by a full colonel , assisted by a major . Fourth in line was Captain Parkinson . One day the admiral was sent on a mission , the colonel went on leave , and the major was taken sick . Left in full charge , Captain Parkinson found that he did all of the project 's work in an hour . <P> Actually , C. ( for Cyril ) Northcote Parkin son had discovered the most intriguing fact about the apple since Newton - how many bureaucrats it takes to polish it . <P> Put in its now classic form , Parkinson 's Law ( TIME , Oct. 28 , 1957 ) holds that " work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion , " ergo , an organization 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Author Parkinson also bantered entertainingly on how to tell somebodies from nobodies at cocktail parties ( the somebodies come late and shun walls ) , how institutions achieve perfection of layout just before collapsing , and how the deliberations of any finance committee " will be in inverse proportion to the sum involved . " The Law and the Profits , well illustrated by Cartoonist Robert C. Osborn , is twice as long and half as funny . Grappling with the tax spiral and inane bureaucratic waste , the onetime Raffles Professor of History at the University of Malaya has understandably lost some of his donnish laughter . <P> Epic Tax Dodge . Parkinson 's Second Law- " Expenditure rises to meet income " - is scarcely a novel blockhead buster . <P> Still most governments , as Parkinson says , are too blockheaded to learn it . The power to tax creates the illusion of limitless income , and nations blissfully spend themselves into bankruptcy . France 's Ancien Regime bled its life away in red ink before a single head fell under the guillotine . <P> Like certain poisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the peacetime national tax passes 10% , people begin to take evasive action ( in Parkinson 's view , the Book of Exodus is the story of an epic tax dodge ) . At about 25% , inflation debases the currency . Over 35% , taxes are alms for oblivion ; the nation is carting itself to history 's junkpile . <P> Taxes sap the vigor of a country , says Parkinson , since the proceeds are almost totally wasted . In the old unsophisticated days , kings spent the money on banquets and concubines , and then biology , at least , imposed fiscal limits . But the modern bureau with its research analysts and printing presses gobbles up limitless funds - with no fun to show for it . The life cycle of a bureau is ruled by one law : " It spends and therefore is . " In one of the skits with which Author Parkinson enlivens his chronicle , he pictures a breathless female statistician rushing in to the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture 's office , bearing one of the thousands of pamphlets the Government publishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the latest-Teenage Girls Discuss Their Wardrobes-and what a smart cover ! We asked them whether they bought their own clothes or whether they took their mothers along to the store . <P> Mr. Sec. : Gee , that 's quite an idea ! And what did they answer ? She : Some take their mothers . Some don't.
