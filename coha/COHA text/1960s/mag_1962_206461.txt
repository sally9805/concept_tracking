SAY NOTHING ( 217 pp. ) - James Han-ley-Horizon ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> This bitter , brittle work has the qualities of a Byzantine mosaic . Its characters are rigidly , severely drawn ; its setting is in " a tight house in a tight town where night has the depth of caves and daylight has no arch . " It is written in a stream of harsh-sounding consonants , and its dialogue is a succession of jagged-edged monosyllables . Altogether , it is a novel calculated not to warm the reader but to awe him-a familiar feat for British Novelist James Hanley , 61 , whose past novels have won him critical , but not popular , acclaim for their cold fury . Herbert Read has called Hanley a " great realist. " and C. P. Snow writes that for " sheer power he is not surpassed by any contemporary .

The three go to Tom 's cemetery instead of church . " Crawl up the cross ! " Winifred orders Mrs. Baines at the site of the grave . " Cry , you bitch , cry . " Mrs. Baines obliges , while Wrinifred claws hysterically at the grave . But the rest of the week Mrs. Baines rules the household . She brutally orders her Milquetoast husband about , refuses to be in the same room with Winifred . A bad case of Calvinist repression , will-less Joshua can not even bring himself to say " I want . " His only solace is the Bible and the thought of death . Mrs. Baines consoles him : " Think of a day when you 're nothing , Mr. Baines . Nothing . " <P> When the family takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' isolation . He asks why there are no newspapers or radio . why the windows are always sealed and the doors bolted . " We 're right inside ourselves , " Mrs. Baines explains , " and nobody 'll ever get in and pull us out . " The lodger lures Joshua and Winifred out for walks , but they can not wait to get back to punishing and being punished . <P> But there are occasional glimpses of their pathetic longing for a better life . For all his disgust , the lodger finds it difficult to leave this house , and so , implies Hanley . would anybody . For this is no unique madhouse ; as Author Hanley sees it , it is the human condition .
