 |p543  OUR EXPRESS from the Italian mainland rolled across the 21/2-mile causeway and glided to a halt . " Venezia ! Venezia ! " The barrel-chested porter chucked our bags to the platform . " All out ! " We emerged into an airy waiting room of colorful murals , smooth bright walls , and a huge expanse of glass . Surprised at the severely modern building , my wife remarked , " This does n't look like Venice ! " But the porter was already shouldering his way down broad steps to a marble landing . Casually , as if calling up a taxicab at any station curb in the world , he motioned us to a gondola that danced expectantly on a wide street of water , the Grand Canal . Then he turned and pointed across it . " Over there , signora , " he said . " That 's Venice ... ah , bellissima ! " Most beautiful indeed ! " Over there " stood the fabulous old city of Venice ? the centro Venice TVILIGHTED SPLENDOR FLOATS SERENE AMID A TIDE OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? rising magically from the rippling waters , as unreal as a fairy tale and as beautifully bizarre as the daydream of a drowsing schoolboy . Across the canal the late morning sun drove the last cobwebs of mist from rusty roof tiles , glinted from the dome of the Church of San Simeone Piccolo , and scattered golden darts from the gilded carvings of 16th-century palaces . The city of a hundred islands glowed like a handful of old jewels against the velvet of the Adriatic Sea . " Yes , " we agreed . " Bellissima . " Not long afterward , I stood with Conte Andrea di Valmarana on the third-floor balcony of his 300-year-old palazzo . The count rested a fragile demitasse on the thick stone balustrade and gazed thoughtfully out over the canal-threaded maze .

" But not even a Venetian can tell you how to understand our city , " he said . " To know Venice , you must see it all for yourself . " " When , with our friend and guide Umberto Tessarin , we set out to see for ourselves , we headed for the throbbing three-acre Piazza San Marco , through which pass literally millions of visitors a year . " Everything begins and ends in the Piazza , " Umberto remarked . Picking our way through the throngs , we stopped to sip tiny cups of black , bitter coffee at Florian 's . This delightfully ornate cafe has  |p544  been celebrated in painting and prose since it was founded in 1720 . We took seats with other patrons amid a thousand brightly painted metal chairs and tables outside the cafe . Orchestras Vie for an Audience Across the sunny Piazza , rows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near-by Lavena . The square echoed to two outdoor orchestras playing for customers having late-morning coffee at 40 cents a cup . Ideally , the two take turns , but occasionally the light opera favored by Florian 's blended in extravagant discord with the popular tunes bouncing from the orchestra stand outside the Quadri . Listeners moved back and forth to applaud first one group of musicians and then the other . " That 's how you can tell the Venetians from the tourists , " our waiter volunteered as he put down a check for 500 lire ? the equivalent of 80 cents . " The Venetians stand and listen for nothing . They 've already had their coffee down at the corner for 40 lire . " I leaned back lazily in the warm sun . " I was here once in the winter , " I remarked . " It was so foggy the pigeons must have used radar to fly across the square . " " Ah , the winter , yes ! " the waiter continued . He wore the air , common to all Venetians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . " You should have been here last winter when we had the bora , the great wind . The tide rose into the streets . Water spurted up through the pavement right here . The police had to erect passerelle ? elevated wooden walks ? across the Piazza . Men wore high rubber boots to their offices . " It happens every year . But soon every  |p545  thing is the same again ? or about the same . " Now , squinting into the sunlight on Piazza San Marco , I felt the waiter was right . All was the same or about the same . Venice remains uniquely Venice . A thousand years of history have unrolled here since traveling merchant-adventurers stole the body of St. Mark in Alexandria and brought it to Venice , and the great cathedral was begun to serve as his tomb . Here , on the basilica 's high facade , rear the magnificent bronze horses that Venice took from Constantinople in 1204 ( page 551 ) ; here , carved in red porphyry , stand the statues of the tetrarchs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The cathedral 's mosaics of gold and red and blue and green glass , glittering in the sun , were begun in the 13th century . Eventually there arose the adjacent clock tower , on which a winged lion disports against a star-speckled background of deep blue ; the pink and white Palace of the Doges floating airily on Gothic arches ; the arcaded palaces of the procurators ; and the soaring , 323-foot bell tower that overlooks all Venice . Birds Descend as Bell Strikes Hour For ten centuries artisans from many lands labored on the Piazza San Marco , ringing it with a riot of stone angels , golden spires and cupolas , broad domes and lacy curlicues . Bedizened and fantastic beyond comparison , it became a hodgepodge of styles , a farrago of untidy ideas . Yet , under the steel-blue Venetian sky , it in some way holds together as one of the supremely beautiful things in the world , a great and lovely stage set in which the cafe chairs merely add the harmony of an abstract  |p549  painting . Even the hordes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most familiar with San Marco 's famous pigeons is Giuseppe Milan , who even then was walking across the great square with a red bucket full of corn and bird seed . " They are smart , these birds , " he told me . " They know when the clock is about to strike . " Overhead the restless whistle of wings increased and the sky literally darkened . Then , as the bell of the clock tower boomed , the birds descended in a churning melee while Giuseppe poured grain in a circle on the stones . The pigeons , heirs of birds the doges long ago released on Palm Sundays , will eat from your hand or perch on your head in their greedy haste . They are perhaps the most photographed birds in the world ( page 552 ) . Umberto and I made our way across the Piazza to the historic Porta della Carta .

" There are only about fifty qualified guides in all Venice , " he said . " You must pass a stiff examination to become one .

You must know our great artists ? Titian , Giovanni Bellini , Giorgione , Canaletto , Veronese . In such a treasure house as this , it takes years of study , let me tell you . And then you get some tourist in a hurry who must see in an hour what took centuries to create ! " Sighing for the lost days of Venice 's glory , he left us abruptly when potential customers approached , guidebooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our friend might have described how Venice entered upon her long decline in the 16th century . She could not survive the loss of her trade after Vasco da Gama found a new route , to the Orient around Africa . She lost her land possessions in the eastern Mediterranean to the Turks . At the last , Napoleon Bonaparte brought the Republic down in 1797 . Thereafter ? save for a brief year and a half of revolt in 1848-49 ? she was ruled from the mainland , first by Austria , finally by Italy . Today the modern city of Venice has ex-panded to the mainland and includes the fast-growing factory area and port of Marghera . The over-all Venetian population exceeds 300,000 , but the old island bastion that the world still thinks of as Venice remains a water-ringed core of shops , theaters , churches , hotels , museums , and crowded dwellings , with a dwindling population of around 175,000 .

" Pietro sculled us gracefully through narrow canals ? Venetian " back streets " average about 12 feet wide and three or four deep at low tide ? and past buildings that recalled famous names of other days . In this house , Lord Byron fell in love with the wife of an aging nobleman . In that one , marked with a plaque , Browning breathed his last .

Also the subject of gossip and sometimes of ridicule was another , later Venetian , a self-proclaimed great lover and adventurer of the 18th century named Casanova . Expelled from a religious school on charges of immorality , Giacomo Girolamo Casanova de Seingalt fled Venice to begin his heady career in Rome . He became the terror of European boudoirs , " always involved in some affair of the cabala , or of gambling . .. or of love . " Returning to Venice in the 1750 's , he made the mistake of trifling with the favorite mistress of one of the powerful city fathers . Promptly condemned to the supposedly escape-proof state prison , he escaped 15 months later and returned to France to direct a lottery and make a fortune . Yes , many famous ghosts haunt the liquid streets of Venice ! Many Woods Make Up a Gondola Pietro rowed on skillfully , and we came to the shipyard of the Cooperativa Daniele Manin . There half a dozen workmen had two gondolas under construction . Uniquely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city today ? there were 10,000 of them in the 1500 's . So exactly do they match the needs of this water-threaded metropolis that they can go anywhere in its hundreds of miles of narrow canals . Each 1,300-pound craft is 36 feet long and 4 feet wide , and the right side is 10 inches shorter than the left to counteract the sweep ( If the gondolier 's oar . The bows invariably end in a steel ferro , shaped somewhat like a huge musical clef , that helps balance the weight of the gondolier at his stern position . " Look , " one of the workmen said , pointing to a narrow strip of wood running along the side of one craft . " This is cherry wood . Over here , mahogany , and there , abete ? spruce or fir . " He pointed to the forcola , the oddly shaped fork against which the oar is maneuvered . " Carved by hand from a single block of walnut , " he said . " It takes time and money to build a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fittings , leather seats , carpets , a canopy ? and maybe a vase for flowers ? you pay about $1,700 . " In the old days , a good gondola lasted thirty years . Today , no . You are lucky if it lasts twenty , because of the motorboats in the canals . They kick up waves that batter your gondola . " Theoretically , he told me , the speed limit is nine kilometers ? roughly five miles ? an hour . But everyone seems to go as fast as he cares to , which gives the power boats a distinct edge . Mooring Poles Bear Family Colors These days , gondolas are largely for visitors . Many hire them to go on moonlight serenades , preceded by a brilliantly lighted barge carrying musicians and singers along the Grand Canal . The Venetians , who should be blase about such things by now , gather on bridges to cheer or perhaps to jeer if the music is not to their taste . Venice 's ornate palazzos were built in the days when everybody rode in gondolas , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canal today . Palace entrances are still marked by graceful mooring poles striped with the family colors ( page 546 ) . Anyone wishing to install a new mooring pole must obtain a special license from the city . Guidebooks usually list 70 to 100 notable structures among a total of at least 500 palazzos . The majority have proved so costly to maintain that they have become museums , government offices , antique shops , or apartments . But a few still shelter the descendants of the families that built them . Others have been purchased as homes by foreigners . Years ago a wealthy American secured a firm place in the hearts of the Venetians by willing a house to each of her gondoliers . Today 's Veneto-American is typified by Peggy Guggenheim , American heiress and art expert , who owns an 18th-century palazzo nicknamed Incompiuto , or " unfinished , " because it never progressed above the first floor .  |p558  The going price for Grand Canal palazzos , incidentally , ranges from $80,000 to $100,000 ; rentals average $400 to $500 a month . Our guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by birth , who prefers to live in a modern apartment , but who persuaded friends to open the big carved doors of their canalside homes for me in the interest of research into Venetian life . Except for the addition of modern conveniences , few changes have been made in the venerable palazzo of Conte Alvise Giustiniani . The forty-room mansion follows the classic Venetian tradition , with a long barnlike hallway on the first floor and with entries from land and canal . " They were merchants , you know , " the contessa explained . " Here is where they stored their goods . " A majestic stairway led to a vast secondfloor hall . Off it opened big , square living rooms , libraries , salons , and bedrooms , with walls of gold brocade , handsomely painted ceilings , and tall windows overlooking the Canale della Giudecca , where transatlantic liners anchor almost at the palazzo doorstep .

" " How did they keep these big rooms warm in the old days ? " I asked . " They did n't , " the contessa said . " They wore more clothes then , but they also froze . " Wheels Rare in a City of Bridges Where there are canals , there must be bridges . In our wanderings , I am sure Umberto led us over most of Venice 's 400 or so spans , from the Bridge of Sighs and the shoplined Ponte di Rialto to modest little arches so low the gondoliers must crouch and doff their hats to get under them . Another thing : Venetian bridges , unlike their counterparts elsewhere , invariably have steps . Garbage collectors and delivery boys with pushcarts solve the problem of these ubiquitous stairs by using a projecting set of small wheels with which they jockey their vehicles up and down . Once , I was told , the city tried building a bridge without steps , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rebuilt in traditional style . Venice has another and more baffling peculiarity : The houses are numbered not by streets but in numerical order within each of the six sestieri , or city districts . A stranger finds it all but impossible to find his destination without a guide . I knew , for example , that 5199 Corte della Carita lay within a hundred yards of a certain bridge . But when I tried to go there , I had to ask directions from 12 different persons , including a woman who had lived near by for 17 years but did n't know . A wine dealer at the corner had never heard of the number , although I eventually found it only a hundred feet away . One day my wife and I visited the home of our gondolier .

" The income of most Venetians depends , in one way or another , on the tourist trade , although many from the old city go each day to factories in Mestre , on the mainland , where they earn $90 or more a month . Perhaps the best-paid workers in all Venice are the master glass blowers on the neighboring island of Murano , who may get $50 a week or more . Ten of them work around the big furnace at the Venini glass factory , each of them twirling and blowing and cutting colored lumps of molten glass with unbelievable speed and skill . Each is an individualist ? Boboli specializes in statuettes , Homeless cats bask in a sunlit alley . Thousands swarm through the city , living vagabond lives on handouts .

" The big , star-filled eyes looked at me with surprise , and perhaps pity . " Money ! " he answered . " What else ? " Venice is famed , too , for its handmade laces , including the exquisite Point de Venise . Women and girls do most of the work , either at home on near-by Burano or at that island 's lacemaking school . Sixty girls may work on one tablecloth , which will sell for $5,000 . Other skills still flourish in small city shops . Giuseppe Orio laughed with self-contained delight when Umberto and I peered into his small , smoke-blackened smithy . " More tourists !

" Advice to Diners : Go to the Market Followed by Giuseppe 's laughter and a hungry yellow cat , we walked on to the big public market near the Rialto Bridge . Some of the best restaurants in Venice ? but by no means the most expensive ? lie near the market . We trailed two merchants in white aprons to a narrow street dotted with cafes , and found a sidewalk table shaded by a red-and-white-striped awning and a cluster of tall yellow flowers . The calamaretti , bitesize fried squid , arrived crisp and hot with a sliver of lemon . We sampled bisato ? eel grilled on a wood fire ? and finished with thin , crisp pancakes sprinkled with sugar , called galani , and a glass of white wine . Half an hour later Umberto and I pushed on through streets now crowded and dripping under a sudden shower . " Do n't go too fast , " he warned . " When people meet in the rain in these narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twilight Splendor 561 umbrella and who lowers it , or there 's a collision . Here , go right . " I turned ahead of him into a two-foot-wide space between buildings . This was Ramo Salizzada Zusto , just wide enough for a single file to the next thoroughfare , 55 feet away . " I used to go through here every morning to school , " Umberto said . " I was late half the time , because I had to wait here for a break in the traffic coming toward me before I could duck through . " Traffic Stops Where Canals Begin Past the Church of San Simeone Grande we emerged onto a wide curb of the Grand Canal . A small boy sat crying . He had dropped his huge red ball into the water . Now he watched helplessly as it floated away . As we looked , the pilot of a big water bus skillfully swerved his craft toward us , so that the waves from his bow carried the ball back into the boy 's outstretched hands . Bystanders cheered , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station that links Venice to the mainland . Not far away rose the Autorimessa , the city 's huge canalside bus terminal and parking garage . Beyond there , wheels may not go . I was reminded of Robert Benchlev 's classic reaction to his first glimpse of the Queen of the Adriatic . " STREETS FULL OF WATER , " he cabled home . " PLEASE ADVISE . " In a concrete way these two structures represent a serious dilemma facing the city . The problem is this : Plans have been advanced for building a modern business center ? a " little Manhattan " ? in an unattractive area alongside the bus and railroad terminals . The center would provide much-needed office space . But the idea was torpedoed , at least temporarily , by protests of Venetians opposed to anything that might change the character of their city . Still another plan stems from the undeniable fact that Venice , far from being dead commercially , ranks as Italy 's third greatest port , after Genoa and Naples . Its proponents see their city as standing midway between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetite for oil of , say , West Germany . To make their dream a reality , they have already planned a huge new  |p562  petroleum terminal south of Mestre , on the near-by mainland . But the problem of modernization remains , as does the controversy over the city 's entire future . Venice perches on countless thousands of wooden piles , 12-foot-long oak and larch trunks driven into the mud islands and topped by thick planks and stone foundations . These proved satisfactorily sturdy until the arrival of the gasoline engine ; since then , the steady pounding of waves kicked up by motorboats in the canals has damaged many fine buildings . Draining canals and repairing foundations ? the average canal must be dammed and drained every decade to relieve it of accumulated filth ? costs close to half a million dollars a year . One canal , on which is located the only traffic light in Venice , recently was closed for more than two years because of the slowness of repairs . And Venice has maintenance problems other than watery . Every visitor discovers for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city , but few stop to ask if any of them eventually topple . They do . Thirty of the two hundred or so brick bell towers that have spiked the Venetian skyline at one time or another have ended by collapsing dramatically . When a particularly large tower crumbled into the Grand Canal a couple of hundred years ago , the crash kicked up such a wave that an entire flotilla of gondolas came to rest 562  |p566  in a neighboring square . And the solidly built bell tower of San Marco came apart gently but completely one July day in 1902 ? at ten in the morning , solemnly declares an inscription on the famous tower , which was rebuilt within ten years " as it was and where it was . " Nor are toppling towers the only largescale perils with which harassed city engineers must contend . The centro storico sinks a tenth to a twelfth of an inch every year . Venetians are apt to blame this on a variety of illogical causes : earthquakes ; industrial activities on the mainland ; deepening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raises rather than lowers levels of the canals . The real answer probably lies in the simple fact that buildings perched on wooden pilings , which rest in turn on a layer of soft mud , are apt to sink slowly of their own weight . But these are long-range problems . In the meantime there remains the immediate question : Shall Venice be a museum or a modern city ? " Once you start to fix some of these old buildings , " a city technical expert remarked , " vouspend millions and millions of lire . Everybody agrees that our art treasures must be preserved as they are , but how can the entire city remain unchanged ? " An active advocate of maintaining Venice 's ancient character is the local chapter of Italia Nostra , a society dedicated to preserving the nation 's artistic treasures . It believes the city 's future is an international problem . " Venice belongs to the world , " the society proclaimed recently . " People everywhere should help in preserving it . " Lanfranco Caniato , the society 's slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his law office overlooking the stone pavements of Campo Sant ' Angelo . " Right there , " he said , pointing to the opposite side of the square , " was once a 15th-century bell tower , an old church , and a unique little house with beam supports , leaning over the street . In 1810 Napoleon decided the Church of St. Angelo should be razed to make the campo more spacious . Children Play in Square and Street Without Fear of Automobiles Behind the marbled palaces of the Grand Canal and the splendors of St. Mark 's Square lies a Venice of villages , each centered around a small campo , or square , with its own church , cafes , shops , and open-air market .

" Caniato believes the Italian Government should declare Venice a national monument , so that exterior changes in any building , even for the addition of a bathroom , would have to be approved by the Department of Antiquities and Fine Arts . Arturo Deana , who arrived in Venice in 1916 as a waiter and now owns the well-known Colomba restaurant , speaks for a more moderate viewpoint . " The city missed a great opportunity a few years ago when it refused to permit Frank Lloyd Wright to design a new building in the Venetian spirit on the Grand Canal , " Signor Deana told me . " But I do n't want to see the character of the city changed . I 'm opposed to  |p569  these plans for floodlighting the Piazza San Marco and for erecting modern office buildings . In Milan , it is okay . In Venice , no ! " To which Dr. Romeo Parisotto , vice-director of the central tourist office , added : " Visitors spend some $33,000,000 here each year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no tourists . " The controversy over a minimum of m o d - ernization or no modernization at all is likely to be a long one . When I went to say goodbye to Conte Valmarana , I asked him how he stood on the question of the city 's future . " If modernization means automobiles and tall office buildings ? no , " Valmarana replied firmly . " But to be a museum is to die . We must always be a unique , living city in the modern world .
