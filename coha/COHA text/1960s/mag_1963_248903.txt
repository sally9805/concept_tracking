" Mme. Nhu , " declared California 's Governor Pat Brown in the understatement of the month , " is a controversial figure . She is not the first to visit California , nor will she be the last . I urge all Californians to act like civilized Americans and let the lady have her say . " But for all the Governor 's pleas , a number of protest groups pursued their plans to give the lady a hostile welcome . <P> On the East Coast , at just about the same time , another controversial visitor to the U.S. , Yugoslavia 's President Tito , gathered his 28-man party onto an ocean liner and bade the U.S. farewell . <P> <P> As it turned out , neither the madame nor the marshal was much of a success during the final days of their visits . <P> The Madame . At luncheons and press conferences , South Viet Nam 's Mme. Nhu continued to air her grievances against the U.S. In Chicago she termed the U.S. withdrawal of financial aid to Viet Nam 's Special Forces a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pilgrimage to Neiman-Marcus ' famed department store in Dallas , lunched at the city 's rooftop Ports O ' Call Restaurant , and was guest of honor at a Texas-sized blowout at the Bee County ranch of Millionaire Dudley T. Dougherty , who keeps an oil well in his front yard . <P> Whisking westward next day , Mme. Nhu stopped off for a talk in Phoenix and then waded into Pat Brown 's excitable California for appearances in Los Angeles , San Francisco and Berkeley . This week she concludes her 21-day grand tour of the U.S. <P> The Marshal . For his part , it was Marshal Tito 's presence , rather than his words , that lent excitement to his visit . Tito 's address to the United Nations General Assembly was a ho-hum , all-things-to-all-men bid for continued ways to reach peaceful coexistence . <P> His presence in New York City , however , made nervous wrecks of police and security officials . A couple of anti-Tito Yugoslavs managed to slip into the Waldorf-Astoria and make their way to Tito 's 35th floor-where they were promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three Tito aides ; in the scuffle , one of Tito 's men ended up with a bruised jaw . And outside the Waldorf , six demonstrators paraded in Halloween skeleton costumes , hauling a chariot bearing skeletons and a whip-cracking man dressed as Tito . Angered , Tito canceled a reception for 1,200 guests . " The reason for this , " said Tito 's communique , " is the failure of the competent authorities ... to undertake adequate security measures in connection with the reception . " Replied New York 's Police Commissioner Michael Murphy : " Sheer , unadulterated nonsense . " <P> <P> At week 's end , as he and his party boarded the S.S. Rotterdam , Tito got a noisy send-off from his own U.N . delegation and from a band of uninvited demonstrators . Exuding good will , the boss of Yugoslavia extended his best wishes to the American people " for their well-being and further progress , and also to express my hope that normal friendly relations marked by stability will prevail . " With that , the gangplank was raised , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the U.S. State Department sighed with relief .
