txt A marketing war here in the Sooner State is giving whiskey merchants a monumental hangover  --  and booze buyers a lot of nifty bargains . Consider A fifth of Scotch ( Johnny Walker Red Label ) sold for 56 59 at the Fifth Avenue Liquor Store here four months ago : today it goes for $5 37 . In Tulsa , a fifth of bourbon Jim Beam ) cost 54 85 at the Fifth &; Boston Liquor Store in September , now it 's pricetagged at just $3 88 . And even these prices can be beaten , if you shop around enough . This price-slashing is part of a brawl here for a place in the state 's new liquor retailing industry . After 52 years of being legally on the wagon . Oklahomans voted last April to repeal state prohibition and thus paved the way for creation of a legitimate liquor-selling trade . But when legal liquor actually began to flow in September . a muddle over how to market the stuff , under some peculiar state laws , touched off a retailing ruckus that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , that state authorities now are threatening to fix prices and otherwise tighten their control on the industry . Some Unusual Practices Oklahoma novel retailing laws are perhaps of more than parochial interest . While they directly affect only wholesalers , distributors and retailers of liquor , they also prescribe some rather unusual and quaint trade practices that conceivably could be applied to other businesses as well . F'or instance ' The laws are aimed at encouraging competition but the clear intent is to discourage traditional merchandising . Thus retailers are banned by law from advertising or using promotional displays , or out of their stores . The result : Liquor stores in this state are a sober sight indeed . No spotlights or other attention-getters are allowed . Only one , non-neon sign with letters limited to four inches in height is permitted . The sign ca n't tell the nape , of the store , it can only intimate in no nun e than four words that alcoholic beverages ate available inside . While inside displays am harmed , authorities recently ruled that cem all Christmas decorations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts are taboo , as are liquor store chains . Retailet - must keep written records of every bottle sold The state forbids " local " liquor advertising in newspapers . " Local " advertising is placed le local merchants , who pay at least part of the cost and put their name on the ads . " National " liquor advertising , placed by distillers , or by wnolesalers as their representatives , is permitted . The ban on usual methods of promotion . 40111C liquor sellers say , has led them to rely heavily on price-cutting to try to boost sales . Limited Lines Under a franchise agreement , a wholesaler handles limited lutes of liquor in an exclusive territory . Under Oklahoma law .

Retailers in Tulsa. and Okmulgee , protest . ing " chaotic " conditions , are demanding that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board steady stumbling prices , which a new regulation gives it the power to do for up to 90 days at a stretch . The A.13 C. unit has , In fact , issued regulations that , In effect , tell liquor dealers to raise their prices or the A.B C. hoard will do it for them These regulations go Into effect this month but their impact is unpredictable . Slake Is Sizable The state has a big stake In the liquor fracas . As of December 22. liquor taxes poured $5,07R , file into the state 's coffers , more money in less than four months than some earlier estimates for an entire year . And that figure does n't Include state sales taxes , which boost the total to date well past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gallon . more than any adjacent state except Arkansas . The bottle battle has knocked down retail battle began on the wholesale level even before legal liquor sales started , industry people here say . One big wholesaler here , Wines &; Spirits of Oklahoma , Inc. , sent its price lists to retailers shortly before the deadline for filing wholesale prices with the A B.C. board . The lists showed markups in the range of 7% , instead of the roughly 12% which other wholesalers planned to charge , and resulted in hasty price hacking by Wines &; Spirits ' competitors . " %Vele operating at a very low overhead , " says Torn Alilam , seated behind a plain desk in a loft of his Famous Brands warehouse here . ' " But if I thought we were n't going to be able to raise prices . " he adds , " I 'd shut down right now . " His whiskey sales , he says , are based on markups as low as 6.5% instead of the 11% to 12% he figures he needs to operate profitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , " he says . His pessimistic view is backed by a St. Louis University study of more than 400 liquor wholesalers around the U.S. The study failed to find a single one who had operated profitably at the ** to 7% markups common among Oklahoma wholesalers . In spite of shaky profits , few , if any , wholesalers or retailers have sworn off liquor selling so far . But observers figure the day of reckoning may be June 30 , when the $600-a-year state licenses expire . A retailer who finds himself operating in the red probably will give careful thought to shunning liquor entirely instead of saddling himself with a $1,254 burden  --  a $600 state fee , $600 city occupation tax and $54 Federal fee . The state 's roughly 750 retailers are finding they not only have to battle each other for profits , but the remnants of an army of bootleggers as well . Keen price competition is saving bootleggers a trip to neighboring states ; they now buy their booze from price-slashing Oklahoma re tailers and peddle it after hours and Sundays for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some , however , are meeting prices of some retaile.rs . A dealer who has cut prices " but not to the bone , grumbles , " A customer of mine says he can get a case of Canadian Club from his bootlegger at almost exactly my retail price  --  and the bootlegger delivers it to his house . It 's against the law for me to deliver . "
