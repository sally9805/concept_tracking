The Greenwich Village Independent Democrats decided to support Humphrey after all . To dignify their retreat , a spokesman quoted . . . guess who ? " ' In this absurd world , the only thing one can do is make choices . ' Hubert Humphrey is not my choice . But . . . . " One hardly needs Camus for that kind of reasoning . But if he speaks now from the grave , as he does virtually Lyrical and Critical Essays by Albert Camus Translated by Ellen Conroy Kennedy ( Alfred A. Knopf ; $6.95 ) every day , it is usually in this way : to confer some sort of nobility on other men 's positions or prose . His reputation seems more and more honorific ; his work has been carved up into quotations ? a kind of Bartlett 's of liberal piety , which now only awaits an edition . During their famous fight , Sartre said that Camus carried a " portable pedestal . " This was partly true , just as it is partly true to say that Sartre has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mount , the best ones stand upon the image of their self-esteem . But if unduly cruel , Sartre 's remark has proved prophetic . If it is hard to think about Camus anymore , it is partly because one has lost sight of the writer inside the statue . A good way to begin thinking about Camus again is by reading this new collection of essays . The " lyrical " part contains his first two books ? L'Envers et L'Endroit ( The Wrong Side and the Right Side ) and Noces ( Nuptials ) ? which he wrote in his middle 20 'S after a recurrence of tuberculosis , and which are often so bleak or ardent in feeling , despite their diffuseness , that they immediately begin to reveal the human clay beneath the bronze . Written attimes in imitation of the self-commemorative poetic meditation which is virtually a genre of French prose ( " If it is true that the only paradises are those we have lost , I know what name to give the tender and inhuman something that dwells in me today " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the stylish glove . The essay that begins on the above note ends on this one : " But I must break this too limp and easy curve of the absurd . I need my lucidity . . . . It 's men who complicate things . Do n't let them tell us any stories . Do n't let them say about the man condemned to death : ' He is going to pay his debt to society , ' but : ' They 're going to chop his head off . ' It may seem like nothing . But it does make a little diffeience . There are some people who prefer to look their destiny straight in the eye . " The last statement is no mere gesture . At 24 , Camus 's " destiny " was staring coldly back at him , and even his elegant paradoxes were bitterly true . Not much has been written about Camus ' youth , but he appears to have been one of those vital , able , manly kids who raise themselves in the slums . His father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by working as a maid . His revolts began early . From his family 's poverty and sadness he escaped to the Algerian beaches whose sunlight and surf , as he claimed , molded his spirit . A talented swimmer and boxer , he was also the goalkeeper on a crack soccer team by the time he was 15 . Despite his family 's illiteracy he was a star pupil , moving from scholarship to scholarship until he became the protege of the philosopher and stylist Jean Grenier . When he was 17 he came down with tuberculosis and rebelled against that too : he completed his course in philosophy , married at 20 and also became the lightweight champion of Algiers . But at 23 his tuberculosis recurred . This harsh confrontation of so much vitality and appa:rent fatality lies directly behind the life-death dialectic that forms the theme of these first two books . From the start , as throughout his career , Camus felt more lucidly than he reasoned . His ideas were the home truths of his experience , linked less by logic than by their emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never seen anyone die , " as he put it , " for the ontological argument . " Just as his theme of the absurd came directly from his life , so did its resolution ? the conquering indifference in which he had been raised . His emotions had been shaped by his mother 's detachment and solitude as surely as his physical elan was nurtured by the climate and mores . of Algiers . He writes of her as weak-minded and inarticulate . She apparently had been brainwashed by her own ; mother , who raised Camus and who liked to make him say , in company , that he loved his grandmother more than his mother . Loving his mother so passionately and hopelessly ( " she has never hugged or kissed me , for she would n't know how " ) , Camus always felt himself to be enclosed within her isolation and indifference . In the 1957 preface to The Wrong Side , he writes that his real work will begin only when he has rewritten this first book and placed at its center " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rediscover a justice or a love to match this silence . " All of which gives a seriousness and poignancy to these youthful meditations on the divided aspect of being . His first essay , " Irony , " presents three sharp descriptions of the " horrible and dirty adventure of dying , " as he later puts it : a moribund , clinging old . woman whom her daughter and boyfriend desert to go to the movies , leaving her THE NEW REPUBLIC in the darkness that is " her only hope " and with the " God she loves so poorly " ; an old cafe chatterer who realizes that the end has come because there is no one left in the world who wants to listen to him ; and finally , Camus ' grandmother who is rudely overtaken by the death whose imminence she has been feigning . Her death redeems nothing ; the only thing about it that moves him is the radiance of the winter afternoon on which she is buried , whose serene and remote sky points up the sordid negations he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think against the grain , to station himself in the " steady breeze blowing in from the dark horizon of his future " that his Meurseult discovers only as his life is ending . Struggling for an affirmation that is completely free of hope , he views himself as the uprooted stranger he discovers during a week of utter solitude in Prague , climaxed by a man dying alone in an adjacent room in his hotel , and during a week in Italy , whose warm , bare countryside revives his love of life and connects it to his despair . Nothing of his daily existence in Algiers is allowed to intrude , for he wishes to strip himself of the familiar and secure , of the little acquiescences and hopes on which he , like other men , study and work and marry , on which humanity gets by . Thus , he is drawn to the inhuman : his mother 's " animal silence , " the depraved gleam in the eyes of a cat that has been eating the litter she could not feed , the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world " has melted away , taken with it the illusion that life begins each morning . " In the inhuman he finds both his terror and his peace : the majestic indifference of the earth supplements his mother 's " lesson " as the model for his own point of stillness between no and yes , between the wrong side of the world and the right . " The great courage is still to stare as squarely at the light as at death . " His strength lies in his power of acceptance : not of death but of responsibility for the attitude in which he approaches it , for the whole individual who exists before the trauma tears him apart . Despite this strength , despite the moments of joy that sustain it , The Wrong Side is a bleak book , as lonely in the writing as in the subject . Its disjunctions of mood and image are more convincing than the rhetoric that connects them : Camus ' voice grows confident only when it becomes ironic . In the year or two between its composition and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage was dissolved , and he experienced an " overwhelming sense of life . " The two books are as different as day and night . He no longer views the sun from the pit of despair or through the bars of estrangement . Rather than as a condemned man , he writes as a celebrant of his marriage with nature , of the " simple agreement , " as he says elsewhere , " between the earth and the foot " and of his companionship with the Mediterranean " race born in the sun and the sea , alive and spirited . " Written at a pitch of sensuousness , two of the essays , " Nuptials at Tipasa " and " The Wind at Djemila " contain the most imaginative prose that Camus was ever to write , as rich as D. H. Lawrence 's in The Sea and Sardinia . Even such statements as " the loving understanding between the earth and the man delivered from the human " are justified by the intensity of the communicated experience that embodies them . Thus he writes of the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pine and cypress , the taste of peaches ; the consummation of the skin with the sunlight and water , the " joy ? that descends from sky to sea . " Coming from the sea he throws himself down among the plants , and inhales their scent . " I am fulfilling a truth which is the sun 's and which will also be my death 's . " At Djemila the stone ruins of a Roman colony , the heavy , unbroken silence , and the desert wind , slowly evoke his sense of man 's nakedness and vanity , which annihilates the mind " so that the truth which is its very denial may be born . " In " Summer in Algiers " Camus for the first time places the terms of his dialectic in a social context . He describes his city under its aspect of carnality : a city enamoured of the body and its intense , violent and brief pleasures , where the haste to live borders on the extravagent , where " a man has played all his cards by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hedonism , Camus even views the absence of culture in Algiers as an augury of its future greatness and creativity . Here the dull brain neither perplexes nor retards : here people live without the usual hopes , myths , or consolations . In the lush Algerian landscape , ravished by the sun , he realizes that " only one thing is more tragic than suffering , and that is the life of a happy man . " In a review of Nausea , written about this time , Camus faults Sartre for failing to realize that the true source of the absurd is that which exalts life rather than impugns it . " Without beauty , love , or danger it would be almost easy to live . " The concluding essay in Noces , " The Desert , " applies the cult of the carnal to art . In Florence , he discovers that the Tuscan masters are not concerned with the flickering play of consciousness but with the essential expression of a face ; " the shape of its bones and the warmth of its blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the curse of the mind : at the price of hope . For the body knows nothing of hope , " etc . The work of art , like the unmediated life , is a stripping down to truth : the Franciscan monks of Fiesole who live among flowers and meditate over human skulls , the sun worshippers on the beaches of AlDECEMBER 21 , 1968 giers , even the incest and rapacity of the Italy of the Borgias , all testify to the same " fierce and soulless grandeur , " the same " resolve to live " that . Piero della Francesca places on the face of his risen Christ . Full living and ex- , pressing begin with beauty and lead past the far side of morality to a point of awareness at which " the heart is closed " and the mind " feeds on nothingness . " It is in this " desert , " the one that Rimbard found in Abyssinia , that the healing springs of indifference begin to flow . On this pure nihilistic note , Nuptials ends . As the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far , as Camus was to go . He had reached the limits of his essentially positive nature : the point at which the inhuman demands more of man 's creaturely existence than it can provide and the will of a Caligula begins its experiments . The essays in Summer , spanning the next 15 years , represent a retreat from these demonic paradoxes . Dionysus gives way to Prometheus , nature to culture , the inhuman to the unjust , death to ' the death camps . The prejudice against mind becomes a prejudice in its favor : the mitigable suffering of men , the plague of violence that has overtaken Europe , desperately requires it . Like Tarrou , the traveler who makes his sacrifice and stays in Oran during the plague , Camus found in the Resistanee and in his work for the newspaper Combat an allegiance to the party of humanity that ended his long estrangement and redirected his temperament as an opponent of nihilism : the vocation on which he , like Gide , based his pride in being a man . Thus the noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and " tragic optimism " of classical Greece as the center of the " Mediterranean culture " Camus brought north with him to . Paris . Finally , his literary criticism , like his prose itself , grows progressively more austere and conservative ; as though everything since Greek philosophy and drama represented to him either inspired imitations of their circumspect , measured approach to the great themes of human destiny , or else a falling away , the final collapse being the cult of personality and improvisation found in the writing of his time . The civic stance and burdened tone of the later Camus , the excessive mgsure , the clear loss of sensuousness are paralleled in his criticism . He rejects the perversities of modernism : " if the words ' justice , ' ' goodness , ' ' beauty , ' have no meaning , then the world becomes absurd and men can tear each other to pieces . " Language is not meant to express what is most personal in men but what is most strictly impersonal and closest to their common experience . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to present men in " their flesh and their duration " it will need to recall itself to this " higher banality . " Similarly , the freedom of the artist , like that of the political rebel , lies in his recognition of limits . The secret of a Stendhal or a Proust , or , for that matter , a Sade , is not originality but fidelity : an obstinate hewing to " a certain tone , a certain constancy of soul , and a human and literary knowledge of sacrifice . " We are back again with the familiar , THE NEW REPUBLIC public Camus . But we will be in much better touch with him if we keep in mind the young , solitary explorer of " the desert , " who was no stranger , after all , to the author of The Stranger , The Fall , or the stories in Exile and the Kingdom . His final rebellion , against the power of the inhuman , began with his own character , and from it he acquired his own " knowledge of sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preface to The Wrong Side : " In order to be created , a work of art must first of all make use of the dark forces of the soul . But not without channeling them , surrounding them with dikes , so that the water in them rises . Perhaps my dikes are still too high today . From this , the occasional stiffness . . . .
