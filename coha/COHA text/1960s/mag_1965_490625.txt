THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THE death of T. S. Eliot deprives the English-speaking world not of a literary master  --  he exists in his work and will Continue to exist  --  hut of a cultural presence that united two literatures and extended the venerable tradition of the presiding poet-critic into our time . He was our Dryden , our Coleridge , our Arnold , and as long as he was alive our literature seemed in some sense restrained from the apocalyptic formlessness and obscenity that it seeks . Eliot 's peculiar authority derived from his own participation in this century 's despair ; he was a great conservative containing a great radical . What was most peculiar about his authority , per- ! laps , was how generally it was acknowledged , considering the modesty , in both tone and hulk , of his production . He was like Vale  --  ry in the weight his silences gathered from the penetration of his utterances . Of the many makers of modern literature , he was the most penetrating- , and it is this gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his critical judgments , beneath their fussy diffidence , so shockingly right . He had an optional virtue for writers ) en inability to write other than the troth  --  we mean , of course , the truth as lie felt it , so that even the pallor and whimsey of the later plays are rendered supportable by a final earnestness . As a poet , he belongs not with the great verbal impresarios , like Shakespeare and Juice , but with those great who , like Donne and Wordsworth , arrive in one 's imagination somewhat hobbled by an awkward honest ) , Like Va  --  ry , Eliot won , for his precision and austerity , that intensity of respect which passes into love . Unlike Valiiry , he won it from a people , the English , who customarily reward genial copiousness . If the attnosphere of public veneration that attended his old age , in the hundreds of American classrooms where his passionate and enigmatic lines were being mechanically charted , had about it some-thing stale and falsely Eliot 's sly gray image evaded incrimination .

Metropolitan President AMUR AMORY flounHirioN , JR. , who succeeded Roland L. Redmond last fall as president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , is a rather shy , modest man of fifty-eight , with a scholarly look and a deliberate air , who was horn and , for a while , reared in Corning , - New York , where his great-grandfather Amory Houghton founded the Corning Glass Works in 1851 . The great-grandson subsequently attended St. Bernard 's School , in Manhattan ; St. Paul 's School , in New Hampshire , where he began to collect rare books ; and Harvard , where he collected more and rarer hooks , including early editions of Lewis Carroll . " I got a great love of English literature at college , " he told us the other Saturday afternoon , when he received us in the library of his house  --  once Anne Morgan 's  --  on Sutton Place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he continued , " I had the privilege of studying under George L1 - man Kittredge and John Livingston Low es  --  those great , titanic professors of the past ! My interest in collecting switched from the printed hook to the manuscript ; in an early draft you are closer to association with the author . Look . " Mr. Houghton , who was wearing tortoise-shell glasses , gray flannels , and a gray jacket , got up , reached into one of many shelves lining two walls of the big room , and handed us the original manuscript of Elizabeth Barrett Browning 's " Sonnets from the Portuguese . " " I have the manuscript of John Locke 's ' An Essay Concerning Human Understanding ' here , a lot of Pepys ' rruiriuscripts , and the Arnold Toynbee manuscripts  --  his ' A Study of Histor ? , ' and so on , " he said , pointing to a great run of volumes hound in red , " I 'm an admirer of Toynhee . I sent a man to London to sec him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two footlockers full of what he called debris . Debris , indeed ! He has agreed that all his notebooks will come to me . I have a Gutenberg Bible here . " He waved at one of the shelves . " It 's not a very scarce hook , since there are forty-five copies or more , but mine is the only one in private hands , and my Carroll collection , starting with the 1865 ' Alice ' ? there 's a scarce hook ; only twelve or thirteen copies are known to exist  --  fills a room at my farm in Maryland . " Mr. H. , we learned , has turned the greatest Keats collection in the world over to the Houghton Library , at his alma mater . " Harvard 's rare books and manuscripts outgrew the Widener Library in the late nineteen-thirties , so I gave the university a helping hand in housing them , " he said . " How about art ? " we asked , mindful of his present post . Mr. Houghton indicated a portrait of an old man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of the room , and said , " That 's the smallest Rembrandt in existence , painted in 1632 , and the dozen illuminated leaves you see on the walls arc from the greatest Eastern manuscript known  --  the ' Shah Nama , ' or ' Book of Kings , ' a Persian epic poem . I have two hundred and fifty-six of these plates , all told , but I 'm not a collector of art per sc . I just get things I like and love , and tuck them away . " He waved toward an open doorway and said that the next room contained a number of Fragonards he had tucked away . We asked for a presidential word , and he said , " I 've been on the board of the Met since 1952 , and I 've served on many of its committees , so I think I know it reasonably well from the trustees ' point of view . I 'm now trying to learn the functioning job of the president . You do n't run for office at the Met , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've sat at Roland Redmond 's feet . I 've learned a lot from him ; we 've had a great period of development under him . We have from five to six million visitors a year , an unequalled curatorial staff , and the outstanding director in Jim Rorimer . Museums are a new phenomenon in our society ; most of them started in the last hundred years . They 're tied in with the rise of democracy . They 've given the mass of people their first opportunity to see the great objects that used to he in private collections . People go to them not just for emotional impact but to learn about things . Labelling is important . We may see more extensive labelling in the Metropolitan than in the past . We may see labels in more than one language . We may have guidebooks in several languages . I think we 've come to the point where we ca n't do without museums ; they 're locked right in with our lives . If we have a society in which the museum is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe this country is going to have the greatest civilization in the world . " He refilled our glass and his , and said that he had recently come hack from East Africa . " I run Corning Glass 's Steuben Glass section , which is a small part of my family 's business , " he said . " I work fairly hard most of the year  --  I 'm at my office by nine  --  hut I take time off for two-week trips all over . My family often goes with me . This last trip was to Uganda , Kenya , Tanzania , and Zambia , where President Kaunda had invited me to see his country get its JANUARY 1 Cv 1 9 fa 5 independence . We 've been to Mount Sinai  --  an incredible monastery , loaded with the arts of early Christendom . The icons are beyond belief . There you are in the Book of Exodus , at the site of the burning husk And one summer we spent eleven days at Tellik Bay , in the Arctic , where we stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , and the pack ice had moved off . It was too warm for igloos ; we lived in tents , which were anchored with rocks against the wind . The rise in tide was fifty-five feet . I found the Eskimos absolutely fascinating . They 've learned to live and establish a culture under the most awful conditions ; you 're back in neolithic times . I 'd like to return . I 'm a strong believer in the single-purpose trip  --  do one thing in depth , rather than skip around like a stone over the surface . Here in town  --  and , most weekends , in Maryland  --  we live a reasonably quiet life that I enjoy very much . No night clubs . I 've never been bored in my life . " We rose to leave , and , accompanying us downstairs , Mr. Houghton said , " Women came into the Met as trustees under Mr. Redmond . Dorothy Shaver was an outstanding trustee , and we now have Helen Reid , Mary Whitehouse , Minnie Fosburgh , Joan Payson , and Brooke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we draw on just half the population  --  men  --  for such positions ? A lot more women in our society could he useful if they had the training and opportunity . " Misdemeanor THE Metropolitan Opera has long suffered from a lack of storage space for its scenery , and consequently the management occasionally puts certain sets and bulky props outside the building 's doors on Seventh Avenue . A friend of ours reports that he was passing that spot the other day and noticed a large coach-and-four , a prop from " Marion , " parked , horseless , by the curb . Tied to the vehicle was an illegal-parking ticket , signed , with a flourish , by one of the Fourteenth Precinct 's finest . Private A part of a continuing effort to find a censorproof outlet for their work , a number of New York 's so-called underground film-makers  --  that most embattled of contemporary avantgardes  --  have organized something called the Film-Makers ' Cinematheque . This should not he confused with the Film-Makers ' Cooperative , a distribution center that we reported on a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Inc. , and the Film Culture Non-Profit Corporation , two holding companies that hold the CoiTherative and the Cinematheque , respectively , or with the magazine Film Culture , the organ for the entire movement . But all these enterprises do have one thing in common  --  the guiding hand of Jonas Mekas , New York 's most embattled as well as most corporate avant-gardist . Having learned one recent Monday that the Cinematheque had arranged a midnight showing of half a dozen films at the New Yorker Theatre , we took a subway ride uptown that night to see what was new . Despite the late hour , the lobby was filled with a voluble , variegated crowd , in the center of which we found Mr. Mekas , as lean as ever and looking slightly less unhappy than he had looked the last time we saw him . " The Cinematheque has attracted more members than we expected , " he told us . " About five hundred and fifty  --  paid . Ve'ra operating as a strictly private film society , so we can show any films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more trouble . " The trouble that Mr. Mekas has already had started with public screenings , early in 1964 , of such controversial works as " Un Chant d'Amou ? , " by Jean Genet , and " Flaming Creatures , " by Jack Smith , a New York f - ak u r . L Nrh en these two were shown , the police seized prints of the films , dosed the theatres , and arrested the people responsible for the programs . Charges in the Genet case were eventually dropped , but Mekas and two associates were convicted of violating the city obscenity laws by trying to exhibit " Flaming Creatures ; " the ) were given suspended sentences , which are now being appealed . Jack Perlman , the Cinematheque 's lawyer , who happened to he standing next to Mr. Mekas , volunteered to clarify the legal situation for us . It seems that New York State law stipulates that all films intended for public exhibition for pay must be licensed by the motion-picture division of the State Board of Education , and New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public must he licensed by the City Department of Licenses . The city will not allow licensed theatres to show unlicensed films to the paying public , and the state board may refuse to license films it considers obscene . " That 's why we 've set the Cinematheque up as strictly private and non-profit , " Mr. Perlman said . " To see our films , you have to he a member  --  dues are three dollars a month , twenty-five dollars a year  --  and you ca n't buy memberships at the door . In fact , no money will change hands at the theatre . I wo n't even let them sell popcorn here . " He smiled . " Eventually , " Mr. Mekas said , without a smile , " we will have two theatres of our own , running simultaneously , seven nights a week . There will be a small one , for members only , where we 'll show unlicensed films , and a larger one , open to the public , where we 'll show programs of film classics , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he suggested that we talk with Robert Brown , the secretary of the Film-Makers ' Cinematheque . " He 's twenty-two years old , " added Mr. Mekas , who is forty-one . " The young people are taking charge . I 've found that you ca n't trust the older generation . " At this point , a young man shouted out above the crowd noise , " Could you all - tense sit down ? The show is about to begin ! " With what appeared to be some reluctance , the still chattering members began to file into the theatre , and we followed . Of the six films on the program , we found the best one , entitled " Dog Star Man , Part II , " indescribable , in the exact sense of that word , since it was a succession of moving images that defy literal paraphrase : a brief glimpse of a bawling baby in black-and-white , followed by an even briefer glimpse of animated purple rhomboids , followed by a moment of blank screen , followed by another glimpse of the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film creates a sort of subliminal montage in the viewer 's mind . The images may be accompanied by anything from an earsplitting roar on the sound track to the quiet hum of the projector itself . When two hours had passed , the house lights came on , and we sought out Robert Brown and arranged to meet him the next day in the Cinematheque 's headquarters , on East Fourth Street , between Second Avenue and the Bowery . Fourth Street at that point looks a little like a scale model of the " new " lower East Side . There 's a cocktail lounge on the corner , an old brown apartment house , several well-preserved loft buildings , three Off Broadway theatres , and the basement offices of the Ukrainian Daily News . The Cinernatheque is housed in a small front room and a very large back room on the second floor of a trim four-story white brick building . Seated behind a battered wooden desk in the front room , which was newly painted , was Secretary Brown , a clean-shaven , well-fed , collegiate-looking young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been about to return to Boston University last fall , as a senior , majoring in film and broadcasting , when Mekas asked him to come to New York and help run the Cinema-cheque . We asked Mr. Brown when he had first become interested in the cinema underground . " Well , actually , it was a year ago , " he said . " A paper of mine for a course in American film was already a week overdue , and I happened to be in New York for Christmas vacation , so T decided to tape an interview with a live film-maker , he-cause that was the easiest way to do the paper . I did n't have anything particular to do New Year 's Eve , so , on an off chance , I called the offices of the Film-Makers ' Cooperative , and they gave me a List of New York film-makers . I got in touch with one of them , and he arranged a showing of his films at the CoOp the next day , and then I borrowed a tape recorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a B-minus in the course . But in the spring term my marks suffered a lot , because I spent most of my time arranging screenings of Coop films in Boston and Springfield . I felt that there were a lot of people who would like the films if they got a chance to see them . Having no degree does n't bother me at all . It bothers my father but not me . " Brown said that the large back room would he ready for use as a hundredand-fifty-seat theatre , for members only , sometime in February , and that membership should reach one thousandpaid  --  in the next few months . " Of course , the city can still close us down , if they really want to , once we get our own theatre going and start showing the controversial thing-s , like ' Flaming Creatures , " Un Chant d'Amour , ' and Kenneth Anger 's ' Scorpio Rising . ' They can always find something  --  fire regulations , technicalities . " We asked him how he would feel about going to jail for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as much an aesthetic question as a moral issue . " I 'm not sure I 'd go to jail for Flaming Creatures . ' I 'm not sure it 's worth it , " he said . " But I would go to jail for ' Scorpio Miracle ANT acquaintance of ours who works in the Fifty-second Street Doubleday Book Shop tells us that through the years he has become used to gathering up belongings dropped and forgotten by browsing book buyers . However , he was somewhat taken aback when , during the Christmas shopping peak , he discovered that one customer had left a pair of crutches behind . Axles and Cones CHARLES BUTCHER , who is the executive vice-president and treasurer of the Butcher Polish Company , of Malden , Massachusetts , makers of the famous Butcher 's Wax , which we al-ways assumed was named for a butcher and not for a Butcher , is one of those simul-taneously hardheaded and ro-mantic people who like to speculate on what life will be like twenty-five or fifty years hence and who then go out and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocky , ami-able , and eloquent man in his late forties , Mr. Butcher occasionally leaves Malden long enough to journey to New York , and on a recent visit here he introduced us to a gadget that he believes is the prototype of many such gadgets , large and small , which will soon be taking some of the drudgery out of human society . Mr. Butcher , who holds that the natural end of economics should be the total elimination of labor , assured us that if mankind were willing to recognize and develop the possibilities of automation , everyone in the world would he literally sitting pretty by the turn of the century , and he gave substance to this prediction by demonstrating the capacities of a machine he has named 13 utch . At present , the machine comes in only two sizes : Little Butch , which is housed in a metal hemisphere that has the diameter of a tennis ball , and Big Butch , whose carapace has approximately the diameter of a basketball . To show us how Butch works , Mr. Butcher turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels mounted on an axle that was driven by a battery-powered motor ; the axle passed through two brass cones , whose larger ends abutted on , and were equal in diameter to , the wheels , and whose smaller ends were joined at the center of the axle . " It 's this axle-and-cone system that makes Butch a pattern-follow  --  ing device , " said Mr. Butcher . " When Butch encounters and mounts any protrusion  --  a rope , let 's say  --  it automatically follows the rope to its end . Any tendency to veer from the rope is checked by the fact that as the machine drifts to the left or to the right , the thicker end of the cone on that side rides up on the rope , and the wheel abutting it is raised off the floor . This causes the opposite wheel to drive the mechanism back toward the rope , thus forcing Butch to stay on the track . It could scarcely be simpler . " Broad as Mr. Butcher believes the prospects for the Butches of the future to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the problem of floor maintenance . " Thirty billion dollars of our gross national product goes into the cleaning and maintenance of hotels , hospitals , restaurants , schools , and office and apartment buildings , and about five per cent of our national labor force is engaged in this drudgery , " said Mr. Butcher . " Moreover , though eighty per cent of the cost of maintaining the average building goes for cleaning and polishing floors and other horizontal surfaces , the huge force that performs this task is equipped with the most inferior labor-saving devices of any single group of workers . Except for the vacuum cleaner and the rotary polishing brush , janitors today are using practically the same tools  --  brooms , mops , and buckets  --  that they were using back in 1880 , when my grandfather founded the family business . " To provide a remedy for this situation , which struck him as scandalous , Mr. Butcher turned a couple of years ago to a brainy group of designers and architects in Cambridge who call themselves Geometries Incorporated . " The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need THE NEW YORKER 29 " Alice , look ! We been reapportioned ! " ? ? was to eliminate the human factor in horizontal-surface mainte nance , " Mr. Butcher told us . " Their first idea was for a random-motion machine , which could be released in a closed room to do automatic cleaning and polishing , but it soon became obvious that such a machine would be inefficient , because it would be constantly going back over a part of the job it had already dune . Then Richard Eanmer , a twenty-eight year-old inventor at Geometries , came up with the notion of an axle-and-cone device , and , with his chief , an architect named William Wainwright , he built the first model of Butch . The beauty of Butch is the time , effort , and manpower it will save . Instead of using brooms , mops , and those rotary brushes , - which have a tendency to go bucking off in all directions , a janitor will simply lay a cord down the center of a room or corridor  --  perhaps the same cord that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a switch ; off Butch will go , towing behind it an oscillating floor-maintenance machine that can scrub , wax , and buff in a single pass . Butch is not yet in production , but once we get it well launched in maintenance , we 'll start exploring other possible uses for it  --  the mowing of lawns and golf courses , the cleaning up of airstrips and big parking lots , the plowing and harrowing and sowing of fields , the harvesting of crops , and heaven knows what else . In the meantime , using my contacts at Geometries Incorporated as a nucleus , I 've organized some of my scientific and scholarly friends into an outfit called the Butcher Polish Company Advisory Group , and invited them to use their brains for dreaming up solutions to any and all problems that seem worth thinking about . At present , I 'm forming a special subsidiary company to sell Butch and all the future creations of the Advisory Group . The new company will be called the Lazy Eight , which is what scientists call the symbol for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of describing our free-floating philosophy and our firm belief in the policy of selling tomorrow . I believe that man 's ability to understand man has so increased in my lifetime that if we can only free him from the slavery of labor , he will rise to new and unimagined heights of creative effort in the fields of science , medicine , and exploration . Butch and similar devices are a means of winning that freedom . " Words and Music ONE of our oldest acquaintances , a sandwich-maker in a West Side delicatessen who remembers the myriad orders shouted at him by converting them into song lyrics , has been beset by new troubles . The entire price list of his restaurant 's menu was raised last week , and the customers are complaining . Now the song our friend most often sings goes like this : Do n't everybody have a distress Just because you got to pay a lousy nickel more For a beautiful thick **27;2857;TOOLONG , Which you could n't get for twice the price In any other place in town , Including the fancy spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to pay ninety-five cents When once upon a time it was only ninety .
