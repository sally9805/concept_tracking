Anyone who reads the morning papers has probably seen shocking advertisements about cruelty to laboratory animals . One ad shows hundreds of rabbits with their necks clamped into wooden stocks . Another warns of terrible experiments in which animals are burned , cut , and flayed . But , say the ads , there is a way to bring these cruelties to an end . The remedy is a bill before Congress , which will curb the inhumanity of science . If we will only write to our Congressmen , the humane societies promise that thousands of animals will be spared unnecessary pain . What are the facts about these so-called animal-care bills ? Are the humane societies ' claims really true ? Or is it true , as the scientists maintain , that the real purpose of the bills is not to improve care but to put limits on experimentation ? As I looked into these questions I made some disturbing discoveries . I found that some laboratory animals do not get adequate care . I also found that humane organizations are not always mindful of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddled with defects . They will do very little for animal welfare but they could seriously cripple scientific research . Pet lovers encompass a broad spectrum of feeling . Some sensitive ladies refuse to eat meat . Others eat meat but wo n't buy alligator bags . Still others campaign against hunting . Vivisection is only one of many cruelties that they oppose . In recent months , however , it has become an obsession with animal lovers all over the country . The popularity of the animal-care bills with so many pet lovers is itself a peculiar fact . Why areso many people preoccupied with the alleged cruelty of research ? Why do they praise Dr. Jonas Salk in one breath and condemn experimentation in another ? There is no simple answer to this question . One doctor suggested to me that this , like other outbreaks of antiscientific feeling , is simply an expression of nostalgia ? a wish for the good old days when life was uncompfl:ated by things like LSD and the hydrogen bomb . Psychiatrists , unquestionably , have their own explanations . Whatever the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger today than at any other time in this century . This revival of antivivisection sentiment , and the agitation to control experimentation is due largely to an organization called till , Animal Welfare Institute , and to its director , Mrs. Roger L. Stevens . Mrs. Stevens is not the dumpy old lady in tweeds that one pictures ad a professional animal lover. * Instead , she is a member of New York social circles ; an elegant and superbly dressed woman ( as her pictures in Logue attest ) . She is married to Roger Stevens , a Democratic party bigwig and Special Assistant to the President on the Arts , as well as Chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts . She is intelligent ; she has pull ; and , though she is not an antivivisectionist , she has very firm convictions about the need for humane legislation . In her opinion science is unnecessarily cruel , and the way to eliminate this barbarism is to put the federal government in control of animal research . *See " That Mrs. Stevens , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harper 's , July 1162 ) . 102 SCIENTISTS VS . ANIMAL LOVERS In 1960 Mrs. Stevens drafted a bill and had it introduced in Congress by Senator John Sherman Cooper . ( A similar bill was introduced in the 88th Congress by Representative James C. Cleveland and Senator Joseph S. Clark . ) The purpose of both bills is " To provide humane treatment for animals used in experiments and tests . " Under their provisions , every research scientist must procure a license from the Secretary of Health , Education , and Welfare . Before he performs any specific experiment , the scientist must file a project plan with the Secretary and receive permission to proceed . In addition , he must file an annual report specifying the number of animals he used , procedures employed , and a copy of his research proposals . The Secretary is empowered to turn down research proposals , to revoke a scientist 's license , and to stop his research altogether by terminating his government grants . This proposal created a sensation . Animal lovers all over the country began to clamor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put off taking a stand , the National Catholic Society for Animal Welfare began fighting for a bill right away . The Humane Society of the United States ( HSUS ) joined battle too , with gratifying results as far as its membership rolls were concerned . The Society now claims close to a million members and its president , Oliver Evans , attributes its growth to the antiresearch campaign . " The ' Movement ' was dying out , " he says , " until we finally discovered that this was the angle to take . " Evans himself is a newcomer to the Movement , and in some ways he seems out of place . He has a sense of humor , for one thing , and he does not take moral stands . In fact he readily admitted to me that hunting causes much more pain than science : but the Society does not campaign against hunting because , as he put it , " If we tried to stamp out hunting they 'd just stamp us out instead . " He has a pragmatic approach to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill ran into trouble because of certain overstrict provisions , he drafted an alternate piece of legislation . Evans believed that his bill would pass Congress this year . It did not , for a variety of reasons . One was dissension in the Movement ( the National Catholic Society wanted something stronger ; the ASPCA thought the bill too strict ) . Another reason was the dognapping issue , which suddenly came to a head . The HSUS diverted its efforts to controlling animal dealers and outlawing the stealing of pets. * The bill to control vivisection has been put off for yet another year . There is no question , however , that the fight will continue , and when the Ninetieth Congress convenes , more stringent bills are sure to be reintroduced . Pain with a Purpose Is there a need for such legislation ? Is science really inhumane ? I could not stifle the feeling that most animal lovers start off with affirmative answers and then go out to gather their facts . In any case , a great many people are devoting their time to exposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Stevens , others for the HSUS and some for small organizations or on their own . They tour laboratories all over the country . They interview students who are disillusioned with research . If deception is necessary , they sneak into buildings after dark or take jobs as animal handlers. ** In this way they have gathered a good deal of evidence and built up a case against research . An example of what they find is this quotation from Mrs. Stevens . Testifying before Congress in 1962 , she described the conditions in a " well-known " New York City hospital ( otherwise unnamed ) : " The dogs , " she said , " were kept in small , dirty mesh-bottom cages with no bedding . They were in a dark , dirty , smelly little room that was so infested that the animals , the floor , and the walls were alive and crawling with vermin . These vermin were breeding in a heap of excrement ; they were so thick on the fluor that they were crawling over my feet . " Later at that hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were kept in wire-mesh cages with heavy " In August , President Johnson signed this bill ( HR 13881 ) which also sets standards for animal care . It does not , however , provide for federal regulation of actual experimentation on animals . ' For example , in 1959 , HSUS brought a complaint against Linda Loma University ( formerly the College of Medical Evangelists ) in California . The case was based on evidence gathered by Thomas 0 . Hammond , an investigator for HSUS , who took a job as an animal caretaker at the college . When the State Department of Health looked into the case , it found that the facts did not warrant disciplinary action . HUTS challenged the Board in the courts , but both the lower court and the appeal court upheld the Board of Health . 104 SCIENTISTS VS . ANIMAL LOVERS chains dangling from their necks . He too saw evidence of filth but even worse , he said , were the technicians who cleaned cages with hoses , turning hot and cold water on animals too sick to rise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate reform . But dirty cages and vermin have nothing to do with vivisection as such . Since the humane societies believe that experimentation itself should be restricted , they also have to prove to Congress that scientists are unnecessarily cruel . This they have tried to do by reading through professional journals and clipping reports of experiments that sound as if they caused pain . The societies cite these experiments in their publications and at Congressional hearings . It is very doubtful to my mind , however , whether any one of the hundreds they have quoted is really an example of " unnecessary " or " avoidable " pain . What , for instance , are we to make of testimony from the late Fred Myers , the past president of HSUS ? At the 1962 hearing Mr. Myers described an experiment at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research which , he whispered with horror , " was deliberately designed to cause pain . " The experiment consisted of implanting wire electrodes in the head of a monkey and then passing currents through its brain . The pain was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed and grimaced and tried vainly to escape . He implies , of course , that this is " unnecessary " pain . But what he does not say is that the recent discovery that there are " pain " and " pleasure " centers in the brain is a milestone in neurological research . ( Nor does he say that there is no other way to locate the pain center than by the procedure described . ) The experiment may have sounded unnecessarily cruel , but someday neurosurgeuns will utilize that knowledge to treat thousands of people who suffer from intractable pain . There are two other types of experiments which the animal lovers quote as examples of " unnecessary " pain . One is research on burns , and the other is stress . " Stress , " in the technical sense , is an important clinical syndrome ; shock ( which is related to stress ) causes thousands of deaths every year among burn victims , women in childbirth , and patients who have had " successful " operations but die in the recovery room . Burns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately for better ways to treat burns ; for ways to prevent infection and to halt the onset of shock . Why then do the advocates of an animal-care law continually emphasize the fact that animals are " scalded " and " burned " ? Do they want to stop research in this field altogether ? Or are they simply resorting to demagoguery and , by appealing to our emotions , helping to complicate an issue which is already sufficiently complex ? My own feeling is that the testimony that emphasizes " burning " and " scalding " is simply and deliberately misleading . This research will continue whether or not the animal-care law is passed . Advocates of the bills claim they will not stop vital research . But what they will surely do ( as a similar law now does in Britain ) is to smother research 106 SCIENTISTS VS . ANIMAL LOVERS in a mass of bureaucratic red tape . The dispenser of this red tape , called the Coordinator of Animal Welfare , will sit in his office in Washington and pass on proposals for research . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He may suggest to the experimenter that he use fewer animals , or a different species from the one that he wants . The coordinator could bring research to a halt . What is far more likely , however , is that he will prevent one or two scientists from being cruel and , in the process , seriously hamper all the rest . Every scientific society in the country has gone on record against such a law , including the American Heart Association , the College of Physicians , and the College of Surgeons . Animal lovers assume that any scientist who opposes their bills enjoys being cruel . But there are good reasons for the scientists determined stand . By way of an example , one scientist told me this story . Two years ago , he said , the Humane Society of the U. S. published an article in its Newsletter about the laboratories at New York University Medical Center . To illustrate how bad conditions were , they included a picture , albeit a fuzzy one , of a Dalmatian-type dog lying prostrate on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog had had severe abdominal surgery and had been lying for eighteen hours without postoperative care . In fact , said my informant ( who was in charge of the NYU laboratories at the time ) , the dog was easy to identify because of its markings . It turned out that this particular dog had had two small stainless-steel valves implanted in its chest twelve months before the picture was taken . On the day of the humane inspector 's visit , the dog had been X-rayed and doctors had sedated it to make sure it would lie still on the machine . It had not been operated on that day ; it had never had abdominal surgery , and it did not lie for eighteen hours before an attendant checked it . The dishonesty of some humane groups has disgusted many scientists and led them to oppose their political positions . The animal lovers are also given to making accusations without naming the laboratory in question or the journal in which an experiment was reported . When the facts are finally tracked down , it often turns out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. , that the animal was anesthetized ) has been completely overlooked . So many scientists have found this to be true that they no longer listen to anything the humane societies say . Scientists also object to specific provisions of the animal-care laws , particularly the requirement that proposals be submitted to Washington . As one scientist put it , " All the best things I 've everdone were done just on a hunch and usually in the middle of the night . " The bills are supposed to prevent duplication of work . It is well known to scientists , however , that many important discoveries were made when one skeptical scientist decided to try to duplicate another man 's work . Finally , scientists object to the idea that a " coordinator " inside the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare is supposed to redesign experiments and limit the number of animals used . This measure alone could cripple research , as one scientist testified to Congress . " It is a fantasy , " he said , to suppose that a Washington coordinator could appropriately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tens of thousands of scientists try to discover new knowledge , and this bill would make the intellectual competence of these thousands futile by imposing the judgment of a coordinator upon them . " Who Is " Qualified " ? The scientific societies are determined to fight these restrictions and so are scientists in government research institutions ( " Over my dead body , " an official at the National Institutes of Health told me ) . This does not mean , however , that doctors and scientists do n't worry about laboratory animals . Many of them are revolted by reports of substandard conditions and would like to see animal care improved . " Why do n't they provide better care then ? " an animal lover might ask . The answer is that the scientists who carry out research often have nothing to do with animal care . In fact , many of them have never seen the inside of an animal room . When a scientist needs two cats or fifty rats for an experiment , he calls up the animal " facility " in his hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is finished , the animals go back where they came from . Then who is responsible for animal care ? This varies from one place to another . In some hospitals and universities there is a central animal facility and it is run by a professional veterinarian . In others , there is an administrator in charge of animals who has no medical training at all . In still others there is a separate animal room for each department ( e.g. , medicine , biochemistry , microbiology ) . Often , responsibility for animal care is badly defined . Fortunately , however , the trend in new research centers is to build a centralized facility and , if money is available , to hire a professional veterinarian to run it . This is a laudable idea , assuming that there are veterinarians available and that they are qualified to take charge of a lab . But both these assumptions are false . The fact is that there are too few veterinarians in the country and even they do not know how to treat monkeys and mice . They do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimpanzee of diarrhea . The administration of an animal laboratory raises manifold problems that do not appear in textbooks or in any veterinary course . Lack of training for laboratory directors is one reason why animal care is not better . Another is lack of training for animal technicians . The Animal Care Panel , which is a society of veterinarians , laboratory directors , and commercial breeders , has tried to tackle this problem by providing courses in animal handling . ( One humane group , the ASPCA in New York City , also sponsors such a course ; so does the Ralston Purina Company . ) But these courses are expensive to run and they do n't reach nearly enough people . The majority of laboratory-animal technicians are still totally untrained . They may not even like animals . " They just come in off the street , " as one professor at Princeton University put it . When this is the case , it is hardly surprising that animals do not get proper care . There is a third reason why animal care is inadequate , why cages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly , is lack of money . The animal lovers maintain that research grants are generous enough . But what they do not understand is that there are administrative restrictions on these grants so they ca n't be used for improving animal facilities . Some institutions get unrestricted grants , but these do n't get used for animals either . As one administrator told me , " It is a rare president or dean who will use money for animal facilities when he could hire a Nobel Prize winner or build a flashy new lab " with the funds . Agouti on the East River It is ironic that money is the key problem ; that the Anti-Vivisection League spends half a million dollars every year while hospitals do n't build better kennels because they ca n't raise private funds to match government grants . But this does not justify the implication in so many humane publications that when animal care is inadequate , the reason is deliberate neglect . Running a laboratory is a difficult job that requires specialized knowledge , a competent staff , and adequate funds . Given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 109 animal care can be good . 1 saw this on a tour of the animal rooms at New York University Medical Center . I chose NYU for my visit because the animals there are housed in a single central unit ( called the Berg Institute ) , and because Dr. L. It . Christensen , the director , is an expert on animal care . The Institute rises six stories above the East River , and as we waited for the elevator Dr. Christensen sketched in some facts . He said that more than 90 per cent of the animals used at NYU are kept in the Institute . The rest include a few monkeys who live out on Long Island , some mice that are being inbred to produce a pure genetic strain , and some other small rodents that are infected with human pathogens and therefore kept in isolation . How many animals are in the Institute now ? About 5,000 mice , 1,250 rats , 1,100 guinea pigs , 700 rabbits , 130 dogs , 45 cats , and a few other assorted mammals . Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is just about average : smaller than some , larger than others . When we looked at the animals themselves , I was amazed . I had expected to see overcrowding and at least some dogs and cats who were mangy and underfed . ( Since hospitals buy unclaimed dogs from city pounds , one would expect to find animals who still showed the effects of wandering homeless through the streets . ) But in the first room we visited I saw forty-five healthy-looking dogs , which barked lustily when I came in , thumped their tails against the sides of their cages and happily licked at my hand . In the postoperative room there were eight or nine animals , some lying quietly in their cages , others up and walking around . I saw no open wounds , and no signs of distress ? in fact , no signs at all that experiments had been done except for cards on each of the cages that noted what had taken place . ( On each of these cards there is also a number that corresponds to a card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office keeps individual records for every animal including the date of its arrival , the place from which it came , and the investigator who is using it . After leaving the dog rooms , we saw rabbits ( regular and lop-eared ) , woodchucks , squirrels , monkeys , guinea pigs , rats , and mice . We also saw creatures called Agouti that look like the offspring of an unfortunate cross between a tapir and a miniature poodle . I realized then the difficulties that a laboratory director faces with large numbers of animals , limited space , and new species he has never seen before . The laboratory director must be architect , veterinarian , and research director rolled into one ; it is a difficult job . 110 SCIENTISTS VS . ANIMAL LOVERS When the tour was over , I asked Dr. Christensen about conditions in the other laboratories he has seen , How do they compare to NYU ? His answer was that some laboratories provide excellent care but others , unfortunately , do not . There are too many laboratories , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are even some places with shiny equipment and new country kennels where the animals are still in poor condition . But , he added , he has never seen conditions as horrible as those the humane inspectors describe . Nor , he said , is there anything in this country as bad as the breeding farms he saw in England , or laboratories elsewhere in Europe . Dr. Christensen attended an international conference this spring on laboratory-animal care , and in his opinion we are much further along in this field than most of the countries in Europe . A Matter of Money The laboratories at New York University convinced me of the need for " new " or " additional " legislation to help improve animal care . If more hospitals could afford such facilities , if there were more courses for animal technicians and more directors with Dr. Christensen 's training , then care would be immeasurably improved . If Congress would provide money for physical improvements and grants to the veterinary schools , then care would improve . Without money from federal grants , there will still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do not believe , however , that there is a need for restrictions on research . I am not persuaded that scientists are needlessly cruel . And I think it is not feasible to license every scientist in this country and make him write for permission before he starts a new piece of work . ( There is such a law in Britain , but ours is a much larger country and our research is on a much larger scale . ) Finally , I do not agree with the basic assumption that legislation can make a scientist humane . Could a government committee really have this effect. ? Surely what a scientist does in his laboratory is determined partly by his technical competence and partly by his reverence for life . If a scientist is careless or inhumane , his colleagues can restrain him far more effectively than can an inspector in Washington who reads over the proposals he submits . It is comforting to think that a single piece of legislation could save innocent animals from pain . But the antivivisectionists live in an imaginary world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all , but they refuse to face the consequence that animals have to suffer pain , Modern medicine would not be possible without animal research , and without inflicting some pain on the animals involved . I do not like the idea of painful experiments ? on a monkey or even a mouse . But I am not willing to restrict vivisection and give up the benefits that come from medical research .
