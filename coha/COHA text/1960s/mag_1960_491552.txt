impulse , I am unalterably opposed to keeping a gun in the house . I 've never had a gun in mine , even for protection . An immense mountain of grief would be avoided if everyone did the same . Another intense conviction I have about criminal trials and cases is that the preparation of the law and the facts is so vital that a man should n't try to be a lawyer at all unless he is willing to give those two things everything he 's got . As 1 have said , this includes knowing the other fellow 's case as well as you know your own . It should be possible for a defense lawyer to study the prosecution 's case so thoroughly that he can conduct a better case for the prosecution than the D. A. I usually ask one of the younger men associated with me in my office to take the prosecution 's side . I tell him , " You 're the prosecution . What would you do ? " He can have fun pretending to take the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal case is always the easier . For one thing , the prosecution always has more evidence . If you are a defense lawyer , your client would n't be in court at all if the prosecution did n't have something up its sleeve , such as a dead body , the gun used by the killer , telltale fingerprints , expert medical testimony  --  something . On the side of the prosecution is also the feeling of witnesses who otherwise might be neutral that any decent , law-abiding citizen should line up on the side of law and order , which , of course , means the police and the D. A. While I 'm on the subject of witnesses , I might add that they should be visited again and again . They may have held back something the first time they were questioned that can ruin you during the trial . Sometimes their stories change between interviews , or a witness who has tried to tell you the truth has unintentionally left out something important . It 's my policy never to call any witnesses to the stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing me . I want to know exactly what that witness is going to say when he takes the stand . I go one step further . Through investigation I try to know all there is to know about the prosecution 's witnesses too , I 'd rather be overprepared with a lot of material which I may never need than to be caught with a slip showing in my preparation . In one case I made voluminous photographic copies of my research into the backgrounds of the litigants , although I was n't sure I 'd need them . Then , in the middle of the trial , a certain matter arose . I ca n't recall what it was  --  it 's not important . The important thing is that I could reach into my briefcase and find a photocopy bearing upon precisely the point being discussed . Ihave a theory which has proved out for me : Juries will not convict on a molestation or a sex charge if the veracity of the woman complainant can be impeached . I try to find out from her neighbors if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known for her sexual carelessness . You will never lose a case if you can produce a witness who , in answer to your questions , " What is Miss So-and-so 's reputation for truthfulness where she lives ? Is it good or bad ? " replies , " It 's terrible . " When I 'm on an especially long case , 1 ask the court to order a daily transcript for me . My secretary , Mrs. Helen Fitzpatrick , digests those transcripts . She picks out the lean , meaty material , separates it from the fat and types it . Before she is through she may reduce 100 pages to six or seven typed pages . As a part of her digesting she also types out the page number and the line number in the transcript where she found that particular morsel . This seems a most sensible process ; yet , as far as I know , I 'm the only lawyer who does it . Perhaps most attorneys do n't do it because it adds so much to the expense of trying a case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid substantial fees and , by averaging my expenses , I can do a thorough job even on cases for which I am skimpily paid . In addition I study the transcript myself and make notes in longhand on small slips of yellow paper , then I shove those slips between the pages of the transcript so I can find any point in it quickly if I need to . I am more likely to use those notes in my argument than in my cross-examination , but they are useful at any time to a lawyer , who otherwise has to remember thousands of pages of testimony . Speaking of fees , I have made up my mind not to mention figures in any discussion of the sums I have received , but I will say this : Although the public takes it for granted that I have received fabulous retainers for some of my most famous cases , the fees I actually received were pittances compared with the sums people imagined I got . It would come as a stunning surprise to those who read this if I revealed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on paying me what they promised . If you arc a defense lawyer , my advice is to be sure to collect your fee while the tears are still falling and your client is fearful of the jailhouse . When the client of the criminal lawyer in the best-selling book , Anatomy of u Murder , by Robert Traver , ran out without paying his attorney , it was no fictional device to me . I 've been there too . 71 A young criminal lawyer should face the fact that his clients will promise him the world until he gets them off , but once they are acquitted , they often forget him . Some of them even turn against him , deciding that if it had n't been for him they somehow would have got into less trouble . I have known a few exceptions to this rule . I once knew a song writer whose boy was in trouble , and he employed me to represent his son . He not only paid me what I asked , but when I got his boy off , he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of my legal convictions , I might add that I once took part in a debate before the Lawyers ' Club of Los Angeles against the veteran attorney , Frank Doherty . Our subject was , " Are there too many women on our juries ? " My opponent delivered himself bravely of the following sentiments : " Our juries are from two-thirds to three-fourths women . I say to you that such predominance weakens the jury system because women , for all their fine qualities , do not have the breadth of experience men have . Women 's lives are too sheltered . " Mr. Doherty also declared , " Women are too partisan . If they 're for you , they 're for you . If they 're against you , they 're against you . A jury must be flexible enough to change its mind if the evidence warrants it . You do n't get a flexible jury if it has eight or ten women on it . " I did n't agree with attorney Doherty . " There ca n't be too many women on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've tried most of my cases before juries with feminine majorities . I like it that way . For one thing women are more attentive than men . For another they are tougher minded than men . They not only bring womanly intuition into play but they also base their findings on the facts . I have only one minor criticism of women as jurors : They have a tendency to be rougher than male jurors on women defendants . If my woman defendant also happens to be pretty , give me an all-male panel . " The admission of women to jury duty has had an uplifting effect on courtroom behavior . In the days when the juries were 100 per cent male , many of them chewed tobacco . Spittoons sat in front of the jury box . Not only the jury used them , but lawyers and judges did too . The D.A . and the defense attorney vied with each other to see how far they could stand from the spittoon and still hit it . Any D.A . who could score a fifteen-foot bull's-eye impressed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a defense attorney from walking around the D.A . ' s chair and having a shot himself . If he could score a bull's-eye , they were even again . The result was trial by expectoration . Any thoughtful or serious person who gives it a moment 's thought will conclude , as 1 do , that an explosion of publicity about a case or a client is usually extremely undesirable rather than something to be encouraged by a defense lawyer . A defense lawyer would have to be an egomaniac to hope for such a thing . His client 's best interests are almost always better served by having the public forget the sensational and prejudicial headlines the press has been stuffing down its gullet . If a defendant of mine has been made to look like a glorified harlot or art oversexed glamour boy by the reporters , it takes time to project a fairer and more accurate picture . Another firm policy of mine is this : If I do n't feel that a man who has asked me to defend him is telling me the truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level with me , I want no part of you or your case . " Then I remind him of the things which can happen to him if he does n't . I point out that if he lies , he may be accused of perjury . I warn him that if he does n't tell me the truth about the weaknesses of his case , so I can shore them up , he is leaving open avenues of attack through which the prosecution can bulldoze holes big enough to drive a team of horses . Most of the cases I accept are so serious that I ca n't afford to let the defendant fool me . A lawyer who goes into court half-cocked is likely to come out wholly cooked . But once I am convinced that a client is leveling with me , I believe in him automatically thereafter . If I do n't , I ca n't make the moves I need to make . My nomination for the loneliest feeling a man can have is his sensation while he waits for a jury to decide his fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am in the courtroom or in the hallway just outside the courtroom . I never leave my defendant facing his fate on his own . I feel that he is entitled to my moral and psychological support . Moreover , I never know at what minute the jury will come in and ask the judge for further instructions . A defense lawyer should be there to listen to what the judge says and sec if he can detect any error in it . In a Federal court the jury sometimes stays out until two or three o'clock in the morning . If it does , I stay up that late too . I 'm there with my client . I feel that I am on trial with him , so it seems natural for me to sweat it out at his side . I also have a few convictions about civil trials and cases . There 's my old friend , The Lawsuit Cow . I have a clipping of a cartoon drawn by Winsor McCay . I cut it from a newspaper in 1923 . I show it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greedy and grasping . It features an animal labeled THE LAWSUIT . McCay depitted one person pulling at the cow 's head , another at her tail . Between them a lawyer is busy milking her . The milk foaming into the bucket beneath her udder represents money . The only mistake McCay made was in not showing another lawyer on the other side of the cow milking her too . I have found it useful to show this cartoon to people who are hard-nosed about settling a case . With it I sometimes convince them that it is foolish and wasteful to take a long time to settle a lawsuit . The best illustration of this I 've ever heard was a lawsuit , tried in the South , about a borrowed buggy whip . When the whip was returned , the lender found that seven inches had been worn from the lash . High words ensued . They led to a quarrel . That quarrel was carried into court , and from that court into another court . With accompanying delays , matters dragged on until the cost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each inch of worn lash . This may be as good a time as any to disabuse the public mind of a misconception which is deeply imbedded in it The idea is that no one can ever be successfully prosecuted for murder unless a corpus delicti  --  which most people think means a dead body  --  is produced . The public takes it for granted that the word " corpus " means a corpse . That is nonsense . It does n't mean a dead body at all . A literal translation of the word " corpus " does not mean a corpse , it means a body ; and delicti means an offense . " Corpus delicti " therefore means " the body of the crime . " There can be a corpus delicti in a civil case too . A personal-injury suit would contain one . There is a public delusion that if a murdered body is never discovered the killer is automatically free of all danger of conviction , but I know of at least three cases in California in which circumstantial evidence was so strong that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any dead body . In one case a man was sentenced to death for the murder of his wile , although no trace of her has ever been found , because of evidence that the accused showed up with her forged signature and rummaged through her safe-deposit box after she was last seen alive . I once defended a client accused of murder in a preliminary hearing and was able to disprove a corpus delicti in such a way that the D.A . was defeated . The accused man 's wife was found gasping her life out in their cleaning establishment , after having swallowed a caustic fluid . The husband and wife lived in the rear of the cleaning place and , other than the dead woman herself , he was the only one who could have had access to the fluid she drank . On the theory that he had placed the fatal fluid in a cup so she would think it water , he was charged with murder . The fluid ate away part of the lining of her throat and damaged her digestive tract . The husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital , but she died before she arrived . 1 sat with him at the preliminary hearing and , to me , it was clear that her death was a suicide . I still do n't know why the D.A . thought it murder . An only son testified that his parents had had trouble getting along together , and he had heard his mother threaten to kill herself many times . Specifically he had heard her say that she was going to drink poison . There was evidence that the husband was asleep at the time his wife gulped the lethal dose and also that his wife had what was charitably known as a " mental problem . ' I won that case at the preliminary h without even going to trial because th prosecutor was unable to establish corpus delicti . I won a case for Barry Fitzgerald on the same grounds . His case , which should never have been brought up , involved the charge of " killing with automobile . " The accident occurred on Hollywood Boulevard , near the Gotham Hotel . He was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started across the street . They were wearing dark clothes . He saw neither of them , and the right front part of his car struck them . One was injured . The other was killed . Fitzgerald was not going fast . He had not been drinking . He stopped , rendered what aid he could , then summoned medical help and the police . Nevertheless , the D.A . held a preliminary hearing , and the judge held Fitzgerald for trial . I earned that issue to the Superior Court under Section 995 of the Penal Code which pro ? vides for a motion attacking the corpal charge against Fitzgerald was quashed . delieti . My motion was granted , and For there to have been a corpus deal in Fitzgerald 's case it was necessary It show not only that the victim was Wei by manslaughter but also that the de fendant was guilty of negligence , and tha negligence was a proximate cause it death . The death of a person is not corpus delieti in itself . Let us assume for a moment that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are arrested for issuing a check without enough funds on deposit to mike it good . The check is there , the lack of funds is established , but a third clement must be established ; if there is no knowledge on your part that your account was overdrawn , there 's no " body of the crime . " Or suppose somebody takes John Jones ' auto from a parking lot where Jones has left it . The police lind a man in North Hollywood driving Jones ' car . Is it a stolen car ? if Jones gave his consent to the man 's driving his car or even if there is reasonable doubt whether Jones did or did n't consent , there is no corpus delicti . On thinking back , there is one subject I have n't touched . It 's my ideas on selecting a jury . In a criminal case in California the defense is allowed ten peremptory challenges without cause ; in a murder case , twenty . All the defense attorney has to say is , " Excuse juror so-and-so , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important matter of deciding whom to challenge and whom not to challenge , I usually wander over and sit down in a chair beside the jury panel . As I question each prospective juror , I try to learn something about his occupation and background . Generally speaking , it is my feeling that people who are in sales work or the entertainment field or who are successful in business ; or who arc nice-looking and , therefore , have had a better chance of having life smile on them than others ; or who not only are married but also are apparently happily married , are apt to make good jurors from the defense point of view . On theother hand , I am inclined to challenge people who are grouchy , who are in a profession which demands meticulous care and finicky attention to detail , such as handling figures ; or science professors , or those who have encountered hard luck or bitterness in their lives . In a criminal case I am shy of military men who have been in a position of command . l 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to broad lives . An unmarried woman , for instance , may riot be a good juror for the defense in a sex case . If a case involves child-molesting , I 've always taken the position  --  and I 've been proved right  --  that from the defense 's point of view , a schoolteacher is a good juror . Schoolteachers know that their pupils often lie . When questioning a panel of jurors , it is important not to offend a juror . In one case 1 was about to try . I brought out that one of the women on the panel had a husband who worked in the city 's sanitation department . 1 felt that there was no need to pursue that line of questioning further , but when the prosecution took over , the D.A . insisted that the woman state exactly what kind of work her husband did in the sanitation department . She backed and filled , and said , " He handles the general duties of that department . " The prosecution persisted with , " Well , what does he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " No . " Growing irritable then , the D.A . asked , " Why ca n't you tell us what your husband does ? " Cornered at last , she said  --  and with a noticeable dislike for the D.A . in her voice ? " He is a garbage man . " As huhbleheaded as that D.A . was , he could now see that he had an offended woman on his hands , a woman whose pride was hurt , so he challenged her . But there was a further danger : How many women on that jury were her friends ? 1-low many had come to know her and like her while serving on the panel ? There was no way he could find out . I never even ask a woman , " Do you have a husband ? " or even , " What does your husband do ? " Instead I say , " Is there a Mr. Jones ? " If she is a widow she will say , " I am a widow . " If she does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pass on to something else . If she 's a divorcee , putting my question , " Is there a Mr. Jones ? " gives her a chance to say whatever will make her happiest . It is my conviction that the selection of a jury is a very important part of a case . It 's the one time before I get around to73 presenting my argument that I really have a chance to talk with and get to know the people who are there to decide my client 's fate . Then , when I make my final argument , I say , " When we talked together at the beginning of this trial , you told me that you 'd play the game fairly and listen to the whole case until it was finally submitted to you . " When I say that , they nod their agreement . In that very simple way I tic my original talk with them to my final argument . It is like saying to a friend , " Remember when we first met ? " From a human and psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to do . In this story 1 have been thinking of Jerry Giesler , lawyer for the defense , rather than Jerry Giesler , husband and father . If the public wants anything of me , I 'm sure it 's the lawyer they want . Still , I 'd like to talk about that other Giesler a little , even if sketchily . I am married to the former Ruth Stevens of Chicago , who was  --  and to my mind still is  --  one of the most beautiful women I 've ever known . I have had two marriages . The first one ended in divorce in 1928 . By that first marriage , which took place in 1918 , when I was thirty-two , I had a daughter , who is now living on the West Coast . I married my present wife in 1931 . She dropped in to ask me for some legal advice . I took her out to lunch and dinner . She could have got a job in pictures , but we drifted together , and that was that . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jerry Lee . Michael served a three-year hitch with the marines . He 's in my office now doing investigative work . 74 When the present airs . Giesler and l were married , we had very little The depression was in full swing , and had financial obligations arising out of my divorce . I 'll never forget one night m hen 1 took my wife out to dinner and we had only enough money for one order of fish . Fortunately , hard rolls were served free , and the bus boy served two pats of butter . I ordered one order of lino of sole , and I hat , with the rolls and butler , was our dinner . But we 've had a lot of fun together . e 've never had dull times  --  at least I have n't . We are opposite types . I 'm quiet and reserved . She loses gaiety . But at Ones our marriage has been trying to Mrs. Giesler , who occasionally remarks that I not only am married to her but also to my work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that resentfully . She mentions it as an established fact , and she puts up with things other wives wouldn't. such as not having vacations . She gives my morale a tremendous lift by sitting up with me until I go to bed , no matter w hat time it is . I may work on a case until two o'clock or four o'clock in the morning  --  sometimes es en five . Often have had as little as two hours ' sleep during the night , but she 's always there to see if there 's anything she can do for my comfort or to give me a fight talk if I need one . One night while I was preparing for the third Busby Berkeley trial , I thought , " It 's too hard . I ca n't do it . " Without realizing it , I said those things out loud as 1 paced the floor . " What ca n't you do ? " my wife asked me . " You can do anything if you put your mind to it . You 've won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it gave me the courage 1 needed . When the Alexander Pantages case was over , we moved a little closer to easy street . After the Pantages trial , I got more important cases , and we moved from our flat to a beautiful apartment at Sycamore and Beverly . Mrs. Giesler did the decorating , and it was exquisite . From there we moved to a house with eighteen rooms , on Ridgedale . There we put in our first swimming pool . That house , however , was too big . By that time we had two children , but even four of us rattled around . Our answer was to buy the one we live in now , which is more manageable . Mrs. Giesler decorated my law She has a knack for doing such things . My office has a quiet muted atmosphere , enhanced by dark green walls and pinpoint spotlights concealed in the ceiling . She had a small photograph of Mr , Darrow and a small photograph of Mr. Rogers both enlarged and matted and framed to harmonize with each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that I appear between their two likenesses . If you talk to her , she 'll tell you that I have certain pluses and minuses , One plus is that I have infinite patience . " But when it conies to business matters , not so good , " she 'll soy . " I 'm his business manager . He needs one . " She thinks that I am a soft touch , an easy mark . She tells a story to prove she 's right . One night the front doorbell rang . Mrs. Giesler and I were propped up in bed watching television . She put on her robe , went to the front door , opened the peephole in it and asked , " What is it ? " A man 's voice asked . " Is Jerry home ? " " You mean Mr. Giesler ? " she asked . " What is it in reference to ? " " I must see him , " the man said . " It 's important . " " I 'm sorry , " Mrs. Giesler said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturdays and Sundays . You 'll have to call him at his office Monday morning . " But the man was persistent . He kept saying , " It 's very urgent . I have to see him , " and Mrs. Giesler kept saying , " I 'm sorry , but you ca n't . " Finally the man said , " I 'll go over to the Beverly Hills Hotel and call him from there . " He did go over to the hotel and he did call me . He said that he was desperately in need of money , and he asked if I would lend him a little to tide him over . What burned Mrs. Giesler was that I 'd never seen the fellow in my life . He 'd gotten my address from the phone book . But although I knew nothing about him , I was softhearted enough to say I would lend him money . When Mrs. Giesler heard me say that , she excused herself and disappeared  --  downstairs . was fumbling in my pockets to see how much cash I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door and said through the peephole , " What do you think this is , a loan company ? Get out of here fast or I 'll call the police ! And it takes the Beverly Hills police only two minutes to get here ! " Our maid saw the stranger run like a deer past the kitchen window . The thought that I was about to lend money to a man I 'd never even heard of before is one Mrs. Giesler wo n't let me forget in a hurry . " If you 're that soft , " she told me , " I 'll make a few touches around here myself . " Mrs. Giesler has been a help to me in many other ways too . I used her as a mobile model in trying to work out in my mind just how things had happened in a case that another lawyer had tried and lost . I was asked to retry IL It involved an Italian triangle . My Italian client was charged with murder . He was charged with killing his wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom . The husband shot the man as he went through a door . A bullet killed his wife as she tried to get out through the same door . T It I was n't worried about defending my client for shooting the lover he had found in his own bed with his wife . There is no law which permits shooting under such circumstances , but it is only human to regard such a situation as extreme provocation . But when it comes to shooting a wife under the same circumstances  --  well , juries are apt to be more difficult . It was my client 's story that his wife had been hit by one of the bullets he had fired at the fleeing homewrecker . The only thing wrong with his story was that she had fallen facing her husband . At home with Mrs. Giesler , I tried to reenact that scene in the way my client said it had happened . Hour after hour I placed my wife by a door , took a gun  --  unloaded , of course  --  pointed it at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I pretended to fire . Finally it came to me . What had happened was the same thing that happens when a hunter hits a deer with a high-powered rifle . If you hit a deer in the shoulder when it 's running away from you , the force of the bullet is apt to spin him around . When her husband 's bullet had struck her , my client 's wife whirled and fell back into the room , facing him . When 1 used one of my associates to demonstrate this in the courtroom for the jury , they found the husband not guilty . I have been said by the press to " dress well , " whatever that means . If that is true , it 's because Mrs. Giesler selects my clothes . She has a tailor come to our house for fittings , and she chooses the fabrics . She even buys my shoes . I take her word for these things . She insists on laying out at night the clothes that I 'm going to wear the next morning , including my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The truth is , she takes care of me like a baby . She wo n't like my talking this way . She does n't want any credit for being a help to me . But I want to give her her due . She deserves it . There was a time when I 'd answer my phone anytime , day or night . Mrs. Giesler has made me cut down on that , lf someone needs me for something really important , she does n't object , but most of the people who call merely want to chew the fat about a case , or they are worried or nervous and they want someone to soothe them . Mrs. Giesler has a system to help me get a few hours ' rest when such calls come . She answers the telephone and says , " I 'm S AT tilt DAY ft VF , N I N ri 1 . ( 1ST sorry , I 'm a maid in the household , but I 've been given instructions not to awaken Mr. Giesler . " She says she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it 's not , she says , " You can call him in the morning at his office , after nine o'clock . " Most of the time they never call , and she says , " You see ! They 're just people who /magined they needed you . " The few times I 've tried to take a vacation I 've been unhappy , If I must go out of town on business , I 'm never out of touch with my office . If I 'm in New York , 1 call my office at least twice a day and ask my secretary , Mrs. Fitzpatrick , to read me the mail or tell me what telephone calls have come in . One year my wife persuaded me to go to Palm Springs with her . She thought that / should cut myself off from my office and have a complete rest . After making sure that it had no telephone , she rented a house near the springs . I tried to fall in with her idea , but I could n't stand it . Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times a day to call my office . The Friday before Easter I called Mrs. Fitzpatrick and said , " I wish you 'd drive down here and bring my mail and any messages . " When she arrived , I said , " You 'd better stay over the weekend . 1 think I 'll drive back with you Monday . " With me , work is a compulsion . It is necessary for my happiness . I 've been asked if I ever plan to retire . Mrs. Giesler puts it this way : " Every once in a while Jerry says that he might retire someday and take it easy ; but I do n't really believe it , not him ! " 1 talk about taking it easier , but since I 've tried to be honest all through this story , I 'll be honest to the very end . Mrs. Giesler is right . I do not plan to retire . I plan to die with my shoes on  --  preferably in a courtroom  --  but I may not be that lucky , There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own lawyers in acriminal court . As a youngster I was in court one day when one of those do-it-myself defenders was having his day in the sun . The judge was patiently waiting to sentence him , but the defendant had spent the morning making motion after motion , although they had all been denied . Finally , it neared noon and the judge asked wearily , " Have you any further motions before I pronounce sentence ? " " Yes , " the defendant said hurriedly . " Your honor , I move we adjourn . " Even the judge laughed . He could n't help it . But he did n't adjourn . He proceeded with the sentencing . Right now I feel the way that self-appointed defender must have felt , and on my own behalf I 'll say , as he said , " I move we adjourn. "
