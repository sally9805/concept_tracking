The scene is a large bare toilet built of gray rough cement . There are urinals along one wall and a partition separating them from the commodes which are along the same wall . The toilet must resemble the impersonal ugliness of a school toilet or a latrine of some institution . A few rolls of toilet paper are spread out on the floor , wet through . The actors should give the impression frequently that the place smells . Ora breaks through the door grinning , then giggling . Looks around the bleak place , walks around , then with one hand on his hip takes out his joint and pees , still grinning , into one of the commodes , spraying urine over the seat . WILLIE LOVE ( sticking his head through the door ) Big Shot ! Hey , Big Shot ! These guys say come and help them . ORA ( zipping his fly and wiping the one hand on the back of his pants ) Yeh ? ( Turning to LOVE . ) Yeh ? They got him , huh ? WILLIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Naw , they do n't have him yet . He 's on the second floor , running back and forth and hiding in empty rooms . But Knowles said for you to come help . ORA ( flushing all the commodes and urinals in the row as he walks past ) Sheet ! I 'll catch that bastid in a second . ( Ducks under Love 's arm to go out . ) Why the hell do n't you get up there . You supposed to be faster than me. p. 3 WILLIE LOVE I 'm s'posed to stay here and keep the place clear . ( Making a face . ) Damn . This place smells like hell . ORA ( without turning around ) Yeh ( giggling ) , this must be your momma 's house . WILLIE LOVE ( slipping inside the door and holding it against ORA ) Shit . At least I got one . ORA ( thumps against the door , not really angry ) Bastid ! LOVE waits a few seconds , then pulls the door open slightly . Then lets it shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet wipes it with some of the strewn toilet paper . He sits down and stretches his legs . Then gets up and opens the commode to pee . There are voices outside and then the door swings open and HINES and HOLMES come in . HINES Hey , Willie . WILLIE LOVE ( still peeing ) What you want ? ( Comes out , zipping his pants . ) HINES ( to HOLMES ) Man , this cat 's in here pulling his what-chamacallit. p. 4 JOHNNY BOY HOLMES ( to LOVE ) Yeh . Damn , Love , why do n't you go get Gloria to do that stuff for you . WILLIE LOVE She-et . ( Grinning . ) Huh . I sure do n't need your ol ' lady to be pullin ' on my joint . ( Laughs . HOLMES begins to spar with him . ) HINES They did n't even catch that skinny nose punk yet . WILLIE LOVE No ? Why in hell not ? JOHNNY BOY HOLMES He 's still running up and down the damn halls . I should go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to pee also in the commodes . LOVE pulls open the door a small bit and looks out . WILLIE LOVE Shit . Boy , all you slow ass cats . I 'd catch that little skinny paddy boy in a second . Where 's that little popeyed Foots ? HINES Damn if I know . I think he 's still in Miss Powell 's class . You know if he missed her class she 'd beat his head , and then get his ol ' lady to beat his head again . JOHNNY BOY HOLMES Shit . Skippy should 've got hold of that damn Karolis by now . He ai n't fast worth a bitch . p. 5 WILLIE LOVE Yeh , but he 's so goddamned scary he might just jump out a goddamn window . HOLMES finishes peeing and starts pushing LOVE and they begin to spar around . HOLMES is very funny , making boxer-like sounds and brushing his nose continuously with his thumbs . LOVE just stands straight with his left hand stiff and stabbing it out toward Holmes ' face . HINES finishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOLMES are against LOVE , who starts to laugh and curse good naturedly . WILLIE LOVE Two a ' you bastids , huh ? I 'll take you both . ( He starts kicking at them . ) HINES Boy , if you kick me , you 'll die just like that . . . with your skinny ass leg up . They 'll have to build you a special coffin with a part for your leg . JOHNNY BOY HOLMES ( backing away , and then turning on HINES . Laughing ) Let 's get this sum'bitch , Willie . HINES ( backing away , now kicking and swinging . . . but just timing blows so they wo n't strike anyone ) Goddamn , Johnny Boy , you a crooked muthafucka . You cats think you can mess with the kid ? The two spar against HINES and then LOVE turns against HOLMES . p. 6 WILLIE LOVE Let 's get this little assed cat . HOLMES kicks at them , then jumps up on the commodes in order to defend himself more " heroically . " JOHNNY BOY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm just trying to help you out and you gon na play wise . Ya ' bastid . HINES Listen to that cat . ( Runs after HOLMES . ) I 'm gon na put your damn head in one of those damn urinals . He and LOVE finally grab HOLMES and he begins struggling with them in earnest . Let 's put this little bastard 's head in the goddamn urinal ! JOHNNY BOY HOLMES You bastids ! Let me go ! I 'm gon na cut somebody . Bastids ! The door opens and ORA comes in . His shirt is torn . But he rushes over laughing and starts punching everyone , even HOLMES . HINES Goddamn it , Big Shot , get the hell out of here . JOHNNY BOY HOLMES Get ' em , Big Shot . ORA ( punches HOLMES who 's still being held by LOVE ) I 'm gon na punch you , you prick . Hold the cocksucker , Love . WILLIE LOVE ( releasing HOLMES immediately ) I ai n't gon na hold him so you can punch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faking professional demeanor. p. 7 WILLIE LOVE Hey , Big Shot , what happened to your shirt ? ORA ( putting his hands down and handling the torn part of his shirt ) That muthafuckin ' Karolis ripped it . The other three yowl . HINES puts his fingers to the hole as if to tear it again.Get outta here you black ass bastid . ( He squares off at HINES , then pushes him away . ) That paddy bastid ! I had the cocksucker around the waist , and then he rips my shirt and scratches me . ( He holds up his wounded hand . ) HINES You let him get away ? ORA No , hell . I punched the bastid right in his lip . But he was making so much noise we thought somebody 'd come out and see us so Knowles and Skippy took him in the broom closet and I cut down the stairs . The stupid bastid was screaming and biting right outside of ol ' lady Powell 's room . JOHNNY BOY HOLMES Did anybody come outta there ? ORA You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She and Miss Golden after me anyway . WILLIE LOVE Did you see Foots in there ? ORA ( going to the door and peering out ) Yeh . And George Davis and Perry are in there too . ( He pushes door open and leans all the way out. ) p. 8 HINES Shit . They 're never gon na bring that sonofabitch down here . We ai n't got all day . ORA ( letting the door shut ) Yeh , Perry and Foots and them ought to be down here in a few minutes . It 's almost 3:00 now . WILLIE LOVE ( pretending he has a basketball in his hands , he pretends to dribble and lunges forward simulating a fake at HINES , then he sweeps past HINES and leaps in the air as if making a layup shot ) Peed on you , just then , buddy . HINES Sheet , Man , you what you call a self-checker . I do n't even have to block that shot . I just take it off the backboard like this . ( He spins around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginary ball off , landing and shaking his head as if to shake off imaginary defenders . ) Another rebound ! ( Makes motion of long pass down toward opposite " court . " ) Now , the fast break ( He moves in position for his own pass , receives it , makes one long stepping dribble and leaps as if dunking the ball in the basket . ) Two ! JOHNNY BOY HOLMES Boy , you guys sure play a lot of ball . . . off the court . ORA ( opening the door again ) No Shootin ' cocksuckas. p. 9 WILLIE LOVE ( still whirling and leaping as if he is making successful hook shots from an imaginary foul line ) Hey , what we gon na do to this cat when he gets here ? ORA ( leaning back in from the door though keeping it open with his fingers ) Damn , Love . You a stupid bastid . ( Peeks out door . ) We gon na kick that little frail bastid 's ass . HINES In fact , you the one gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Love . ( Blocking one of Love 's " shots . " ) WILLIE LOVE Shit . Karolis never bothered me . ( Faking HOLMES and swinging to shoot from the other side . ) ORA ( looking back in and letting the door swing shut ) Damn , Willie ( in mocking seriousness ) , Karolis is always telling everybody how he bangs the hell out of Caroline , every chance he gets . ( Begins to giggle . ) JOHNNY BOY HOLMES Is that your mother 's name , Love , Caroline ? HINES ( busy trying to lift a back window to look out on the yard ) What you mean , Johnny Boy , is that his mother 's name ? You the one told me. p. 10 WILLIE LOVE ( swinging around as if to shoot again he suddenly punches HOLMES on the shoulder . HOLMES lets out a yelp of pain ) Uhhuh . . . I told you about messin ' with me . JOHNNY BOY HOLMES ( holding his shoulder ) Shit . Why did n't you hit Big Shot , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the door propped open again ) Shit . That narrow head bastid know better than to fuck with me . ( He peers out the door and as he does LOVE gestures as if to hit him in the back . ) JOHNNY BOY HOLMES ( to LOVE ) You scared ass bastard . Why do n't you do it ? ORA ( turning around and throwing up his hands to defend himself ) Yeh , I wish you would , you bullet head sonofabitch . HOLMES goes and sits on a radiator next to HINES . WILLIE LOVE Man , nobody 's thinking about you , Big Shot . ( He goes to pee . ) ORA ( pulling the door open again ) Here come Perry and them . p. 11 JOHNNY BOY HOLMES ( jumping off the radiator still holding his shoulder ) Perry and who else ? ORA George Davis and Donald Farrell . HINES Donald Farrell ? What the hell 's he doin ' down here ? Where the hell is Foots ? WILLIE LOVE Yeh , what the hell is Perry doing bringing Farrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door open , and PERRY , DAVIS and FARRELL come in . PERRY Hey , what 's happening ? JOHNNY BOY HOLMES Shit . I should ask you . Where 's Foots ? GEORGE DAVIS He had to stay upstairs for awhile . Powell wanted to talk to him . . . or something . ORA ( to FARRELL ) Man , whatta you want down here ? Nobody asked you to come . GEORGE DAVIS I told him he could come . Why not ? ORA Whatta you mean , why not ? You know goddamn well , why not . Silly sumbitch ! PERRY Ah , Big Shot , why do n't you be cool for a change , huh ? GEORGE DAVIS Yeh , man , Big Shot . Donald 's not going to hurt anything . p. 12 ORA No ? ( Taking out a much-smoked cigarette butt . ) Maybe you do n't think so . . . but I do . GEORGE DAVIS Oh , man , shit . DONALD FARRELL Why do n't you want me here , Big Shot ? ORA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me questions . DONALD FARRELL Do n't ask you questions ? Why the hell not ? ORA ( menacingly at FARRELL ) Cause I said so , that 's why You do n't like it , muthafucka ? PERRY ( stepping between them ) Goddamn it , Big Shot , why do n't you sit your ass down for awhile and shut the hell up ? ORA ( turning to PERRY ) You gon na make me , muthafucka ? PERRY ( stepping to face ORA ) I can . And you better believe it , Baby ! ORA Shit . ( Disparagingly . Moving away from FARRELL and back to the center of the room . ) Well you damn sure got your chance right now , you black sonofabitch. p. 13 GEORGE DAVIS ( moves between PERRY and ORA ) Oh , goddamnit why do n't both you guys sit down . You too , Donald . FARRELL moves to sit on a radiator beside HOLMES and HINES . Ora , you wrong , man , and you know it . ORA How come I 'm wrong , huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( at FARRELL ) ai n't got no business down here . He ai n't gon na do a damn thing but stand around and look . WILLIE LOVE ( laughing ) That 's all I 'm gon na do . HINES ( hunching HOLMES with his elbow ) Yeh , but that 's okay for you , Willie . You so black , if you stand still nobody 'll know you 're standing there anyway . All laugh . ORA takes the opportunity to go to the door and crack it open . PERRY Where 's the rest of those guys ? HINES I guess they must still be upstairs in that broom closet . PERRY Broom closet ? He and DAVIS lean against one of the walls and begin to smoke . HINES Yeh , Knowles and Skippy got Karolis upstairs in a broom closet waiting till everybody leaves the floor I guess . p. 14 DONALD FARRELL Jimmy Karolis ? JOHNNY BOY HOLMES Yeah , that 's who we 're waiting for . ( Giggles . ) DONALD FARRELL What the hell 's gon na happen then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell you care , huh ? Pee-the-bed-muthafucka ! HINES Damn , George ! GEORGE DAVIS Damn , what ? HINES Seems to me like Big Shot 's right . You bring this cat down here and he does n't even know what 's happening . ORA You goddamn real I 'm right . Simple ass cats . DONALD FARRELL What 're you guys gon na gang Jimmy Karolis ? ORA We gon na break that muthafucka 's back . DONALD FARRELL For what ? ORA Look man , why do n't you shut up and get the hell out of here , huh ? DONALD FARRELL You mean all you guys 're gon na jump on Karolis ? ORA ( walking over to FARRELL and grabbing him by the shirt ) You gon na stick up for him ? FARRELL tries to push Ora 's hands from his shirt , and though he is much taller than ORA , ORA pulls him from his seat . p. 15 DONALD FARRELL Goddamn it , Ora , why do n't you cut the shit ? GEORGE DAVIS Yeh , Ora , cut it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bad . GEORGE comes over to restrain ORA , but ORA succeeds in punching FARRELL in the stomach . FARRELL clutches his stomach and sinks to the floor groaning . PERRY ( to ORA ) You bastard . ORA swings around to confront him . ORA You come on too , if you want to , you black sonofabitch ! GEORGE pushes them apart again and his push sends ORA rattling heavily against the door . Goddamnit , George , why do n't you stay the fuck out of this ? GEORGE DAVIS Because there was n't a goddamn reason in the world for you to hit Donald like that . ( Going to help FARRELL up . ) Damn , Ora , you 're a wrong sonofabitch , you know that ? DONALD FARRELL ( still doubled up and holding his stomach . He pulls his arm back when GEORGE tries to help him up ) No , man ! Lemme stay here . ( Still groaning . ) Ora , you dirty cocksucker. p. 16 ORA Boy , you better shut up before I stomp mudholes in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KNOWLES and SKIPPY come in holding KAROLIS by the arms . Karolis ' head is hanging , and he is crying softly and blood is on his shirt and face . His hair is mussed and standing all over his head . WILLIE LOVE Ga-uh damn ! What 'd you cats do ? KNOWLES ( giggling stupidly ) Love , now what the hell does it look like we did ? Broke this muthafucka 's jaw . HINES Damn . I thought we were just bringing the cat down here to fight Foots . I did n't know you guys were gon na break his head first . SKIPPY Well , he did n't wan na come . We had to persuade him . KNOWLES Shit , Skippy , whatta you mean " we ? " I did all the persuading . ORA Aw , shit , Knowles . I bloodied the cat 's lip . You trying to take all the credit . SKIPPY Yeh , Knowles . You did n't hit the cat but once , and that was on the goddamn shoulder . Letting KNOWLES drag KAROLIS into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat was doing all the time we was in that goddamn broom closet ? Tellin ' jokes . ( Laughs . ) They must not a been funny either . Karolis did n't laugh once . p. 17 KNOWLES What should I do with this guy . I got ta drag him everywhere . ORA Drop him in that goddamn corner . ( Walks over to corner and nudges KAROLIS with his foot . ) Hey , muthafucka . Hey ! Why do n't you straighten up ? SKIPPY ( noticing FARRELL , who is still crumpled in an opposite corner , but stirring ) Damn ! What the hell happened to Donald ? PERRY That goddamn Big Shot had to show how bad he was . ORA ( laughing paradoxically ) He called me a nigger . All laugh . WILLIE LOVE Well , what the hell are you ? Wha 's the matter , you shamed of your people ? ORA Fuck you ! ( He still stands over KAROLIS , nudging him with his foot . ) Hey , man , get up ! ( Laughs . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cat alone ? ORA ( bending over as if to talk in KAROLIS ' ear ) Hey , baby , why do n't you get up ? I got ta nice fat sausage here for you . p. 18 GEORGE DAVIS Goddamn , Big Shot . . . You really a wrong sonofabitch ! ORA Look man . ( Now kneeling over the slumped figure . ) If you want to get in on this you line up behind me . I do n't give a shit what you got to say . WILLIE LOVE Man , George , leave the cat alone . You know that 's his stick . That 's what he does ( laughing ) for his kicks . . . rub up against half-dead white boys . All laugh . ORA ( looking over his shoulder . . . grudgingly having to smile too ) I 'd rub up against your momma too . ( Leaning back to KAROLIS . ) Come on , baby . . . I got this fat ass sa-zeech for you ! WILLIE LOVE Ora , you mad cause you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against . All laugh . ORA ( turns again , this time less amused ) Fuck you , you bony head sonofabitch . As long as I can rub against your momma . . . or your fatha ' ( laughs at his invention ) I 'm doin ' alright . Door is pushed open suddenly and FOOTS comes in . He is nervous but keeps it hidden by a natural glibness and a sharp sense of what each boy in the room expects , singularly , from him . He is the weakest physically and smallest of the bunch , but he is undoubtedly their leader . When FOOTS comes in KAROLIS looks up quickly , then slumps again . p. 19 HINES Man , where the hell you been ? FOOTS That goddamn Van Ness had me in his office . He said I 'm a credit to my race . ( Laughs and all follow . ) He said I 'm smart-as-a-whip ( imitating Van Ness ) and should help him to keep all you unsavory ( again imitating ) elements in line . All laugh again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? FOOTS Well , he seems to think that you guys . . . particularly that goddamn Big Shot and Knowles , are not good influences in this joint . PERRY Boy , you can say that again . Nutty muthafuckas ! ORA ( to PERRY ) Fuck you , tar baby ! FOOTS Well , I 'm supposed to make sure that you guys do n't do anything bad to anybody . Especially to James Karolis . ( Laughing . ) GEORGE DAVIS Oh yeh ? He know about that ? FOOTS Yeh , somebody told him Knowles said he was gon na kick Karolis ' ass . ( Seeing KAROLIS in the corner for the first time . His first reaction is horror and disgust . . . but he keeps it controlled as is his style , and merely half-whistles . ) Goddamn ! What the fuck happened to him ? ( He goes over to KAROLIS and kneels near him , threatening to stay too long . He controls the impulse and gets up and walks back to where he was . He is talking throughout his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kill the cat ? p. 20 PERRY Heavy handed Big Shot again . FOOTS ( looks at ORA quickly with disgust but softens it immediately to comic disdain ) What the hell you hit him with , Ora , a goddamn train ? ORA ( happy at the notice of his destruction ) No , man , I just bopped him in the mouth with the back of my hand . FOOTS Ga-uhd damn ! You a rough ass cat , Shot . He sure do n't look like he 's in any way to fight anybody . ORA ( laughing ) No , but he might be able to suck you off . Hee , hee . WILLIE LOVE Shit . You the one that look like you want that , Big Shot . FOOTS Oh , shit . There was n't any need of bringing the cat down here if you guys were gon na fuck him up before I got here . He was supposed to fight me . ( Almost angry . ) HINES Yeh , that 's what I thought . You should n't of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only person I asked to go up was Skippy . SKIPPY Well , the sonofabitch would n't come . . . so , I got Superduck over there to help me . I did n't ask Ora to come . Knowles did . p. 21 KNOWLES Oh , man , the cat 's here . Get him up on his feet ( laughs ) then knock him down . That 's all . That do n't seem like no big problem to me . ( Through most of the action KNOWLES is drumming on the walls or the window or the door or the floor , in a kind of drum and bugle corps beat . . . also supplying the bugle parts vocally . ) WILLIE LOVE Man , Knowles , why do n't you stop being a goddamn Elk all the time . Damn . That cat 's always drumming on something . Why do n't you get a goddamn drum ? KNOWLES I 'm going to drum on your bony head in a little while if you do n't shut up . FOOTS Well , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just pour water on the cat and let 's get outta here . ORA What ? You mean you made us go through all this bullshit for nothing ? FOOTS Well , what the hell am I gon na do , beat on the guy while he 's sprawled on the floor . Damn , Ora , you 're a pretty lousy sonofabitch . HINES Man , Big Shot 'd stomp anybody in any damn condition . He likes it when they 're knocked out first , especially . FOOTS I 'm pushed ! There 's no reason to stay here . I ca n't fight the guy like he is. p. 22 DONALD FARRELL ( who has pushed himself up and is leaning against the wall ) I sure am glad somebody 's got some sense here . FOOTS ( seeing FARRELL for the first time ) What the hell you doing here ? Who asked you to come here , huh ? ( Embarrassed and angry . ) ORA That stupid ass Perry brought him . PERRY That 's right . I just thought there was gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gon na lynch anybody . FOOTS Lynch , your ass . Look , Donald , why do n't you leave , huh ? Nobody needs you here . DONALD FARRELL ( slowly ) Yeh , okay , Ray . But I just want to know why you 're gon na beat up on Jimmy like this . What the hell did he do to you ? FOOTS ( almost indignantly ) None of your goddamn business , Farrell . Just leave ! ORA Yeh , man . I should 've thrown your ass out when you first come in here . Pee-the-bed sonofabitch . DONALD FARRELL O.K. ( Stands up , still lightly holding his stomach . ) O.K. But I want to take Jimmy out of here with me . He ca n't fight anybody . p. 23 ORA Man , you better shut your goddamn mouth and get outta here ! FOOTS Look , Donald , just leave , that 's all . You hear ? ( Turns his back on FARRELL and walks toward KAROLIS , then thinking better of it turns toward FARRELL again . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guy up when he 's like that are you ? FOOTS I do n't need you to tell me what to do . ( He goes over and pulls the door open slightly . ) Just get out of here . . . now ! DONALD FARRELL ( takes a step then looks toward KAROLIS ) But look at him , he ca n't do anything . ( To FOOTS . ) Why do you want to do this ? FOOTS Goddamn it , get out ! DONALD FARRELL That 's no answer . FOOTS Man , I 'll punch you in the belly myself . DONALD FARRELL Shit . ( Disparagingly. . . which makes FOOTS madder . ) FOOTS ( in low horrible voice ) Goddamnit . You better get the fuck outta here , right now ! p. 24 DONALD FARRELL Nobody 's gon na tell me why ? ( He starts to move for the door . ) PERRY Look , Donald , you better cool it , Buddy . You heard about that letter did n't you ? DONALD FARRELL Letter ? What letter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not gon na tell you again . PERRY ( laughing ) The letter Karolis sent Foots telling him he thought he was " beautiful " . . . and that he wanted to blow him . All giggle . DONALD FARRELL ( turning sharply toward FOOTS ) A letter ? ORA ( rushing at FARRELL from the side and punching him ) Goddamn it ! Did n't you hear somebody say leave , pee ass ? FOOTS ( pushing between FARRELL and ORA ) Cut it out , Ora ! DONALD FARRELL ( hurt again and slumping . ORA tries to hit him again and the punch is blocked by FOOTS who glares savagely at ORA ) A letter ? ( Groaning . ) Oh , Ray , come on . Why do n't you come off it ? ( He is looking up at FOOTS. ) p. 25 ORA ( leaps around FOOTS and pushes FARRELL into the door ) Get out of here you dumb bastid ! KNOWLES pulls the door open and shoves FARRELL through it.Goddamn , what a stupid punk . ( He laughs , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the closed door for a second , then he turns slowly to the others ) Look , let 's get out of here . This stuff is finished . JAMES KAROLIS ( has brought his head up during the preceding scuffle , and has been staring at FOOTS . As FOOTS and the others look over toward him , he speaks very softly , but firmly ) No . Nobody has to leave . I 'll fight you , Ray . ( He begins to pull himself up . He is unsteady on his feet , but determined to get up . . . and to fight . ) I want to fight you . FOOTS is startled and his eyes widen momentarily , but he suppresses it . HINES Damn . Some guys do n't know when they 're well off . ORA Yeh . You little skinny muthafucka . You should 've kept your mouth shut , and played dead . KNOWLES Goddamn . You mean that sonofabitch wasn ' dead ? Shit , Big Shot , you must hit like a girl . p. 26 ORA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , you bastid . KNOWLES ( disparagingly ) Shit . JAMES KAROLIS ( pushing himself off the wall slightly and wiping his face with his sleeve ) No , Ray . Do n't have them leave . I want to fight you . FOOTS ( very silent and stiff , not wanting to be pushed ) Oh ? ( Slowly . ) Well , that 's damn fine with me . ORA ( going behind KAROLIS and pushing him toward FOOTS ) You wan na fight ? Well , go ahead , dick licker . ( Howls . ) HINES Yeh , get it on , fellas . JOHNNY BOY HOLMES Karolis must be bad . ( Laughs . ) GEORGE DAVIS Man ( to KAROLIS ) you sure you want to get in this ? You look kinda shaky to me . SKIPPY Man , just sit down and watch . This might be good . JAMES KAROLIS Yes , Ray , I want to fight you , now . I want to kill you . ( His voice is still soft and terrible . The word " kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turns his head slightly to look KAROLIS in the eye , but he is motionless otherwise. ) p. 27 ORA Goddamn it , fight ! He pushes KAROLIS again . This time KAROLIS almost bumps FOOTS and FOOTS throws up his hands and pushes him away . FOOTS Goddamn you ! Goddamn you ! ( His body moves from being completely immobile to an angry snarling figure . ) You bastard ! ( The others become animated , clapping their hands , shouting , whistling , and moving around as if they were also fighting . ) JAMES KAROLIS No , Ray . I want to fight you . ( He is moving around now , but his hands are still held tightly and awkwardly at his sides . ) I want to fight you . FOOTS ( moving around with his hands up to fight . They both move around each other and FOOTS seems to get momentarily , a change of heart ) Look now , Karolis. . . you 're just gon na get your head blocked . JAMES KAROLIS ( as if he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sent you a note , remember . That note saying I loved you . ( The others howl at this . ) The note saying you were beautiful . ( Tries to smile . ) You remember that note , Ray ? p. 28 FOOTS Goddamn it , if you 're going to fight , fight you cock-sucker ! JAMES KAROLIS Yeh . That 's what I 'm going to do Ray . I 'm going to fight you . We 're here to fight . About that note , right ? The one that said I wanted to take you into my mouth . FOOTS lunges at KAROLIS and misses.Did I call you Ray in that letter . . . or Foots ? ( Trying to laugh . ) Foots ! ( Shouts . ) I 'm going to break your fucking neck . That 's right . That 's who I want to kill . Foots ! ORA ( pushing KAROLIS into FOOTS ) Fight , you goddamn sissy-punk bastid ! FOOTS ( slaps KAROLIS with his open hand ) You crazy bastard ! JAMES KAROLIS ( backing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to fight ) Are you Ray or Foots , huh ? The crowd begins to move forward to cut down the area of the match so that the two fighters will have to make contact . HINES Hit the sonofabitch , Foots ! FOOTS Fight , you bastard ! JAMES KAROLIS Yeh ! That 's why we 're here , huh ? I 'll fight you , Foots ! ( Spits the name . ) I 'll fight you . Right here in this same place where you said your name was Ray . ( Screaming . He lunges at FOOTS and manages to grab him in a choke hold . ) Ray , you said your name was . You said Ray . Right here in this filthy toilet . You said Ray . ( He is choking FOOTS and screaming . FOOTS struggles and is punching KAROLIS in the back and stomach , but he can not get out of the hold . ) You put your hand on me and said Ray ! p. 29 SKIPPY Goddamn , that bastid is choking the shit out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the advantage . HINES That fuck is trying to kill Foots ! JOHNNY BOY HOLMES Goddamn it ! ORA ( suddenly leaping on Karolis ' back , puts the same choke hold on him ) You cocksucka. . . how 's that feel , huh ? ( He pulls KAROLIS off of FOOTS who falls to his knees . ) Huh ? KNOWLES Let 's kick this cocksucka 's ass real good . He rushes up to help ORA , and the whole of the crowd surges into the center punching the fallen KAROLIS in the face . KNOWLES is screaming with laughter . JAMES KAROLIS No , no , his name is Ray , not Foots . You stupid bastards . I love somebody you do n't even know . He is dragged to the floor . The crowd is kicking and cursing him . ORA in the center punching the fallen KAROLIS in the face . KNOWLES is screaming with laughter . FOOTS is now on his hands and knees but his head hangs limply and he is unaware of what is happening . He slumps again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the center of the floor and is unmoving . ORA drapes some of the wet toilet paper across his body and face . p. 30 ORA Let 's stick the sonofabitch 's head in the damn toilet . PERRY Oh , man , fuck you . The cat 's completely out . What more can you do to him ? GEORGE DAVIS Yeh , let 's get Foots , and get outta here before somebody comes in . ORA Yeh . Hee , hee . Look at ol ' Foots . That fuckin ' paddy boy almost kilt him . WILLIE LOVE Yeh . ( Laughing . ) I told you Karolis was probably bad ! All laugh . KNOWLES Nutty sonofabitch . WILLIE LOVE ( picking up FOOTS , helped by HINES and HOLMES ) Hey , big eye ! Get the hell up . ORA ( takes a paper cup and dips it in the commode and throws it in Foots ' face ) Yeh , get up , bad ass . ( Laughs . ) They all leave , as FOOTS begins to come to . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before in the center of the room , motionless . After a minute or so KAROLIS moves his hand . Then his head moves and he tries to look up . He draws his legs up under him and pushes his head off the floor . Finally he manages to get to his hands and knees . He crawls over to one of the commodes , pulls himself up , then falls backward awkwardly and heavily . At this point , the door is pushed open slightly , then it opens completely and FOOTS comes in . He stares at Karolis ' body for a second , looks quickly over his shoulder , then runs and kneels before the body , weeping and cradling the head in his arms . BLACK
