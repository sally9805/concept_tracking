It commuted the death sentences of 44 blacks awaiting execution , including four who were within 40 minutes of hanging , to varying terms of imprisonment . Still awaiting word about their fate are 69 others held in the death row of Salisbury 's maximum-security prison . Their number swelled at week 's end with the sentencing to death of five Africans convicted of entering Rhodesia with " weapons of war " -a newly created capital offense .
