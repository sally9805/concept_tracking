The contemplative orders of the Roman Catholic Church are in trouble . Despite an upsurge of new recruits in the years following World War II , such orders as the Trappists , Poor Clares and Carmelites have recently suffered a loss in numbers as a result of defections and a decline in novices . <P> According to Vatican statistics issued last year , the Trappists and Carmelites alone experienced a drop of nearly 700 members in the preceding twelve months . In most U.S. Trappist monasteries , membership is down by some 50% from postwar peaks ; the abbey in Piffard , N.Y. , which once harbored 76 monks , has only 36 today . In France , the number of cloistered nuns has dropped in the past decade , forcing 47 convents to close . <P> Superiors of contemplative societies attribute the defections to what they term today 's " Peace Corps mentality " - the desire of many young Catholics to serve God by good deeds in the world rather than through a life of prayer . Another problem is that the monastic orders , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slower than most other branches to adopt the reforming spirit of the Second Vatican Council-although they are beginning to do so . Last year the Trappists modified their centuries-old tradition of silence , now allow monks more freedom to speak under certain circumstances . A number of convents have removed the forbidding iron-bar grilles that once separated the nuns from visitors . <P> Abbots and abbesses of contemplative communities believe that more changes are necessary-most notably , greater contact with the secular world . But renewal is proceeding slowly , partly because of the opposition of older monks and nuns who resent any departure from tradition .
