If France Is Condemned by Jean Daniel Paris This is the sixth year and the sixth time that the problem of Algeria has been entered on the agenda of the General Assembly . Once more , the corridors of the UN are thoroughfares for intrigue , for maneuverings of cliques and for struggles between factions . The power of lobbies , rather than ideas , will again be tested . Once more , the United States will seek to ascertain where its interest lies , will try to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds , will declare itself torn between the hard requirements of the Western Alliance and the new vision it cherishes of anti-colonialism in Africa . During a discussion I recently had in Paris with several Anglo-Saxon analysts , an American friend of mine asked a question which really went to the heart of the matter : " What point would there be in having France condemned ? " This summed up the whole discussion and summed up a number of other matters as well ? the internal situation in France , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West , and , finally , the limits of the UN 's role . If France were condemned by the UN , here is what we may anticipate . General de Gaulle , who has no great fondness for the world organizations , would be exasperated . Should the nations that he himself describes as " disunited " unite for the sole purpose of discrediting a French undertaking , it would simply heighten his instinctive xenophobia and that nationalistic fervor of his which is so notoriously characterized by suspicion and distrust . So much the better , one might say , for this will add to his difficulties in his own country . On the contrary : nothing could be less certain . For better or for worse , the United Nations has not sold itself to the French people . Upon one occasion when I was holding a conference in a very labor-minded milieu and had referred to the UN , a worker asked me whether I could lightheartedly accept the fact that the representatives of such-and-such a country in the Middle East , where slavery has not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still tortured , could pose as judges . He said : " I 'm willing to fight to wipe out torture in Algeria and put an end to the war , but I refuse to take lessons from unworthy teachers . " Still another worker claimed that " all that stuff is just a pack of nonsense : the UN is nothing but a theater , and the only actors are the Americans and the Russians . " If France is condemned , it will not diminish de Gaulle 's popularity at home . Nor , necessarily , will the French be made more aware of their responsibilities . It is also claimed that condemnation by the UN would demonstrate the world 's solidarity with the Algerian maquis , thus bringing very considerable pressure to bear on France . Let us examine this argument . Since such pressure could have little effect on an exasperated de Gaulle , it would have either to give rise to intervention by the UN in Algeria , or provoke internal conflict in France . The Congolese crisis at least showed us that the UN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle between East and West has never been more sharp than in the Congo ; we have once more seen that the UN simply reflects the contradictions of its own members . Furthermore it is obviously inconceivable that any intervention could take place without the interested country first expressing an appeal for such intervention . And here the question arises : Who is the interested country ? Would it be said that it is Algeria ? Alright , but which Algeria ? I know full well that the vast majority of the Moslems feel in their hearts that they are represented by the FLN government of Mr. Ferhat Abbas ; but his government does not control any portion of Algerian territory . Would it then be a question of framing a UN resolution which would attempt to impose a referendum or a plebiscite on Algeria , under UN supervision ? Again , such a resolution , though valid and legal , would have no effectiveness if it is not accepted by France . The truth is that the only hope such a resolution may further is the hastening of de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us consider the worst possibility ? or the best , as the case may be . Let us visualize the Russians and the Americans standing together in the UN , as they did on the Suez question , to condemn France , gambling on de Gaulle 's successor . What then ? The successors ? They are already waging public battle . Anyone in Paris can cite their names and titles . They are all partisans of French Algeria who believe that de Gaulle has betrayed the Constitution and the honor of the Army , and the commitments made on May 13 , 1958 . They are such persons as Georges Bidault , Jacques Soustelle , Antoine Pinay , Max Lejeune , Bourges-Maunoury , Roger Duchet and Lacost-Lareymondie . They are such leading military figures as Marshall Juin , Generals Salan , Jouhaud , and Lecomte , or Zeller . And who are all these men ? Certainly not Fascists in the Mussolinian sense of the word , nor yet in the Stalinist sense . But when all is said and done , in their passion for a French Algeria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in power just about any political regime which will permit them ( in their eyes ) to " preserve the integrity of France " and not abandon a single foot of national territory , including Algeria . What good would come from such a hazardous enterprise , which would be translated into massive and widespread war in Algeria and the unleashing in Metropolitan France of McCarthy-type methods manifest now only occasionally and fortuitously , but which could become the permanent order of the day ? At long last France would break free from her present equivocal situation , we are assured by the domestic and foreign enemies of de Gaulle . Most certainly ! But there are several ways of breaking free , and the way I have just described is perhaps not the best . Still , it is further claimed , Fascism would only last a short while , because the French people , imbued with a tradition of revolution , would not tolerate dictatorship for any length of time . And when , at long last , the French come to feel just as unhappy and just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms on the side of the Algerians ; and at the same time that it rids itself of its dictator , France will make peace with the FLN . This bit of revolutionary romanticism is believed by some very fine minds . I imagine that even the great philosopher and romantic , Jean-Paul Sartre , ac-cepts it . There is a whole section of Algerian leaders who also have lined up alongside these prestigious French intellectuals . Such an analysis is , of course , by no means without concern for the future . But the " reasoning " is the reasoning of despair , of the last desperate chance . It is also a harbinger of other schemes and other hopes . The compromise peace de Gaulle espouses fails to satisfy the French leftists , because a rallying of the leftists in response to a . Fascist challenge would be avoided and a popular front with the Communists would be pushed back still further . Nor does a compromise with de Gaulle satisfy the Algerian leaders party . After six years of war they want to bypass all temporizing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time establish a social or socialistic revolution in Algeria . To achieve this , they need to have complete and exclusive control of the government of an independent Algeria , very soon , and without " NeoColonists " or Western powers breaking the force of their forward sweep during a period of transition . And since they realize that they can only achieve a victory of this kind by extending the conflict or by almost any type of internationalization of the Algerian question , the positions of both the French leftists and the Algerian leaders is the same ? and understandably so . In my personal judgment , these hopes are irrational , and for one basic reason : When men are dying for an ideal , it is important to see how near they have come to victory , and whether or not the time is at hand to transform military warfare into political combat so that they may henceforth live for their ideal . Moreover , it is never wise to gamble on the probable destiny of any kind of Fascism . Who can know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period in which the West would be compelled to assist it , as the West is even now aiding Spain and Portugal ? In the end , we might all be compelled to give up hope where General de Gaulle is concerned ; France might be dragged gradually into Fascism ; and then perhaps as a last resort , we might wish to see France censured by the UN , to see an extension of the Algerian conflict , or internationalization in any form , and the overthrow of de Gaulle . But have we reached this point ? This is the vital question , and in all honesty , we must answer " no . " The domestic situation in France has not been stabilized ; it is often explosive , dangerously so . Nor can it be said that the Algerian war has become less horrible , or that the terrorism on the one hand and the repressive measures on the other hand have become less abominable . Atrocious massacres have taken place recently in Djebel ; there have been bombings of cinemas and cafes . On each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And finally , it must be admitted that de Gaulle has not abandoned his questionable tactics of maneuver , of indirection . Instead of negotiating , at a time when he has the power to do so , he follows a tortuous path full of ambushes and uncertainties . Since November 4 , however , he has at last emerged from his state of immobilization ; he has taken the offensive against all opposition ; he has staked his life ; he has hurled defiance . Above all , he is the first French Chief of State since 1830 , the date of the Algerian conquest , who has referred to an Algerian Republic as an entity separate from France , thus severing the umbilical cord which , in the eyes of the men who on May 13 , 1958 , swept him , de Gaulle , to power , united the two countries . I am compelled to recognize that this French General is fighting against the Army ; that this man of the Right nonetheless is holding out in opposition to the colonialist beliefs of the French reactionaries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is a fact that General de Gaulle has already conceded ? albeit only in principle ? almost all the objectives of the Algerian nationalists . The military aims of the latter have been in part achieved . And this is why , at thistime , I can not see that any interest would be served in having France condemned by the UN . During the discussion to which I alluded at the beginning of this article , an Englishman asked me if I did n't feel that it was precisely the threat of the CMnese and the Russians ( who are offering to aid the Algerians ) which finally made de Gaulle decide to act . Very possibly . Similarly , the action of the opposition in France , and the agitation provoked by the friends of Jean-Paul Sartre , could very well have influenced him . Similar pressures may also have been brought to bear since by the United States , through public opinion , or through diplomatic channels , within NATO , for example . However , this should in no way be taken to mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not hostile to pressure of this sort , I am simply skeptical as to the effects of UN condemnation . And above all , I believe that the UN would lead itself into an impasse and not advance the solution of the Algerian problem by a single step , while at the same time provoking in France a reaction which could only be chauvinistic.
