When auto-rich Art Collector Walter P. Chrysler Jr . presented a show called " The Controversial Century : 1850-1950 " at his own Chrysler Art Museum in Provincetown , Mass. , last summer , it included , predictably , some magnificent works from his impressive if erratic collection . But where it was bad , it was very , very bad-and the doubts of New York 's gossipy art world went beyond questions of taste to questions of authenticity . " It was hard to believe that the artists could have been that bad , " explains one Manhattan dealer . <P> This week the doubts went down on paper . After traveling to Ottawa , where " The Controversial Century " is on exhibition at the National Gallery of Canada , New York Times Art Critic John Canaday concluded : " Within this large and fine exhibition there is secreted a second and smaller one in which pedigrees are nonexistent or dubious , and attributions are arbitrary to such an extent that , the stylistic evidence being what it is , one must question them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all exceptional sketch of a young girl , a sketch with no signature , no date , shaky pedigree , and so far as I can see no direct kinship to a Degas , be offered as a Degas ? " Why should " an only moderately proficient painting called Le Trompeur and a pleasant but unexceptional still-life , without dates , signatures or certifications , be offered as Manets when the best you can say for them with certainty is that in a weak way they share certain characteristics of Manet 's art ? And when a painting is recognizable as a variation on a self-portrait by Van Gogh , yet is not above the technical level of an average copyist , can it really be defended as an original on no other documentation than its acquisition from ' Jean Neger , 1953 ' ? " <P> " Nobody is sure of such things , " says Manhattan Dealer Harry Yotnakparian. who sold Chrysler some of the questioned pictures . " Is it a Van Gogh or not a Van Gogh ? I do n't know . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain . He insisted : " I 'm satisfied with all the pictures . I do n't make any claim for their being the greatest examples of each artist ; but we ca n't look at masterpieces all the time . I think that would be rather dull . " <P> But dullness was hardly the issue .
