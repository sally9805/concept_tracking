txt Fugitive financier Lowell Birrell soon may come back from Brazil . This prospect is frightening to many lawyers , businessmen and politicians who at some , point during their careers brushed up against arch-swindler Birrell . For the general public , however , it promises fascinating revelations concerning a master manipulator . The Federal Government estimates Birrell looted a dozen or more corporate treasuries of about $50 million before he fled the country , a step ahead of the law in October 1957 . Within the last month , Birrell has been phoning old acquaintances in New York , discussing with them his possible return from his Brazilian sanctuary , and inquiring about such practical matters as bail . More importantly , it is known that he has been conferring with U.S. officials . One report , beginning to circulate in New York , is that Birrell is going to return voluntarily , tell all he knows about his associates and throw himself on the mercy of the court . In Washington , the Justice Department refuses to confirm or deny its representatives have talked with Birrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it clear they have n't given up hope of getting their hands on Birrell . For one thing , his asylum in Brazil is being threatened . An extradition treaty with Brazil has already been ratified by the U.S. Senate . It is now before the Brazilian legislature . Facing the Music ? ? Efforts to negotiate Birrell 's surrender could founder on many shoals , of course , but the threat to his asylum makes it more plausible that Birrell will agree to return voluntarily to face the music . As far back as last summer , in Rio de Janeiro , Birrell told a Wall Street Journal reporter he wanted to come back to the U.S. and answer the charges against him . At that time it was apparent Birrell was n't especially happy over his Brazilian exile . Paunchy and carelessly dressed , he no longer presented the appearance of a highly successful executive . He claimed his only income came from various jobs as a " management consultant " for companies he would n't name . Birrell had been a bold , brilliant , highliving crook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a decade . Companies he had controlled at one time or another included Swan-Finch Oil Corp. , Doeskin Products , Inc. , Claude Neon , Inc. , United Dye &; Chemical Corp. , American Leduc Petroleums and Equitable Plan Co . When it came to stealing from his stockholders , Birrell 's techniques ran the gamut . In some instances , he 'd resort to a complex corporate merger between companies he controlled . In others , he 'd employ the very simple expedient of sending an aide to the bank with a check for $10,000 ? made out to cash and drawn against one of his companies . He maintained a filing cabinet full of blank checks for just this purpose . On occasion Birrell utilized " quickie " bank loans to get enough money to take over a company . Once he got access to the company treasury he 'd dip into it to pay back the bank loan which enabled him to get control in the first place . A retired New York banker who has become somewhat of an expert on Birrell 's modus operandi says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan from a large bank . He is highly critical of the procedure : " I never made a loan like that in my 40 years in the banking business . " Boiler Room Business When two Birrell companies or subsidiaries merged , you could look for a great number of corporate shares to be issued , supposedly to pay stockholders of the company being acquired . A large number of these new shares , typically , would find their way into the hands of boiler rooms , high-pressure organizations which sell securities by phone at many times their true value . Typically , too , the shares would not have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission  --  a process which would have meant disclosing facts about the companies which Birrell preferred to keep to himself . It was the sale of unregistered stock in Swan-Finch Oil Corp. , whose stock was traded on the American Stock Exchange , that led to Birrell 's undoing in 1957 . The SEC secured a court order halting such sales and served a subpoena on Birrell to testify in the case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transfer his base of operations to that pleasant Caribbean island and the easygoing ethical climate which prevailed there during the Batista regime When Birrell made his getaway that autumn day six years ago , he left behind a tangled corporate web . Today , accountants , lawyers and trustees in bankruptcy are still trying to unravel the mess . A small army of attorneys still battles over civil cases growing out of Birrell 's shenanigans . Institutions only tangentially connected with Birrell 's operations find themselves embroiled in the litigation  --  Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. and the American Stock Exchange , to name two . Manufacturers Hanover is trying to fend off four law suits which together seek $27 million in damages . They 've been filed by trustees and receivers of companies Birrell looted . In effect , they contend that Manufacturers Trust Co. , prior to its 1961 merger with Hanover Bank , helped Birrell in his thievery by following sloppy banking practices . The bank denies all the charges . The American Stock Exchange faces a $5.7 million suit by trustees of Swan-Finch Oil Corp . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Birrell in a " larcenous scheme " Birrell devised to distribute to the public 578,000 Swan-Finch shares he fraudulently caused to be issued to himself . The exchange maintains it is innocent of the charges . If a talkative Lowell Birrell returns to the U.S. , he could conceivably have an impact on these two cases . His testimony could favor one side or the other . And these are by no means the only civil actions pending . In one Federal jurisdiction alone , New York 's Southern District , no less than nine Birrell cases are in the works . Birrell also faces three separate criminal cases . In New York City , District Attorney Frank Hogan is after him on 69 counts of grand larceny . Mr. Hogan claims Birrell stole $14 million from the stockholders of SwanFinch and Doeskin Products . The State of California wants Birrell on fraud charges and so too do Federal authorities in the Southern District of New York . If Birrell should decide to talk , there 's no telling whom else he might involve in these criminal matters . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good many people ? some of them perfectly innocent and others not so innocent ? as fronts . Consider for a moment the fascinating tale of how he continued to run Doeskin Products after he fled the United States . A month before Birrell left the country . While he was still board chairman of Doeskin , the company issued 1,070,000 shares of its stock , supposedly at $2 a share , to a Cuban named Jose Capmany acting as a nominee for unnamed principals . The shares were issued all right , but the money never found its way into the Doeskin treasury . Four years later , Federal Judge Edmund L. Palmieri ruled in effect that the transaction was fictitious . Capmany , in reality , was acting in behalf of Birrell . Thus when Birrell fled to Havana , he found waiting for him there one million odd shares of Doeskin , out of a total of 2.5 million shares . These million shares had cost him nothing , and they were to enable him to retain control of Doeskin . One of the first moves Birrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as officers and directors of Doeskin . Under Birrell 's watchful eye they proceeded to run the company until February 1958 when he replaced them with a new set of front men from Canada . The Canadian regime was headed by a Montreal attorney named Samuel J. Smiley who ostensibly came into the picture by buying 1 million of the 1,070,000 Doeskin shares from the Cubans at $1 a share . The day after the Canadians took over , they met in Birrell 's Havana apartment to receive their instructions . Thereupon , in the words of the plaintiff in one suit against Birrell , " Birrell and his new fronts embarked upon a systematic looting of Doeskin for their mutual benefit . " The Smiley Regime The Smiley regime at Doeskin lasted over two years  --  until September 1960 when Smiley resigned as chairman . Two months later Smiley and seven others , including Birrell , were indicted on charges of manipulating the 1,070,000 shares of Doeskin . Smiley ultimately pleaded guilty and is currently serving a jail sentence for his part in the stock fraud case . If one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doeskin stock absolutely free , his subsequent actions illustrate what a brash bandit he was . Two instances come to mind : In January 1958 , three months after Birrell had fled , the nominees he bad running Doeskin sued the SEC for $1 million . Their claim : Jose Capmany had been going to pay $2.50 a share for the Doeskin stock . But an SEC warning that the issue might be illegal caused him to withdraw the $2.50 offer and enabled him eventually to buy the stock at only $2.00 a share . Inasmuch as the whole transaction was a sham , Birrell 's audacious attempt to put the SEC on the defensive was wonderfully imaginative . A Federal judge , however , threw out the case two weeks after it was filed . In another instance , Birrell 's shenanigans with the 1,070,000 shares were more successful . Through a nominee , he sold back to Doeskin 70,000 of the shares he 'd never paid for in the first place . Doeskin wired the $100,000 it had agreed to pay for the shares to a Montreal bank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the funds at the bank . Instead of taking them to the local brokerage house handling the transaction , she flew to Havana and gave the money to Birrell . Weird and Wonderful In the weird and wonderful world of Lowell Birrell nothing seemed impossible . Despite there being a warrant out for his arrest , Birrell kept making trips into the U.S. , first from Cuba and later from Brazil . He showed up . for instance , at the annual meeting of Bartels Brewing Co. in Edwardsville , Pa. , on May 21 , 1958 ? months after he 'd become a fugitive . Birrell bad been president of Bartels when he fled in 1957 . In the Equitable Plan Co. bankruptcy case , a lawyer questioned William Mears , who succeeded Birrell as president of Bartels , concerning the Birrell visit to the brewery 's 1958 annual meeting : Q. By the time he came up to Edwardsville in May 1958 , you knew that a bench warrant was out for his arrest ? A. That 's right . Q. And you knew he was a fugitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up there under subterfuge ? A. That 's right . Q. Did you introduce him to anybody there ? A. Governor Fine ( John Fine had been Governor of Pennsylvania from 1951 to 1955 . At the time of the 1958 meeting he was an attorney for the brewing company ) . Q. You introduced him to Governor Fine ? A. That 's right . Q. As whom ? A. Lowell M. Birrell . Q. Did you tell Governor Fine he was the fellow the bench warrant was out for ? A. No sir . Birrell was also seen during 1958 in fashionable New York restaurants on two different occasions . How did he do it ? He had a Canadian passport issued under the name of Lowell , being his middle name . Then he coolly came and went pretty much at will . Birrell 's Whereabouts One man involved in litigation against Birrell has compiled a running record of what he believes were Birrell 's movements in the U.S. during 1958 . It shows the peripatetic financier as being in New York City on two different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times ( Birrell had a romantic interest there , it is contended ) , in Montreal four times and in Wilkes Barre , Pa. , once , the night before the Bartels annual meeting . Typically , Birrell arranged to have others pick up the tab for as much of his travel expenses as he could manage . Lowell , for instance , had an American Express credit card for which Bartels Brewing was being charged . He had other credit cards covering airline fares and telephone calls which were charged to Doeskin Products . Birrell was still armed with the American Express card in January of 1959 , 15 months after he 'd gone into exile . On Jan. 17 he used the card to take care of his bill at the Post &; Paddock Restaurant in Miami Beach . Jan. 20 he signed a $335.02 charge at the Golden Strand Hotel in Miami Beach and on Jan. 27 , he lunched at the Golden Door Restaurant at New York 's Idlewild airport , courtesy of his credit card . In 1960 a New York attorney received a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice at the other end of the wire . There are also reports of the fugitive Birrell staying quietly in a Miami mansion , the guest of a prominent industrialist . If Birrell should return and choose to talk about his comings and goings into the U.S. between 1958 and 1960 , and perhaps more recently , it could be very embarrassing for those who harbored him or otherwise aided him .
