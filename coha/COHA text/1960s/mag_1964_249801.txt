A great ecclesiastical manhunt has been under way for a successor to the Rev. Willem Visser ' t Hooft , the first and only General Secretary of the World Council of Churches . Tempers have become slightly frayed during the search - as was demonstrated last week when the Christian Century published a letter from 16 ecumenists protesting the way that the Rev. Patrick C. Rodger , 43 , was nominated for the job by the World Council 's 14-man executive committee . <P> Tempest in a Chalice . On the surface , the demure public battle over the nomination appeared to be a tempest in a chalice . The Century letter charged that the executive committee had made its choice public before consulting the council 's 209 member churches , and that news releases made it seem as if there were to be no rival nominations to Rodger 's , who will probably be accepted for the job by the 100-member central committee at its annual meeting next January in Enugu , Nigeria . <P> World Council officials argued that other nominations can still be made at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest of Scotland 's Episcopal Church who has been the executive secretary of the council 's Faith and Order Department since 1961 , was a plausible choice . A theologically minded German would have been anathema to the Orthodox churches . A representative of the " younger churches , " such as Bishop Lesslie Newbigin of the Church of South India , might be too identified with mission problems to please more established denominations . Many veteran ecumenists-U.S . Lutheran Frank lin Clark Fry , for example-have reached the age when they could serve only as interim secretary , are busy running their own churches , or have made too many enemies as well as friends in the course of building the council . <P> Theological Issue . The search for Visser ' t Hooft 's successor involves large theological questions as well as personalities . Within the ranks of professional ecumenists , there is considerable argument about whether the World Council is to be simply an administrative servant of the member churches or has " ecclesiological significance " as a budding superchurch . Within recent years , council membership has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pentecostals , that are jealous of their independence and theological traditions , and some are wary of seeing another forceful secretary replace Visser ' t Hooft when he retires . <P> The opposing argument is that ecumenism will dissipate its spiritual energies unless the council adopts a strong permanent executive . So far , there is no clear-cut alternative to Rodger . But Rodger 's opponents feel that the executive committee 's selection of a man relatively new to the council , whose main merit seems to be a lack of potential opposition , commits the council to a weakened secretariat-and to a theological position that has not yet been resolved by the member churches .
