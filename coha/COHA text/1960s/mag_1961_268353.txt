" I did not agree to take the editor 's job in order to liquidate the empire , " said lean , bespectacled Robert Fuoss , 48 . <P> The editorship he spoke of was that of the venerable ( 232 years ) Saturday Evening Post , which has been fighting a relentless slump since 1951 . The empire was Philadelphia 's Curtis Publishing Co. , which has anxiously watched the Post , its shining star , drop from first to seventh place in ad pages among U.S. magazines . The scene of Fuoss 's Churchillian remark was a bait-primed meeting of 150 Curtis ad salesmen and other representatives in tiny Pocono Manor ( pop . 300 ) in eastern Pennsylvania , where Fuoss revealed the details of a long , mysterious effort to restore the Post and Curtis . Said Fuoss : " We are battling for our corporate lives . " <P> Before and after the Pocono meeting , Fuoss and Art Editor Kenneth Stuart worked feverishly behind closed doors to change the fusty , predictable old Post into a snappier magazine with " impact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been " bankrupt in spirit and resourcefulness " when he and outgoing Editor Ben Hibbs gave it its last face lifting in 1942-and that he did not intend to let that happen again . The Post , said he , " is in trouble not because it is a poor magazine , but because we have somehow failed to adjust to the savage competitive environment in which we live . " With that , Fuoss sent Post pitchmen to advertising and sales offices across the U.S. with examples of the new format and with an admonition : " This is not a battle to be won by editors alone . You salesmen bring home the bucks . " <P> To help attract the bucks , the new Post promises to : <P> Wake up its readers with hard-hitting articles that Postmen wryly call " the Saturday Evening Punch " or simply " The Blast , " and a regular piece called " Speaking Out : The Voice of Dissent , " aimed at kicking up controversies . <P> Use more striking covers ( the word Post will be played across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Post ) , more photographs and designs showing " physical action " and aimed at stirring " emotional response . " One survivor : Norman Rockwell , Post sentimental cover artist for 45 years . <P> <P> Chuck its longtime Republican politics . " I do n't think the Post ought to be identified with any party , " says Fuoss , who has voted for both parties . " If I had been editor last fall , the Post would have been for John F. Kennedy . If I had been editor earlier this year , the Post would have lathered Kennedy for his sponsorship of the Cuban disaster . " <P> Use men in the fields of theater , architecture and record-jacket design to create splashy , arresting spreads and search for both bigger name fiction writers and promising unknowns in the U.S. and Europe . Probable fatalities : the most cloying fiction , the boy-clinching-girl illustrations .
