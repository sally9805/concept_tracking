The Organization Man in the Lonely Crowd that makes up the Affluent Society is also known , among some religion writers , under another capital-lettered phrase : he is Post-Christian Man . In the latest issue of the quarterly Theology Today , two Protestant theologians debate how fairly and accurately the term post-Christianity describes the times . <P> To Presbyterian Bruce Morgan , professor of religion at Amherst College , the age is truly post-Christian ; those who dismiss it as just one among many periods of history dominated by nonbelievers " fail to see the uniqueness of our time . " He doubts the contention of Harvard 's Paul Tillich ( TIME cover , March 16 , 1959 ) that ordinary men , beneath their daily concerns , are still haunted by the " ultimate questions " that lead to the Christian answer : God . <P> <P> He wonders , at least , " how accurately this describes the ' welladjusted mid-twentieth century man , beautifully trained to a high level of mass consumption . This man is extremely difficult to describe as one who finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death tends to become a technical matter , representing more the struggle between the physician and the mortician than between life and death . He is anxious , disquieted and often desperate , but his anxieties seem oriented around his professional and social status , his sexual relations , and the dislocations of a revolutionary world . " <P> The Missing Bedrock . Morgan concedes that there have always been skeptics . But in the past , there always " remained a substratum of theologically integrated assumptions to which reference could be meaningfully made " : monotheism , moral order , afterlife , sin . But modern man has rejected the assumptions , and even when he goes to church , he is deeply infected by doubt . He knows that " for millennia his ancestors lived in an era with other bedrock assumptions than his own , an era which can be called Hebrew-Christian. " but modern man " no longer lives in that era , and what is more , he no longer wants to . " <P> Christians , says Morgan , must ask themselves what is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discover how to speak and act in a time which assumes that God is dead . " But we will surely not learn or be taught if we operate on the assumption that our extremity is less severe than in fact it is . " <P> The Secular Mood . Presbyterian Charles West , who teaches Christian ethics at Princeton Theological Seminary , argues that Morgan has improperly defined the age : it is more post-ideology than post-Christian . " It is not just theologically integrated Christian assumptions which are being questioned by the modern secular mood , but all religions , and even all ideological attempts to give meaning to reality as a whole and man 's destiny In it . Salvation by Psychoanalysis , Communism and Existentialism are all fighting the same battle for survival today alongside the remnants of the corpus christianum against the postreligious world .
