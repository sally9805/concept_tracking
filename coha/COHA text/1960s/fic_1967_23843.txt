The first time I met Gloria Bunshaft I thought her nothing to write home about , an opinion that several years of marriage to her have done little to modify . It was at a college tea at which a portrait of the late Dean Wicker was unveiled . " It 's very lifelike , " she said to me . " Which is more than he ever was , " I answered . She turned on her heel and walked away . Women are of course notorious for taking everything personally , but there is usually some clue as to what offends them , so that one can decide what to reply , or whether to , since one 's rejoinder may be something to which further exception is taken , and so on . Then the whole thing becomes hopelessly self-perpetuating , like sneezing into a handkerchief to which one is allergic , A man might establish a ceiling on the obscurity with which he is prepared to cope from a woman , something like the present Administration 's guidelines for avoiding another ruinous wage-price spiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farfetched as on first blush they might seem , since life is a continual transaction and we are dealing here with the two great pressure groups of our time : men and women . It must be obvious on the face of it that women cause half the trouble in this world . I could say that Miss Bunshaft struck me as a dumb blonde , her raven tresses to the contrary notwithstanding , a mere technical quibble , but I hope I am not so malicious as to have thoughts like that crossing my mind . Still , there it is . She had just read the New Testament and loved it . And so on . The impression of imbecility arose in part from her somewhat girlish diction , always charming in its way of course ? " million dollars " became , on those rosy lips . " miwyun dowers " ? and by her habit of putting " urn " in front of everything . " I was born in urn Cleveland , " she would say , as though even so rudimentary a fact as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed before stated . Well , she was in any case not dumb from the neck down , as I observed watching her talk to somebody across the room , the library of the home of the president of Wilton College , where the unveiling occurred . I am supposed to be a critic , and so  --  I liked parts of her very much . She had graduated from Wilton a couple of years before , and now worked in the alumni office . I was a psychology instructor pushing thirty . So that when I call myself a critic I mean in the larger sense , as a student of the passing scene . Old Protheroe , the artist , shuffled over for a compliment , holding onto his coat lapels for dear life . " It 's very lifelike , " I said . He shuffled of again with his beagle eyes downcast , like a dog that has been scolded for some lapse of behavior . Such horror of the facsimile has latter-day art bred into us that even blatant practitioners of it cringe in fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the oil had values transcending the subject it would outlive . Well , I had no intention of doing so . We would all one day be regaled by Sandwich 's imitation of Protheroe 's " plantation shuffle . " " Where you all want dis ole Caucasian to put dese bags ? " he would say , and then Gloria would roar . All that was in the cards . But that was an exasperation I would have to earn , and so the road leading to it , yet to be traversed , must be described . Free of the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant darky , who lived alone above a store and was said to eat his supper straight out of cans , and finding Miss Bunshaft also unoccupied , I stepped swiftly over to her side . " 1 know that urn representation is out of fashion these days , " she said when asked why she had huffed off , " but if you ca n't have it in portrait painting where can you ? Not that I would n't defend it in general , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone is always knocking um verisimilitude . The abstract expressionists pooh-pooh art that copies nature . Well , they 're worse . They copy each other . " In one of those flashes of insight by which we divine truths we have not been told , I knew she had a mother who said , " Believe you me , " and would herself one day come to it . " That 's not what I meant , " says I. " I was n't pooh-poohing verisimilitude or anything of that sort at all . I ca n't for the life of me see why you took it that way . " " It was n't the remark as such . I suppose I was thinking of what you stand for on campus . The intellectual approach to everything . I was never in any of your classes , but you 're known for that . You 're brilliant , penetrating ? You do n't mind this criticism ? " " Not in the least . Fire away . " " You have minds like steel traps , men of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnat 's eyebrow , but there 's something missing . " " Heart . " She set her teacup down on a table and stalked out of the house . Through two open doorways I saw her descend the winding stairway to the entrance hall . I hesitated for a split second , remembering that I had been hearing such strictures all my life . My cortical sheath was a quarter-inch thicker than everyone else 's , and perhaps I should mend my ways . So lacking in flamboyance was I that even my entrails did not meander this way and that , like other people 's , but lay neatly coiled inside me , like a firehose . Now was my chance to change all that ? perhaps my last . My fate trembled in the balance . I watched her sink from view , like a swimmer drowning in the scenes-from-Williamsburg wallpaper covering the walls , then set my own cup aside and flew down the stairs after her . Thus began my pursuit of Gloria Bunshaft . What adventures she promised I liked them with spirit in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million . Passionate in daily life , reasonable in divorce . That is important these days . I have had several married friends , and I know divorce can be hell with the wrong woman . It was a good block before I overtook her , and then nearly another before I managed to coax her into a tavern . There over a drink she explained in greater detail her objection to " men of my ilk . " It was not the predominance of intellect over emotion as much as the want of emotion itself , especially the feeling that makes attachment to another person possible . We were islands to ourselves , us guys . My being unmarried at my age made me suspect here . " How can I put it ? " She paused a moment , groping for a parallel , and at length indicated the shirt I was wearing . It was bleeding Madras , a fabric to which men like myself were significantly enough given , for the term meant that the material " bled " when it came in contact with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at the collar would reveal precisely such an instruction . That was our isolation and our shame : in the rough-and-tumble of the general human laundry , we tended to run . " That 's an interesting comparison , " I said , " but a trifle cerebral for me . " She drank off her beer and stalked out of the tavern . She later said I exaggerated this particular exit , insisting that having finished her drink she was ready to leave anyway , having another engagement , and that only the very urn narcissistic sensitivity against which she had been inveighing had made me think her miffed by another of my " dry A member of " The New Yorker " staff since 1944 , Peter De Vries is well known for his satiric stories , poems , and such novels as " The Tunnel of Love " and " Reuben , Reuben . " " Nothing to Write Home About " will be included . in his new book , " The Vale of Laughter , " to be published this fall by Little , Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katie Louchheim We hang up the year , a conversation piece to take up space in the elegant pause before the plates are carried away . I keep my Ron fed on columnists : he 'll go home yawning . trading lies and anecdotes , deploring the rude ways of truth . We talk of headlines , of the tragedies befallen others , grieving aloud , we secretly discover the wine of the spared tastes suddenly sweeter . We measure out a proper sip of sighs ; in the candles ' flicker of bad news life stocks go up . It is like history : small talk is useless , it has to ripen . Why ca n't we admit the cure for loneliness is solitude ? The peripheral patter of these social whores is a leafless tree grown in the barren garden of pride . Reflected in your eyes my careful skepticism . Do be gracious . Light my sick cigarette . We will soon rise . We are most fortunate . This . too . we 'll forget . rejoinders . " All this over the telephone when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her again , suggesting dinner the next evening . She said she had another engagement . It all sounded military enough  --  these endless engagements of hers . We made it for the following Sunday . " It would never work , " she said , staring thoughtfully into space . " We would he at one another 's throats in a year , give or take a month , " I said . Without my reading glasses I could see the blood vessel throbbing in her throat . So I sensed a mounting excitement here , a kind of onrushing , nervous rapport such as can be generated between two people when utter agreement is felt on some score . We talked far into the night . It developed that her mother was a Lucy Stoner , refusing to become a subclassification of the male by taking his name in marriage , and insisting on retaining her own in line with the teachings of that aggressively feminist sect . To this day Gloria 's father must introduce his wife as Miss Cockenoe  --  a name anti-aphrodisiac to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , " I said . " I believe in two people having their own urn individuality . " Her speech habits were deucedly infectious , and I fur my part could imagine us murmuring these urns into downy , drawn-up covers far , far into the night . " That 's one thing that 's sacred . Individuality . " " There you have your bleeding-Madras point of view again , " she said . " Individuality is not number one with me , nor with God either . The Pair is . Communion . The Pair is the supreme reality . " " So if you want to communicate , keep talking . But if you want to commune , baby , shut up , " I thought to myself thought I. We were up at her place . I sat in a chair in the center of the room while she circled me steadily , airing her views . I had the feeling I was being picketed . Sometimes I would twist around to keep her in view over my shoulder , half expecting to see her carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . " That 's the danger we 're in , the danger of playing it safe , " she said , in a phrase obviously cribbed from somewhere . " The only risk worth taking is the risk of personal commitment . " She paused directly in front of me , and for a charming moment stood with her hands behind her back , like a child who has recited commendably . How could my heart not go out to her ? There are times when , sick of the rack of thought , weary of considerations as the poet puts it , a man would like to shut off the machinery of his mind and hurl himself into the arms of a dumb blonde , with hair of whatever denomination . When a man finds himself praying , " Send me a dumb broad . " She is an archetype , almost a folk goddess , like the earth mother herself , perennially appealing to something in our deepest nature because she fulfills an irresistible need . I could have dropped to my knees and embraced her then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly did so , but she began to picket me again . I ca n't report an unqualified ecstasy at the prospect of marriage , but I did experience in the days that followed an incessant , tingling hum of excitement , nervous , chaotic , like the inebriating jumble of an orchestra tuning up , often so much more exhilarating than the selections that they will play . Since I intended to take a wife , I thought it no more than fair to communicate my decision to the one most likely to be affected by it : my mother . Mother now lived in the tiny cottage on the outskirts of town to which she had been reduced when Father died some years before . We 'd had a large , rambling house that Mother filled to overflowing with vacation mementos , to say nothing of the grounds . The souvenir lamps and pillows and sugar bowls , the cabinets crammed with rocks and shells and other resort curios from nearly every state in the union , had their counterpart in the bird baths and silver bails and iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally indistinguishable from the wayside stands at which Mother had accumulated the gimcrackery that cluttered it , and so was this nne . Now Mother was not going anywhere ; she 'd been . She picked her way about with the aid of a stout cane , which she flourished militantly when not propping herself with it , so that she resembled those formidable beldames of the motion pictures who are depicted as forever summoning their lawyers in order to change their wills . Thickset and red-faced , she had both the build and the color for cutting people off without a penny . All that was lacking for the role was money . It was warm the day I called with my news , and she insisted we sit outside . As she picked her way toward the garden chairs beside the front porch , she poured out a customary torrent of complaint . Her eyesight was failing . She found herself swatting raisins on the kitchen table , thinking they were flies , and bringing her stick down on spiders that turned out to be scurrying tufts of lint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head noises . She imagined she heard drums beating . " And now there 's this rotten article in Life attacking marriage . " I was not very attentive , mulling over as I was the matter uppermost in my mind , namely my current academic project . As a psychology teacher I have become interested in that most tantalizing of all human phenomena . the wellsprings of laughter . Most theories of humor that have cut any ice have been propounded by philosophers , who must in turn range widely throughout literature on their explanatory forays , which means that I have developed a triangular distribution of interest , good for the mind but not for the career in this day of specialization . I may very well publish and perish both . I was at the moment trying to sweat out a synthesis of the Aristotelean , BergsonA story by Peter De Vries 71 ian , and Freudian hypotheses of laughter , by applying them simultaneously to one of the great episodes in English comedy . Yuu remember the classic scene in She Stoops to Conquer in which Marlow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public inn , and proceed to order him about . It is one of the funniest mistaken-identity sequences in literature , the result of a practical : joke played by Tony Lumpkin on his stepfather . No single theory has yet managed to explain all varieties of mirth . Nine-tenths of what we laugh at answers to Berg-son , another nine-tenths to Freud , still another to Kant or Plato , and so on , leaving always that elusive tenth that makes each definition like a woman trying to pack more into a girdle than it will legitimately hold . I do not mind admitting that my dream of glory is to fashion a girdle into which it can all be tucked . We were no more than settled in the garden chairs that each spring I hauled out of Mother 's cellar for her , and each autumn put away again , than she sent me back into the house for the magazine with the article that had got her goat . It was n't Life at all but some other periodical , and the title of the piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of little more than captioned scenes from a clutch of recent Broadway plays about sexual unions , the parties to which were depicted as belting and flaying one another as though everyone were Gunga Din . One housewife had both eyes blackened while another lay on a bed with a bloody nose , her blouse torn away . A current smash ( a good name for it ) was entitled A Bit of a Bitch , and dealt with a woman who rather enjoyed getting the knuckles of people 's fingers into a nutcracker and squeezing it shut . In the only actual lovemaking going on , the man 's head was bandaged . The general conclusion , implied or stated , was that the home must go . " Imagine anybody saying a thing like that , " my mother said . " Of course it 's not perfect . What human institution is ? But it 's the cornerstone of any civilization and , if it goes , everything goes . People should simply not go to see plays like that . " " There 's no danger that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get tickets . " " Where would the people who write such stuff be themselves if they had n't had fathers and mothers to raise them in homes they now denounce ? I wonder if they ever think of that . What alternatives do they offer ? Live in sin ? Wallow in the mire ? The beasts of the field mate with more pattern and dignity than that . Even wolves are monogamous . Of course the home must stay . Of course get married . " 72 NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT This seemed as good a time as any to break the news that I intended to do precisely that . Therefore after a murmur of agreement with her general position , and a brief pause , I said , " Mother , that brings me to something of my own I have to announce . I 'm going to get married . " " Married ! " She looked at me with startied eyes . clutching her breast . " You must he mad . You 're not serious , Wally . " " Never more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must be out of your mind . " I think I sensed what she meant . She feared being left alone in the world , an anxiety not only groundless but totally illogical in the circumstances . I no longer lived with her , I had my own digs now , and wherever else I moved to it would be just as close by . I tried to tell her all this , without much success . She had turned pale , and now slumped down in her chair . Her eyes fluttered shut , and then Mother began to slaver . Frightened half out of my wits , I galloped toward the house to phone a doctor . As I reached the porch I heard her call over , in the " loud , clear " voice with which we are continually told people make their last requests , " Get me some brandy . " I rushed into the kitchen where I knew she kept it , and out again , uncorking the bottle as I Ilew . She seemed to have pulled herself together somewhat , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth . She was still slavering a little . I planted myself squarely in front of her as she drank , for the cottage was on a fairly busy street and I wanted to shield Mother from passersby , a notoriously morbid class . Having taken several sips , coughing and spluttering like an engine once more starting up , she gave me the bottle back . " Pro all right now . It was just the shock , " she said . " You had n't told me you were going steady . Who is this girl ? What 's her name ? " " Gloria Bunshaft . " " You do n't know what you 're saying . When you say it will make no difference between us you 're wrong . It always does . Well , get rid of that , and then come back and tell me all about her . " I did , investing Gloria Bunshaft with qualities I was not such a fool as to imagine she possessed , bathing her in the rosy glow with which we must all obscure our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Romantic ardor is in basic principle Lethean . Its purpose is temporarily to blind us to one another in order to bind us to one another ; make us forget the low esteem in which we really hold one another , and in which we quite deserve to be held ; the anesthetic administered to A , 61 ' reason without which the race would not go on . Coming out of the anesthetic is never pleasant , and I quite appreciate the impulse to rush right out and make the same mistake over again with someone no better , and then someone else again  --  the system of serial polygamy toward which we seem to be groping  --  but in the end I tend to favor the Spartan policy exemplified by my parents , one dead and the other half-dead : to stick with what you 're stuck with .

When we see what is embraced in a railway station we know man wants but little here below . My only excuse for this rather depressing and I suppose sophomoric digression is the point I want to make ; in calling the woman I was going to marry nothing to write home about , I do n't want to appear to be considering myself anything better . Par from it . I might be a pill as a husband , as very possibly I already was as a son . Gloria could herself a tale unfold , but this is n't it . This is my story . And at the heart of it must clearly lie my central philosophy : guarded pessimism .
