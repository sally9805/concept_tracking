Only Boston could produce the peculiar blend of conservatism and boldness which has earned world-wide respect for its oldest hospital ? plus a few secret curses . IF YOU say MGH to any Boston taxi-driver he will head , without further questions , for the narrow streets back of Beacon Hill where a cluster of hospital buildings ? some century-old granite , others bright modern steel and glass ? sprawl along the Charles River Basin . Like the Common and Faneuil Hall the " General , " as it is known to its own people , is a local landmark . It is Boston 's past , present and ? very likely ? future . The same qualities that once made Boston sui generis have been preserved here ? a unique blend of conservatism coupled with bold assurance in which social , academic , and scientific freedom flourish . Chartered in 1E11 l , Massachusetts General was not the first voluntary hospital in America . ( Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia and New York Hospital in New York were earlier . ) Nor . with its 925 beds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best hospital in the country . But there are men and women all over the world who will contend fiercely that it is . Among them are some of the most gifted graduates of medical schools here and abroad . Quite typically , theroster of new interns last June included the top men from Johns Hopkins and Columbia 's P S and five of the first ten from Harvard Medical School . As many as forty-five different foreign countries are commonly represented among the physicians in training there . And the General 's patients come from the corners of the earth by plane , ship . and train . MGH has been , since its founding , a working partner of Harvard Medical School . However , unlike most university hospitals , which are dominated by the teaching institution , the relationship between this pair has always been one of equal collaboration . ( This is true also of Harvard and its other teaching hospitals ? Children 's , Peter Bent Brigham , Boston Lying-In , Beth Israel , Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary , and Free Hospital for Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been one of the great sources of the hospital 's strength enabling it to fulfill , in every sense , the mission laid down when it was chartered as " a receptacle for patients from all parts of the Commonwealth afflicted with diseases of a peculiar nature , requiring the most skillful treatment , and presenting cases for instruction in the study of surgery and physic . " Thus it is both a community hospital and a great teaching center . Respected and admired , the General is also envied and sometimes privately cursed for its assurance and independence . This happens when 61 NIGH raises its nurses ' pay , forcing other hospitals in the area to follow suit , or when the word spreads about the modest fees charged by renowned physicians and surgeons . Virtually every member of the General 's active staff has an appointment on the Harvard Medical School faculty . The two institutions share the salaries of all full-time doctors , who may also earn by private fees an amount equal to their salaries ? an arrangement which is policed only by a gentlemen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings , MGH has been steadily in the van of humane and scientific progress . Here in 1846 surgeon John Collins Warren operated in the first public demonstration of the effectiveness of ether anesthesia . Here , at the turn of the century , Dr. Richard Cabot and Miss Ida Cannon established the first medical social-service department in an American hospital . Here in 1930 a then-daring experiment was launched to help the widely forgotten " middle-income " patient . This is the 330-bed Baker Memorial unit which has both private and semi-private rooms for use today by people with incomes up to $12,500 . The unique feature of the Baker plan is the fact that doctors ' charges are strictly limited . There are four ceilings , according to income ? $250 , $375 , $500 , $650 . ( This must cover the charges of all doctors , including the surgeon and any others who see the patient in the hospital . ) It is , not surprisingly , one of the most sought-after services in Boston . Also not surprisingly , there were mutterings and protests from organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its freedom to look toward the future stems , in a specially Bostonian way , from its firm roots in the past . Current guardians of its proud tradition are the trustees , lineal descendants of those " opulent and charitable citizens of Boston " who were its incorporators in 1811 . They are a remarkable group . THE BOLD BRAHMINS I N BOSTON , as in most American communities , a hospital trusteeship is a badge of distinction , and the MGH Board is as much respected as the Harvard Corporation . Though at times the two directorates interlock , there is competition on State and Federal Streets about which board has invested its awesome endowment more shrewdly . Four MGH trustees are named by the Governor of Massachusetts , in part because the Common.wealth contributed funds and the services of convicts to cut the granite for the original building . ( It was designed by Charles Bulfinch , architect of the Massachusetts State House and Faneuil Hall . ) The board still includes an Adams , a Lowell , and a Lawrence . One member resigned after eighteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The " newer Boston " is represented by an Irish Monsignor and a leading Jewish philanthropist . The board ? eleven men and one woman ? meet on alternate Fridays ( or oftener if necessary ) from September through June , in a somber oval room paneled in rubbed mahogany and adorned with portraits of the founders , three of them by Gilbert Stuart . Punctually , as a tall clock strikes nine , the chairman , Francis Gray , Boston banker , raps for order . The agenda consist of reports carefully prepared between meetings by subcommittees working with staff and other experts . When action is taken it is neatly always by unanimous agreement . Money is , of course , a major board responsibility . Last year the budget was $17.5 million . Like hospitals everywhere , MGH is grappling with mounting costs and community complaints about rising charges . " it 's outrageous , " one angry ex-patient wrote . " I 've just had a long stay in Baker at $27 a day and there was dust in the corners and 1 had to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The standard reply at MGH is that baby-sitters in Boston get $1 an hour . For round-the-clock care ? which is what the hospital gives ? that would be $24 a day , which is the present charge for ward care ( within memory it was only $2 ) . Charges to patients do not , at a teaching and research hospital , come close to covering costs . The annual deficit is a fact of life which the trustees face without wringing their hands over it . They arc careful but also imaginative and resourceful . Money comes to the hospital from all sorts of people and places . A Midwesterner , for instance , left a gift of $10,000 in gratitude for the care given his mother-in-law who was a private patient for four years ( and paid a bill of $79,000 in a day of much lower rates ) . An unexpected and unrestricted bequest of more than a million dollars was made in 1952 by Hetty Green 's daughter whose spiritual adviser had been an MGH patient . Last winter a former house officer , now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his inability to attend the annual MGH alumni reunion . However , the purse of private philanthropy no longer is bottomless and MGH , like other hosG2 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL pirals , today relies heavily on payments from Blue Cross and other insurance plans . But in any event , the trustees consider money a minor problem compared , for instance , to the resurgent staphylococcus , which is a major concern of hospitals everywhere . And they worry far less about deficits than they would if the hospital should stop getting ten applications for every internship . Under the national intern-matching system ( run by the country 's chief hospital and medical associations ) medical-school seniors list their preferences for hospitals in order of desirability and from these applicants the hospitals choose in order the interns they prefer . The two lists go to a center where they are run through an IBM machine to bring man and hospital together . The trustees carefully scrutinize the record of every intern offered to MGH under this system . For it is the board that appoints the 145 interns and residents . as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some two hundred clinical and research fellows . Like Harvard with its student admissions , the General tries to select some of its interns and residents from far afield , as a means of drawing in new strength and extending the hospital 's influence . Around 1910 , the late Dr. David Edsall , chief of the East Medical Service , who later was dean of the Harvard Medical School , began sending some of the brightest young MGH residents to study abroad . Many returned to win international reputations in medicine , surgery , and clinical research and to become great teachers of future generations of doctors . AURA FOR THE WELL-TO-DO T . E same sense of mission that pervades the hospital 's staff is shared by the trustees . Secure socially , financially , and intellectually , they can and often do ignore querulous objections and pursue their chosen course of action according to their own standards . As a group , their aura is one of dignified conservatism . They are , for example . extremely fond of Phillips House , the private pavilion built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discrimination , against the well-to-do . Elegantly patterned after the rather gloomy Back Bay residences of its early clientele , Phillips House has high ceilings , big , deeply-recessed windows , and in the corner rooms fireplaces in good working order . Floors of the private washrooms are icy stone mosaic . There is a minimum of modern gadgetry ? elevators are slow and stately and if you want a nurse you press a button and wait without benefit of electronic intercommunication . Last year the board gave its cautious blessing to a proposal to expand the private wing . " You may go ahead , " they told the administrators , " provided the new rooms have the look and Feel of Phillips House . " The trustees are by no means alone in their sense of tradition . For instance , a few years ago Miss Ruth Sleeper , the director of the school of nursing , decided it was time to modernize the student nurse uniform which dates back to 1873 . A doctor 's wife who is a Back Bay couturiere volunteered to do the re-styling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accepting only minor modification of length and neckline and sleeve , they unanimously preferred their black and white shepherd-checked gingham dresses , bibbed white aprons , and black shoes and stockings . Particularly sacrosanct is the fluted upside-down-pudding-dish organdy cap which identifies an NIGH nurse from Maine to Melbourne . Attached though they are to such symbols of a proud past , the people of MGH ? and particularly the trustees ? feel no need to conform to current custom , if their conscience dictates otherwise . Such an occasion occurred in 1950 when Dr. Nathaniel W. Faxon , the hospital 's administrator , was nearing retirement age . After canvassing the available local replacements , the trustees calmly took the most un-Bostonian step of going to New York to find a successor . The man they chose was Dr. Dean Clark , a physician who belongs to the advance guard of social medicine . Personable , energetic , strong-minded , and intellectual , he is a Minnesotan and a former U. S. Public Health Service doctor . When he was approached by a two-man MGH committee , representing trustees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance Plan in New York , a prepaid comprehensive health-care plan which conservative doctors consider almost as sinful as Britain 's socialized medicine . " Before we go any further , " Dr. Clark said when asked if he would consider the job , " I must tell you that I never ran any kind of hospital . " " Perfect , " said the committee . " And although I 've never been a fellow-traveler , all my friends consider me a radical . " " Great , " responded the Bostonians . Frances Burns . a writer for the Roston " Globe " who specializes in medicine , came to Boston from Oregon in 1920 . She has two sons . The rapport established in this first interview has persisted , and neither Dr. Clark nor the trustees have felt any need for a contract to cement their relationship . In fact Dr. Clark fits perfectly into the MGH tradition which includes a quiet pride in nonconformity . ( One of its most celebrated dissenters is distinguished Dr. James Howard Means , former chief of the medical service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most socio-rnedical questions over the past two decades . ) Like Harvard , MGH cherishes the freedom to hold one 's own beliefs , provided it is done with gentlemanly decorum , and provided , too , that it does not conflict with the institution 's basic commitment . This dedication pervades the whole hospital from chiefs of service and trustees to the youngest student nurse . The first obligation of the hospital ? all its people agree ? is to its patients . ' Their records fill several acres of filing cabinets ? well over a million have accumulated in the past twenty years . In these records is written the story of the General . In them , too , one can trace the tortuous upward climb of medical science in terms of the people it has healed or failed over more than a century . THE PATIENTS 0 N January 23 , 1822 , Francis Vanvactor , described in the record as a " black man aet . 60 " was " assisting in getting the wheel from off the axle of his cart loaded with ashes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the leg . " 1821 . He was delirious and suffering from a coin pound fracture when brought to the hospital where , eleven days after the accident , his leg was amputated . In another week the 8:00 A.M. report was " good night ? no opiate . " The next entry is " 10 o'clock ? dead . " On the dissecting table he was found to have had a half-dozen ailments including narrowed arteries and a damaged kidney ? any one of which might have killed him . In any event his chances were small of surviving the risks of surgery in the days before asepsis and anesthesia . For dramatic contrast , let us leap to December 1958 , when a Boston window washer whom I will call Bill Jones arrived by ambulance after a fall of three stories . He had suffered concussion , and in Emergency was found to have broken both thighs , a knee cap , an ankle , both wrists , and his jaw . A resident at once started intravenous fluids and took a blood sample for cross-matching in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in about one of every two hundred persons , but there was an adequate supply on hand . The senior doctor on duty in Emergency called X-ray , orthopedic consultants , a neurosurgeon , and a general surgeon . Within an hour Bill was in one of the main operating-rooms of the comparatively new and impressive White Building . He was placed under anesthesia which the neurosurgeon had pronounced safe despite the concussion . A team of four orthopedic surgeons ( three summoned from their private offices in Back Bay ) operated simultaneously on his anus and legs while a general surgeon explored for internal in64 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL juries . Meanwhile a resident was getting a special bed ready with slings , weights , and ropes to hold the more badly injured leg in suspension . In the weeks that followed , more surgery was needed to put his jaw back in alignment , a second operation was performed on one thigh , a urologist operated for kidney complications . A specialist from the Massachusetts Eve and Ear Infirmary next door was called in to treat eye trouble that developed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within ten weeks he was out of bed and able to get around with the aid of crutches and a walker . By spring he was well enough to take off in bathrobe and wheel chair on an unauthorized jaunt to some neighborhood bars with another ex-Marine . A nurse off duty unobtrusively pursued them and brought him back . " Patient left hospital without permission and returned two hours later , " his record chronicles . " Did n't retard his recovery a bit , " one staff doctor said with an amused tolerance which also is part of the healing art as practiced at NIGH . One can sense it in many a venerable record ? as , for instance , in the case of Fong Whang who was admitted December 29 , 1842 , with the simple identification " cannibal " after his name . He had been picked up floating in the China Sea by a clipper speeding to Boston . In port he was transferred to another ship to be returned to his homeland . But when a doctor approached him with a needle to vaccinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hay . Three days later he was found on the Chelsea beach across the harbor with both feet badly frozen . He was brought to the hospital where the doctors , instead of amputating , decided to treat him with the best conservative remedies at their command ? sodium chloride and water , magnesium sulfate , ipecac , camphor colchici , and elixir of opium . They fed him whiskey ? which he regurgitated ? broth , vegetables , and meat . No one could speak his language and Whang was a troublesome patient ? noisy and feverish , who once attacked a patient in the next bed and had to be watched constantly . Miraculously , his feet healed completely and his general health was recorded as " good " when he finally left the hospital where , as a public charge , he had received the best that the science of the day could offer . So have hundreds of thousands of patients who have followed him . Last Christmas Eve , for instance , the doors of ambulance and Emergency swung open and blue-coated police officers , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a stretcher and wheeled it into an examining-room . Under the blanket was a gray , unshaven old man in rumpled clothes , found sleeping it off in an abandoned tenement basement entrance . " One of the poor old bums from around the square , " said one of the attendants . " Yes , but we shoot people who say that , " replied the young doctor heatedly . " Clean or dirty , alcoholic or not , moral or amoral , they 're all people who come here . " This patient had been huddling outdoors in the New England winter for perhaps two days . His temperature was an unbelievable 72 degrees ? theoretically too low for life , ten degrees below the controlled freezing known as hypothermia that is used as anesthesia in some heart and brain surgery . With all the skills in their arsenal , the young doctors fought for this life . Gradually they warmed the body with blankets and moist cum- presses . They stayed on the job around the clock . Though it proved impossible to save his legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probabilities . Cases such as this afford , of course , a. unique opportunity to teach and learn . But no MGH doctor is allowed to think of human beings merely as " clinical material . " " We all owe so much to the patient , " said Dr. Waiter Bauer , chief of medicine , " for the hundreds of years he has sat collectively on the benches of clinics , waiting ? for what he has taught us . " And of course , what has been so learned , adds up to what is known as medical progress . MEDICAL PIONEERING M A N Y of the hospital 's contributions to medical science had their beginnings in Ward IV , which Dr. James Howard Means set up in 1925 as a joint research project with Harvard Medical School , dedicated to investigation ? by patients and doctors ? of unsolved medical problems . The ward is located in a venerable building . Bulfinch , with grubby-looking laboratories tucked away in odd corners and crannies . " Thank God , " observed a visiting Englishman to Dr. Means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does n't stink of money ? " MGH , for instance , Dr. Joseph C. Aub with the late great physiologist , Dr. Walter Cannon , made major strides in combating a serious industrial hazard of workers in paint factories . More recently , Mrs. Thomas Edward Clarisse of Gulfport was admitted to Ward IV . For twelve years she had been suffering from a rare form of adult rickets which cost her ten inches in height and was growing progressively worse . For six months on Ward IV she lived on steamed chicken and meatballs ; everything she ate , drank , and excreted was measured and analyzed . Heroic doses of phosphorus finally arrested the disease , which now is known by her name in medical literature . There are only ten beds in Ward IV , which is dedicated primarily to the study of metabolic disorders . Elsewhere in the hospital , teaching and re . search are part of the day 's work along with the care of the sick . There is , for instance , the cardiac clinic founded soon after the turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the bright young men of MGH . Today the clinic is directed by one of his gifted students , Dr. Edward F. Bland , and doctors come from everywhere to take the intensive eight-months postgraduate course in cardiology which the clinic offers . There are heart clinics all over the world that include men trained at the General . From this clinic came awareness of the importance of recognizing and classifying the different types of heart disease and tailoring specific treatment for each . As a result of studies here , too , the first successful operation for the removal of a constricting pericardium , or heart covering , was performed by Dr. Edward D. Churchill , now chief of surgical services and Homans professor at Harvard . It might be said to be the forerunner of all today 's great heart surgery . The patient herself , still followed in the clinic , is a grandmother now . Clinical innovations may be developed almost anywhere in a hospital whose staff are research-and teaching-minded . One such occasion was the horrible Cocoanut Grove fire of 1942 , when 114 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun within ten minutes and the innovations ? horn of the urgency of the disaster -- resulted in a new treatment for burns which was subsequently adopted by the Armed Forces . This consisted of no cutting away of tissue , no cleansing , a bland ointment with protective dressing , and internally administered chemotherapy . ( In the years since the treatment has been further modified . ) The strides of modern science ? and the new interdependence of medicine , chemistry , physics , and physiology ? have enormously increased the cost and complexity of medical research . At MGH research ? both clinical and basic ? costs around $3.5 million a year . Under study may he the regeneration of a rat 's liver or the rapid but controlled growth of antlers in a fundamental comparison of normal and cancer cells ; the structure of living bone ; the relationship of chemical balance to growth ; the use of radioactive chemicals to pinpoint brain tumors ; the host response factors to rheumatoid arthritis . A great medical center affords the opportunity for collaboration between the many kinds of specialists which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hospital 's research committee , cites the team work in a revised method for the treatment of Parkinsonism with a beam of protons from IIarvard 's 154-million-volt cyclotron . A hospital neurologist evaluates the patient and his disease to choose a suitable candidate . The psychologist makes sure that the patient has a reserve of cerebral func66 MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL tion to insure that his memory and thinking will not be unduly limited by the treatment . The neurosurgeon decides on the precise zone of destruction by the proton beam in the brain ; and a Harvard physicist determines the voltage to be used . THE SECRET T EACHERS and researchers though they may be , the men of MGH are above all doctors . " Our young residents are tremendous clinicians , " said one administrator proudly . " They bring to the patient incisive decision and the wonderful enthusiasm of youth . They stay with the impossible . They give unstintingly of themselves . They arc on their feet sometimes for twenty-four to forty-eight consecutive hours and do many things far beyond the call of duty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attest ? I among them . Not long ago , as a patient , I went through the physical and emotional experience of an illness that could have led to death or crippling . Before that 1 had come to know the NIGH perhaps as well as any outsider may , for I had covered the hospital and its achievements for fourteen years as a medical reporter on the Boston Globe . But it was not , I think , until I was myself so deeply involved that I began to fathom fully what it takes to make a great hospital . It was Christmas Eve in Phillips House . I could hear the sound of the elevator carrying a private patient , perhaps with valet or maid bearing a suitcase filled with fine sheets and a silk coverlet . On the hard benches in the lobby of White , shabby men and women would he waiting and staring at the glittering blue fruit espaliered against the walls For Christmas by the Ladies Committee . In the eerie world of twenty surgeries , doctors still were operating . There was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red doors of Emergency . Phillips House was quiet . Outside across Charles Street there was ice in the river running black and cold to the dam . A single lighted tree stood in the center of the court on the other side of the pavilion . Save for the shadowed light at the nurse 's station the place might have been deserted . I thought of the doctors who had dropped by earlier in the day . " Stop being sorry for yourself , " said one surgeon , an old friend . " Think of the poor woman whose jaw I just took off . " " There is a banker going around with a hole in his head , " another surgeon commented . " flit it on the door frame as he got out of a taxi and a big clot formed under the skull ? he 'd have died in a few hours if someone had n't happened to look for it . As it is he 's good as ever . . . . " Through the door into the corridor from the stairwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procession of student nurses , glowing at the end of a long day , each carrying a single lighted candle . " Deck the hall with boughs of holly , fa la la la . . . " sang the clear lovely young voices as the girls passed swiftly down the hail , then back to the stairs . " No more , " said the floor nurse as I listened wistfully to the voices die away . " There are patients who came in for operations now to escape the fuss of Christmas . We 'd hear from them . " The quiet settled in again . Then in spite of the " No Visitors " sign , one of the house officers I had known before he entered medical school walked in , sank wearily into a chair , and lit a cigarette , He was still in whites . " What can society do about this sickness ? " he asked . " I 've just sent a fish cutter home from the wards . He 's been in for his third heart attack . He has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used up everything he had . His wife has been coming in and making scenes because she feels lost and insecure with the few hundreds they 'd saved bit by bit all gone now . I do n't know what he 'll do . I do n't know what 1 can do . But 1 feel responsible for him . " Now , as then , I can not provide the answer . But surely it will one day come from those with the wisdom and dedication to perceive the full dimension of their responsibility . In this awareness perhaps lies the secret of the great institution that is MGH.
