The Oberleutnant stares grimly at his wristwatch as machine-gun bullets twang overhead . A flare picks out highlights on the jackboots and bayonets of his - waiting assault troops . Then , with a wave of his Luger : " Vorwrts ! " But the troops have been staring at their watches , too . Instead of charging , they march off-out of step-toward the canteen . " It 's coffee-break time , " says the squad leader to the Oberleutnant . " Take it up with the shop steward . " <P> Soldiers in labor unions ? The very idea would be enough to set Clausewitz cackling in his grave . Yet last week unionization of the West German army was proceeding apace-with the approval of both Bonn and the Bundeswehr . At a meeting with West German labor leaders in Baden this month , Army Inspector General Josef Moll put his blessing on the union . " My presence , " he declared , " proves to you that we generals recognize the constitutional right of soldiers to organize in labor unions . " <P> P.S.T. &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in German history . Ever since 1713 , when Frederick William I forged the Prussian army into " a state within a state , " the German military has looked harshly on labor . Army bayonets cut down the demonstrating workers in 1848 ; army rifle butts broke strikes in the years that followed . Even after the defeat of World War II , German officers retained their antilabor sentiment , labeled union organizing efforts " contradictory to the principle of command and obedience . " In August , Christian Democratic Defense Minister Kai-Uwe von Hassel knuckled under to labor pressure and permitted the Public Service , Transport and Traffic Workers Union ( Soldiers Section ) to begin recruiting in Bundeswehr barracks . That caused two top generals to resign ( TIME , Sept. 2 ) and widened the fissure in the C.D.U . <P> Today , some 3,500 of West Germany 's 438,000 officers and enlisted men-including four generals-are dues-paying members of the soldiers ' union . By 1968 , the P.S.T. &; T.W.U. ( S.S. ) expects to have as many as 15,000 members on its roster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What can the union do for the Soldaten ? " We demand better pay , " snaps Union Leader Willi Zimmermann , 48 . He explains that a German sergeant with five years ' service draws only $150 a month ( v. $270 for his U.S. counterpart ) , and is seeking $40 a month more . Zimmermann also demands " easier " promotion , more recreational facilities , increased health coverage , and a pension plan equivalent to that of civil servants . Fair enough within the framework of current union de mands , but Zimmermann goes further . " It is ridiculous , " he says , " for a highly trained soldier to perform menial tasks like guard duty .
