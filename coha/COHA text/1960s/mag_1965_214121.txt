ABC Vice President James Hagerty , who found many a fault with reporters during the years he was President Eisenhower 's press secretary , ticked off some new grievances last week . Speaking before the New York State Broadcasters Association in Albany , N.Y. , he charged that TV newscasters either " overdo it or lose themselves in a mass of electronic hodgepodge . " Recalling all the endless fuss the press made over Ike 's illnesses , Hagerty asked whether it was worthwhile , when President Johnson caught the flu , to " flood the air with special programs and breathless bulletins that could n't help but give the impression that his life was at stake , when actually it was n't any more than many of us had who contracted the same bug . " <P> Bulletins in general , Hagerty complained , are overdone : " We are at war in Viet Nam , and the international situation is serious but not disastrous . Radio and television reach every citizen of our nation ; and when we interrupt regularly scheduled programs with a bulletin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few beats until they hear the bulletin . Unless it is a matter of vital importance , are n't we running the risk of crying wolf too many times , with the resultant loss of public confidence ? " <P> Just as bad , said Hagerty , is the quality of TV interviews : " I do n't know anyone in the industry who has n't been embarrassed from time to time by the disgraceful and frenzied interviews of public figures that are put on the air . Hordes of radio and television reporters , augmented by photographers and reporters of the newspapers , literally swamp the person being interviewed . Hand-carried microphones are thrust into his face from all directions ; he is often half-blinded by the television lights ; questions are shouted at him simultaneously from two or three reporters . All too often everybody gets the same treatment-be he a high-ranking Government official , a visiting foreign dignitary , an athlete , a hardened criminal , a juvenile delinquent or a Christine Keeler . <P> " Only the other day , the wife of Malcolm X had several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did you feel when your husband was assassinated ? ' How in God 's name would anyone think she felt ? Incidentally , I thought her dignified answer made her look ten feet tall and the questioners very small indeed . "
