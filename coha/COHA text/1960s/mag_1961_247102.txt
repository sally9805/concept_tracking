His sherry cabinet in Harvard Yard long since turned over to another president , his diplomat 's striped pants put into mothballs , the quiet New Englander embarked on a new career-unofficial Inspector General of U.S. Education . Dr. James Bryant Conant toured high schools , investigated curriculums and teachers , and in 1959 mildly concluded that the U.S. high school could be improved " with no radical change . " But then Conant got around to taking a look at slum education . His report , Slums and Suburbs ( McGraw-Hill ; $3.95 ) , published last week , shows how incensed a former Harvard president can get . <P> In the typical Negro slum , Conant found , one-third of all children come from families in which there is neither father nor stepfather . Almost all their homes lack books and newspapers . Young girls say that their " biggest problem " is to get home without being molested by men . Teachers struggle " tenaciously and bravely " against the adversities of home and street , but bow before the realities . They assign no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenements . They teach no foreign languages in junior high school because half of their pupils hardly know English-they read at sixth-grade level or below . Their immediate task is to prod sleeping children who have been kept awake all night by battling parents . And they struggle steadily to keep their charges from quitting school , to keep them from joining the unemployed floaters on the street . <P> Within these limitations , slum teachers score remarkable successes . They do manage to bring some order to otherwise chaotic lives . Says Conant : " The outward manifestations of discipline , order and formal dress are found to a greater degree in the well-run slum schools of a city than in the wealthier sections of the same city . " Yet in most big-city slums , more than half of the students drop out of school when they reach the legal age , usually 16 . Two-thirds of the dropouts fail to find jobs ; even among those who get high school diplomas , roughly half can not get work . The massive idleness of slum-dwelling men aged 16 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve slum schools , Conant asks : <P> &gt;More money . " The contrast in money spent per pupil in wealthy suburban and slum schools challenges the concept of equality of opportunity in American public education . The expenditure per pupil in the wealthy suburban school is as high as $1,000 per year . The expenditure in a big-city school is less than half that amount . " <P> <P> &gt; Upgraded vocational education so that students leaving school would have at least one marketable skill . New schools , copying the pattern of Chicago 's Dunbar Vocational High School , should be located in large metropolitan areas to teach such trades as bricklaying , carpentry and auto repairing . Otherwise vocational programs should be distributed among the general high schools , as is being done in Detroit . Slow learners might even be prepared for service occupations , such as bellboys , messengers and laundry drivers . <P> &gt;Schools should be given the responsibility for educational and vocational guidance of youths after they leave school , until the age of 21.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
