" We sailed The Columbus Ship " The incredible story of how nine men in a forty-two-foot boat braved wind and wave to re-create the first conquest of the Atlantic . By ROBERT MARX , as told to William R. Shelton It has been almost five centuries since Christopher Columbus set forth into the great unknown to discover a new world . The trip from the Canaries that took Columbus 36 days takes less than a week on a modern luxury liner , less than half a day on a jet . But despite all the centuries of change , which have turned oceans into lakes and discovery into commonplace , man still feels Adam 's need to know the unknown , to reach into the boundless mysteries that lie beyond himself . Even in the space age , however , this need drives men not only to explore the new but to rediscover the half-forgotten past . And so it was that nine men set out last summer on one of the strangest adventures of modern times . They were determined to conquer the Atlantic just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ship they sailed in was scarcely bigger than a suburban businessman 's weekend yacht . This 42-foot replica of Columbus 's Nina ( pronounced " Neen-yah " ) had no motor , no radio , no modern lifesavingequipment , no provisions except roughly the same as Columbus had carried . And its inexperienced crew soon ran into storms and hardships that might have made Columbus himself turn back . By the end of the 36th day , when the explorer had first sighted flickering lights at San Salvador in the Bahamas , the voyage of Nina II seemed to have ended in disaster . There were new bonfires lit in San Salvador , but Nina II was nowhere in sight . On November 24 , U.S. and British military planes began a search of the entire area . For six days they searched in vain . Then on the 30th a U.S. Navy P2V Neptune picked up a tiny radar blip 780 miles east of Puerto Rico . A few minutes later the pilot , Commander Vernon F. Anderson , sighted the tattered mainsail of what looked like a relic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the 15th century , " says Anderson . He air-dropped a radio and some fresh supplies . Three days later a Saturday Evening Post editorial and photographic team flew over Nina II in a Navy hurricane-hunter plane from Puerto Rico . Though virtually becalmed , the frail-looking craft had a genuine grandeur as she rose and fell on the gentle swells , her sails reaching out for every breath of wind . Over the air-dropped radio Nina 's only American crewman , Robert Marx , reported that the new explorers were determined to reach San Salvador " at all costs . " The same Post team returned to the scene I I days later aboard a motor vessel and boarded Nina ll to get Bob Marx 's own story of the voyage . Marx , a 29-year-old native of Pittsburgh who was the vessel 's pilot-navigator , is no stranger to adventure or to The Post . While a U.S. Marine at Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , he spent his spare time diving in the treacherous waters off Cape Hatteras until he located the long-lost hulk of the Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archaeologist , he spent years on Cozumel Island off Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula , recovering thousands of antiquities from one of the most important Spanish wrecks ever discovered ( The Saturday Evening Post , August 27 , 1960 ) . But all this was only a prelude to his epic adventure aboard Nina II . As an exact physical recreation of Columbus 's voyage of discovery it was a failure . But Marx and his eight comrades re-created something more important : the courage and determination that enabled Columbus to reach a new continent . THE EDITORS . W hat was it like to sail across the Atlantic in one of Columbus 's tiny ships ? I do n't know . But I do know that a similar expedition today is like this : It 's the sight of a black sky at noon and the sound of the wind rising and the knowledge that only a thin sheath of leaky wooden beams keeps you afloat over the surface of death . It 's the sickening feeling as Nina suddenly heels over more than 60 degrees , a wall of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the sails before the gale snaps the mainmast like a match . It 's the taste of brackish water , in smaller and smaller rations until there 's no water at all , the taste of food that gets so rotten that you finally eat it in the dark so you do n't have to look at it . It 's the taste of freshly caught shark  --  harpooned , roped and writhing , and then battered to death on the deck  --  when you know that scores of other sharks are on the other side of those leaky beams , waiting for you . It 's not all a nightmare , of course . It 's also the clean joy of a ship surging forward under sail , and the sound of your crewmates singing , and the sense that you 're close to a kind of truth you ca n't find on land . In my own case , I 'd been ashore in Spain for a number of months , and I was getting restless for adventure . Not just any adventure . It was the adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd read about them and I wanted to know more about what those voyages were really like . I had gone to Spain in hopes of building a replica of a Spanish galleon and sailing it to the New World . Word about the project must have spread , for I got a telephone call one day from a young naval lieutenant , Carlos Etayo Elizondo . He had taken a leave of absence to sail across the Atlantic in his own replica of Nina and asked whether I 'd be interested in joining him . By the time that telephone call ended I had abandoned my own project . When I first met Carlos in late June he was dressed in a slightly soiled white Navy uniform and appeared to have a rather casual air , but his dark eyes blazed with a contagious obsession to sail Nina II to America . Since 1957 , the 4I-yearold Carlos told me , he had devoted himself almost exclusively to the reconstruction of Niiia . After he received a modest inheritance he selected a shipyard in Pasajes , the seaport of San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nina II was laid in January of 1962 . The 42-foot ship was built of oak and pine from the Pyrenees , just as Columbus 's ships were , and held together with wooden pegs and wrought-iron spikes , all driven in by hand . Carlos invested every cent he had to make her authentic  --  more than 520,000 . On June 5 the workmen had ceremoniously launched the bare hull , and now they were building her masts and poop cabin . " Your galleon is still in your head , " Carlos said to me , " but my caravel is in the water . You are welcome to join forces with me . " He offered me the job of pilot-navigator , and I accepted without hesitation . I even went a step further . " Why not go exactly the way Columbus did , " I asked Carlos , " eat the same chow , wear the same clothing , use the same arms and navigate by the same methods ? " He said he had considered this but did n't believe it possible . He thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We argued about it all night , and he finally agreed to give it a try . My first job was to assemble costumes , cannon , swords and other authentic 15th-century gear for our voyage . Before setting sail , however , I had another assignment , unlike anything that Columbus 's lieutenants faced . Carlos had a suspicion that Americans were n't very brave , and he wanted to be sure of me . He wanted me to participate in the famous festival of the running of the hulls at Pamplona . All I had to do was to get out in front of the bulls in the sealed-off streets and race them to the ring . Without quite knowing what I was in for , I agreed . When the starting gun sounded and hundreds of youths began a stampede toward the ring , Carlos just stood still , and I had to stand with him . Carlos had participated in nearly every run since he was a child , and as the bulls approached he stood there as though he were calmly greeting friends . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the bulls roared down on us , Carlos yelled " Now ! " and we took off . I leaped for a window grille . It collapsed in my hands , and I fell back against the hindquarters of one bull . Then there were six more real daddies charging down on me . I ran at Olympic speed for about a mile until I finally scrambled over an eight-foot gate with the six bulls snorting at my heels . Carlos solemnly told me that he thought I had passed the test . So I was good enough for Nina . And when I finally got my first glimpse of her in Pasajes , she looked to me like the eighth wonder of the world . Though far from complete , she had a dignity about her that made her just beautiful . One of the final tasks of preparation was to find the right crew . What we most needed were authentic seamen . not adventurers . We were swamped with applications , even from females . One of the first authentic types we signed up was Jose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came from a long line of seafarers . After spending years as a commercial fisherman all over the world he had finally given up the sea in order to spend more time with his wife , but the lure of Nina 11 had been too great . Another authentic type was Nicolas Bedoya Castillo , a white-haired man of 69 with a face like cordovan leather . He suffered from rheumatism . but he had the wisdom of a lifetime at sea in the Spanish navy . Some of the others were not quite so authentic , but they were equally eager to join . There was Antonio Aguirre Oronoz . He was 42 , a harmonica player , a fisherman , a cook , a former professional boxer , strong as an ox . Then there were two carpenters who had helped build Nina . Neither of them had ever been to sea before . Finally , on July 28 , under the eyes of a curious crowd , we cast our moorings and set out into the sheltered hay to try our hands at the oars . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they barely reached the water . None of us was used to rowing or keeping a beat . Our oars banged against each other like swords in battle . And the incoming currents kept pushing us against the mudbanks . After a few hours our hands were raw and blistered , and we had barely moved Nina 300 yards . As we struggled back to the dock the spectators laughed and jeered at us . " And in this crate which we ca n't get out of port , " Jose said to me , " we are going to try to cross the Atlantic ? " Troubles holding a course Crazy as it seemed , that was just what we were going to do . Three days later with favorable winds , we hoisted our lateen sail and prepared to try our beautiful ship against the fierce Atlantic . It was almost a disaster . In defiance of every law of sailing as we knew it , our Nina could n't go 20 feet in a straight line . As we headed her out to sea , she insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To the oars ! " cried Carlos . And with our oars , which barely skimmed the water , we had to row at double time for more than an hour before we brought her back to safety . Both of our trusty carpenters were seasick , and one of them got so frantic that he fell into the hold and broke three ribs . Did Columbus have problems like this ? Perhaps . We retreated to port in nearby Guctaria to decide what should be done . The mizzenmast had to be reset and the rudder rebuilt bigger . And we needed two new crewmen to replace our two seasick carpenters , who just faded away once they got ashore . On August 12 we held our second sea trials . The extensive alterations had performed a miracle . Nina II held a reasonable course with both the square mainsail and lateen rig . We were the proudest men in Spain that night . There were a few other last-minute preparations , such as getting more crewmen . At Guetaria we signed aboard a handsome Frenchman , Michel Vialars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us , a trained veterinarian . Carlos also signed a priest , the Reverend Antonio Sagaseta , 46 , of Pamplona . Columbus had no priest aboard , but our padre had been an artillery officer and an engineer . The priest , in turn , brought aboard an ancient cat , which I named Chirche . Chirche , perhaps wisely , developed an immediate antipathy to Nina . She leaped into the water and swam ashore . Some kids tossed her back to us . For nearly an hour Chirche struggled to reach dry land , even crossing on the lines , but the kids kept tossing her back . Finally she gave up in exhaustion and settled mournfully down on deck . Our final preparations concerned food . We were determined to leave Guctaria with exactly the same provisions that Columbus had carried : biscuit , flour , lard , water , wine , vinegar , brandy , olive oil , almonds , raisins , cheese , sugar , salt , chick-peas , rice , garlic , onions , beans and sardines . Quite a menu . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when we tried to talk the crew into doing without tobacco , on the grounds that tobacco was unknown in Columbus 's time we learned that this was too much to ask . We compromised by asking them to light their smokes with the ancient flints I had obtained in Madrid . I know it sounds crazy , but it was that kind of trip . On August 23 a strong and favorable northwest wind , predicted to last 10 days , began off Spain 's western coast , Since our official voyage began out of Palos , where Columbus had departed from Spain 's southern coast , we consented to a two-day tow on the 24th to take us to the favorable winds . We estimated making the 950-mile leg to Palos in six days . That first night in heavy seas was a nightmare . Our caravel wandered behind our towboat like a crazed whale . Often we got so far sideways that we nearly capsized . Leathery old Bedoya exclaimed several times that all was lost . Our tiny lantern on the mast kept going out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of being run down by a freighter . The tiller pulled and tugged at us with such massive force that we were all soon covered with bumps and bruises . One minute at the helm was like five minutes on a bucking bronc . After three days ' struggle with Nina 1 had slept less than three hours and Carlos even less . None of is had time for a hot meal . By then we were supposed to reach the favorable winds . We dropped our tow and were on our own . But the wind unaccountably died on us , and we wallowed in lifeless seas . After six days we felt as if we had lived at sea for months . Our water , stored in uncleancd old wine kegs , was almost completely spoiled ; our bread looked as though it had turned to penicillin ; we were covered with cat fleas ; our cabin was damp and filthy . On September I I we finally reached Palos  --  tossed , buffeted , frightened , undernourished  --  and we had n't even started . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent many weeks here as guest of the Franciscan friars at La Rdbida Monastery . Could we do less ? It seemed only reasonable that we should have dinner at the monastery , lunch with the governor and parties and celebrations without end . We met many descendants of the men who had sailed with Columbus , and they regarded us as national heroes . We got our water from the same well that Columbus had used , heard Mass in the same church and received our food largely from the descendants of Columbus 's crew . We also picked up two new seamen . One was Manuel Darnaude Rojas-Marcos , whom we called Manolo , a 33-year-old soccer and spear-fishing buff . The other was Jose Robles , a comical man of 39 whom we called Pepe ( " Joe " ? , since we already had another Jose aboard . He joined us with only the clothes on his back and not a cent in his pocket . We lost another passenger  --  Chirche , who had finally made her way back to dry land . At sunrise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , passing La Rabida Monastery where the friars sang Gregorian chants . As we crossed the bar of the river , escorted by scores of yachts and fishing boats , buzzed by Spanish air-force planes , we knew we had finally begun our task of re-creating history . Our next stop  --  Columbus 's next stop  --  was the Canary Islands , 1,000 miles away . Our troubles began again almost immediately . For three days we had to light a wind that threatened to blow us into the Mediterranean . Then the winds died on us , and we sailed with all canvas spread . Around noon of our sixth day out we were all sitting on the quarterdeck eating our main meal of rice and beans and watching a school of porpoises playing around us . Suddenly the hot wind hit us , one of those sudden gusts that sweep off the North African desert . Our authentic wooden spoons and platters spilled all over the deck as Nina began heeling over to starboard , and we scrambled to hang onto masts and rigging . We could feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 45 , then 60 , with gusts of hot air raging even stronger . It all happened so quickly that we had no time to take in sail . The wind tugged and heaved at Nina until the ship heeled over almost on its side . Some of us hanging onto the port railing could see her keel knifing up out of the foaming water . Michel grabbed an ax to cut the mainmast , but I held him back . We did n't have to disable the ship ; we just had to get the sails down . The sky darkened ominously , and about every tenth wave washed completely over us . Jos ? , our best seaman , whom we sometimes called " the monkey , " scrambled out over the churning seas on the yard , adding his weight to our efforts . The rest of us grabbed knives and slashed the sheets that held in the mizzensail . The loose lines now flailed at us like whips . Then the mainsail suddenly ripped , spilling the air and taking some of the pressure off Nina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But our troubles were far from over . The fierce storm raged on for more than 30 hours . Despite our steadying storm sail and sea anchor Nina 's old symptoms began reappearing , and she kept turning broadside to the waves , tossing like a cork . The cabin filled with two feet of water , and everything was a shambles . A four-gallon ceramic jug of olive oil had broken , and the sides and roof of the cabin were as slick as grease . And now we discovered another major trouble . Nina , built with authentic timber from the Pyrenees and held together with hand-carved wooden pegs and handwrought iron spikes , leaked like an old washtub . For hours , we labored at the ship 's two crude hand pumps until our bilge water again reached a safe level . When the seas finally abated we went down to inspect the hold where our provisions were stored . The sight sickened us . Everything seemed destroyed . Jugs containing water , wine , vinegar and brandy were broken . Ceramic containers for rice , flour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-quarters of our water and half our food . As we went about repairing our sails we started the strict rationing that we maintained all the way to the Canaries . Perhaps we had learned a lesson : The sea can be most dangerous when she appears the most benign . Another casualty of the storm was symbolic  --  the destruction of the 15th-century hourglasses we used for navigation timing , as Columbus did . I now had to dig down in the damp hold for my automatic pocket watch . We knew we were lost that night as we spotted a light from Africa when we thought we were 200 miles from the coast . My navigation instruments were replicas of the 15th-century quadrants and astrolabes , while Carlos used a sextant . Often my positioning would match that of the sextant or come within one degree ( 60 miles ) of the sextant 's position . My pocket watch was useful in timing sunrises and sunsets , which helped us estimate longitude . As we limped along toward what we thought were the Canaries we gradually became somewhat more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and the weather was warmer . Michel and I occasionally took baths in the sea in an effort to eliminate some of the fragrance of the cramped cabin . On the days we did our washing Nina looked like a clothes . line on a blue Monday in Brooklyn . Since our bread baked in Palos had gone bad , I learned how to make a strange kind of tortilla out of unsifted flour , olive oil and sea water . They looked like mud cakes , but they tasted all right . For breakfast , and again at dinner , we usually had two tortillas , a sliver of raw onion and a thin slice of ham or cheese . Lunch was rice and beans or rice and lentils . On the third of October we finally reached the Canary Islands , and we surprised everyone by entering Las Palmas instead of Gomera , as Columbus had done . I discovered then that my watch was five minutes slow and our anticipated Canary landfall was 70 miles off . As the pilot boat came out for us we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beards . After all our hardships we had still scarcely begun our voyage . But again we underwent the sudden transformation from smelly , laboring seamen into celebrities . Thousands met us at the dock , including bevies of lovely European girls in bikinis . I think it is historically accurate to say Columbus never saw anything like this . Like ragpickers on a spree Our first treat was a hot bath ashore , then a 12-course meal in a fine restaurant . Nothing seemed too good for the crew of Nina , installed in the palatial Hotel Metropole . For some of our authentic crew this was the first luxury they had ever known , and we moved in like nine ragpickers among all the gorgeous gowns and dinner jackets . After this round of festivities Father Sagaseta said Mass for us in the same church where Columbus is believed to have heard Mass before his ocean crossing . Then we went to Nina to prepare her for sailing . I had located a young nanny goat which we named Pinzona , after a beautiful girl we had all met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Antonio the cook named her Linda , which means " pretty " in Spanish . From the beginning Linda 's soft eyes and playful ways made her the pride of the crew . We loved her . She had fleas , too , but her beauty more than compensated for her parasites . After dramatically firing our falconette ( a small cannon ) we tried to row out of the harbor authentically . But the wind was too much for us , and we embarrassedly accepted a tow . When our tow finally cast off , I think we were all relieved to be at sea again after our revelries ashore . Now we finally began our mission . Now we were reall ) setting out on Columbus 's course to the New World . We did not realize it then , but during the weeks ahead we would face more peril even thar Columbus on his voyage . The first problem was food and water . We be . gan with provisions that we estimated were gooc for roughly 50 days , but our estimates were part ; wishful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kegs we had taken on at Las Palmas were already leaking , and our fresh fruit was sure to rot quickly in the damp hold . To confirm my suspicions , a working party went below at the end of the first week and discovered that two faulty water barrels out of five had already leaked dry . That meant that we were starting with more than 40 percent of our water gone . Carlos ordered immediate rationing and asked that our 200 casks of wine be held in reserve , but our crew , long accustomed to wine , continued to drink it like rain water . On top of all this , we had sailed only 60 miles out of Las Palmas when we found that Nina was leaking again . To make it worse , one of our pumps had suction trouble . Our original plan was to sail due west , never dropping below the 24th Parallel of latitude . But for 14 days the prevailing northeasterly trades never materialized . Instead we had steady westerly winds and calms , combined with southbound currents . I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see we were being pushed steadily southward , even farther from San Salvador than when we began . But our main worry right from the beginning was our dwindling supply of food and water . Our fruit went quickly . After just five days at sea more than half our supply of melons , bananas , oranges and tomatoes had rotted so badly that we had to throw them over the side . Carlos even started drinking tiny amounts of sea water to test one possible survival measure . Michel , anticipating the worst , began to build plankton nets so that we could scoop up the tiny marine organisms and cat them . Old Bedoya revealed his own anxiety when he reminded me that we should n't throw the goatskin away when the time came to kill and eat the goat because we might eventually need to cat the skin . Such remarks made me wonder about Columbus and us . Which is worse  --  to know as we did that you have 3,000 miles to go and not enough food to get there , or to think that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going ? It 's a sort of philosophical question about the means and the end . Would you rather have an end without the means or the means without the end ' ? Do n't try to figure out the answer . There is n't any . The sea makes philosophers out of the simplest men , or vice versa . And then there were other problems that may not have bothered Columbus . It is hard , for example , fora 20th-century man to get rid of the idea that there ought to be some kind of sanitation , or whatever you want to call it . Sanitary facilities aboard our tiny craft consisted mainly of the briny sea . While hanging over the side one day , one of our crewmen looked down into the gaping jaws of a shark just inches below him . This understandably began a shark scare aboard Nina . It threatened to curtail the refreshing sea baths that Michel , I and a few others took during calms . This was a minor tragedy , for our tiny cabin smelled far worse than low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , had not taken a bath or changed his clothes for months . I could only entice the men into the water after diving beneath the hull myself to prove there were no sharks within range . IL was a risk , but I felt it was worth it . Fishing at first was deplorable . Once we saw some baby whales , and we often saw porpoise , sharks and flying fish , but we could n't get anything aboard . On the ninth day out Antonio did catch a three-pound yellowtail which had two squid in its stomach , plus three smaller yellowtails . Then on our 12th day out the padre suddenly shouted that we had a big one . We had hooked a 10-foot tiger shark , and it was full of fight . It was sheer mass confusion as Bedoya tried to lasso its tail , Antonio tried to harpoon it and Carlos tried to ax it . The goat bleated in terror , and Linda meowed loudly from the rigging . Even after we got the shark aboard , it thrashed about wildly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men with axes , 15th-century spears , harpoons and even sledgehammers , trying to subdue the monster . The shark snapped at the men 's legs . Everyone leaped madly about the deck . Then little Linda jumped right into the thick of it , expecting a meal , even balancing herself on the shark 's head while it was gnashing away at everything in sight . That night we polished off a bottle of rum , played the harmonica and then could n't sleep because or all the excitement . Our bit of luck with fresh meat came none too soon . The next day we discovered that our remaining salt meat was full of worms . We ate our shark meat with sea-water tortillas again , since our flour was already moldy and turning all colors of the rainbow . Several of us were now quenching our growing thirst by alternating small amounts of salt water with Spanish red wine . By the fourteenth day our remaining water was undrinkable . It had turned a horrible shade of brown ; it was full of living creatures and smelled worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all peaceful enough  --  a little dull and a little disgusting , but peaceful . Yet the primal force of the Atlantic Ocean , Columbus 's Atlantic , was never far from us . Sixteen days southward bound from the Canaries , the first really big storm struck just at sunset . It bent the mainmast out of its socket . Naia heeled far to port and stayed that way , taking on water with every wave . It was my turn to man the tiller , and this was a tug of war between a man and the powerful waves battering the rudder at the other end of a fragile length of ' timber . After one hour at the helm I could n't take it any more , and I collapsed exhausted on the floor . I dreamed that l was tied in the center of a tug-of-war rope with hundreds of people pulling at it from both ends . I dreamed that l had to resist desperately in both directions to keep from being pulled to pieces . Just as I was reviving , Niiiu suddenly heeled violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigation manuals came crashing down on my head . By the following morning the storm had abated slightly , but Ndia 's rudder was no longer functioning , and we were wallowing sickeningly in every swell . Pepe went down to inspect the hold and casually reported , " We arc leaking below , " That was n't all . Both our bilge pumps were useless . Constant wear had destroyed the suction . We had to start bailing . We formed a human chain leading up from the hold and passed up buckets and wooden bowls to keep the ship from sinking . And so it went for two days . The constant bailing was sapping our strength and making our thirst and hunger nearly unbearable . It was an endurance contest in which the stakes were our lives . Finally I decided to go over the side myself and try to patch the hull with crude caulking and wood plugs , as they had to do on the old Spanish galleons . I found the main hole , where a wooden peg had worked loose well below the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug for the hole i remembered the story about the Dutch boy and the dike . Like an idiot I put my thumb in the hole , gulping air occasionally as the ship rolled and my head came above water . Suddenly I was pulled deep under water . Then I realized I could n't get my thumb out . I grabbed my knife . For an instant 1 thought I might have to cut off my thumb . But Mita rolled in time for me to breathe again . Quickly I enlarged the hole with my knife . I finally extricated my swollen thumb and managed to insert a new wooden plug . But the storm had blown us southward , the wrong direction . And when the winds finally died we realized we were far off course and far behind a reasonably safo schedule , considering our water and food shortages . At first Carlos and I kept the precise record of our progress a secret from the men , as Columbus had done . But finally , as our rations dwindled , we felt we had to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which Columbus was already over half the distance to San Salvador , we were still wallowing along within insect range of the African coast . That night on deck we held a solemn ritual . First we opened a bottle of brandy , more in sadness than celebration . We all knew the serious implication of the decision we were about to make . Every one of us faced the possibility of death , and everyone had a right to help decide our course . Should we head for the nearest land for more food and water or should we continue our struggle to make San Salvador ? Each man aboard was given a piece of wood of about the same size . If he wanted to vote for San Salvador he was to throw the wood in the sea . If he wanted to vote to proceed to the nearest land he was to place the wood in the goat 's empty water dish . It was dark , and each man could vote in secret . I thought I heard a faint splash , then another and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the goat 's water dish empty , just as I expected . Unanimously we had voted to continue in Columbus 's path . It was San Salvador or nothing , come what might . Whether this was a vote of confidence or insanity , the northeasterly winds soon picked up and began driving us , for a change , toward San Salvador . In one day we actually went 117 miles , 80 in another , but our average was more like 45 . Our decision certainly had done something for our morale . From that point on we set to work in a far more orderly way . Each favorable morning our work day began at 10 as we dried our straw-and-maize mattresses , straightened up the cabin and cleaned up after Linda and Pinzona . We managed to get the starboard pump repaired by scaling its cracks with some pitch , and every . morning we performed the ritual of pumping . Life settled into the routine of the sea . Food was still our principal concern since our rations were now down to the starvation level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching fish . We laboriously converted our 15th-century spears and lances into harpoons , After the storms there came a strange calr and we struggled hour after hour to spear pilot fish or dolphin . I even tried to harpoon a porpoise , though l had often told the rest of the crew that a porpoise is a true friend of man at sea and should n't be killed under any circumstances . I learned then and there that a roan with a real empty stomach quickly changes his principles  --  or forgets them . Finally we tried eating what we thought was plankton . The result was disastrous . We scooped in our fine mesh dragnets and found only a gelatinous blob in the bottom . Michel , Jose and I each gingerly took a tiny portion , making faces at the taste but trying to pretend it tasted like caviar . After a few moments Jose said his tongue was on fire . Michel complained of a sting and rushed to the stern and vomited . Then I too felt it  --  a sensation like the hottest of Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up was not plankton but hundreds of stinging baby jellyfish . The animals had troubles too . We wondered if Linda had noticed that our dwindling supply of shark meat was tasting stronger each morning . I certainly noticed it . And poor Pinzona was getting more hungry stares every day . She was none too popular these days , for she 'd eaten just about everything within reach  --  including most of the caulking in our skiff . We still loved her dearly , but the day would soon come when our hunger would overcome our love . Before that day . however , Pinzona had to ride out the worst storm of all . It began on our 23rd day out when we were about 300 miles from Africa . The first storm warnings came at twilight . Lightning snapped on the horizon , and the seas began rising rapidly . So did the easterly wind . Within a few minutes we were plowing along at the unheard-of speed of seven knots . then eight or nine . This was a storm out of Joseph Conrad . The sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury . The gale whipped the spume of the waves in our faces and bent our mainmast like an archer 's bow . Nina plunged up out of the water like a rearing horse , then nosed down so low that we could n't steer . In the darkness we heard Manolo scream that he could n't hold the tiller . We struggled to get the sails in , but we could n't handle them . We even tried attacking them with our spears , but the wind finally did our work for us . It tore the bonnet sail to tatters , and in two hours we got the canvas to the deck . That night seemed endless , but the next morning was worse . By nine o'clock the sky was darker than a gravedigger 's foot . The rain pelted us like slivers of ice , and Niiia plunged through the mountainous seas with the stability of a castaway cork . Poor Pinzona was whinnying in terror . When I finally got below I found that Bedoya had a bad gash on his right hand and Antonio was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our ship seemed to be coming apart . The pressure on the mast had ripped open the scams of our top deck , and the rain poured in through the great cracks . But we were able to catch very little of it for drinking . During that second day every loose thing aboard washed over the side , including one of the pump handles . The other pump was useless . At the height of the storm we had to form bucket brigades and bail for our lives . No one said a word ; we were desperate , scared men fighting for survival . On one of my watches during this second day the tiller had suddenly whipped both my wrists painfully against the bulkhead . I knew our great wooden rudder was broken , and without it we were at the mercy of the ocean . For a full day we tossed helplessly as each towering wave danced before our eyes like a waterspout . Seas broke over us from all quarters . The only way to move safely on deck was to crawl . In spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to fix that rudder before the seas pounded us to pieces . On the storm 's third day we cut two of our rowing benches in half and made a crude sling . Then Carlos lowered me over the side with a supply of nails and line . That was the most desperate and the most frustrating piece of carpentry I 've ever tried . The rudder was split but still hanging together . It had to be firmly nailed . But as I tried to pound in the first nail the ship heaved , and I was under water . Then Nina pitched and the nail was out of my reach . As the stern came plunging down , I took a swing at it . Not once in 30 swings could I hit the nail squarely . A few glancing blows bent it . And I knew that just below me in the surging foam were sharks . All I could do was ignore them . It took two hours to pound in the first nail . It took 12 hours to drill three large holes through six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifth day I was so weak I had to be brought aboard with block and tackle . By then the storm was all but over , with the wind dying and the waves softening . It required a full 12 hours ' rest before any of us could find the strength to put up the sails . Another storm , and another But our troubles were far from over . Just as we were getting peacefully under way again another storm approached . Scarcely a week after the hurricane ended we saw the same dreaded signals in the sky . And when that storm died another one came . This was the hurricane season  --  a full month after we 'd expected to reach San Salvador . We scarcely kept track of when one storm ended and the next began . Our life became one long struggle , fighting with the tiller , fighting with the sails , and always bailing . To make the fight for survival worse , the winds and currents often worked against us , pushing us farther from our goal . Hot meals were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost so much weight that our trousers threatened to fall off . Now we had to face a small personal tragedy . It was finally coming time for Pinzona to meet her fate . Each day we eyed her hungrily and vowed to eat her on the morrow , but the next day we could always find a dozen reasons for postponing the slaughter . But Pinzona was growing thin . Her alfalfa and maize were all gone , and she seemed to survive only on salt water , wood and rope . One day Pepe milked her for the last time and gave the milk to Linda . We gave Pinzona a drink of fresh water , like a condemned man 's last meal . Then Jos ? hit her over the head with a hammer , and Michel slit her throat . Nothing was wasted . The blood was fried with onions and ham fat , and the intestines were boiled for soup . We had to do it , but we hated our decd . So did Linda the cat . She seemed uncommonly sad for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird mixture of scraps from our dwindling stores and anything we could catch . We broke out a bottle of warm , foamy champagne when Jose harpooned a dolphin . Some of us tried to remove all the worms from our remaining raisins , figs and prunes and put the hulks on deck to dry . We discovered that rotten figs cooked with straight rum are divine . But we had to watch our alcohol consumption carefully , because we were all so tense and exhausted that an argument could start in a flash  --  and often did . Carlos ordered no politics discussed , and we rationed the wine to five hotas , or goatskins. per day . Late in November , on our 48th day at sea , yet another storm took us completely by surprise and almost wrecked us . It was a squall that came out of nowhere , and its first mighty breath ripped out one of the bits which braced the mast . This lethal bit , with a vicious spike attached , flailed wildly about at the end of its line , threatening us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knew our mast and sails would be lost in a moment unless we regained the needed support . As we shouted warnings he went after it like a banderillero duelling with a fighting bull . Time after time he had to duck for his life as the ugly spike snapped by him . Finally he caught it , nearly breaking his hand , and Carlos and I made the line fast . And then we caught sight of the end . As the storm subsided we spotted our first floating Sargasso weed . It was just a dollar-sized chunk , but we knew we were at last approaching the great masses of floating weed which extend for several hundred miles near the Caribbean . Within a few hours we spotted patches of the dead-brown seaweed as large as a coffee table , and we mixed up a Sargasso-weed salad with vinegar and olive oil . The Sargasso Sea also has its sinister side , its deadly calms The winds which we had come to hate and fear now died away . Our tattered sails hung limp , and we scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a painted ship upon a painted ocean . " To take our minds off our hunger and thirst I read from the padre 's Ness , Testament while the other crewmen practiced English . Occasionally we caught a trigger-fish . We also caught a thin , silvery-blue fish that Michel said was a very rare species . It was about 18 inches long and had the razor teeth of a barracuda . He wanted to save it for a museum . But hungry men have no more interest in scientific specimens than they have love for a pet goat . We ate every scrap of the fish while Michel glared at us as though we were eating a newborn baby . On the morning of November 30 , on our 52nd day out of Las Palmas , there were signs that the calm was ending  --  but that worse lay ahead . We knew we were in the hurricane " slot , " and we could sense trouble . There were fast-running winds aloft , a drop in atmospheric pressure that you could feel in your head , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sweating in the hot , humid air , Bcdoya suddenly shouted , " Avian en vista y view direciamente pars nosotros , " or " Plane in sight and headed for us . " I sighted a twin-engine , dark-blue plane which I immediately judged to be a U.S. Navy hurricane hunter . It was roaring in upon us right on the deck . I was overjoyed to sec it , but I shouted to . Carlos that I was sure it was coming to warn us of a hurricane . As the plane buzzed us repeatedly the crew shouted their joy . We knew now that our families would know we were alive . On subsequent passes the plane dropped a sonar-buoy radio transmitter , a life raft and a Gibson Girl emergency radio . We retrieved them all by swimming or rowing out in the skiff . We also got a note which asked if we were Nina II . " What do they think we are ? " Jose exclaimed . " We look like a floating tree trunk that forgot to sink ten years back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked the plane to buzz us , then climb suddenly if a hurricane were approaching . We were as still as church mice as she buzzed us three times and each time failed to climb . So our fears were groundless , and we waved as the plane went on its way . That night we sang Anchors Aweigh and other Navy songs until exhausted . It seemed incredible to the other crewmen that such a big plane would search For us , and I had to explain patiently that the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy would search just as hard For any lost or overdue ship , whether an American was aboard or not . Jose said solemnly to me , " I 'll never , as long as I five , forget the U.S. Navy . " Three days later two other Navy planes buzzed us for three hours . After consulting with Carlos I told the planes on the sonar-buoy radio that we still intended to head not for the nearest land  --  at Antigua  --  hut for San Salvador . We did n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our last emergency jars . But we still had to sail our way in and there were some 600 miles  --  and probably more storms  --  between us and our destination . There was also a tragedy . One morning we missed Linda . During the night she had failed to cuddle next to inc . I took it for granted that she was somewhere else on the ship . The next morning we turned the ship upside down . We unfurled the lateen sail where she sometimes slept . We thoroughly inspected the hold . But Linda was not to be found . She had become more and more brazen about leaping about the rigging and taking chances , and she could only have fallen overboard during the night . Her voice was very weak , too weak for us to hear . Gradually we realized that Linda was gone . We were heartsick . The padre solemnly said a prayer for her . I t was strange how much we missed her , this tiny stray kitten who had joined us in Las Palmas and kept us company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mewing and preening and climbing the rigging , our ship seemed curiously lifeless from then on . Our two weeks ' calm finally ended . On our 59th day out the merciful trades that had supported Columbus from Spain finally began in earnest and drove us for six glorious days toward the Bahamas . We sang , jumped playfully around the deck , occasionally opened a bottle of spirits and prayed for water to augment the few gallons the Navy had dropped to us . From time to time we saw ships or planes , but we were still determined to continue our voyage as " authentically " as possible . We needed water , and we were grateful for tobacco , but when the Navy or Coast Guard dropped radios to us we asked that no ships be sent to aid us . To the world outside our small ship this must seem a foolish dedication to the ideal of authenticity . But to the crew of Nina 11 it was important . We had endured great peril for a historical principle . It would have been a serious matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We knew full well that we still belonged to the 20th century ; three times during the last phase of our trip we had seen the awesome spectacle of great rockets rising silently into the skies above distant Cape Canaveral . But we were also members of that ageless fraternity of seamen , each of whom owed a debt of gratitude to all the great explorers of the past . Two days before our target arrival date of Christmas , we established a lookout on the mainmast , night and day . And just as on Columbus 's trip , it was n't long before somebody thought he saw land , then saw it Fade . After a hall dozen false alarms nobody paid much attention when Jost Valencia announced at 3 P.M. on Christmas Eve that he saw something " suspicious " on the horizon . Only this time it did n't fade away . There it stayed , green and solid  --  land . As we realized what had happened , we gathered and began singing Salve Regina . The tears started to our eyes as we looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that easy . Our charts told us little about how to approach San Salvador , and it was sundown , with no sign of anyone awaiting us on the island . We decided to circle the island to reach the town of Cockburn . By midnight , steering toward the lights of the town , we got within half a mile of the pier  --  hut we could n't get in . No matter what we did , the wind and current pushed us back , the anchor would n't hold , and we had no way of signaling the town . All that exasperating night we drifted backward , away from our goal , until by dawn we were 15 miles out to the west of the island . At noon that day I finally used one of the flares the Navy had dropped us to signal a passing airliner . The Navy and Coast Guard sent a small motor vessel out for us , and it finally towed us in . It was not the perfect ending , but by this time we did n't care . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , we felt an overwhelming sense of triumph  --  and relief . Jose Robles fell to his knees and kissed the earth . The townspeople , by now out in throngs , welcomed us with cheers and calypso songs and started a feast that lasted until 4 A.M. Now I had at least a small idea of how Columbus must have felt on October 12 , 1492 . Above all I felt the infinite satisfaction of having accomplished what we set out to do , of following as nearly as we could in the historic wake of the great explorer . In the end that was worth the strain and the terror , the doubts and the endless labor against the sea .
