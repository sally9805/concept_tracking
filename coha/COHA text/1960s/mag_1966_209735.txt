The Red squares in the Kremlin are forever admonishing Soviet youth to devote more time to the " practical construction of a Communist society in our country . " But , alas , all too many kids suffer from " negative phenomena " : they like to have fun . For some time , teen-agers have displayed a distressing lack of interest in youth-league meetings and lectures , preferring to kill time at youth cafs and ice-cream parlors . Sometimes they get hold of vodka and roam the streets in gangs , smashing park benches and windows . Last June a bunch of high school students celebrated graduation with a rumble that killed one boy and injured 14 in Moscow . <P> Obviously the new year called for some good resolutions . The Moscow city council made several . Effective Jan. 1 , unescorted children under 16 are banned from public places after 9 p.m. on school nights , 10 p.m. on holidays . Children 's performances of plays , movies and sports events must end half an hour before curfew . Any child who wants to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such capitalist nonsense as a transit strike , but because bicycles are forbidden at all times to youngsters under 14 , motorbikes to all under 16 . Also no-go in most of the snowbound capital are sleds and skis , because they " disturb public order . " Presumably young Muscovites will now have plenty of time to curl up with , say , a good biography of Lenin .
