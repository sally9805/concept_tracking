THE FAMILY <P> As a child , Burt was thin , withdrawn and bookish . His father took the family all over the world-Hawaii , Brazil , France , Japan-as he climbed the ladder of a large chemical company . Three years ago , when Burt was 15 , the family moved to Palos Verdes , an affluent suburb south of Los Angeles . Almost overnight the youngster was transformed . He taught himself to surf , put on 50 Ibs. of muscle and a deep tan , was elected to the student council and began dating the prettiest girls . Though his grades slipped to the low B range , his parents were delighted . <P> Eight months ago , Burt 's parents stumbled on four " bricks " ( each a compressed kilo ) of marijuana hidden in his bedroom closet . " What the hell is this ? " demanded Burt 's father . " Stuff , of course , " answered Burt , nonchalantly adding that he had been taking pot ever since he arrived in California . <P> Aghast , his father wangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next school would be an Eastern board ing school . Burt laughed in his father 's face and disappeared for three weeks . When he returned , it was to announce his enlistment in the Marines . The fam ily now lives in Michigan . Burt is a pfc. in Viet Nam . <P> Attractive Models . If Burt does not quite seem like the boy next door , look again . He is a member of a new and rapidly growing group of drug users that the Rev. Melvin L. Knight Jr . calls " Billy-the-Kid drug heroes . " Knight , who is pastor of St. Peter's-by-the-Sea Presbyterian Church in Palos Verdes , observes : " These guys seem to be real straight arrows . They 're intelligent , good-looking . Good at sports , popular around school . They have all the characteristics of the old-style campus hero . But they also take and perhaps push drugs : marijuana , pills of all sorts . " For these youngsters , adds Knight , marijuana is not so much an instrument of defiance or a means of escape as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energetic life , " which is in many ways an all-too-attractive model for the younger kids . <P> <P> Though the National Institute of Mental Health 's most recent ( 1967 ) study reported that only 10% of the nation 's high school students had smoked marijuana , observers closer to the scene in many communities put the figure far higher . According to a Los Angeles Times survey of Palos Verdes last week , high schools there " now have a proportion of drug-experienced students which police estimate at 50% and counselors put at 75% . An estimated third of the total are habitual users . " Even more astonishing , the Times found , drug use has penetrated down to the sixth grade and does not always stop with pot : a few 13-year-olds are shooting the far more dangerous " speed " ( Meth-edrine ) . Often , with eerie sophistication they insert the hypodermic into the underside of their tongues to conceal the needle tracks . <P>
