CAROLINGIAN PORTRAITS ( 311 pp. ) - Eleanor Shipley Duckett-University of Michigan ( $5.95 ) . <P> Pleurisy gave Charlemagne a final month in bed , and he spent it searching for errors in Latin Bible texts . He could afford a sublime death . In the 46 years of his reign he had extended his empire across all Europe . With a kind of ecumenical zeal , he had made Christians out of Saxons , Serbs and Slavs , and with paternal zeal , he had made kings out of both his sons-Louis the Pious in Aquitaine , Pippin in Italy . He died at 71 , in 814. but his power was so immense that the full century that followed still bears his name . <P> Triple Lot . The last hundred years of Charlemagne 's empire are the subject of this meticulous study , drawn from diaries and church histories collected and translated by Medieval Scholar Duckett . With a treasure-trove of antique detail , she shows that just as life under Charles the Great had been purposeful and pious , life without him was chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the weight of weakness , jealousy and distrust . By midcentury , Europe was divided between Charles 's three grandsons-Lothar , Charles the Bald and Louis the German . In one of the rare medieval verses that combines reason and beauty , a bishop expressed the general woe : <P> Lost to the Empire is now both name and glory . The realm , once one , hath fallen in triple lot . No man is Emperor , assessed in thought or honor , For king a kinglet , for realm the realm 's dividings . <P> Guilt &; Impulse . Miss Duckett 's account , though marred by the errors of style that plague scholars who wish to entertain , is astonishingly rich in anecdote . Charlemagne was obsessed with his poor handwriting , constantly practiced it as he traveled over his lands in the royal coach . Charles 's son , Louis the Pious , began his reign by banishing his three bastard sisters to a convent , later blinded his nephew , Italy 's 18-year-old King Bernard , for plotting revolt . But afterwards Louis fell into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , Charles the Bald , was the prisoner of fatal impulsiveness : while revolt flickered along all France 's frontiers , Charles took his army off to Italy to help the Pope fight the heathen Saracens , leaving affairs at home in the crafty hands of his bishop , Hincmar of Reims , who showed his contempt for the King in tracts secretly circulated around the palace . " We have not foresaken our King , " he wrote . " He has foresaken us . " <P> Of all her pale heroes , Miss Duckett does best by Hincmar , whose Annals are the major source of her book . Hincmar lived 74 years , spent 40 of them in Prankish courts and divided his time between dark treatises on predestination and darker plots . Hincmar 's cold spirit is the only one that comes alive in the book and , seen in his final years , working tirelessly to bolster the inept rule of Louis the Stammerer , son of Charles the Bald , he seems the only man in the century who grew half the height of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
