All day , every day , Fidel Castro 's strident Radio Habana Cuba fills the hemisphere 's airwaves with Communist propaganda in an effort to stir a rebellion here , provoke a riot there , create chaos everywhere . Last week one of his neighbors had had enough . In Washington , Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Bonilla Atiles of the Dominican Republic went before the Council of the Organization of American States to lodge an official protest that Radio Habana was " attempting to destroy-by inciting to riot and murder-our beginning democracy . " <P> Calling itself " The Free Voice of America , " Castro 's radio spends 22 hours a day broadcasting its Marxist spiel in Spanish , English , Portuguese and French from six powerful transmitters , five of them 100,000 watts , in the Cuban town of Bauta , 23 miles west of Havana . Built with Swiss and Czechosloyakian equipment at an estimated cost of $35 million , the station started operating in April 1961 , and ever since has blasted the hemisphere with half-truths and diatribes . <P> Boss of the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who once wrote Cuban television comedy scripts . " Guest stars " on his programs are the hemisphere Castrophiles , who , in the fashion of World War II 's Tokyo Rose and Lord Haw Haw , sometimes outdo even the Cuban Communists . Three times a week , Radio Habana turns its antennas directly at Guatemala for a rabble-rousing half-hour broadcast by Jacobo Arbenz , 48 , the Red-lining ex-President of Guatemala who was overthrown eight years ago and now hopes to return via Cuba . <P> Before his return to the U.S. last March . ex-CBS Newsman Robert Taber , a founder of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee , figured in Castro 's English-language broadcasts . Another who still does is Barbara Collins , also known as " Beardless Barbara , " the 25-year-old daughter of a New Jersey clergyman . With her small daughter in hand , she skipped to Havana on a cruise ship , took out Cuban citizenship , and now chats winningly about the charms of Communist Cuba . Robert Williams , 37 , a North Carolina Negro who fled the U.S. to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious caste system . . . designed to permanently dehumanize all colored people . " <P> Counting the 138 hours directed at Latin America by Red China and Soviet Russia . Latin Americans are being bombarded by an overlapping 300 hours of Red propaganda a week . While this strident Red voice becomes something of a bore to Latin Americans , it is louder and longer than the Voice of America , which beams a mere 63 hours of Spanish-language broadcasts and 21 hours of Portuguese each week toward Latin America .
