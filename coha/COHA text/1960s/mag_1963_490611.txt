Notes and Comment SCIENCE takes away with one hand what it gives with the other . No sooner du Russian scientists claim that they have revived two lizards that had been frozen in the Siberian tundra for five thousand years than American scientists announce that there is no life whatever on Venus . In a way , we 're relieved , for there 's so much life in France , Cuha , and the subway these days that it 's a comfort to know there are still a few low-pressure areas in the universe . But in a way we 're sorry , for the tendrilous , polvoptical Venutian was , along with the wispy , transparent L unite and the green-skinned , snaggle-toothed , canal-building Martian , a childhood friend . How vivid the populations of other planets once seemed  --  far more imaginable than the residents of Cambodia or Chicago ! The people on Jupiter were terribly squat and slow , because of the intense gravity ; when they moved , it was like lava pouring , and when they talked , it was like furnaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hoop-skirts , whereas the folks un Neptune swam everywhere they went , carrying tridents . Pluto , so remote , cold , and small , seemed the planetary poor relation , and we pitied the cosmic hillbillies who had to live there , clad in rags , drinking cheap quicksilver , and trying to warm their shivering limbs in the rays of a sun no bigger than a star . At the opposite end of the system , but somewhat kindredly underprivileged , were the almost Caribbean individuals sweltering Out their lazy days on Mercury , which always kept the same side toward the sun , and where everything this side of silicon melted , making machinery impossible and architecture unstable . Now they tell us this is all fancy . Venus , far from being a tropical paradise beneath its mantle of perpetual clouds , is a baking limbo of eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit . Though there is still hope that a bit of moss enlivens Mars , the planets have , in effect , been given a clean slate . They are innocent of life , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel a little safer , and a little lonelier . AFRIEND of ours  --  a solid , unsurprising Wall Street lawyer in his late forties  --  has evidently been brooding over Mrs. Kennedy 's sojourn in this city last month . He finally got around to writing us about it , and his letter is so freighted with literary and social import that we hasten to pass it along . Since the writer had never previously revealed to us the faintest neoclassical tendencies , we can only interpret what follows as the first indication that all of us , suffering from a want of contemporary style , may be longing for a new Georgian era . " On a cold evening early in February , " the letter begins , " my wife , Lucille , and I and another couple went to the theatre and saw the visiting British production of ' The School for Scandal . ' To say that we enjoyed it is to put it far too conservatively . Marvellous , funny play ! Delightful cast ! Indeed , the only shadow on the entire evening was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy , who was visiting in the city at the time , and who , my wife had learned from an afternoon news broadcast , was scheduled to attend our performance of the play . Before the curtain went up , and again during the intermission , Lucille and my friend 's wife and most of the other female members of the audience stood on tiptoe and craned their necks and stared about in a hungry-faced way to make sure they were not missing the First Lady . She was not present , and over our after-theatre drinks the four of us speculated mildly , between our expressions of happiness about the play , as to whether a slight indisposition or the cold weather or some private party had kept Jackie from joining us . I thought no more of this until the following morning , when Lucille appeared at the breakfast table carrying a plate of toast and cried , ' How could she let us down like that ? ' I asked what the trouble was , and Lucille told me that she had just heard , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the theatre the night before but that she had chosen the Zero Mostel play , A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum . ' I then said , sensibly , that that explained why we had n't seen her . My wife burst out at me in the most startling manner . ' Oh , you do n't understand she exclaimed . ' We were at the right play . It was the only logical play for Jackie to go to . And then , for no reason at all , she had to change her mind and go to that other thing . Oh , I know it 's supposed to he funny , and all that , but it 's a vulgar play  --  not her kind of thing at all . ' I tried to reason with her . I said that , after all , Mrs. Kennedy had every right to choose her own evening 's entertainment . I said that we could not in fairness be annoyed with her , because we had bought the tickets weeks before , with no knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I even said that it was probably a relief for Jackie , away from her official duties , to he able to change her plans at the last moment . ' Oh , how can you he so dense ? ' Lucille answered . ' I mean , she 's the big cultural influence on all of us now , is n't she For all I know , you and I might never have dreamed of going to " The School for Scandal " if it had n't been for her toning everybody up about good books and art and everything . Well , then ! ' I grew a trifle annoyed at this juncture , and as I rose from the table I told Lucille that her interest in Mrs. Kennedy was entirely flighty and feminine , like her reasoning process . ' You probably only wanted to see what the was wearing , ' I said scornfully . ' Well , what of it ? ' she replied . ' Now that you mention it , I need some new dresses . I may just go out and buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . A few minutes later , however , in the Lexington Avenue express , as I was savoring my recollections of Sir John Gielgud and Sir Ralph Richardson and the previous evening 's high-flown dialogue , it suddenly came to me how much Richard Brinsey Sheridan would have enjoyed the ridiculous conversation at my breakfast table and how he would have burnished it . His lines were still fresh in my mind , I had no newspaper to distract me , and before my train had even reached Grand Central , I was able to metamorphose myself into Sir Peter and my wife into Lady Teazle , and to transpose our conversation somewhat into their manner : " Silt PETER : Lady Teazle , Lady Teazle , I 'll not bear it ! " LADY TEAZLE : Sir Peter , you may bear it or not , for you must own in this case , as always , that all the provocation is on your side and all the logic on my own . We were at the play , and Lady Kennedy was not , yet she had promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however you choke o n't . " SIR PETER : Lud , Madam , it is not I who will choke , but you , for you pop these words ' truth ' and ' logic ' into your mouth like so many cararnelos , where they dull your already delicate appetite for thinking . You speak as if the Lady in question had posted you her own hand-writ invitation to sit by her side at the theatricals . " LADY TEAZLE : And so she did , sir , by the repute of her taste , by her elevated character , and by the common report that preceded her . " SIR PETER : Oons , Madam , she knows you not ! " LADY TEAZLE : And no more do you , sir , since you take the part of another , as is your tedious custom in all our daily jangles . I say only that the great lady betrayed a captious humour and a want of delicacy in her sudden change of comedies . " SIR PETER : For my part , when I reflect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luncheons for Senator Timberline and Lord Protocol , the conversaziones with Mr. Cylinder , the grand assemblies for Lady Frizzle and Representative Oat  --  I wish her joy of her extempore evenings , even though she may choose but to witness a corner dogfight . Nay , Madam , such is the lady 's reputation that I 'll wager if she settled on this manner of entertainment , then in a week 's time dogfights should become all the rage in our society , and we should dispatch our powdered footmen in advance to secure our boxes in the dress circle for the next engagement between Master Pont() Terrier and Sir Puff Poodle . " LADY TEAZLE : You are a great bear , and your peevish fancies betray only your hebetudinous sense of decorum and fashion . " SIR PETER : Fashion , is it ? ' Fore Heaven , I am as well pleased that Lady Kennedy chose t'othcr entertainment , for her presence among us would have cost me the price of a new fichu , a silken turban , a headed pelerine , or whatever ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TEAZLE : Do you think , my love , that I need the example of others to encourage me in extravagance ? Ha ! Ha ! Please be so kind as to order up the phaeton on your way out , for you have reminded me I am sorely in need of six or a dozen of the finest and latest gowns for next week 's round of piquet parties and levees . You have restored me to my customary good humour , and I spend best when I am without malice . " SIR PETER : Without malice ! Plagues and tortures , Madam , you shall drive me to bedlam or to the poorhouse , I know not which first ! " At this point , my train drew into the Wall Street station . As I climbed the steps , a freezing wind blew a cloud of contemporary soot and candy wrappers about my head , and I tramped off to my office , muttering , " Slife , Mr. Sheridan , thou should'st be living at this hour ! ' " Artists for Artists THE Allan Stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madison Avenue , has just been the scene of what may prove to be an epochal new development in foundation-founding . More than seventy of our leading artists and sculptors , including such supernovae as Willem de Kooning , Jack Tworkov , Larry Rivers , and Mark Rothko , and a whole galaxy of the younger New Realist , or Pop , artists , such as Robert Rauschenberg , Jasper Johns , James Rosenquist , and Andy Warhol , donated one or two of their works for a week 's show that opened there February 25th and whose proceeds went into a fund to finance New York recitals and concerts by avant-garde musicians , dancers , and other needy practitioners of the performing arts . The show is over now , but the unsold pictures can still be seen ( on request ) , arc owned by the fund , and are for sale . The fund , which goes under the name of the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts , may stand as a historic watershed in the flow of money to artists , for it was not so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were themselves needy applicants for grants from the Guggenheim and other old-style , or pre-artbourn , foundations . At the somewhat seismic opening , we were told that Jasper Johns was the prime mover and organizer of the exhibition , and , accordingly , we wasted no time in calling on this highly influential young painter of targets , numbers , flags , and other New Realist talismans . We found him in his studio , which is , significantly , in a lower-Manhattan loft just a grant-in-aid 's throw from Wall Street . Mr. Johns , who proved to be courteous and poised , sat us down facing a large red-and-blue unfinished canvas . How , we asked him , had he managed to turn so many artists into patrons ? " It started last August , " he said , perching on a stool . " A group of us began to think about raising some money so that Merce Cunningham , the dancer , could have a New York recital . Merce has n't appeared in New York in two or three years . Most dancers in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear one night a year in some obscure hall , because there is simply no provision here for their kind of performance . Broadway is geared to the long run , and a limited engagement loses too much money . Anyway , the four people in the original group  --  John Cage , the composer ; Lewis Lloyd , a young producer ; Alfred Geller , a lawyer ; and myself  --  looked into it and found that it would cost over thirty thousand dollars to finance a week on Broadway for Merce and his company . We also found that we could n't expect to recover more than half of that at the box office . Impossible , obviously . Then we got the idea of setting up a foundation for short-run performances of this sort by Merce and others , and asking artists to donate their work to it . A lot of us have known Merce and other performers in the fields of music , the dance , and the theatre for years , and it just happens that the economic situation has improved for some of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no product for sale . Elaine de Kooning , Bill 's wife , and David Hayes , who 's with the Guggenheim Museum , came in with us at this point , and we set up a foundation , with ourseh es as directors . We all sat down then and drew up a list of the painters who we thought should be represented , and sent each of them a telegram explaining the idea briefly and inviting them to a party at the Allan Stone Gallery to discuss it further . Allan had offered us his gallery and his time , and offered to take no commission on anything sold from the show . Most of the people we asked came through magnificently , I must say . " Had it really been that easy ? Not altogether , said Johns , and went on to admit that the last two months had been an administrative hell . " A lot of artists offered us a choice of works , and that meant going around to everybody 's studio at least once to make the selection , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or they were out of town when we wanted to check , and we did n't really know until the last minute what we were going to get . When itirt News and a new magazine called . efrt Voices wanted to do pieces on the show , we had to dash out and take pictures of promised works with one of those Polaroid cameras  --  you know , the kind that develops the film in ten seconds  --  and even then their articles listed contributors who did n't contribute . We were much too busy to do anything about publicity  --  there were no newspapers anyway  --  and I had a feeling nobody would show up for the opening , which was on a Monday night . We planned to get the announcements out on the Wednesday before , so that people would get them on Saturday  --  Friday was ' Washington 's Birthday  --  hut the addressing machine broke down and we did n't get some of them out until Saturday . I guess the word got around , though . Allan Stone talked to everybody about the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire " Variations Within a Sphere , " which Lippold himself came in to hang , Johns installed every paint ing and sculpture in the show . The job took him all of Saturday night , all day Sunday , and most of Monday . Pictures kept turning up until the last moment . " Jim Rosenquist 's large canvas came in on Monday afternoon , wet , " he said . Elaine de Kooning , whose latest commission is a portrait of John F. Kennedy , was represented by an impressive portrait of Merce Cunningham , but her famous husband had nothing there on opening night . " He gave us two pictures , hut we did n't get them in time , " Johns said , a trifle ruefully . To judge by the packed opening , in the course of which seven works of art were either sold or reserved , the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts is now well launched . Tentative plans include an initial grant for a Merce Cunningham recital on Broadway sometime in April , provided a theatre can be found . ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience , " Johns explained . ) And requests have begun to pour in from other grant-seekers . " The main problem is still money , of course , " Johns said , sounding more and more like a foundation executive . " 1 , Ve have no way of knowing at this point how much we 'll make , but there 's certainly going to he no problem in giving it away . " ? INCIDENTAL INTELLLGENCE ( PROGREs DIVISION Incinerator Road , in Worcester , Massachusetts , has been renamed Fantasia Dnve . Self-Help THE first self-service restaurant in the world to have patrons prepare their own meals at their own tables recently opened its doors at 18 East Forty-second Street . The name of the restaurant is Tad 's , and it is the brain child of the three owners of Tad 's Steaks , Inc. , a national chain of old-fashioned , ot-som e body-el se-do-thepre.pa ring self-service restaurants . One of the owners , Mr. Neal Townsend , whom we 'll describe in a nutshell as a rangy San Franciscan , took us around the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our attention to the fact that it was divided into two sections  --  a front section , containing machines filled with various frozen foods and displaying life-size illuminated color transparencies of the foods , in , mercifully , a warmed-up state , and a back section , containing thirty-six tables for two and thirty-six tableside microwave ovens , into which the customer pops his food for what is technically known as reconstitution . " We 've a plant in the basement where our chefs cook the food , " Mr. Townsend said . ( We could n't help wondering what Brillat-Savarin would have made of " plant " in such a context ) " The food is put on specially designed plates , which are sealed with Cryovac , a plastic film , and then it 's blast-frozen at minus-forty degrees . We freeze the food fast in order to retain its goodness , and we cover it for the patrons ' sake ; frozen food simply is n't very attractive . After two hours at minus-forty degrees , the food is transferred to a storage freezer , where it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months without loss of flavor . Our plant cost us a third of a million dollars , and we 'd never get our money back on it if we were to service only this restaurant , with its capacity of seventy-two . If this Tad 's is successful , we 'll open two dozen just like it around town and service them all from here . " The average length of time a patron will have to wait for the reconstitution of the dish of his choice is two minutes , Townsend said . " Microwave ovens do in seconds what conventional ovens take minutes , or even hours , to do . Up to now , the microwave ovens that other restaurants have experimented with have been designed to work by time , requiring the user to set a dial for suchand-such a number of minutes ; our ovens are designed to work strictly by temperature . The customer puts his frozen food in the . ( ) yen and that 's all ; the food tells the oven when it 's done , and the oven tells the customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds , because different foods are palatable at different temperatures . A hamburger should he served at a hundred and forty degrees , while soup has to be served at a hundred and eighty degrees or it tastes cold . Our temperature range is from a hundred and forty to a hundred and eighty degrees , which takes care of pies and puddings as well as soups and main courses , and our time range is from forty seconds , for pancakes and toasted sandwiches , to two minutes and thirty seconds , for Yankee pot roast and ham steak All very tasty . I predict that a few years from now there 'll he only two kinds of restaurants left  --  very expensive ones , like The Four Seasons , and microwave restaurants , Like this One , whose prices compare favorably with ordinary cafeteria prices . The average restaurateur is in a tight squeeze because of his labor and food costs . Here we need only five attendants , instead of the usual fourteen for an operation of this size . We also save a lot b ) eliminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the culinary wave of the future . " ?

Friend of Central Park " M RS . ALMA C. GIJILLET , an eighty-four-year-old lady who lies near Morningside Heights , just north of Columbia University , knows ev rrything about the flora of Central Park , " a reader wrote us . " She 's particularly fond of the Park 's mushrooms , which she gathers , cooks , and eats . Many rare and luscious varieties apparently flourish there . " Thus alerted , we called on Mrs. Guillet for a mycological chat . " I 've haunted the Park for thirty-five years , and I 've never seen a mushroom there , " she said . " But I have identified miver five hundred species of trees and shrubs , including sixtti kinds of hawthorn , and I 've drawn most of them  --  leaf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest and finest trees and shrubs are foreign . In the eighteen-sixties , when the Park was planted , nurseries here were few and small , and it was easier to buy trees from abroad . There 's a katsura tree ( just one ) ? a tree from China  --  on the west side of the Park , near the Seventy-ninth Street transverse . It has a purple flower with a red stamen . There 's only one red mulberry , a native , but there are several Chinese elms  --  one is the finest on this continent  --  and there are native black alders , black cherries , black walnuts , and purple chokeherries , along with Asiatic garden plums and Chinese weeping willows . There arc some Japanese pagoda trees  --  in the Ramble . They have very feathery leaves , like our locust , and they stay green longer than the locust . Last winter , a barred owl lived in the Park for six weeks . He was nearly two feet tall . Oh , he was a marvellous sight ! He preferred to be near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rats . Another spectacular sight once saw was a turkey hawk devouring a squirrel . I visit the Park occasionally in winter and continually in the spring and fall ; summers I spend in Ontario , with my son and daughter-in-law and various grandchildren and great-grandchildren . We own an island there , in Stony Lake . " Mrs. G. told us that the northern section of the Park is the most natural , abounding in hickory , white ash , and birch . " I have begged and begged the Parks Department to put in trails for schoolchildren there , " she said . " I 've written a hook about trees and shrubs in American parks , and I plan to follow it up with a series of guidebooks to Central Park , which I hope will get into the public schools and arouse interest .

" He introduced me to the wonders of the Park , " she said . " I was especially interested in its flora , because I was the director of the Arts and Crafts Department of the Riverside Church and wanted my design classes to get close to nature . I began to go to the Park every week . I found that the Parks Department people in the Arsenal could n't identify any of the sprigs I took them , so I went up to the Botanical Garden , where Edward J. Alexander , an associate curator , and Elizabeth Hall , the librarian , were most helpful . And I persuaded Mr. George K.almbacher , the taxonomist of the Brooklyn Botanical Garden , to go through the Park with me and identify specimens . I take a nature class to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members are n't really botanists ; they 're just enjoying life . They have to be told the same things over and over . " Mrs. Guillet showed us some horticultural maps and drawings that she has made for her guidebook to the Ramble , and told us that she hopes to do four others , on other sections of the Park . " They will have waterproof covers , " she said . " The two and a half miles of the Park contain a hundred and forty thousand trees and shrubs , of over five hundred species . I 'm trying to persuade the Parks Department to convert the Reservoir into a fishing pond . I believe that would do more to lessen crime than anything else you could do in the city . I 've given the royalties from my hook to the Park Association of New York City to buy rare trees and shrubs for the Park . Mr. Louis Politi , the horticulturist of the Botanical Garden , has procured them from lists I 've given him . " Mindful of the Park 's reputation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever run into any trouble there .

On a flight to Washington , she saw Mr. and Mrs. Kahn each bring a book aboard with which to while away the tedium of the passage . Soon after takeoff , they apparently discovered that one hook was interesting and the other was not , for Kahn , in less time than it takes a missile to reach the stratosphere , put one under his seat and began to read the other .
