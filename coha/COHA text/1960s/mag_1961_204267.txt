As befits a religious council , the long days in New Delhi usually ended with a prayer service held under the cavernous shamiana ( canopy ) . During working hours , the 577 delegates to the third Assembly of the World Council of Churches struggled to frame a coherent stand for non-Roman Catholic Christianity on the major issues of the times . Last week , after 18 days of debate , the Council adjourned . It will probably meet again six years from now ; Ethiopia and Australia have already offered to serve as hosts . <P> " This assembly was far more dynamic than Amsterdam in 1948 or Evanston in 1954 , " said Manhattan Lawyer Charles Parlin , the Methodist layman who will serve as one of the Council 's presidents . " It has been an extremely serious , united effort of giving directives for work . " The Council 's General Secretary , Willem Visser ' t Hooft ( TIME cover , Dec. 8 ) , agreed that " we have received pretty clear marching orders , " although , he added cautiously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little further . " <P> The marching orders covered nearly everything from Portuguese oppression in Angola ( disapproved by a narrow margin of 179-177 ) to admission of Red China into the U.N . ( gingerly favored ) to anti-Semitism ( bitterly condemned ) . But the clearest expression of the Council 's mind came in the three major reports on 1 ) Christian Service , 2 ) Witness , and 3 ) Unity . In this triad of messages , the Council reflected both its actuality as a going , growing concern , and the difficulties still to be faced in giving the right weight to beliefs so different as those of Greek Orthodox Metropolitans and Pentecostal missionaries from South America . <P> THE REPORT ON SERVICE displayed the churches ' keen awareness of social change and its effect on Christian life . It called on the church to " strive actively for racial justice " and urged Christians from rich nations to help poorer lands . It urged Christians " to work for political institutions which encourage participation of all citizens , and which protect both the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convictions . . . The state is not the Lord of the conscience . " As might be expected of a message from Christians , the report was strong in defense of human and political rights , warning that " government without consent of the governed can not be approved by Christians in our time . " But in an appraisal of problems faced by new nations , it admitted the likelihood of " emergencies " that " seem to call for temporary authoritarian regimes . " " Some of these systems , " it said , " are more authoritarian than those whose outlook has been molded by the Western tradition of democracy would find acceptable for themselves . Yet the difficulty of maintaining order . . . may call for new forms of political life . "
