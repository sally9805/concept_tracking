txt Hazleton , Pa. , Aug. 24 ? Dan Bova. a wiry little man with flecks of gray in his hair , watched intently today while rescue workers continued efforts to reach his brother , Louie , 42 , and two other miners . " There 's a lot of people who think that Louie is dead , " he said , " but I know better . He 's too tough a guy to go like this . " Dan , who is 48 , said that he had been a little worried because Louie had n't had anything to eat in the 12 days since the mine in which he was working collapsed . But yesterday 's developments have given him new hope . " He 'll Be All Right " " I heard that they dropped those new white pine strips down there last night and then I knew that Louie would be all right . Right now . while we 're sitting here . he 's probably down there chewing on that bark and getting the juice out of it . He 's smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are six brothers and three sisters in the Bova family and many of them have been at the mine site every day . They are shy people  --  overawed by the sudden descent of hundreds of strangers upon the scene . It rankles them that so many people are saying openly that Louie will never come out of the mine alive . Dan expressed amazement at the number of reporters who are on the scene . Fears They 'll Be in Way " There 's one thing I ca n't understand , " he said . " Look at the way they 're putting those big towers up for the television cameras . Do you know they 're only 50 feet away from the shaft now ? Why do they all have to be down here so close ? " Seems to me like they 're all going to get in the way when the time comes to raise Louie up the shaft . " Dan said that he has devised a plan that might speed up the rescue of his brother . He has been trying to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dog and give him a shot of something to put him asleep . Then we could lower him down the shaft . " He 's a little hunting dog and once he got down there he 'd be able to sniff around and find Louis even tho he is n't directly in that chamber . " Bova is believed trapped in a chamber on the other side of the narrow shaft . There has been no word from him since last Tuesday . At that time , David Fellin reported that Bova was tapping on the other side of the wall . " Louie 's all right , " Dan said . " There 's even one thing a little funny about it and I 'm sure he 's going to get a big kick out of it when I tell him . " A bill collector came around with some papers the day Louie went down in the mine . He had some papers that said they were going to foreclose on the mortgage on Louie 's house . " Dan Bova slapped a hand on I his thigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'll sure get a kick out of it . "
