txt President Johnson brought his impromptu weekend tour of military installations today to , the golf course winter home of the most famous soldier of them all  --  former President Dwight D. Eisenhower . Seeking a nonpartisan atmosphere for what he has been advertising as a time of decisive testing in Vietnam , Mr. Johnson conferred with his Republican predecessor for about three hours . Lieut . Gen. Lewis W. Walt , deputy commandant of the Marines , and Walt W. Rostow , the President 's special assistant , gave General Eisenhower an up-to-date briefing on the war . Mr. Johnson told the general that the enemy was believed to have been badly hurt in the recent fighting . Presumably he told him in Greater detail what he has been telling the combat troops on their way to war and the sailors and fliers recently back from the battle zone . When Men Must Stand ' " Men may debate  --  men may dissent  --  men may disagree , " Mr. Johnson said on the deck of the aircraft carrier Constellation this morning , " and God forbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not . " But there does come a time when men must stand . And for America , that time has now come . " Addressing the men among whom he had spent the night aboard the carrier and with some of whom he worshiped on her hangar deck this morning , Mr Johnson continued : " In Vietnam today , the foes of freedom are making ready to test America 's will . Quite obviously , the enemy believes ? he thinks  --  that our will is vulnerable . Quite clearly , the enemy hopes that he can break that will . . And quite certainly , we know that the enemy is going to fail . " So we have taken our stand . We shall do all to stand  --  all that is asked , all that may be required . " New Attack Uncertain Mr. Johnson indicated to newsmen in his quarters aboard the Constellation late last night that he did not know for sure that the Vietcong and North Vietnamese forces had begun the expected second round of their winter offensive . But he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public talks , that he accepted the judgment of the senior military commanders that there had been a significant shift in Communist strategy . This strategy , they believe , is aimed at breaking the back of the South Vietnamese Government and Army and the will of the United States to defend them . " They are going for broke , " the President explained to reporters . " Heretofore , it has , been a hit-and-run thing . " In their first attacks on cities , and American installations ) three weeks ago , Mr. Johnson ; ; continued , the enemy expected ; to capture and hold some places ! and to create all the havoc ' possible . " What they are going to do ; this time , we will just have to ; sec. " the President said . " 1 do n't think anybody can predict . These things vary from ' dine to time . At this time we ; do n't know what they are going ; to do . How extensive they make ) it is up to them . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President ; was doing . He took off on short notice from Washington yesterday afternoon . addirr , some of his ; itinerary as he moved cross-1 country , to put to rest some of the doubt and dejection about ; Vietnam that had become so ; evident in Washington . His attitude throughout the trip has been sober and determined . He has not joked much ? except about the unfortunate ; sailors who were at liberty from ; the Constellation and were thus ; " forced to spend Saturday night ashore " during his visit . But neither has he let the sight of the armed forces and ) their weapons push his rhetoric ; to patriotic heights , as on past ; occasions . Mr. Johnson suggested repeatedly that the search for ! peace appeared to be exhausted ; and that therefore the time for debate had come to an end : while brave Americans made their stand in battle . The President flew yesterday ) afternoon to the Pope AirForce Base near Fort Bragg , N.C. , to watch elements of the 82d Airborne Infantry Division depart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Calif . ) Marine Corps Naval Air Station , from which elements of the Fifth Marine Division were also being airlifted into combat . Many of them , as Mr. ; Johnson noted with pride , were ' going for their second tours in the war zones , some as volunteers . The two divisions are supplying the 10,500 men Mr. Johnson is rushing to Vietnam to reinforce thin lines of defense at the request of Gen. William C. Westmoreland , the American commander in the war zone . Mr. Johnson then made the half-hour helicopter trip from El Toro to the Constellation . The huge carrier , which returned from duty off Vietnam in December . sailed about 15 miles out to sea from San Diego to receive the Commander-inChief and to serve his party as a hotel and forum for ceremonies . Only about 60 per cent of her crew could be rounded up for the visit . The President had breakfast this morning with a score of sailors and fliers and then attended Protestant services on the hangar deck beneath a huge sign that read " Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He addressed the crew on the flight deck , took a 21-gun salute and then wove his way by helicopter through the Santa Rosa Mountains to the idyllic oasis of Palm Desert , 120 miles east of Los Angeles . He was greeted on the Eldorado Country Club golf course beneath date palms and snow-capped ridges by General of the Army Eisenhower ? ruddy and red beside the relatively pale complexion of Mr. Johnson , wearing a bright yellow shirt and sport jacket besides the austere gray of the President . The two men chatted briefly ; ; while posing for pictures , with ' General Eisenhower recalling ; that it was the writers , not the photographers , that used to ! cause him the most trouble ' in the White House . Then they strolled 100 yards to the Eisenhower home , a one- ; story modern desert structure ; like all the others in this ) wealthy resort . After what was described as ; a " good talk , " the President and the general sat down to lunch . Following lunch , they played golf on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club . The President later left for the Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington .
