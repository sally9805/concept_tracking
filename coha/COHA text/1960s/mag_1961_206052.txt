More than most youthful industries , the burgeoning U.S. computer business is dominated by giants-IBM , Philco , Sperry Rand . A notable exception is an aggressive young Minneapolis firm with the electronic-era name of Control Data . In four years , Control Data has risen from the brink of financial ruin to such strength that on occasion it can even push the big boys around . The formula , explains professorial William C. Norris , Control Data 's 50-year-old president , is disarmingly simple : " Aim for a piece of the market and then do a better job than anyone else . " <P> So far , Control Data 's aim has been so true that its sales have soared from $625 , - 756 in fiscal 1958 to $20 million last year . Earnings hit $842,000 in 1960 and Control Data stock , originally issued at $1 a share , is now traded at about $42 after a three-for-one split . <P> The Deserters . Control Data was born when Norris and eleven colleagues deserted Sperry Rand in a body , touching off one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team had had their own research firm from 1946 until 1952 , when Remington Rand bought it . After Remington Rand merged with Sperry in 1955 , Norris became a vice president and general manager of the Univac division , but his research team was dismembered . When his men asked him to lead them in setting up a new company , Norris agreed . <P> The new company barely survived its birth pangs . To get plant space , Norris &; Co. bought Minneapolis ' overextended Cedar Engineering Inc. , but they badly miscalculated the funds they needed to turn the company around . To ward off ruin , Control Data 's top 20 employees took a 50% salary cut . <P> What saved the company was a breakthrough by Engineer Seymour Cray in the emerging field of solid-state computers . By using transistors instead of vacuum tubes , and cheap printed circuits instead of miles of intricate wiring , Cray developed Control Data 's reliable and relatively cheap ( $1,250,000 ) 1604 computer , thus enabling the company to introduce its solid-state computer on the commercial market neck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new headaches . Sperry Rand , alleging that Norris &; Co. were using pirated Sperry Rand trade secrets , sued to enjoin them from capitalizing on any more of the know-how they had picked up before the mass decampment . Norris ' rebuttal : in the fast-moving electronics industry , there is no such thing as a meaningful trade secret . <P> Through the Heavens . The Sperry Rand suit remains unsettled , but Norris and colleagues are confidently pushing ahead . On the strength of the 1604 's immediate success , Control Data raised the money to develop two desk-size computers and one medium-size one . Also under development is Control Data 's most ambitious effort yet-the huge , advanced-design 6600 computer which will sell for between $8 million and $12 million .
