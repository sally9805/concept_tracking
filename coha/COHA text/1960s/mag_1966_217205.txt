WILLIAM FAULKNER : ESSAYS , SPEECHES AND PUBLIC LETTERS , edited by James 8 . Meriwether. 233 pages . Random House . $6 . <P> <P> William Faulkner had a thing about privacy . " If I were reincarnated , " he once told a friend , " I 'd want to come back as a buzzard . Nothing hates him , or envies him , or wants him , or needs him ; he 's never bothered or in danger , and he can eat anything . " <P> Because Faulkner only rarely gave interviews about his work , never permitted journalists to pry into his private life , and refused to play the celebrity , the press made him something of a myth-laden enigma during his lifetime . The oddest myth of all is that Faulkner was a recluse in his classical Southern mansion in Oxford , Miss. , and found company only in countless demijohns of bourbon while he wrenched out his primeval and difficult prose . <P> He was a drinker all right , and he was often shy with strangers , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had a coterie of fishing and hunting companions in his home town , as well as numerous publishing friends in New York . He was always given a top table when he dropped in at Toots Shor 's or " 21 " on his frequent visits to New York , graciously gave his autograph when asked , and readily discussed writing with perfect strangers - if they were not newsmen . In 1957 and 1958 , he was the writer-in-residence at the University of Virginia , and in 1962 lectured on writing at West Point . Moreover , perhaps no major U.S. writer ever used his pen so diligently and profitably in so many different ways . After his first success with Sanctuary in 1932 , he frequently worked in the movie factories in Hollywood , wrote formula short stories for the Saturday Evening Post , and occasionally knocked out a book review for the New Republic or American Mercury . <P> Uneven Talents . As this collection proves , Faulkner was particularly busy from 1950 onward . Far from being a recluse , he reported on the Kentucky Derby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for other magazines , and took a lively interest in public affairs . But just as his recently republished verse , The Marble Faun and A Green Bough ( TIME , Nov. 26 ) , showed that he was not much of a poet , this collection indicates that he possessed woefully uneven talents as a speaker , essayist and letter writer . <P> Readers who have fought their way through the syntactic quagmires of Faulkner 's fiction will be mildly surprised to find that he could sometimes be straightforward and lucid , as in his Nobel Prize Speech of 1950 ( " I believe that man will not merely endure : he will prevail " ) . Far less inspiring , however , was Faulkner 's commencement address to the 1953 graduating class at the Pine Manor Junior College in Wellesley , Mass . The talk is so gauze-wrapped with mystical abstractions about man and his condition that the poor students must have stumbled away from it in a stupor . The essays , too , are recommended only for veterans of the quagmires who may still have their hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
