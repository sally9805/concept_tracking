When he took over the " wreck " of Washington , D.C. 's integrated public schools 2 years ago , Superintendent Carl F. Hansen confounded pessimists everywhere by raising academic standards higher than they had been under segregation ( TIME . Feb. 1 ) . His latest innovation may do even more to revolutionize the capital 's educational system . Called Amidon School , it is a determined effort to resolve the longstanding war between " basic " and ' ' progressive " education by developing a curriculum that combines the best of both . <P> Begun last month in an urban-renewal area in southwest Washington . Amidon is open to any Washington child whose parents provide transportation . Its 465 students , about half of them Negro , are housed in a two-story red brick building that looks like any other elementary school in the land . The big difference lies in the premise on which Hansen has founded Amidon : " The main purpose of organized education is to cultivate the basic subjects as the building blocks of intelligent behavior . " <P> Indians &; Doorbells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that problem solving is more interesting than rote learning . But he thinks progressives underestimate the pride that children take in acquiring intellectual skills . Instead of directly teaching the skills necessary to solve problems , progressive schools resort to a kind of subliminal advertising . They start out with " units of experience " built around such hardy fascinators as " the Red Man . " After interviewing an imported chief in full headdress , children write Indian themes-supposedly absorbing grammar and spelling along the trail . <P> Instead of liberating young minds , argues Educator Hansen. this method often imprisons them . When science is cloaked in a " home unit , " it may get stuck at the doorbell-and never reach the principles of electricity . Says Hansen : " One is inclined to be interested in what one knows . Children want still more of the American Indian because that is what they know . This is not helping them to learn . " <P> Teaching &; Thinking . Unlike all-out progressive educators , Hansen refuses to " leave learning to chance . " Though Ami-don 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will not be " lost in a hodgepodge of unit teaching . " Reading begins with phonics in first grade and formal grammar starts in fourth grade ( two years earlier than in most U.S. schools ) . Writing is heavily emphasized because it " improves and refines thinking " - and the same goes for math and science . More outrageous yet by progressive standards , geography focuses on specific places , and U.S. history is taught in chronological order " to develop an historian 's capacity to see and evaluate primary sources . " <P> Forward Step . All this , insists Hansen , is not just " a reversion to the stilted education of the turn of the century . " In fact , he adds with a quiet smile . " I could be wrong , but I think this is the direction education will take in this country . "
