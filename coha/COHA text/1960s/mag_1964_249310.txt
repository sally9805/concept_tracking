EASTERN EUROPE <P> While Russia 's grain shortage makes the news , it is only the most prominent of a whole basketful of economic problems that plague the Communist bloc . COMECON , the eight-nation group created by the Communists in frank imitation of the Common Market , not only has failed to relieve the economic chaos in Eastern Europe , but in many ways has actually worsened it . So nightmarish is their job that the satellite economists have begun to grumble openly . <P> A group of leading Czech economists recently blasted nationalization and collectivization , and called for the introduction of a price system based on supply and demand . In Hungary , Trade Expert Imre Vajda last month deplored COMECON 's " regrettable sluggishness " and " antiquated concepts , " called for more " endeavor to cooperate with capitalist enterprises . " <P> Disillusioned by COMECON 's failure , Eastern Europe is indeed turning to the West for more trade and technology . Czechoslovakia last week was in the final stages of negotiating the $31 million purchase of a petrochemical plant and steel-mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more U.S. wheat . But it will take a good deal more than increased trade with the West to solve Eastern Europe 's widespread economic problems . Items : <P> POLAND . Poland is the sick man of Eastern Europe . The country has mammoth debts abroad , and practically no money to pay them with . Overcentralization of planning and overemphasis on heavy industry have reduced its already weak economy to a shambles . Poor harvests and poorer planning have forced it to import huge amounts of grain , thus dangerously depleting its foreign currency reserves . Typical of Poland 's plight is the condition of its national airline , LOT , which is being gradually grounded by a bizarre price structure , antiquated equipment , and the failure of Russia to come through with promised modern planes . <P> EAST GERMANY . Bled by massive inefficiency , defections of specialists to the West and a rigid regime that compounds its own mistakes , East Germany now depends on West Germany for much of its manufactured goods . Trade between the two last year reached $500 million . Less known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , U.S. exports to East Germany have risen dramatically in the last year , largely through U.S. sales of wheat , tobacco , and other farm goods . <P> CZECHOSLOVAKIA . Though in better shape industrially than most of the Iron Curtain countries , Czechoslovakia has experienced such a rapid decline in the rate of capital investment that the famed Czech automaker Skoda had to reduce its output last year by 15% to 54,000 autos . In a rather pitiful move to entice Western companies to sell their goods in Czechoslovakia , the government recently offered them the opportunity to advertise on TV or in Czech newspapers . There have been no takers . <P> RUMANIA . Rebelling against its COMECON-assigned role as Eastern Europe 's vegetable garden and oilfield , Rumania has turned to the West for iron and aluminum plants . A new three-year trade agreement with West Germany provides for an exchange of goods worth $300 million . But Rumania must finance industrialization by exporting food . The unhappy result is a severe food shortage and painfully high prices ; eggs go for 20 apiece .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
