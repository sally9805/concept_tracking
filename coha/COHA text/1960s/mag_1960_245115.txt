The most discussed picture in Manhattan can not be seen-except in reproduction ( opposite ) . Salvador Dali 's Christopher Columbus Discovers America , commissioned by A. &; P. Heir Huntington Hartford , was given a one-day " private " champagne showing at Manhattan 's French &; Co. attended by a handful of critics and a mob of snobs , then rolled up and stored away to await the opening of Hartford 's " Gallery of Modern Art " on Columbus Circle two years hence . <P> <P> The 14-ft-high picture enraged many , as Dali 's works usually do . But it is a major work by one of the ablest , strangest and least understood of living artists . Dali himself , with cat 's eyes agleam and mustachios en garde , speaks of it as " a meta-pheesical dream . " It took Dali six months to paint , and one syndicate reporter estimated that it also put $250,000 in his pocket . The estimate seems absurdly high , perhaps triple the actual price . Says Hartford : " If a quarter of a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , we accept . " <P> Dawn in Cadaques . To anyone familiar with the Costa Brava of northeastern Spain , the first impression the picture makes is its truth to nature . The dawn light of Cadaques , where Dali spends six months of the year , shines through every part of the vast canvas , and the Santa Maria floats on a mother-of-pearl sea precisely like a Cadaques fishing boat at dawn . Her sails , however , are inventions . The transparent topsail shows the silhouette of a combined crow's-nest and Holy Grail . <P> Columbus , planting on American soil the banner of the Immaculate Conception , " ees shown as a youth , " Dali explains in his macaronic idiom , " because thees painting represent le dream of Columbus , and youth ees le time for dreams . Other figures are monks and sailors qui come along weeth Columbus . " Modestly he adds that the monk completely hidden in his cowl is actually a self-portrait . The giant sea urchin in the foreground represents " le real shape of le earth as discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanguard Beta ) . In his dream , Dali 's young Columbus meets not Indians but symbols of past and future . He is greeted by a transparent Saint Narcissus , whose body is formed partly of flies . Why ? Easy , says Dali : " Le French cavalry que attacked Gerona in 1808 was defeated by many , many flies from zee grave of Narcissus . " Dali maintains that Columbus was born in Gerona. *
