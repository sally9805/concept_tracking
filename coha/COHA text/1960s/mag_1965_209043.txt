When Crooner Andy Williams canceled an engagement in Las Vegas last summer to play the state-fair circuit , the supposition was that he had just won an uncontested divorce from his senses , or that he ought to start proceedings against his agent . After all , Vegas , that bonanza city of the show world , would have paid him $50,000 a week . And what could he make from the likes of the Corn Palace Fair in Mitchell , S.D. ? As it turned out : $70,500 in six days . <P> So this season , without even a feeler to Vegas , Williams has whirled past more fairgrounds than Astronauts Cooper and Conrad ever did . In fact , the state-fair circuit has become an unpublicized gold mine of show business . Not for everyone . The star of the fair circuit must be folksy , decent , no-putting-on-airs , and never , never step out of character . Williams is the circuit 's ideal singer , Tennessee Ernie Ford its ideal comic , Liberace its favorite pianist , Lawrence Welk its ideal bandleader . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never lets on he is only an actor pretending to be a cowboy . Says Agent Mike North , the Hurok of the hinterlands : " You could n't give away Bob Goulet , Frank Sinatra , or Dean Martin . And Danny Kaye and The Man from U.N.C.L.E . would also bomb . " But those who can make it , make it big . Like , say , $15,000 a night . <P> Dog Acts . Ten summers ago , the fairs were paying the stars only a quarter that much-if they were booking stars at all . Most of the fairs made do with just acrobats and dog acts and perhaps a kick line of local chorus girls . Sometimes the whole show was included in the dollar-odd price of admission , right along with the exhibition barns and the competition sheds full of fancy needlework and loganberry jam . At other fairs , an additional couple of dollars per head were charged for the grandstand entertainment , but it was usually a loss leader . <P> <P> The Ohio State Fair , which had been running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1956 and was about to give up . But it was talked into gambling one last time the following year-with Roy Rogers . Rogers , gambling himself , signed a no-guarantee contract , giving the fair the first $10,000 and 25% of the rest . He left town with $84,000 . That was the big breakthrough for big-name headliners at the fairs . In time , Rogers was bringing in so much profit that his take ranged up to $234,000 for ten nights at the Wisconsin State Fair in 1958 . <P> <P> But the fair circuit also imposes its conditions . Even between shows , the headliner is always on . He can count on being greeted by the mayor , booked to attend a P.T.A . lunch , scheduled to address the Lions ' Club . The most conscientious , like Ernie Ford , spend off-hours playing the local children 's hospital , old folks ' home , and perhaps the jail . There are command performances at shopping centers and interviews with every 1-kw. disk jockey in the county . And the stars ' best chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off limits to Mike North 's clients . " You ca n't win , " he advises . " If you do n't drink , you 're a snob , and if you do , you 're a gutter drunk . "
