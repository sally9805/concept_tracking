Jacksonville , commercial center of Florida 's Duval County , wears all the badges of a prosperous city in a space-age state : bustling expressways , glass-skinned office towers , a rebuilt water front . But Duval 's high schools are so poor that teachers raise money for supplies by sending students out to sell candy and chewing gum . Low salaries keep the schools short of teachers and shabbily maintained . Textbooks are old ; one history hesitantly predicts that man might some day orbit the earth . But stingy spending on schools finally proved to be a costly policy . The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools has disaccredited all 15 of the high schools in Duval County-the first time that the association ever whacked off a whole system . <P> As in most U.S. cities , Duval school budgets are determined by real-estate taxes . But two-thirds of the county 's householders duck out of taxes by virtue of low appraisals of the market value of their properties . When these appraisals are figured at the official assessment rate of 42% , they mostly fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient " homestead exemption . " Every attempt by worried parents to elect an assessor who would raise appraisals has met defeat . Turning from the polls to the courtroom , a band of determined Jacksonville citizens this week begins testifying in a suit that seeks to force the assessment of all property at fully 100% of market value . <P> Disaccreditation by the Southern Association put the county 's 116,000 high-school students in a jam . Though they can still enter Florida 's state-run universities freely , private and out-of-state colleges often require that the applicant be a graduate of an accredited high school . Duval County also worried about its economy : new business nowadays can hardly be attracted to areas with schools authoritatively pronounced to be bad .
