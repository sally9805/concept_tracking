Jim Dine , 26 , is one of those artists who are hard to take seriously and equally hard to laugh off . They produce kooky art so earnestly that it makes a certain sense . In his current show at Manhattan 's Martha Jackson Gallery , Dine concentrates on paintings of articles of clothing - suspenders , shoes , hats , and a gaudy parade of neckties . Dine fans have bought up three-fourths of the paintings , and the show boasts a learned interpretation by the British critic Lawrence Alloway . who was recently named curator at the Guggenheim . <P> Cincinnati-born Dine hit the Manhattan scene only three years ago , but his name is one to reckon with in avantgarde circles . Like a number of other rebels against abstract art , he began producing art not out of paint and canvas , but out of everyday objects . " I loved the city . " he says , " I loved seeing so much being discarded . Every time you turned a corner , you 'd see in the next trash can some wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the " found object " school-a group dedicated to the proposition that many an old piece of junk , if placed in a fresh context , would become a thing of beauty . Then Dine decided that he did not want to deal with found objects any more . " There 's too much of other people 's mystery in them , " he explains . <P> <P> Four-Sided Collages . At one point Dine took up what has become known as " happenings . " which are essentially ideas or feelings spontaneously acted out for an audience against a background of painted props . In one of his happenings called The Smiling Workman , Dine was seen writing ' ' I love what " in orange paint and " I 'm doing " in blue . He then dumped the two cans of paint over his head to show " the feeling of a happy , compulsive painter , which I am . " About the same time . Dine began experimenting with " environments , " or " four-sided collages . " <P> After that , Dine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all black or white except for some arbitrary mark or tiny design . " It was a renunciation , " he says , " to get clean . " Finally , he was ready for his present phase . One painting in his current show is called Red Suspenders . It consists of a pair of red suspenders that have been painted over with red paint and fixed against a red background . Says Artist Dine : " I like painting red and red . " The suspenders are not " found objects . " They were bought new for the painting , like a fresh tube of paint . <P> <P> A Necktie Is a Poem . The neckties-some of them are made of paint , while others are real ties painted over-are for Dine " remembered symbols that are important because they keep coming back . I used to write poems in the shape of neckties . " All the paintings , whether of a shoe or hat or necktie , are labeled shoe or hat or necktie , because Dine likes to repeat his theme " over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P>
