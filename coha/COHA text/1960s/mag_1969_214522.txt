When French universities erupted last year , the usually inflexible Charles de Gaulle startled many Frenchmen by declaring that he understood why the students wanted more say in their affairs . Last week Richard Nixon ( who , ironically , was about to visit De Gaulle ) took a very different approach toward campus disorders in the U.S. Despite his trouble establishing rapport with young Americans during his campaign , the President tackled dissident students head on . In a publicly released letter , he lambasted demonstrators in general , giving no hint of any distinction between their valid and invalid aims . <P> Nixon 's letter was to Notre Dame 's President Theodore Hesburgh , and it went out of its way to " applaud " the priest for recently decreeing automatic expulsion after two warnings for any campus demonstrator using force ( TIME , Feb. 28 ) . The President denounced all demonstrators for " grossly " abusing the rights of the majority of students , and accused them of " intolerance of legitimately constituted authority . " Many activists , of course , have stressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , illegitimate . <P> Depopulating the Center . The President ordered Vice President Agnew to meet with the National Governors Conference and explore possible actions at state and federal levels to " cope with the growing lawlessness and violence on our campuses . " The Governors took a middle course , voting approval of Nixon 's stand but rejecting a proposal by California 's Ronald Reagan for a " full " federal investigation of whether the disorders are part of a nationwide plan . New York 's Nelson Rockefeller insisted that disturbances should be handled at the state level without federal intervention where possible . Meantime , Father Hesburgh wrote Agnew urging a Governmental hands-off policy for the present . <P> Many students were disappointed at Nixon 's pronouncement , but few were surprised . " Nixon 's statement shows little understanding of the nature of student grievances , " said Thomas Dawson , a Stanford junior . " The letter does n't deal with the real issue at all , " added John Simpson , editor of the student newspaper at the State University of New York 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is wrong rather than talking about quelling student outbursts . " John Michael , a University of Kansas senior , argued that students would be disillusioned by Nixon 's stand " because it seems to eliminate any form of dissent . " Nixon has " contributed to the polarization of left and right , " declared Roland Trope , a senior at the University of Southern California . " He forces the mid-left and the mid-right to make a choice , and so depopulates the center of its buffers . This is more dangerous than anything else . "
