The nursing staffs and the few physicians on emergency service at the hospitals were drooping with fatigue as the Belgian doctors ' strike dragged into its third week . The wards were jammed with patients , many of whom would normally be treated at home , and , though the emergency service had worked fairly smoothly , spokesmen for the strikers now warned that it would not be continued . Because contagious diseases were sometimes bedded next to others in the crowded hospitals , doctors also warned of imminent epidemics . Belgian husbands with pregnant wives were taking them over the border to France , Holland or West Germany to be sure of obstetrical care . <P> When the government began to draft doctors , they staged a gigantic slowdown , demanding that the army requisition their cars or provide military transport , supply all equipment right down to little black bags . Since 80% of Belgium 's anesthetists are women , and not subject to military service , many operations could not be performed despite the call-up . An army medical officer , one of some 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , declared : " I am ashamed of being a doctor after seeing what is going on here . " At week 's end , two doctors and a technician were charged with the sabotage of a cable supplying electricity for the X-ray room at a Brussels clinic . <P> Premier Theo Lefevre called in the rectors of Belgium 's four universities , ostensibly to talk about nuclear research but actually to discuss the strike . From that point on , the rectors acted as mediators , helped both sides to retreat from impossible positions . The government succeeded in getting the doctors to end the strike before resuming negotiations on the new health-insurance law that had provoked the walkout . <P> Still undecided were the basic issues . The new law established a schedule of fees that doctors could charge under the Belgian health-insurance system , and restricted them to no more than three afternoons a week to see private patients . The doctors are convinced that this law will lower their incomes and oblige them to practice assembly-line medicine , and they insist that government inspection of their records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also fear that the law will lead to uncomfortably accurate auditing of their income-tax returns . <P> All that they have won is the government 's commitment that parts of the law can be modified . As one Brussels newspaper pointed out : " We end up where we should have started . "
