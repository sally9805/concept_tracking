For 54 years , Japan has been a drunkard 's paradise . Public Law 39 , passed in 1907 , declared that a man under the influence of alcohol must be considered to be " temporarily unsound of mind , " thereby exonerating him of legal responsibility for any crimes committed when drunk . As a result , Japan 's tipsy tipplers break store windows , kick dents in car fenders , insult passing women , even commit murder , without fear of lawsuit or punishment . ( One jurist estimates that an average of ten murderers a year go scot-free because of P.L. 39 . ) <P> The Japanese , who are among the world 's politest people when sober , are notoriously violent when drunk . One word for a drunk in Japanese is tora-tiger . The police have been prohibited by the law from taming a tora unless he becomes overtly violent . Even then they could only politely take him into protective custody , put him in a paddy wagon whose walls were padded with foam rubber for his own protection , lock him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . One remedial variation : tape-recording his drunken expostulations , then playing the tape back to his glowering wife when she came to pick up the limp tiger next day . <P> Last week the gates of paradise banged shut . The Japanese Diet voted a bill making the drunk responsible for his acts . Pushed through after three years of lobbying by female Diet members , the bill pointedly allows police to enter private homes at the request of family members beleaguered by a drunk . " What is the world coming to , " cried one Dietman into his beer , " when a man 's own wife can have him arrested merely for beating her up while drunk ? "
