In various editions , John Kennedy 's Profiles in Courage went through 65 printings , sold more than 3,000,000 copies , and hit the bestseller list during three distinct periods : right after it was written , when he was a Senator ; after he was elected President ; and after his assassination . Now a memorial edition seems likely to keep the book in the No. 1 spot for quite a while , and not least of all because of a brother's-eye-view foreword by Attorney General Robert Kennedy . Excerpts : <P> " President Kennedy would be 47 in May . At least one-half of the days that he spent on this earth were days of intense physical pain . When we were growing up together , we used to laugh about the great risk a mosquito took in biting Jack Kennedy-with some of his blood the mosquito was almost sure to die . <P> " I never heard him complain . I never heard him say anything which would indicate that he felt that God had dealt with him unjustly . Those who knew him well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little whiter , the lines around his eyes a little deeper , his words a little sharper . <P> " When he battled against illness , when he fought in the war , when he ran for the Senate , when he stood up against powerful interests in Massachusetts to fight for the St. Lawrence Seaway , when he fought for a labor reform act in 1959 , when he entered the West Virginia primary in 1960 , when he debated Lyndon Johnson at the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles with no preparation , when he took the blame completely on himself for the failure at the Bay of Pigs , when he fought the steel companies , when he stood up at <P> Berlin in 1961 and then again in 1962 for the freedom of that city , when he forced the withdrawal of the Soviet missiles from Cuba , when he spoke and fought for equal rights for all our citizens , and hundreds of other things both big and small , he was reflecting what is the best in the human being . He was demonstrating conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , and true and genuine love for his country . <P> " If there is a lesson from his life and from his death , it is that in this world of ours none of us can afford to be lookers-on , the critics standing on the sidelines . "
