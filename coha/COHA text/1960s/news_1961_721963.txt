txt Congress completed action today on authorizing the basic weapons and manpower increases President Kennedy requested last week . The Administration and Congress were embroiled , however , in a dispute over bomber production . The bomber issue centered on Congressional insistence that more B-52 and B-58 bombers should be produced than President Kennedy has requested . Secretary of Defense Robert S. , in a letter to Senator William Proxmire , reiterated his argument that the bombers are not needed . Senator Proxmire , a Wisconsin Democrat , said that he would oaose extending production of the bombers when the $46,800 , - 000,000 defense appropriations bill comes up in the Senate tomorrow . But Mr. Proxmire is one of the few Administration supporters on this issue in Congress . The Senate and House Armed Services Committees have voted for the bombers . Weapons Bill Passes The House , meanwhile , ap-1 proved without change a $958 , - 570,000 weapons procurement authorization requested by the President in his program to cope with Soviet pressure in Berlin and elsewhere . The House vote was 403 to 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 81 to 0 , on the same measure last Friday . Both House and Senate have approved and the President has signed legislation permitting a call-up of up to 250,000 reservists to active duty . A message of alert was sent yesterday to seventy-one Air National Guard and Air Force ' Reserve units throughout the country to be ready for a possible summons . However , it was indicated at the Pentagon that those who were summoned would get at least thirty days to clear up their private affairs . It was emphasized that no calls to active duty had yet been issued . Some to Go to Europe The expectation , according to official sources , is that some of the reserve units that are called ( i will be sent to Europe . It was also said that members of the units alerted yesterday would do well to assume that they would be called , although not all of them would be called . Pentagon officials said that possible alert messages to reserve units of the ground forces were not yet in preparation and should not be expected immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon , it was indicated , President Kennedy has indicated an armed forces buildup from 2,517,800 men to 2 , - 743,227 , including a 1,000,000-man Army . However , it has also been emphasized here that the policy of increasing conventional military power opposite the Communist forces does not rule out reliance upon nuclear weapons in the event of a conflict , Meanwhile , the Senate Preparedness subconimittee heard secret testimony from Navy officials on the submarine forces of the United States and the Soviet Union . Senator John . ' Stennis , Democrat of Mississippi and chairman of the suticommittee , and Senator Henn ) M. Jackson , Democrat of Washington , said afterward that the United States was still ahead of the Soviet in submarine power . The Senators said that if the Soviet had had a reasonably large number : of **32;1835;TOOLONG , they would have displayed them at the recent naval show at Leningrad . Senator Proxmire brought the bomber dispute into the open again today when he made public the text of a letter from Secretary , in response to his own inquiry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with President Kennedy 's first defense appropriations requests to Congress . Mr. Kennedy , continuing a policy set by the Eisenhower Administration , requested no additional funds for the production of B-52 and B-58 bombers . 1 Production is scheduled to shut down late next year . The President , while expanding the Eisenhower Administration 's program for developing a new bomber , the supersonic , high altitude B-70 , nevertheless rejected Air Force requests and limited his appropriations figure for this purpose to $220 , - 000,000 . This was only enough to produce a few prototypes . Will Not Spend Funds Although Secretary made known that the Administration would not spend the money even if it were appropriated , Air Force leaders appealed for continued bomber production and additional B-70 funds . Gen. Curtis F. LeMay , Chief of Staff of the Air Force , testified before the Senate Defense Appropriations subcommittee on this subject July 18 . General LeMay urged the appropriation of $488,000,000 for the B-70 . He also recommended 4525,000,000 for continued bomber production . Senator A. Willis Robertson , Democrat of Virginia and chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the panel subsequently voted for the extra bomber appropriations . Today . Senator Proximire made public Secretary 's letter . In it , the Secretary said : " I repeat my previously stated opinion that it is not necessary for the Congress to appropriate funds in fiscal year 1962 above Administration requests for B52 and B-58 bombers . Inherent in this is my belief that the production of ** and ** is already adequately " protected " for the period of time involved in our further study of the bomber concept . " Previous appropriations enable us to plan on a very high bomber inventory through the mid-1960 's . In the operational inventory we will have over 700 B-52 's and ** at the end of fiscal year 1966 . Should it be decided later to . maintain this level of heavy bomber aircraft beyond fiscal year 1966 , the request for appropriations can be made several years from now . There appears to be no need to make such a decision before mid-1963 at the earliest . The risk involved in delaying the decision is not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial risk fully justified by the remoteness of the possibility of having to exercise the option and pay the ' restart cost ' penalty .
