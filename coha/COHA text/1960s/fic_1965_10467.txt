Heights swimming pool . It was only March and the pool was still deserted . I thought I heard someone knock behind the gate . Had Father Finnocchino 's dwarfs come back to haunt the pool ? An enormous rat burrowed its swollen head between the bars of the gate . Crazy challenged the rat . His lips creased near the corners of his mouth , and I could n't tell whether Crazy was smiling or not . " My job , " he said . " Father used to let me chase the rats . " He removed his tobacco pouch and a slip of yellow paper . " Crazy , can I have one too ? " He rolled a cigarette for himself and then handed me the pouch . I tried to copy Crazy , but the tobacco spilled on my shoe and the cigarette refused to roll . I clacked my tongue wearily . " Gim me , " Crazy said , and shaping the paper with two fingers , he rolled the cigarette for me . He struck a match against the back pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cigarette seemed to light before the match had had a chance to flare . Then , cupping one hand over the match , he helped me light my cigarette . " Puff , " he said . " Puff . " The tobacco tasted bitter , and I tried to keep myself from coughing . I inhaled accidentally , and began to choke . Crazy smacked my back several times . My eyes were already tearing , but I felt a little better . I tried the cigarette again . He started to put away the tobacco pouch , but then he reconsidered , and after tightening the strings , he offered me the pouch and all his cigarette paper . " Here , take it . " He raised his hat brim , exposing both his eyes . " I got ta go , " he said . I wanted to hold him for a few more moments , so I said , " Crazy , Crazy , what are you going to do when you get out of the Army ? " " Me ? " Crazy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nick . A thirty-year man . " 40He crossed the street defiantly , halting several cars , and walked towards the IRT . A man in one of the cars asked me if Crazy was supposed to be a Texas Ranger . " Where 's his six shooters , hey ? " I ignored him and waved to Crazy . Crazy touched the peak of his hat , but he did n't wave back . I put the tobacco pouch in my pocket and walked along Broadway for a little while. 41-Ea CHAPTER DIThe Germans happened to overrun Poland at an inconvenienttime : our school was planning a massive pilgrimage to the World 's Fair , and now the lower termers were beginning to panic . They thought La Guardia might close the Fair and disembowel the Trylon and the Parachute Tower . Most of the seniors scoffed at the French and the Germans , but it was n't because of the Fair . We stood opposite the row of porcelain urinals inside the second floor john and bemoaned our individual fates . Howie Rosenthal was sure that there was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , smoking and peeing at the same time , " we 're all gon na be screwed . You 'll see . " I watched Howie 's words register on the gloom-ridden faces crowding the urinals . " Screwed . " I wondered if his urinal were actually some sort of oracle . My relationship with Howie had changed drastically after I was appointed editor of the literary magazine . He besieged me with whole42folios of poems which recorded , in veiled terms , every stage in his protracted romance with Sharon Lipsky . And in order to hold him off , I agreed to accept for the magazine one harmlesslittle poem which described a ping-pong match between Sharon and himself , and which I privately enjoyed because I could always visualize Sharon 's bouncing nipples as she retrievedthe ping-pong balls . When the poem appeared , Howie immediately made me vice president and treasurer of the chess and checkers club , and invited me to attend the select after-lunch sessions inside the second floor john . Moskowitz , the assistant principal , often patrolled the halls during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stooges near the water fountain outside the john . " We do n't wan na get into trouble with Uncle Nate , " Howie would say , winking malignantly . " No , not Uncle Nate . " Everybodyat G.W. knew that Moskowitz 's uncle ran a reform school somewhere upstate , and during the senior assemblies , Moskowitz would invariably warn us that we were all prospectivecandidates for Uncle Nate 's . " Shape up , " he would say , " before you all get shipped out . " Of course , Howie had his own theories about Uncle Nate . " It 's a fraud , the whole reform school bit . There ai n't no Uncle Nate . " But he still ' kept his stooge outside the john . And on this particular day , Howie had hardly finished peeing when the stooge happened to knock . " The fuzz , " he said , " the fuzz , " and after flinging his cigarette behind the radiator , he and Archie Finkleberg , the captain of the football team , locked themselves inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to capturing a stall for myself and I usually ended up inside the one with the missing door and the broken toilet seat . And so , with Moskowitz jumping around , I had to pull down my pants , lean my elbows reflectively on my knees , and pretend that I was crapping , while my ass almost froze kissing the porcelain rim of the pot. 43The minute Moskowitz came through the door he saw me squatting on my pot . I could feel my buttocks harden . The corners of his eyes crinkled noticeably . " Nick , " he said softly , as if he did n't want to interrupt the rhythm of my bowel movements . " How 's Dad ? " " Fine , " I said , " fine . He should be walking around soon , and we 're hoping that he 'll be back at school before the end of the year . " My father still had some trouble speaking , and in the midst of the most random conversations he would often stammer confusedly ; but he was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still with us in spite of my father 's constant protestations , was teaching him how to walk with a cane . After he inspected every urinal , Moskowitz lingered outside my stall , and then left . We waited for the stooge 's signal . When he knocked rapidly three times , we came out of our stalls . Howie congratulated me . Everybody agreed that I knew how to handle " the fuzz . " I stopped off at the bake shop near school and bought a baked Alaska for my father and an apple turnover for Mrs. Rumplemeyer , hoping that the pastry would mellow both of them and establish a temporary truce . When I came home I found Mrs. Rumplemeyer outside the door . Dark blotches streaked the sides of her dress , resembling enormous ink blots . Gripping my hand sturdily , she told me that my father had had another stroke and had been taken to the hospital . I 'm sure her pinched smile was neither forced nor practiced , but I could hardly condemn her for having become slightly accustomed to grief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hairless legs of dying men . I gave her the turnover and the baked Alaska . My father was in a coma for two days and died without regaining consciousness . The sisters who watched him constantlytold me that he never even opened his eyes . I knew44that if Aunt Giuseppina got her hands on him now she would have her embalmers paint his face and put him through one of her marathon wakes surrounded by hysterical , breastbeatingwomen . Then there would have been the inevitable Requiem and the elaborate burial , all of which , I was sure , my father would have protested , dead or alive . I did n't want to see my father 's flesh devoured piecemeal by her neatly packagedrituals and rites . And so , without telling a soul , I arranged for my father 's burial . I contacted a Jewish undertaker , who , after hearing my plight , must have convinced himself that my father was a fallen bootlegger , because he offered to bury him at a reduced rate , " no questions asked . " My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from school and went to the movies practically every day , sometimes riding all the way over to PineappleStreet in order to track down Boston Blackie or Charlie Chan . I fell in love with Eric Von Stroheim , and hissed incessantlyat Kenny Baker and Bobby Breen . I even managed to avoid Aunt Giuseppina . Whenever I saw her approach the court , I ran up to the roof or hid out at the RKO Coliseum . Once , after barely escaping Aunt Giuseppina and spending the whole afternoon at the Coliseum watching Hitler 's troops monopolize the News of the Week , I came home and sat triumphantlyin the kitchen , playing with the tobacco pouch that Crazy had given me two years before , which I refilled every now and then with the thick tobacco from one of my father 's bins . I rolled a cigarette for myself , the paper bulging unevenly at both ends . I moved into the living room and sat down near my father 's pipe racks . With the smoke rising dreamily from my lumpy cigarette , I felt like some great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . I did not need any visions or supernatural signs : my father , I was absolutely certain , approved all my moves . The next morning I woke with a terrible cough . I thought45that my father 's tobacco might have clogged my throat , and I put away the pouch for three days . But the cough persisted . Envisioning huge , purple lesions on both my lungs , I went to the chest clinic at Saint Joseph 's . After demonstrating my cough to the doctor at the clinic , and telling him that one of my lungs had collapsed when I was seven , he began tapping my knees with a little metal hammer . I asked him if I would have to give up smoking . " No , " he said , feeling my scrimpy calves . Then he asked me what kind of work I did . I told him that I was still attending high school , that my father had just died , and that he had owned two houses on Manhatten Avenueand had left me an annuity , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to work for the next five or six years . " I suppose I 'll do some kind of writing eventually , " I said . " But what about my chest ? " He gave me a large bottle filled with a blebby pink syrup , and told me to take five or six spoonfuls every day , and that any druggist would refill the bottle for me as many times as I wanted . I did n't have much faith in the syrup , but I drank three bottles anyway , and after a while the cough went away . I became fed up hiding out at the RKO Coliseum , and so , one day , about three weeks after my father died , I got up early and went back to school . Moskowitz had caught Howie squeezing Sharon Lipsky 's tits in the hall and had suspended him for three weeks . Howie was hardly nonplused by Moskowitz'sedicts : instead of waiting out his three week exile at home , he spent all his mornings inside the second floor john . But Howie lost Sharon while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in November wearing a heart-shaped diamond ring : she was engaged to a balding , thirty-seven-year-old accountantwho had a roadster with a rumble seat and a big nose . She had been seeing him on the sly for about three months . Howie told everybody that the accountant could bang her in46the rumble seat for all he cared : he did n't give " two shits for Sharon . " Two shits or not , Sharon left school in midwinter and married her accountant . I suppose she already had a hunch that the coming war would remove most of the availablemen , and she was n't taking any chances . " Two months , " Howie said . " I give her two months with that bum , and then she 'll come running . Any schmuck can buy a roadster . " " Two months , " we said , playing our parts determinedly , but we knew that it was a lost cause . The same month Sharon was married I received a card from Crazy Bemelman . He said that he was sorry to hear about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four months , but I figured that it must take a pretty long time for news to travel from New York to Missouri , and anyway , I was glad to hear from Crazy ; I saved his card . Crazy had been in the Army for over two years and was still a private , and when his mother saw that they would never make him an officer , she began to fume at Roosevelt , the Army , and the Jews . She even began to suspect the Church . She claimed that Archbishop Spellman had made a pact with Rabbi Wise and the War Department : from now on the kikes would control all the NCO Schools and the Officer Training Schools in the Infantry , the Cavalry , and the Air Corps . She joined the German-American Bund , and told everybody that in the German Army every soldier had an equal chance . She threw away her beads and hailed Hitler as the new Messiah . It was frightening hearing her heil Hitlers in the halls , and she even taught a few of the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazi salute . When she began making arm bands for the boys with gold swastikas embroidered on them , the mothers in our building rebelled and broke up her little army . She retreated to the basement and rode her husband mercilessly . She called him a kike and a stooge for ! I47 " King Roosevelt . " Mr. Bemelman only hunched his shoulders deeper and shoveled coal . I still made him an occasional bolognasandwich . I 'm sure Mrs. Bemelman rejoiced when the Germans flew over Belgium in gliders and captured bridges and forts , but I lowie Rosenthal became more and more morose : he expected the gliders to land on his roof any day . " Sure , " he told me and Archie Finkelberg , " fifty gliders could take New York , easy ! They could cross over the Atlantic in five days , and with a few smoke bombs , no one would see a thing . " The Fink and I did n't bother arguing with him ; we were grateful that the gliders were taking his mind off Sharon . Howie watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when the gliders still did n't show up , he calmed down a little . " Can I help it if Hitler ai n't as smart as I thought he was ? If he wants to miss a perfect chance , that 's up to him . " But he was still worried about Roosevelt . " Roosey'sgonna suck us into the war , you 'll see . " Even though G.W. had lost every game last year , Finkelbergmade All City and the coaches secured a football scholarship for him at Penn State . Howie lashed at him . " I mean , the guy 's so dumb it takes him an hour to spell out his name , and now all he has to do is join the ROTC at Penn State , and he has it made . He 'll sit out the whole war . And what about me ? You think I can get into any college ? I 'm on Moskowitz 's shit list . " The Fink complained bitterly . " Everybody blames me ! " I thought he was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't put my ass on the line for that scholarship ? " He showed Howie his chipped teeth and his broken eyebrows . " And who failed four subjects , you or me ? " Howie stormed over to the Fink . " You expect me to pass when the fuzz suspended me for three weeks ? " Finkelberg relented a little . " What do you want from48my life ? Why do n't you put a little of the blame on Nick ? He 's Moskowitz 's golden boy , ai n't he ? " " Nick 's all right , " Howie said . " And if the fuzz likes him , that ai n't his fault . And he do n't have to worry about getting shoved into the Army . He 's got a dead lung . Show him , Nick . " I wheezed for the Fink a couple of times . I felt a little guilty about my constricted chest , and I said , " maybe it will heal in a year or two . " When Moskowitz found out that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his office . He had me sit down , then leaning over his desk , his jowls wagging over my head , he began to shout . " Do you want to end up behind the counterat Gimbel 's ? A rag collector , a nobody ? Nick , with your talent and potential ? " His hairy knuckles bunched angrily and I drew my head back . " I know , it 's that imp , that little Hitler , Rosenthal , he 's behind everything . He told you not to apply , just to irk me . I should have shipped him out to Uncle Nate years ago . " Keeping my head at a comfortable distance from his knuckles , I told him flatly that Howie Rosenthal was my only friend at G.W. , but that he had absolutely nothing to do with my decision to stay away from colleges . I know I should have also told him that I was tired of being George Washington 's wonder boy , of winning spelling bees and essay contests , of hearing about his Uncle Nate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face for four years and listen to his own brand of carbonated bullcrap , but , of course , I did n't want to spur his hairy knuckles into action . I just told him that I wanted to take a rest for a year or two . He recalled his knuckles and crumpled the corners of his eyes . " I know , " he said , " I know . " He told me that my father had been a wonderful man and a faithful colleague  --  actually , it was my father who had first dubbed Moskowitz the warden of the shithouses  --  but that I was taking his death too hard , that I should consider him my49pal , and that he would take me golfing if I wanted . I thanked him and left the office . One evening in May Howie captured me and whisked me over to the IRT : he was going to raid a fraternity party at Columbia , and he wanted me to go with him . Howie coached me while we waited for the train . " Remember , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to i r 6th Street . Ilowie lit a cigarette and inhaled cautiously . " Let 's go , " he said , " let 's go . " We paused in front of a brownstone on i 15th Street . There was a shield over the door with an enormous omega emblazoned on it ; a handpainted eye loomed between the curled ends of the omega . " Hot stuff , " Howie said , sucking his cigarette sourly . " Well , why did you want to come ? " I said , unable to stare back at the eye . " You kidding ? They got a harem inside . " Two boys wearing identical tweed coats with wide lapels approached the brownstone ; they looked about fourteen years old ; they were both smoking pipes with deep , furrowed bowls . " Is Sonia Dubinsky coming ? " the first one asked . " I hear she puts out for whole battalions at a time . " Howie winked secretly . " I know , " the second one said . He was carrying a book under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Braverman says it 's no fun inviting her more than once . He warned me to come pre-pared . " Howie trampled his cigarette and we followed them up the stairs . We walked through a creaky , uncarpeted hallway and entered a large unfurnished room . Howie whispered to me . " Do n't worry , the couches must be upstairs . Remember , Alpha Alpha Gamma . " No one challenged us . Howie seemed a little disappointed . There were about twenty boys in the room ; they all wore coats with wide lapels , and they had very clean faces . Most of the boys were crowded around a girl with50painted eyes who stood against the wall , her breasts raised defiantly . " Wow , " Howie said . " I bet you can walk right up and kiss her nipples . " He wagged his head  --  " Sonia , Sonia "  --  and joined the boys . There was only one other girl in the room ; standing alone near the window , she wore a dark , shapeless sweater . Her face seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair was plaited over her ears like thickly stranded rope . She had hazel-colored eyes . I could tell right away that she was totally titless . Every time she sucked in air her nipples would cling hungrily to her sweater . I smiled and she did n't turn her head away . " Sonia Dubinsky , " I told myself infallibly , walkingover to the window . She asked me point-blank if I went to Columbia . Even if I had n't already forgotten Howie 's magic formula of alphas and gammas , I still would n't have been able to lie : her hazel eyes seemed ready to pierce through any equivocation . I told her that I was a senior at G.W. , and that I did n't even intend to go to college . " Good , " she said , " I hate these Columbia queers . " Her name , she said , was Sonia Rubinsky . " Dubinsky , Rubinsky , " I argued reasonably with myself , " what difference does it make ? As long as the Sonia is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was majoring in political science . Gorky was her favorite writer . And after she told me three or four times that all fraternity parties were for drippy little mama 's boys who liked to keep rearranging wooden blocks with the letters S-E-X painted on them , but could n't really do anything else , I asked her if she wanted to leave . I was amazed at my own boldness . " Yes , " she said , flexing her marvelous jaw , and she led me over to the door . I felt a little guilty about abandoning Howie , but he had already broken through the ring of boys and was nuzzling the girl with the defiant breasts , and I knew that he could take care of himself. 51When I told her that I lived alone , Sonia offered to come over to my place . She did n't waste any time on preliminaries once we arrived there . Sitting on my bed , her tongue flicking in my throat , she began taking off my shirt . I had some trouble with her brassiere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superfluous . Her nipples seemed stranded on her vacant chest like two useless buttons . I suckled them greedily , but even then , her breasts refused to rise . Sonia apologized . " Sorry , " she said , " the toy department is on the fifth floor , " and then , reaching over , she removed a packet from her pocketbook . " Free love is fine , " she said quizzically , " but I 'm still a little old-fashioned . There 's nothing wrong with planned parenthood . " It was the same kind of packet that Crazy had shown me two years ago . " Well ? Do you want me to put it on for you ? " I walked over to the bathroom . Sonia became suspicious after I closed the door . " God , " she said , peeking in , " have n't you ever used a pro ? " Her nipples wagged all the while she laughed . In the morning Sonia announced that she was moving in with me . " I like the setup here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed in any sort of propriety ; it 's just that she seemed so unbelievably bold . " Wo n't your mother and father say something ? " Her jaw sagged sullenly for the first time , and even her hazel eyes seemed to cloud . " My mother 's a first-class bitch . My father would move out too , if he only had half the chance . It 's already settled . You 'll help me pack in the afternoon . " As soon as Sonia moved in , I became a minor celebrity at G.W. It seems that I was the only senior in the whole school who had his own shackjob . Howie was furious . His status at school rapidly declined . He called Sonia " the titless wonder , " but nobody listened to him . A shackjob 's a shackjob , titless52or not : it was as simple as that . He would stand outside one of the johns and badger whoever happened to pass . " You think I couldn'ta grabbed Titless myself ? And who told him about Alpha Alpha Gamma in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really shacking up with him ? I 'm telling you , Nick 's cherry . Ask him yourself . " Half the senior class congregated around my lunch table while I publicly unwrapped the sandwiches that Sonia prepared for me . Howie sat abandoned at his corner of the table , but even he bugged out one eye when he saw me display my own plastic salt shaker and the neatly pared celery stalks and carrot heads which I placed side by side in the middle of the table . " Nick , " the Fink would say , ignoring Howie , " what 's it like getting it every night ? " And after tipping the salt shaker gently over the celery stalks , I would screw up one eye expertlyand say , " Come over and I 'll give you a demonstration . " But in spite of all the publicity , having a shackjob turned out to be a real pain in the ass . I had trouble with Sonia from the start . She dragged me down to Union Square every other day , and surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours about Stalin and the Popular Front . If one of the five cent philosophers from the other end of the Square happened to heckle her , she would shout , " Shitface , " " Fascist , " and " Stooge , " while the asthmatic cats purred brokenly , and I collected Eskimo Pie sticks and built magnificent forts behind the benches with the missing slats . After the ordeal at Union Square , we invariably ended up at the Stanley , and sucking whole mouthfuls of jujubes , I had to sit through one Soviet film after the other . Sonia had been a member of the Young Communist League for years , and she told me about her meetings and her rallies . " I never did any Jimmy Higgins work , " she would say , her jaw jutting proudly , " I was strictly agit-prop . We53made Robin Hood and his Merry Men look like pansies with zoot suits . " Then she would tell me about all the exploits of her marvelous band . She had raided the headquarters of the Young Socialist League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced the local newsdealers to distribute the Daily Worker ; she had fought the bloodsucking landlords on her block and helped the dispossessed tenants bring up their furniture from the street ; and when her local A &; P failed to hire any Negroes , she spearheaded a sneak attack during which she broke three coffee grinders and scattered Grape Nuts across every aisle . " Match that , " she said , " match that . " When I told her that I had done nothing more exceptionalthan raid the Fort Washington Y once , she began to accuse me . " You know , Nick , " she said , " the trouble with you is that you have n't seen anything or done anything . You 're blind to everything that 's around you . My God , did n't your father ever take you any place , or talk to you about anything ? I would n't even mind if you were a Fascist . Then at least I could expose you . But you 're nothing , you have n't got an idea in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And after telling me that she was going to crack open my shell and show me a little bit of the world , she took me on a tour of the Bronx . We boarded the Boston Road trolley and rode past row after row of identically cramped houses with narrow windowsand sunken stoops . Men with battered hats and dark , sullen faces sat on the stoops , beer bottles bunched near their toes . Huge mounds of garbage were heaped regularly on both sides of the tracks , with broken crib posts peering over cartonswith collapsed sides , mattress springs with distended coils , maimed lamp shades , and headless dolls . A crippled boy with an Indian hat and a moronic smile stood on one of the mounds and threw balls of dried horse shit at Sonia and me . I waved to him . Sonia began lecturing me . " This , " she said , 54pointing to the mound , " this is what we 're fighting for . So landlords wo n't be able to dump their garbage in the street . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bage disposal units in Moscow , and how Stalin had declared war on all the rats and lice in Russia . I kept thinking of the crippled boy . I wanted to stand on the mound with him and challenge the passing trolley cars . I know I would have wound up a creditable shit flinger . After the first few weeks Sonia stopped packing my lunches . Instead of pared celery stalks and carrots , I came to school with lumpy peanut butter sandwiches . Even the Fink could sense my disappointment . " You ai n't wetting your pecker every night , huh Nicky boy ? " Howie did n't bother gloating : he had his own troubles . Moskowitz was n't going to let him graduate . " Screw the academics . The fuzz wo n't even throw me a general diploma . " He stared darkly at me and the Fink . " Everybody 's got it knocked , but I always end up with the dreck . " Howie disappeared the first week in June . Moskowitz sent the truant officers after him , but nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Broadway , but Howie stayed away from all his old hangouts . There had been reports that someone wearing a blue cap kept feeling up twelve-year- old girls at the RKO Coliseum during the Saturday matinees , and even though I knew that the twelve-year-old girls were only trying to get some attention for themselves , I still wanted to inspect the Coliseum . Maybe Howie was hiding out in the balcony , living on old candy bars ? But Sonia kept tabs on my time , and she would n't even allow me a free hour . She was still out to educate me . Howie showed up outside my door on the Sunday before graduation . Sonia was still sleeping . " Shh , " I told him , " shh . " His shirt was torn , his elbows were black , and his cheeks were sucked in . I sneaked him into the kitchen and made him seven55peanut butter sandwiches . " Wake the bitch up , " he demanded mildly , " I want some celery stalks . " " She 'll kill us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the peanut butter . " He wanted me to roll him a bundle of cigarettes . " A week 's supply , " he said . I showed him my empty tobacco pouch . " Sonia 's allergic to smoke . " " Jesus Christ , " he said , finishing his fifth sandwich , " what kind of broad did you line yourself up with ? Do you have to have her permission to take a crap too ? " I turned the pouch inside out . " Where the hell have you been ? I thought maybe you were hiding out at the Coliseum ? " " You kidding ? I ai n't no lousy werewolf . I ca n't live all the time in the dark . I been hanging around this carnival at Pelham . " " Where do you sleep ? " " Under the ferris wheel , " he said , flexing his elbows proudly . He talked about " shills " and " aces " and " monkey pie , " and told me that he was a " bona fide carnival bum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One thing , " he said , poising one eyebrow slowly , " you got ta know how to handle the queers . The guys who run the stands are all half queer . " He removed from his pocket a wooden block that was wound with chicken wire . " Better than a blackjack , " he said , gripping the block . " It keeps off the swishes . " I noticed a bruise on his neck . He jabbed the air fiercely , smashing imaginary noses and gouging out imaginary eyes . " Do n't think I 'm looking for any sympathy , Nick . I appreciatethe sandwiches , but that 's not what I came for . I need some jack . The carnival 's moving to Philly on Thursday , and I 'm moving with it . Once we get there I know they 'll need an extra shill . " The rent money was sitting in a dish on the shelf over Howie 's head . I looked at Howie quizzingly before I decided56to take down the dish and offer him the money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howie counted the crisp ten dollar bills . " You sure you can afford it , Nick ? I do n't want no money you ca n't afford . " " I 'm sure , " I said , staring at his black elbows and cursing myself now for having offered the money reluctantly . " Wait , I can get you some more . " I walked quietly into the bedroom . Sonia was snoring . I removed an old stocking half filled with quarters that I had stored behind my dresser : emergency money , quarters that I had saved religiously since I was five . Howie had known about the stocking . He did n't want to take the money . " Go ' head , " I said , " what the hell am I going to do with a sack of quarters ? " Howie tied a knot at the end of the stocking , and then threw the stocking into his pocket , together with the wooden block . He began to walk a little lopsided . " Thanks , Nick , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay you back . Howie Rosenthal do n't forget the people who hurt him and the people who help him . The fuzz gets paid back too .

So if you get a letter from Flash Gordon or Phil Fu Manchu , you 'll know who it 's from . " His left elbow began to shake ; he steadied the elbow with his other hand . His eyebrows worked unevenly . He wanted me to come with him to Philadelphia . " You can take Titless too ! Sure , we can work up some kind of juggling act , or take over one of the concessions . What do you say , Nick ? " I shrugged one shoulder unconvincingly . " I do n't think so , Howie . I never liked carnivals . " His elbow began shaking again . " Howie , why do n't you stick around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get Moskowitz to give you some kind of diploma ? You do n't have to go home . I can put you up here .

The kid can take care of himself . " He tapped the stocking and the wooden block ; the quarters in his pocket jingled hollowly . " See you , Nick . " I walked him over to the door . " Howie , lemme make you a few more sandwiches . " " Na , " he said , " I ai n't got the time . They need me back at the carnival . Take care , Nick , and show your bitch who 's the boss .

Mrs. Bemelman glared at us when we passed her in the hall , and she no longer told me anything about Crazy , but there was still no talk about having us dispossessed . She was much too busy to bother with us . She attended all the rallies of the GermanAmericanBund , and played her recordings of Hitler 's Reichstagspeeches through the night . More than once I was woken by frenized shouts of " Sig bell , sig heil , sig heil . " After Hitler captured Paris and began to talk of walking over the English Channel , Mrs. Bemelman denounced Churchill and his Jewish Parliament , and warned that Roosevelthad better come to terms with her Fiihrer , or there would soon be a day of reckoning for all Americans . She would often stand in the middle of the court and rant for hours . There was some talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , but no one followed through . She was still the dispenser of steam and hot water , and most of us knew that the proper functioning of our toilets and dumbwaiters depended58directly on Mrs. Bemelman 's good will . But in November , just a month before the outbreak of the war , Mrs. Bemelman began painting enormous swastikas in the halls , most of the kids in our building mistaking them for the mark of Zorro . Then , after she transferred her swastikas to the windows of the shops on Fort Washington Avenue and added the words " Judea Verboten " over the swastikas , and even smashed a few of the windows , she was arrested and later taken to Bellevue for observation . She never returned to the court . Mr. Bemelman visited her practically every day , but now his shoulders seemed unburdened , and he began tending the bushes in the court . I would have invited him upstairs , but Sonia had never cared for Mr. Bemelman . She called him " The Nazi " and claimed that he was the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear regularly now on Cabrini Boulevard . Some came with cameras and ranged Fort Tryon Park . Even Nellie Wasserman , whose father was the chancellor of the Washington Heights Merchants ' Association , was hanging around with a private from Fort Dix . The peacetime draft had made the Army somewhat respectable . All the kids in the neighborhood made up their own selective service numbers and boasted of having their own draft cards . The storekeepers waved to the soldiers and the kids saluted them . None of the soldiers I saw wore campaign hats ; most of them wore caps with gold shields and shiny leather bills . I had meant all along to ask Mr. Bemelman how Crazy was making out , and then , during the last week in November , there was a small notice inthe Post : SERVICEMAN FROM NEW YORK AREA DIES IN FREAK ACCIDENT . Crazy had been killed by a runaway tank during maneuversat Fort Riley in Kansas . The tank had been manned by a rookie crew . The Post claimed that there would be some sort of investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first casualty of the war . I showed the notice to Sonia . She said59that this would never have happened in the Red Army . She thought that the individual members of the tank crew should be crucified or shot . Mr. Bemelman came up to see me a few days after the accident . He stood outside the door holding Crazy 's old campaignhat . The peak was caved in , and the brim was crusted with soot and dust . Mr. Bemelman 's hand shook . His whole face seemed shrunken . " Please , Mr. Bemelman , come in . " He saw Sonia sitting in the kitchen . She was leaning against the window sill , both knees showing . " No , " he said , looking down . " Thanks , Nick . The dumbwaiterbroke , and I have to fix the cables . " I noticed for the first time that his left ear was larger than the right . He gave me Crazy 's hat . " I was going through Irwin 's belongings , and I thought you might want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me you liked his hat . " He left then before I could thank him , the banister already hiding his narrow back . I tried on the hat without reshaping the peak or dusting the brim . It rode unhampered down to my chin . I raised the left side of the hat , exposing one eye , an ear , and part of my nose . Sonia saw me from the kitchen . She gripped her knees and began to cackle . " What an awful , silly hat , " she said finally , " what an awful , silly hat . " I walked downstairs without closing the door . Even from the court I could hear her cackling . The hat kept sinking lower and lower , and I had to maneuver the brim . The kids who were playing slapball in the court held up their game when I crossed over their chalked bases . They all wanted to try on the hat . I almost bumped into a woman who had just come out of Gristede 's hugging a sack of grapefruits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I walked down to Fort Washington Avenue . I convinced myself that Crazy 's hat had all sorts of magical properties , that while wearing it I could commune with Crazy 's ghost , and maybe with Howie in Phil-60adelphia , or even with Father Finnocchino 's hunchbacks and dwarfs . A sailor came out of the bar near the corner and broke my reverie : he wanted to trade hats . I glared at him and kept walking . About a month after the bombing of Pearl Harbor , Sonia 's father moved in with us . He arrived one night with two shoppingbags and a suitcase and told us that his wife had kicked him out . He promptly took out his handkerchief and started to cry . " I told you my mother 's a bitch , " Sonia said , but she did n't seem particularly pleased to see her father . He pleaded with Sonia to allow him to stay . " Just for a little while , " he said , still holding the handkerchief , " until I can get settled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , Sonia deferred to me . " You 'll have to ask Nick , " she said . " It 's his place . " He wiggled his ears for me and blew his nose weakly , and I helped him bring in the shopping bags . But within a week I began to realize that Sonia 's mother was probably my only ally . Mr. Rubinsky was a pot-bellied little man who talked incessantlyabout the Spanish Civil War and the Lincoln Brigade . " If it had n't have been for my damn leg , " he would always end up saying , " I would have gone over with the Lincoln in ' 36 . Ask anybody . It was the leg . " Then he limped for us and called Franco a puta and a maricon and told us about the John Brown Battery and the Garibaldi Battalion and the P.O.U.M. and Tarragona , where , he said , the Lincoln Brigade had trained . " I knew all their moves . I always had an official report . " And he would offer to give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even Sonia grew tired of his commentaries and she would often halt him in the middle of a battle . " Can it , " she would say . He would shrug one shoulder awkwardly , sit on his suitcase , and promise to keep his mouth shut during his entiretenure at my place , which , I was beginning to see , was likely to be lifelong. 61I suffered through the summer and most of the fall with Sonia and her father . I often wondered to myself why I did n't throw them both out on their butts which had already been buttered and fattened at my expense . And even though I planned magnificent schemes , I was paralyzed in some way and could n't act . Maybe I just did n't want to live alone . After a while Sonia took her father with her on her excursions to Union Square , and she left me pretty much alone . I would read in the mornings and play slapball later with the kids in the court , and maybe hike over to the zoo and draw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without Sonia around to plague me , I usually had something to do . It was in the evenings that Sonia made most of the trouble . If she had already seen the films at the Stanley , or was too lazy to attend the lectures at the Seaman 's Institute or the 92nd Street Y , she would sit home and begin to probe me . " You 're a freak , Nick , " she would say , " and I 'm going to find out why . " And when I told her about my father , and that I could n't remember anything about my mother , she would draw in her chin excitedly , and say , " There 's something fishy about the whole thing . I 'll bet your father was a secret lech , or maybe a queer . Did he ever bring up any of his students ? " And then her father would help her rummage through my father 's belongings . " We 'll have the story soon . Do n't worry . Just one letter or a snapshot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes . " But all they ever uncoveredwas Crazy 's campaign hat which I had hid in one of my father 's drawers . One evening , late in 1942 , while Sonia and her father were at the Stanley , I decided to eat Chinese food at the Shanghai Palace on Broadway . While I walked towards Fort WashingtonAvenue , I heard the air-raid sirens wail torturously overhead . I figured I 'd sit out the alert at the Shanghai , but an air-raid warden reprimanded me immediately . " This is no picnic , " he said . " The shelter 's over there . " The chin straps of62his helmet were loose and kept slapping his chest . His jowls wagged continuously . It was Moskowitz . " Nick , " he said , " Nick , " recognizing me . And he followed me over to the shelter , which happened to be a tiny cellar under Fort WashingtonAvenue . Several bicycles without fenders were pressed against one wall . I could hear the rats shuttle between the wheels of the bicycles . Moskowitz poked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam and kept jumping through the spokes . " It would n't be such a bad idea , " he said , " if the Nazis bombed this place . " He turned off the flashlight and we stood in the dark . The sirens kept wailing . A woman and a little boy came into the room . The boy was wearing a pint-sized helmet and combat boots . He saluted Moskowitz and stuck his tongue out at me . I wondered how he would have reacted had I worn Crazy 's hat . " He 's a little soldier , " the womansaid . " His father 's in the Pacific . " He charged the bicycles and chased after the rats . " We 'll need all the soldiers we can find , " Moskowitz said ; I do n't think he meant to slight me . More out of spite than anything else , I asked him : " How is Uncle Nate ? " " Fine , fine , " he said , and proceeded to catalog Uncle Nate 's methods for controlling delinquent boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of them are orphans , most of them come from the Bronx . Troublemakers , but Nate keeps them in line . " He dipped his head slightly and the rim of his helmet hid his nose . " You know , Nick , " he said , " Uncle Nate could use somebody with your talents up there . Nick , you 'd be a natural . You would n't even need a teaching certificate . Where can you find teachers today ? " We heard several loud thuds : the little boy was bombarding the rats with his helmet . The woman called to him , " Rudy , Rudy , you 'll soil your boots . " I told Moskowitz that I did n't feel like moving upstate , but that I would let him know if I changed my mind . I could imaginemyself telling Howie I was working for Uncle Nate ! The63sirens had stopped wailing , and I moved towards the entrance of the cellar . Moskowitz rolled up his arm band hurriedly and blocked my way . " The alert is n't over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His chin straps had tangled under his jowls . When I came home later I found Mr. Rubinsky trying on my father 's suits . He had rolled up all the cuffs and the sleeves for the occasion . " Not bad , " he said . " With a little alterationI 'll have a complete outfit . " Sonia was with him : she was wearing Crazy 's hat . " Nick , " she said , saluting me , " we 're organizing the Cabrini Boulevard Patrol . Captain Nick 's Army . " I sat in the kitchen . There were some empty beer bottles under the sink . " Nick , " she said , " Nick , do n't you want to inspect your patrol . Nick . . . . " Sonia and her father slept on the sofa in the living room . They had covered each other with my father 's suits . Sonia snored doggedly through one nostril , and her father kept chewing his gums . I stuffed three shirts and a suit into my father 's battered grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Crazy 's hat . I said goodbye to the kitchen , listened to Sonia snore for a minute and gathered some additionalcourage , then I went downstairs , found a drug store that was still open , and called Moskowitz . " Who ? " he said . " What ? Who 's calling so late ? " " Nick , " I told him , " Nick . Does your Uncle Nate still need a teacher ? " " Nick , " he said parochially , " hasty decisions only brew trouble . Call me back tomorrow . Then I 'll talk to Uncle Nate . " " No , " I said . " Tomorrow is no good . " I knew I would never be able to screw up enough courage if I waited until the morning , and I would be stuck with Sonia and her father for life . " It has to be now , " I said , frantically . " Now . " " Okay , Mr. Impatience , it 's settled . I do all the recruiting for Uncle Nate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and School for Wayward Jewish Boys . Nick , you 're a fortunate young man . Hasty or not , this is one decision that will turn out in your favor . Uncle Nate  --  " " No snow jobs , Mr. Moskowitz , please . I 've already bought the product . Just tell me how to get up there . " I was going to wear Crazy 's hat in the telephone booth , but I did n't want any of the countermen to become suspicious , so I decided to take out the tobacco pouch instead . My jockstrapspilled out of the grip . I leaned over and tried to pick it up , but my head bumped against the wall of the booth . " Blattenburg , " I said , " Blattenburg . " I could n't locate the pouch. 65to CHAPTER DiThe train had remained in the station for almost an hour , and when a woman at the other end of the car complained to the conductor , he gave her vague answers about troop movementsand wartime conditions . She was n't satisfied until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sabotage , and that there might be a bomb on the train . She immediately looked under her seat . Then , glancing systematically at all the passengers and property in the car , her eyes finally settled on my grip , which I was carrying on my knees , one of the handles having already broken off . I did n't want to become part of her little drama , and so , trying to look as inconspicuous as possible , I molded the bumps on the grip with one knee , knowing that if I shaped my eyebrows in the wrong way or juggled the grip , she would have had me thrown off the train . Her glances must have become infectious , because most of66the civilians on board began talking about bombs and saboteurs , and about the Yellow Peril that was paralyzing the entire Pacific and might even capture California . Now , it 's true that the Japs had overrun the Solomons and the Philippines , and there had even been rumors that a pack of Japanese " secret weapon " subs was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting next to me did n't seem very concerned about the war . They were having an impassioned argument about who had bigger tits : Betty Grable or Linda Darnell ? And when they finally agreed that Linda Darnell had the biggest " knockers " on the Coast , the one soldier who had backed Betty Grable tried to redeem himself . " Who needs knockers ? " he said . " I 'll bet Betty gives a better lay any day of the week ! " A new argument now erupted . When a civilian tried to intervene , the soldiers cut him short . " Butt out , buddy , this is strictly RA . " Then , for some reason , the soldiers deferredto me . " Let him settle it . " I told them politely that I did n't know . They seemed somewhat offended , and halted the argument . I hid behind my grip . The conductor announced with an air of condescension that no bombs had been found under the caboose or in any of the freight cars , and after severalnoisy huffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a traveler . Even the occasional bouncing of the car irritated me . The soldiers pulled their garrison hats over their eyes and slept peacefully : they seemed immune to all the sights . As my mind jogged drowsily I began to suspect that we were passing and repassing the same towns and marshes and junkyards ; but after recalling Sonia and her father , I assured myself that I would be able to sit out the ride , no matter how many times the same marshes and junkyards reappeared . Then , as if I had just been jostled out of a dream , I heard the conductor drawl , " Blatt'nburg , " and hugging the one good handle of my grip , I scrambled towards the entrance of the car . Bending both knees awkwardly , I disembarked. 67The platform was n't much of an improvement ; it hardly seemed navigable . The planks were warped and crookedly spaced and pitted with sand and hoarfrost . There was , however , one consolation . The sun , which must have been out at least three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it had already baked the planks , and I had no trouble warming my feet . A station house stood behind the platform , but its windows were boarded and its entrance was barred . The shingles on the roof had begun to peel ; even its lone chimney sagged . There were no other houses around . Huge mounds of dirt surrounded the platform on both sides of the track . A tiny , sandbagged fort was stationed between two of the mounds ; the dusty snout of an ack-ack gun leaned over one edge of the fort . The gun was unmanned . I stood tentatively on two of the planks and began to chide myself . " Even Sonia was better than this . " Then , almost magically , a car with a dented roof and two makeshift fenders appeared and bounced across the track ; its one headlight blazed blindingly . The car halted abruptly near the platform . The driver called to me . I hopped over the planks . " Nick , " the driver said , " I rushed like a demon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will happen . " He banged the dashboarddisapprovingly . The glove compartment opened , revealinga leaky flashlight battery and two hard-boiled eggs . " They call this a car ! " Something about the driver seemed slightly incongruous , as if a vital part of him had been shorn off , and he was a little lost now without the missing piece . He was wearing a black frock coat and a rumpled blue cap with the Seabee insignia sewn on raggedly . His head reached the roof of the car , and his hanging jaw loomed behind the windshield . Weblike lines were bunched under his eyes , and both his sleeves were patched . " Uncle Nate ? " I asked uneasily . " God forbid , " he said . " I 'm Rosencrantz , the chauffeur. " 68And then he dipped his cap . " I was worried when I heard the train . It never stops here any more unless somebody flags it down . " He stared at me suspiciously , his jaw now blocking half the window . " Did you pay off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The train just stopped . " " You 're lucky . It 's the first time . " I 'm sure he did n't believe me . I pointed to the sandbagged fort and the station house . " What happened here ? " " The Army took over . They leveled the whole town . They 're going to build a fort or an air strip . With the Army you can never tell . Do n't worry about the cannon . It could n't even fire pebbles . It 's just there for show . They wanted to take over the Home too , but Nathanson knows too many big shots in the legislature . " " Nathanson ? " I said . " Uncle Nate . It was touch and go for a while . The steam shovels were already outside the gate , but Nathanson won in the end . The Republicans control the county , but he warned them that the President owed him special favors . Who figuredthey would listen ? The Republicans are his private bugbear . He calls them The Japs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to come in through my side , " he said . " Only one door works . " His shoulders rose over the dented roof . It was only after we were both seated that I dared ask him about the headlight . " How come you leave it on all the time ? " " Do I have a choice ? " he said slyly . " I ca n't shut it off . The wires tangled somewhere , and now the light shines day and night . Like an ark . " " Wo n't the battery burn out ? " " Let it burn . I 'll say a prayer over the electrodes ! " We rode along a narrow , unpaved road , the front fendersknocking relentlessly and the exhaust pipe leaving a green fog in our wake , a favorite trick of the Green Hornet . But69here , on the unpaved road , the fog seemed out of place . It did n't take me very long to discover that Rosencrantz was an absolutely insane driver . The car zigged and zagged across the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned gates . " It 's the tires , " Rosencrantz claimed . " They retread them now with string . Where can you find a good tire ? Even Uncle Nate ca n't do a thing . And he has connections with the black market . " We both heard a heavy bang and Rosencrantzhalted the car : a fender had fallen off . He stepped out and refitted the fender , the tails of his coat flapping against his knees . This time he drove more cautiously , encountering difficulty only with an occasional branch . " Who wants to disturb the fender ? " Then , as if he were merely switching gears , he began talking about Robespierre and Diderot and the notorious Dr. Destouches . " You 've heard of the Doctor , eh Nick ? Sometimes he goes under another name . But in the dispensaries near Paris he is simply Dr. Destouches . A known collaborationist , and an anti-Semite to the bargain . They say he 's Petain 's personal physician . But who can believe all the stories they tell ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and send it flying through the sewers of Paris , but they probably have more important targets . Just mention his name to Uncle Nate ! He calls Destouches The Go/ern ! You know , a lost case , one without a soul . But he interests me , my Destouches . He was a hero in the other war . With ribbons and the whole regalia . And also , a wounded head to go with it , and a bad case of shell-shock . He hears the knocking in his ears all the time and he ca n't sleep . So they call him names now . Pig ! Fascist ! But there 's another story behind his Fascism . What does he want with war again ? With the Germans in power , he 's a Fascist . Let the Russians take over tomorrow , he 'll be a Communist . And if Willkie wins next time and the Marines jump over Paris and capture the70Eiffel Tower , my Destouches will be a Republican in a week . My sympathies are with him : the man wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He keeps dreaming that he 's sitting on a pile of shit . He knows the condition of the world , Destouches , believe me . " I watched him warily , holding my grip with both hands . I cautioned myself : " If Uncle Nate hires philosophical chauffeurs , what will he expect of me ? " Rosencrantz seemed to sense my dismay . " I know , " he said simply , " I know . " He opened the glove compartment and handed me a hard-boiled egg . " Eat , " he ordered me . " Eggs are good for the bladder . " The egg was coated with oil and rusty battery leakage , but I ate it anyway . Then he told me : " Nick , I 'm only a chauffeur part-time . Officially I 'm the rabbi for the Home . I could tell you whole histories , but I 'll make it short . My congregation threw me out and I ended up here ! " He touched his jaw with one hand . " You are looking at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shaved off my beard . Where could you find a rabbi on Simpson Street with a naked chin ? Now I walk around with a freak 's face . But I ca n't complain . Uncle Nate leaves me alone . I bless the bread for him , teach my Bible class , deliver a cockeyed sermonon occasions , and drive him around . He knows my sermonsare harmless , so what does he have to fear ? Believe me , Nick , the boys here are n't the only lost souls . I mention myself as a classic example . And do n't think the driving puts me off . I enjoy being a chauffeur . And if I refused to drive him , would it do me any good ? He would put me in charge of the laundry or the kennels . Everybody here has two functions at least . Even the boys . They 're all part-time soldiers . Sure , Nathanson has manufactured his own hysteria . He 's told them that an attack is imminent . What attack ? It 's wartime , and Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Nick , do you want another egg ? " 71 " No , " I told him . " No . " " Soon y uni 'll meet the whole crew . You 'll find a rigid hierarchy here . Uncle Nate keeps us all in boxes , but even the hoses arc graded : some are roomier than the rest . After all , Uncle Nate ca n't terrorize the boys all by himself . He needs his henchmen . First on the list is Mama , the social worker , with all her theories and case studies still the number one bitch and a whore in her heart . But you 'll find it out for yourself . Next comes Rubin , Uncle 's head screw , himself a graduate of the Home , which makes him even more of a fink than he would be under ordinary circumstances . Uncle Nate leaves all the dirty work to Rubin . And Rubin has for himself two assistants , Murdock and Billingsgate , the Jailers . Two Gentiles that Uncle Nate recruited from this area . He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I could have found him plenty Jewish candidates . The Jailers are bad birds , this is true , but it has nothing to do with their religion . There 's more on the list , Nick . Rubin 's band of bulldogs who back up the Jailers ' every move , then Dobrilubov , the Cossack cook , who is also the shop teacher . And Pebbleby , the janitor , a walking scarecrow . And on the bottom of the list you will find Rosencrantz , the chauffeur-rabbi , whose box is the narrowestof all . But there is still something on bottom of the bottom : the boys . Uncle Nate keeps them ten in a box . The boys are too numerous to list , but I 'll give you a sample . Matches , who burned his mother alive . An accident , of course . And Bullets Bucharevsky , who is a specialist in tortures . He likes to carve his initials on other people 's chests . Lovely boys , but I prefer them all , even Bullets , to Uncle Nate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am , and you will soon be in the same position . But enough , I 'll leave the briefing to Uncle Nate . I 'm sure he 'll have a few surprises for you . " Rosencrantz halted the car near a wooden fence with72a number of missing ties . " We 'll have to walk from here , Nick . Nathanson does n't like me to keep the car inside his property . I always leave it near the road . " We stepped out of the car , Rosencrantz offering to carry my grip . I thanked him and told him that it was very light and that I could manage it . He saw me staring at the fence . " Nick , " he said , " the fence is nothing . It 's no more than a marker . " He pointed to the kennels that were placed in strategic positions all along the fence . The kennels had white-washed walls and neatly shingled roofs . " There is Uncle Nate 's protection . " A bulldog with an enormous snout lounged inside the kennel nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rubin 's general , the lead dog . I could ram the car into the fence and it would n't make any difference to him . He never growls when I 'm around . He knows I 'm harmless . If you came alone , Nick , he would have you pinned on the ground by now with half your head in his jaws . An intruder would not get very far here , believe me . But as soon as he sees you 're with me , then Shadrach will have nothing to do with you . " We both scrambled under the fence . There were several sheds behind the kennels . Most of them had makeshift roofs , and their chimneys generally sagged . Each shed had only one window . " The barracks , " Rosencrantz said . " The boys live there . Uncle Nate is trying to simulate a military arrangement . So he has his own little army . And the boys do n't mind . They enjoy drilling with wooden rifles . " We walked past the kennels and the sheds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The home of the general staff , " Rosencrantz said mockingly . " They say it used to be one of Harriman 's estates , but I think that 's just a rumor that Uncle Nate himself has propagated . He enjoys creating his own histories . Folklore is his favorite subject . If you listen to him , the Jews invented the world and will have73a hand in destroying it . He is a great believer in all sorts of messianic claptrap . Every time he hears the thunder crackle he convinces himself that his deliverer will come and free him and the Home and all the Jews throughout the world . And the President too . He would n't want to have a world without Roosevelt . " He pointed to one of the gables . " Nick , you see that window , with the boards over it , that 's where Nathanson keeps his little dungeon . If you 're a nuisance , you get a warning , and then maybe one of the Jailers works you over , but with a major offense you get three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you about the Dungeon . Bullets is in there now . Uncle Nate gave him the maximum . " We heard a repeated thud coming from the cellar of the house . I stopped and tried to peek through one of the tiny cellar windows , but the glass was backed with wire , and all I could make out was a few gray forms . Then I heard a prolonged shout . " Ahhhiii . " " God , " I said , stepping back . Rosencrantz gripped my arm . " It 's nothing , " he said . " The boys are drilling in the gym . Murdock is teaching them some Japanese bayonet charges . He used to be a Marine . " A man came out of the house and stood on the porch . He had a short , thin body and an unusually large head . He was wearing a black skullcap . Rosencrantz turned towards him and dipped his cap knowingly . " Shalom , Rubin , Shalom . " His shoulders drew together under his black coat . " Rabbi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Now . " " Nick , " Rosencrantz said , shaking my hand ; his palmfelt moist . " We 'll talk later . Goodbye . " He boarded the porchand opened the screened door . He was at least two headstaller than Rubin . " Later , Nick , " he said again , and duckinghis head , he disappeared behind the screen . Rubin walkedtowards the edge of the porch . He was wearing thick-soledwork shoes . He placed both thumbs in his mouth and whistled . I noticed a stir in one of the kennels . Then the bulldog that74we had seen before bounded past the row of sheds , leaving a ragged curtain of dust behind him , and before I had the chance to turn around , the dog was already on the porch nuzzling Rubin 's knee with his armor-plated head . " Salute Nick , " Rubin commanded him . " Come on , Shad . " Shadrach raised one forepaw grudgingly . " Come on up , " Rubin said , smiling . I was a little alarmed : his smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " Did the Rabbi give you his usual spiel ? " he asked me , but there was no indication of a threat in his voice . " We ought to hire him as a guide . " I shifted the grip to my left hand . " Here , " Rubin said , " let Shad carry your bundle for you . " Before I could protest , Shadrach gripped the handle in his mouth , and with his bountiful jowls wagging , he carried the grip across the porch , leaving a track of saliva . Rubin touched my shoulder and then twirled his skullcap teasingly . " Come on , " he said , opening the door . " I 'll take you in to see Uncle Nate . He 's expecting you . Uncle do n't have an easy time here . I should know . I gave him plenty trouble myself when I was a kid . He had me in the Dungeon once for thirteen days . That 's still the record . Did the Rabbi tell you about the Dungeon ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been quite an ordeal . " " You said it . These little punks ca n't go more than five . They have a picnic here . In the old days Uncle never let up . " I felt a bony tail sweep past my leg . Shadrach had followedus into the house. 75ta CHAPTERThe hall was exceedingly narrow , and whenever I tried to keep abreast of Rubin , nay shoulder would bang against the wall . Even Shadrach had some difficulty ; he held the grip loosely , but it still hindered his pace . A dim , unshaded bulb hung from the ceiling by a twisted cord . I had to duck my head in order to avoid the bulb . Both walls were lined with posters that had probably been salvaged from a recent War Bond drive . In one poster , a grim looking minuteman , surrounded by a halo of stars , was taking pot shots at Hitler and Hirohito , who were dressed as ducks . In another , Hitler , Mussolini , and Tojo , their cheeks glowing obscenely , were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of a door at the end of the hall . Shadrach 's crumpled ears perked slightly as he approached the door . He dropped the grip and seemed to be standing at attention , his buttocks76stiffening instantly . Rubin knocked on the door with one knuckle . " Uncle ? " All three of us heard the gruff reply . " Come in . " " Shad , " Rubin said , " wait here . " Then he turned from the dog to me . " Uncle do n't like him messing up his carpets . " Shadrach retrieved the grip and backed away from the door with a calculated gait , like a faultless , mechanical sentry , only his left ear , which had uncrumpled itself and now flopped freely , showing any real signs of life . Rubin and I entered the inner sanctum . I was hardly disappointed . Uncle Nate was a shorter , fatter version of Moskowitz , with the same wagging jowls and crinkling eyes . He was sitting behind a mahogany desk with short , firm legs . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torpedo , a Bible and a stamp album with equally frayed covers , and a miniature U-boat with a cracked hull , together with a leather bound folio containing the inevitable photographed portraits of Missy Le Hand , of Fala , the President'sScottish terrier , and of FDR himself wearing his Navy cape aboard the U.S.S. Missouri . An orderly row of photographswas also displayed on the wall behind the desk . I recognized many of the faces on the wall : Al Jolson , Sigmund Freud , Eddie Cantor , Benny Leonard , Leon Trotsky , Hank Greenberg , John Garfield , and Bernard Baruch . A forked sconce with two tiny candle-shaped bulbs was dug into the wall on either side of the desk ; most of the room remained in partial shadow . A lumpy carpet covered part of the floor . Rubin ushered me cautiously towards the desk . He stood between the sconces , his ears glowing fiercely . Uncle Nate was wearing a Bundles for Britain badge on his lapel . He rose and greeted us . Then he sat down again . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ride from the station ? " he asked me , his eyes crinkling steadily . I 'm sure he noticed my discomfort. 77 " I hope Rosencrantz was n't discourteous . You must think it odd having a member of the rabbinate serve as a chauffeur . But we are very pressed for manpower in these times . I 'm sure you are already aware of that , as it is one of the reasons you arc here now . Of course , you come highly recommended . My nephew rarely makes a mistake . But , in regard to the Rabbi . I assure you , Nick , I 'm not trying to be disrespectful , or to undermine his station here . " " Do n't worry , Uncle , " Rubin said assuringly . " The Rabbi took advantage of the ride . I watched him from the porch . He did n't waste a minute . The Rabbi 's always peddling his wares . " One of Uncle Nate 's eyes closed : the eye seemed to admonishRubin . " Yes , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And God knows he 's welcome to them . Of course , the Rabbi is concerned mainly with spiritual alignments . Quite a different thing from running an institution of correction . Do you know , Nick , that not one of our graduates has ever returned to the world of crime . Occasionally we hear of an arrest , but nothing serious . Misdemeanors , but no felonies . We have a spotless record here . Oh , there was one exception . Only one . " He arched his thumb and began snapping his fingers . " Rubin , what was his name ? ... that one . " " Meyer Schneck , " Rubin said automatically . " Yes , Schneck . A psychopath . There was nothing we could do . His mind was already decayed . Delusions , " he said , waving his hand . " He killed a bank guard on Southern Boulevard . For no reason . He was n't even trying to rob the bank . No , there was nothing we could have done for Schneck . Our record is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He does n't really know the boys . They respect force . They would pounce on any opening , any sign of weakness on our part . I know . We provide a core of stability for them . They have had enough chaos . I know . Order is what they want. 78You will find no shabbiness here , Nick . No indirection . We provide a way of life for the boys . We civilize them . " Then , his jowls wagging rhythmically , he jutted his chin in Rubin 's direction . " Rubin , " he said softly , " Rubin is our prize . He is one of our graduates , you know . Rubin , how many times were you arrested before the court sent you here ? Do you remember , Rubin ? " " Seven times , Uncle . Seven times . " " Nick , you would never have believed that a fourteen year old boy could have had such a record . Our Rubin was a master with an ice pick or a zip gun . And he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vegetable stands on Jennings Street was safe with Rubin around . And it was n't only vegetables that Rubin went after . The merchants had to pin down their pants . Rubin caused a holocaust wherever he went . The court did n't know what to do with him . He had already broken out of three different reform schools . They were going to hold him in a detention home on Welfare Island until he was ripe for Sing Sing . But then they decided to put him in my personal care . And do n't think there was a miraculous transformation when Rubin arrived . On his first day here he robbed my watch . My keepers wanted to send him back to the court . But I tamed him . " He pointed slyly to the ceiling . " We have our little dungeon upstairs . Rubin was a regular customer . Rubin , tell him what the boys thought of me in your time . Do n't be shy . Tell him . " " Uncle , " Rubin said impishly , " we thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Precisely , " Uncle Nate said . " And the boys here today have a similar reaction . But I get results , Nick , I get results . " He opened the top drawer of his desk . I noticed a pile of Victory letters inside the drawer . He began sifting through the pile . The soiled corners of several War Ration books showed under the letters . " Here , " he said , " I get letters from79our boys every day . Ninety-seven of our graduates are now on active duty . I keep a careful record . Nick , we are represented in practically every branch of the service . Rangers , Seabees , Air Corps . We even have a lieutenant . Rubin , do you remember Shweikopf ? " " No , Uncle . " " He must have been before your time . An extraordinary boy . Under different circumstances he would have been a whiz kid . I 'm sure of it . He was with MacArthur in the Philippinesand he 's now training with the British Commandos . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , " he said , clamping his jaws solemnly , " two of our boys have alreadygiven their lives for the United Nations . One in Luzon and the other was caught in a Nip raid somewhere in the jungles of Sumatra . His body was never found . There was even some talk of cannibalism . Shapiro . Lennie Shapiro . Both boys have been placed on our Honor Roll . I know it 's small thanks for giving up one 's life , but we have to find some little way to signify our appreciation and respect . No , Nick , we do n't cater to shirkers here . The boys learn their responsibilities , and in record time . " Someone began scratching the door . " It 's Shad , " Rubin said , raising one shoulder awkwardly . " He ca n't wait outside doors too long . Do n't worry , Uncle , I 'll teach him a lesson . " Rubin opened the door . Shadrach , both ears drooping guiltily , peeked into the room . " Rubin , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . I 'm expecting a little trouble tonight . Look out for Benny and the Indian . And Matches . " I thought I saw Uncle Nate wink . " Uncle , " Rubin said , " everything is under control . " Then he left the room and closed the door behind him . I heard him kick Shadrach 's flanks . " You got ta go , Shad , if you ca n't behave . " The dog whined miserably. 80 " Rubin , " Uncle Nate called , " cut the racket . " " Okay , Uncle . " I heard them both pad slowly down the hall . Uncle Nate saw me glance at the faces on the wall . " My collection , " he said , turning his neck slightly , so that he might watch me and the wall at the same time . " Nick , I hope you are not offended by my little show of pride . I assure you that I am not offering my walls to celebrities just because they happen to be Jewish . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing our way of life . After all , Eddie Cantor and the Goldwyn Girls were American institutionswhile you were still in grade school . And Garfield . Wait until after the war . He will make Raft and all the rest look like small timers . Nick , " he said secretively , " do you know that Garfield was once here at the Home for two weeks . Honest . He was in transit from one reform school to another . He was n't Garfield then . Just Garfinkel . Julie Garfinkel . He had his own reputation . Not in Hollywood circles , or with the women , but with the bums and the boxcar Bennies from all the jungles this side of Chicago . I wo n't say that his short stay here made a man of him . After all , he did n't even have the time to see my attic upstairs . But I told him to his face : Julie , you have the look of one who will go far in this world . Shape up . Say goodbye to the boxcars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later he was already on Broadway . " Then he slapped his thigh depreciatively , and seemed about to scold himself . " But I 'm not only talking about show businesspeople . Entertainers are all of the same breed : scamps and good-for-nothings . Nick , look at the world today . Our whole century has been shaped by Jewish thinking . Trotsky , Einstein , Freud , " he said , marking off the names on his crooked fingers . " Nick , in two , three hundred years philosophersand historians will undoubtedly say that this was the Jewish century . Undoubtedly . What about the President ? 81How could he get along without his three musketeers ? Morgenthau , Baruch , and Sam Rosenman . " He drew his head halfway over the desk and screwed up one eye shrewdly . " And George Washington ? After all , we have had a tradition of Jewish Secretaries of the Treasury . Now Morgenthau , and then Levine . " " Levine ? " " Alexander Levine . Of course , the history books refer to him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . It 's difficult enough being a Jew now . Can you imagine what it must have been like in the eighteenth century ? He tried to deny the actual origins of his birth , and he threw around himself a cloak of illegitimacy . It was very fashionable in his time . And posing as the bastard son of the Scotsman Hamilton was for him much more acceptable and legitimate than being the son of the merchant Levine . Especially since his mother Rachel , who was a tart in her own right , abandoned the merchantand later lived with the Scotsman . Let the history books tell their stories . The merchant was his father ! Nick , you did n't know anything about this ? " he said , obviously trying to look a little baffled . " No , Sir . " My ankles were already aching , and I leaned one knee against his desk . " Nick , are you trying to set a precedent ? I have one name here . Uncle . " He sneezed once or twice and his nostrils began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allergies . Dust or coal or pollen . It 's all the same for me . And I have to keep away from fresh fruit . The chemicals they spray them with do more damage to me than to the bugs and the flies . Nick , I should have stayed in the Bronx . The country is not for me . " He removed a handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed his nose ; the end of the handkerchief trailed along the desk and brushed the hull of the crippled U-boat . " Nick , 82what were we talking about ? Before my nose went out of commission . " " Uncle , " I said uncomfortably , " we were talking about Levine . " " Yes , " he said , folding the handkerchief . " Levine . He was a political realist . He understood the demands of the world . Washington would have been lost without him . Do you know that our man led the expedition that broke the Whisky Rebellion ? First he appointed himself the Secretary of War . He was at heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to survive has to be backed up by force . I agree . The President would choke on his Four Freedomswithout his bombers and his Navy . And the same situationprevails here . We have our own little army at the Home . Of course , I have had to twist the truth around a little to make it serve my own purpose . I wo n't deny it . The boys are almost completely unaware of what is going on outside the Home . We have a radio here , but I select the boys ' programs beforehand . I allow them their quota of comic books , that 's all . They only know what I tell them . And I 've told them repeatedly that the Nazis have invaded Canada and are alreadybuilding tunnels under Niagara Falls . And so we 're on a constant alert . I could mobilize the boys in a minute . And Nick , a German invasion is not so fantastic . U-boats have already been spotted off the Sound . And who is to say that it would be impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what about an attack from the air ? I 've already requested the War Department to send me an antiaircraft gun . I expect to hear from the President in a few weeks . Yes , Nick , I 'm guilty of enforcing my own little fantasies . But where 's the crime ? The boys are kept on their toes , and if anything should ever happen , we 'll all be ready . " I heard the doorknob click behind me . A short , fat man83with a bald head and huge , hanging ears entered the room . " Uncle , " he said , " I 'm sorry . I thought you were alone . " " No , no , Eugene , it 's all right . Nick , this is our chef , Eugene Dobrilubov . We are extraordinarily lucky to have him . His grandfather prepared caviar for half the kings of Europe . " Dobrilubov saluted me with his earlaps ; they waggled obediently . " Uncle , " he said cryptically , " it 's on . Maybe tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nate stood up and strode across the room . I noticed his enormous behind . His Bundles for Britain badge dropped on the carpet . I stooped and picked up the badge . Uncle Nate huddled with Dobrilubov near the door . " Fine , " I heard Uncle Nate say . " Just make sure Bucharevsky stays in the brig . " Dobrilubov left . " I 'm sorry for the interruption , Nick . But a few of the boys are planning a little party for me . And I want to come prepared . " He sat down again , his jowls touching his chest . I handed him the badge . He could n't manipulate the clasp , and leaning over the desk , I helped him pin on the badge . " I 'm a great admirer of the British , " he said , pointing to the miniature British and American flags that were engraved on the badge , their poles forming a tipped cross . " Churchill is an army in himself . They say he is coming to Washington next month . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tame him . She helped support Churchill 's canteens long before we entered the war . Fala himself is a lifelong member of Bundles for Britain . Nick , the dog has his own badge . And I do whatever I can . Today even the pennies count . The boys pitch in . We help support a crippleage outside London . " " A crippleage ? " I said . " Absolutely . A home for crippled girls . Girls without legs , or arms . Some were maimed by the bombings , and some were crippled before . They would be waifs without the home , begging in the street . They are trained at the home to make84flowers and baskets and wax fruit . Where would they be withoutthe crippleage ? The boys understand . They know what it means to walk the streets without a penny and with no place to go . The girls send us baskets every Christmas filled with mountains of wax fruit . The director calls us a godsend . For him the boys are saints . " His thick lips formed a brittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick , I 'm sorry , but I do n't have too much time to talk . Why should I keep anything from you ? I 'm expecting a little trouble . Nothing serious . I would be disappointed if the boys did n't try to pull a stunt occasionally . But if it gets out of hand the results would be unfortunate . Nick , I 'm embroidering a simple story . Forgive me . It 's a bad habit with me . I 've put one of the boys from A Companyin the attic . He 's been there almost a week . Arnold Bucharevsky is his name . The boys call him Bullets . He comes from Rubin 's old neighborhood . Actually , their cases are quite similar . That 's one of the reasons why I 've taken a special interest in him . If I can curb some of his spleen and get him to cooperate , all my Companies will be under control . Rubin has already cowed the rest of A Company . They would n't lift a finger for Bullets . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . Two or three of the boys are organizing a little insurrection . They are going to make an attempt to free Bullets . It 's futile . They know it . I know it . It 's like a game with them . War maneuvers . They 've been learning Commando tactics , and it 's gone to their heads . They expect to get caught and be punished . It 's part of the game . And I 've assigned D Companyto you , because I do n't want the boys to suspect anything . With a new Company Commander around they think they will be able to confound us , and they will probably strike tonight . " He tried to assure me . " Nick , understand , it 's nothing . The boys know they have a good deal . The Rabbi can tell you a hundred stories . It is n't Shadrach or any of the other bulls that are keeping the boys here . This is the only home they have . It's85a game , Nick . Everything is under control . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black skullcap and a noisemaker with a wooden handle . " Nick , " he said , " I do n't want to make you part of any conspiracy . But it would help for now if the boys thought that you were Jewish . You know , having an Italian name and with Mussolini in the war , the boys might become a little confused . But , of course , you have a perfectright to object . It would make things simpler for us , but it 's up to you , Nick . " " I do n't mind , Uncle . Whatever you say . " I reached for the skullcap even before he offered it . " Good , Nick . I 'm sure we 'll get along fine . " I tried on the skullcap . It sat on my head like a crumpled parachute . " All our Jewish personnel wear skullcaps , Nick . I hope you wo n't mind . It provides a certain identity for the Home . We are not exactly a religious organization , but we are supported for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worry . You wo n't be out of place . All the boys here wear skullcaps . It 's part of their uniform . " He picked up the noisemaker . " Nick , Mrs. Ilirschhorn , our social worker , will explain most of the procedures to you . She is in charge of our academic program . " He cranked the handle suddenly , and the noisemakerbegan to sputter like a slightly disabled machine gun . " Pebbleby , " he called . " Pebbleby . " He cranked the handle again . " It 's impossible to get help in these times . You have to hire loafers or cripples . Pebbleby ! " The door opened partway and a man wearing a watch cap that was beginning to unravel stuck his head tentatively into the room and then pulled it out again . He seemed to have a retractable neck . " Come in , Pebbles , come in . " Pebbleby opened the door a little further and eased his way into the room , his ragged chin entering first . The soiled bib of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pajama top with a faded design under the bib , and a pair of brogans with lopsided heels ; he limped slightly and seemed to favor his left leg . He waited near the door . " Uncle , " I said , already assuming a confidential tone , " my name ? What 's my Jewish name ? " " Oh , yes , " Uncle Nate said . " I almost forgot . Lipshitz . Mr. Lipshitz . " Then he turned his head abruptly . " Pebbles , take Mr. Lipshitz to Mama . " Pebbleby kept the door open for me . " Lipshitz , " I said , trying to find some measure of familiarity . " Lipshitz . " Uncle Nate seemed slightly distracted . He stared blankly at the noisemaker , the sconces on either side of him casting irregular shadowson the desk . We left the room . " Lipshitz. " 87+a CHAPTER D36We climbed a staircase near the porch ; the steps were seamed with metal strips that were beginning to buckle , and I almost tripped twice . The railing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pebbleby cautioned . " Mama 's on the third floor . " He , however , climbed recklessly , his brogans smacking the metal strips . We met the Rabbi on the second floor . He saw me wearingthe skullcap . And after smiling owlishly to himself , he said , " So he 's baptized you already . Uncle Nate does n't waste much time . " " I 'm Lipshitz now , " I said dourly . " Lipshitz . " " Not bad . It 's a close fit . " " The hat ? " " No , the name . From Lapucci to Lipshitz . Leave it to Uncle Nate . Believe me , Uncle has his points . Pebbles , where are you taking him ? " 88 " To Mama . " " Pebbles , I 'm relieving you . I 'll show the gentlemen how to get to Mama . You 're dismissed . Go . " Pebbleby thanked the Rabbi , and immediately began hoppingdown the stairs . The Rabbi ignored the rumbling staircase . " Nick , watch out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They both were made from the same pattern . She 's poison . " " Rabbi , " I said , behind a cracked smile . " The skullcap will protect me . " I do n't really know why I should have wanted to devil him , but I did . He started to laugh , but then he changed his mind and pouted instead . " Nick , it 's no joke . You 'll see for yourself . Mama 's door is near the stairs . You ca n't miss it . I would walk up with you , but I have to prepare a sermon . " " Thanks , Rabbi , " I said , and I walked up to the third floor . I stood on the landing and peered through the stairwell . The Rabbi 's blue cap kept appearing between the balusters . I found a door near the landing ; it was open . I peeked in . Two huge cabinets guarded the rear wall ; their drawers bulged and their lopsided roofs scraped the ceiling . A woman stood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was wearing a black cardigan and a corduroy skirt . Her buttocks swelled under her skirt . " Mama ? " I said . " It 's me . Mr. Lipshitz . " Mama turned around . The top of her cardigan was unbuttoned , and I could see part of her brassiere . Her chest was enormous , and the individual cups of the brassiere squeezed her breasts together and hugged the cardigan like two impenetrableshields . She stepped off the chair and her breasts jumped and almost flipped out of their cups . Mama saw me staring at her bosom , but she did n't seem the least bit embarrassed . I tried to look away once , but it did n't do much good . Finally , sensing my embarrassment , she buttoned the cardigan . " Lipshitz , " I said again. 89Mama began to laugh ; her bosom heaved slightly . " Oh , Nick , you do n't have to pretend with me . I know all of Uncle 's tactics . You do n't have to wear the cap here , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Anyway , the boys will find out in a week or two . They have their own spy network . " She was holding a rag in her hand ; it seemed to be the dislocated sleeve of an old pajama top . She stood between the cabinets and touched their dented sides . " I know I 'm indulging them , " she said . " But I keep all my files here , and I 've become quite intimate with them , really . My twins . They hold the record cards of every boy at the Home , and Nate makes me keep them here in this silly room . We 're having an austerity program , you know . " She pointed to a folded cot with a sagging bottom that was leaning against one of the cabinets . " Nate makes me sleep on that dreadful thing . It 's a demonic contraption , really . I 'm sure its plagued with all sort of devils . You should hear it rock at night . I 'll give you a demonstration some time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a regular bed here with my cabinets . I tried it once . It was like traveling through an obstacle course . I could n't get from one end of the room to the other . It was a gruesome decision to have to make , but the bed had to go . Oh , I 'm sorry , " she said . " I should n't be so impolite . But I so seldom have visitors that I 'm becoming a semibarbarian . " And after searching through the bottom drawers of both cabinets , she found a folding chair . " Please sit down , Nick . " The chair had a very low seat , and my behind almost touched the floor . " Nick , " she said , " I suppose Nate wants me to tell you about our program . " " I think so , " I said . " Well , as you can probably see for yourself our entire program has been curtailed because of the war . We ca n't even fill our quotas . Nate has been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , " she said , " you might say that our boys have been handpicked . You see , we have a rather peculiar status here . The boys have to be sent here by special request . And before the war , Nate was able to attend most of the sessions of the Bronx children 's court . He had to work with lawyers and investigators , but he could get almost any boy he wanted . Of course , Nate was shrewd about the whole thing . He picked out mostly waifs from the East Bronx , and the court was only too glad to palm them off on him . So we have our collection of little Arabs . But with the gasoline rationing and the restrictionson cars today , Nate is stranded here , especially when he has to depend on Rosencrantz to chauffeur him around . And our numbers keep dwindling . We 're down to thirty-seven boys . A skeleton corps . And only God knows how long we 'll be able to survive . The Army has already excavated the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did Nate tell you how the boys are billeted here ? " " You mean , the different Companies ? " " Yes . Nate devised the plan himself . There are four Companies now . We used to have six . Each Company has its own barrack , and unfortunately they 're all down to half strength . There are only six boys in your Company . It 's the smallest . Of course , we 've been terribly understaffed , and D Company has had a rotating Company Commander since June . I 've been with your boys the past three weeks . Actually , before the war , the boys were billeted according to their intelligence quotients . Nate and I would administer the tests immediately after the boys arrived . A Company , of course , was reserved for the brightest boys . Nate would usually pick his trustees from this group . The boys in B and C were n't nearly as bright , but they were still close to average . It was in D that the trouble started , and then in F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys helped91watch over them . Now things have become quite scrambled . You 'll even find a moron or two in A Company . But we 've tried to herd all the misfits into your Company . Their IQs are generally lower than the rest , but some of the boys sabotagetheir own scores out of spite , so you can never really tell . Also , the two youngest boys at the Home are in D. Larry Farbovich and Little Notte . " I heard someone walking over my head . " Big Notte , " she said , ignoring the footsteps , " is in A Company . Nate is making him a trustee soon . He 's the oldest boy here . " The ceiling began to bulge in several places . " Mama , " I said , " who 's upstairs ? " " It 's nothing , " she said , " only the Dungeon . It 's Bullets Bucharevsky 's home now . But do n't worry , he 's in A Company . " " Who brings him his food ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll bet , " I said , " I 'll bet . " I wanted to ask Mama if Rubin brought Shadrach up with him , but I did n't want her to think that I was taking Bullets ' side . " Why was he put up there , Mama ? " " I do n't know , Nick . It was a whole series of offenses . I think he tried to poison Shadrach . Come , I 'll show you your Company folder . " She stood on her chair and removed a large manila envelope from the top drawer of the cabinet on her left side . The envelope was marked " D Company : 1942 . " I could hear Bullets through the ceiling rapping out a tune . It sounded very much like the Army Air Corps Hymn . " Mama , " I said , " is he trying to signal to us ? " Mama moved her chair next to mine . " He keeps himself busy that way , Nick . It 's nothing . " She opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then she took out the record cards . A snapshot was stapled to the upper left-hand corner of each card . " I work with all the boys , Nick . Of course , 92we can only provide the most primitive kind of therapy . But I do the best I can under the prevailing conditions . Nate is thinking of making you my assistant . We 'll talk about that some other time . You 'll notice that I 've made detailed notationson the back of every card . I summarize each individual session with the boys , even our casual conversations , whenever I can . " She handed me the top card . " Eliot Wagshal . The boys here call him Matches . " " Matches , " I said . " Rabbi Rosencrantz told me about him . Did n't he burn his mother alive ? Or was that somebody else ? " She frowned for the first time . " I wish Rosencrantz would stick to his sermons . It was Matches , Nick . But it 's not as simple as that . Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father abandoned them both when the boy was four or five , and left a few articles of clothing : a hat with a felt band , a plaid tie , and some kind of robe . Eliot is very vague about the robe . His mother would tell him that all men are liars and fucks . Those are the words that Eliot remembers . Liars and fucks . I have it written here , Nick . And Eliot began to blame himself for his father 's disappearance : somehow he had driven his father away and made his mother unhappy . He thought that he could rectify his own misdeeds by pretending to be his father . But wearing the robe and the hat only compounded his guilt , so he hid them behind his mother 's washtub . Yet he could n't resist touching the felt band of the hat . I do n't want to go into all the erotic associations that the hat provided for him , but I 'm sure he had his first ejaculation while touching the felt . Though Eliot would certainly deny this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he brought the hat down to the basement and threw it into the furnace : he must have hoped that he would be able to rid himself of his sins , just as he had rid himself of the hat . But , of course , it did n't work . Destroying the hat had simply93jarred him into realizing the enormity of his own crime : his father could n't possibly come back because Eliot himself had killed him . Oh , Nick , it 's a classic case , I know . Boys have had the same realization thousands and thousands of times . But you can not imagine how Eliot must have suffered . And in order for him to bear his crime , he needed to find an accomplice , someone who could take over the major portion of his guilt . He convinced himself that it was his mother who had made him burn the hat . He had done everything to please her and protect her . She would dote on him and call him her own little man , but the more attention she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bribing him for having murdered his father . And the final atonement for him now would be to destroy both his mother and himself . And one night , just before he was twelve , he dressed himself in the robe while his mother slept , and then set fire to his mother 's curtains and the closet where she kept most of her clothes , but the fire began to frighten him , and he ran downstairs . And , " Mama said , " his mother was trapped in the fire . " The snapshot showed a boy with pointy ears and a wide mouth ; he had obviously blinked while the photograph had been taken , but there was nothing else about him that would have distinguishedhim as a pyromaniac , though it 's also true that I had no real conception of what a pyromaniac should have looked like . " Eliot will be thirteen in a few weeks . He still refuses to take any blame for his mother 's death : he only blames himself for not having died with her . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem . I 've simplified things for you and have shown you only the basic patterns . Actually , Eliot has told me very little about himself . I 've had to piece everything together from a few random shreds . But , in any event , Rosencrantz has no right to talk about him in that way . " " I 'm sorry , " I said . " I did n't know . . . . " 94Mama shuffled the cards and showed me the other boys : Boris Potash was the oldest boy in the Company . His record card vouched that he was only sixteen , but Mama thought that he was twenty or maybe even twenty-five . It did n't seem to make much difference , because Boris had the mind of a six year old . Uncle Nate had caught him masturbatingseveral times , and put him in the Dungeon for a day . Boris howled during his entire stay and defecated all over the floor . He was never put in the Dungeon again . Boris had a very hairy body and the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company ignored him , but Little Notte teased him occasionally ; Little Notte was only eleven , but he was one of the leaders of the Company . He was already taller than his brother , Big Notte , who was seventeen and was being groomed for Rubin 's job ; Larry Farbovich was also eleven , but he still wet his bed and cried during electrical storms . His mother had given birth to him in an insane asylum . The Companyallowed him to be the Wolfman 's Jew and knew hundreds of gypsy incantations and card tricks . According to Benny , his forebearshad been chamberlains and physicians to the royal courts at Smyrna and Salonika , and his great-grandfather , Comprado Benveniste , had been a special advisor to the Sultan of Turkey and had interpreted dreams for his entire harem . Benny had lived in hobo jungles since he was eleven , and once in Montana a deputy sheriff had broken his shoulder during a boxcar raid . He was the undisputed Company championin chess , checkers , Monopoly , and knucks . Only Little Notte could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts . Mama suspected that it was Benny who had prepared the birchbark juice that was used in the attempt to poison Shadrach ; the Indian rounded out the Company . Billy Moonshine 's mother was a full-fledged Mohawk who had95been a waitress at the Blattenburg Inn before the town councilevicted her for soliciting and for other immoral acts . The Indian , however , refused to leave . He hid out in the abandonedwater tower during the day and raided the town during the night . In order to keep on good terms with the council , Uncle Nate agreed to take the Indian in . And the Indian , for some mysterious reason , surrendered himself voluntarily to Uncle Nate and became a ward of the Home . Nobody knew anything about the Indian 's father . The Indian did not get along well with the other boys . He was thirteen years old . " Mama , " I said , " what about Bucharevsky 's card ? " " He 's not in your Company , Nick . " " I know , Mama . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't have the time , Nick . " And standing on her chair , she returned the folder to its proper cabinet . Someone knocked . It was the cook , Dobrilubov . " Mama , " he said , ignoring me completely . " The boys will be up from maneuvers any minute . Uncle wants you downstairs . " Then he waggled one ear and left . Mania withdrew a furled American flag from behind one of the cabinets . She asked me to carry the flag . Its pole was only about two feet long and was capped with a silver Star of David . We walked down one flight , Mama gripping my arm and avoiding the metal strips on the stairs , and then we entered a classroom with a cracked ceiling . Uncle Nate stood near the door , warming his hands . " Hello , Elsie . How is our teacher making out ? " " Fine , " Mama said , " fine . " There were only about twenty desks in the room , but they were bunched recklessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low . Uncle Nate probed one of the desks and pulled out a peach pit , a broken pen point , and a clay scrotum that had obviously been modeled with great96care . Rabbi Rosencrantz came into the room . The Rabbi was wearing a white skullcap with a flat roof and a wiggly pompon . The bill of his Seabee cap stuck out of his pocket . He stared at the scrotum and smiled to himself . " An interesting replica . Mama , you can add it to your collection . " " Rosencrantz , " Uncle Nate said . " You 're not behind the wheel now . From a chauffeur you might expect such remarks , but not from a rabbi . " The Rabbi flexed his jaw , undoubtedly for my benefit . " Nate , from this rabbi expect only the unexpected . It 's a question of misplaced identities . After all , where does the chauffeur end and the rabbi begin ? " " Rabbi , spare me your philosophies . Hold them for your sermons . There they will have a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to hop . " The Maccabees , " the Rabbi said . " The Maccabees are here . " First there was a mild boom , and then the unmistakable tramp of marching feet . The sound was unrelenting . I anticipated whole battalions . Then the marching stopped . A man with an enormous paunch entered the room . The Rabbi motioned to me . " Murdoch . The Marine . " Murdoch assembled his paunch and saluted Uncle . " All Comp'nies accounted for , Uncle . A Comp'ny won firsts again in bayoneting and body blocking . D Comp'ny still has n't taken a point . But I 'll work them into shape , Uncle . Do n't you worry about that . " The rounded peak of a skullcap emerged from behind the doorjamb . " Murdoch , " Uncle said . " Bring in the boys . " " Comp'nies , " Murdoch bawled . " March . Hut . Toop . Thrip . For p . " The boys filed into the room . They wore identical uniforms : black skullcaps which came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariably pocked with cigarette burns , mustard stains and decalcoma-97nias , and fatigue pants with baggy pockets and wide cuffs . Their faces were smeared with grease . They marched past me , their skullcaps barely reaching my chin . Another man came in . His head grazed the lintel of the door . He dwarfed all of us , even the Rabbi , and especially the boys . His churlish grin defied the room . Two bulldogs followed him in ; they both wore leather muzzles . The man carried a drillmaster 's stick and kept poking the bulldogs ' square behinds . The other Jailer . Billingsgate . Uncle Nate prowled the room with one crinkling eye . " Bill , where 's the Indian ? The Indian is n't here . " " He went to the john , Uncle . " " You left him alone ? " Billingsgate smiled crookedly , upsetting his pitted cheeks , and slid his stick under one arm . " He would n't pull any tricks on me , Uncle . He knows better . " " Bill , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll escort him myself . " The bulldogs followed the Jailer out of the room , both of them panting under their muzzles . The boys assembled behind the desks , their skullcaps forming irregular rows . The faces were indistinguishable underthe grease , but I recognized Matches instantly ; his pointy ears gave him away . Uncle Nate kept staring at me . I looked down . I had forgotten to unroll the flag . I fumbled with it and Murdoch finally took the flag away from me . He twirled the pole and the flag immediately unfurled . " Boys , " Uncle said , " the maneuvers are over . How can you pledge allegiance with dirty faces ? It would be a sacri-lege . " The boys wiped their faces with the hems of their sweat shirts . A band of captured gnomes . Their skullcaps and their cockamanies and their fierce , old men 's faces drew me to them98immediately . I wanted to stand with them behind one of the desks . The Indian turned up in the middle of the pledge . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his baggy pockets was missing , but his skullcap was still intact . Billingsgate led him into the room , the dogs arriving in their wake . The Jailer gripped both of the Indian 's ears . The Indian grimaced , but he refused to howl . " Uncle , you were right . You can never trust an Indian . He was trying to flood the latrine . " " Indian , " Uncle said , " take your place . " We completed the pledge . Then Mama took over . The boys sang the national anthem for her . Mama 's wagging nippleskept them in tune ; none of the boys missed a single note , not even the Indian . Murdoch twirled the pole in the opposite direction and the flag furled automatically . " Boys , " Uncle said , " seat yourselves , please . " The skullcaps now formed new alignments : most of the boys sat two in a seat . Their shoulders kissed and their arms crowded the desks . Two boys with identically pinched faces sat behind the desk nearest me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with a black lump under each eye , he looked somewhat fiercer and wiser . The taller of the two was undoubtedlyLittle Notte . Behind them , but a little to the left , sat a boy with hairy knuckles who was playing distractedly with a paper doll . Even from where I stood I could see that the doll had Uncle Nate 's features : thick jowls and a sagging paunch . Some spittle dribbled down the boy 's chin . He actuallyhad a few gray hairs . The Wolfman . And the boy who sat in the same seat and wiped the Wolfman 's chin with the doll 's left leg was obviously his keeper : Larry Farbovich , the bed-wetter . There was a pained expression on Larry 's face as he jerked the doll , and I wondered whether he had just peed99in his pants . I searched the other faces , but I was n't able to locate Benny . And so , D Company still seemed incomplete . Uncle Nate clasped his hands behind him . His stubby fingers moved like marionettes while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . Repetitions are n't necessary . Jews are dying all over the world . In Asia . In Africa . In all the countries of Europe . Even in America . The Nazis have henchmen everywhere . Who knows . Maybe even here at the Home . " Uncle Nate looked directly at the Rabbi , then at Mama and the two Jailers , and finally at me . Even the bulldogsdid n't escape his glances . " But we are not unarmed . We are not without will or courage . Let the Nazis come . We will welcome them with sticks and knives and fingers that have become claws for the occasion and we will drive them back to the sea . We will show them what it means to start up with Jewish boys . And remember . Every act of insubordination , every misspent minute , every infraction of the rules is the same thing as sabotage . Boys , boys . Do you want to help out Hitler and his henchmen ? " A stray voice here and there said , " No , Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softened . " Boys , " he said , his jowls wagging compassionately , " please , do n't betray yourselves . If we join ranks and have a truly united front , nothing will be denied us . Boys , our pledge . " The boys stood up , and raising their foreams , each of them formed a V. Larry Farbovich took away the Wolfman 's doll . " Wolfman , the pledge , the pledge . " The Wolfman did n't respond ; the spittle gleamed on his chin . Then a boy with swarthy skin and a slightly misshapen shoulder wiggled two fingers in front of the Wolfman 's face . The Wolfman closed one eye , and with the thumb and forefinger of his left hand he shaped a crooked V. The boy with the swarthy skin had a peeled apple on his desk . Part of the apple had been dug away : I could n't tell whether he was fashioning Mama 's boobs or100another scrotum . I tried to recall Mama 's files . I was sure that the boy with the apple was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chamberlains ; there must have also been an artisan somewhere in his background . D Company was now complete . " Boys , " Uncle said again , " the pledge . " Keeping their Vs intact , the boys pledged to uphold the laws of the Home , to pray for the President and Mr. Churchill , and for the Allied forces , and especially for all Jewish servicemen , and to harden themselves for the coming encounters , and to keep a bold and vigorous heart ; even the Wolfman mouthed the words of the pledge . " Sit , sit , " Uncle said , and the skullcaps aligned themselves in twos again . " Now , boys , we must get on to otherthings . Most of you already know that after careful considerationour board of directors has chosen a teacher for you . He will be taking over the academic program and will also bethe new Commander of D Company . " He beckoned to mewith his hand ; his rumpled palm seemed to censure me . " Boys , Mr. Lipshitz . " I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Screw . " I sought out the other faces in my Company , but there were no auspicious signs . Matches stared at mewith complete contempt . The Wolfman bunched his fingers and tried to frighten the doll ; he was obviously unaware ofmy existence . Larry Farbovich contorted his face . The Indianrefused to look at me , but he still held out one finger stiffly . I guessed his intentions . Benny worked on his apple with thetwisted prongs of a fork . Several of the other boys simplyglared at me . I felt wholly abandoned , but I refused to desertmy Company . I would dazzle the boys . Make them admire me . " Boys , I 'm sure Mr. Lipshitz would like to say a fewwords to you . " I kept my hands in my pockets and grippedmy thighs . " Boys , " I tried to say , " boys .... " The skullcapsqueezed my head and my throat jammed. 101Mama rescued me . She told the boys that I would be preparinga program for them , that they were to report promptly every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued a notebook . The boys ruffled their gnomelike faces . The cook came into the room carrying a gunny sack over one shoulder . A huge carton trailed behind him : the cartonwas piloted by Pebbleby . Larry Farbovich signaled to the Wolfman . " Essen , " he said , " essen . " The Janitor dropped the carton in front of the desks . Then the cook took over . " Boys , " he said , " today we have chopped liver , lettuce and tomato , kosher bologna , cream cheese , strawberry jam , and peanut butter . On white . Rye bread is becoming scarce . Some are toasted , some are plain . Some are garnished with mayonnaise . It 's pot luck today . Whatever Pebbles gives you , eat . No trading . Pebbleby , distribute the chow . " Pebbleby dove into the carton and pulled out a battalion of lumpy sandwiches . The cook himself made regular stops with the gunny sack and dropped off two apples at every desk . The apples confounded the Wolfman . Uncle Nate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a benediction . We arc not barbarians here . " The Rabbi blessed the sandwiches and then said , " Maccabees , make sure you digest . " After the Janitor made his rounds , he gave out the remainingsandwiches to Mama and the rest of us : I ended up with a bologna sandwich . The bread was soggy and the bologna was bitter . I waited patiently for my apple , but there were n't enough to go around . The Rabbi was a little luckier than I : Pebbleby had saved him an apple . Billingsgate removed the dogs ' muzzles and fed them each a sandwich ; the bulldogs ate the sandwiches whole . I heard a muffled bark somewhere over our heads . Then a scream . " Jesus . Shit . Help . No more . Jesus . Shit . " The boys102stopped chewing : their skullcaps jumped . The carved apple shook in Benny 's hand . " Rabbi , " I said . " What happened ? " The Rabbi 's chin rose towards the ceiling . " Rubin is giving Bullets a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our appetites . " Uncle Nate looked at me . Then he sent Dobrilubov out of the room . The barking and screaming stopped in a little while . " Rosencrantz , " Uncle Nate said . " You will have to squeeze in your sermon now . The schedule is being curtailed . " " Nathanson , do you expect the boys to digest chopped liver and my teachings at the same time ? " " Rabbi , it 's up to you . Let it be now , or forget about it. , , The Rabbi adjusted his skullcap . " First , " he said , " first we will have a little review . Notte . Not you , the other one . Notte , what did we study yesterday ? " Little Notte stood up and flexed his earlaps impishly . " The Bible , Rebbe , we studied the Bible . " " Notte , which book ? " " The one about the two Kings . Solomon and Saul . No , Rebbe , it was David . David and Saul . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebbe , " Notte said , " do n't rush me . " His brows jiggledunevenly . " I remember now , Rebbe . Saul was supposed to be the King over Israel and Arabia , but the Lord wanted to pick his own King , and he picked out David . Saul was n't gon na take lip from anybody , so he decided to kill David and stay the King . Now David was hiding out in a cave . I think it was near the border in Arabia . And Saul went looking for him , but he did n't know that David was inside the cave . The story gets a little complicated here , Rebbe . Saul has to take acrap . . . excuse me , Mama . I mean , he had to relieve himself , so like a dope , he picks out David 's cave and goes in . And while Saul is squatting inside , David 's boys tell him : Pal , here is the big chance . Go and kill the King . ' So David sneaks behind him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail from the King 's robe . And when Saul leaves the cave , David comes out and bows down in front of him . King , ' he tells him , my boys advised me to slit your throat while you were on the pot , but how could I do such a thing ? A King is still a King . ' And David shows him the tail for proof . Okay , maybe Saul 's a bastard , but he still knows the difference between right and wrong . David , ' he says , you are the righteous one , not me . I came to you like the Black Jack with evil in my heart , and you paid off my evil with kindness . ' And there 's two morals to the story . The first one is : never take a crap in the dark . " A few of the boys giggled behind their skullcaps ; even Mama laughed . Uncle Nate glowered at the Rabbi . " Uncle , " Little Notte said , " do n't blame the Rebbe . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one what counts . Rebbe says that all the business about Goliath do n't mean a bean . It 's inside the cave that David proves he is the real King . Righteousness always wins out in the end . And even the Black Jack ca n't stand up to it . Right , Rebbe ? " " Right , Notte . But it is n't only a question of righteousness . There is also another side . " I waited for the snickers and the cockeyed looks , but instead , the boys ' gnomelike faces actually softened . I was , I must confess , aboundingly jealous . " What we call morality is sometimes a cover up for something else . Maccabees , there is often an irresistible and unbreakable tie between the pursuer and the pursued , between the keeper and the kept , between the displacer and the displaced , between the hunter and the hare . And this tie , which is nursed with fear and hate , can even develop into a kind of love . Remember . Once the hunt starts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole existence depends on the hunter 's moves . It also works the other way around . Where would the hunter be without his hare ? No , no , one depends on the other . It was the same with David and Saul . And believe me , it happensall over . On the battlefield , in the playground , in the boudoir . I could even show you a few samples here at the Home . " " Rabbi , " Uncle Nate said , " the sermon is over . Boys , you are all dismissed . Murdoch , march them down to their barracks . " Murdoch saluted Uncle Nate and began marking time with his feet . The boys left their apples on the desks and marched over to the door . Billingsgate poked the Wolfman 's back with his stick . " Get in line , boy , get in line . " The boys filed out of the room , their skullcaps bobbing rhythmically . The Indian left last . " Rosencrantz , " Uncle Nate said , " I think we would all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little more chauffeuring . " " Nathanson , that 's your prerogative . But how can you expect me to teach , unless you allow me to explore  --  " " Rabbi , we can get along fine without your banalities . I 'm warning you . You are playing with fire . In my opinion , you are already in the doghouse . One faulty step , and Billingsgatewill put your satchel on the road . Rabbi , it 's a long , long way to the Bronx . And you ca n't afford any more trips . Am I making myself clear , Rabbi ? " The Rabbi removed his skullcap ; the pompon sagged . " Rabbi ? " " Yes , Uncle . It 's all very clear . " Carrying the skullcap gingerly under one arm , the Rabbi walked out of the room . Billingsgate muzzled the bulldogs . I swiped an apple from one of the desks. 105fa CHAPTER DI ' 7The barrack did have a door , but the latch had been ripped off , and the frame itself overlapped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The barrack had been built without a foundation , and even a mild storm would have probably carried it off . I knocked three times and then went inside . The door kept slapping against the wall . Six cots were lined up near the doorway together with six tiny wooden lockers ; none of the lockers had a door . A blistered candle stood in a tin holder on top of each locker ; only four of the candles were lit . A shower stall and a dented piss trough and two wooden , box-shaped commodes faced the row of cots . There was a wooden gate near the other end of the barrack . A bed and a closet were stationed behind the gate ; it was obviously the Company Commander 's headquarters . I was106glad to see that Uncle Nate allowed his Commanders at least one token of aristocracy : I had my own private commode . It stood unobtrusively between the closet and the bed . The boys were sitting on the cots ; their faces seemed slightly haunted in the wavering candlelight . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they might at least have acknowledged my right to be in the barrack . They were , after all , in my charge . Of course , the Wolfman was playing with a battalion of wooden soldiers and had n't even heard me come in , but the other boys refused to compromise themselves . Larry Farbovich helped the Wolfman assemble his troops in battle array . The Indian sat with his knees up reading a comic book : it was a dog-eared Donald Duck . Matches and Benny were playing cards . Was it poker or rummy ? I could n't tell . Benny rolled a cigarette , but instead of paper he used a dried leaf . Only God knows what kind of tobacco he had : it was green and wiggly and produced purple smoke . He kept the tobacco in a coffee tin on his cot . Matches turned in his cards . " No stinkweeds , " he said . " You can smoke all the punk and Shredded Wheat you want , but that 's the limit . " Benny did n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards . The purple smoke drew the Wolfman to Benny 's cot . He held out his hands and tried to catch the smoke . " Inky , dinky , doody . " His chin shook excitedly . His hands resembledmittens . " Larry , " Benny said dryly , " keep him away from my bunk . " Larry led the Wolfman back to his troops . The cracks between the floorboards were choked with weeds and strange , cuplike flowers without stems . I stooped and smelled one of the flowers . " Boys , " I said . My voice seemed to ricochet off the narrowwalls ; it came back sounding hollow and forced . I wanted to hide behind the gate . I removed my library card from my107IIhwallet and pretended to study it carefully . The boys watched me . I felt much bolder . " Boys , I 'd like to go over the Company roster . It will be easier for me to get to know you better that way . Just raise your hand when I call off your name . " Benny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Little Notte ? " I said , watching the ring disintegrate . " Here , " Notte said , " here I am , Commander Shitz . " He stared at the library card . " What kind of roster is that ? Do n't it have my official name ? Bagelbaum . You better mark it down . I 'll spell it for you , Commander . B-A-G-E-L-B-A-U-M . " " Thanks , Notte . I appreciate it . I 'll try to remember . Bagelbaum . " He pursed his lips shrewdly . " But there 's one catch , Mr. Shitz . You see , that ai n't really my official name . The name belongs to Uncle Bernie . He lived with us for a little while . I had seventeen uncles altogether . My mother believed in the shuttle system . She kept changing off from one uncle to another . You want to hear the names of all my uncles ? " Notte left his cot and walked over to one of the commodes ; he circledthe commode and then came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to devil me . " Huh , Mr. Shitz ? " " No , Notte . I 'll manage without them . Larry . Larry Farbovich . " Larry raised his hand . I stared him down and he offered no other resistance . I knew how to handle the other boys . " Indian , " I said fiercely . The Indian kept his comic book over his face . Notte decided to intercede . " Commander , his name is Billy . Only his friends and his enemies can call him Indian . That 's his rule . And you do n't fit into the first category or the second . Not yet . Call him Billy . " " Indian , " I said again . The Indian raised the comic book an inch and spat between his knees . The edge of the comic108book cut his chin crookedly . " Listen , I do n't know how the other Commanders dealt with you , but I 'll keep you in the barrack a week . I mean it . I want some cooperation . " My show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have to challenge me ? Could n't they understand that I was really on their side ? " All right . Billy , Billy , Billy . Are you satisfied ? " The Indian dropped his comic book . He saluted me with both hands . Then he bugged one of his eyes . I preferred him with the comic book over his face . " Wolfman ? " I said . Notte waved one hand . " Hey , hey , watch your language . You want me to make an official protest to Uncle ? Just because he is a little slow in the head , it do n't mean you got ta take advantage and call him names . He 's Boris to you . Right , Wolf man ? " The Wolfman abandoned his troops . He smiled knowinglyand said , " Pish , pish . " " Keeper , " Benny said . Larry led the Wolfman over to the trough , and after stooping and struggling with each button , he finally opened the Wolfman 's fly . The Wolfman peed into the trough ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate . " Carry on your business , boys . We 'll continue with the roster tomorrow . " I decided to inspect the closet . I found one of Mama 's nightgowns inside , and also a brassiere with black lace ; the cups , as I had suspected , were enormous . My grip was under the bed . I heard the Wolfman moan . " Benja , Benja . " He put his hands over his eyes and stumbled towards Benny 's cot . " Benja , Benja . " " Shut him up , " Benny said . " Light the candles , huh ? You know he goes crazy when all the candles are n't lit . " Matches lit the other candles . He seemed to deliberate over the holders , and I thought that he might be saying a prayer . The Wolfman watched the candlewicks burn . He tried to109shape the flames with his fists . Then he cupped one hand and caught the dripping wax . " Keep him away from the candles , " Benny said . Larry brought two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them had been carved with an amputated leg . Larry deployedthe soldiers on the lockers , but they still could n't enticethe Wolfman away from the flames . " Boris , " Benny said sharply , " your bunk , your bunk . " The Wolfman looked at the flames longingly for the last time , and then shambled back to his troops . The tufts of hair behind his ears kept touching the brim of his skullcap . Benny rolled cigarettes for Notte and Matches ; the barrackwas soon clogged with purple smoke . The Indian seemed to scorn Benny 's cigarettes . He removed an enormous stick of punk from his locker and lit one end . The ashes began to clutter near his knees . I emptied my grip over the bed ; Crazy 's campaign hat came tumbling out . The tobacco pouch was inside the peak . I put on the hat and pulled the brim sharply over one eye . Only the Wolfman seemed to notice my hat ; he probably thought it belonged to an alien army . Then I dangled the pouch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke or with the Indian 's punk . Notte smoked near the door . I saw him crumble the cigarettesuddenly and start to drive off the puffs of smoke that had gathered near his head . " The Jailer , the Jailer , " he said . The Indian crushed the lit end of the punk against his palm and then hid the stick behind his locker . Matches dusted the commodes with one sleeve of his sweat shirt . Larry abandoned the Wolfman and smoothed the blankets on his own cot . The Wolfman seemed to sense the general panic and tried to gather his troops . " Boogyba , " he said , " Boogyba . " Benny worked on the Wolfman 's locker , arranging the soap dish and the bandage box and removing the lumps of wax from the candle holder. 110He managed to blow out the Wolfman 's candle before Billingsgatecame in . The Jailer was carrying his drillmaster 's stick . He sniffed the air . " It stinks heah , " he said , expanding one nostril at a time . " Where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Benny 's cot . The Jailer smiled and twirled his stick like a magic wand over the tin . I actually expected something magnificent to happen , but when the tobacco remained in the tin I began to doubt the stick 's powers . " Caught you with the goods this time , huh Benny boy ? " He carried the tin across the barrack and sprinkled the shower stall and piss trough with the green tobacco . He turned over the emptiedtin and fitted it on Notte 's head , and then strode back to Benny 's cot . I saw his stick jump twice . There was a red mark on Benny 's cheek , but he had n't flinched . " That 's gon na cost you ten demerits , Benny boy . You 're already next in line for the Dungeon . Just keep smoking that junk . " Billingsgate saw the Wolfman 's troops deployed on the floor . He kicked them towards the gate . One Confederate soldier hopped over the gate and landed between my feet . His features had been intricatelycarved . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All right , all right , " Billingsgate shouted . " Line up for inspection . " The boys assembled in front of their cots . Somehow , I was sure that the Jailer 's summons was also meant for me . I stiffened immediately . Was he going to inspect my quarters ? I was still wearing Crazy 's hat . Notte 's cot was nearest the door . He stood in front of his locker , the coffee tin riding his head . " Take off the pot , " the Jailer said , and then gripped one of Notte 's ears . " He been making trouble for you , Commander ? He 's the wise guy in your Comp'ny . Him and the Indian . But at least the Indian keeps his mouth shut . Commander ? " " No , " I said . " No . " He released Notte 's ear . Then he111kicked over the cot . " Make that bunk over , boy . I want those blankets smooth . " He blew out Notte 's candle . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Uncle says he wants you to economize ? " He ordered the other boys to blow out their candles . " Matches , you can keep your candle burning . We all know you got special interests in fire , boy . We do n't want to ruin the party for you . " The Jailer seemed very pleased with himself . The Wolfman began to whimper . " Boogyba . " He tried to take Larry 's thumb , but the Keeper shooed the Wolfman away from his cot . " Benja , Benja . " " Make that dummy cut the racket before I crack his ass . " The Jailer watched Benny move towards the Wolfman 's cot . " Take another step , Benny boy , and you gon na earn yourself another ten . " " Boris , " Benny said , " shah . Zai shtil . " " Keep it in English , Benny boy . No kike talk . " Benny flapped one arm expertly and his shadow rose across the wall like a flying cape . The Wolfman marveled at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped his arm slowly ; his crooked shoulder jumped . " Bye-bye , Draka . " The shadow seemed to linger in the Wolfman 's mind . The Jailer inspected the other cots . He gave Larry two demerits : one for not folding his blankets properly , and the other for having wax on the rim of his candle holder . " Shape up , Keeper . " Matches fared a little better : only one demerit . His cot was not in line with his locker . The Indian ended up with seventeen demerits . The Jailer found his stick of punk . He made the Indian chew it . I listened to him count up the Indian 's demerits . " Five for the punk , Indian . If I ever catch that on you again , boy , you gon na be shipped out to the112reservation . Lemme tell you . Indian , you ai n't worth a dime . Then you get three demerits for having a disgraceful bunk . It ai n't no fartsack , Indian . You got ta air it out by and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how you boys can tolerate him . Two demerits , Indian , two for smelling like a skunk . How much is that so far , Nohhte ? I ai n't so good when it comes to figures . " Notte considered the Indian 's demerits . " Seven , Jailer . " His face was expressionless , but his nose gave him away : it glowed mischievously . " Seven . " " Okay , Nohhte . You get another five for having stains on your blankets . I see we ai n't got rid of your bad habits yet , Indian . You know how Uncle hates bunk parties . He do n't go for cooper-a-tive activities . " He smiled waspishly , and then , catching my eye , he winked twice . " You got ta watch out for that , Commander . All them mothering Indians are brought up with peculiar ways . We do n't want him corruptingthe other boys . And I 'm tossing you another five , Indian , for being a pain in the ass , and for trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ta take a hot shit , and then busting up Uncle 's latrine behind mah back . And you get three for making me have to look at your ugly Indian face . How much does that make now , Nohhte ? " " Seventeen , Jailer . " " Okay , Indian . That 's enough for tonight . But maybe I 'm gon na make a special trip back heah tomorrow , and if I do n't see some improvement , I 'm gon na bust you right down to the ground . You believe it , boy . You believe it . " The Jailer seemed to be tiring : he let Benny get by with only three additional demerits . He saved the Wolfman for last . " Do n't you know what the word inspection means , Chuggerhead ? " He poked the Wolfman 's belly with his stick . Then he threw his blankets on the floor . " It 's lucky for you , boy , 113that Uncle got a soft spot in his head for idiots . Otherwise you 'd be down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit for a nickel a day . That 's the rates , boy . Anybodyheah want to volunteer for the farm ? Indian , you want me to put your name on the list ? There you wo n't have Uncle around to look after your rights . You just do n't know how damn lucky you are . Lemme tell you . I 've been on all the farms . Come on , Chuggerhead , lemme see you fold the blanket . " He guffawed obscenely , cracking his tongue against his teeth . He pulled the Wolfman 's skullcap over his ears . I saw Benny reach over and pick up his candle holder . " Bill-Billingsgate , " I said . I had already convinced myself that Crazy 's hat gave me some sort of immunity , but I still was n't sure how the hat would fare against the Jailer 's stick . " Aw , Commander , " the Jailer said . " I was only having some fun with him . If we start coddling him , he 's only gon na get outa hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all . I hear him talking kike with Benny all the time . The Wolfman could match wits with Moses any day of the week . That 's a fact . It would n't surprise me none if he was the leader of the whole shebang . I 've seen all the operators . The bossman always poses like a dummy . That 's the way they throw you off . " I was ready to scowl , but the hat kept sinking , and it finally reached my chin . " Awright , " he said . " The inspection'sover . " The hat must have cowed him . I immediately raised the brim . " Just keep your asses glued to the bunks . I do n't want to see a soul move . I ai n't even sure I 'm gon na allow you to breathe . " Billingsgate saw my pouch on the bed . He walked over to the gate . " That Duke 's ? " I shrugged one shoulder . " I do n't know too much about tobacco . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample . " " I do n't have any paper . " 114 " That 's awright . " I saw him bend over the commodes . He came back with two strips of toilet paper . " Try these , General . " I could n't maneuver the toilet paper . " Here , lemme try , " he said , and he came through the gate . He licked the edges of the paper , and pouring the tobacco expertly , he rolled two cigarettes ; they were both exquisitely shaped . He removed a wooden match from his pocket and struck it against his belt buckle . The match flared instantly and lit our noses and the grooves under his eyes . We sat on the bed and smoked . " Nick , " he said , " we ought a perform together . " The boys were already out of earshot , but he insisted on moving closer to me ; our knees touched . " I do n't usually treat ' em so rough , but I wanted to make you look good . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me off . Hey , the hat 's a lulu . Where 'd you pick it up ? Your grandfather a Rough Rider ? Uncle thinks Benny and the Indian might try something tonight . You do n't got ta worry about Nohhte . He 's all talk . And Matches ai n't much good . They would n't have no use for him on a raid , unless they was intending to burn us out . It do n't even pay to try and figure out these little bastards . Benny and Bullets ca n't stand each other , and here 's Benny putting his ass on the line for him . Nick , I got ta go . Uncle 's giving us all special details tonight . Here , Nick , I 'll make you a hero . " He stood up and started to shout . " Listen , Commander , I do n't got ta take that crap from you . I take my orders from Uncle . You got any complaints about the way I handle my inspections , send them on to him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's little conspiracy , but with him standing in front of me and shouting , there was nothing else I could do . And so , I followed suit . " This is my barrack , Jailer . " The hat began to sink again . " You tell Uncle that from now on D Company is off limits for you . I 'll do my own inspecting . Take a walk , Jailer . " 115 " Beautiful , Nick .... Yeah , Lipshitz , I 'll take a walk . Right up to Uncle 's office . " He strode past the cots and stopped near the door . " Boys , you better take your last look at Commander there , ' cause he ai n't gon na be heah very long . " Then he left . The door kept banging against the wall . The boys ' faces seemed grimmer than ever . I wanted to call the Jailer back . Maybe my protests had n't been convincing enough ? I began to suspect that we had n't fooled the boys at all . The Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart-shaped opening on top of the commode nearest the piss trough , and after probing the wooden wall , he pulled out a hunting knife with a broken handle . The blade glinted in the dim light . " I 'm gon na slice him up , " he said . " Jailer . " He began lunging with the blade in all directions . I stood behind the bed . " First his ears and then his eyes . " He smiled weirdly to himself . " I 'm gon na save his balls for last . " The Wolfman began whimpering again . " Benja , Benja . " " Notte , " Benny said , " light his candle for him . " " Benny , the candle ai n't gon na help . You know what he wants . " " I do n't care what he wants . The candle . " Moving his shoulders reluctantly , Notte lit the Wolfman 's candle . The Wolfman 's humped shadow swept across the ceiling . He ignored the flame . " Benja , Benja . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wolfman 's cot . He scowled at the entire barrack , and then began to sing : Oif'n pripetchik brent a shmipetchik Un in shtub iz hais . Un der Rebbe lerent klaine kinderlach Ver , ver vais . The Wolfman giggled to himself . " Shmipetchik , " he116said . " Boris , shlu f . " The Wolfman pleaded with him . " Benja , Benja . Noch anzol . " Benny sang the same song . The Indian put away his knife . The Wolfman lay down on the cot drawing his knees close to his chin . Benny took off the Wolfman 's skullcap and coveredhim with two blankets . " Shlu f . " The blankets rode the Wolfman 's knees and formed a toppled pyramid . The top of the Wolfman 's head was almost completely bald . I wanted to redeem myself in some small way . I knew that if I could get to Benny , the other boys would give in automatically . " Benny , " I said , " Benny . Look , I 'm not for Uncle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the Company together , I 'll keep Uncle and the Jailer and the bulldogs off your back . And Rubin , too . Benny . " Benny stood near the Wolfman 's cot . " Notte , " he said , " tell the Screw that we do n't need his help . " " Mr. Shitz , Benny says  --  " " I heard him , " I said . " I heard him . All right , under the blankets . Lights out . " " Notte , tell the Screw that he 's disturbing the Wolfman 's sleep . And tell him one light stays on . The Wolfman always has bad dreams in the dark . " Notte scrambled towards the gate . " Do n't bother , Notte . I already got the message . And you can tell him that if the Wolfman has bad dreams , it 's his fault . He 's the one who wo n't cooperate . Good night . " I hung my shirt and pants in the closet , near Mama 's brassiere . My baggy underpants almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hat through the night . I did n't intend to sleep . I would keep an all-night vigil . I was n't going to let Benny or the Indian fall into Uncle 's trap . No , the boys would be safe as long as they remained in the barrack . I would patrol the barrack every half hour . One of my117eyes closed . I tilted the peak of the hat to show the boys that I was n't asleep . I saw my face in the tiny closet mirror . There were deep gouges under both eyes . My cheeks had disappeared . Nick , look how you 've aged in one day . No , it 's just the shadows . One day . Where 's Sonia ? Another time . Anotherplace . I know . I should pack my grip and run out of the barrack before I get sucked in . But how would I get past the bulldogs ? Maybe I could charm them with Crazy 's hat ? It 's just the bed . I 've never slept in a strange bed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be here . Sing me a lullaby . A onepenny , twopenny song . With a cow and a fiddle and a pocketful of rye . And a rabbi with a bald chin . Wolfman . Winnie the Pooh . Papa never sang songs . Only stories . Tell Tigger the tiger to tuck in his toes . Uncle says the Nazis are coming . Under the falls . The Wolfman talked in his sleep . I wondered if he was having a bad dream . I wanted to sing him a twopenny song. 118fa CHAPTER r3I might have slept through Uncle 's reveille had it been an ordinary bugle ; after all , a bugle would have been appropriatewith the barracks and the rest  --  but a ram 's horn ! Its prolonged bleat seemed to pierce my skull and juggle my brains . I opened one eye at a time . The Wolfman was sitting on his cot . The other cots were empty . I cursed myself for having abandoned the vigil and fallen asleep . The boys had n't even bothered leaving decoys . Their blankets were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on one of the commodes ; its peak had been crushed in . I did n't waste any time searching the barrack ; I knew the boys were n't around . The Wolfman formed a pontoon with his wedged fingers and spanned his bald head . " Yarka , " he said . " Mein shaine , klaine kepele . " I retrieved his skullcap . Then he took my hand and led me out of the barrack . The other Companies were assembled on the lawn in121front of the big house . We both waded through the frost . The lawn was flooded with dried leaves . I do n't really know where the leaves came from . There were no trees around . The frost clung stubbornly to the leaves and invaded the Wolfman'sshoes and mine . I stumbled several times . Rubin turned around . He was the one who held the horn . Its tapered end was slightly rumpled . Shadrach sat near Rubin 's knees ; his tail was buried in the leaves . I noticed Dobrilubov and Murdochmingling with the Companies . Mama and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galoshes and a winter coat . The Rabbi sat on the porch . He was wearing his Seabee cap again . He waved once to the Wolfman . " Rebbe , " the Wolfman said , but he steered me away from the porch . We both lined up near C Company . " All right , " Rubin said , " all Comp'nies present and accounted for . A Company , sound off . " The boys in A Company repeated their names in spitfirefashion . **101;6748;TOOLONG . B Company kept the same pace . **32;6851;TOOLONG LunlishMondscheinNossek . C Company lagged slightly . Blumen field Chal finCharyn Melnick SadovnickSpitzerWinder Wohl . Then Rubin arrived at D Company . The Wolfman bore the disgruntled looks of the other boys . He searched the rows of skullcaps . " Benja , Benja . " " It seems to me , Commander , " Rubin said , without smilingonce , " your Company ai n't in full strength . Anybody hear Little Notte sound off ? Or the Indian ? And the other three clowns ? Commander , you know the present whereabouts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , moving closer to the Wolfman . " No . Your horn woke me and .... " Uncle Nate spoke for me . " Rubin , please . You are persecutingthe wrong party . The Commander is not responsible122for Benny 's midnight antics . The antics are our own affair . " " I was n't persecuting nobody , Uncle . I know Nick did n't have nothin ' to do with it . I was trying to show the other Comp'nies that we did n't stage any shyster deals just to keep ' em entertained . The breakout was legit . " " Rubin , I 'm sure the other Companies are aware that we are not in the habit here of conducting sideshows . Please . " " Okay , Uncle . " Rubin blew three times into the mouth of the horn ; the rumpled end capsized after each bleat . I could feel my stomach drop . I saw the skullcaps first . They were pressed against the screened door of the porch . Then the door opened and the boys filed past the Rabbi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Both dogs were unmuzzled and kept snapping at the boys ' heels . The boys hopped across the lawn . Billingsgate ambled behind them ; his drillmaster 's stick was broken . Notte 's sweat shirt was torn ; his knuckles were bruised and he tried to lick them , but the dogs kept throwing him off balance . The Indian was n't wearing any pants . There were gashes on both his knees . One of Benny 's eyes was closed . He groped behind the Indian . For some reason the dogs left him alone , but Billingsgateprodded him with the broken stick . He began walkingin a circle . Matches paused and led Benny in the right direction . His sweat shirt was mottled with red blotches ; the cockamanies mingled with the blotches and formed star-shaped patterns in the mild midmorning sun . Larry Farbovich 's face was unmarked , but his hands kept trembling and he drew them inside the sleeves of his sweat shirt . The dogs drove the boys over to Rubin and then regrouped behind Shadrach . Shadrach licked one paw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys twice . Then he paused in front of Benny . " Did you have a nice party , Benny ? " Benny 's crooked shoulder twitched uncomprehendingly . Matches jumped between them , the dead123leaves crackling under his feet . " Leave him alone . The Jailer did enough to him . " His pinched face bristled fiercely . " Me ? " Billingsgate said . " Hell now , why does everybody got ta go and put all the blame on of Billingsgate ? I did n't do a thing . I just slapped him silly , that 's all . " He tensed the stick . " Back in line , Matches . Back , back . " Mama broke through C Company suddenly , and sweepingpast me , she shielded Benny and Matches . " Nate , " she said , glowering at the Jailer , " put the golem back in his cage . The boys have had enough . " " Uncle , " Billingsgate said , " there ai n't nothing about insults in mah contract . I 'm only doing mah job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear that talk from her . Maybe I use mah stick a little too often , but she has her own ways of scarring their hides . " Uncle Nate intervened . " Bill , please . Do we need squabblesnow in front of the boys ? Mama , let me vouch for him . His behavior was not excessive , I assure you . The occasion unfortunately called for extraordinary measures . Do you think I enjoy seeing bloodied faces ? " I heard the porch door slam . The Rabbi had disappeared . Mama moved away from the boys . Uncle Nate scrutinized them singly , apportioning his glances . " And what did you accomplish , my Katzenjammer kids ? Is Bucharevsky out of the Dungeon ? " I watched Uncle Nate wield his glances , his eyebrows bunching sternly in his support ; the boys looked at the ground guiltily . Larry Farbovich began to cry . His pants were alreadywet . " Mr. Lipshitz , shall I tell you what your boys planned for us ? Oh , it was no slipshod undertaking . My commandos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nothing less . That 's why he needed so many accomplices124this time . Had they found some use for Boris , I 'm sure they would have included him in the plan too . Let me give you a full report . Do n't think that the Indian 's misdemeanors in the latrine yesterday was merely a whim . It was part of the plan . The preliminary stage . To confuse us he let all the faucets run . But his little flood was only a diversion . Benny sent him down to weaken the seams in the main pipe . And when the plan went into operation during the night , our Indian was supposed to puncture the pipe and cause a general commotion on the ground floor . But the tactic never came off . The cook happened to be in one of the stalls when the Indian came in . But Benny knew better than to rely on the Indian for his only support . He sent Notte over to B Company with a sack of twigs , a roll of toilet paper , and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bonfire behind the barracks would keep us all away from the house . But leave it to Notte . His little fire kit was n't complete . He had enough candles to start a hundred fires , but not one match . And by the time he ran back to D Company , Commander Murdoch discovered the sack of twigs , and all the matches in the world would have done Notte no good . " " Benny , " Notte said . " Do n't believe it . The Marine was waiting for  --  " " Notte , now is not the time for excuses . Fate is sometimes a very perverse fellow . One day he is on your side and the next day he 's not . " " Uncle , it had nothin ' to do with fate . It was a trap . All the way . " " Notte , do you want the boys to have a false impression ? It 's a simple story . You bungled the job . Notte . No more . We have to find out what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me after finding the Indian in the latrine , it did n't take me long to figure out what Benny was after. 125And I sent Rubin and Bill up to the fourth floor . You know I leave Pebbleby on guard every night outside the Dungeon . The buys had already disposed of him . His hands and feet were tied , and Farbovich was sitting on his face . We foiled the plan just in time . Benny had his bomb in position against the door of the Dungeon , and Matches was ready to ignite it . They were only waiting for Notte 's bonfire or the Indian 's maneuvers in the latrine . After all , Benny is no amateur . He needed something to muffle the noise of the bomb . Here , " he said , " here is specimen A , " and he removed a paper bag from his pocket . " Do n't let the bag fool you . The bomb is potent . Believe me . I spent half the night trying to analyze its contents . I know it contains some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest chemists would never be able to uncover Benny 's formulas . Boys , it 's probably the first birchbark bomb in the world . Think of it . Think what Benny could accomplish , if only he would give up his diabolic instincts and work for the right side . For Roosevelt and for the Home . The Nazis would never have a chance . " Then he turned abruptly . " Rubin , bring out specimen B. Pebbles , please . " Rubin did n't bother using the horn . " Pebbleby , " he shouted . " Pebbleby . " The Janitor came out of the house . His limp seemed aggravated . Both his cheeks were covered with bandages . " Boys , you want more proof ? Here ! Pebbles , tell them . " The Janitor removed his watch cap and molded it nervously with his hands . " Uncle , " he said , " they beat me . Beat me blue . The devils . This one was worse'n the rest . " He pointed one trembling finger at Matches . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smiled blithely . " Oh , Uncle . He was gon na take out my eyes . " " Uncle , " Matches said , " next time we wo n't let him off so easy . Do n't worry , Bullets ai n't gon na be upstairs for long . " " Matches , I give you my personal guarantee that there will be no next time . " 126Uncle Nate then confronted each of the five conspirators . He dealt with the Indian first . " Indian , I do n't expect any gratitude . I 'm not seeking rewards . But who took you in when nobody wanted you ? Who clothed you and fed you ? And look how you repay me ! Your minor mischiefs do n't bother me . But when you join plots , Indian , this I can no longer tolerate . Remember , Indian , if the Home is destroyed , you will have no place to go . You will become a scavenger again , eatinggarbage from the streets . Remember . " He paused in front of Matches next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this one . Matches , you are a hopeless case . Completely incorrigible . As far as I am concerned , you are no longer at the Home . You have lost your official status here . Commander Lipshitz , please strike his name off your roster . We 'll let him eat with the dogs . " Then he moved on to Larry . " Farbovich , you know you have one function here . And that is to watch over Boris . Who gave you the right to leave him alone in the barrack and take part in Benny 's expedition ? " Larry wagged his head penitently . " Uncle , I 'm sorry . It wo n't happen again , Uncle . Never again . I did n't want to go . They made me . I wanted to stay with the Wolfman . " " Stop whining , Farbovich . Just make sure there is no repeat performance . And you , Notte , you . I expected more from you . Not because you are any better than the rest , but because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time you let yourself get involved in one of Benny 's schemes . Notte , you know your brother was supposed to be made a trustee next week . Was it worth ruining his chances for such a hollow effort ? " " Let him look out for himself , Uncle . " Uncle Nate smiled faintly , breaking the grim line of his protruding lips ; I preferred his frowns . " Notte , Notte , " he said , " if you are such a bandit at eleven , what can we expect from you later on ? We will need an entire police force for127you alone . And Benny . He is the biggest disappointment of all . To waste his talents in such a feeble way . Benny ? " Benny 's shoulder now shook uncontrollably . " Uncle , " he said . " Uncle . Uncle . Uncle . " " Mama , " Uncle Nate said , " the boy is senseless . Take him to his barrack , please . And look after his eye . " Mama walked Benny past Rubin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried , trying to follow them , but Billingsgate blocked the Wolfman 's way . " Bill , let him go through . " The Wolfman shambled across the lawn , his skullcap hopping crazily on his head . He finally caught up with Mama and Benny . I saw the Wolfman grip Benny 's hand and lead him over to the barrack . Benny 's shoulder kept shaking . Uncle Nate turned to the other Companies . " Boys , " he said , " you are the real victims of this uprising . In order to make sure that this never happens again , I will have to suspend all privileges . No radio for the next two weeks . " Several boys in B Company mumbled to themselves . " And Mr. Lipshitz . I 'm restricting your boys to their barrack for an indefinite period . No one is to leave . Rubin , you can dismiss the Companies . Wait , wait . We have n't dealt yet with Bucharevslcy . Boys , let this be a lesson for all of you . I 'm keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brows wove unevenly . " Uncle , " he said , " there ai n't nobody alive who could take the treatment for three more weeks . The record is thirteen days . That 's the limit . He 's already sweating blood , Uncle , and he 's only been in the box a week . " " Rubin , dismiss the boys . Please . " Rubin turned sullenly and dismissed the Companies . I waited until the first two Companies marched towards their barracks . Then I said , " Uncle . . . . " " What ? Louder , Lipshitz , please . " 128 " I 'd like to talk to you . " " Here ? Now ? " " Yes , Uncle . Now . " " Bill , take over D Company for a little while . " " Awright , wise guys , " Billingsgate said , " keep in line . " I watched my diminished Company march haltingly across the lawn . I heard Dobrilubov count cadence for B Company . " One , two . One , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His lips seemed to shed some of their grimness . " Nick , " he said softly . " I know . It was n't a pretty spectacle . All this . But I assure you , Nick , it had to be done . It 's unfortunate that the whole affair coincided with your arrival at the Home . I would have preferredthat you see our milder side . But I could n't suspend my activities simply to accommodate you . Nick , I expect your sympathies to remain with the boys . I would be disappointed in you if this were not so . It 's not my policy to hire golems and bullies . But , Nick , remember , sometimes you have to censure your own feelings for the general good . You think I enjoyed punishing them ? Nick , Benny 's plan was magnificent . The whole little band deserved a commendation . None of my boys here are ninnies . Believe me , I myself was on Benny 's side . But I also have my official position . As the director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retaliate , or there would have been bedlam . " " Uncle , " I said , " I know the boys had to be punished . But not that way . God , what did that bastard do to Benny ! " " Nick , " he said , " sometimes the Jailer gets out of hand , I know . He can be brutal . He was conducting his own littleprivate investigation . He took Benny down to the cellar forthat purpose . Nick , I was never even told . I assure you . It willnot happen again . Nick , that 's why it is so important to methat you are here . I need someone with your sensibilities andintelligence in my organization . After all , Rubin can only be129trusted so far . He 's not very strong in the brain department . And Mama 's right . The Jailer 's a golem at times . Nick , I 'm expecting Rubin to be drafted any day . Then , " he said , " then I want you to take over . And Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad taste . Believe me , there is no trouble whatsoever in the other Companies . Bill does n't have to lift a finger . The boys patrol themselves . Give them their radio twice a week and they 're happy . " " Then why do n't you just break up D Company and let A , B , and C each take two or three of my boys . " " Nick , " he said , " I told myself the minute I saw you : Here , here 's a man with initiative . Do you think Rubin would have been able to come up with such a scheme ? He does n't have the equipment . But Nick , there is one thing wrong . If I shift your boys into the other Companies , then I have three possible sources of insurrection . Now I only have one . No , when there is a cancer around , it 's best to isolate it and keep it in closed quarters . But if we work together , I 'm confident we will be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick , " he said , extending his hand , " do we have our little pact ? " " Yes , " I said , finally giving him my hand . We stood together on the lawn for a moment . Then he turned his back . " Nick , I have an important appointment . We 'll talk again later . " He trudged towards the house , his galoshes leaving a definite track in the leaves . I noticed for the first time that Uncle Nate had a slight limp. 130f-a CHAPTER DIIn the end , the boys did n't seem very bothered by their confinement . Benny put the shower stalls and the commodes to good use . The boys played slug and asses up against the walls of the stall , and the commodes became barriers for monkeyin the middle . The Jailer inspected the barrack almost every day . He still cursed the Indian , but he left Benny and the Wolfman alone . The boys were a little put off by the Jailer 's restraint . They were sure that Uncle was up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed with my boys . Uncle generally kept the Rabbi away from the barracks . He had already suspended the Rabbi 's Bible classes , and the Rabbi 's religious functions at the Home came to a complete standstill . He was no longer called upon to bless Dobrilubov 's sandwiches , and he was even denied the right to131pray for the Jewish servicemen overseas and for the United Nations . For the most part , the Rabbi remained incommunicado . I Hier with the other Companies six days a week in the classroom on the second floor . Of course , it was impossible trying to teach them anything . They did n't know the first thing about long division and short division , about commas and question marks , or about Montcalm and the French and Indian War . They had never heard of Balboa and Vasco da Gama , and when I tried to tell them about the impressment of American seamen and the War of 1812 , most of them stared blankly at the ceiling or sneezed into their skullcaps . During the third day of class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his barrack and pick out the name of one historical figure . I anticipated hearing about Al Capone and John Garfield , but even Batman would have satisfied me . Unfortunately , I took the wrong precautions . There were no shirkers this time : the boys actually seemed eager to volunteer their names . " Zevi Hirsch Masliansky , " said Aaron Zlatkiss of A Company . Barry Mondschein of B Company backed him up with " Mordecai Manuel Noah . " Then came a barrage of names from C Company : " Louis Lipsky , Felix Warburg , Chaim Weizmann , Nathan Birnbaum , Menachem Ussishkin .. . . " The boys obviously enjoyed seeing me befuddled . " Ussishkin , " I said to myself , trying to locate one familiar name . Big Notte finally stood up , and with his skullcap arrayedover one eye , he said confidingly , " Zionists , Mr. Lipshitz . Uncle coached us . " After swearing to myself that I would never again stray far from Vasco da Gama and long division , I dismissed the class . Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of their confinement . She seemed a little disap-132pointed when she saw me sitting on my bed reading one of the Indian 's comic books . I 'm sure she would have preferred not having me around . " Today , " she said , " today we 're all going to have a little fun . " I saw Notte put his fists secretly under his sweat shirt and shape two enormous boobs . He wiggledthem while Mama talked . " We 're going to tell each other about our adventures before we came to the Home . Larry , would you like to start ? " Larry 's buttocks shrank . " No , Mama . I ai n't got nothin ' to tell . No adventures . They just brought me here . I had nothin ' to do with it . Nothin ' . Uncle told me to watch the Wolfman . That 's all I know . " " Larry , " Mama said , purring . " There 's nothing to be afraid of . Notte , come , break the ice . Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can be as creative as you want . You can even use a few of the boys as props . " Notte disengaged his fists . " An adventure , Mama ? " " Anything , Notte . " He tilted his head perspicaciously . " Anything ? Then the Indian got ta help me out . He got ta stand by the toilet boxes and act like a gorilla . " The Indian refused . Mama tried to prod him . " Billy , it will be just like charades . " But the Indian was adamant . " That ai n't my line , Mama . " " Tough , " Notte said . " I ca n't do a thing without a gorilla . " I heard him suck his lip . " I know , Mama . The Wolfman . The Wolfman 's a natural . Benny , line him up . Give him his cues . Tell him , Benny . A gorilla . " Benny glowered at all of us . " Leave Boris out of it . " " Benny , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will give him something to do . Please . " " Ah , Mama . I would n't know how to tell him . I do n't know the kike word for gorilla . Let the Screw play the part . " 133I hid my head behind the comic book . " Wait , wait , " Notte said . " I want the Wolfman . Lemme try . Boris . Gor-ill-a . Apeman . King Kong . " The Wolfman was wonderstruck . " Kee Konk . " His pouchlike cheeks wagged with recognition . " Benja . Kee Konk . " IIc climbed on top of the commodes , hunched his shoulders and growled . Then he shielded his face with one hand and grabbed at the air with the other . " No , no , " Notte said . " He thinks it 's the end of the picture . " Notte ordered the Wolfman off the commodes . " It ai n't the top of the Empire State Building . You 're in a cage . " He walked around the commodes and shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . Shpill like you 're in a cage . " The Wolfman hunched his shoulders again for Notte . " That 's it . Just like that . " Then Notte came back to Mama . " Mama , it was like this . Me and Biggy worked the rodeo and the circus . We practically owned Madison Square Garden . Okay , we hadda cough up fifty cents each time to get in , but Mama , it was worth it . We hit ten purses and wallets a visit , and all the cotton candy we could eat . When it was an off day for the bulls , Biggy wanted to go for fifteen , but I always held him back . Big Notte , ' I hadda tell him , you know my style by now , so do n't push me . Ten , and then we enjoy the show . ' Mama , you shoulda seen my technique . I had the fastest pair of hands in the business . Even the pros could n't compete with the Phantoms . That 's what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all on top of the page . RASH OFPETTY THEFTS AT RINGLING BROTHERS . THE PHANTOMS STRIKEAGAIN . They even began using fancy words . UBIQUITOUS . Mama , it took me an hour just to look it up . And I explained it to Biggy ten times , but he never caught the meaning . Biggy , it means the head bull at the circus thinks we can be ten places at the same time . That 's all . ' But do n't get me wrong , Mama . The purses was only the preliminary . It did n't mean134nothin ' to me unless I enjoyed the show . I only worked the rodeos because of Biggy . I never cared for cowboys and horses . The circus was the place for me . I did n't give two farts about the trained seals and the jugglers and the high wire guys , only the side show downstairs . After Biggy and me hauled in our quota of purses , we 'd load up with cotton candy and go around to the fat lady and the giants and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menagerie and talk to the baby elephants and the one gorilla . Wolfman , that 's your cue . Growl . " The Wolfman growled for him and dangled his hands below his knees . " Mama , the gorilla was the main attraction . They had a big sign over his cage telling how it took Frank Buck seven weeks to capture him . King Kong , Jr. , the Killer of Borneo . Mama , the minute I saw him walking with his ass tilted up and with his own crap piled in the corner , I fell in love with the gorilla . You know , the way they talk about Romeo and Julietta . I 'm telling you , Mama , it was n't a one way deal . The Kong went crazy over me too . Ask Biggy . He was the wit-ness . " Notte now approached the Wolfman coyly , hiding his chin behind his left shoulder . The Wolfman responded immediately . He scrambled around the commodes , whooping wildly , and then molding his brows , he trained on Notte a goofy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the way . The gorilla smiled like that every time I came around . You shoulda seen that gorilla go . He woulda made the acrobats upstairs look silly . You ai n't never seen a gorilla take a crap standing on his head , and without interrupting his smile . Mama , you know me . I do n't like to pass off the blame on anybody , but it was the smile that ruined us . Everybody knows that a guy who 's in love ca n't be trusted . I just could n't take seeing the Kong135 , cooped up like a rooster , with people throwing peanuts in his face and flying balloons in front of the cage . And Mama , it was n't only the gorilla . In my condition , I could n't help pitying the giants and the dwarfs and the fat lady with the billy-goat 's beard . And I decided to free the whole side show . I climbed right on top of the cotton candy stand and shouted , Dwarfs and everybody , come down from the platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free all the animals from the cages . I 'm taking the gorilla to the Bronx . ' The dwarfs did n't pay no attention to me , but the bulls started coming from all directions . I jumped off the stand and Biggy and me headed for the entrance , and we woulda made it too , but Biggy could n't hold in the purses and the dollar bills . They kept flying outa his shirt , and people started grabbing for the bills all over the place . Then I heard one of the bulls shout , The Phantoms , the Phantoms , ' and I knew that was the end . The Juvenile Bureau did n't know what to do with me . They could n't ship me out to Sing Sing . I was only nine . So they sent me up here with Biggy . That 's it , Mama . The whole story . " Notte winked at the Wolfman . He came back to the cot and the boys made a place for him . He sat between Benny and Matches . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama frowned . " I 'm sorry , " I said . Benny 's face hardened noticeably , and Notte put his fingers behind his ears and wiggled them at me . I 'm sure it was n't only the sneeze that had made me an interloper . I put down the comic book and walked towards the door . There were no signs of life on the lawn . The bulldogs were kenneled , and the other Companies were drilling with Murdoch in the cellar . I heard their bayonet charges . I decided to seek out the Rabbi . I met Pebbleby near the porch . He was carrying a cucumberand several radishes inside his watch cap ; his cheeks were still bandaged. 136 " Pebbles , " I said , " do you know where I can find the Rabbi ? " The Janitor kept shifting his neck . " Commander , " he finally said . " The Rabbi 's in his room . " " Fine . How do I get there ? " " It 's on the third floor . The room next to Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radishes . " For the Rabbi . That 's all I could sneak out . Uncle keeps the kitchen guarded . " I thanked Pebbleby in the Rabbi 's behalf , and then I went up to the third floor . The Rabbi 's door was closed . " Rabbi , it 's me . Nick . " I heard a muffled sound through the door . I went in . The Rabbi was sitting on a toilet bowl in the middle of the room . A shriveled flypaper ribbon hung over the Rabbi 's head and left a ragged shadow on his nose . He sneezed once and the end of the ribbon jumped . There were several piles of books near the door . I climbed over them and approached the toilet bowl . " Rabbi ? " He looked up for the first time ; after squinting for a moment , he flexed his jaw . " Rabbi , should I come back some other time ? " He smiled and patted the bowl with both hands . " Lipshitz , " he said , " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't function properly without my own toilet seat . Did you know that Martin Luther first met the Devil while he was on the pot ? Mama says that I have an anal personality . All my problems come from poor toilet training . Who knows . Maybe she 's right . I 'm no rectumologist . Lipshitz .... " " Rabbi , nobody 's around . I 'm Nick , remember ? " " Oh , I 'm sorry . If I sit too long I always end up in a stupor . But it ca n't be helped . " " Rabbi , " I said , " Pebbleby sent up a cucumber and some radishes . " 137 " What would I do without Pebbles ? He keeps me alive . Dobrilubov puts worms in all my sandwiches . " I looked at him suspiciously . " Rabbi , why would Uncle want to keep plaguing you for one sermon ? " " Nick , it had nothing to do with sermons . Nate thinks I inspired Benny 's attack on the Dungeon . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uncle 's right . Of course , there was no direct involvement on my part . That 's understood . But Nate knows that the revolt would have been impossible without me . Nick , I was a part-time rabbi even before Nate appointed me his chauffeur . I had one title then . Commander Rosencrantz . I was in charge of D Company . Your boys . I marched them over to the lawn every morning and then slept until the middle of the afternoon . What could be simpler ? But Nick , it 's not in my nature to keep away from trouble . In the Bronx they called me the Radical Rabbi , and believe me , it was n't because of my religious zeal . My enthusiasm went in the other direction . I 'm an anarchist , what can I do ? It 's a compulsion with me . A fever . I abandoned my congregation and preached in the streets against the Democrats and the Republicans , against the new order and the old one , against the Communists and the Socialists , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against the fire department and the police department , and even against the board of directors of the synagogue . And so , I ended up here . And I promised myself , Rosencrantz , stay away from all obligations . Every involvement is a trap . Become mechanical . A machine without a heart . Keep the world between you and your toilet seat . But Nick , it never works . Could I sit idle here and watch Nathanson manipulate the boys ? Nick , do n't misinterpret . I 'm not questioning his motives . When Uncle hoards sugar and canned goods in the cellar , it 's not for himself . It 's for the boys . Who can blame him ? He wants to keep the Home . But138I can not abide regulations and restraints . Any power over the will is poisonous for me , no matter how many sanctions it may have : God , country , the common good , survival of the species . The beetle needs his dung , and the Rabbi needs dysfunctions and disorders . And so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had the right to revolt any time their individualfreedom was threatened , and as a belated reward Nate has restricted me to my room . Rabbi , keep your bony behind on the toilet seat . ' Do n't worry . Uncle knows . What did I accomplishfor the boys ? I 'm a menace to any organization . My philosophies are only good for breaking wind . The explosions are loud , but the silence comes back just the same . " He clasped his knees and stared abstractedly at the flypaper . " Rabbi , " I said , breaking his reverie , " tell me something . Why do n't the boys accept me ? I try to be a tolerable Commander . I do n't hold a stick over them or even tell them what to do . Oh , I wo n't say they hate me . It 's not as strong as that . But they just do n't seem to have any use for me . I 'm on their side , Rabbi . I mean it . " Pumping his chin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A kitchen knife and a salt shaker with an impossibly dented cap were its only occupants . I brought them both over to the Rabbi . He proceeded to peel the cucumberand scrape the radishes . Then he untwisted the dented cap , stuck two fingers into the shaker , and drew out two tiny mounds of salt which he balanced delicately on his fingertips . I declined the cucumber , but I offered to try a radish . It had a dungy odor . " Nick , " the Rabbi said , munching half the cucumber , " you ca n't expect the boys to love you ? For them you 're only Uncle 's latest lackey . Another screw . Why should they have any faith in your sympathies ? I 've taught them to be suspicious of every one of Uncle 's moves . He has a habit of alternating doses of sugar and gall , of thunder and quiescence , of extreme139wrath and sympathetic understanding . And believe me , Nick , it 's not done in a whimsical way . He balances off Mama and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hard and soft . Like a tinhorn Jehovah . " " But Rabbi , where do I fit into the picture ? " The Rabbi bunched one eyebrow rather bizarrely . " Nick , do you think it was an accident that Nate assigned D Companyto you ? He wanted to give the boys an illusion of safety . He wanted to make them feel that with you around they would be their own masters , that they would be able to get away with anything . And what happened ? The minute they tried something , he brought his wolves down on them and crushed their little revolt . And now Nate can afford to bring back the calm . The Jailer will retire his stick for a little while . But Uncle 's practiced lulls are more oppressive than his storms , because you can feel the agitation and the rancor building up . No , Nick . Save your sympathies . That 's not what the boys need . Break Uncle 's quiet . Agitate . Harden yourself . Be merciless with the boys . They wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be able to throw them off their guard . " " Rabbi , " I said , " I tried firmness with them . It didn'twork . It 's because of Benny . I ca n't find a way to reach him . " " Benny ? " the Rabbi said , sucking the salt from his fingers . " Trotsky would have had a use for him . The boy would have made Stalin eat crow and pumpkin pie . Nick , he was my chiefdisciple in the Company . What , could I make the Indian orMatches understand Bakunin ? They had enough trouble trying to pronounce his name . But Benny . The boy is a borninsurrectionist . When I told the boys that men usually bandtogether for one purpose only : to consolidate the harm thatthey can cause , the Indian picked his nails with his knife , butBenny understood . And do n't think he just swallowed downmy theories . Rabbi , ' he said , what about the Maccabees ? ' 140Now I watched every word . Benny , the only way to fight organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oppressed rout their oppressors ? Then they , in their own turn , begin to oppress . Never mind the intentions . All organizations and institutions end up causing more harm than good . ' He looked at me for a minute . How could I turn away ? His eyes were like magnets . Then he said , Rabbi , when you 're right you 're right . ' Nick , what can I tell you ? He 's an extraordinaryboy . You hear the way he converses with Boris . Did he know any Yiddish when he came here ? The Sephardim have their own brand of gobble talk . Only turkeys and Chinamencan understand them . Rabbi , ' he told me , teach me kike . ' So we sat and studied every night , just so he would be able to talk to Boris . Did the other boys care ? Notte teased Boris left and right . Wolfman . Nick , the boy has his problems , but do n't be fooled by his looks . He 's no dope . Believe me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not impaired . If you only understood a little Yiddish , you would know what I mean . But what can Mama do with him ? Does she expect him to perform on her IQ tests ? So she labels him an idiot and closes his file . And let me tell you something about Mama 's tests . They 're worthless . She went to Hunter College twenty years ago for two terms and she calls herself a social worker . Elsie Hirschhorn of the Crotona Y. And what did she do at the Y ? She was a receptionist and an attendant in the girls ' locker room . And the director sacked her when he found out that all the maintenance men were banging her after hours on the wrestling mat . What do you think Uncle picks out for his Home ? Only damaged goods . " Pebbleby appeared suddenly . " Rabbi , Uncle is coming up . The Rabbi bolted from his toilet seat . " Nick , go . " The flypaper dangled in front of his nose . His jaw rumpled slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even allow me the toilet141bowl . But remember . Be stern with the boys . No mercy . Pebbles , hide him behind the stairs . Go . " Pebbleby led me over to the landing ; his brogans squeaked . We heard Uncle Nate resting on the second floor . He was breathing heavily . Then he began climbing the stairs . His shadow appeared first . The stairway was poorly lit , and Uncle proceeded cautiously , hugging the wall . He mumbled to himself . " Rabbis . What do they want from my life ? Nate , you 're sixty-three . They retire generals at your age . I should will the German Army my prostate gland . They would lose the war in a week . Nobody knows . " He passed us , his shoul- ders tilting crookedly . Pebbleby nudged my arm . We tiptoed down the stairs . I watched my shadow walk . I tried to put the Rabbi 's policies into practice . I bannedmonkey in the middle and denied the boys the use of theshower stall for asses up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word Screw over the door and centered their gamesaround the commodes . And when I denied them the commodestoo , Notte complained that my moves were unconstitutional : no one was allowed to take away his squatter 's rights . Butafter that , he did n't put up much of a fight . Benny must havetold him to ignore me . It was n't worth arguing with the screw . Two days after my interview with the Rabbi , I found awooden replica of myself sitting under my blanket . I had beenfashioned with a campaign hat bearing an unusually elongatedpeak , and a scrotum that almost reached my knees . I also hadonly one eye ; it had been placed directly over my nose . Searchingthe doll for pin marks , I cursed the Rabbi and all his143policies , and then carried the doll gingerly over to Benny 's cot . He was playing blackjack with Matches and Notte . Larry was helping the Wolfman build a fort for his soldiers . The Indian , as usual , was reading a comic book . This time it was Sheena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little tact in approaching Benny . I permitted him to deal the cards , and then showed him the doll . " Benny , I do n't mind the hanging balls , but did you have to make me with one eye ? " " Notte , " Benny said , matter-of-factly , " tell the screw that dolls are n't my department . " " All right , " I said , without bothering to confer with Notte , " then who did it ? " Notte pointed slyly to the Indian 's bunk . The Indian turned the page of his comic book , then he raised one eye . " Indian ? " I said . Notte answered for him . " Do n't blame the Indian , Commander . He never knows how they 're gon na come out . " " But I do n't understand . I saw Benny carving an apple in the classroom . I thought he .... " " Apples is apples , " Notte said judiciously . " You 're on the wrong track , Commander . The Indian does all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think put together the Wolfman'ssojers ? IIe can carve on anything with his knife . " The Indian did n't say a word . He was obviously enjoyingSheena . I looked at the doll again . Aside from the one eye and the stretched scrotum , the Indian had caught my features perfectly . The prunelike expression on the doll 's face was undoubtedly my own . That afternoon , when Pebbleby brought in our supply of sandwiches and apples , and also a special treat for the day , coconut macaroons shaped like Liberty Ships , which Mamaherself had baked , he told me that Rubin had received hisdraft notification . " He 's gon na be leaving for Dix any day . " Uncle Nate had already told me about Rubin , but I was144still a little startled . I had thought that Uncle could afford to hold Rubin 's job in pledge for me , because he knew all along that Rubin would never be drafted . But even if Uncle had miscalculated , he would undoubtedly ask one of the Jailers to take over Rubin 's operations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding conferences with the Jailers , torturing Bucharevsky in the Dungeon , and mastering the ram 's horn . And when a week passed without a word from Uncle , I assured myself that I would not be involved . Then , just when my calm had been restored , I found a note concealedin my bologna sandwich . It was blotched with mustard . Rubin wanted to see me . He was waiting for me in the classroomon the second floor . Pebbleby still had to deliver sandwichesto A Company , but he agreed to mind the boys for a little while . I could see that he was very unhappy about the whole thing . He did n't want to stay alone with the boys . Matches glared at him . " Commander , " Pebbleby said , " please . Whatever you have to do , make it short . I wan na come out of here alive . " I called the Company to attention . " Boys , I 'd like you to give Pebbles your complete cooperation . I mean that . I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Commander , " Matches called over my shoulder , " you do n't got ta worry about the twerp . We do n't bother nobody unless it 's an official raid . He 's safe for now . " Pebbleby was n't taking any chances . I saw him walk behind the gate . Rubin was sitting behind a desk near the back of the room . His skullcap and his angular face startled me at first : I thought he was one of the boys . I looked between the desks , but Shadrach was n't around . A tiny flame licked Rubin 's nose . He had struck a match , but his hand trembled and the flame wavered and eluded his cigarette . I approached the desk and held the match for him . Rubin sucked in his cheeks and the145cigarette lit instantly . The smoke curled over his nose and hid most of his face for a moment . " Nick , " he said , his face taking form again behind the broken shield of smoke , " I do n't go in for intrigues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDR just sent me his greetings . I 'm going in tomorra . Uncle picked you out to take over for me . I ca n't say why , but that 's up to him . " I watched Rubin maneuver the cigarette ; it burned unevenly . " It ai n't permanent , see . Just until I come back . Uncle 's gon na try to get me into the Rangers . That way maybe I 'll be able to send for Shad later . All the Rangers get their own dogs . If they lemme take Shad , I could capture Hitler for ' em . Me and Shad 'd parachute right over the Reich house . So do n't get any fancy ideas . The war ai n't gon na last very long with me in it . " He crushed the cigarette against the cracked wall of the inkwellon his desk . " Uh , uh . Rubin 's coming back . And just because he ai n't gon na be around for a little while , do n't think you 're gon na take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he catches you lining up with the Rabbi and Mama , he 's gon na hang you from the rafters , with your ass kissing the sky . " " Mama and the Rabbi ? " I said . " Come on , we ai n't got no time for dummy shows . The Rabbi 's been decking out with Mama ever since he 's been up here . Why you think they got adjoining suites ? Or maybe they just like to play Monopoly at night ? But Mama ai n't buying up Marvin Gardens with the sounds I hear her making . No . I thought the Rabbi was your boy , Nick . I bet he 's got a lot to say about Uncle , but he do n't believe in talking about himself . I ai n't letting Uncle get shafted , lemme tell you that . Sometimes I got ta handle things in my own way , but I always look out for Uncle . " We both heard Shadrach whine . " Damn that lousy dog . I do n't even know why I bother146worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting through the wall . " Shut up . I 'm gon na break one of your pipes , Shad . That 's another thing , Nick . I want that dog fed . And scrubbed every night . And make sure he gets enough exercise . You 're in charge until the Rangers call for him . And if I find out you ai n't been watching out for his interests , I 'll be back here sooner than you think . " The dog kept whining . " All right . " We left the classroom and walked partway across the hall . " Rubin , " I said , " is taking care of Shadrach going to be my only duty ? What about Bullets ? Am I going to be in charge of the Dungeon too ? " Rubin glanced at me obliquely , his chin at full tilt . " Who said anything about the Dungeon ? You keep away from there . The Dungeon can take care of itself . " We paused in front of a narrow door near the end of the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break you in . Shad ai n't used to visitors . " He entered a tiny room with a sunken ceiling ; it had probably been a closet before Rubin 's occupancy . Shadrach was sitting under Rubin 's cot , his jowls slumping miserably . " Shad , we got a guest today . I brought you your new boss . You better behave , Shad . You 're already on Uncle 's shit list . And I ai n't gon na be around to keep you out of trouble . Okay , Nick , you can come in . " I entered cautiously , anticipating an early exit . I had to keep my neck locked . My head almost reached the ceiling . Shadrach growled halfheartedly . Rubin admonished him . " Shad , you ai n't got no choice . Either you get along with him , or Uncle 's gon na ship you out to the nearest frankfurter factory . " Shadrach complied immediately , saluting me with his bony tail . But his jaws were still in growling position . " He ai n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep him147on a leash or anything . He goes wherever you tell him . But one thing . He do n't like to be alone in the dark . If you got ta pen him up , make sure there 's a candle around . " There was a ditty bag and a shaving kit on Rubin 's cot . He opened the bag and removed a needle holder , a battered thimble , and a spool of thread . I surveyed the lumpy walls . " Is this going to be my new room , Rubin ? " " Na , " he said , selecting a needle . " Uncle 's keeping you in D Company . You can operate from there . " Then he removed his shirt , and smiling sheepishly , he said , " I ai n't got nobody to do my sewing for me . " He raised the needle apologeticallyand showed me the rents in his patched sleeves . " I ai n't letting ' em catch me at Dix with a torn shirt . You do n't make the Rangers that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points . He began patting the cot . " Hey , Shad , where 's my specs ? I ca n't do any sewing without my specs . " I threaded the needle for him . He found his glasses under the ditty bag . Then , sitting on the cot , with the shirt lying in his lap and the glasses hiding half his face , he maneuvered the needle . His elbow dipped awkwardly , and his crooked stitches formed scars in the patched sleeves . He wore the thimble on his little finger . He pricked his thumb several times . " Bastard , " he said , sucking the damaged thumb . Shadrach raised one ear bewilderedly . Rubin abandoned the shirt . " Nick , " he said , " one more thing . The raids . Make sure Uncle 's protected at all times . " " Rubin , maybe Benny 's a whiz with bombs , but I do n't think he would ever try to harm Uncle ? Would he ? " Rubin smiled to himself ; he seemed slightly sinister in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his lap . " You do n't got ta worry about Benny . We got all his moves mapped out . Uncle keeps a spy in every bunk . " " What ? " I said . " Spies . " 148 " Forget it , Nick . Just make sure you check with the Jailer and the cook every day . " He began sewing the sleeve again . His shoulders caught the rhythm of the moving needle and bobbed irregularly . Spies . The Indian in the latrine . Matches behind the barrack . Benny , Notte , and Larry upstairs . The Wolfman . They left him alone . Maybe the kike talk is just an act ? Uncle trained him . No , Benny would have found out . Larry ? He 's too frightened . IIe would never be able to hide anything from the other boys . Notte . Notte is the spy . It could n't be anybody else . No wonder he could n't start the fire . It had nothing to do with matches . Notte . He tore his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Notte . The Phantom . And Big Notte is probably the spy in A Company . Uncle has all the boys boxed in . Benny never had a chance . " Rubin , who 's the spy in my Company ? " " I told you to forget it . " " But how can I help Uncle if you do n't tell me any-thing ? " " Do n't worry about it , Nick . The cook takes care of that end . " " Rubin , is it Notte ? Is Notte the spy ? " " Na , " he said , driving the needle snakelike through the sleeve . " It 's Matches . " " Matches ? " Shadrach dropped his jowls on my shoe . " But he 's the one who stepped on Pebbles . And he defended Benny out on the lawn . Did Uncle tell him to put on a show ? " " Not Matches . Once the raid starts , he plays for keeps . That 's the way he operates . Uncle do n't mind . As long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But how does Uncle get his spies ? " " It ai n't Uncle . It 's Mama . She does all the recruiting . That 's why Uncle allows her all the private sessions she wants when the boys first get here . Mama 's terrific when it comes to149sniffing out a potential spy . She softens ' em up first with all her psychology . " " She puts a little English on her therapy , does n't she , Rubin ? " " Yeah , " he said , " that 's it . " He was too busy sewing to notice my sour looks . " Only Mama 's beginning to balk . She do n't wan na do any more recruiting . But Uncle 's got all the spies he needs . He even got one or two spares . The cook trains ' em after Mama does the sniffing . He 's got a regular school for spies . But he works with ' em one at a time . That way the spies got nothin ' to do with each other . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he ca n't louse up Uncle 's organization . Uncle just works a switch . He takes the fink out of the Company , and puts in one of the spares . You have to get up pretty early in the morning if you wan na put one over on Uncle . " " Rubin , who are the spies in the other Companies ? " " Hey , hey , you already know more than you ought a . If Uncle finds out I been telling you about his organization , he 's gon na pickle my ass and serve it on a silver platter . But he picked you , not me . And I ai n't gon na be around to watch out for him . The Marine got his own ideas . Him and Bill wan na drive out Uncle and the boys , and turn the place into a hunting lodge . But they ai n't gon na have a hunting lodge for long when I get back , and they know it . But the next time Benny pulls a fast one , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm telling you all this . If something happens and Matches ca n't get to the cook , he can still report to you . " Rubinreturned the spool , the needle , and the thimble to the ditty bag . Then he took off his glasses . The glasses had left two deep marks on the sides of his nose . " Nick , " he said , putting on his shirt . " Make sure Uncle never finds out that you been up here . This is a confidential meeting . Strictly between me and you . " The stitches had gathered on both sleeves and150formed humplike ridges . " I want you to take Shad now . I ai n't got the time for ceremonies . " " Rubin , are you sure he 'll go with me ? " " He 'll go . Shad , up . " I had expected the dog to counter Rubin 's command with at least a little token resistance , but instead , he ruffled his snout resignedly , and followed me over to the door . " Remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes . " I paused near the door . Rubin was already arranging the articles in his shaving kit . " Rubin , " I said . His shoulders drew together before he turned around . I knew that he would never become a Ranger . " Rubin , what happened that time when Uncle kept you in the Dungeon for thirteen days ? " " What ? " he said , his cheeks hardening grimly . " Nothin ' happened . I sweated out my time in the box . Uncle could n't break me , and he knew it too . Now take the mutt with you and beat it . " I wanted to wish him luck at Fort Dix , but he had turned his back again . Shadrach waited for my next move . I walked towards the landing without turning around . I could hear Shadrach bringing up his armored butt . I do n't know why I should have been seized with such demonic thoughts just at that particular time , but I had an almost irresistible urge to rampage through the building with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabbi . Shadrach followed me down the steps . I had undoubtedly fallen upon a series of shifting alliances . Billingsgate had helped break the revolt , but he was also aligned with the Marine against Uncle and the Home . The Rabbi preached anarchy and the breakdown of all alignments , yet here he was cursing Mama and shacking up with her at the same time . And Mama recruited Matches for Uncle 's organization , and then turned around and protected the boys151out on the lawn . And Matches . He spied for Uncle , and then fought like a demon for the boys . And where did Commander Lipshitz fit in ? My mind did not permit me to ramble for very long ; it drove me back abruptly and mercilessly to Matches . There was no way now of avoiding him . While I was with Rubin I had even had the thought of exposing Matches to the other boys . I suppose I would have been willing to do almost anything to ingratiate myself to Benny . I tried to tell myself that I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way of condemning Matches and Uncle and Mama and Rubin and the Jailers and the Rabbi without condemning myself . I was bound up with them , and even running back to Cabrini Boulevardwould not have freed me or enabled me to break away . I heard the shouts before I stepped off the porch . Shadrachraced with me over to the barrack . He waited for me near the door . The boys had trapped Pebbleby inside the shower stall . Notte was balancing himself on the rims of the piss trough . Larry and the Wolfman flanked the stall with the Wolfman 's troops . Matches and the Indian were working the faucets . Benny was behind the gate ; he was sitting on my commode and wearing Crazy 's hat . Pebbleby clasped his hands and rocked back and forth in the stall . The entire floor was soaked . The water had uprooted Benny 's stemless flowers , and they swam around the cots . The boys saw Shadrach first . Notte jumped off the piss trough . Matches and the Indian released the faucets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pebbleby said , climbing out of the stall . The boys had stuffed his pockets with candles and salami sandwiches . " Oh , Commander . " Shadrach glared implacably at the boys ; both his ears were already poised . " Devils . Matches told them to throw me down the toilet . " Matches poised his skullcap cherublike and smiled . " I just wanted to hide the evidence , Commander , that 's all . " I 'm sure he expected me to censure him . I stared at him and said152nothing . He must have sensed that my stare had nothing to do with the soaked floor , because his smile shrank abruptly . Benny threw the campaign hat on my bed and came through the gate . Matches deferred to him and stood near the Indian . I did n't allow him to escape my stare ; his lips trembled for a moment , and then his eyes assumed command and gleamed queerly . What was he thinking ? Screw you , Commander . Who 's Benny gon na believe , me or you ? Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke our little drama . I thought for a moment that he was going to talk directly to me . But he twisted his neck suddenly and said , " Notte , tell the Screw that if he wants to leave his deputies here , he has to pay the price . " " Benny , " I said , " I 've had enough for one day . I want everybody by his bunk . " Shadrach backed me up ; he kept prodding Benny 's knees with his snout . The boys marched over to their cots . " Commander , " Pebbleby said , removing the candles and the salami sandwiches from his pockets , " no more trouble . I got ta go . Uncle 's gon na murder me . I ai n't been to A Companyyet . And what am I gon na feed them with ? " He dropped the soggy sandwiches one by one into the commode that was furthest from the shower stall . We all heard the repeated plops . Notte recited to himself . " Hasten , Jason , get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Flip , plop , " the Wolfman said . " flip , plop . " " All right , " I said . " You 've all had your fun . Now I want you to apologize to Pebbles . " Benny sat on his cot and folded his arms . The other boys followed suit ; even the Wolfman , though his arms became entangled , and Larry had to free them for him and then help him fold them again . " I got ta go , " Pebbleby said , and he left the barrack hurriedly. 153Shadrach went behind the gate and sat near my commode . I was still furious . " You 've won this time , but there 's going to be a change around here . Anybody keeps making trouble and he 's going to be shipped out to another Company . I mean that . " I walked over to my bed . The boys glared at me . I was glad that Shadrach was around. 154fa CHAPTER DIILILI suppose I began putting on airs immediately . I took to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was now the head Screw . I met with my two assistants every day . Billingsgatebegan calling me Chief . The Marine kept saluting me . I suspected from the first that they were putting me on , but they never countermanded any of my orders . The cook would n't tell me anything about his school for spies , but he did make me extra sandwiches . I even inherited Rubin 's thermosbottle , and the cook obliged me with hot coffee or tea as often as I wanted . My teaching duties were temporarily suspended , and I would spend most of my time making the rounds of the barracks , and charting new activities for the boys . Shadrach always accompanied me . The Home had a communal radio , and it was my job to bring it around to each Company . The chassis was shaped like a Swiss chalet , and155even had carved eaves and dormer windows . The speaker , of course , was housed under the eaves . The radio was quite heavy , and I had to carry it from Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would often pass half the afternoon with A Company listening to the daytime serials . Shadrach growled every time Captain Midnight came on . Uncle had taken away D Company 's radio privileges , but Norte kept asking me about the programs . " How did the Fat Man make out last week , Commander ? Did the Hornet ditch Kato yet ? " I had actually expected the boys to despise my new position , but in some perverse way they seemed to take pride in knowing that their own Commander was Uncle 's head Screw . They even became more tolerant of Shadrach . The Indian offered to feed him , but I declined his offer . I was n't taking any chances . The boys had already tried to poison Shadrach once . Benny still kept up his ritual : " Notte , tell the Screw .... " But even he softened his stand a little and would often send over Notte with questions . " Head Commander Shitz , Benny wants to know when Uncle 's gon na allow us to use the radio again ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hat summarily and assuming a gruff tone , " tell him that I 'll work on Uncle for him . " My relations with Matches also gradually improved . Once he saw that I did n't intend giving him away , he began saluting Shadrach and me , and lie now cleaned my commode along with the others . And Mama no longer seemed to mind having me around during the therapy sessions . But I resisted all her overtures . When Matches faltered , whom would she wheedle next ? As soon as Mania came in , I often left the barrack . If I had a little free time , I went up to the Rabbi . He still kept railing against Mama and Uncle , but I no longer paid much attention to him . I suppose I really wanted to diddlehim , and I had to hold myself back from asking him if he played Monopoly with Mama at night . The Rabbi , of course , was immediately suspicious of my new position . " Do n't worry , " he said , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calm . But when the explosions come , he 'll tumble you over in a minute . And he 'll put the cook or the man with the stick in charge . Nick , I do n't like the signs . At least Rubin , in his own way , kept the peace . " " Kept the peace ? What about Bucharevsky in the Dun-geon ? " " Bullets , " the Rabbi said , stroking his bald chin . He was ready to fly off his toilet seat . " Nick , now is the time for a little liberation . Test some of your power . See if you can persuade Uncle to free Bullets . " I backed off immediately . " Rabbi , I 'll formulate my own policies , thank you . " " Nick , it 's your obligation . The Dungeon was always Rubin 's territory . " " Rabbi , do n't talk to me about obligations . Bullets is all right where he is . If Uncle sends around the jailer to pinchhitfor Rubin , then I 'll act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One . Pay a visit to the Dungeon . Go up and see Bucharevsky for yourself . " " No , " I said . " No . " I must have been out to spite the Rabbi in my own wacky way , because that afternoon I did go upstairs to the Dungeon . Pebbleby was on guard outside the door . He sat on a bench , his chin embedded in his watch cap . His neck stiffened as soon as he saw me . It did n't take him very long to glean my purpose . " Commander , " he said , " you do n't want to go in there , no . I 'd rather have your boys for a lifetime than spend a minute with him . You do n't know the artillery Rubin brought with him every time he came up . You ai n't even got the hound with you ? " " Shadrach ? I left him on the porch . " There was a slot with a wide lip near the bottom of the door . A jar and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urine which had already turned brown . The plate was cluttered with moldy asparagus shoots . " Pebbles , I 'm going in . " Ile looked at me once . Seeing that it was hopeless , he shrugged one shoulder and handed me a flashlight with a bulging neck . Then he became a little indignant . " Do n't expect me to come in and bail you out . You 're on your own , Commander . " The door was bolted in three places , and I watched his shoulders swerve as he undid the bolts . I went inside . He locked the door quickly behind me and began clicking the bolts . The flashlight shook in my hand , its beam zigzagging across the wall . The Dungeon was even smaller than Rubin 's room . There was a narrow pen with screened sides in the middle of the floor . I steadied my hand and trained the beam on the pen . There was no one inside . " Commissioner , " someone said , " ditch the light . You want me to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was smoking a cigar . " Here , " he said , lighting a candle and placing it on top of the pen . I turned off the flashlight . His face seemed ogrelike behind the candle . The wavering light notched his cheeks and his chin . He was n't wearing a skullcap . " Bullets , " I said , " how come you 're not inside the pen ? " " That , " he said , strumming the wire walls , " that 's just for the tourists . Hey , Ki7no Sabbee , did the Rube leave any cigars for me before he left ? " " What ? " I said . " My supply is dwindling . The Rube promised me anotherbox . It ai n't no picnic lying around here all day . Where 's Shad ? I got a few bones for him . " " What the hell is going on here , " I said . " Is this a dungeon or a country club ? " " Do n't blow your stack , Commissioner . You wanna158bring Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreheadwrinkle up , because he said , " Uncle , Uncle . You 'll spoil the whole setup for me . " He began staring at my campaign hat . I sat on the edge of the pen . The wire pinched my behind . " What about all the screaming and the barking ? Was n't Rubin supposed to work you over ? I thought .... " Bullets gave me a demonstration . He banged the walls of the pen and began screaming for me ; the candle rocked . " No more , Commissioner , please . No more . I 'll do anything you say . No more . Please . Ahhhhh . Ooolzhhh . " Then he smiled mischievously . " It 's all an act . Rubin taught me the works . He told me to put on a good show for Uncle and the boys . " " You mean Uncle does n't know what 's going on up here ? " " You kidding ? He thinks Rubin was giving me the treatmentall the time . But me and the Rube are landsmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin Shloime used to go bopping together . " He pressed my knee confidingly . " They drowned a boogy once in Indian Lake . The aces dragged the bottom for a week before they found him . He came up with a blue head . Imagine . A boogy with a blue head . I think his name was Calvin . And the boogies took their toll on us too . Shloime only has one good eye . And they caught my sister Frimke in Crotona Park one night and she almost ended up with a nigger baby . No , the kikes from CharlotteStreet hadda stick together or the boogies and the micks woulda drove us into the Bronx River . So do n't expect Rubin to take it out on me . All the screaming and the hullabaloo was just to keep Uncle happy . He thinks I 'm sweating it out in the box . " " What about Benny ? Did n't you know that he tried to storm the Dungeon ? " " Benny ? Oh , the spick from D Company . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
