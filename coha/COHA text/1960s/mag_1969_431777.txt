 | After a battle , the Prince Still buzzing about a Kentucky Derby that was one of the best contests in years , racing buffs happily may contemplate an even better Preakness . Three of the first five Derby finishers are back ? Majestic Prince , Arts and Letters and Top Knight ? and a few newcomers should enhance the action of Round 2 in the Triple Crown series . Two of the Derby 's top five will pass up the mile and %g race at Pimlico ( a sixteenth shorter than Louisville 's ) . Dike ran down slightly at Churchill Downs and will be saved for the Belmont ; Traffic Mark will henceforth associate with less formidable rivals . In their places , filling out a field that may go as high as 10 , are Al Hattab , beaten only a nose by Dike in the Wood Memorial , Dike 's stablemate Jay Ray , the come-from-behind winner of the California Derby , Calumet Farm 's Best Turn , Elmendorf Farm 's Captain Action , Mike Phipps ' Greengrass Greene and , possibly , Tyrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third place in last week 's foulmarred Withers at Aqueduct . The Withers results , unfortunately , offer little guidance to the Preakness . The first across the finish line , Neil Hellman 's 18-to-l-shot , Gleaming Light , was disqualified and placed fifth for obvious interference in the stretch . Since he missed out on any part of the purse and is n't a Preakness nominee to begin with , it seems highly unlikely that Hellman will cough up $10,000 this week to make Gleaming Light a supplementary nomination . Captain Harry Guggenheim 's Ack Ack thus became the Withers winner by default and , for the first time in his long career , Jockey Manuel Ycaza won a stakes race through a disqualification . But Guggenheim announced after the race that Ack Ack had tired and would skip the Preakness . Such also-rans as Blade and Palauli probably will , too , and indeed , those who are electing to challenge the Derby big three do not have the most cheering prospects . But optimism is a part of every horseman 's makeup . Jimmy Conway , trainer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like going bear hunting with a switch , but I guess we got to give it a try . " Majestic Prince , Arts and Letters Top Knight seem to be coming up Preakness Day exactly " right , " U 1-means any of them could win . Yes . e Top Knight , who did not run the r3 of which he is capable at Church Downs . It might have been his five- ? ? layoff after the Florida Derby , or so thing more serious like leg trouble . St it is worth recalling that after Top Kn i ran " short " in last winter 's Everglade he came back brilliantly to win the F mingo and Florida Derby . Arts and Letters , now a four-time er ( each time , second ) in his last ti races , may not have it in him to be a class sic winner , but one can never eliminate a genuine fighter from consideration . fought Majestic Prince all the way down the long stretch in the Derby and th lost by only a neck . Braulio Baeza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and the opposition than he did in Louisville . But that small ei may not be enough . As for Majestic Prince , who is n eight-for-eight , how can he be faulted Or Johnny Longden or Bill Hartack ! ' The big , durable chestnut has run six times since early January and won ail but the Derby by four lengths or More Longden indicated his fitness by asking nothing strenuous of him in his first postDerby week . Johnny also raised a few eyebrows at Pimlico when he announced he was sending for California blacksmith Bill Bane to shoe Majestic Princethiss week . Bane is a specialist in repairing quarter cracks , with his invention kno ? as the Bane Patch . Those who still do not believe Ma- 1 jestic Prince is the best colt point c . : that the Pimlico strip is sandier than Churchill Downs , and not as fast , and therefore very different from California surfaces . Never mind that . He has won on strips labeled fast , sloppy , muddy . and good . It probably will not snow hail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bother him , either .
