As a special assistant to President John F. Kennedy , Harvard Professor Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr . did some troubleshooting in Latin American affairs , traveled south with a Food-for-Peace mission , served as idea man and occasional speechwriter . And since he was also a Pulitzer-prizewinning historian , his memoirs of the Kennedy years were much in demand . Now , in a LIFE series based on a forthcoming book , Schlesinger offers some intriguing new details regarding two of John F. Kennedy 's biggest-and most controversial - decisions . <P> <P> " He Grabbed . " The first was the selection of Lyndon Johnson as Kennedy 's vice-presidential running mate in the 1960 election . Schlesinger reports that Kennedy had previously viewed Johnson " with mingled admiration and despair , " referred to the Texan as the " riverboat gambler . " But , declares Schlesinger , on the night he was nominated Kennedy decided to make the " first offer " of the vice-presidency to Johnson as a gesture aimed at reuniting the Democrats . Because of the bitterness of the Kennedy-Johnson fight for the nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schlesinger , Kennedy " was certain that there was practically no chance that Johnson would accept . " <P> To Kennedy 's amazement , " Johnson showed every interest in the project . " Schlesinger quotes Kennedy as telling a friend : " ' I did n't offer the vice-presidency to him . I just held it out like this ' - here he simulated taking an object out of his pocket and holding it close to his body-'and he grabbed at it . ' " Jack dispatched Brother Bobby to the Johnson hotel suite . Bobby , writes Schlesinger , " said that he was there to report that an ugly floor fight was in prospect . If Senator Johnson did not want to subject himself to this kind of unpleasantness , Senator Kennedy would fully understand . Should Johnson prefer to withdraw , the candidate would wish to make him chairman of the Democratic National Committee . " <P> Relates Schlesinger : " Johnson said with great and mournful emotion , ' I want to be Vice President . . . ' Robert Kennedy said cryptically , ' He wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vice President . ' " Later , Bobby leaned " against the wall and said . . . ' My God , this would n't have happened except that we were all too tired last night . ' " <P> Asked at his press conference last week about Schlesinger 's version , President Johnson maintained that he had truly been wanted . Kennedy , said L.B.J. , " asked me on his own motion to go on the ticket with him , and I gave him my reasons for hesitating . " Johnson 's old friend and congressional patron , the late House Speaker " Mr. Sam " Rayburn , was initially dead set against L.B.J. 's joining the Kennedy ticket ; so was virtually everyone else in Johnson 's camp . But Kennedy , President Johnson declared at his news conference , " told me he would speak to Speaker Rayburn and others and he did . And subsequently he called me and said , ' Here is a statement I 'm going to read on television naming you , unless you have an objection . ' I listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should do what 1 did . " <P>
