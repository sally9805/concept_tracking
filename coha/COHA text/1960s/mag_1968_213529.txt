NOTHING is tougher than being a policeman in a free society . For one thing , the U.S. Constitution guarantees as much individual liberty as public safety will allow . To uphold that elusive ideal , the policeman is supposed to mediate family disputes that would tax a Supreme Court Justice , soothe angry ghetto Negroes despite his scant knowledge of psychology , enforce hundreds of petty laws without discrimination , and use only necessary force to bring violators before the courts . The job demands extraordinary skill , restraint and character-qualities not usually understood by either cop-hating leftists , who sound as if they want to exterminate all policemen , or by dissent-hating conservatives , who seem to want policemen to run the U.S. in a paroxysm of punitive " law and order . " <P> <P> The U.S. policeman is forbidden to act as judge and jury-for that way lies the police state . Yet he also has enormous discretion to keep the peace by enforcing some laws and overlooking others . How does he exercise that discretion ? Largely on the basis of common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , he now faces an era of drastically changing mores that challenges his most cherished creeds and conceptions . <P> Most Americans are not even sure what they want the police to police . " We ask our officers to be a combination of Bat Masterson , Sherlock Holmes , Sigmund Freud , King Solomon , Hercules and Diogenes , " says Rocky Pomerance , Miami Beach police chief . Indeed , the U.S. often seems lucky to have any cops at all . Plato envisaged the policeman 's lofty forebear as the " guardian " of law and order and placed him near the very top of his ideal society , endowing him with special wisdom , strength and patience . The U.S. has put its guardians near the bottom . In most places , the pay for an experienced policeman is less than $7,000 a year , forcing many cops to moonlight and some to take bribes . Fear and loneliness are routine hazards . Last year 76 American policemen were killed and 10,770 injured by assault . " Everything you do is more or less on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan 's West Side . " Trouble starts , and there you are . " The average cop feels that he is unappreciated or even actively disliked by the public he serves . Very often he is right-and thus all the more prone to confine his entire social as well as professional life to his fellow cops , a group that all too often sees the world as " we " and " they . " <P> <P> Search for Power <P> Who wants to be a cop ? One of the most common types is the ex-high school athlete who went directly into a virile military unit like the Marines , and now seeks security in a job that requires no college degree . Often he aims to live far from the inner city-a lower-middle-class aspiration that produces white commuter cops who nervously regard black-ghetto patrols as raids behind enemy lines . According to Chicago Psychiatrist Clifton Rhead , a policeman needs distinct traits-a tendency to be suspicious , act fast , take risks , be aggressive and obey authority .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
