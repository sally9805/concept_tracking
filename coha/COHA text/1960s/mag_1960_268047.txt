A World War II fighter pilot ( his bag : 15 Japanese aircraft , including one bearing Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto ) , Lanphier joined Convair in 1954 , became key man in long-range planning for Convair 's Atlas missile program . But his blunt criticism of the Administration 's defense effort and sharp attacks on rival missilemakers provoked General Dynamics Chairman Frank Pace to ease him out . On his own , Lanphier stumped the country , pleading for increased spending for missiles , decided to work outside the defense field , took a job as vice president for planning at Fairbanks Whitney , which does only 5% of its business with the Government and which has been in the process of reorganization ever since the Morse family was forced out in a proxy fight two years ago. * <P> Henry Ford II , 43 , chairman and chief executive officer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacated by Robert S.
