In the 55 years that he has represented Arizona on Capitol Hill , Carl Hayden , 90 , has been nothing if not patient . For the past two decades , Hayden has been polishing legislation to authorize a Central Arizona Project , a vast network of dams and waterways to irrigate his arid state . In deference to his seniority and his power as chairman of the Appropriations Committee , the Senate has passed his Arizona bills three times-most recently last August when , despite their economizing mood , his colleagues approved a $1.2 billion appropriation for the project , along with five other Colorado River plans . <P> But Hayden 's dream program has always died in committee on the other side of the Hill . Colorado 's Wayne Aspinall , chairman of the House Interior Committee , and a crusty young whippersnapper of 71 , has effectively blocked the bill because his state-along with six others-shares the source of Arizona 's water : the Colorado River . Unless Colorado 's share of the water was guaranteed Aspinall was not about to let any of Hayden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's latest bill was passed in the Senate , Aspinall simply ignored it , just as he had promised he would . When his committee finished its other business at the end of August , he went home to Colorado . <P> " It Amounts to Blackmail . " But this time Carl Hayden was apparently a mite impatient . Once Aspinall was out of town , Hayden blandly asked his colleagues on the Appropriations Committee if they saw anything wrong with attaching the Central Arizona Project as a rider to the $4.7 billion public-works bill-the " pork barrel " package on its way to the Senate floor . Of course not , said the committee . <P> Then Hayden sat placidly back and waited . Aspinall got word of what had happened and hotfooted it back to Washington . How could the House accept the Central Arizona Project as part of the public-works bill ? he asked . The House was supposed to be trying to cut expenditures . But then , how could Congressmen vote down a bill containing all those pork-barrel projects so dear to their hearts ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congress could be caught up in a ruckus that might last until Christmas . Most people would probably blame Aspinall . <P> Caught in a trap , Aspinall backed down . " It amounts to blackmail , " he grumbled , as he allowed that if Hayden would withdraw his rider and stick with the Central Arizona Project bill as passed by the Senate , Aspinall 's committee would take it up first thing next session . " This is all I ever wanted , " responded Hayden with a grin . <P> The old man , who shuffles haltingly around the Capitol with the aid of a mahogany cane , announced that he is feeling so politically spry he may well run against Barry Goldwater next year for an eighth term in the Senate .
