Next to the Paraguayan embassy 's main entrance on bustling Calle Via-monte in downtown Buenos Aires , a small , dark doorway ducks down into a forbidding , grottolike cellar . A bored cop stands guard outside , and some times passers-by stop to stare . For seven years , nine months , two weeks and a few odd days , the cellar has been home to Brothers Juan Carlos Cardoso , 46 , and Luis Amadeo Cardoso , 41 , making them easily the current champions in that treasured Latin American institution known as political asylum . Only Peru 's Victor Raul Haya de la Torre , who fled to the Colombian embassy in Lima in 1949 - holed up for five years , three months , four days - ever approached their record . <P> Electric Needle . " We have had many chances to escape , " says Juan Cardoso , " but if we were to leave now , it might be an admission of guilt . " For Argentines , an admission is hardly necessary . <P> When Dictator Juan Peron was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from the regime 's prisoners . Their prize persuader was the picana electrica , an " electric needle " that delivered a 12,000-volt jolt . Applied to the lips , soles of the feet or genitals , the picana made the victim convulse with shrieking pain , while leaving no marks . " With the picana " Juan Cardoso once boasted , " you can extract in one session confessions that would have taken four days of sissified questioning . " <P> For four years the brothers plied their trade . In 1952 Eva Peron gave Juan Cardoso a gold cup as " best detective of the year . " Then when Peron was finally ousted in 1955 , the boys hopped on a motorcycle , raced to the Paraguayan embassy and requested political asylum . The new Argentine government angrily demanded their return as common criminals . But the Paraguayans insisted that the Cardosos were political refugees . <P> All the Comforts . Meantime , the boys settled down in the embassy 's dank cellar . To keep from getting on each other 's nerves , they have partitioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom and two kitchenettes with refrigerators , rewired the lighting , painted the walls , added furniture , even acquired television sets . They do calisthenics to keep in shape , and to while away the days , they paint , write letters and read ( translations of Sherwood Anderson , Rousseau , Hemingway ) . The Paraguayan ambassador gives them money for food and clothes ; Juan picks up a little extra from a flower shop investment down the street ; Luis has a small appliance-repair business . In the evenings their families come by for dinner ; several nights a week their wives sleep in . <P> How long will their asylum last ? The two countries still argue over the brothers . Argentina refuses them safe conduct to Paraguay 's capital of Asuncion . Tiny Paraguay , eager to stand up to its big neighbor , is determined not to turn them over . The Cardosos grimly look forward to 1967 , when the statute of limitations should run out . Then , after twelve years in asylum , they hope to be free , having set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
