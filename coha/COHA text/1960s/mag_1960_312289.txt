Getting dress material that is sturdy and cheap is the perennial problem of the penniless Haitian peasant women . Traditionally , old flour sacks have filled the need . Now cloth dealers in Port-au-Prince have found a bountiful new supply of material : surplus U.S. 48-and 49-star flags . From shore to shore the island is bright with dresses , shirts and kerchiefs in the stars and stripes ; in peasant houses red , white and blue serves for sheets , pillow cases and tablecloths . <P> Purchased from Manhattan dealers , the uncut bolts of flags , generally the small , nonceremonial kind , are retailing for about 20 a yard . Port-au-Prince cloth merchants alone have already sold the equivalent of more than 1,000,000 Old Glories . Dealer Pierre Assad , who bought the flag material from Manhattan 's Philip Rothman at 12 a yard , also has bolts and bolts of Hungarian and Polish cloth , but says the U.S. flag " is beating the hell out of the Communist material . " <P> Though no longer useful for flags , the stars and stripes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desecration . In Washington last week Oregon Congressman Charles O. Porter introduced a bill to stop the manufacture , sale or gift of any type of U.S. flag where its use might " cast contempt . " It will probably go through , but until then , Haiti 's peasantry will continue to look like a Navy recruiting poster .
