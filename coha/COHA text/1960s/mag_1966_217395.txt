A gusty wind snapped in at 20 knots across Ohio 's Clinton County Air Force Base , but all systems were Go . " T minus seven and counting , " boomed the range officer 's bullhorn . " . . . Five , four , three , two , one-ignition ! " And with that , a 12-in. plastic , balsa and paper rocket zoomed aloft bearing a one-ounce payload of lead to the somewhat suborbital altitude of 800 ft . " Good shot , " cheered the range officer . " A good bird ! " <P> And so it went all last week as 80 amateur rocketeers , aged nine to 67 , fired off samples of their best hardware at the eighth national meet of the National Association of Rocketry . The 2,000-member organization was formed in the post-Sputnik days , had as its main aim the laying down of rules so that the hobby , which often proved fatal , would be safe as well as fun . Eight years ago , the N.A.R. estimates , homemade rockets were killing or maiming one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel and fire a backyard bird . Explosive mixtures of sulphur and zinc dust blinded and burned dozens of people ; lead pipes packed with match heads blew up like shrapnel in the inventors ' faces . <P> Exploding Confetti . N.A.R. laid down a safety code calling for the use of preloaded , factory-made model rocket engines instead of home-mixed propellants , recovery parachutes in the birds , and 13 other pointers on the gingerly care of miniature Titans . Among the strictures in the pledge : " My model rockets will not contain explosive warheads . " Wood and paper are specified as the safest materials for construction . " This way , " explains N.A.R. Executive Director James Kukowski , " even if an engine does explode , you get nothing but confetti . " <P> The amateurs ' payloads are small and the rockets peewee size . But enthusiasm and , among the teenagers , an astonishing ratio of intelligence to years , fires them with an ample lift . Last week at the N.A.R. meet , experts from NASA , the Army and the Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gemini-Titan constructed ( in a total of 300 man-hours ) on a 1-to-48 scale , complete with a two-man capsule . Sixteen-year-old Albert Kirchner of Bethpage , N.Y. , woomphed off a three-stage Little Joe II-Apollo test vehicle that cost him 200 hours of labor . A few pioneers are even sending aloft mice and grasshoppers , which successfully parachute back to earth at the end of the ride . <P> 1,500 Rockets . Fortunately for the amateurs , the hobby costs little more than their labor . Factory-built rocket kits sell from $1.25 to $15 . One-shot solid propellant engines , the largest of which can sustain thrust for two seconds , are available for as little as 25 . With prices like that and the pastime booming , amateur rocketry has become a small big business : Estes Industries of Penrose , Colo. , the largest of five manufacturers in the field , alone grosses about $1,300,000 a year . The present N.A.R. meet will make none of them the poorer ; by the time the week was over , some 1,500 more rocket engines had been blasted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
