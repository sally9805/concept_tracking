For most of U.S. industry , recent weeks have been rosy ones-a time for reporting the increased earnings that confirm that recovery is indeed under way . But in the midst of this happy chorus came an ear-splitting burst of cacophony-the news that giant General Dynamics . 15th largest industrial corporation in the U.S .. had suffered a first-half loss of $39.5 million . More sobering yet was the fact that General Dynamics was suffering from a difficulty that besets the biggest names in the commercial airframe industry . Cause of the trouble : the jet transport . <P> The high operating costs of the glamorous jets are bringing headaches to the airlines ( " TIME . July 21 ) . but the airlines ' woes are relatively bearable compared with those of the planemakers . For their manufacturers , jets have two almost insuperable drawbacks : 1 ) heavy development costs , and 2 ) inadequate markets . <P> In the U.S. , General Dynamics , Douglas Aircraft and Boeing Co. all rushed into a market that might have supported one or two of them in comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeds and complicated electronic gear , original cost estimates of the jets got left way behind . Said one airframe executive last week : " We 'd sound like damn fools if we told you what we first thought they would cost . " Talk of reaching a break-even point , where costs finally give way to profits , has now faded from the conversation . <P> Still Developing . General Dynamics , which was late getting into jets , has been hit with one of the highest product development costs in history . To develop its Convair 880 , 880M and the long-range 990 ( which is not yet certified by the Government ) , the company has spent $350 million . Of this , $116 million occurred unexpectedly this year , partly because of a wing-flutter problem in the 990 . So far . General Dynamics has sold 114 jets and delivered 38. many of which , through controversial maneuvers ( see below ) , have turned up in TWA 's fleet . General Dynamics Chairman Frank Pace Jr . gloomily predicts that " the potential commercial jet transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future sales . ' ' What 's more , warns Pace , the General Dynamics jet program will almost surely engender more " excess costs ' ' before it is finished . <P> By concentrating on fewer models than General Dynamics . Douglas has managed to keep its cost on the long-range DC-8 jet down to $292 million . But with 172 DC-8s sold and 146 delivered , a Douglas spokesman admits that " we 're still developing the plane . ' ' Back in the halcyon piston days , it cost Douglas only $42 million to bring forth the profitable DC-6 . In the last two years the DC-8 has hit Douglas with $53 million in losses after balancing the costs against profits from other divisions .
