A Christmas Dinner A story by Noel Mostert Lyle began to feel about Christmas that he was permanently lost somewhere in the long passage between the kitchen and the dining room of his Aunt Anna 's house , pivoting there with awkward gestures and murmurs of embarrassment , always standing aside for the purposes of others , for the trays of pineapple salad , cold duck and turkey , nuts and raisins , that went to the front , and the loads of glasses and silver and other things for cleaning that came out . There seemed nowhere else to go ; he was less in the way in the passage than in the dining room or kitchen , where the prevailing urgency spelled unmistakable exclusion . He felt in both of those places that true isolation of the outsider , of not knowing where things were , of being unable to respond to the constant exclamations for the objects that were missing or suddenly required . It was eleven and he had been in the house for over an hour already . This dejected floating between other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed , to the unreal journey from Tokai reformatory ; all the way out here through Capetown he had traveled blinking and self-conscious , as if the bright sunlight in which he worked shirtless every day were something as new and unfamiliar as his blue suit and tie . But the sense of the South African sun and the cool stillness before the heat of the day was different when he set out , though its quality and dove-laden murmur was indistinguishable in mood and modulation from all other days . Undoubtedly his being outside the gates made a difference in the mountains and in the surrounding vineyards and the pine forests he was used to , and he decided that it was the sound of his footsteps unaccompanied on the dusty road toward the bus stop , the absence of any voices around him ; the heaviness of the impending heat was sweet and languid instead of tense . But it was too still . He went through a world in which everything seemed somewhere else ; the people were busy with the special ceremonial of this day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the bus conductor said offhandedly , and this made Lyle feel less timid and intrusive . The bus was as empty as the road it traveled but there were colored-paper decorations inside to also remind him that it was Christmas . These , although dirty and torn , did not seem as perfunctory as those above the silent , watchful meals at the school , so that he went on with a mingled sense of skepticism and expectation ; afraid of the unfamiliar , of the heavy responsibility of being alone and for every gesture he made and syllable he uttered . When he 'd left and gone out through the main hall , past the principal 's office , Mr. Hendriks had called him in . The principal was dressed as he normally was on a Sunday , in khaki shorts and with a short-sleeved open-neck shirt , and he was sucking a pipe . His two small daughters were there with him , nursing new dolls . Mr. Hendriks was a lean and athletic man ; his eyes were sharp and flat as a detective 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not an unkind man . " You 're going to behave yourself , are n't you ? " " Yes , sir . " The last time you got probation you did n't . " Mr. Hendriks was studying him carefully . He was n't accusing or doubting , just recalling a fact which seemed to have some relevance . " Your relatives are good people . I know their minister . You know , it was good of your aunt to phone and ask for you . So you mus ' jus ' behave yourself , man . Jus ' behave yourself and have a good time . " " Yes , sir . " The strain of his fears that somehow he would n't already had given him a slight headache and Lyle decided to leave the corridor and go outside . He went onto the verandah , but here too he was in the way , awkwardly on the fringe of the boisterous greeting incoming guests got as they burst through the small front gate , with gifts held high in arms outstretched for exultant embrace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkened corner of the hall and sat holding his head in his hands , gazing at the floor and the frayed carpet with its design of camels and rampant lions . " Is anything the matter , Lyle ? " His Aunt Anna had approached him unaware and he jumped quickly to his feet . " No , " he said . " Are you enjoying yourself ? " " Oh yes , thank you . " " Well . I 'm glad they let you come . We very much wanted to have you . I do n't suppose it 's very nice staying there . " " No , " She regarded him intently . " Do they .. . do they bully you much ? " " No . " " The man I spoke to , the principal , he seemed very nice , He said you 've done very well lately and that you 've been very good . Very quiet . That 's why they let you come today . He said you 're going out to St. Michael 's home next month . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes . " " What are they going to teach you ? " " Electrician . " " Would you like that ? " " I do n't know ; I suppose so . " " Is there anything special you 'd like to do now ? " " Have you got any books ? " She hesitated . " Well , we 've got some nice books here you can look at , if you want to . Your uncle bought the Encyclopaedia , Britannica . It 's in the front , but be sure to wash your hands first . Do you read a lot there ? " " They do n't have many books . " " You must make yourself at home ; we 're one happy family here . " " Oh , I do feel at home , thank you . " " Good . " The word was a crisp satisfaction with duty done but something else occurred to her . " We 'd have liked to have had you here instead of going to the home , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be free to come and visit us on Sundays though . " " Thank you very much , that 'll be nice . " Noel Mostert , a Canadian citizen and journalist whose magazine work takes him from Tangiers to Toronto and points between , regards himself as a South African writer because he was born and educated there . He is writing a novel set in the U. S. , where he feels he spent the most formative part of his life . " Oh ... Heavens ! Where do you people come from so suddenly ? " She had turned to greet a raucous invasion . There was momentary bedlam . Lyle drifted behind them into the kitchen , where one of the new arrivals , a woman in black Sunday best and pearls , was dancing excitedly from one foot to the other , and then cried to Anna , " Here let 's give you a hand . We 'll wash up and let Minnie get on with what she 's doing . " Minnie , the Malay maid , was standing scowling at the sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see this pudding first . " " It 's beautifully done . You 're so good at puddings . Mine never come out . " " I do n't know what I 'm doing anymore , what with everything . " She gave Lyle an involuntary glance and was immediately embarrassed . The other woman looked as well . " Is this Mary 's boy ? " she cried in the same , sharp voice . " Are you Jimmy ? But you 've grown ! My God , " Jimmy was Anna 's grandchild . " No , " Anna said . " This is my nephew , Lyle . He 's Julia 's son . You remember Julia ? Lyle 's come for the day . " She swallowed some further explanation and then called across the kitchen , " Lyle , get Auntie the cake forks , please . You 'll find them in the dining room , in the sideboard . " He went with a rush , as though success or failure of the elaborate preparations in that hot , hissing , and littered kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creams , and icings. were dependent upon imminent arrival of the forks . An older cousin was standing on a chair in the dining room hanging decorations . He began opening the sideboard drawers and she paused , holding a mass of red streamers which looped out from the ceiling centerpiece , a great scarlet paper bell . " What are you looking for ? " she asked sharply . " Auntie Anna wants the cake forks . " " Oh . They 're in the top drawer there . No , the other one . Not those . Yes , those . " She watched him until he had taken the forks out , closed the drawer and started for the door . He was about to rush back down the corridor when a familiar instinct stopped his pace and set his heart beating . He knew they were talking about him at the end . He went down the corridor casualty , but skillfully silent . He stood quietly outside the kitchen door . Their voices retreated toward the oven , strengthened back to the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God knows . Not that anyone cares . " a story by Noel Mostert 71 " And Julia ? " " In Johannesburg , last I heard . I did n't ask him , but I do n't think he knows either . I do n't honestly want to know myself anymore where she or any of them are . It 's your own flesh and blood but there 's a limit . " " You 've done very well , I think . It was good of you to have him today . " " The man at the reformatory called and asked us to have him  --  I do n't know how he knew about us . Those people always seem to know things . So of course I said yes . One could n't very well refuse , could one ? He said they wanted to let him out of there next month and that the outing would do him good . " " Yes , but . . . " The conversation dropped to whispers . Lyle entered . " Here are the forks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anna beamed , and the other woman smiled , her eyes going to and fro across his face , as if to read some story there . Lyle said , " Excuse me , please , " and went out into the hall . He felt a taste of sickness in his mouth . The children were moving into the house and they went solemnly past him ; they were coming from some point in the garden , where they had been hovering distractedly , restrained by their party clothes and absorbed in the malice of their various comparisons , one 's toys against another 's . They entered in clusters , squeezing through the door , and with their quick movements and laughter they shook loose from their shoulders and shining hair the fragments of sunlight that still lay upon them , like bits of golden straw . They were all much younger than Lyle and they ignored him for this , also for that instinctive refusal in the community of the very young of association with the lost or isolated . He both envied and resented them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day . The children had not been summoned , but a sure sense of the order and ritual of the occasion now brought them forward . An army of small masters , they advanced upon the lounge to exercise their prerogatives . The tree was there of course . They moved unerringly to the various knees and laps that awaited them , and when they had settled , silent beneath the hubbub overhead , they fixed their attention upon the tree , scanning its base for new deposits from the late arrivals . There was a mound of new stuff , all of it lavishly wrapped , and the room 's ambrosial mist , a fragrance of Eau de Cologne , lavender , candle 72 A CHRISTMAS DINNER wax , mince pies and cigars , resin , new clothes and unbroken shoe leather , and brilliantine , seemed to emanate from there . Corks popped and each bottle apparently contained a gust of imprisoned laughter that burst into the room , foamed joyously around the walls , and then was reflectively amber . " I should n't really . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say when . " " Oh that 's fine , thank you . " " How about you people ? " " Fill ' em up . Fill ' em up . " " They can say what they like , this is as good as French champagne any day . " " Good old South Africa . " Another round of gift-giving began for the children , who went forward like victors and returned with expressions of vanity and smug triumph to parental fuss . Lyle retreated into his corner . Anna earlier had given him a pullover and a box of handkerchiefs but he felt now that he should be out of sight , that there was some obligation to avoid touching their conscience with this round , especially since the older children were going up as well . The distribution was soon over , however , and no one had noticed him . There was great hilarity . Anna entered with a tray of gingerbeer for the children . She served them all and was about to leave when someone near Lyle called out , " You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you there , Lyle , " she said , with genuine concern . " Would you like some too ? " " Of course he does . Too young for champagne . " The glass came across . The room seemed heavily silent as he accepted it , without looking at anyone . " Lyle 's going to trade school soon ; he 's going to be an electrician , " Anna said , to no apparent purpose , but as though in apology to Lyle . Various people said , " Hmmm , " or " Really ? " and smiled in Lyle 's direction . All the children turned to stare , examining him gravely , as though there were some extra qualification for attention which they had somehowomitted from their own calculations for the day . " That 's a good trade . You 'll make good money when you 're qualified , " one man said seriously , with that solemn tone used in addressing boys on a man-to-man basis . There were further murmurs of agreement . The gingerbeer glass was soothingly cold and Lyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , slowly , to and fro . When the glass was warm he drank the gingerbeer . But it was then too sweet and he could n't finish it . His hands grew steadily stickier ; he was embarrassed to put the glass down . There was a movement , a stir , groups forming and reforming , higher , sharper laughter from all ; and then most of the people were gone . Those who remained became involved in an argument in the center of the room . Anna was protesting , " Oh , we ca n't now . We 're going to eat soon . What about this afternoon ? " " Rubbish . It 's early . You 're not going to have it hot anyway . So come along . If the kids get hungry there 's masses at our place . They 'll eat again , do n't you worry . " " No really , I do n't think so , " Anna said . " Look how many there are of us . What about you , John ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the word . " He was a big man and his face was red from the morning 's steady drinking . He was grinning happily , content to let others settle it all . So long as there was another drink , somewhere , soon . The woman who earlier had been in the kitchen with Anna said , " Nonsense , you 're all coming . It 's your turn to sit down for a while . " " Oh well , all right . Only for an hour . " " Let 's go . " Anna said . " You 'd better comb your hair a bit , Lyle . You 've been rubbing it . " He said , " Would you mind if I went for a walk or something or sat on the verandah until you come back ? " " Do n't you want to go ? We 're all going . " " I 've got a headache . " " Oh , dear , " Anna said . " It does n't matter , you can lock up , " Lyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , it 's all right . Minnie 's got to stay here and clean up anyway , " Anna said , and then looked thoughtful , as if reassessing her decision . " Is n't he coming ? " the other woman asked . " No , " Anna said . " He 's got a headache . " " Oh , " the woman said . " Oh , " and she looked at Anna . " Minnie 's going to be here , " Anna said again , reassuring herself . They left without further questions , and Lyle listened to the sounds of their departure . He stood around listlessly . The Malay woman was cleaning up the mess in the lounge , stacking glasses and clearing ashtrays . He stood in the doorway watching her but she paid no attention and when she had finished straightening the cushions and drawing the curtains against the heat she pressed silently past him and went out into the backyard to her room . He heard its door slam distantly . She would probably sleep until called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left alone like this . The house was alarmingly empty , though still filled with its Christmas spice . He now fervently wished he had gone with them . His next regret was that he had come at all , the loneliness in the mess and the dormitories at least was familiar . In the dining room the great array of prepared food lay pensive under the cheesecloths spread to keep off the flies . It was a sumptuous silence here , and over it now and then there flicked a flash of complementary color from the balloons on the ceiling as they caught some brief light when the curtains stirred from the merest breath outside . The salads  --  potato with grated pineapple , orange , crayfish and avocado , egg , papaya , and so many more  --  stood deep and undisturbed in their bowls , around vases crammed with pro-teas , roses , and chrysanthemums . There were cold turkeys , a suckling pig , sliced ham , duckling , various jellied meats , sweets , candied watermelon , fruits , raisins , nuts . There were Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyle had never seen anything like it . He wanted to pick something up , a nut , a sweet , and to eat it and break this spell of unreal anticipation , to convince himself of its intended gaiety . But he was afraid . He could n't . He wandered onto the verandah and the tight there was so fierce by this time that it blinded him and set his head throbbing violently again . Below the verandah the houses fell toward a story by Noel Mostert 73 Table Bay in a dazzling avalanche of whitewash and red tile . Out beyond the whaleback hump of Robben Island in the center of the bay the sun hammered silver from the sea . You could see the long shadowed creases of the South Atlantic swell moving in with slow appraisal of the shore , searching where to break . There was no movement in the harbor below , no tug adrift ; two Union-Castle mailships stood dozing in their elegant dress of lavender and red and black , lending a tone that seemed specially festive for the day . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person was a Cape Colored , who sat on the edge of the pavement near the front of the house , his head sunk upon his arms , lost in thought or sleep . Then a double-decker bus came by , half-empty , and two blond boys a little older than Lyle got off . They were in khaki shorts and carried their bathing suits wrapped in towels . Their hair was still wet from the sea . A woman simultaneously appeared on the verandah of a house up the road , summoned no doubt by the sound of the bus , and she beckoned . " We 're waiting , " she called cheerfully , and the boys broke into a run and disappeared inside . Lyle and the Cape Colored once more were the only ones left adrift amongst these dense , preoccupied suburban houses . The street was quite empty , and so was the road that traversed the sun-burned expanse of Green Point common far below , near the docks . Later , when they had slept the insensible sleep of summer heat and heavy dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the motorists would pass down there , and up here , in a fast and steady stream , renewing the morning 's rounds of visits . But only later . Now there was this hush of Christmas noon , heavier than any Sunday ; a hush of heat and unblemished sky which he somberly considered while the silence of the house behind him itself grew deeper . But there was no solace in this stillness and its blue-white beauty . He felt only a great sense of absence , himself from somewhere : the only man outside the caves , beyond the feast . For the first time that day Lyle wondered about his parents and some other Christmas that might have been his ; felt for that moment as though he had been misdirected , that there was indeed another Christmas that was his , that they were waiting for him as that woman had been waiting for her sons . But the day seemed to grow only more still and indrawn , absolute in its emptiness Judgments by William Stafford I accuse Ellen : you have become forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gracious , thoughtful , a secretary . Ellen , I accuse . George You know how to help others ; you manage a school . You never let fear or pride or faltering plans break your control , George , I accuse . I accuse Tom : you have found a role ; now you meet all kinds of people and let them find the truth of your eminence ; you need not push . Oh , Tom , I do accuse .

I see it all too well And I am accused , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observant of these . There was a flare of gramophone music from somewhere , swiftly reduced . Laughter . Lyle rose and then , from some compulsion , went out onto the street and up to the colored man . He touched him on the shoulder and the man looked up quickly . His eyes were alert , as though he had anticipated the approach and expected some sort of interference with his meditation . " Hello , " Lyle said . " Hello , " the man said . He was young . About twenty . He looked at Lyle steadily . " I thought something might be the matter , " Lyle said , " Oh , " the man said , and his expression relaxed . " I sat down and I fell asleep . " He yawned . " What 's the time ? " " Going on for one . " " Christ , " the man said . " I should 've been aboard ship by now . We sail at three , and I 've missed my dinner . " He shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . I 've got a terrible hangover . I started walking from Hunt Bay when the sun came up . I did n't even have my bus fare left . That 's a long way to walk . How many miles ? " " Du n no . " " I 'd say seven . " " I do n't know how far it is . " " Are n't you having Christmas ? " " Yes . " Lyle said . " Do you live here ? " " I 've just come for the day . " " Where ? " " There . " " Other people there ? " " They 've all gone out . " " Can you do me a favor then ? " " I 'll try . What 's it ? " " Get me a drink of water please , man . There 's nowhere I can get a drink . " " Sure , " Lyle said . He went across to the house and found a tin mug he remembered the Malay woman using . Beside it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the household dishes , were her plates and utensils as well . There was a Christmas cracker and a paper hat beside them today . He carried the water back carefully and the man put it back with a single gulp . " Ah , " he said . " That was good . " He frowned . " You ca n't go to a caf ? or a European house for a drink because they think you 've come to steal and they chase you or call the dogs . So what do you do ? Thank you very much , that was really a favor . " " Would you like some more ? " " I would , " the man said . " I really would . " He rose slowly to his feet and dejectedly examined his clothes and started brushing them off with his hands . He was well dressed but the suit was crumpled and dusty . " The first time I have this suit on , look what it 's like . It cost me ten quid . That 's one thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He sighed . " Oh well , I 've got lots of time to clean it . " " Where are you going ? "
