MY LIE AS A SOVIET PRISONER T he prison was an ancient , ugly f ? ? rtress with massive brick walls , rusted iron bars at its grimy windows , and dank , dark corridors . It was said to have been built in the 1700 's , during the reign of Catherine the Great ; now it was Minsk Prison No. 1 in the vast Soviet penal system . Our cell was No. 43. a cubicle scarcely large enough to hold our two bunks. two benches and table . Its concrete walls constantly seemed to be pressing in on us , and the door was precisely like those I had seen a few weeks earlier . at Leningrad 's infamous Peter-Paul dungeon , where many Czarist political prisoners spent their last days . It was a ponderous wooden slab pierced only by a peephole and a trapdoor called a kormoshka , through which food was passed . A rusty can stood in one corner of the cell . for we were permitted two  --  and only two  --  trips down the corridor to the toilet each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  we were n't permitted to lie down before 10 P.m. ? trying to doze through the dreary October afternoon , when the thump of heavy boots in the corridor woke me from my reverie . I opened one of the books I had been allowed to keep . The guard lingered at the peephole , humming softly , and my cellmate , a middle-aged Russian engineer named Maxim , grimaced . " That 's enough ; knock it off , " Maxim said . " Did n't your boss tell you not to disturb the animals ? " There was a moment 's silence ; then the guard forced a laugh . " Take it easy , old boy , I 'm just doing my work . Keep losing your head like that and you 'll find yourself in prison . " He stomped to the next cell , laughing at his own wit . Maxim looked up from his notebook . Had I seen him on a Russian street , in hat and coat , I might have taken him for a high-school teacher . But now he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head shaved to the skull  --  like mine . Head-shaving prisoners is an old custom originally instituted to prevent lice and now retained , according to Soviet prisoners , as a mark of humiliation . " Now 's your chance , " Maxim whispered in his slightly slurred Russian . " That guard 's lazy  --  he wo n't return for an hour . " Carefully , tenderly , I removed my new treasure from the lining of my jacket . During our hour in the exercise cage that morning , I had noticed that the peephole glass there was shattered . and while the guard patrolling the cages was approaching the far end of the catwalk , I worked loose a neat little sliver . It was an invaluable thing to have in a cramped cell , where the mind is constantly conjuring up little projects to occupy itself , projects always thwarted by the lack of any kind of tool . I polished the sliver on my pants , then began sharpening my pencil with it  --  slowly , enjoying the excitement of having something new and purposeful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notebooks . He had been convicted of embezzling building materials in a local construction project and he spent most of the day writing his life story , especially an analysis of his case . He planned to send the manuscript to the local edition of Pravda to " expose the rats who framed me . " We worked intently and did not hear the slight shuffle behind the door until it was too late . " Hey . you  --  Landerman . Get yourself over here . Move ! " It was the shout of another guard . who liked to sneak up to the peephole . " Give me that thing you were working with . " I played dumb . " 1 said give the thing here . All right , that 's better . Look . Landerman. do n't ever let me catch you playing with glass again , or trying to peek out the window like you did the other day , or you 're going to be in real trouble . " I slouched on the moldering bench again . closed my eyes  --  that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had been a mistake to waste the sliver sharpening a pencil . I had to develop more careful habits . I drifted into a daydream . I was back on that dark highway again , only this time there was no motorcyclist and no accident . I was free ; the whole thing had never happened . I was touring through Western Europe again . playing my guitar , combining two main interests  --  languages and folk songs . Then I was back in Riverside . Calif .. telling my friends at home what Russia is like . Then I was telling my parents not to worry . Finally , the old questions returned again : what am I doing here ? I did not doubt that God had a purpose in this , but it still seemed unbelievable that I was a prisoner in the Soviet Union . In my 22 years I had always been known as a " well behaved boy . " and a fairly good student . I had never thought I would even visit a prison ; yet here I was inside one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the value 1 placed on human life . I had sometimes wondered if I could bring myself to kill a man in a war over political differences . Now I found myself in the position of having killed a man for no reason . The accident had occurred 10 weeks earlier , on the evening of August 15 , 1963 . I was driving the first of two Microbuses packed with 12 American university students and a Soviet guide . We were searching for a campsite near N husk where we could spend the Iasi 1 .4 our six-wick Soviet tour . A cm . , . iched from the opposite directiim iesi I switched to parking lights , as our guide had instructed . Rut the Soviet driver held to his high beam , and I was dazzled for an instant . Then I saw an ( ild man walking an unlighted motor-cycle on my lane of the highway- too late to avoid a collision . The man died in a Minsk hospital live days later , and after a three-day trial I was convicted of causing his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . American experts on Soviet law have subsequently argued that I bore no criminal responsibility . since I had been specifically instructed to use parking lights  --  that had been the law until a few months earlier , and 90 percent of wl drivers still did ! - ; ( i . ' Set everything i could learn about sim iIar cases indicated that both the trial and the sentence billowed normal Soviet practice . Whether it was fair or noi , I was stunned by the sentence : three years in a corrective labor colony . I was taken , in a darkened , curtained paddy wagon guarded by armed soldiers , to Minsk Prison No . Ito await transfer to a labor colony . The date was September 27. 1963 ? just the time , give or take a day or two , when I had planned to start my first year as a graduate student in linguistics at LI.C.L.A . The prison was administered by the Soviet army , as is most of the Soviet penal system . The soldier-guards were coarse men of peasant upbringing . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the typical Russian manner . You know , " said a young Siberian who was doing his military service , " I could just as easily be in that cell myself ? it does n't Lake much to wind up in the pen . It 's just fate that it 's you and not me . " To me. " the Amerikanyets , " some guards were especially compassionate . They brought me a plywood board to cover the iron slats of my bunk ; they slipped me their copies of Pravda ; they gave me extra portions on the rare occasions we were served " treats " of gluey spaghetti or fried fish . Best of all , they would open the kormushka to talk with me for a few minutes only , since this was illegal ) . reassuring me that my sentence would be reduced , questioning me about life in America  --  for examprices and which ( Nev ? a never-end in VIM amazement . 111 ( T , other I tilfigS that helped make ilre bearable : a chess set in the ( .. ? n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ff1 in music and news ITISEnr ) of I he deadening propaganda ; permission lo have my language books and Fithje with me , and to use pencil and paper . We were free to pass most of the day reading , talking and day-dreaming , and we were never physically mistreated . And although the food was as grim as the cell itself -- each day , a ration of black bread , salted fish , two howls of cabbage soup with specks of meat or fat , and two helpings of grain mush called kasha  --  we were permitted to buy limited portions of jam . margarine and extra sugar on the rare occasions when they were available in the prison store , The prison doctor , a matronly woman with a gentle manner , even gave me permission to buy white bread , a luxury usually reserved for sick prisoners . Yet I soon began to feel some of the dehumanizing effect that confinement in a Soviet prison seems deliberately aimed to produce . It was not just the oppressiveness of our tomblike cell . the constant security checks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet prison authorities seem consumed by a passion for security . What was worse was their passion for secrecy , for keeping prisoners in a state of total dependence and total ignorance about their fate . The regulations forbid communication of any kind among inmates ; no prisoner was permitted even to catch sight of any other except his cellmate . Maxim and I were led to the toilet and exercise cage only when the corridors were empty . Aside from those trips , life was a string of endless . empty hours in the stark seclusion of the cell . At first I was naive enough to ask about my future . I appealed to officers and guards to telt me about my appeal . which colony I would be assigned to  --  anything at all about my case . " Sorry . Landerm an , we ca n't tell you . You 'll find out when the time comes . " I was cut off from everything and everyone I knew in the world . No one , not even the American consul in Moscow , knew where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write to my parents  --  they never did receive my first letters -- but I heard nothing from them for over a month . Finally , late in October , 18 letters . obviously opened , were delivered by a rep-representative of the foreign ministry . To my surprise , my captors seemed to regard me as a threat , and they reacted by searching me. watching me , and opening my mail . I did n't know what they feared in me ; perhaps they suspected / was an intelligence agent . Paradoxically , they forced me to develop the cautious habits of an agent . Their first rule was to tell me nothing , to keep me in suspense , to surprise me and wear me down , Alv first rule therefore became to outwit them  --  to plan all the angles , to keep myself aloof . to hoard . to be always on guard . and abovy all . not to tell them anything . This sell-imposed isolation flew in the face of everything I believed about the way people should behave . But it was essential for self-protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide , but they were making a challenge of my imprison111C111 : 111 ( 1. t'Vell II it meant dl awing into a shell 1 wanted to heal them at thou Ani11 Ilegan lo , glannt11 ( 1 terli mime that was e1 , tt inure delitintati ? mg .

Up at six a.m. to the Soviet national anthem , bread and sugar rations delivered through the kormushka , morning exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't force down , radio broadcasts distorting life in America , guards snarling with Maxim , head shaves every few days  --  and , thank God , my Bible and other books . I tried to force myself to follow a regular schedule of studying Greek . Czech and Russian , but it was hard to concentrate . There was no room to pace inside the cell . and Maxim was not interested in chess . There was little to do but wait . I drifted into a state of suspended animation which made the hours , then days and weeks , slip by . until it seemed as if I had languished in that cell for years . At dawn on November 5 , after almost six weeks in this prison , an officer flung open the kormushka . " Lander-man ! Get your things together " ? the words that all prisoners know mean they are being transferred . " Where am I going ? " " 1 do n't know . " I was escorted into a windowless paddy wagon ; then , together with scores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then back into a paddy wagon , and finally into an unheated cell in Smolensk Prison No . I ? 300 miles northeast of Minsk . After five cold days and nights alone there , I was moved again . A converted bus jammed with prisoners drove us through what seemed like back streets to a railroad station , where we waited for several hours in the dark . Our train arrived after midnight , and we were marched in columns past soldiers with submachine guns and police dogs . We marched along a line of ordinary freight cars until we came to one with frosted windows covered by rusted bars . Inside the prison car , most of the cages were filled with men and women , giggling and weeping , exchanging hits of herring and cigarettes . shouting . shrieking . swearing and singing . Although there were no leg chains or starving prisoners , I was reminded of the scenes of convict transfers described a century earlier by Tolstoy . Most of the cages held a dozen or more prisoners . but I was quartered alone . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other prisoners , and as the train pulled out from the station . I settled down on the wooden bench provided for sleeping . Then . through the din of Russian shouts and the clanging of the train . I heard an incredible sound . " Pete ! Pete ! Are you around here ? " It was a man 's voice , shouting in English  --  with a Brooklyn accent ! I shouted something in return . " Pete  --  hello . I 'm an American  --  across the corridor , two cages down , I heard you were on this train . " I felt a surge of elation . It was an American , a friend , someone I could trust at last ! His name was Nick Nedin. he told me , and he was serving a five-year term . I got my first look at him next morning when the train pulled into Moscow : a man apparently in his late 30 's , wearing brand-new Levis and a button-down shirt . He had a racking cough and a look of deep anxiety . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the many used to hold prisoners in transit , he whispered his story . He was , he explained , a Polish Jew who fled to Russia when Hitler invaded Poland . After internment in a Soviet concentration camp . he emigrated to America in 1946 , got his degree in shipbuilding engineering , became a citizen , married , and went to work in the merchant marine . In 1961 , while returning home from a tourist trip to Russia , he exchanged a few East German marks for rubles with a Soviet army officer . He was arrested al Minsk and interrogated by the K.G.B . ( Soviet State Security ) , which tried to make him confess to espionage . Nick refused , and endured four months of questioning . At his trial , however , the prosecutor said his real crime was not exchanging Soviet currency but spying , and Nick was sentenced to five years , two in a K.G.B . prison in Minsk , and three in the colony to which we were traveling . " Good grief , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " I 'm all right . And now it 's great , is n't it . Pete ? We 're going to be together from now on . Tell me everything new in the States . " Although the guards at the transfer prisons had orders to separate us . Nick persuaded them to put us in the same cells for the remainder of the trip . He was a compulsive talker , and as we rode in prison cars and slept on the floors of empty transfer cells , I was happy to listen to his homesick tales of America . But the habits of secrecy and suspicion that I had developed in prison warned me not to trust him . It was not simply the fantastic coincidence that the two Americans in Soviet confinement for nonpolitical crimes and I had been told repeatedly that I was the only one ) were traveling in the same train to the same colony . There was also Nick 's story : the more he talked about it , the more it sounded concocted . Why did he want rubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union ? And how did he know the precise location of our colony ? He even pointed it out on an atlas he claimed to have bought while in prison , though no map would have survived the first search in any Soviet prison . let alone be on sale there . ) How had he known my name ? I tested his IC knowledge with a few s:emingl , al questions i I had majored in 11i , L11 chemistry and Spanish in ? 4 f was convinced he had tie , ? . tit engineer . He talked a great tit 4bout his case , but some of his f.u , ations sounded phony . about the embassy in Mosco ' . ' I asked . " Have you been in touch with them ? " " Oh , they know about my case , but those lazy bums have n't lifted a finger to help me . " But twrhaps he was just being careful with me . After all , he spoke English fluently , and he had a wide knowledge of Americana. supported by photographs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could these be the products of a counterespionage agency ? Was he actually an unfortunate American  --  or might he be a K.G.B . " plant " assigned to report on me ? I hated to believe that of this man with his arm around my shoulders while he talked nostalgically about hot dogs in Yankee Stadium . But I had to be careful . Why did he seem unsure of his own story ? And try to sound so persuasive ? How could lie take our fabulously coincidental meeting so much in stride ? By the time we left the Moscow prison , I had decided he was a spy . Or was this just what the Russians wanted ? Were they trying to break me down ? Was I becoming paranoid ? I could n't decide anything about Nick except that his presence , far from breaking my feeling of isolation . only intensified it . He was a threat  --  the most serious threat so far  --  and I would have to double my precautions . I wished that I had n't met him  --  and that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison cars rolled east from Moscow , stopping at rail junctions , where we were herded into paddy wagons and driven along incredibly rutted roads to our transfer prisons . Fifteen days after my departure from Minsk we arrived at a small rural depot . and as we were unloaded , I got my first inkling of the colony 's atmosphere and terrain . The road was a ribbon of mud through thick birch forests . Everything had the primitive look of rural Russia . We were marched to the colony which . with its crude stake-and-barbed-wire fences , floodlights and wooden guard towers . looked like a copy of the concentration camps of World War II . The camp commandant . a scrawny colonel with bitter eyes , glanced at our documents , put a few questions about our backgrounds , and barked a series of orders in a tone implying we had cheated him of something . Then . after a search that included every page of every book , I was questioned by an officer who exuded suspicion . " I need not say . Landerman , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to behave according to the principles of this institution . I do not expect you to do anything unwise . " When my documents were complete . I walked to the barracks that I expected to be my new home for nearly three years . There were 300 prisoners , all foreigners or stateless men . in Colony No. 5 , which was reserved exclusively for non-Soviet convicts . There were Greeks who had fought as Communist guerrillas after World War II . Iranians who had slipped over the border seeking a better life . Koreans who had lived on the 1,1and of saltlaihn roil lb() Korritu 1-11 ; e. 1 mint -0 ; taken Iron ) their ' Ionia ( ( nab children during the Civil Vi ; ? ? ( .1 had immigrated to the Sm 1 man , and a smattering of Chines ( -I ern Europeans and others v.1 ) . lehow had conic to the Soviet 1 ... 11 ( .. 11 hey were old and young . bitter and happy-go-lucky. and their crimes ran the gamut of the Soviet criminal code , from petty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was reserved for foreigners . Colony No. 5 apparently did not differ significantly from colonies for Russian convicts . Most of my fellow prisoners had spent the better part of their lives in the Soviet Union and had no intention  --  or hope  --  of leaving . They considered themselves Soviet citizens in all but documents . The barracks were crude , but well lit , freshly painted and immaculate . Our bunks were comfortable cots with mattresses of wood shavings . We received fresh linen . a bath and a head-shave every 10 days . Reveille sounded at six aat. ? and again , the Soviet national anthem . The barracks came to life slowly with curses and trips to the hole in the ground called a latrine . and by seven o'clock we walked to the mess hall for breakfast of thin soup and a piece of black bread . Back in the barracks . we had our first tea of the day . " Tea " was roasted millet grain boiled in water on the wood-burning stove , and often we had boiled potatoes , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to sneak some out for us . It was accompanied by bread and whatever treats  --  butter , jam . fatback , tinned fish  --  we might have been lucky enough to receive in packages or to buy in the camp store . This was a social ritual of great Unpin lance : Thee oi tome ! twill Is would sit together on a kiwis hunk and share whatever they had , even if only a dab of margarine . The workday began at right A.M. , and we worked eight luaus a day , Monday Iluough Saturday , at our iob of constructing camp buildings , Evenings and Sundays we Were free to move around the barracks and visit others in the compound . Guards rarely appeared here  --  the watch at the guard towers and gates was redoubled in the evening  --  and our free time was spent in an easy atmosphere of relaxation and gossip . There were chess and domino games . occasional movies , private phonographs and speakers for Radio Moscow , newspapers , old magazines and even a few yellowed library books . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent along with me when I left Minsk  --  made me something of a favorite among the prisoners : Almost every evening a group would gather at my bunk while I answered requests for songs and memorized new ones . Nick continued to hover by my side at first , but the more I saw of him the less I wanted to . He hesitated , and changed his story , and the more he talked , the fishier it sounded . He was constantly probing for information in subtle ways : How did I feel about the Soviet system ? What was my attitude toward Communism ? What were my political affiliations in the States ? I developed the habit of talking in generalities , and telling him nothing , for I now felt certain he was reporting to the administration . Perhaps he was not a K.G.B . agent , but I could not believe he was who he said he was , and this made our relationship painful . Within a week or so I had settled into the camp routine . Living conditions Sparlan , bat not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aryl guns , the colony might almost have passed for a primitive work camp in any frontier area . Then , early in December , I was audlen y shipped hack to Moscow by train . No mine would tell me where I was going or why , but since I had just received a letter from the Byelorussian Supreme Soviet suggesting that I request a pardon , I assumed I was about to be freed . When I was delivered to a prison in Moscow , however , and read the plaque at the entrance , I felt the first pangs of real fear . It was a special prison for those under investigation by the K.G.B . For a week I was kept in total isolation , allowed to see no one but a few silent guards . There was no radio and no conversation . The windows of my cell were frosted and the corridor outside it was thickly carpeted to muffle the movements of the guards . Nevertheless 1 knew that I was under constant observation , for when I began kneading some of my black bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unendurably oppressive hours , a guard was inside the cell almost instantaneously , demanding to know what I was doing . I was not permitted to use pen or pencil , and my eyeglasses were removed from the cell every evening . presumably to prevent my using broken glass as a means of committing suicide during the night . There was absolutely no communication with anyone  --  not even a smile . That week was the most terrifying of my life . No one would answer my requests to explain why I was there , and I could only assume an espionage charge was being concocted against me . I tried to prepare myself for the ordeal of interrogations ; the K.G.B . was said to be masterful at extracting confessions . After a few days 1 di ask alsllit my fate . IP inIarlireted as it Sir , 07111 on my part . ( Icy I iecemhcr NI I was driven to an millice in downtown Moscow ? Still no one offered o - word of explanation . II was only I heard i he familiar voice of Poop Klemtittne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I understood I had been brought to Moscow for an interview with a representative of the embassy . was warned that any mention of where I was confined and what I had been doing was forbidden . Despite my inability to talk about anything that had happened since I had last seen Mr. Klemsline , it was a great relief to be talking to him rather than to a K.G.B . interrogator . Obviously the only purpose of the interview was to prove that I was alive and in good health . When I arrived hack at Colony No. 5 ? on January 3 , 1964 ? it was the dead of winter ; nothing moved in the frozen countryside except the wind and ourselves . Each morning at eight . we stuffed a piece of bread under our shirts , pulled on our felt boots . thick caps and quilted jackets and trousers  --  which were fairly warm , even on those bitter days  --  and gathered at the main gate . There , we were counted several times . matched to our photographs , and marched off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns and police dogs . The rules stipulated marching three abreast with no talking or smoking . but as we tramped through the deep snow the column melted into a straggly mass. with everyone talking and smoking . The sergeant tried to maintain order . " Come on , get in line . Hey you  --  move up . UP . damn it . Get in a column all of you , or I 'm going to get tough . " " Take it easy , man , " answered one of the older prisoners . " Who pushed your button today ? " The prisoners at the head of the column began teasing one of the young soldiers , a dark , dashing Uzbek nicknamed " Tashkent . " " Hey . Tashkent . look out . I 'm going to make a break for it . " Tashkent flashed his white teeth . " What a shame . Sick of living already . at your tender age . " My brigade ( 20 prisoners/ had been assigned previously to constructing visiting rooms where wives who travel to the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now we were deep in the forest . chopping , splitting and stacking birch logs for firewood . We arrived with frozen faces and built a lire while the soldiers set up stakes to mark the limits of our work area . They stood guard at the corners . but since they were responsible only for our security ? they usually paid no attention to how we worked . This was typical Soviet bureaucracy : The soldiers on duty outside the camp compound answered not to the camp administration but to a nearby army outpost . ) We dawdled before the tire for a half hour while our brigade leader , a " senior " prisoner , tried to coax us to work . " Let 's get something done today . you fellows . You 'll freeze to death out here . " But there was no compelling reason to work hard except for an empty threat by the camp officers to reduce our food rations , and we spent about a third of the morning warming ourselves and gossiping around the fire . The work was heavy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Poor quality of our tools than anything else . There was a quota for our daily output of firewood , but it was so ludicrously high that no one even bothered to try to fulfill it . At noon we marched back to the mess hall for lunch Icabbage soup again . and some sort of kasha ) and the afternoon at work was much the same as the morning . On one afternoon I particularly remember we persuaded the guards to start us back to the compound at 4:30 instead of 5. and walked quickly to beat the other brigades to the gate . There , while waiting our turn to be searched , we picked out of the snow the potatoes that had been dropped there for us by the vegetable-storage brigade , and hid the potatoes in our clothes to smuggle in . But the search was unusually thorough on this afternoon , and most of the potatoes were discovered . Worse : A guard found my most treasured possession , a little notebook in which I was transcribing prison songs , inside my shirt . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song mocking the Soviet judiciary- then looked up at me. and I was certain that he was going to confiscate the notebook . Finally . however , he returned it , warning , " Don ' t he fooling around with songs when you 're supposed to be working . " We trudged on and were back in the barracks in time for " tea " ? today without boiled potatoes  --  before going to supper . In many respects , the camp was more humane than the closed prisons . Although the environment , especially the food , was drab and crude , there were just enough human comforts to make the confinement tolerable . And just enough toleration of our infractions to keep us from becoming desperate . Most of the infractions involved smuggling  --  from the outside by bribing guards and other " free souls . " such as the camp nurses . and from the inside by stealing from camp supplies . In February the smuggling of vegetables from the storeroom swelled from a trickle to a steady stream , and the fame of an adventurer named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potato thief , swelled correspondingly . Fasi was a skinny , incredibly wrinkled old Afghan who had crossed the Soviet border illegally to seek his fortune . He said he had been employed as the snake catcher on a collective farm in Kazakstan when he was convicted for " selling his daughter " ? which meant he had accepted a dowry for her hand , in keeping with Afghan custom . How much of this one could believe was always in question , not only because Fasi hardly spoke Russian but also because he was considered either slightly mad or a fine actor . One of his favorite rules was that of an angry soldier . He would put on a canvas cape that looked like a soldier 's overcoat , carry a stout stick like a submachine gun and shout orders to the guards , who loved his act . Fasi always arranged to be last in his brigade through the gate , often slipping by without a search . If a guard did begin to search him , he would whine . " I 'm a devout Moslem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would steal ! " Even after the guards had learned of his reputation and had begun marching him thoroughly . they never found anything . One morning in April . Fasi 's brigade leader , who was known as the camp 's great stool pigeon , saw him stuffing a half-dozen potatoes into his felt boots  --  and quietly told the hiding place to the guards at the gate . That evening they searched Fasi painstakingly . while he protested in self-righteous indignation . " OK , Fasi , hand them over . " Citizen Lieutenant . I 'm an honest man , I fear Allah . You have hurt me deeply by suggesting such a thing . " " Time 's up , Fasi . Now take off your boots . " " It 's cold , Citizen Lieutenant , my feet will freeze . I never stole a crust in my life , I swear . , . " Two guards collared him , dumped him into the snow and pulled at his boots . Pleading and protesting , Fasi tried desperately to hold them on his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of potatoes fell from each into the snow . Guards and prisoners laughed to the point of exhaustion . Fasi 's adventures were the subject of discussion at the " political instruction " meeting that Thursday evening in the barracks . These meetings were supposedly Marxist-Leninist seminars on world and colony affairs . ( Camp commandant : " You men know you are members of a criminal element which is dying in Soviet society .

" How come there 's no jam in the store - not even sugar ? " ... " What 's this new idea of marching us to work early ? " That Thursday the colonel summoned Iasi to his side during the meeting and lectured him with mock seriousness . " Now . Fasi , you have been shouting to the skies you are an honest man . What 's this report I have about stealing potatoes ? " " Citizen Commandant , that was the first time in my life , the first time . I swear I do n't know how all those dirty things got inside my boots . " Even the colonel cracked a smile . The soldiers had orders to stop the stealing , of course , but they were not overzealous about carrying them out . Most of them treated us as fellow men rather than inferiors ; and many went out of their way to show sympathy for the Amerikanyets when their superiors were absent . Even the guards who suspected I was a spy treated me kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in this place for a traffic accident . " said one of them . " Well . do n't feel bad , Petya . I suppose if I were spying for my country I would n't want to talk either . " Of course , some guards were more arrogant than others , but I saw no instances of physical mistreatment. sadism or brutality . Sometimes prisoners were defiant , and some of the hardened professional criminals would curse guards and officers and refuse for days to go to work . This usually resulted in their confinement in the unheated . unfurnished punishment cells , but the guards rarely resorted to physical violence . They seemed carefully instructed not to use force , and the prisoners had lost their fear of it . To some extent , we were protected against flagrant mistreatment , for one characteristic of Soviet penology is an elaborate system of protest to higher authority . Protests could be sent  --  and many were sent  --  by letter to judicial officials or higher army authorities outside the camp . But there was a simpler method : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin closed prisons , they entered every cell once a month ) and they were available to all prisoners to advise about legal questions and listen to complaints . The authorities apparently were legally obligated to hear all complaints , and the prisoners were not afraid to voice them , even in the presence of administration officers . There is a great deal of emphasis on " the prisoner has the right to ... " in Soviet prisons , in word if not in deed . and the prisoners took their rights seriously . They were quick to protest when they felt their rights  --  concerning food rations , for example  --  were being violated . The authorities sometimes acted on the protests and sometimes did not ; but they usually at least investigated and wrote reports . More important . the knowledge that ! trial old easily be made to higher , indeoa aaa it authorities kept the administration from blatantly infringing prisoners rights . In this sense , there was a surprising emphasis on " legality " in the camp 's operation . I was often told that Khrushchev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once were horribly mistreated and had no means of protest . " Look . " said an old Spanish prisoner . " this place is a rest home compared to what it was under Stalin . " Still , as time passed , I felt more and more isolated as a human being . I developed friendly relationships with many fellow prisoners and guards , but of course there was no one I could trust The entire camp was permeated with this spirit of distrust ; I had encountered it on the day I arrived , back in November , 1963 . A Korean prisoner appointed as our barracks " captain " had taken me aside to whisper : " Let me give you some good advice . Petya : do n't trust anyone around here . If you 're smart , you 'll keep to yourself and keep your mouth shut . You have no friends in this place . " It was good advice , even though given for the wrong reasons . For I coil ( ' trust him least of all . As I soon learned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ) . one of a network that operated in every brigade and every barracks in the colony . The atmosphere was like tl , at of George Onvell 's 1984 : Big Brother was watching me always through the eyes and ears of my closest " friends . " And even if the man in the adjoining cot was not a sfirkach , Big Brother still triumphed  --  because I had to assume that he was . The stoolies provided the administration with a steady stream of reports about prisoners ' attitudes and infractions  --  for instance , " Landerman has a file and he 's using it to make crosses from soup bones " ( which I was , for fellow prisoners who wanted to wear them ) . In return , the administration provided its stoolies with favors such as easy jobs , positions of authority . and glowing reports about their " rehabilitation , " which sometimes led to reductions in their sentences . Sensing my suspicion of him , my " fellow American " Nick Nedin had drifted away , but others took his place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk to the mess hall with me. invite me to tea , or simply to sit on my bunk and question me quite unsubtly about my attitudes and past . " I hate Communism , Petya. how about you ? " I soon realized that they were sent not only to inform on me , but also to persuade me not to talk about the outside world . especially about America " Let me give you some good advice . pal . " said a half-Chinese halt-Russian bully . " Do n't say anything about America . If somebody asks you how much a car costs say you do n't know . This is n't the place to tell the truth ; you 'll save yourself a lot of trouble . " Being Ow only American in a large Romp of people was n't a new experience for me : my father had worked as an agricultural adviser in the foreign-aid program . I spent many of my childhood years abroad . attending local schools , arid I could understand much of the criticism of the United States that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived , their members were often so boorish , so full of sermons about the American Way of Life , that I was self-conscious about being a " Yankee . " Now , again , being an American made me self-conscious . But this time my nationality made me proud  --  and bitter . Proud , because most of the other prisoners respected me simply because I was an American . Bitter because of the vicious lies about my country that I heard from the stoolies , in the political broadcasts on the radio , and at the weekly political meetings . I could n't let the lies pass unchallenged ; I felt an obligation to defend my country , and I know that many of the prisoners relied on me to do so . I was not an agitator , and at home had not even been much interested in politics , but American principles had become more important to me than ever . and it was my duty to uphold them . On the other hand , I was wary . Apprehension had become my way of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times I felt that I was less forthright than I should have been . And I found myself caught between other opposing forces . Life in a labor camp strips away almost all the privacy . the pretense and conventions of ordinary life , leaving the character bare . The human capacity for good and evil . for selflessness and selfishness . was intensified by our primitive living conditions . Some prisoners were vultures . eager to sell themselves and anyone else for a ball-point pen or a jar of jam . They were masters of the " camp approach , " interested only in separating me from my belongings as quickly as possible . 1 " For your own sake . Petya , better let me have your phonograph records for safekeeping . Your barracks are full of thieves . " . . . " Look old buddy , I 've got great contacts who can get us bacon and cheese through the walls . If you let me have that razor of yours , I 'll see that you 're treated like a prince . I warn you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ) On the other hand . there were prisoners who would share their last ounce of jam purely out of generosity . I had developed a circle of friends in camp . and although there was no one I could trust with my thoughts , their daily companionship helped make life bearable , Most of my friends were young : a Chinese musician who played a fabulous gypsy violin ; a happy-go-lucky Iranian for whom I carried on a **28;2700;TOOLONG with a Russian girl who had placed an advertisement in a magazine asking for an English-speaking pen pal ; a Greek boy who was convicted of " parasitism " because he quit his job for six months to devote himself to painting ; another Greek who , like me. had killed a man in a traffic accident which did not seem to be his fault . I can not mention some of the must likable prisoners because they are easily identifiable . Several of my closest friends said , " Petya , he sure to write about this when you 're back home  --  but please . never mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , and their misfortunes seemed to nourish , rather than stifle , their generous instincts . As a Christian . I had been aware of the battle between good and evil . But here the contrast was sharper and more real than I had ever seen . More important , I saw the forces of good and evil struggling within myself . On one hand , there was the inclination to be generous and selfless  --  to share my belongings and the contents of the food packages that irregularly arrived . My friends were not Russian , but they had the Russian habit of sharing everything : They distributed the contents of their packages . even when these came but once a year : they shared the potatoes and carrots stolen from storerooms and smuggled into the barracks despite searches . They contributed their prize belongings  --  a shirt or a pen ? to " dress up " a prisoner about to be liberated . I took part in this sharing too . But 1 also found in myself a disturbing inclination to be stingy , to save for myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent me by the American Embassy . I was besieged by requests and hungry looks . But " why waste it on others ? " I sometimes heard myself asking . " You 're hungry ; save it for yourself . " And sometimes I did . I considered myself a Christian . Yet here I was thinking about my own gratification , hoarding my own little pile of candy , which was so delicious when bitten in tiny lumps with a mouthful of sour black bread . We were not starving  --  I had lost some 20 pounds at first but now my system had accustomed itself to the routine . Still , food supplies , packages , lumps of sugar  --  material things  --  occupied an importance in my thoughts far out of proportion to what I would have hoped . I hated the instincts which made me withdraw , to calculate and protect my own sources of supply rather than think about the welfare of others . And I realized that my violent distaste for the selfishness of the " vulture " prisoners was partly a distaste for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " Thou condemnest thyself ; for thou that judgest doest the same things . " One learns more about oneself in prison than one does about the prison system ? and not all of it is flattering . Months passed , and camp life seemed more and more " normal " ? which meant , I suppose , that I was becoming less and less so . I felt a curious sense of detachment : part of me was prisoner Landerman. splitting logs for the Soviet state and scraping the last spoonful of kwha from my Ism ! It was all so very familiar ; home seemed to be only a dream . something that did n't really exist . But when letters arrived from home ? usually in packets of six or more  --  it would suddenly spring back to life . Then , when I looked around at the barbed wire , the guard towers and the frozen landscape , I would feel again my old sensation of bewilderment , of " What am I doing here ? " In February the work grew harder  --  we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rations less adequate . Now it was no longer a question of the food 's drabness ; there was simply not enough . The amount of each prisoner 's daily ration was posted prominently in the mess hall . but like many regulations . it was observed in letter . but not in spirit . Our daily 50 grams of meat was interpreted to mean that weight wherever hacked from a carcass  --  bone . gristle and hooves included . Two hundred grams of potatoes was half skin and dirt . Feeling hungry even after finishing a " meal " became the rule rather than the exception . The camp gossip centered around food  --  and stories of escape . a topic that took on special importance after the events of one frozen night . Sometime after midnight a squad of soldiers entered the barracks , ordered everyone dressed and lined us up outside . Distressed-looking officers checked and rechecked us against our photographs . Within minutes everyone knew that three young prisoners were missing . " I wish them luck ? " sighed a wasted former Polish officer beside me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do it . they can . " We were confined to the compound for two days while platoons of soldiers conducted a feverish search 7 The break was so clean that the administration was convinced the prisoners were hiding inside the camp . The soldiers herded us from barracks to barracks , scouring the buildings . even tearing up floorboards . Before sending us back to work on the third day . officers tried to spread the rumor that the escapees had been caught the usual practice . I was told . is to parade recaptured escapees in camp before sending them to trial , Other rumors had it that a soldier on watch during the escape had been executed and , months later . that the escapees were caught working on a collective farm in Georgia . Many tales of spectacular escapes were spun by older prisoners . but never heard one in which escapees re-mained free more than two years .

But somehow I was intrigued by this primitive toil : I would have thought that it belonged to another century . Our next jobs were housekeeping tasks near the compound , easy enough to permit loafing half the day . Late in April . when the snow had disappeared at last , we returned to the forest to trim the areas we had cut in winter . We were deep in that typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to understand the Russians ' fierce love for their countryside . The sun was strong , flowers were blossoming everywhere , the air smelled of warm earth and trees , and those days , far from the barracks and barbed wire , were almost pleasant . We dozed and gossiped most of the day , drank cool . sweet sap from fresh birch stumps . and then dozed again in the sun . " Landerman  --  pack your things , you 're leaving . " This long-awaited yet fearful order came after just such a day . when I least expected it . I felt neither fear nor elation ? however , only renewed apprehension and determination to prepare for whatever was coming . Of course . no one would tell what that might be . Shipped back to Moscow , I was entombed alone in yet another prison ? Bit t irska ya . The mont hs passed as slowly as years ; after the activity and relative freedom of the colony , the isolation of a closed prison deadened my senses . And yet . so much had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way I was happy to be alone . I was the master , at least , of my own cell . The walls kept me in , but they also kept them out . I had fourpaces-by-two of freedom . When a guard sympathized that I might be lonely and suggested I might be given a cellmate , I recoiled . Surely anyone assigned as my cellmate would be a stoolie . I would have to play again the rck of the friendly , innocent fellow prisoner . while guarding my thoughts . In August of 1964 I was told again to pack my things . By then I was too numb . or too well trained , to ask where I was being sent . I prepared for the rst , but this time my place of conTxment turned out to be the " repatriation center . " It was a brick cottage inside the gates of Moscow 's Matroskaya Tishma Prison , where foreigners who have completed their sentences are confined while waiting for visas for repatriation abroad . " Does this mean I 'm free ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sorry . I can tell you nothing . " a K.G.H. captain said . " You will be told in time . You most learn to wait .

There is a Russian expression , tusk  --  e r dushe , which means melancholy , or depression , or wretchedness as only a Russian idiom could express it . Now I understood this " sadness in the soul . " On February 3 , 1965 , the captain showed me a document : a full pardon . for humanitarian considerations . from the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet . I suppose he expected thanks , but I was beyond feeling anything except distrust . The next morning , when he drove me to the passport office in downtown Moscow , I prepared myself for a trick  --  and I was not disappointed : The captain had brought me there hours before the American Embassy , was expecting my release , so that I might be interviewed by Soviet newsmen before I met representatives of the embassy and of the Western press . " Mr. Landerman , you 've just had a rather unpleasant experience in the Soviet Union . Tell us. what are your impressions of prison life ? You were treated correctly . is n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too confused and contradictory to answer in one breath . Yes . I had been treated " correctly " in a certain sense . I had not been treated more harshly than a Soviet prisoner would have been . But what I experienced in prison confirmed what I had observed , as a tourist . of Soviet life in general . Too many of the country 's accomplishments are robbed of meaning by an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and distrust . The human spirit is corroded and shrunken by the need to be forever on guard . The official obsession with secrecy and subterfuge forces people to build a wall between their private thoughts and public fa  --  ades . And for what ? At noon on February 4. 16 months and 7 days after I had been sentenced . a grinning American diplomat met me. and we drove away in a peculiarly unreal American car to a disturbingly lavish lunch at the embassy . The next night I stepped off a plane at Kennedy , International Airport , in New York , onto American soil . I know now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Soviet prisoner , that the experience has helped me develop maturity and understanding . Fellow prisoners had told me , in all sincerity , that no one could really understand what life is all about until he had spent at least a year in prison . is a graduate school better than al a could find in the States . " I when I first returned . I felt only withered and narrowed . uneasy and disoriented . After such a long confinement , the relief of liberation did not burst upon me in a single stroke . I did not want to talk to anyone just then , or to think about my future . I wanted to be alone , to walk alone down a long city street . That is the effect of dehumanization.
