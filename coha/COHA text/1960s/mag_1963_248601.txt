Items : <P> &gt; Splitting along party lines ( three Democrats to two Republicans ) , the Civil Aeronautics Board rejected a merger proposal by Eastern and American airlines to form the nation 's largest domestic airline .

" The refusal left Eastern in a grave financial state . Faced with withering over-competition and crippled by a recent flight engineers ' strike , it has suffered a pretax loss of $60.3 million in the past three years , including a $3,100,000 loss last month . The CAB believes that Eastern can survive , but it may now have to help out by reducing competition on some of Eastern 's routes . <P> &gt; Hard-pressed Northeast Airlines faced the loss of six jetliners and nine turboprop planes .

He obviously hopes to find a merger partner , but since Northeast is staggering under a $60 million debt , a merger may be difficult to arrange .
