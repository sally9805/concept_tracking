txt Mitchell I. Ginsberg , the city 's Human Resources Administrator , is working on plans to set up a welfare research council that would sponsor studies to find answers to rising welfare problems . Mr. Ginsberg said in an interview yesterday that he was seeking private support to start the agency , which would operate like the city 's Health Research Council . The health agency , with both official and private members , has been using city and state funds to make grants since 1958 . It has pioneered , for instance , in research on methadone to counter drug addiction . Some projects Mr. Ginsberg has in mind would study the effect of the new employment incentive program for welfare recipients , the question whether relief dependency goes on to second and third generations of adults , and the effectiveness of referrals of women on welfare to family-planning services . With welfare bills already running more than $1-billion a year here , Mr. Ginsberg said that " no business of any comparable size could operate without an effective information system , isqme- means of determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's activities . " M. Ginsberg , who was sworn in xii his present ' post Dec. 5 after 22 months as the city 's welfare chief , is also naming the ' first director of research and evaluatidn for the Human Resources Administration . Effective Feb. 1 , the position is to go to William C. Lawrence , 46 years old , who has been chief of the evaluation branch of the community action program for the Federal Office of Economic Opportunity since the program started in 1946 . He formerly taught community organizing at the Columbia University School of Social Work , served with the Mobilization for Youth research unit and spent a year with the President 's Committee on Juvenile Delinquency . Seeks $300,000 to Start Mr. Ginsberg has asked for $300 ; 000 in city ? expense budget funds for the year starting JulY1 to start the research and evaluation program to supervise such efforts for all his administration 's components , the Social Services Department and the Manpower and Career Development , Community Development , Youth Service and Addiction Services Agencies . For the Social Services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialists . The former Welfare Department has had some money for two research specialists , and has also used the CitylJniversity 's Center for Social Research as a research arm . A. to the projected welfare research council , Mr. Ginsberg saicyt ' e had been talking with foundations that appeared interested . He estimated that a first7 ; year effort might need $300,000 to $500,000 . His idea is for " a much smaller , tighter , less elaborate structure " than the Health Research Council , with the welfare body including community representatives and only himself and a couple of other Human Resources Administration members from the city side . The health council , headed by Dr. Colin , consists of nine city ; officials and 42 unpaid appointees of the Mayor . Started with $600,000 in city funds , it has had as much ash $8-million a year ? shared equally by the city and state ? j to distribute in grants to public and ' private researchers . Dr. Marion C. Morris , assistant scientific director , said yesterday that " for every dollar the Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council are receiving six times as much support from others . " Current support is going to studies of environmental pollution and delivery of medical care , she said . In welfare , Mr. Ginsberg has discussed projects to study how the employment incentive program works out . Begun , last Sept. 1 , this lets welfare recipients get jobs and keep the first $85 they earn each month , then reducing their welfare grants by 70 per cent of earnings beyond this $85 ? instead of taking all earnings as in the past . A project , which Mr. Ginsberg thinks might be done out of the city 's available records for $50,000 , could explore whether relief does in fact pass on to the second and third generations and develop " a pattern of going on and off the rolls . " Another study could explore how the caseload builds up ? the eligibles in the population , the impact on clients and the community , the influence of such services as day care and job training . Only about 4 per cent of relief recipients have lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates 90 per cent were born here or had lived here at least five years . But the question is whether migrants , driven from the South by poverty and harsh conditions , may hold jobs for only a year or two and then lose them for lack of skills . Only about 5 per cent of relief recipients are considered " presumptively employable men , " but the estimate is that their lack of employment or underemployment may affect family members to involve over-all 20 per cent of the persons on relief . Projected studies of health problems , lack of skills and work attitudes of both men and women would aim to develop specific services to improve their employability . A family planning research proposal would aim at " introducing family planning methods to a sample not only of mothers who already have children but to teen-agers who by virtue of their cultural location tend to be relatively high risks for impregnation . " A lesser order of priority has been suggested for studies of nutritional patterns , and how they may be changed , and the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
