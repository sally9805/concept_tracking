Isabella of Castile is best known to history as the lady who , with King Ferdinand , backed Columbus on his voyage that led to the discovery of the New World . But in her time , the Spanish Queen was equally renowned as a patroness of the arts . At her bidding , Juan de Flandes and Miguel Sithium painted 47 miniature panels between 1498 and 1504 portraying the lives of Christ and Mary for her private chapel . All but two were probably by Juan de Flandes , a Fleming whose sophisticated fusion of courtliness and naivet , and languid , doll-like figures were much prized in the Northern European Renaissance . Painter Albrecht Drer , when he saw the panels in 1521 , exclaimed : " I have never seen the like for precision and excellence . " <P> Washington 's National Gallery of Art now offers a double opportunity to see what Drer was talking about . To a Sithium panel , acquired in 1964 , depicting The Assumption of the Virgin , the gallery has now added a companion piece from Isabella 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ , bought at auction last June in London for $161,700 . Beside the overly saccharine Sithium , the 8-in. by 6-in. miniature by De Flandes is indeed a gem of sprightly precision . <P> It depicts the devil , disguised as a monk but revealed for what he is by his horns and cloven foot , tempting Christ three times ( the second two temptations are shown in mini-miniature in the background ) . The principal scene shows the devil in the wilderness offering Christ a rock and boldly challenging him to turn the stone into bread . Christ resists the temptation , and one can almost hear the famous words " Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God . " For a Queen , it was doubtless meant as a gentle reminder that if divinity resists temptation , then so must royalty .
