Director Billy Wilder , fresh off the boat from Europe and without a bean in his pocket , picked up his first salary check in Hollywood by hiring out as a stunt man and jumping into a swimming pool in full fig . Since that day , he has splashed about so energetically in the cinema swim that now he is established beyond question as one of Hollywood 's most successful screenwriters , as a director who ranks with George Stevens ( The Diary of Anne Frank ) , William Wyler ( Ben Hur ) and Fred Zinneman ( A Nun 's Story ) in the Big Four , and as a witsnapper , fathead-shrinker , Sunset Boulevardier and allround character who has achieved notoriety not often rivaled in movieland . <P> Having made 23 Hollywood pictures , most of them commercial successes , Wilder has been nominated 18 times for Academy Awards and won three , for Lost Weekend ( director and coauthor ) and Sunset Boulevard ( co-author ) . Says he with a snarl : " I was robbed 15 times . " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted Williams ever did . " <P> Nevertheless , in the opinion of many critics , it was only last year , in the magnificent locker-room farce called Some Like It Hot , which rang up the biggest gross ( $14 million ) ever achieved by a Hollywood comedy , that Wilder revealed himself at his wildest and most wonderful . <P> Last week , with the release of The Apartment , which opened in Manhattan to rave reviews ( " trenchant " . . . " sardonic " . . . " tumbling with wit " . . . " the most sophisticated movie I have ever seen " ) , Moviemaker Wilder obviously had another big hit on his hands . He also raised some intriguing questions in the minds of his audience about what , if anything , he is trying to say . <P> Berlin Accent . The Apartment has its moments of sentimentality , even soap opera , when the heroine tries suicide for love of a married man . It has moments of sharp , watercooler burlesque as it glances at an office Christmas party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice little guy whose bosse 's use his apartment as launching pad for some fairly sordid affairs , the picture takes on a hard , unwinking look of irony . Again and again , Wilder seems to speak in the accents of one of his favorite cities , prewar Berlin , a tough , sardonic , sometimes wryly sentimental place whose intellectual symbol was Bertolt Brecht . Is Billy trying to say something serious about men and women , heels and heroes ? Is he as a sort of puritanical pander , trying to instruct as he entertains ? <P> Wilder himself backs away from the question with alarm . Says he : " I want to be truthful , but if I have to choose between truth and entertainment , I will always choose entertainment . I have a vast and terrible desire never to bore . " <P> Billy almost never does , on screen or off . Inside a head that makes him look like a benevolent old bullfrog resides a restless imagination , a " flypaper memory " and a wit that ranges from the merry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who first said : " Wait till I slip out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini . " He is also the author of this scathing epigram : " I would worship the ground you walk on if you lived in a better neighborhood . "
