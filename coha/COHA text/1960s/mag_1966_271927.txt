As they do at countless collegiate parties everywhere , the couples wriggled to the watusi and gyrated to the jerk , while recorded drums and saxophones resounded in the dimly lit apartment of a University of California student in Berkeley . Unlike parties most anywhere , however , the boys and girls were naked . After a while some of the couples drifted into bedrooms . Some embraced in darkened corners . <P> First it was free speech , then filthy speech . Now it is free love , as students , former students and nonstudents continue to test the limits of the permissible at Berkeley . There have been at least six such orgies , attended by between 20 and 45 youths each , in the San Francisco Bay area in the past month . All have been held in private residences . Most have included students from Cal and from San Francisco State . <P> The promoters of nude parties contend that their motivation is intellectual and philosophical , not merely sensual . Nonstudent Richard Thome , 29 , a Negro who heads an off-campus East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only become free when he can overcome his own guilt and when society stops trying to manage his sex life for him . " His idea of freedom is parties in which individuals can engage in any sexual act " that does n't impose on the desire of other people . " <P> Not Everything Goes . On campus , the approach is somewhat different . At Berkeley , 30 " card-carrying members " of the University of California Sexual Freedom Forum man one of the many campus propaganda tables , where they sell buttons reading TAKE IT OFF and I 'M WILLING IF YOU ARE . They distribute pamphlets on birth control , abortion and venereal disease , have lectured on these subjects with university approval . University officials turned down as " educationally irrelevant " the group 's request to show a nudist movie . " I reject the notion that anything goes on this campus , " said Berkeley Chancellor Roger Heyns . " I seriously doubt that this is a violation of anyone 's freedom . " <P> The president of the campus group , Sociology Freshman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct should be : " Do I want to do it ? Does it hurt anyone else ? " The group 's secretary , Psychology Student Holly Tannen , a bright 18-year-old who enrolled at Cal at 16 , contends that suppressing sexual expression leads to " pornography and topless night clubs . " She concedes she was embarrassed at her first nude party . " I was ashamed of my body , " she said . " But I got over that . " <P> Naked Wade-In . The free-sex movement has been growing slowly in various parts of the country since March 1964 , when Dr. Leo Koch , a biology teacher who in 1960 was fired by the University of Illinois for advocating premarital sex , and Jefferson Poland , a restless student who says he is studying to be " either a lawyer or an agitator , " founded the New York City League for Sexual Freedom . Poland , who now attends Merritt Junior College in Oakland , took the offensive for nudism by wading naked into the ocean at San Francisco 's Aquatic Park last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sexual Freedom League , Ina Saslow and Shirley Einsiedel . All were arrested . The girls got suspended sentences , and Poland was sent to jail for five weekends .
