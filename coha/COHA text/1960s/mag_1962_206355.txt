By midafternoon , the carpets had not been tacked , some of the seats were not bolted down , the stair railings were still being sanded . Six hours later , after some 800 hired limousines had converged on the area , braying their way through the clogged streets . New York Philharmonic Conductor Leonard Bernstein mounted the podium , bowed to the audience and Mrs. John F. Kennedy , and set the hall ablaze with sound . There would be better nights of music at Philharmonic Hall-the opening night 's program was more an acoustical than an artistic success-but there would be no nights more glittering or more laden with meaning . Manhattan 's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts was at last a going concern , the 120-year-old Philharmonic at last had a permanent home , and the world of music had a new hall that could stand comparison with the very best . <P> Barnum-Sized Bushel . As the first building completed in the 14-acre , $142 million Lincoln Center complex , Philharmonic Hall attracted to its stage last week a Barnum-sized bushel of musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the Philharmonic but also three choruses ( the Juilliard , Schola Cantorum , and Columbus Boychoir ) and twelve top-priced soloists , including Tenors Richard Tucker and Jon Vickers , Soprano Eileen Farrell and Mezzo-Soprano Shirley Verrett-Carter .

But of the four new works , Barber 's seemed most likely to survive in the repertory . A busy , intricate piece , it blazed with melody and bristled with ideas . The audience gave it , and Composer Barber , a standing ovation in the most spontaneous accolade of the week . <P>
