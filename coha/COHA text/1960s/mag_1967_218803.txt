When it comes to turning out great college and pro football players , few high schools can match the record of Dallas ' Highland Park High-the school that produced Bobby Layne and Doak Walker . <P> This year Highland Park has a new star : a straw-haired 16-year-old who is practically a one-man ball club . Play ing quarterback on offense , he has completed 56% of his passes ; on the ground , he has gained 705 yds. in 102 carries . He is his team 's top scorer , with 83 points . On defense , he plays safety , has intercepted nine passes . He also punts ( for an average of 33 yds. ) , kicks off , boots extra points and field goals . His performance against Turner High three weeks ago was typical . With Highland Park trailing 27-13 in the fourth quarter , he 1 ) threw a 12-yd. touchdown pass , 2 ) passed again for a two-point conversion , 3 ) ran for another TD , and 4 ) kicked the extra point . Final score : Highland Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story all over again last week , when Highland Park closed out its season by beating Denison High , 21-14 . He gained 105 yds. on twelve carries , scored one touchdown , kicked the extra points and intercepted three passes on defense . <P> A B-student who plans to become an engineer , the youngster currently is being courted by recruiters from no fewer than six colleges : Southern Methodist , Texas , Texas A. &; M. , Texas Christian , Baylor and Navy . All of which makes his father-who was once a pretty fair country ballplayer himself-immensely proud . The boy 's name : Kyle Rote Jr .
