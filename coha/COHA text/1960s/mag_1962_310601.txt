The toastmaster began the evening with a typical toastmaster 's gag : " Before I cut my throat . . . " Not one of the 200 special guests interrupted him with a laugh . Not one of them could . Actor William Gargan was playing toastmaster in Memphis for the International Association of Laryngectomees-people who have lost their larynges to cancer . Their laughter was muted to a barely audible chuckle . <P> Toastmaster Gargan was particularly sensitive to their plight . His own voice had been his livelihood in a career devoted to the stage , movies and TV . Then , while touring with the road company of The Best Man two years ago , playing the role of an ex-President who dies of cancer , Gargan himself began to complain of a continually sore throat . Doctors discovered he had cancer of the larynx . His voice box was removed , and what was left of his windpipe now ends at a collar-button-level hole in his neck . When he left the hospital , he was speechless . But last week , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more-using esophageal speech . <P> Swallowing Air . In natural speech , air from the lungs is exhaled through the windpipe ( trachea ) , past the " vocal cords " ( membranes of the larynx ) . If these membranes are tensed and vibrated , a tone is produced . That tone and its timbre are modified by the tongue , teeth and lips to make the different sounds of speech . In the laryngectomee , the exhaled air escapes through the hole in his neck ( tracheostomy ) where his Adam 's apple used to be . But air can also be swallowed through the gullet ( esophagus ) and burped back again . And the swallowing muscles at the top of the gullet can be made to vibrate . As a result they give a lower tone . In the 1930 's , a few laryngectomees discovered that they could produce speech of a sort by swallowing air and controlling their burps . Temple University 's Dr. Nathaniel Martin Levin , now practicing in Miami , systematized the method ( TIME , Dec. 4 , 1939 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer of the larynx is curable with early diagnosis and modern surgery in 60% of cases , and 2,000 patients are operated on every year , the number of U.S. laryngectomees is growing fast-so fast , in fact , that the American Cancer Society , which sponsors the I.A.L. , has trouble finding enough therapists to train the recovered patients , who like to call themselves " The Lost Chords . " The danger is that they will become just that , and permanently , if they are allowed to wallow in their early discouragement . <P> The best teachers are laryngectomees themselves , especially those who were voice-conscious before they had cancer . And among the many at Memphis , the teacher with the best record was a slight , bright-eyed grandmother of nine from Newton , Mass. , Mary Doehler , 71 , widow of a chain-store executive , had been an aspiring soprano in her youth and had taught children with speech problems . <P> When cancer cost her her own vocal cords in 1944 , Mrs. Doehler not only taught herself esophageal speech but set about perfecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handbook on the technique ( it has just been translated into Japanese ) , and has taught no fewer than 1,300 laryngectomees herself , mostly at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary .
