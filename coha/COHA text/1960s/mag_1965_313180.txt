The whole world loves a lover - which probably accounts for the fact that people are forever doing favors for Paul ( " Golden Boy " ) Hornung , 29 . Paul is properly grateful . In his autobiography , Football and the Single Man ( Doubleday ; $4.95 ) , the ex-Notre Dame star and veteran Green Bay Packers halfback does his best to repay everybody who , as he puts it , " contributed to making Paul Hornung , like Wyatt Earp , a legend in his own time . " <P> It is quite a list . First come the sportswriters , who awarded him the Heisman Trophy as the U.S. 's No. 1 college player in 1956 , after he sparked Notre Dame 's Fighting Irish to their worst ( two wins , eight losses ) season in history . There is Paul 's mother , who pounded a typewriter for the WPA in Louisville after his father left home in 1939 , and cut corners all one year to buy him a $48 bicycle for Christmas . " I rode it up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was it . " <P> Then there is the " friendly , friendly " college recruiter who offered him 1 ) $10,000 in cash , 2 ) a new car , and 3 ) not one but two free scholarships ( the other was for the girl of his choice ) to play ball at some place other than Notre Dame . Roman Catholic Hornung had to refuse : " If I had n't , there would n't be a priest in Louisville who would talk to me . " South Bend , as it turned out , was n't such a bad place after all . Paul drove a car on campus in violation of the rules , and he learned to save his class cuts for long weekends that extended through Monday and Tuesday . <P> Paree &; the Black Books . Thanks to his friends , Hornung 's whole life has been one long weekend , and " every day is Derby Day . " While he was still a junior at Notre Dame , a " bachelor millionaire " named Abe Samuels introduced Paul to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned pro , a pinball-machine operator named Barney Shapiro staked him to a Las Vegas trip and handled his weekly bets ( up to $300 ) on pro football games . When Paul was suspended in 1963 for gambling , Governor Endicott Peabody of Massachusetts made a speech in his behalf . Wisconsin 's Senator Alexander Wiley did his best to get Paul deferred from the Army , and when that failed , President Kennedy intervened to get him a pass so that he could play in the 1961 championship game against the New York Giants . Paul scored 19 points in that game and won a Corvette for his performance . " If John F. Kennedy had n't made the call he had , " Hornung writes , " I would n't have played and would n't have won a $5,000 automobile ... I loved that man . "
