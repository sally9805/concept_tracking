The two folk greats met at Northwestern University one autumn evening in 1956 , just at the start of the great campus folk revival , and sat down to tell the kids- and the tape recorder - all about it . Broonzy , then 59 ( he died in 1958 ) , recalled the days when he and Bessie Smith sang in Mississippi , punctuating his anecdotes with his guitar . So good are the songs ( Green Corn , Back water Blues , Why Do n't You Come Home , Bill Bailey , Midnight Special ) that , after the first interlude of conversation , the talk is distracting . <P> INTRODUCING THE BEERS FAMILY ( Columbia ) . The Beers family of Montana-father , mother , teen-age daughter-is dedicated to pure folk music , mostly Irish and Scotch songs taught to Robert Beers by his pioneer grandfather . In addition to the fiddle , guitar , dulcimer and psaltery , the Beerses work the " limberjacks " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular in colonial times ) and " beat the straws " by banging on dulcimer strings with a spear of buffalo grass . The most beautiful of these seldom-heard instruments is the ethereal psaltery ; the record stopper is Evelyne Beers singing an old Scotch ballad Dumbarton 's Drums , while the sound of the psaltery sways like silver leaves in the wind .
