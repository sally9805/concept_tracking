Not that crisis is to be recommended , but there is nothing like a real , full blown , to-the-brink international flap to clear the air of confusion . Crisis can , in fact , impose its own orderliness , washing away irrelevancies , clarifying issues in black and white terms , mobilizing national resource and purpose , setting in train a predictable sequence of action and reaction . <P> <P> Throughout most of the cold war years , the world has lived in a state of constantly recurring crisis . So accustomed have so many become to the condition that its absence can cause a vague sense of unease . Cyprus ? Guantanamo ? Panama ? South Viet Nam ? East Africa ? Malaysia ? All are trouble spots . But taken separately or even together , they do not quite seem to spell CRISIS . Feeling this , the average newsreader is likely to have certain qualms and begin to wonder if something is n't really going on that he ought to know about and be able to worry about . <P> Domino Theory . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of seemingly eternal verities . Communism was a monolith and therefore all the more powerful , dangerous-and , for some reason , efficient . The domino theory guided U.S. foreign policy . If Greece fell , so would Turkey , then most of the Middle East . If Laos went , so , like a row of dominoes , would South Viet Nam , Thailand and the rest of Southeast Asia . Any Communist action had to be met instantly and decisively by Western reaction . All this led to a certain predictability of policy . <P> That predictability is now lacking . For one thing , some of the old verities no longer seem so true . The Communist world is not monolithic , and Russia 's Khrushchev is beset by economic and political difficulties that would make any Western statesman blanch with dismay ( see cover story in THE WORLD ) . Moreover , in recent months new men have become heads of government in three of the West 's four most powerful nations . Konrad Adenauer , Harold Macmillan , and even John Kennedy in his relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges could be foretold with considerable accuracy . But Ludwig Erhard , Sir Alec Douglas-Home and Lyndon Johnson are not bound by the policies-or for that matter the shibboleths-of their predecessors . All are feeling their way , seeking new foreign-policy avenues , and their course is difficult to predict . <P> Masterpiece of Blandness . Last week , for example , Britain 's Prime Minister flew to Washington to visit the President of the U.S. Sir Alec and Lyndon got along famously-up to a point . <P> <P> Their communique was a masterpiece of blandness . Home solemnly pledged Britain 's support of U.S. policy in South Viet Nam ; Johnson automatically reaffirmed U.S. support of Britain 's desire for " the peaceful national independence of Malaysia . " And together the two nations would continue the " pursuit of peace " for all they were worth .
