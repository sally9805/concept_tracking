txt It is not really Bobby Baker who is under indictment in a federal court in Washington today , many observers feel here , but the United States Senate . Robert G. Baker , former page boy and secretary to the Senate Democrats , has been indicted by a federal grand jury on nine counts charging him with receiving $137,000 under false pretenses , and evading taxes on the money . Mr. Baker , it is pointed out here , came to the Senate at 14 , breathed its atmosphere , watched its members , and was conversant with its ethical standards . Furthermore , when the curious facts appeared of his sudden leap to affluence on a $19,600 a year income , the Democratic majority committee of the Senate that investigated him decided that he had not committed a crime , although he was guilty of " gross improprieties . " Reluctance noted There was hardly a reporter who followed the hearings who did not believe that the majority was reluctant to push the inquiry or , as the Republican minority charged , carried through a whitewash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-official at another point . After the committee hearing , the Senate had to decide what corrective action to take to prevent a recurrence . All the Senate did was to adopt a resolution to set up a joint commit tee on ethics . It rejected a proposal by the rules committee for financial disclosure and broader reform . For years , observers here have noted the stern code of ethics which Congress applies to presidential nominees to executive positions . A , series of Secretaries of Defense , for example , have been forced to divest themselves of financial interests in the business which they leave to come to Washington . npalitv accepted But Congress applies one rule to others and another to itself . A substantial minority of congressmen own stock in lucrative radio and TV stations in an industry which they regulate ; they carry on law firms whose clients are campaign contributors ; and in other ways , stand to profit by dual interests . The late Sen. Robert S. Kerr ( D ) of Oklahoma , an oil millionaire and a kind of uncrowned king of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no harm in it , and he was a chief patron of young Mr. Baker . Generations of reformers have urged Congress to put its house in order . Historians declare there has been a slow , steady improvement in ethics since the day when Daniel Webster used to dun the Bank of the United States for his customary retainers . Make-believe laws ? Rising costs of campaigning make the matter particularly acute now , it is charged . Present laws affecting campaign contributions are little more than make-believe , students assert . Besides this , Congress should apply the same code of ethics to itself that it applies to those whom it investigates . Repuhlicans hope to make political capital out of the Baker case . The forthcoming trial may involve the names of more senators , it is hinted . More than anyone else , curt , bulldog-mannered Sen. John J. Williams ( R ) of Delaware insisted on pushing the Baker case when other senators wanted to hush it up . Indictments do not tell the circumstances . A possible line of defense would be that Mr. Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't heard the last of the Bobby Baker case , nor the Senate either .
