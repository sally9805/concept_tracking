To heads of governments , currency devaluation is a devilish thing , to be resisted to the bitter end . It not only dam ages national pride but also depletes the pocketbooks of voters by forcing them to pay more for imported goods and foreign travel . Despite those draw backs , policymakers are becoming in creasingly interested in a scheme for making devaluations-and upward revaluations-fairly common . <P> <P> The plan has the particularly unattractive name of " crawling peg , " but it has a notably attractive list of advocates . It was popularized largely by Princeton Economist Fritz Machlup , and lately has been advocated , in one form or another , by German Economics Minister Karl Schiller , French Finance Minister Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Hendrik Houtthaker , a member of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers . Last week Guido Carli , governor of the Bank of Italy , also offered a crawling-peg plan . <P> Step by Step . The 25-year-old system that the crawling peg would change is based on fixed exchange rates , under which currencies are valued in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than 1% in foreign-exchange trading . Under the simplest form of crawling peg , if a currency were to sell for some months at the bottom of its 1% range , then its official value would automatically move down . On the other hand , if heavy demand were to make a currency sell persistently at the top of its range , its official value would be automatically raised . <P> If this system were already in effect , the disparity between the undervalued Deutsche Mark and the overvalued French franc , the most chronic source of monetary crisis , might well be reduced . The mark probably would have moved up in several steps from its present value of 25 , to 26 or 27 , and the franc would have gradually declined from 20 to around 18 or 19 . The Dutch guilder and Italian lira probably would have moved up too , while the British pound almost certainly would be worth less than its present $2.40 . The U.S. dollar would not have changed because it is the standard against which the other currencies are measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crawling-peg plans . Some would adjust exchange rates annually , some quarterly , some monthly . Other versions would make adjustments optional and not automatic-that is , at the discretion of each government . All advocates agree that it is essential to make the parity changes frequent but small-perhaps 1% to 2% yearly . Sup porters believe that , under such a system , the value of a country 's currency would reflect the realities of its balance of payments position and the amount of its inflation . The crawling peg would also avoid sharp devaluations and revaluations . It would thus discourage currency speculation because the gains that could be achieved from parity changes would be too small to bother about .
