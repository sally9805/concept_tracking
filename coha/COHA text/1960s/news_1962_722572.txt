txt Letters to The Times pg . 30 Letters to The Times State Democratic Record Lanigan Proposes Reforms Leading to an Effective Party To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Michael Prendergast , former Democratic State Chairman , has taken issue with my statement made July 23 before the Committee to Study Revision of the Rules of the Demo- , crate State Committee , My difference with Mr , Prendergast is one of basic political concept as to the proper function of the Democratic State Committee of New York and the nature of the New York State Democratic party itself . I am , therefore , taking ads opportunity to paraphrase my statement before the rules committee . We have never had a New York State Democratic party . We do not have one now . This is why New York State has a Republican Governor and two Republican Senators . We have had a New York City Democratic party . We have had traditionally several local islands upstate , as in Buffalo and Albany ? with Nassau , Monroe and Broome Counties now emerging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic strength in New York State , have no political agency speaking for them or organizing for them . Except for their own efforts within their county organizations , they have no place within the party 's over-all organization . City-Bound Activities The traditional leaders of the New York City Democratic party have not in the past needed a state-wide Democratic party . They have really never given priority to electing a Governor or United States Senators because their power lay in City Hall and in the patronage from the city courts . Their political horizons did not extend beyond the city . Because of their lack of interest , the Democratic State Committee has been deliberately kept impotent and maintained largely as a paper organization . The state chairman has been kept from taking any part in party affairs within New York City . He has traditionally been a patronage dispenser for upstate counties during those infrequent periods when we have had a Democratic Governor . The organization of the Democratic State Committee reflects the nineteenth-century philosophy of the nineteenth-century city machine . The State Committee has never made an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never prepared a comprehensive program for the Legislature ; it has never attempted a consistent plan to carry both houses of the Legislature ( yet a Democratic Governor with a Republican majority can only be a figurehead ? he can not govern the state ) . Building Candidates In my statement before the rules committee , I proposed : The establishment of a full-time research division responsible for preparing a complete legislative program ; an organizational division to find and build candidates for both the State Legislature and Congress and to help strengthen every county organization ; an annual conference conducted by the State Committee to formulate legislative programs ; and an annual budget submitted by the state chairman to the State Committee to cover these programs . Fortunately , the new state chairman , William , is aware of much of the foregoing and wants to overhaul the party structure . Unless we proceed now before this , campaign to reorganize the Democratic State Committee , making it the true policy-making body for the party for the entire state , and giving it meaningful organizational responsibility on a state-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election and we will never have an effective New York State Democratic party , JAMES S.

Parking Near Hydrants To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The current frenzy of fire-hydrant ticketing is another example of archaic New York ordinances . The issuance of a ticket to a motorist 14 feet 11 inches from the hydrant points up the absurdity of the 15-foot law , enacted , no doubt , when it was necessary to back a horse - drawn vehicle next to the hydrant . For many years now fire pumpers have been equipped with six- to eight-foot lengths of semi-flexible adapter hose , which are used to connect the pumper to the hydrant . Not only is it not desirable , but it is not possible , to park a fire truck next to the curb and connect it to the hydrant . In effect , the fire engine must " double park " and three to four , feet between parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firemen . That the present law is being violated is undesirable . However , once again the motorist is being needlessly harassed , this time under the mistaken notion that he is endangering lives in case of fire . A change in the 15-foot law would not only ease diplomatic tensions , but would add more parking spaces , at no cost , than all the municipal parking garages being proposed . SOLOMON 0 . SCHARF ' . Seaford , N. Y. , Aug. 3 , 1962 . Training Maritime Officers Cost of Graduating a Cadet Is Estimated at $20,000 TO THE Enrros OF THE NEW YORK Trmzs : It does not cost $60,000 to graduate a cadet either from the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point or from any of the four State Maritime Colleges . William Lambert , in his letter published Aug. 7 , uses incorrect arithmetic . Assuming that Kings Point receives $3 million a year of Federal funds for current operating expenses , this money is spent on all four classes ( including the partial education of the drop-outs ) and not solely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual budget were $3 million and 200 cadets graduated annually , the cost per graduate would be $15,000 for his four years at the school . Mr. Lambert improperly multiplies this figure by four and is shocked at the result .. Actually , Mr. Lambert 's figures are too incomplete to approximate the cost of educating a maritime officer . His $3 million does not include the capitalized cost of the training ship loaned gratis by the Federal Government , nor the amortization of the college plant , nor the occasional extra appropriations for equipment . Possibly $20,000 ( or $5,000 per year for each of the four years spent at the school ) would be a fair estimate of the cost per graduate at a maritime college . I doubt whether the costs at the State Maritime Colleges are appreciably lower than at Kings Point . Despite the luxuriousness of Kings Point equipment  --  and it is good to find an occasional college with adequately equipped laboratories  --  the cost is spread over a much larger number of students than at the state maritime academies . The overhead and administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point 's friendly competitor just across the Sound ) must be absorbed by a student body only half the size of Kings Point , so that the cost per student might be almost equal . Especially might this be true by the time the new building program now under way at our State University Maritime College is completed . FREDERIC C. GENZMER . Staten Island , N. Y. , Aug. 7 , 1962 . East-West Arming Assailed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Is it possible that your editorial of Aug. 6 " Moscow 's Great Blast " was intended ironically ? The con. trast you drew there between one earnest efforts to end the growing danger of radioactive fall-out and Soviet Russia 's cynical pursuit of " increased might regardless of the consequences for humanity " had the effect , on me at least , of suggesting how little we deserve your praise . The new American proposals at Geneva , for instance , which you cite as evidence for our sincerity , were approved by a Joint Congressional Com-'ittee , according to your- own dispatches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accepted . Your editorial , in juxtaposing the proposals and the " blast , " conveniently overlooked what will not escape objective observers throughout the world  --  that the anticipated renewal of testing by Russia could well have determined the timing of our latest move at Geneva . What your editorial effectively though perhaps unintentionally , underlined was the cynicism on both sides . We , as well as the Russians , are pursuing increased might . The Russians , as well as we , are making proposals for disarmament . The words are all for peace . The actions are preparation for war . " Jntil we put the kind of effort and potential sacrifice into developing the institutional framework for peace that we now devote to creating the instruments of war , we , Russians and Americans alike , would do well not to raise the issue of sincerity . We must indeed , as you say , continue to seek a way to end these tests . But claims to virtue and imputations of " malevolence " impede rather than help the quest .. CHAS .
