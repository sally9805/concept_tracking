Let us now praise television . Its longbows , drawn since springtime , finally twanged last week and 17 arrows flew . Wunk . Tunk . Boink . Doyng . One after another , TV 's new series all hit on or near the mark . <P> <P> The single word that best distinguishes this year 's series is honest . Unlike many plays of Broadway and films of Hollywood , they are free of **26;4336;TOOLONG , undisturbing and unoffending . They are accomplishments of theatrical engineering , designed to say and mean nothing while being diverting , with a net moral value of point zero zero . All were offered by NBC and ABC-CBS has temporarily held its fire . <P> <P> The most interesting trend visible so far is an emphasis on sex . The TV men have also forsaken their experiments with ever longer shows . In fact , most of the new series are 1954-style , hardtop , 30-minute comic potboilers . <P> Plot and situation , however well-turned or bizarre , have much less effect on the lifespan of a TV series than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked by the watching families , they are wanted back in the living room next week-and that is what keeps the Nielsen ratings high and the sponsors contented . Most of the new shows are adequately deep in personable people . <P> <P> ABC <P> Valentine 's Day , for example , is a house of cards about a young bachelor publisher who likes a white fuzzy drink called Cotton Gin and keeps a portable fireplug in his Jaguar XKE to help create parking spaces . Last week he was publishing a book called The Fraudulent Female , which claimed that women criminally exaggerate the burden of housework . To prove its thesis to a potentially dangerous female critic , he went off with her for a weekend on Staten Island , where he did all the chores for a family of five . Impossible as it may seem , the show was amusing , but only because Tony Franciosa , as the publisher , delivered a winning personality far in excess of the requirements of the script , and Jack Soo , who looks like Robert Mitchum , was irresistible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ponies . <P> The Addams Family are successful incarnations of the necrogeists in Charles Addams ' cartoons . Their house is a great Victorian cobweb with a bear rug that growls when stepped on , a stuffed sailfish that has the legs of a child protruding from its mouth , and a mailbox with a hand in it that receives letters . Including guillotined dolls and thoroughbred spiders that are raised by the children , the props are obviously first-rate , but the people are even better . Beautiful Carolyn Jones plays the mother , Morticia , with a chilling verve that should make any dead-blooded man want to share a bier with her . Her husband Gomez ( John Astin ) and Uncle Fester ( Jackie Coogan ) are quite sufficiently insane , but one could research the annals of television and not discover the likes of her butler Lurch , who is played by Ted Cassidy , 6 ft. 9 in. , 250 Ibs. , with a massive , embalmed face and a deft touch on the parlor spinet.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
