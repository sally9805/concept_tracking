 | Spoiled Child Mornings at our house are always frantic , but the day of the school concert was worse than usual . Since Laurie was starring in the second-grade play , her older sister was in a thoroughly unpleasant mood . " Mother , you 've overcooked this egg ! " Martha shoved it aside , grimacing . " I ca n't eat it . It 's rubbery . " I put down the Thermos bottle . " I 'm sorry , dear . I 'll make you another . Here , Laurie , you take Martha 's egg . " I cut short her wail of protest . " Come on now , finish up . This is n't a French restaurant . " " Mummy . . . " Laurie 's whisper was timid . " Mummy , you wo n't forget about my net overskirt ?

You do n't care what happens to me . " I sighed . What was the use of arguing ? It was heads-I-lose , tailsyou-win every time . " All right , take the bike , " I continued on page 47  | What Every Woman Should Know About The Beatles Being neither a teenager nor a female , I am not infected with Beatlemania . I keep my hair cut short the way I always have and I can not bear to listen to Beatle music . And yet I have just made a 1,400-mile trip to the British island of Nassau -- a journey I undertook for the sole purpose of observing the Beatles at first hand and watching their curious effect on their fans -- as well as on other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sane adult would undertake such a mission , I 'd like to explain . Not long ago my wife and I went to see the Beatles movie , A Hard Day 's Night , and to our surprise thoroughly enjoyed it . We found ourselves wholeheartedly agreeing with the critics who 'd compared it to the best of the Marx Brothers . The Beatles themselves struck us as clever , competent and even agreeable young men . Afterward , my wife and I asked @# each other what the commotion called Beatlemania is all about . I told her that if I got a chance I 'd like to find out for myself what the Beatles are really like and why their public appearances invariably produce mass hysteria . I got my chance . When the four Liverpool singers were signed by a Hollywood company for a second film , HELP ! , to be made in Nassau , I was invited to cover their arrival . Since there could be no better laboratory for observation and evaluation than a quiet and isolated island , I decided to make the trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens ; it is made . I do not know how it worked in the early days in England when the Beatles first hooked up with their very astute business manager , but at this point it is the result not so much of deliberate staging as of ineptitude . It is a product of what psychiatry calls " the self-fulfilling prophecy . " The theory : If you treat a child as though he is a delinquent , the chances are he will become one ; if one or both partners in a marriage behave as if it is doomed , then it is likely to fail . In other words , if you anticipate the worst , it may well happen . And one good way to incite a Beatle riot is to expect one and create an antiriot climate . When I arrived in Nassau a few days ahead of the Beatles , a fullfledged riot was in the making . The fuse had been lit six months earlier when a suave " mystery man " appeared on the island and began inquiring after large parcels of real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search attracted local attention . So did the arrival , later on , of other Beatle agents . When , some months later , one of the group , George Harrison , stopped off in person to inspect what had been , done , the stage was set . One week before B-Day , the Beatles ' representatives called a briefing meeting with Nassau officialdom . It was announced that the Beatles would be arriving from London the following Monday on a chartered jet along with continued on page 14  | some 70 associates and that upon landing , to avert disaster , they would have to be spirited away to a press conference . Not a single Bahamian in the room truly expected an assault on the Beatles , but all had read about mob scenes elsewhere and nobody felt he could risk complacency . Therefore , all took part in hatching a plan for protective deception and no one pointed out that the most intricate defenses often prove the most inflammatory . The following Monday , at Nassau International Airport , I was on hand to see the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to await the arrival . Those on hand were an orderly gathering ? mostly girls eight to sixteen , with a sprinkling of kid brothers and a sharp-eyed contingent of mothers . Two teenage boys with Beatle haircuts sulked almost unnoticed . The tensest moment of the vigil occurred when a girl 's voice exclaimed : " Diana ! What are you doing here ? You do n't even like the Beatles . " Diana tried to pretend she was someone else . A dozen policemen were scattered about the airport grounds with reinforcements standing by on the outskirts and in the city . But there was little to fear from the well-contained fans . They had come to look ; not necessarily to touch . And anyway the mothers had them well under control ? at least until the Great Deception began to unfold . But no mother can endure seeing her child thwarted or , worse still , cheated . The self-fulfilling prophecy moved into high gear soon after the Beatles ' jet touched down on a distant runway and was brought to a stop . The plane lingered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limousine rolled up to its far side . Under cover of darkness , Customs and Immigration officials boarded ; the Beatles disembarked and drove away in the limousine . Concealed from the fans ' view by both darkness and the plane , the car drove toward an abandoned road leading away from the airport . Meanwhile , the plane taxied properly to the unloading gate . The crowd cheered . Four young men with mop hair descended . There were cheers , and banners reading " WE LOVE YOU BEATLES " were unfurled . So were posters bearing Beatle photos . Everybody pressed toward the rail for a closer look ? at four unknown young men in Beatle wigs ! There was a moan , which turned to fury when someone spotted the limousine 's headlights leaving the far end of the field . The crowd dashed for the parking lots and gave chase . A few boys had motorcycles . The rest of the posse were carloads of screaming children driven recklessly by irate mothers . Cars veered from one side of the road to the other . Motorcycles cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rounded a two-lane curve . It was a terrifying journey , headlined next day : " BEATLES LEAD TERROR DRIVE . " Miraculously , nobody was hurt . The Beatles reached their scheduled press conference at a convention hall seconds ahead of the crowd . They scurried through the front entrance , which was then sealed off by a wall of policemen , and took their places at a table draped in billiard-green cloth . All four looked grotesque , fatigued , and a trifle bored . Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney sipped Scotch , George Harrison a CocaCola , and John Lennon some water . A radio man poked a microphone in front of George and said : " Heh , heh , John . Written any good books lately ? " Meanwhile , John , who actually did write a book , was asked : " How continued on page 16 14  | many songs have you written , Paul ? " A lady accosted Paul with : " Young man , which one are you ? " He replied : " Me ? I 'm Roger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were present for the conference . I wondered how many of them were actually reporters . Outside , the helter-skelter chase had jelled into a howling mob . I sat down , waiting for the chitchat to end and the conference to begin . A girl in the next seat greeted me in a friendly New Yorkish accent , and I asked her what part of the press she represented . " NBC , kind of , " she said , giggling . Then she whispered , " Do n't tell a soul ! I just worked for NBC for a few hours ? on election night . But they gave me a press card and I kept it . It got me in here tonight . " She produced a card signed by David Brinkley and began to kiss it . Her name was Cathy Dahut of Roslyn , Long Island . She was sixteen . We waited to ask our questions . Finally , someone said , " All right , lads , time to go . " The Beatles stood up in unison and marched out a back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out front as a decoy . At the front entrance to the convention hall a chief inspector of police assured the mob : " They 'll be out in just a minute . " ... " They 'll be coming this way . " . . . " They have to get their car , y'know . " When the Beatles had five minutes ' getaway time , the inspector opened the doors . " They 're gone ! " he proclaimed exultantly . Trying to salvage what it could , the crowd raced for the table where the Beatles had sat . Cathy Dahut was holding Paul 's tumbler . Two girls and a little boy seized the other three and Cathy told them whose was whose . Others grappled for napkins , ashtrays , even ashes . I stood back and watched , along with an eleven-year-old boy who said to nobody in particular : " I 'll never believe a policeman again . " The next evening , I was granted an hour 's audience with the Beatles at their secret headquarters . " Make yourself to home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He , at 24 , is the group 's Elder Statesman . He seemed to be trying to live up to his new role of married man , but was n't entirely at home with it . Mostly , I suspect , he was missing his eighteen-year-old bride , Maureen . " Why did n't you bring her along ? " I asked Ringo . " When we work , " he replied , " there 's not much fun . " " I never bring my wife on our trips , " said John . " She takes the worst shoving from police because she looks like she wants to marry me or something . " John spoke with a kind of surly finality . Mostly , he just heckled the others . Nothing he said was especially witty or important , but he spoke every line as though it were the perfect squelch . " Besides , " said Paul , sprawled across an armchair , " Ringo 's wife has gangrene . " Paul , " the cute Beatle , " is the suave playboy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorous . I asked about Beatlemania and George remarked : " You 're a bit behind the times , are n't you ? A year or two ago , it was Beatlemania . Now it 's just fan worship . " What did fan worship tell the Beatles about their fans ? Paul spoke first : " That they 're nice . " John struck a pious pose and said : " That they need someone to love . " Paul said : " Beatlemania is n't difficult to define . It 's Rudolph Valentino mania , only younger . " With that , Ringo leaped from his chair and sailed across the room . John grumbled : " He said Valentino , not Nureyev . " Upon landing , Ringo said : " The only thing fan worship tells me is my bank balance . As long as it goes on , I do n't have to look at my bank book . " " What if it ever stopped ? " I asked . " Would you miss it ? " Ringo replied : " Not really . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll have some notice . It 'll never stop in just one day . " " I would n't be sick if it did , " John asserted . " I can adapt to anything . " Having written In His Own Write , perhaps John could make a living as an author ? " I doubt it , " said John . " Authors do n't make very good livings . " ( Beatles do . Their continued on page 20 @#  | 1964 income has been estimated at between ten and fifty million dollars . ) Were they impressed by the mob scene the night before ? " We never saw it , " said Ringo . " It always happens behind us . " I tried to describe for them what had happened and why . Then I asked : " Aside from the way you 're handled , is there anything about you that brings out the beast in people ? " " Frustration , I guess , " said George . " Until we come , they never think they 'll meet a Beatle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they think they have a chance . The way things are , though , they do n't . In the back of their minds , they never mean to go wild . But when their wish almost comes true , they stop thinking ? and then it always happens . " The Beatles had mixed feelings about the policemen around the world . Paul told me : " Sometimes , we 're alive because of them ; sometimes , in spite of them . A few times in your country ? down South especially ? they 'd lead us right into a jam . They imagine they know best ? which they do n't ? about our fans . To those police , we 're just another football game to handle . " Ringo spoke up for law and order : " Ninety percent of the time , the police do a good job . In Liverpool , when we were unknown , nobody I knew liked ' em . We figured Watch out for the police . ' But now we have a lot to thank ' em for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dead by now if it were n't for good coppers . " The phone rang . John answered it in a rasping gangster voice : " Yeah , which boy d' ya want ? . . . Nah , Ringo ai n't here . . . . Nah , Paul and George ai n't here , neither . . . John ? John who ? Maw , this is the maid . " He hung up . Then he turned to me : " It was for you , " he said . I asked John for a Beatle's-eyeview of the world and all the exotic places they 'd been . He replied defensively : " I see the world just the same as somebody else sees it . " George said hopefully : " An island like this is small enough that maybe we 'll see it if everything is n't like last night . Most big cities ? whether we 're in America , Australia , New Zealand , even Hong Kong ? all look the same : airport , hotel , wherever @# @# we 're working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by myself , I liked what I saw . If we can sit under a palm tree , get some sunshine and swimming while we 're here , I 'll be happy . " We talked about the press and Ringo said : " Without them and TV , nobody would know about us . So we 're grateful . " He punctuated his gratitude with a mournful " Yeah . " Paul said : " Whenever I read about us in the press , I believe everything about the other three , even when I know it is n't so . Sometimes I even believe what I read about me ? until I realize who I 'm reading about . I mean , up to then it 's about some star I 'll never meet and his name seems familiar and ? wow ? it 's mine ! " I mentioned a fan magazine 's spurious attempt to link Ringo romantically with Hayley Mills . Ringo blushed . John complained : " The magazines in Britain would be fined and outlawed if they did the things these American fan magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared at a benefit for handicapped children , that one of us has a retarded brother . " With this , Paul struck a cretinlike pose , but picked up where he 'd left off : " I should know better than to read those magazines because there 's nothing new to be written about us . I mean , you have n't asked us a single question that we have n't been asked before . " In his early twenties , here was the man who 'd been asked everything ? even " When will World War III start ? " and " Is there more homosexuality in England than elsewhere ? " All I could say was : " Can you think of any question you 've never been asked by the press ? " Paul shook his head and Ringo said sadly : " Not even that one . " " And do n't ask us Would you like to ask me a question ? ' " George warned me , " because , if you do , I 'll smash you . " " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to know . " I tell them I 'm married , " said Ringo ; then in a stagey aside , Ringo added , " Says continued on page 22 21  | he , lifting John 's line . " It occurred to me then that I was not conversing with the Beatles so much as eavesdropping . Theirs were the kind of inbred exchanges you hear among sailors sealed off in antarctic outposts or among college students holed up in dormitories at exam time . They had been talking to each other ? and hardly anyone else ? for so long that they now spoke their own language . In such an atmosphere , the visitor is made to feel strange yet welcome ? an emissary from the mysterious outside world . Because of the language barrier , however , the talk has a way of dead-ending . For example , all four Beatles were thirsty to hear about everyday life in America , a land where someone in Boston can talk , free of charge , with a telephone operator in San Diego merely by dialing 7145551212 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operator , if you feel like it ? " George asked me . " Depends on the operator , I guess , " Paul put in . " In England , " said Ringo , " you dial INF . " " Yes , " said Paul , " we have n't gone to digits . " " No , " said John , " just midgets . " And that was the end of that . When we parted and they all instructed me to give their regards to Broadway , Paul added : " They 're rolling , those Americans ! " Almost on cue , Ringo asked " Why ? " and Paul explained in a Mister Magoo voice : " Higher standard of living . Hiya , standard of living ! " Leaving their hideaway , I scarcely envied these four good-natured , rather touching millionaires cooped up in their prison of super-success . They had proved to be neither the long-haired wits that some adult intellectuals take them for nor the " guttersnipes " that a Nassau hostess later labeled them when they serenaded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat old bag . " Despite their antisocial behavior , they ? like their fans ? impressed me as more abused than abusive . When they were ready to leave Nassau , the Beatles tried to make amends to their fans by going out to the airport an hour before departure time . Unfortunately , school was then in session and hardly anybody was willing to play hooky to risk another run-around.
