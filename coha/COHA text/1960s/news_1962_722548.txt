txt The Democratic leader of Manhattan opened a cam . paign yesterday to draft Justice Bernard Botein to run for Governor . Edward N. Costikyan , the New York Counts leader , said Justice Botein , who is Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court , First Department , could unite . the Democratic party . Mr. Costikyan said the justice had the temperament , courage ind experience to " make an ideal Governor . " " I believe he should be drafted , " Mr. Costikyan said in a letter to William H. , the Democratic state chairman . The Manhattan leader said that he was expressing only his personal yew . But it seemed unlikely that he would have acted without the consent of the county executive committee and at least the knowledge of Mayor Wagner . Mr. Costikyan is known to have consulted other political leaders before making his letter public , presumably in the hope of starting a bandwagon for Justice Botein . But the first reaction from counties outside the city was lukewarm at best . Adviser to Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and relies upon him heavily for advice on judicial matters . The Mayor also has mentioned him frequently in his list of possible candidates for Governor . Justice Botein could not be reached immediately for comment . At his summer home in Chappaqua , N. Y. , a member of his family said he was " on a fishing trip . " Although his term on the bench runs through 1970 , there have been indications since last year that he would be willing , under some circumstances , to resign from his $39,000-a-year post to run for another office . One such circumstance would be a draft , since political tradition forbids a sitting judge to campaign actively for nomination or election to another post . Justice Botein probably would be unwilling to resign un- less he were sure of at least the nomination . Another such circumstance is reported to . be an assurance of adequate financing for a campaign to unseat Governor Rockefeller next fall . Justice Botein is reported to have told friends he would not consider . running without a $500,000 . campaign chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a state convention in Syracuse Sept. 17 and 18 . With the support of the Manhattan delegation , Justice Botein would be assured of 118 of the 1,138 votes . Mr. Wagner , who was in West Berlin yesterday on a vacation tour , did not accept a telephone call placed to inquire about his present view of Justice Botein as a candidate . The Mayor , who is the acknowledged leader of the party in the state , could easily add the 185 votes of Kings County and the 119 of Queens County , where he directly commands the party organizations , for a total of 422 . But political observers thought that Mr. Wagner , if he favored Justice Botein , would not show his hand immediately for fear of giving the impression that he was dictating the choice of a candidate . It was believed more likely that the strategy of a draft would be to await support from some of the populous counties outside New York City . The principle ones would be Nassau , Westchester , Erie , Monroe , Onondaga and Albany . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not believe the draftBotein movement was " going to go anywhere . " Mr. English said he was sure that Westchester and the large counties upstate were not interested in Justice Botein . Councilman Seymour Boyers , one of the two-man ' Queens County leadership , said Justice Botein would be " an excellent candidate . " But Mr. Boyers remained non-committal . " I do n't think you 'll see any sign of a bandwagon before several weeks go by " and Mr. Botein makes clear that he is willing to run , Mr. Boyers said . He added that Queens Democrats would not decide on a candidate for some time . Mr. Boyers also speculated that Mr. Costikyan might be putting Justice Botein forth as a " favorite son , " to be in a position to bargain with other county leaders supporting " favorite sons " of their own . In his letter , Mr. Costikyan recalled that the state chairman had urged all sixty-two Democratic county chairmen to take soundings on possible candidates for Governor . He said he had found " substantial support " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stratton of Schenectady , District Attorney Frank D. O'Connor of Queens and Howard J. Samuels , a Canandiagua industrialist . But Mr. Costikyan said he The New York Times DRAFT CHOICE : Justice Bernard Botein of the Appellate Division , who has been urged for Governor by Manhattan Democratic chief . could detect no majority sentiment in favor of anyone , and believed Mr. Rockefeller could be defeated only " if we crystallize our forces behind a Democrate who can unify our entire party . " Noting that Gov . Richard J. Hughes of New Jersey had resigned from the bench last year to wage a successful Democratic campaign for Governor , Mr. Costikyan said that " we in New York might well profit by the lesson . " He praised Justice Botein as one of the principal architects of the reorganization of the courts in New York and a man with " rich administrative service " before he put on judicial robes . Mr. replied in a statement that he welcomed Mr. Costikyan 's suggestion but that as state chairman he was bound to be " as fair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or otherwise .
