When the 15-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed 18 years ago , there was no question about its need or its purpose . That was to stop an expanding Communist empire from taking over Western Europe . As NATO inaugurated its new $8,000,000 headquarters in Brussels last week , the situation was entirely different . " Today , " said Belgian Diplomat Jean-Paul van Bellinghen , " our only enemies are among us-those who are not ready to sacrifice a part of their independence to cooperate in a common work . " <P> No one had to be told that Van Bellinghen was referring to France 's Charles de Gaulle . When De Gaulle served NATO headquarters with an eviction notice 19 months ago and withdrew from the military side of the alliance , NATO defenses were visibly weakened-if only by the loss of France 's 72,000-man contingent , based in Germany . Yet NATO still remains strong enough to meet any challenge . To counteract the 1,300,000 Soviet-bloc troops deployed through Eastern Europe . NATO maintains an army of 2,500,000 men , organized into ground and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the northern tip of Norway down through Britain and Italy and over to Greece and Turkey . <P> In the end , France 's eviction notice even had a salutary effect . It gave NATO an excuse to reorganize and consolidate its sprawling headquarters operation under a single roof . With its 1,320 offices and 15 conference rooms , the new headquarters building in Brussels provides enough space for both the 15-man NATO Council-the political arm of the alliance , to which De Gaulle still belongs-and the 390-man Military Committee , which handles defense and used to be based in Washington . Another Paris problem was solved with the construction of a lavish new communications center that permits continuous contact with NATO capitals and major NATO commands . <P> A Fragile Flirtation . As NATO heads towards its 20th anniversary , its biggest danger , ironically , comes from the current European dtente . The new state of East-West relations , says U.S. NATO Ambassador Harlan Cleveland , is still a " fragile flirtation , with the West pitching most of the woo . " But NATO nations are acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be renewed . They are losing , says Belgium 's Paul-Henri Spaak , NATO 's Secretary-General from 1957-1961 , " the cement of fear that bound them together . " They tend to squabble over everything from their respective troop commitments to control of U.S. nuclear weapons . <P> The value of the military alliance tends to get lost in argument , and in an effort to achieve the harmony it needs , the NATO Council voted last December to authorize a study of the impact of world politics on NATO since 1949 . The need for the study is all too obvious . In the current climate of bickering , many European nations that can not agree among themselves still have trouble accepting continued American domination of NATO . The talk runs more and more to a fifty-fifty U.S.European partnership . Such an arrangement would be eminently satisfactory says Spaak . " But it is difficult to bring off The trouble is , a political Europe does not exist , and this is not the fault of the Americans , but of the Europeans . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
