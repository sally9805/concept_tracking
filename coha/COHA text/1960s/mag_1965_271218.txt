In the nether world of the narcotics addict , a man 's only loyalty is to himself . Richard Robles , a sallow-faced , 22-year-old junkie , learned that lesson too late last week when a Manhattan jury found him guilty of the sadistic murders of Career Girls Janice Wylie and Emily Hoffert in August 1963 . The most convincing evidence against Robles was provided by his two best friends , fellow addicts both . <P> One was Nathan Delaney , 36 , a Negro twice convicted on felony charges ; the other was Delaney 's white wife Marjorie , 30 , a prostitute . A major part of the state 's case rested on the Delaneys , who by any standard were hardly credible witnesses . When he himself faced a homicide rap in the killing of a dope peddler last year , Delaney offered to lead police to Robles in return for leniency in his own case . After a grand jury refused to indict Delaney on the murder charge , he and his wife set about getting Robles to talk about the double slaying-within range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those conversations , the state 's case included a detective 's testimony that after Robles was arrested , he said : " I went in to pull a lousy burglary and I wind up killing two girls . " Needing money for a heroin fix , Robles said he entered the girls ' East Side Manhattan apartment through an open window , picked up two kitchen knives and started prowling around . Finding blonde Janice Wylie , 21 , asleep in the nude , he sexually attacked her . When Roommate Emily Hoffert , 23 , walked in , Robles said , he grabbed her , bound the two women together and tied them to a bed . Robles was quoted as saying : " Something told me I had to kill them . I got two soda bottles and struck them over the head . I knocked out Janice and I only stunned Emily . I just kept stabbing them . " Afterward , testified the Delaneys , Robles showed up at their apartment wearing bloodstained clothes and explained : " I need a shot .

Defense Attorney Jack Hoffinger read to the jury a confession that police said had been made by Whitmore . On the witness stand , Whitmore denied having made a confession . <P> It took the jury of five women and seven men five hours to find Robles guilty on two counts of felony murder . Because New York abolished the death penalty last June ( except for killing either a policeman or a prison employee during an escape attempt ) , Robles faces a maximum of two consecutive life sentences .
