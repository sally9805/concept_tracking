My FIRST recollection of B.B. dates from nearly fifty years ago , when he was in his early forties and I a child of eight . As I drove with my mother up to the little Tuscan wood of aromatic cypress and pine which was that day 's meeting place , he was waiting , with thinly veiled impatience , beneath a tree ; a slight , trim figure in a pale-gray suit , with a pointed beard and a red carnation in his buttonhole . " Come quick , " he said . " I want you to see the view before the light fades . " As we climbed over the slippery pine needles ? our guide as sure-footed as any of the little black goats we encountered ? I thought that I had never seen any grown-up man skip up a hill so lightly , but when , having reached the ledge , we looked down over the valley of the Sieve , I also thought that I seldom had seen anyone stand so still . Later on I realized that he had been just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keen as if he were still the young art student who had come to Italy more than twenty years before , but with an eye enriched and sharpened by every undertone of knowledge and comparison which the intervening years had brought . " Look , " he said , pointing to a happily placed farmhouse on a low knoll , with its dovecot and group of cypresses , " look , a Corot . " Of all the facets of that complex personality , this is the one that I remember best ? the way in which he would look at what lay before him . One day in my childhood , when he had taken me to sec some frescoes , he told me ' the Indian tale of how the God of Bow and Arrow taught his little boy how to hit a mark . " He took him into a wood and asked him what lie saw . The boy said , ' I see a tree . ' Look again . ' I sec a bird . ' Look again . ' I see its head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Then shoot ! ' " It was the same , B.B. said , in , looking . " One moment is enough , if the concentration is absolute . " This concentration was not confined to works of art ; it was extended to any and every form of beauty . In some moods he would say , " The study of art is only a preparation for the enjoyment of landscape . " But , indeed , for him the two pleasures were so closely interwoven , so enriched by constant cross references to each other , that it would have been difficult to say which was the starting point . " You do n't know , " he wrote in 1890 to his future wife , after his first visit to Murano , " all that sun and sky and water and light mean to me . " And she herself has described how , on their first visit to Verona together , they would spend the whole morning in churches and picture galleries but set out every afternoon into the hills to see how the landscape illuminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stab us with the poignant realization , ' This is Italy ! ' " B.B. 's letters and his travel diaries are constantly enriched by his comparisons between other scenes and other works of art , spontaneously welling up to complete a new experience . When he first saw Monte Oliveto , the ash-gray hills and steep , hare canyons at once reminded him of Dore 's wildernesses ; many years later , the ruins of . Ostia Antica appeared to him as " living Hubert Roberts " ; the landscape between Barca and Cyrene brought hack " the grey-green Claude Lorrains that we admire so much . " In the oasis of Tagiura in Tripolitania , he was constantly aware , for all the immediate exoticism of the palm trees and mud huts , of the closeness of the ancient world , not only in the Roman columns of the mosque , " like those in the Cathedral of Cordova or the Great Mosque of Kairouan , " but even in the garments of the Arabs . " Often I have wondered , " he wrote , " how a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , new or in rags , and stride on utterly unaware of how Antique they look to us . " A group of old men waitint , on a bench for the hour of prayer recalled the waiting of Giovanni Bellini 's Transfiguration , and when , in the Museum of Tripoli , he was shown a small , exquisite ivory , possibly Alexandrian , of a man crouching in a ritual posture , he was at once reminded of Queequeg , in Moby Dick , crouching in ecstatic prayer before a wooden idol . It was this richness of mind , as revealed in such wholly personal and often unexpected associations and images , layer upon layer , like the fine pastry called mille-feuilles , that made him so enchanting a companion in travel or even on an afternoon 's country drive , to which he would impart as great a sense of adventure as to a distant journey . " I could follow up any road , any bypath , " he wrote , " with the same zest that I would read a story , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet got over the small boy 's dream of a journey coming to an end . " And to this his wife has added that there were occasions , at the end of a long day 's drive , when he would become " actually deceitful , pretending that something he wanted to see was only ' just round the corner ' . . . which proved to be 35 or 40 miles away . " This passion for travel for its own sake , entirely irrespective of its value to his work , was closely allied to what he called his " intemperate lust for reading . " " I can get absorbed , " he wrote , " in any historical work regarding any people , any period , any movement in religion or in thought , any anthropological or ethnological publication , the more detailed the better . I can read any book of travel . . . . Something within my range of interest that I have not yet known makes inc happy with an almost voluptuous happiness . " ( His friends will remember the gusto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Quests mancava alla mia cultura ! " ) All this knowledge came to form , thanks to his phenomenal memory , the rich and varied tapestry against which his journeys were unrolled . During a brief journey to Calabria at the age of almost ninety , he wrote that he had not needed to read any books about the region before starting , since his mind was already stocked with impressions from the history and travel books read many years before . He traveled with Lear and Lenormant , with Gissing and Norman Douglas . His present journey was enriched by images of the past ; his knowledge of the past quickened by the scene before his eyes . As curious , persistent , and imaginative as a child , as agile as a chamois , as sensitive as a poet , as learned as a sage ? that was B.B. upon his travels . The taste dated from early childhood . " I recall , " he wrote during a journey to Sicily in his old age , " how as a boy of six or seven at most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the horizon . Moving , going towards another town , another village even , used to make me feverish with excitement . And now that I am almost eighty-eight , why am I here , suffering fatigue , discomfort and even boredom , if not from the animal urge ' to go on pilgrimage ' ? " It was in 1888 , when Bcrcnson was twenty-three , that the journey began . The young , brilliant Jewish art student from Harvard , with little in his pocket but with an indefatigable industry and insatiable curiosity , came back to the Europe which he had left at the age of ten and first of all , in the full tide of the classical enthusiasm acquired at Harvard , made his way to Greece . For his whole life the recollection of those days at Olympia remained bathed in a golden light ; he looked back on it as the place where he had first been " utterly cut off from the world , perfectly at one with my natural surroundings . " The next year brought him to Sicily and Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sense , roads leading to Rome . He spent several months at Oxford , Berlin , and the Sorbonne and the spring and summer of 1890 in England , meeting his future wife , then Mary Costelloe , and , in her own words , acting " like a catalyst precipitating the various elements held in solution in our family group . . . . Fascinated we listened to his talk about Proven ? al poetry , the Greek anthology , Russian novels and Wagner 's operas . Even my dear Quaker mother who told her daughter that she had always asso- elated the word pleasure only with nice listened to his strange doctrines in admiring silence , and we all ordered large photographs of the pictures of Giorgione and Botticelli . " The following winter was spent in the galleries of Berlin , Dresden , and Vienna , but it was always Italian pictures that the young man turned to and thoughts of Italy that filled his mind . From Berlin he was writing to Mary : " A day in Italy is worth more than a week elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to tell others what it is , you must go where it grows . The structure one can perhaps study in a herbarium . " And he went on to wonder whether it was not this lack of a return to the fountainhead that sometimes produced " the mere scholasticism of directors of galleries . . . They chew their cud over and over and eat no fresh grass . " The Italy to which he was drawn was one which none of us has ever known . " I knew a Rome , " he wrote at eighty-two , " where the country not only embraced the town , but invaded it almost to Piazza di Spagna . From the terrace before San Giovanni in Laterano , the fields stretched out uncontaminated , with only an ancient wine-shop Isere and there , to the Sleeping Beauty of the Alban Hills . " In Sicily in 1889 there was only a single hotel at Taormina , a small pink house below the Roman Theater ; and at Girgenti , where he had walked down to the temples to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two carabinieri on horseback who had galloped down to tell him to return at once , for his own safety , within the city walls . In 1893 he was preparing his work on Lorenzo Lotto by pursuing Lotto 's paintings throughout the smallest and least-known churches of Bergamo and the surroundings , as well as in remote villages of the Marches . Sixty years later , on visiting the Lotto exhibition in Venice in 1953 , he recalled with delight the hardships and excitements of that journey , comparing them with those of a medieval pilgrim . Avoiding the crowded horse buses , he traveled mostly on foot or by hiring a light bagher ( buggy ) . The inns were scarce and dirty , his food often little more than stale.bread and onions with a handful of anchovies , but every morning he woke to " a glamorous adventure , " and when at last he found himself before the altarpiece Ise was seeking , " in the place for which it was made , " he felt as great a joy as . if , like those earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture remained fixed in memory as a crystalline individuality , and not as a mere particle in the oeuvre of a painter . Its overtones lingered in the recollection and its taste on the palate . " By then , the needle of his compass was already set . The three great books which first made hisname , The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance , The Florentine Painters of the Renaissance , and The Central Italian Painters of the Renaissance , all appeared between 1894 and 1897 , before he was 32 . The profession of expertise and the partnership with Duveen came some years later , and later still , from the resulting prosperity , the luxurious life of I Tatti . But all this can not be told here , even if I could . The orientalist , the aesthete , the scholar ; the fragile dandy in the exquisite gray suits ; the expert whom the dealers , in Kenneth Clark 's happy phrase , turned " from a poacher into a game-keeper " ; the suave and generous host ; the passionate collector of pictures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unfailingly life-giving , who was yet " as easily put off as mediumistic performers by the presence of doubters " ; the vehement and sometimes prejudiced politician ; the omnivorous , but not always discriminating , reader ; the guru of the young ; the candid autobiographer ; the spoiled child , the lover , and the sage : how could one draw so intricate a pattern , how discriminate fact from legend , in a few pages ? To dwell upon a single facet is in itself misleading , but it is the only possibility . The B.B. of whom I shall try to catch a glimpse is the one who happens to appeal to me most ? the ardent and insatiable traveler . In the course of seventy years , he became familiar with almost every museum and church , as well as with the most beautiful landscapes , in Europe , but it was always to the Mediterranean that he returned . " Almost everything that sets us above savages , " Ise would quote from Dr. Johnson , " has come to us from the shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double one , an outer journey toward a new scene and an inner one into the perceiving self . He noted , for instance , that the enjoyment of color was a pleasure acquired comparatively late . " I was not born with a feeling for it , and in Boston sixty-five years ago there was little to generate and educate a sense of it . " It was only after the revelation of " the atmosphere of disembodied colour " in the Upper Church at Assisi that his eyes were opened , and he gradually came " to enjoy colour as much as smell , almost as much as taste , and as sensuously . " With each such acquisition , he felt " as if born to a new kingdom , to an enlarged life , " which every passing year only intensified . " I am always increasingly aware , " he wrote at eighty-seven , " of what a sum of previously acquired knowledge is injected into those complex perceptions , hearing , taste and sight . " His unpublished letters to his future wife in 1890 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's accounts of their first journeys in Italy THE INSATIABLE TRAVELER : BERNARD BERENSON 'S QUEST together . The young man revealed is one to whom the years were to bring very few essential changes in character , though many in opinion . We find in his letters , for instance , a wholly disproportionate appreciation of the minor painters of the Veronese school , of whom he said in later years , " They taste like vinegar . " Sodoma was also accorded a measureless admiration , while all other Sienese painters after 1400 were dismissed as " simply dull and meaningless . " " When you meet Berenson a second time , " his old friend Israel Zangwill used to say , " you are beaten over the head for admiring what he taught you to admire the first , " and his wife 's phrase , " But , Bernard , you used to think . . . " became so well worn as to rouse all their friends to laughter and cause him to retort that his daily prayer had become " Give us this day our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " What , however , remained wholly unchanged was the zest of those first discoveries . " To be for ever learning ? never to petrify ? that is what I yearn for , " he wrote at twenty-four , and the wish was granted . He possessed to the highest degree that most enviable of talents , " the power of seeing everything each day as if it had never been seen before . " His wife wrote that , in all their years together , she could never remember his saying of any picture , " Oh , I 've already seen that ! " In his letters he shows a constant awareness of the dangers of treading new ground . The Berlin gallery , he wrote , made him feel " almost helplessly ignorant . Pictures tell you so much that you have to take care that they tell you no lies . . . . You can scarcely have an idea how little we really know about the history of Italian Painting , and how very much there is still left for the ' mere ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters is the writer 's unfailing capacity for delight . " What a wonderful thing it is , " Berenson writes from Dresden , " to be on a ladder , face to face with Giorgione 's Venus ! " His first glimpse of Piazza San Marco is utterly overwhelming . " When I passed through the arch and had my first look at the Campanile and at San Marco , I thought they would fall on me . I have read since that blind people suddenly restored to sight feel so about their first glimpses of the world . " At Montepulciano , after seeing for the first time San Biagio , he is " quite dizzy with happiness . " Even finding himself locked out of Siena after sundown has its own charm . " A city with walls and gates that really shut is a definite unit , not a mere conglomeration of houses . " Even in sleep his adventures do not end : he dreams one night that he is being shown " two unknown Giorgiones . I can see them at this minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to kindle an answering flame , and when at last Mary joined him on his travels , it is plain that , in spite of the storms and difficulties that lay before them , two happier and more absorbed young sightseers have seldom paced the Italian streets . In the Uffizi , Bernard insisted on leading Mary blindfold to the spot in the adjoining room from which she could best see , for the first time , the Primavera . In Rome they walked up the steep , narrow road leading to the Aventine " so intoxicated with new enchantments of thought and feeling " ( I am quoting Mary ) that a peasant who passed them said to his companions , " Stanno per baciarsi " ? " They are just going to kiss . " LTILE autumn of 1891 , in Verona , their life was as hard-working as it was frugal . They lived on five lire a day each , with Mary wearing her sister 's old clothes , breakfasted early at a cafe in Piazza dclle Erbe , and went sightseeing unceasingly all day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the pictures . " What a passion it was for us in those days , " wrote Mary , " to whisper to each other a new name for an old thing ! I can hardly understand it now , for it has become so much the thing we care for , and not the name . But then ! we used to wonder if Adam had half as much pleasure from naming the animals as we from naming those ancient paintings . " Not that they were always in agreement . Mary would complain of " the spiritual emptiness " of Paolo Veronese ; Bernard would rail at her " oeil dinigrant " ; they would part in anger , eat at separate restaurants , and then meet again to make it up , before the same picture over which they had quarreled . Moreover , Mary 's Quaker conscience would not allow her to leave Bernard alone . From their first acquaintance , it had driven her to influence him to " do something " with his work , to impart his conclusions , " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the effort of writing , which he disliked all his life , extremely distasteful , and besides felt very doubtful as to its value . " I still question , " he had written to Mary in early days , " whether it is at all possible to communicate a feeling for art to people , except by , personal contact . " He dreaded what he called " the danger of falling into literature ? I mean of getting to look at pictures as material for writing , of attempting to put great painting into bad prose . " He was , at this time , almost wholly without personal ambition . " Even if I went back to America , " he wrote to Mary in 1890 , " and just earned enough to live quietly somewhere with my sister I should be very happy , because I should have gathered enough impressions to occupy a whole lifetime . " Whether this was true may well be questioned , but it was undoubtedly sincere . And finally , his reluctance to write about art was based on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aside from the mere difficulty of composition is the fact that an fond ? do n't be surprised ? I am too honest , and too much in earnest . I am so deadly sick of lying and lies . . . . All I really know is once in a while the impression a picture makes upon me . . . . " Mary won ; the books were written , their author 's name was made . But now and again , as she herself has recorded , " in moments of conjugal tension , " B.B. would complain that she had " ruined his life by turning him from the disinterested contemplator of beauty into its vulgariser . " And when , toward the end of his life , he published a revised edition of his folios Painters of the Renaissance ( 1952 ) , he reaffirmed in the Preface his old tenet that what matters is not reading about pictures , but looking at them . " We must look and look and look till we live in the painting and for a fleeting moment become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving what through the ages has been loved , it is useless to lie ourselves into believing that we do . A good rough test is whether we feel that it is reconciling us with life . " IT WAS this search for a total self-identification with beauty , a Goethian reconciliation with the whole of life , that marked B.B. 's later journeys , as it had those of his youth . In the years between sixty-two and seventy-three ? the years in which , according to his own account , he began to he haunted by a wholly new " feeling of hurry " ? he embarked upon another series , of journeys . of which one might well write what he himself had said about his first trips to the Italian hill towns : " All the days carried to the evening the buoyancy of morning . " With his secretary , Nicky Mariano , as Angel to his Tobit ? for Mary was too ill to travel in her last years , and died in Florence in 1946 ? he went to Scandinavia , Turkey , Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tripolitania , Yugoslavia , and Asia Minor . Once again , after all the years of specialization and fame , he traveled as he had in the 1890s , just " to look and look and look . " Once again , he was caught up by the magic of what he called " Dahin-ness . " There were some external changes , of course ; one does not travel at seventy on five lire a day , or live on bread and onions . Mary Berenson has described the preparations : the letters of introduction " drifting in by every post , " the inoculations and the pills and the packing ? overcoats of three different weights , glasses and sunglasses , um-brellas and sunshades , sticks and fly whisks , brandy and camomile and Benger 's Food , and even jam and honey . " But the heaviest part of the luggage is books , " not only about the country the travelers were bound for , but " escape books , meant to be read when ruins and archaeology begin to pall : the Bible , poetry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traveler 's spirit had not changed . When he drove over the rocky desert track from Tripoli to Gadames , all that he cared for , in spite of the torrid heat , the sirocco , the suffocating dust , was the increase in his own awareness . " It has afforded me , " he wrote , " sensations of the desert such as I never got , even in Egypt or Algeria . " As , at twilight , they passed some campfires of the Touaregs , he remembered the description of an early Arab poet " of how the cinders of such fires recalled to him this or that love of the past , and renewed the ache and longing for the days of his youth . " At Gadames , where the whole little city is built within the oasis , around a large pool , he was completely enchanted . " The water bubbles and glitters as at the Clitumnus . The tunnelled alleys form a maze with frequent openings to the sky . Occasionally these widen , and settees , like those of Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns and ornamented stone walls , sit beggars , children , elders , notables . . . . Here at last I do get an impression of Africa . " At Leptis Magna , and later on at Cyrene , he was able to yield fully to his romantic love of ruins . " They are evocative and romantic , " he wrote at Leptis , " to a degree that it would be hard to exaggerate . " At Cyrene , in spite of cold so great that he sat writing indoors in a fur-lined coat , he wandered for hours among the rock-cut tombs of the acropolis . " The sentiment of all these invisible ghosts who lived and died in Cyrene down thousands of years , the silence of the ruins accentuated by the distant murmur of the sea , is more impressive than words can express . " And the last day before his departure closes on a note of triumph : " So 1 have been to Cyrene , and das kann mir Niemand wrgnehmen ! " ? " and that no one can take away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B.B. 's journeys , except for a brief return to Tripolitania at nearly ninety , began gradually to draw in , though only geographically . Always he had maintained that a voyage of rediscovery was even better than one of discovery : " The more I do a thing , the more I want to do it . " And so , in his eighties , it was with delight that he returned to the places in Italy he had loved most , to Rome and Venice , to Sicily , Calabria , and Romagna . His curiosity was as green as ever , his mind as open to any new idea . He was fascinated , " though I soon have enough of it , " by the new floodlighting of the Forum and the Capitol . " It satisfies our demand for ' otherness , ' our childish pleasure in the out of the way . " At Reggio , he was willing to admire the new sea front , with its prosperous buildings and public gardens . And at Venice he had no praise too high for Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the old monastic buildings had been turned into a great cultural foundation and the rest of the island into a training school for poor boys . He saw in it " a neo-monastic establishment " which , perhaps , " in the darkling , noisy and warring world into which we are already plunged , may play the same part that they had for centuries in our past . " Even when he could only deplore , as with regard to the tearing down of old buildings to produce wide highways , he asked himself whether his discomfort , in terms of the future , was not perhaps because " we attach our - own survival ( in a measure at least ) to things look , ing the way that we have always known them . " A friend whom he went to sec in Rome has set down , from what he told her , his day 's routine at eighty-two . Morning tea at 6:30 , writing until 8:45 , followed by breakfast with Nicky Mariano , and reading and writing with her until 9:45 . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single sight , savored at leisure ? until 12:30 , lunch with friends , a rest , and then out again for another sight or drive from 4 to 6 . People to tea , rest , other friends to dinner , and talk until 11:15 . Then bed , with Nicky reading aloud until 12:30 . And to this I must add that it was not infrequently that some busy ambassador or scholar would be fitted in for breakfast . When asked whether he did not find it too great a dispersal of his energies to see so many people , he replied that to talk to them was a way of paying one 's ticket , one 's passage through life . He considered himself a " life-enhancer , " and this could only be achieved by talk , not writing . Besides , he himself still received a great deal from people , a sense of usefulness , a vital warmth , the knowledge of the point which his mind had reached . His body told him that he was old , but his mind was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work , study , adventure . His last voyage of rediscovery , in his eighty-eighth year , took place very near home ; he decided to use the little strength still left to him in visiting the sights of Florence and its surroundings once again and " discovering my present relation to them . " It was then that he began to feel that all the beauty he needed could be found at his own door , not only in the landscape but in the " young people as lovely as flowers " whom he could see whenever he went out for a drive , " among the peasants working in the fields , the soldiers returning to barracks , the small townspeople out for a stroll . " He even sometimes then enjoyed what once had irritated him beyond bearing , the din of what he called " the human hive " ? carts going to market , workmen hammering and sawing , children shouting ? " because it spelt the presence of other human creatures . " This return to a feeling of sympathy with people of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been markedly lacking during most of his life , was not wholly new . He had known it once before , as a very young man , at the time of his conversion to Catholicism at Monte Oliveto . A few days after his acceptance into the Church , he went to Perugia and from there sent Mary a glowing description of the people strolling down the Corso in their Sunday best , listening to the band . " The sun was so bright , the people looked so merry , I felt such a love for them all . I even felt reconciled to the brass band . There it was playing , why not walk in step with it sweetly and gladly , instead of paralysing my legs by trying to march in a different step ? " The time came when , for all the beauty he required , there was no need to go beyond his own garden . He found in its flowers and trees a beauty and a variety unequaled by any work of art ; he discovered there , every morning , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Each day , as I look , I wonder where my eyes were yesterday . . . . I do not even have to look at pictures , for I have become my own painter . . . I require no sculpture , because my imagination has become so moulding that , having about me such models as the Tuscan peasantry , I can visualize them as statues in movement . " SO IT was that Berenson 's long pilgrimage came to an end . " This self , what is it ? For nearly seventy years I have been asking that question . " The figure he had presented to other people , he decided , had been merely " an image to which others approach as to a trading-port in old China " ; but what of the person he presented to himself ? " After so long a run " it seemed to him that he had come to live so much " in people , books , works of art , the landscape . . . that of self little is left over . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . So vivid , so complex a personality , one in which the ego had been called forth so readily by the vibrations of his interlocutors ; could it really become , as its owner at last stated , merely " a perceiving subject " ? Certainly the desire was not a new one . " As I look back on seventy years of awareness , " he wrote , " and recall the moments of greatest happiness , they were moments when I lost myself all but completely in some instant of perfect harmony . " His first experience of this nature , of the ecstasy to which he gave the name of " It-ness , " had come to him as a child of six , under a lime tree in early summer . It was this that he had sought in his first Italian journeys ( " I am sure , " he wrote to Mary , " that much of my love for Italy derives from the fact that it makes me completely forget myself " ) and had found during his conversion ? though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was precisely for this reason that he gradually slipped away from religion . " It was too personal to give him what he needed : it drove him in upon himself . . . while Art drove him out of himself , made him ask , not ' What am I ? ' but What is it ? ' " In the end he had come to think of " a complete life " as one " ending in so full an identification with the non-self that there is no self left to die . " In the last pages of his Self-Portrait he exclaimed , " It is easy now to live in ecstasy . " Was it this self-annihilation that he meant ? Those times of total abstraction which we all sometimes witnessed in his last years , that disconcerting fall of a shutter , almost in the midst of a sentence ; was it merely physical exhaustion , or a more deliberate withdrawal , not only from his friends but from him-self ? These were , I think , questions haunting the mind of many as he lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of his own Renaissance pictures , in a winding sheet made of his soft white cashmere shawl ? on the great central table in the library , which was , for all who had sat with him there , the very core of his house . He himself , indeed , had written of the whole house as " a library with living-rooms attached . " The body that lay there was so small , so frail , the exquisite long hands were worn to so fine a transparency , the face bore a look of such withdrawn serenity that it seemed easy to believe that there had been " no self left to die . " It was a still , golden day , and as we followed the coffin to the austere little Renaissance church of San Martino a Mensola , the scene was one of great harmony : the gentleness of the evening light , the pealing bells , the olives outlined against the sky , the country road on which he had started Out for so many autumn drives . It felt like a farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole world , perhaps to the last steady light of humanism in Europe . It seemed very natural , too , to imagine B.B. 's own glance falling ? not , perhaps , without a flicker of amusement ? upon the scene and upon the very diverse group of people who were gathered there , with no attempt at hierarchy : old friends and new , devoted nurses and faithful servants , royalties and diplomats and literary men , pretty young girls and old women in black shawls , the notables of Florence and the butcher and baker of Ponte a Mensola , the valletti del Comune in their scarlet liveries , with the banners of Fiesole and Florence , and the school children in their pinafores , carrying country posies . A few days later , I returned to I Tatti to see Nicky and went up with her to the working part of the library . Everything was as it had always been : the stillness , the neat and crowded shelves , the papers and photographs upon the tables , the stepladder onto which Nicky climbed to hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly we were both overcome by a tremendous sense of continuity , a consciousness of his presence almost greater than if , as so many times before , these books were about to be taken down to him for his own use . " If survival after death were conceivable , " he wrote , " I should with to be the in-dwelling soul of my house and library , " the library already bequeathed to the scholars who would come after him . " To speak more grossly , I should like to haunt it . " Perhaps he will .
