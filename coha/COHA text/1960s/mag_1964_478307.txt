It would not cost the American taxpayer a single penny . It would save untold millions of lives . It offers the one best hope ? perhaps the only hope ? of turning India into a going concern . In the long run it probably would prove to be the most effective thing we could do to keep Asia from being taken over by the Chinese variety of communism . " It " is a simple decision by our government ? specifically , the State Department with the support of Congress ? to back a plan to halt the surging growth of India 's population . The plan is ready to go . It has been carefully worked out by the India , Planning Commission with the help of the Ford Foundation staff in New Delhi , There is good reason to believe that it would work : pilot projects already are showing promising results . The plan has the enthusiastic ( but not very effective ) support of the Indian government . All that is lacking is a good , hard nudge from Washington . Obviously this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The issue really is n't very touchy politically ( as it might have been five years ago ) , but no Administration could reasonably be expected to embark on novel initiatives in the middle of a Presidential campaign . Early next year , however , the new Congress might be persuaded to do something about it ? especially if a fair number of voters show some interest in the subject during the course of the campaign . ( That is when politicians listen hardest to their constituents . ) Hence this report . If you who read it feel , as I do , that the Indian popula tion plan is a matter of first-rate importance ? to this country and to the world ? then perhaps you may want to mention it during the next few weeks to the Congressional candidates in your district , by mail or ( better yet ) in personal conversation . U ntil a few months ago I had never heard of the plan . I had been concerned about India 's desperate population problem ever since 1943 , when I watched ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some two million lives . Last spring I had a chance to take another look at the country ; and while there I had the good luck to meet Dr. Hugh Leavell , former Professor of Public Health Practice at Harvard and now a member of the Ford Foundation 's growing staff of family planning experts in New Delhi . What he and his colleagues are trying to do struck me as almost the only really encouraging thing I saw in that wretched land . Wretched for many reasons , but mostly because it seems doomed to never-ending hunger . The morning I started to write this , the New York Times reported that " a farmer in Uttar Pradesh committed suicide because he could not stand watching his children starve " ... " a thousand people broke into two food shops in Agra and looted them of grain " .. " hungry peasants in areas around Lucknow ate seed they had set aside for planting . " And the Times dispatch ended with the familiar , dread conclusion : that there is no visible hope for India 's 450 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than food production . ( Each year the country has another seven million mouths to feed ? adding , in effect , a city nearly as big as New York . ) The government of India , a feeble instrument at best , is struggling to check this human tidal wave . It has set up some five thousand birth-control clinics ; about one million people have volunteered for sterilization operations . But so far the results have been imperceptible , statistically speaking . Indeed , the population curve seems to be rising faster than ever , as the death rate is reduced by such public-health measures as spraying mosquitoes and building safe water systems . The net result is that millions of babies who once would have died within their first year from malaria or dysentery now grow up ? to face starvation . Facts such as these led the Ford Foundation to conclude that probably the most important thing it can do for India is to help carry the word about birth control into the half-million villages where 82 per cent of the population lives and breeds . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an able staff to try to figure out the best way to do it . Almost the first thing they decided was that birth-control clinics alone would n't work . Most villagers ? illiterate and shy ? would n't come near them . What might work is a health center , providing a full range of elementary medical services . After a peasant woman has learned to go there for antimalaria pills , cholera shots , and information on child care ? after she has come to know and trust the center 's staff ? then she might be willing to talk about family 16 THE EDITOR 'S EASY CHAIR planning . Moreover . once she is convinced that the center can protect her first two or three babies against the immemorial infant-killing diseases , she may be more eager to limit the size of her family . Today , with virtually no medical care available in rural areas , a mother often bears a dozen children with the expectation that only two or three will survive until their teens . The health centers , as they are envisaged , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take India a century to train enough of them , even if the money and the schools were available . Most of the personnel , therefore , would be public-health workers , who could be trained in about two years in the basic techniques of sanitation , preventive medicine , first aid , and birth control . Perhaps 90 per cent of their visitors could be helped on the spot. ; those needing serious surgery or medical treatment would be referred to the nearest hospital . And the center 's staff would be prepared to advise on all known methods of birth control , suggesting those appropriate to the patient 's state of health , income , and religious preferences . ( There is no substantial religious opposition to family planning in India ; but for the relatively few Catholics , the center would provide information on techniques approved by the Church . ) The most promising method at the moment seems to be the recently developed uterine spiral , a plastic device costing only a few cents . It has been tested by more than ten thousand women throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cases . It is cheap and simple enough for use by the poorest and most primitive families ; it is safe ; and it can he removed if the family should later decide that it wants another child . To set up enough health centers , even of the simplest kind , so that one of them will he within reach of every Indian family ( traveling by foot or bullock cart ) is a staggering enterprise . Yet Dr. Leavell thinks that it might , just possibly , be accomplished in ten years if everything goes well . ( That means a near-miracle , for in India hardly anything goes well ; a typical undertaking , from the digging of a well to the building of a defense force , proceeds by fits and starts , interspersed with intervals of lethargic discouragement . ) The first step would be to train 85,000 field workers to man the health centers . To do this it will be necessary to organize training schools , from fifty to two hundred of them , depending on the size finally decided upon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings would be going up all over the country . For administrative purposes , rural India is divided into blocks of villages , each containing roughly eighty thousand people . Dr. Leavell hopes eventually that ninety-seven field workers could be provided for each of these blocks ? enough to run three main health centers , plus three or four subcenters . The latter might he set up in trailers which could be moved from village to village . All of this obviously will cost a great deal of money ? more than even the Ford Foundation can afford . Nevertheless , Ford is moving ahead with demonstration projects in five of India 's states : West Bengal , the Punjab . Mysore , Madras , and Gujarat . Within five years , Dr. Leavell believes , these pilot establishments will have proved that population growth can be brought under control ? and public health vastly improved at the same time . Then maybe enough money can be found , somewhere , to put the plan into full operation throughout the entire nation . The government of India already has set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford people ? an Institute of Health Administration and Education . It hopes eventually to find enough money to pay the 85,000 field workers . But right now it sees no way to get funds to establish the training schools , build the health centers , and house the workers once they are on the job . Why does n't the Indian parliament simply raise taxes to finance a plan of such fundamental importance to the future of the country ? Well , a strong government would do just that . But even its most enthusiastic well-wishers can not describe the government of India as " strong . " Its Prime Minister is an elderly gentleman convalescing from a heart attack . He is beset , left and right , bypolitical enemies . The civil service he commands is inefficient , strangled in red tape , and in some spots corrupt . The amount of tax money that can be wrung out of a poverty-stricken country is strictly limited . And the government is confronted by many urgent demands on what little money it has ? including yet another threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borders which may pounce again at any minute . Furthermore , the Minister of Health is a nice old lady , Dr. Sushila Nayar , whose chief qualification is that she used to be Gandhi 's personal physician . In the intra-government battle for funds , she does n't stand much of a chance against the more vigorous ministers ? especially when they are clamoring for such immediate needs as more food and a better army . In sum , the government of India is hampered by the same kind of political problems that afflict every government , including our own ? hut its problems are more numerous and elephantine . Fortunately there is another potential source of money for the health program ? a very curious one . Some $331 million worth of rupees is lying idle in India right now , and the account is growing every day . Technically it belongs to the United States , but it can never be paid into the Treasury in Washington . It can be used only in India , for purposes jointly agreed upon by its government and ours , If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than enough to pay for Dr. Leavell 's ambitious plan . This money is so-called " counterpart funds , " or more precisely blocked local currency . Its history is complicated , and there is no need to explore it here. * It is enough to note that the device of counterpart funds was invented , nearly twenty years ago , largely in the hope that it might appease the Congressional critics of our foreign-aid program . In heroically oversimplified terms , the story runs something like this : * If you are interested in the full story , it is admirably told in John P. Lewis 's Quiet Crisis in India , originally published by the Brookings Institution and now available in a Doubleday Anchor paperback edition . Shortly after the end of World War II , India found itself ( as it so frequently does ) in desperate need of food . We had billions of bushels of surplus grain , moldering in storage at high cost to the American taxpayer . The Indians could n't pay for it ? no dollars , and no way to earn enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That seemed like good sense from every point of view : it kept millions of people from starving to death , and it reduced storage bills on grain we could n't use . The Administration was immediately accused in Congress of " giving away America 's assets to a pack of ungrateful foreigners . " Never mind that the " asset " in this case was an expensive burden ? the giveaway accusation was used with some effect by the opponents of every Administration , Democratic or Republican , of the last twenty years . After all , politics is not always a rational business . Squirming under these charges , the people in charge of foreign aid looked around for some kind of protective cloak . The device they hit upon was an ingenious one . " When we ship a boatload of wheat to India , " they suggested . " we might ask for payment in blocked rupees . The Indian government could sell the wheat to its own people , and turn over the proceeds to us . Since it will never be possible to convert these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , at least for us . But we can then tell Congress that we are n't giving anything away . We would be selling the grain for some counterpart ? the most we can get , even if it is only rupees in a blocked account . " It is doubtful whether this maneuver actually appeased the Congressional enemies of foreign aid , led by Otto Passman and the late Clarence Cannon . Probably it just confused them and inflamed their suspicions . But it did have useful byproducts , in a minor way . For example , some of the blocked rupees have been used to pay the local run- In fact , the idea of selling foodstuffs for blocked local money seems to have originated with the American Farm Bureau Federation , which wanted to expand overseas markets for our excessive output of wheat , cotton , and soybean oil . But the idea was eagerly seized by both the Administration and the farm bloc in Congress . ning expenses of the American Embassy , expand the information program , finance loans to small businessmen , and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal more could be put to good use in similar fashion if Congress would permit . Junior Embassy officers now have practically no travel money ; they could spend otherwise-useless rupees to get around the subcontinent , learning something about the vast country they are supposed to report on . American textbooks could be printed locally to help meet the desperate needs of India 's schools . ( The Russians , of course , are always glad to provide Marxist books at nominal cost . ) Special institutions could be set up to train business managers and public administrators , both urgently necessary to develop a modern economy and a healthy free-enterprise system . But , so far , the State Department has been afraid even to ask Congress to let it do these things . It has feared , with good reason , that the appropriations committees would say : " Okay , go ahead and use your blocked rupees ? but we 'll cut an equivalent sum out of the next aid appropriation . " Now , however , Cannon ? the longtime terror of aid administrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatchet man , Passman , has been at Aside from the 8331 million in rupees discussed here , which is now lying idle but earmarked for " U.S. use in India , " there are several other kinds of counterpart funds and blocked local currencies . in India and other countries which have received American aid . The limitation on their use varies , according to their legislative origin . Some arose out of Public Law 480 , some from repayment of Development Loan Fund " soft " loans , some from various other sources . It is hard to find out in Washington exactly how much is piled up , and where ? but the total runs into the billions . This accumulation of blocked foreign currencies is causing a variety of prickly economic problems , which grow more acute every year . It is high time for Congress to face up to the whole question ? and to give the Executive Departments a clear directive on how to dispose of these funds . Otherwise it is almost inevitable that eventually they simply will have to be wiped off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acrimony , in this country and abroad . THE EASY CHAIR least temporarily broken . Moreover , it is possible that reactionaries may not dominate the committees dealing with foreign aid quite so completely in the next Congress as they have for the last two decades . A few veteran Southern Democrats , for example , may be defeated by Republicans ? probably just as conservative , but lacking the seniority which is the key to power in the committee system . Consequently , we can hope that after the election the State Department , and the White House , will at last dare to talk more candidly to Congress about foreign aid ? especially the sensible use of counterpart funds . They will have some strong arguments at hand . The health-center program not only could be financed without any real cost to the U.S. Treasury ; it also offers hope of saving big lumps of foreign-aid money in the future . For unless India gets its population growth under control , we shall have to keep on giving immense tonnages of grain , fertilizer , and farm machinery for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventual collapse of orderly government ? the only democratic government in Southeast Asia : and eventual take-over by the Communists , or worse . ( " Worse " conceivably could mean a breakup of the nation into a multitude of warring states , something like the Congo today . That was about the condition of India before the British unified it : and in the old days , the sword , pillage , famine , and disease did keep the population fairly stable , Those were the traditional , or conservative , methods of population control . ) On the other hand , if India does succeed in curbing its population growth , it will at last have a chance to get on its economic feet . No longer would it be necessary to plow a lopsided share of its resources into efforts to raise more food from marginal lands . More resources would be available for industrial development ; savings could rise ; and in a decade or so India might reach the takeoff point into a modern economy , independent of foreign help . Perhaps never in history have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little cost . All that is needed , really , is the use of a little common sense .
