A light frost dappled the fields of western France . In Scotland and Nor way it snowed . Along the normally frigid beaches of the North Sea , water temperature dipped to a bone-chilling 59 , five degrees below average , and vacancy signs begged forlornly from windows of usually crowded tourist houses and pensions . From Land 's End to the Moscow River , from Scandinavia to northern Italy , the story was the same - Europe 's coldest , wettest , dreariest summer of the 20th century . <P> A steady downpour sent affluent Swedes to airline offices for reservations to distant Rhodes , Majorca and the Canary Islands . Londoners , who hoard summer sunshine for the cheerless English winter , were shortchanged with a meager 112 hours in July - 52% of normal - and gloomily settled down for the darkest summer since sunshine records were started in 1880 . Resorts in Normandy reported a probable 50% drop in tourist business because of the cold and rain , and Paris recorded the coldest July in its history . <P> Dutch television , which regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs for shut-in tourists , and German resort directors hurriedly fattened concert afternoons with movies , slides , dances and quizzes . In Hungary , Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia , steady rains flooded the Danube and its tributaries . <P> As if to add a grim symmetry to the misery , the French Riviera-one of the Continent 's few sunny spots-was seared by one of the worst forest fires in its history . Flames , swept on by a 60-mile-an-hour mistral from the Rhone Valley , devoured 32,000 acres of tinder-dry pine forest and sent tourists scurrying to the beaches , where a flotilla of French navy vessels and pleasure boats ferried them to safety . <P> Altogether , the summer of 1965 was not likely to be forgotten . As if to tease Continentals , a dazzling sun broke through the clouds at midweek-only to disappear by week 's end in the accustomed gloom . For the French , the season had been un t pourri ( a rotten summer ) . The Germans said it was n't a summer at all-they called it " the green winter . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
