By the account of a recent album he recorded , Frank Sinatra , 50 , is in the September of his years . But as the days dwindle down to a precious few , he 's decided to make the most of them by marrying Mia Farrow , 21 , Maureen O'Suilivan 's actress daughter . After keeping steady company with her for more than a year , Frankie took her home to mother and gave her a ding-a-ding ring , nine carats heavy and worth something like $100,000 . Said Old Pal Joey Bishop : " It looked like Plymouth Rock had been lowered onto Columbus Circle . " <P> " The light came in from the east . And then there came the sharp compelling cry-the most awesome , happiest sound known to human ears , the first child of Sam and Rebekah Johnson was discovering America . " So wrote Lyndon 's mother in the family album in 1908 . The celebrated passage now hangs , framed , in the replica of his five-room birthplace , which has just been built on the original 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential shrine , which is just a mile from the present L.B.J. ranch : a china-doll clown that was a Christmas present to an aunt from little Lyndon , then four . " He proudly handed it over , " burbled a White House press release , " telling her delightedly that it cost a dime and was worth every cent of it . " <P> Nice , good , old John <P> Some other writers ' Grapes of Wrath <P> Are still to come <P> But is it possible <P> That yours are only in the past ? <P> So wrote Soviet Poet Evgeny Evtushenko in Literaturnaya Gazeta , addressing his nice , good , old pal John Steinbeck , whom he met during the author 's 1963 visit to Russia . Evtushenko was scolding Steinbeck for not speaking out against the Vietnamese war . <P> Steinbeck , who has a son with the Armed Forces radio in Saigon , replied with an open letter of his own . " My dear friend Genya , " he wrote , " You know well how I detest all war , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am against this Chinese-inspired war . I do n't know a single American who is for it . But , my beloved friend , you asked me to denounce half a war , our half . If you could persuade North Viet Nam to agree in good faith to negotiate , the bombing would stop instantly . The guns would fall silent and our dear sons could come home . " <P> From the very first he did splendidly , winning an Emmy in his first year and holding his own against TV 's mightiest ( Milton Berle , Groucho Marx , Lucille Ball ) . Then in 1957 he announced his retirement " from the lights of TV to the shades and shadows of the Cross . As the retirement was dictated by spiritual considerations , so will be the moment of return . " The exact spiritual considerations are not known , but Uncle Miltie has announced his return to the silver tube and so now has Uncle Fultie . Beginning in the fall on 30 syndicated stations , New York 's Bishop Fulton J. Sheen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life Is Worth Living , as it was before , but just plain The Bishop Sheen Program .
