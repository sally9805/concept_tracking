Along with a new shade of blue in their uniforms the Lions are reported to have a new attitude , the one-big-happy-family approach . This is supposed to cure all internal problems and , therefore , the Lions ' sad-sack play . It is going to take more than togetherness , however , to lift the Lions above last year 's sixth-place finish in the West . // Detroit had a decent team but too many cliques . The linemen blamed the backs , and the backs the linemen , for missed plays , and everyone criticized Quarterback Milt Plum , who had an " off " year by his standards , a bad year by most others . He finished 14th in passing , although not too many years back he was leading the league . Plum 's timing was off , and his receivers were forced to make circus catches on what should have been routine passes . There was some question whether Plum would return ( " Get rid of those guys or me , " he has said in reference to his teammates ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to stick with him . He really had no other choice . The backup men , George Izo and Tom Meyers , are not ready for the job . It is not considered good form to ask Gilmer why he traded Earl Morrall to New York . Gilmer is quite right in saying that any old pro would have looked good in view of the Giants ' desperate need , but he is a little touchy on that subject . // For a long time now the Lion offense has lacked a really dangerous running attack . Nick Pietrosante , the old Notre Dame fullback , is a reliable short-haul runner and a superb blocker , but no defensive coach in the league has ever developed an ulcer over his ability to break a ball game . Joe Don Looney , with the power of a Jim Brown , has the poise of a Brownie . That leaves Amos Marsh , acquired from the Dallas Cowboys , and Tom Nowatzke , a big Pietrosante-type fullback who is in his second season . It does not add up to enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that means that the Detroit defense , which began grumbling several years ago about the preponderance of time it spent in action , will be in action more than half the time again this year . Good as that defense is , it is growing older and under overwork conditions it will tire . // The inept running attack also hinders the efforts of a really good set of pass catchers . It is not surprising that Gail Cogdill , who might lead the league each year on another team , allowed his frustration to cost him $1,000 during the off season . Last winter his snappish remarks about the Detroit management resulted in a suspension and the fine . The suspension  --  with the season coming up  --  has been lifted , but the fine is still in effect . Another eminent target for Plum is Pat Studstill , a slight , quick and determined young man who caught more passes than any one on the club after he went in to replace Terry Barr last year . Barr has since retired , but Studstill can fill his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved over from Green Bay a year ago , has always been one of the best men at the position in the league and there is no reason to think he will be less . If he is , there is Jim Gibbons , who is very good . // There is as yet no glaring weakness in the defense , which has been brutally good for years . The pass rush of Darris McCord , Alex Karras , Roger Brown and Larry Hand ( the last replacing Sam Williams , who has gone to Atlanta ) is feared , as it should be . Depth is what is lacking . Joe Schmidt has retired at middle linebacker , leaving a grievous replacement problem . Turned coach , he has given Mike Lucci his old job and has also given him the responsibility of calling defensive signals . Wayne Walker , the right linebacker and place kicker , is quality , and the secondary of Bobby Thompson , Dick Le-Beau , Bruce Maher , and Wayne Rasmussen have had the benefit of a year 's experience together and should improve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his players have taken a turn for the better . Karras. no great Gilmer fan last season , has been named team captain , and Gilmer even shortened practice one day in July to lead some of his charges on a picnic . The air of **26;298;TOOLONG must be a welcome relief , but Gilmer 's problems are much more physical than psychological . // With an unsure quarterback , a serious lack of running backs and only young and untried players for much-needed replacements in depth , it seems unlikely that the Lions will improve upon their finish of last season . Indeed , with the strong upsurge of the Los Angeles Rams , it would appear more likely that the sorely beset Lions will subside into last place . // This will not , of course , be Harry Gilmer 's fault . Gilmer is a bright , resourceful young man who wrought wonders with the Vikings under the tutelage of Norman Van Brocklin before coming to Detroit . But at Minnesota he had some material to work with . // Unfortunately , in too many spots on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lions out of pussycats this year .
