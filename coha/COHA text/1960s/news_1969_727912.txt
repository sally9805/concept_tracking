txt Clark M. Clifford , the former Secretary of Defense , has publicly called on President Nixon to scale down military operations in Vietnam and to schedule the withdrawal of all American ground combat forces from that country by the end of next year . Only such a policy of acknowledged disengagement , Mr. Clifford contends , will compel the Saigon Government to broaden its political base and to assume a proper share of the fighting . if the Saigon forces can not by that time maintain themselves with continuing American logistic and air support . he says , they never will be able to do so . Mr. Clifford 's comments follow closely upon similar statements made recently by W. Averell Harriman and Cyrus R. Vance , the chief negotiators at the Paris talks on Vietnam during the final year of the Johnson administration , in which Mr. Clifford also served . Public Debate Is Objective Together , they reflect an effort by the most dovish former officials to stimulate a public debate that might influence their successors . Although the Nixon Administration is preparing to withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereafter as the Southl Vietnamese forces prove capable of taking their place , Mr. Clifford and the other critics from the former Administration argue that genuine disengagement requires a much faster rate of withdrawal and a total change of strategy . Writing in the July issue of Foreign Affairs quarterly , Mr. Clifford traces the evolution of his thinking on Vietnam from his days as a hawk , prior to mid-1967 , to the present . The big change , he recalls , ' // occurred shortly after he succeeded Robert S. at the Pentagon in March , 1968 , when he concluded that the United States could not achieve military victory by tolerable means , could not afford it and . indeed . no longer needed it . " The forces we now have deployed and the human and material costs we are now incurring have become . in my opinion , out of all proportion to our purpose . " Mr. Clifford writes . Unless imaginative and courageous decisions to disengage ' are taken at once , he maintains . the United States will be ! no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' soldiers have lost their lives . The article is based on argu- , ments that Mr. Clifford has of- ' ten ' made to top officials of both the Johnson and Nixon Administrations as well as to influential groups of citizens . such as the Council on Foreign Relations . It was completed in early May , before Mr. Nixon announced his plan to recall 25,000 men from Vietnam , but remains timely in Mr. Clifford 's view . Any ' Palliative ' Deplored IC the President intends to pull out all ground combat forces by the end of 1970 , Mr. Clifford said in an interview today , then his announcement at Midway Island June 8 of withdrawl plans will have been a " signal service " to the nation . But he would he deeply disappointed , Mr. Clifford added , if the withdrawals scheduled so far turn out to be " purely a palliative to allay public sentiment . " As these comments suggest , current policies of the Nixon regime could eventually evolve ' into something similar to Mr. , Clifford 's proposal . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disengaging now has not been taken . Although the Nixon Administration has been considering a number of plans to take tens or thousands of American soldiers out of Vietnam in the next year . it has refused to commit itself to any prearranged schedule of withdrawals or to any time limit . Moreover , the Administration insists that United States troops can safely pull out of the war zone only as the South Vietnamese forces show themselves able to replace them in battle . Deadline Held Essential Mr. Clifford argues . to the contrary , that the Government , of President Nguyen Van Thiettl will make no political concessions to other political groups in South Vietnam and will not help the United States to disengage until its leaders are confronted with a deadline for ending Washington 's commitment to ground combat . Mr. Clifford is critical also of Washington 's refusal to change the military orders inherited from the Johnson Administration . namely the order id seek out and destroy the ' enemy far from Vietnam 's popelation centers and to maintain " maximum military pressure . " " The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casualties without any discernible impact on the peace negotiations in Paris . " he writes . This point of view is known have been raised inside the Nixon Administration . But the President appears so far to hay supported the judgment of his , field commanders who contend ! ! that a pullback to enclaves ; , around the populated areas to ! await enemy attacks would result in even higher casualty . rates . In developing his proposal . Mr. Clifford suggests a withdrawal of at least 100.000 ground combat soldiers before ! the end of this year and the withdrawal of the rest ? beItween 100,000 and 150.000 ? during 1970 . That would leave , 290000 to 300,000 American servicemen in Vietnam in 1971 to provide logistic and air sup , port for the various components of the South Vietnamese forces , , totaling about a million men . These remaining forces ! should be able to prevent the ' imposition of a Hanoi-controlled regime , Mr. Clifford writes . If the South Vietnamese " lack a ; sense or a sufficiency of nation ; al purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on them . " He argues that such a with- , drawal from ground combat not only would test the will ; and capacity of the Saigon forces , but might actually in-I ! duce the North Vietnamese tot take a greater interest in nego , tiating a mutual and more rapid withdrawal ' of all outside : troops . Statin a thesis that has also been used to explain the much ! more gradual and modest with- ; ! dra.vals ordered by the Nixon ! , Administration , Mr. Clifford ! says : " Hanoi would be faced with ; the prospect of a prolonged and ; substantial presence of Ameri- , can air and logistics personne'l in support of South Vietnam 's ? combat troops , which would bel constantly improving in of- ! ficiency . Hanoi 's only alterna- ; Live would be to arrange , tacit- ; ly or explicitly , for a mutual ! withdrawal of all external ! forces . " In either eventuality , the re- ; suiting balance of forces should ! avert any danger of a blood ' bath which some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal . "
