In a series of articles entitled Zero of the Lions ( SI , Sept. 7 &amp; 14 , 1964 ) , which he expanded into the best-selling book Paper Lion , the author wrote of his excruciating experiences as an amateur NFL quarterback . Now , despite an 18 handicap , he has pitted himself against big-time golf . The result , on the course , was what could be expected from Zero : nothing . But his account of his travails in last year 's Bing Crosby National Pro-Amateur , and during the two weeks that followed , constitutes an amusing and poignant look at the pro tour , the amateur golfer and the game itself . This first of a three-part series describes a ball-stealing caddie , the rage of a pro partner and two days in a cloud of bogey dust . // I had a notion that a month on the professional golf tour , competing steadily and under tournament conditions before crowds and under the scrutiny of the pros with whom I would be playing , might result in five , perhaps even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 18. // My friends thought so , too . They envied me my invitations to the Bing Crosby National Pro-Amateur , the Lucky International in San Francisco and the Bob Hope Desert Classic in Palm Springs  --  the near month of tournament play in the pro-ams that I would enjoy on the tour  --  and they said that the one compensation they could think of as they toiled at their desks was that on my return I would not be as likely to embarrass them with my bad golf on our occasional weekend rounds . // I was hopeful but also uneasy , aware that quite an overhaul of my game was going to be necessary . My woes in golf , I have felt , have been largely psychological . When I am playing well , in the low 90s , I am still plagued with small quirks  --  a suspicion that , for example , just as I begin my downswing , my eyes straining with concentration , a bug or a beetle is suddenly going to materialize on the ball . And when I am playing badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I commit myself to a golf swing that my body changes its corporeal status completely and becomes a mechanical entity , built of tubes and conduits and boiler rooms here and there , with big dials and gauges to check , a brobdingnagian structure put together by a team of brilliant engineers but manned by a dispirited , eccentric group of dissolutes. // I see myself as a monstrous , manned colossus poised high over the golf ball , a spheroid that is barely discernible 14 stories down on its tee . From above , staring through the windows of the eyes , which bulge like great bay porches , is an unsteady group ( as I see them ) of retired Japanese navy men . In their hands they hold ancient and useless voice tubes into which they yell the familiar orders : " Eye on the ball ! Chin steady ! Left arm stiff ! Flex the knees ! Swing from the inside out ! Follow through ! Keep head down ! " Since the voice tubes are useless , the cries drift down the long corridors and shaftways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambers and out , until finally , as a burble of sound , they reach the control centers . These posts are situated at the joints , and in charge are the dissolutes I mentioned  --  typical of them a cantankerous elder perched on a metal stool , half a bottle of rye on the floor beside him , his ear cocked for the orders that he acknowledges with ancient epithets , yelling back up the corridors , " Ah , your father 's mustache " and such things , and if he 's of a mind he 'll reach for the controls ( like the banks of tall levers one remembers from a railroad-yard switch house ) and perhaps he 'll pull the proper lever and perhaps not . So that , in sum , the whole apparatus , bent on hitting a golf ball smartly , tips and convolutes and lunges , the Japanese navy men clutching each other for support in the main control center up in the head as the structure rocks and creaks . And when the golf shot is on its way the observers get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report : " A shank ! A shank ! My God , we 've hit another shank ! " // The Japanese navy men stir about and shout , " Smarten up down there ! " // In the dark reaches of the structure the dissolutes reach for their rye , tittering , and they 've got their feet up on the levers and perhaps soon it will be time to read the evening newspaper . // When I got out to the Monterey Peninsula , where the Crosby is played , and met some of the professional golfers , I asked them timidly if such wayward thoughts ever popped into their minds at a moment of crisis on the course  --  some image quite apart from golf . // Well , what sort of thoughts , they wanted to know . // I told them , somewhat haltingly , about the retired Japanese naval officers , a phenomenon I had never been able to explain to myself , and they stared and said , well no , they were n't harassed by any such thoughts as that . If pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and murmuring encouragement . Dave Marr told me that , as he stood over his putt on the 16th green during the PGA championship he won at Laurel Valley in 1965 , clear as a bell he heard his baby 's voice call in his head , " Careful , Daddy , careful ! "  --  just as the baby did when he was being tossed joyfully in the air , roughhousing at home . Marr , hearing his son 's voice , was careful , so careful that his putt ended up short . He two-putted from there . When Jack Nicklaus chipped in a remarkable shot on the 17th and came within two strokes of Marr 's lead the childish voice disappeared , to Marr 's relief , and in its place a somewhat more aggressive voice began to cajole , " Do n't let him in , dammit , just lock the guy out ! "  --  which Marr was able to do on the last hole to win his championship . // Marr told me that what good golfers usually see in their mind 's eye is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball , which is what the average golfer sees , but where the ball is going to end up . // " When you 're playing at your best , " he told me , " you look down at the ball on the tee and you see the fairway and the spot out there where your shot 's going to land . It 's almost like looking at those scorecards that have a map of each hole , and the play of the hole is marked in dotted lines . What you see is the dotted line . Of course , if you 're playing bad , what you see are the woods and the traps , Marlboro Country , and more often than not , if that 's what you 're thinking , that 's where your shot is going to end up . " // I told him about my premonition that a large insect would suddenly appear on my golf ball just as I was bringing my club down . // " A what ? " // " A bug , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Man , what a thing to suggest . You hang around the tour long enough , " he said , " and get us golfers worrying about things like bugs , and no one 's going to come close to hitting the ball a foot . You 're dangerous , man , too dangerous . " // " Well , I do n't know , " I said . // He was grinning . " If you do n't mind , just do n't tell us too many things like that , " he said . // MOMENTS WITH SAM AND BEN // While my invitation to the Crosby allowed me to enter the world of professional golf and see it firsthand , it was not , in fact , my first opportunity to play with top golfers . Five or six years before I had played a head-to-head match with Sam Snead at Boca Raton . Snead rode out onto the course in a yellow golf cart that bore him off after his shots so rapidly that I rarely had a chance to talk with him . We met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate sounds of awe when he whacked his drives off into the distance . He would climb into his cart while I set my ball up on its tee . When I made my shot , off at an angle usually , Snead would say , " I reckon you hedged somewhat on that one , " and he 'd set off in the cart . We were playing as a threesome , and the third member of our group , a former captain of the Harvard golf team , rode in the cart with Snead , since their drives were generally on the same line . I moved behind them , ranging back and forth for my errant shots with my caddie  --  the pair of us like two seabirds far in the wake of a trawler . // " It was that damn cart , " I said later in the locker room when we were done . " I might have got something out of the afternoon if it had n't been for the speed of that thing . " // Snead was not around to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessmen as soon as we had come in from our tour of the course . When I came running over from the 18th green to say goodby he was already on his way to the first tee to join them . He waited for me to reach him . " Pigeons , " he said , taking me into his confidence . He winked broadly . I forked over the $15 I owed him from a $5 Nassau bet . // " Good luck , " I said , still breathing hard from the trot up the 18th fairway. // I mournfully described the match to a member in the locker room : " Snead could have been playing his shots like-a polo player from that cart . The round was that fast . I mean , he could have been just rising up from his seat , leaning out and flailing at the ball .... They ought n't to allow carts . " // The member rang for the steward and ordered drinks . To take my mind off my disappointment , he said that Boca Raton had been famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nabobs of the early ' 20s . He told me that one of the latter , Clarence Geist , played the course in a specially equipped Packard . It was a familiar sight on the fairways , though startling to those seeing it for the first time . The Packard would lurch out of a grove of trees onto the course , and a player back on the tee , looking up from his ball , would call out , " My God , what 's that ? " // " That 's Clarence Geist 's Packard. " // " Well , yes , but what is it doing out there ? Look at the size of that thing ! Think of the ruts it must leave in the fairways . Why does n't the good man  --  what 's his name ? " // " Geist. " // " Why does n't he use a rickshaw ? Or at the least a Model T ? " // They would watch the limousine stop far down the fairway , and then a distant figure being assisted out of the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if inspecting a road map , cataleptic until the flash of a club swinging , the heads turning to watch the flight of that far-away , invisible ball . Then the group would load up into the Packard again , which would rock off across the undulations of the fairway. // " That 's very interesting , " I said . I was still petulant about Snead . " Today was a waste . I certainly never got the sense of what it 's like to play against a championship golfer . " // " Why do n't you try Ben Hogan ? " the member asked . He said he 'd call him  --  he was a good friend  --  and put in a word for me . Hogan was in the vicinity preparing for the Masters , as he did annually at the Seminole Golf Club north of Palm Beach . // I called Hogan a few days later . I explained somewhat haltingly that I wanted to write an article about competing against great professionals . Perhaps a match with him could be arranged . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice in reply  --  polite and easy , and it took me a time to realize that he was turning me down . He said that our mutual friend had described the notion to him . He said he had no objection to playing a friendly match , perhaps in a foursome along with the friend who had put us in touch . But he said if I intended to write about him , about playing against him in a competition , well , that was another matter . The conditions would have to be those of a tournament . // " But , Mr. Hogan , " I said , " the chances of our meeting in a tournament ... I mean , are you suggesting that I turn pro ? My handicap is 18 , Mr. Hogan. " // " Well , that 's your problem , " he said . He was not being unkind or scornful . He had an acute sense of what the great component of his ability was  --  the competitiveness  --  and if it was to be described , he wanted it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tournament conditions . // I told the Boca Raton member about it , and he smiled . " I rather expected that , " he said . " Well , you had the chance to find out about that man 's pride . That must be worth something . " // " Well , sure , " I said . " Sure . It must be . " // PHONE CALL TO BRUNO // When I arrived at Pebble Beach for the Crosby , I checked in at the Del Monte Lodge . // " No , " the ladies behind the tables in the tournament headquarters said , " Mr. Hogan is not playing in the Crosby this year . Your partner is "  --  they looked it up on the pairing sheets  --  " Bob Bruno . Tomorrow you 'll go off with him at the Monterey Peninsula Country Club in a foursome with Manuel de la Torre and his amateur partner , Bill Henley . " // They gave me Bruno 's telephone number . He was staying at a small motel in Monterey . I called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's practice . He would meet me tomorrow on the first tee . I told him about my golf , my 18 handicap , and I said I hoped he would n't mind being saddled with such a thing . He sounded very pleasant . He said no , that for " ham ' n ' egging "  --  that is to say , combining in a good partnership )  --  a player with a high handicap , if he got onto his game , could be tremendously useful . // Afterward I asked around about him . No one knew much , except that he was awfully big . He turned out to be 6 ' 5 " , about the tallest professional on the tour  --  up there , with George Archer and George Bayer . His best paydays had been none too glorious , a 10th at St. Paul in 1964 , where he won $1,675 , and a 12th at Seattle that same year , for which he won $1,100. // Bruno 's status as a golfer ( and he would admit it , if ruefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in the category known as " rabbits . " These were golfers on the tour who were beginning their careers , or whose play was erratic or in the doldrums . They had to play in a qualifying tournament  --  usually held on a Monday  --  and fight it out among themselves for the available slots in the draw of the regular tournament . In the Los Angeles Open , for example , which preceded the Crosby , there had been 20 open slots in the draw for which about 250 " rabbits " had been forced to compete . // " Bruno may be a rabbit , " someone said , " but he could be a very fine player , a much better one , if he would retain his composure . " // " His what ? " I asked . // " Well , his difficulties with golf sometimes get the better of him . You 're likely to find out . It 's rather distressing . " I must have looked concerned . " Maybe it wo n't happen , " my informant said brightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six strokes a side , and the two of you will get along fine , just fine . " // THE HIRING OF ABE // I went around to the pro shop at Del Monte Lodge and inquired about getting a caddie for the tournament . Almost all the golfers , I was told , both professional and amateur , had already checked in , and most of the caddies had been assigned . There might be somebody left out back , they said . // I looked out there , and a caddie hurried up and introduced himself . Abe , his name was  --  a very small man encased in oversized clothes , an extra-long windbreaker over a worn dark sweater , the baggy pants of a top-banana comedian hanging loosely on him and making him look , from afar , like a waif. // Abe said that I was lucky to get him . He was n't just any " bag-toter . " He knew the three Monterey courses from 20 , maybe 30 years ' experience and had " packed " bags for some of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro ? " he asked hopefully . // " I 'm afraid not , " I said . // We went out that afternoon to get in as much of a practice round as we could before darkness fell . We played the ocean holes of Pebble Beach under a setting sun . Out in the sea hundreds of whales were moving north , so that sometimes , looking out , one could spot a dozen or so spouts at the same time , a feather of spray , pink in the dying sun , and then the distant dark roll of the body beneath . // Abe said as we walked along that he was originally a seafaring man . He had come west from Massachusetts , and he had been with the sardine fleet out of Monterey in the days when the schools were thick and lay out beyond the kelp beds . He had become a furniture mover after that , caddying when he had the time . And in the evening , when the tides were right , he went down to the rocks and beaches where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cypress Point and Pebble Beach and , equipped with a long pole and a sack , he scraped around for lost golf balls . // He told me that on a good day he would come up out of the sea with his sack full up with balls . The activity was not quite legal because of the trespassing laws , so he would set out for home across the golf course with his coat buttoned and straining across the bulge of the sack . His notion was that the club officials , if they saw him out there , might take him for a pregnant woman out for a stroll in the twilight  --  that was his hope . // " They would have had to be pretty nearsighted , Abe , " I said , looking at him . We were waiting on the 6th for a pair in front of us . He was so short that he had to carry my golf bag slantwise on his back , like a soldier carrying a bazooka , and I noticed that the clubs often began to slide out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cigarette , so that it developed long curved ashes that wavered and finally dropped whole to lie on the grass like gray cicada husks . He had a terrific smoker 's cough and wheeze . // " The top day I ever had on the beaches , " he was saying , " was 350 balls . I dragged myself across the course that day . They seen me , they 'd thought I was having twins , two big ones . In the golf shops I could count on getting 50 a ball if they were n't too sea-logged . Then the price was 20. " // The wait continued . I asked Abe if he had ever played golf . He thought about it and said that in 25 years he had played three holes . In fact , he had played the last of the holes not more than two weeks before . I asked how it had gone . He said that for someone just keeping his hand in , he was n't so bad . He had n't kept score because , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tournament . Besides , he had only used one club . // I had a good round that afternoon , playing relaxed golf , and Abe , when I told him my handicap was 18 , whistled and said " we " would have an interesting tournament . // I noticed that , like many caddies , he referred to his golfer as " we " when things were going well . After a good drive he would say , " We 're right down the middle . Yessir , we 're right down the damn pike . " In adversity , the first person " we " was dropped and the second and third person would appear . The caddie would say after gazing at a duck hook : " You 're dead . You 're off there way to the left . " Or in reminiscing to another caddie about a day 's round , he would shift gears in mid-sentence : " So we 're right down the fairway , lying one , and then what does he do but hit it fat . " // It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tournament was 10:15 the next morning . Abe said that he would come and fetch me very early for some work on the practice tee . He told me to get a good rest . // A friend at the lodge had seen the two of us walk in from the course . " Who 's that little guy with you ? " he had asked . // " My caddie , " I said . // " You 're in trouble . He does n't look like he can lift a golf ball , much less a bag . And what was that sound ? " // " He wheezes somewhat , " I said . " Hell , he 's a professional furniture mover. " // " What does he carry , tea tables ? " my friend said . // " You wait , " I said . " You just wait . " // PRACTICE TEE TACTICS // One item I had not thought to bring on the tour was a bag of practice balls . The Del Monte Lodge did not supply the familiar wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rent at almost all country clubs . Abe had told me not to mind . He said he would scrounge around his house and bring some practice balls with him the next morning so we could get some " loosening up " before the first round started . He said he had some balls " down cellar , " he thought , from his shoreline-collecting days , and he would fetch them up . // Early the next morning he banged on the door of my room at the lodge , and I could hear him breathing and clearing his throat , and he called out , " Do n't be keeping too long . " So I got ready , and we walked out to the practice tee through the early morning , with the faint ground mist easing off the grass and a chill in the air that reminded one of duck-shooting dawns . It was still so dark on the tee that with a few golfers already practicing one heard rather than saw the quick swish of the wet-weather gear of a golfer in his swing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the hum of the ball flying out over the dark field . Far in the distance the caddies , just dark shapes from where we were , could look up and see the ball against the sky , which was light , so they could follow its flight and move accordingly . Pretty soon , with the sun coming quickly , the balls sailing out would , at the top of their trajectory , glow gold suddenly , like planets . Down below , where we stood , it was still dark . A tall line of pines close behind us cut the light , and one could hardly see the wooden tee in the grass on which to place the ball . // Abe had a fishnet bag with him , a small clutch of balls bunched in the bottom . We found a place in the line , and he rolled the practice balls out on the tee . There were about eight of them . Even in the gloom I could see their condition  --  one of the balls rolling erratically , like a pear  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got in there ? " // " Gutta-percha ? " // " They just seem a mite shopworn , " I said . // " Well , " Abe said , " I keep things down cellar I ca n't get rid of easy . " // He strolled out across the practice field , his fishnet bag dangling loosely . I hit some eight-and nine-irons to him , just to get limber , and the rickety balls fluttered out to him noisily , like paper in a windstream . I noticed Abe ranged after them with great agility , and even when I was teeing up a ball he seemed to be moving about out there in the gloom , looking and darting like a cattle egret. // Paul Christman , the former football star and a broadcaster at present , was down the line from me . He was also hitting out short irons . He had an eye on Abe . // " That caddie of yours has great range , " he called to me . " He 's moving around like a free safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abe except the one that had rolled like a pear . It had done so , as I now could see in the brightening light , because a portion of its interior protruded like a polyp from a rip in the cover . I waved for Abe . He trotted in . He gave a glance at the remaining ball . // " I thought it might explode if I hit it , " I said . // " No mind , " he said . He poured the contents of his fishnet bag out on the grass . There were now about 20 balls , many of them shockingly bright and pristine , with not a mark on them except perhaps , as I imagined suddenly , a small PC for Paul Christman stamped on the cover . Christman was a very serious amateur golfer , the sort who might stamp his practice balls . He was always on the practice tee when I looked out there . // I peered warily down the line toward him . Abe was wheezing loudly with pleasure . " I got us some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , softly . " So I see . " // When the sun pulled up over the pines and the practice field shone in its light , Abe had to cut down on his activities . But his fishnet bag was always bulkier when we had finished a morning 's practice . I noticed that he thinned out the crop when he got home , picking out the best ones , because each morning he would arrive with his " down cellar " balls , the original seven or eight , the ball with the polyp among them . // " I thought we had more of these , " I said one morning . // " I found eight balls down cellar . You lost one when you hooked it that time . Now there are seven , " he said to me , reproachfully . // THE FIRST HOLE // I met Bruno out on the tee on the first day of the tournament . He seemed serious and well-meaning , a big-featured man with a slightly pocked face . He was wearing a black golfers glove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night before . He is very difficult to get up , he went on . People really have to work on him , pummel him and pull , and sometimes they just give up . He did n't want that to happen , so he had had a long night 's rest . And there he was , he said smiling , ready to tear the course apart . // The first hole at Monterey was a par-5 , an easy one , perhaps the easiest hole in the tournament , downhill off an elevated tee , onto a wide fairway through the pines , mottled with the slants of the early-morning sun flickering through , and the shadows blue-green . The pro shop is set right behind the first tee . A small crowd was on hand . It was cold , and many of them were in the pro shop looking out through the plate-glass window . // Bruno and I won the honor . I drove first . " Keep it easy , " I kept telling myself . The shot boomed down the fairway , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectators clicked their rings and knuckles against the glass in approbation . Bruno was delighted . // " Holy smoke ! " he said . // I had a good lie , and my second shot was nearly as long as the first , and straight , rolling up to within 40 yards of the green . // " We 're moving , " said Abe . // As we walked along , I began to feel guilty about my 18 handicap . Would the golf committee complain ? Would fingers be pointed and voices lowered when I entered the Del Monte Lodge with six natural birdies on my scorecard  --  our team score some 17 or 18 strokes ahead of the nearest competitor ? // Bruno came up and walked alongside to encourage me . " You 're in great shape , " he said . " A good approach , and you 've got a chance at a birdie . With your handicap stroke , that 'll start us off great  --  two under par . " // I studied the next shot with care , I took out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but as I stood over the ball , bringing back the club , my old terror of being an unwieldy machine swept over me , and I shanked the shot , dumping it into a trap off to one side of the green . The ball had skidded off almost at a diagonal . The silence was absolute until I broke it with a strained cry , as if after the first two superb shots the absurdity of the third was unbelievable  --  like two graceful steps from a ballerina , and then a splay-legged pratfall , a thump and a high squawk of dismay . // I stalked miserably into the trap , and  --  not catching enough sand with my wedge  --  I lifted the ball into a grove of pines on the other side of the green . I was still about 40 yards away , just the distance I 'd been two strokes back . The ball was stymied in the pines , and it took me two more strokes to get out . // " Pick it up , " Bruno called petulantly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hole . We had started off the tournament by losing one stroke to par on the easiest hole on the peninsula . // " I 'm awful sorry , " I said to Bruno . // " I told your caddie to stick that pitching wedge in the bag and leave it there , " he said . " You had a clear line . You should 've rolled it up there with a four-or a five-iron  --  a pitch-and-run shot . " He shook his head . // " I 'm not so hot on those , " I said . " I 've always felt comfortable with that wedge . " // " We 'll get going , " he said more cheerfully . " Hell , we 've got 53 holes to go . " // I never quite got over that first hole . " It is not a crime to play a bad shot , " Bernard Darwin , the great English golf writer , once wrote . " A player may yet be a good husband and a good father and a true Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time Darwin seemed to me to be begging the issue . // LAME , HALT AND ... // We ended the first day 's play discouraged . Bruno 's score was 77 , and our team score of 74 was 14 strokes behind the leaders . I was unnerved by my own game . It was my hope that a professional , perhaps a player considered a great " teaching pro " by his fellows and one to whom they go for advice ( Gardner Dickinson is one of these , I was told ) would take a glance at my swing and say , " Well now , look here , you 've got to bring the left hand around jes ' a mite , and maybe you got to open up your stance some . Try that . " And then down on the practice tee I would do what had been suggested . I would move the left hand around and open the stance , and the ball would take off into the distance with an entire quality and verve about it that had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pros have enough to worry about , and their advice to their amateurs is usually limited to the choice of a club , or often , if requested , they will read the green for their partner . Bruno rarely had anything to say . He cared terribly , but very often he looked away as I addressed the ball , turning his body and staring moodily off into the pines . I was reminded of Ben Hogan 's caddie at Carnoustie when Hogan won the British Open . The caddie had the disconcerting habit of dropping his head in his hands just as Hogan was about to putt . It was not the most assuring of reactions . // The only memorable suggestion on my play came not from a professional but from Andy Williams , the singer . I was at a dinner table with him in the Del Monte Lodge the evening after the first round , and he turned to me and suggested that one 's putting might be improved by executing the stroke , assuming that it was a short putt , with one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . // " You hit the putt with the eyes closed , " Williams said . " What you do is look at the ball , and then at the cup , concentrating on both , so that when you close your eyes the scene is still right there in your mind  --  like when you look at a bright light bulb and close your eyes , the light 's still there , just the outline of it , right ? " // " Sure . " // " Well , then you putt , " Williams said . " The beauty of it is that if you putt with your eyes closed , there are no distractions , no newspapers blowing to complicate things , no sudden movement in the gallery , and you do n't have the idea that your caddie is scowling at you . The trouble with putting with your eyes open is that there is too much to notice , too much for the mind to grasp . With the eyes closed , all the extraneous matter is wiped out , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eye are the essentials  --  the ball and the cup . " // " Do you actually do this ? " I asked , fascinated . " Are you seriously telling me that yon putt with your eyes closed ? " // He looked at me . " You must be mad , " he said . " Who 'd have enough courage to close his eyes ? Or tell anyone else about it if he did ? Can you imagine what would happen if such a thing got around the country club , and just as you were about to putt some practical joker bent down and snatched the ball away , so that with the mind just tight with concentration you move the putter for that little putt and hit nothing , nothing at all ? Can you imagine what that would do to the sanity of a golfer ? " // " Well , that 's a thought , " I said . // I tried it , though , out on the practice putting green in front of the lodge , just to make sure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abe about it . He was scornful . " I got enough troubles , " he said , " to be worrying about leading some golfer around the course who keeps his eyes closed . " // " It 's just for putting . " // " Well , " said Abe . " It might get to be a habit . " He shook his head and refused to talk about it further . " Why do n't you go and get yourself some good advice so that we can get ourselves moving in this tournament ? " // THE RAGE OF BRUNO // Perhaps I had Abe 's exhortations in mind on the 4th at Cypress Point where , with my eyes open , I made one of my best shots of the Crosby , a 40-foot putt . I let off a whoop , and everybody stood around grinning . But Bruno missed his putt , and suddenly his temper left him ; it just sidled off , and the rage came in and settled . He putted out with dispatch , handed the club to his caddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the next tee , striding along , he suddenly swerved off the path into the woods . He disappeared . We could hear him moving through the underbrush . Then we heard an odd bopping sound . // Someone looked and said , " My God , he 's in there beating his driver against a stump ! " // I peered around a tree to look , and it was true . I saw him in there , a tall figure with his golf hat a startling white in the dark shadows of the eucalyptus forest , flailing away , the club swinging in the air like a willow switch and then the echoing bop as it hit , as if he were trying to drive the stump and its network of roots down into the earth . // We stood around on the path uneasily , wearing the cowlike expression of children among whom one has collapsed into tears . The bopping continued . The caddies moved restlessly , the irons clinking in the golf bags . I wondered vaguely if I should wander into the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as he toiled at the stump , and there would be an easy , calming phrase to say : " Anything I can do to help , Bob ? " I was , after all , his partner . // The clubbing stopped abruptly . After a while we heard Bruno 's footsteps again . He came out on the path . He still held the driver , its shaft down near the club head bent in a grotesque curve . He saw us staring at him . He seemed aghast . He was purged and controlled again , but he did n't know how to put it right with us . His caddie , who was a florid-faced youngster , very stout , not long out of school , looked petrified . " Bob ... er ... ah , " he mumbled . " You want me to try to straighten that club ? " // " I 'll have to use the three-wood , " Bruno said . He turned the driver in his hand and stared at it miserably . " This thing 's done with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this is the one I liked . " // We started along for the tee . " I 'm sorry , everybody , " he said . " My game is just so damn terrible . " // The compassion for him among the rest of us was immense . On the tee our team had the honor due to my great putt that had given Bruno and me a birdie on the hole , the exhilaration of which still ticked in me despite the drama in the forest . // " We 're on our way , Bob , " I called . // Bruno stepped up first . Due to the loft of the three-wood , his drive , despite teeing the ball down low , soared up until the ball almost lost itself against the sky before beginning its downward flight , which was nearly vertical from the apex and was completely so as it hit the fairway , so that the ball bounced straight up and came to rest , it seemed to us watching from the tee , not more than a foot or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious loss of yardage due to the trajectory of the ball , but one would not have known this from the chorus of approbation that rose from our little group . // " Sweet shot , Bob ! " // " Bob , you really popped it ! " // " Great poke , Bob ! " // Bruno knew better , and he slumped down on the bench by the side of the tee and stared between his feet . // I then stepped up to the ball , meaning to do my best for him , my concern for him really quite palpable in some corner of my mind , and after a quick check down the alley of pines that opened up into the wide fairway beyond I looked sharply at the Titleist 1 on its tee and then drove it 50 yards in a low , hard trajectory into one of the pines just at the end of the alley . It hit with a bopping sound , and then another as it ricocheted through the quiet pine groves , and I was struck suddenly that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whacking at the stump with his driver  --  perhaps more hollow and a bit sharper , but about the same  --  so that sitting on the bench , his head down ( I 'm certain that he never looked up to see me hit my drive ) , he heard once again the mournful sound of his own rage , an audible reflection of his despairing moments back up the path . // Then he heard me calling out cheerily , more concerned for his melancholy than my own : " Sorry , Bob , I 'm truly sorry . But you 'll pull us through . " // He rose off the bench . He said tightly : " It 's all right . It 's all right . " // When our foursome moved off the tee , Bruno 's caddie took the bent driver and matter-of-factly worked the woolen cover with the red pompon down over the club head and the curved shaft and set the club back in the bag . The club was bent at its end in a curve so pronounced that it seemed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crook . I was surprised Bruno did n't fling it away somewhere , into the sea perhaps on the ocean holes , but it stayed the day with us , palpable evidence , like a car with its hood askew , reminding us of the crisis in the woods . // PROFESSIONAL PATOIS // After the second day 's round it was evident that the Bruno-Plimpton team was not going to make the cut . On the third day we would be required to pick up almost a stroke a hole to continue as a team for the fourth and final day . On his individual score , Bruno 's average was such that he would have to struggle to make the cut . I left him working on his putting in the semidarkness and went into the lodge . Dave Marr , the former PGA champion , saw me wandering by , and he called out cheerfully to me , " They tell me you were doing a lot of chilly-dipping out there today . " // Not knowing what the term meant , it did not seem an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " Well ... ah . " // " You were hitting some shots out there that were n't making any noise " Marr said . // It seemed safe to say , " That 's so , " so I did . // " You had those divots coming up and just curling over the ball . " // " That 's right , " I said , surer of myself . " Absolutely . " // We went down to the bar and joined some of the other golfers . I asked about " chilly-dipping , " just to be certain , and they said it meant a flub , the same as not putting any " noise " on the ball . They began talking about golf expressions , and how they had changed through the years . // In the present-day idiom a player with a bad round , such as the one I 'd had , was described as having " crashed and burned . " He would complain that his game had been troubled by " snipes " or " blue darters " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit too many shots into the " tall and uncut , " " the asparagus , " " the cabbage , " " the zucchini , " " the lettuce " or " Marlboro Country "  --  all expressions for the rough . If he was n't in the rough , he was in the sand traps , which were referred to as " cat boxes , " " silicone , " " on the beach " or in the " bogey dust " Actually , " bogey dust " could be used for any shot out of the fairway , as in , " Man , I never saw that shot , but she sure blew up the bogey dust . " Another variation was : " Baby , that duck hook 's moving those field mice for real . " // As for expressions describing shots well hit , they had changed considerably . A few years ago a professional golfer would say , " I was hitting it a ton today . " Now he says : " The Fat Man Nicklaus really shot the lights out today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong shot hit by his partner , " Man , you put some hurtin ' on that one . " Or perhaps , " Partner , you really got some swift on that shot . " A long , low drive would be " a frozen rope , " and a long putt successfully sunk is referred to as a " field goal " or a " gobbler " or a " snake , " as in " on the 12th I got me a snake . " A short putt is a " knee-knocker " and would be stroked from an area called " the throw-up zone . " A fine approach shot would be described by a pro as having been knocked " stony , " or perhaps his partner would say , " Man , you hit that one adjacent . " A great shot , if it is hit at the right time , is always a " career shot . " // Such golfing expressions are often shifted to suit everyday observations . For example , sipping at his beer , a golfer might say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unraked sand trap . " // Or perhaps , which was the ultimate in disparagement , " She 's 18 off the reds , " using the term for a handicap of 18 off the women 's tees to indicate their low opinion . // " She 's two off the blues , " would suggest a girl ranked very high in the general estimation . // The handicap system could be applied to anything . A golfer , looking out at the weather in the morning , could call back over his shoulder and indicate its state to a nicety  --  from " scratch off the blues " to " 18 off the reds , " this last meaning , very likely , a blizzard , or that the golfer was suffering a terrible hangover and had a bad day to face . // Some of the transitions were involved and took some work to understand . For example , seeing a girl of questionable reputation leaning against the bar , a golfer would say , " George , see that bird . Well , you would n't say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would you ? " // I leaned forward , puzzled . " I do n't get it . " // " What happens if your right hand comes in with too much power ? What do you call a person who has that problem ? " // " A slice , " I said , thinking about it . " A slicer. " // " So ? " // " Oh , yes , " I 'd say , looking at the girl , " that 's pretty damn clever . " And they all sat back , pleased , sipping at their beer . // Nicknames ? I asked . I supposed these must be colorful , considering the lively patois of the game . The players looked at each other . Well , there were the familiar ones . Mike Souchak , he was called " Smokey the Bear , " for looking like the original article . Ken Venturi was known as " Silks , " though no one was quite sure why . Usually a player who wore fancy golfing trousers of a special material was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Venturi . Many of the names came with the player onto the tour . Charles Sifford had always been " The Horse , " Harold Kneece " The Catfish , " Gene Littler " The Machine , " Paul Harney " Boston Blackie . " Kermit Zarley , for his somewhat extraterrestrial name , was called " The Pro from the Moon . " Lionel Hebert , the Louisianian , was known as " Lionel from Montreal " from the tag line of a Cajun song he sang . Gardner Dickinson , for being Ben ( The Hawk ) Hogan 's imitator , with an identical golf style and for affecting the same clothes , in particular the famous white cloth cap , was called " The Chicken Hawk , " though never within his hearing . If golfers sitting around a cocktail table caught Dickinson in a cough , or even clearing his throat , they would say to each other behind half-cupped hands , " Oh-oh , Ben 's come down with a bad cold , sure enough . " // One of the best nicknames ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . " Deadman " they called him , a name not derived from his personal appearance , but from caddies , who hung it on him for his habit of calling out rapidly after a poor shot , " Man , I 'm dead , I 'm dead , I 'm dead over there , just dead over there , just dead . " // " You have a name yet ? " they asked me. // " Not yet , " I said , thinking back on the calamities of the day . " First , I got to put some noise on my shots , " I said , trying out the phrase . " Some swift . " // " Yes , you try that , " they said earnestly .
