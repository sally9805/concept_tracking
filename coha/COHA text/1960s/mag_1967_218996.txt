TOO STRONG FOR FANTASY by Marcia Davenport . 483 pages . Scribner. $8.95 . <P> What is left out in an autobiography is usually what the reader hoped to find . Novelist Marcia Davenport ( The Valley of Decision ) gives fair warning that , at 64 , she is old-fashioned enough to believe in a " suitable reticence , " and strong-minded enough to keep back what she thinks is her business alone . She carries the stance a bit too far . Though she knows that the main attractions of her story are the famous men and women in her life , she tells about them with the righteousness and much of the trivia that precede the chicken a la king at a librarians ' luncheon . <P> Marcia 's mother was the fine soprano , Alma Gluck , a Rumanian immigrant who went almost literally overnight from humming in the kitchen to success at the Metropolitan Opera . Marcia 's father is swiftly disposed of in the book . Her stepfather , Violinist Efrem Zimbalist , is seen simply as an amiable husband and parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toscanini , her lifelong friend and hero , comes off somewhat better , but his famous tantrums at rehearsals and his personal crotchets add little to one 's appreciation of his genius as a conductor . <P> Add marriage to onetime FORTUNE Editor Russell Davenport , a staff job on the young and heady New Yorker , a close friendship with Wendell Willkie and a deep and tragic one with Czechoslovakia 's Jan Masaryk . Add , for good measure , her editor at Scribner , Maxwell Perkins , and an entire gallery of people who were constantly in the public eye , and it is hard to imagine that she experienced a dull moment . Almost certainly no other American of Jewish descent sat , feet hanging out the window of the Foreign Office building in Berlin , facing Hitler and Hindenburg across the street as the old marshal handed Germany over to his successor . And there can not be too many people who ever had Toscanini drop in and play passages from Lohengrin on the piano as he sang in his cracked voice . <P> But not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart begin to beat in her book . When the Communists took over Czechoslovakia in 1948 , she saw both Prague , the city she loved best in the world , and the man who meant the most to her become sacrifices to forces she despised . After World War II , she had taken a flat in Prague where she hoped to live the rest of her life . While he was Foreign Minister , she saw Masaryk almost daily until his death ( she is convinced that he was murdered by the Communists ) . Yet even here the book , as it does throughout , consists of moments walled in by the commonplace . Those who know enough about her time and the people she describes can fill in some details for themselves as they go along . For the others , it is plainly a book that Mrs. Davenport felt she had to write even if she kept the best of it to herself .
