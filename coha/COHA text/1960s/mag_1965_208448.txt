Until now , no " progressive " ( one-party ) people 's democracy has been complete without a ) periodic elections in which 99.44% of the electorate enthusiastically vote in favor of a single list of candidates* and b ) a parliament consisting of party leaders and other carefully selected citizens who can be depended on to debate , then dutifully approve , the legislation put before it by the regime . Ghana 's Kwame Nkrumah , however , is an innovator ; he has finally found a way to get the parliament without the election . <P> Early this year , Nkrumah arranged to have 99.9% of the electorate approve a one-party constitution , and he dissolved Parliament elected before Ghana gained independence eight years ago . His Convention People 's Party then nominated 198 illustrious candi dates ( including U.N . Delegate Alex Quaison-Sackey and Margaret Martei , secretary of the Women 's Council ) , and last week Nkrumah simply declared them all elected-for lack of opposition . Explained Spark , the party weekly : " This will be an object lesson to all Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effectively under a one-party state . " <P> <P> * Example : In Poland last week , 460 members of Parliament were chosen from a list ( National Unity Front ) with 616 names in all , and voters were permitted to cross out names of candidates they did not like . First Party Secretary Wladyslaw Gomulka was re-elected by 99.3% of the vote in his constituency , while Premier Jozef Cyrankiewicz scored a mere 94.4%.
