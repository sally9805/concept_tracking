On July 26 , 1953 , a ragtag band of 160 Cubans tried to trigger an uprising against Dictator Fulgencio Batista by attacking Santiago de Cuba 's Moncada Army barracks . The chancy venture was squashed , and half of the partisans were killed . Among those imprisoned was 25-year-old Fidel Castro , a lawyer turned revolutionist , who drew a 15-year sentence . In an act more merciful than wise , Batista granted Castro amnesty after only two years . In 1956 , after a brief Mexican exile , Fidel was back in Cuba with another guerrilla band ; but this time he was not to be caught . Two years later , he ruled Cuba . <P> Cuba took a holiday last week to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Moncada barracks raid . Among the observers at the festivities was TIME Correspondent Richard Duncan , who toured Castro 's island fiefdom to see how Cuba has changed in the decade since Fidel took control . His report : <P> To the dismay of Cuba 's city dwellers , the Castro revolution has been strictly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national product is reinvested in the earth to the planned detriment of the city dweller . As a result , more than half of the 50,000 Cubans fleeing annually are Habaneros . They have taken with them most of the liveliness that once made Havana the " Paris of the Caribbean . " <P> <P> After ten years of decay , its shoreline is a sweep of greying yellow buildings . A few once posh hotels and restaurants remain open , but the epitaphs to their elegance and cuisine are written on the walls . " Under the revolutionary offensive , this establishment belongs to the people , " reads a sign in a once privately owned shop . Loudspeakers shatter the soft night air , calling the faithful to a " solidarity with North Viet Nam " rally , while just a block away at Monseigneur Restaurant ( steak : $15 ) , harassed waiters try to evoke the old days by wrapping label-less bottles of beer in napkins . Transportation is largely by bus . Gasoline rationing has virtually emptied the streets of cars , except those rusting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the Havana Libre , formerly the Hilton Hotel , the clientele still is cosmopolitan , but the tone has changed . Chunky Russian technicians jostle wispy North Koreans in the elevator . In the lobby , Havana women , necklines plunging down their backs in the style of a decade ago , click across the marble floors to the tune of Heroic Guerrilla played on the p.a. system . <P> Castro 's indifference to the city dwellers is understandable . Cuba 's greatest need is for more food . Rationing permits only eight ounces of beef per person each month , only three pounds of rice . In Havana people wait in line for hours at restaurants and markets to supplement their meager rations . " Lines are a social institution now , " explains a Vedado woman . " They are also the only way to get anything . "
