The Senate last week blasted clear of its great reapportionment logjam . After six weeks of didactic debate , fulminating filibuster and mule-headed obstinacy on all sides , a quorum of weary Senators finally compromised , 44-38 , on a " sense of Congress " resolution : federal courts are requested to grant a breathing spell to states reapportioning their legislative districts . In the soft est of language , the resolution asks that courts give the states at least one legislative session , plus an additional 30 days , to meet the Supreme Court 's one-man-one-vote requirements . But the " sense of Congress " really makes very little sense : there is no legal machinery that can compel the federal courts to take cognizance of the resolution . It is about as binding as a rubber band . <P> With logjam broken , the Senate speedily turned to remaining business . Before the week was out it had : <P> &gt;Approved , 45-16 , the $3.3 billion foreign aid bill-$216 million less than President Johnson originally asked-which now goes to a Senate-House conference . There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other raising interest rates on development loans , may give the bill further trouble . <P> &gt; Adopted , 54-11 , and sent to the White House , a Senate-House conference report on the $4 billion Food for Peace program . The bill stipulates that the U.S. may not sell farm surpluses to Yugoslavia and Poland unless they are paid for in U.S. dollars . The President opposes that restriction , but a veto is unlikely . <P> &gt;Quickened Lyndon 's heart by passing , 45-13 , the $1 billion " New Hope " plan for the impoverished Appalachia region , last of the President 's major anti-poverty schemes . The bill now goes to the House , where a close vote is expected .
