Here &; There <P> Sir : I have come to rely upon TIME as a lucid and reasonably objective commentary on the events that are taking place in this world of ours . I find , however , that your recent commentary on the war and the Tet offensive March 1 is blatant alarmism , shrill with Cassandra 's cry and , from my vantage point at least , unsupportable in fact . This is painfully evident to anyone serving here . Your reporting of the impact of the recent offensive on the war , the government , and the economy , is exaggerated and misleading . <P> ROBERT L. SHAW Major , U.S.A. A.P.O. , San Francisco <P> Sir : Thank you for a glimpse into the truth of the Viet Nam war . It is disgusting to read nothing but optimistic foolishness that leads one to think that the war can be won in a few weeks . It is time we realize that this war will not be won in a few weeks or a few years , and that it is probably not worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves on the back and start kicking some tails . <P> JAMES T. AUTEN Madison , Wis . <P> <P> Stop the Press <P> Sir : Bravo for the honesty and courage evidenced by Columnist Howard K. Smith March 1 . It is about time that the whole journalistic profession stood back and took a long look at what they have done to our nation . One searches daily , in vain , through the mass of publications and news broadcasts for one word that would reassure the common man that all the colored people are not Stokely Carmichaels , that all our youth are not chick-en-livered draft dodgers , that not all the people have lost faith in our President and in his honest efforts to do the best job he can under most difficult circumstances , that some of us are still proud to be Americans , living in a working democracy and ready and willing to do what we can to help anyone else achieve a like state . <P> MRS . R. E. WICKHAM Los Angeles <P> Sir : I do n't think I have ever before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the need to write about it . But I am so moved by his feeling about the American press . Sitting out back here gives me a perspective I did n't have when I was in the midst of it . I am convinced that the metropolitan editors and byliners are snobs , fearful that if they do n't join the prevailing intellectual line they will be considered " mere reporters . " What happened to the guys who used to stick pins into pomposity ? <P> WILFRED WEISS Publisher <P> The Winchendon Courier Winchendon , Mass . <P> <P> Sir : As a mother with an almost 18-year-old son who will this fall begin his college career in the U.S. with no fear of the draft awaiting him because of his British passport , I can endorse every word of Britain 's Bernard Levin , columnist for the Daily Mail March 1 . My heart goes out with gratitude to those American families whose sons are holding back the Red tide in Southeast Asia-and with shame for the paltry attitude taken by many in Britain and the Western world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own hour of need . <P> CORALIE POWELL Somerset , Bermuda <P> As He Likes It ? <P>
