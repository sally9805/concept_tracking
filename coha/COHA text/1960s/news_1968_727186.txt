txt Washington , June 19 - Fifty thousand Americans converged on Washington today in a mass protest against the nation 's treatment of its poor . They heard the Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy , president of tho Southern Christian Leadership conference , tell the Solidarity day group : " I do n't care whether the department of the interior gives us a permit to stay on In Resurrection City . . . intend to stay here until justice rolls out of the halls of Congress . " The permit for the group to stay in the shantytown campsite near , the Lincoln memorial expires Sunday . In 80-degree heat under overcast skies , they retraced the route from the Washington monument to the Lincoln memorial where 200,000 people marched five years ago behind the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . The signs they carried bespoke their demands : " 1 have a dream  --  one America " ? . " End hunger in America " . . " Jobs or income for all Ameri , cans . " Oppose Viet War But the main speakers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war in Viet Nam , calling for a national outpouring of sentiment to force American pull-out . The emotional high point ol the afternoon was reached as Mrs. Marlin Luther King Jr. , wife of the slain Negro leader , called for a massive amalgamation of " woman power " to force withdrawal from Viet Nam and fulfill her husband 's dream of a nation free of poverty and racial strife . Mrs. King referred often to her husband 's " I have a dream " speech in 1963 that galvanized the civil rights movement , and she said about the war that " if we do not stop this madness , we will certainly destroy ourselves and the whole world . " Looks to Children " I have a dream , " she quoted him , " that my four little chi will one day live in a no-lion where they will not he judged by the color ' of their skin but by the content of their character . " She also read a wire from Mrs , Ethel Kennedy , widow ol Sen. Robert F. Kennedy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangible action our country takes now to implement the programs he and my husband cared about so deeply . " Most speakers restricted their remarks to the need for ? congressional action to broaden aid to the poor . This is the focal point of the six-week-old poor people 's campaign that King conceived and which resulted in Resurrection City , the shantytown campsite near the Lin-coin memorial . The Rev. Mr. Abernathy , who succeeded King as president of the S. C. L. C. declared that the " unjust , immoral , and tragic " escalation of the Viet Nam war had started the disintegration of the " coalition of conscience " which began with the 1963 march led by King . " The promise of a great society was burned to ashes by the napalm in Viet Nam and we watched the Johnson administration perform as the unwitting midwife at the birth of the sick society , " he said . Claims Concessions Won And he said that today 's demonstration marked not the end but the beginning of a permanent major effort to keep pressure on Congress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the current campaign-the last activity planned by Dr. King before he was slain in April - already h a d succeeded in winning concessions for jobs , food , education , housing , and health for the poor . He lashed out at rural southerners in Congress who , he said , " are enslaved to the past " and who " stifle our nation 's progress and against whom we must mobilize our entire nation . " The Rev. Mr. Abernathy named Democratic Senators James Eastland of Mississippi , Allen Ellender of Louisiana , Richard Russell of Georgia , Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia , mid , Rep , Wilbur Mills W. , Ark. as targets . Many other national leaders spoke out for what Walter Reuther , president of the United Auto Workers union , called " a great crusade to awaken the conscience of America , to get the Congress off dead center , and to move America forward In a total war to abolish human poverty in a land of plenty . " They and the Rev. Mr. Abernathy , spoke also of the Mexican-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appalachian white . In the words of Roy Wilkins , executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , they demanded " a reordering of the priorities in the incredibly fabulous budget of our nation , " Touch on Violence Another theme that ran thru all the speeches was that the nation is on the verge of a massive outpouring of violence such as it has never seen , and that today 's march may be the last nonviolent one . Whitney M. Young Jr. , executive director of the National Urban league , said that the prophets of doom , the bitter and disillusioned , and the peddlers of hate " are waiting in the wings to see if we fail ... " to reap the whirlwind of America 's indifference . " The remarks of the speakers were echoed to a large extent by Chicagoans who came to Washington for today 's rally , Marcher from Austin Miss Sandra Dufresman , 22 , a white secretary who lives in the Austin area , said she hoped the rally would " start people to thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped on . " And Mrs. Margaret L. King of 9063 S. Emerald ay. , said she came today in the hope that her grandchildren would not grow up in an atmosphere of segregation and need .
