txt The nation 's restaurant and night-club operators , already in a stew over sagging revenues and profit margins , are boiling mad about a couple of propositions cooked uo in Washington . Restaurant men contend serious threats to their industry are posed by President Kennedy 's recommendation to restrict tax deductions for business expenses , and by the urging of some Congressmen that Federal minimum wage legislation be extended to 2 1 million restaurant workers The night club segment of the industry perhaps would be affected even to a larger degree by the proposed tax overhaul , which includes a suggestion by the President that the cost of business entertainment be disallowed as a deduction . " This is a sick business , " says one restaurant owner , " and this change in the rules on expense account spending would nearly kill off the luxury restaurants . And an extension of minimum wage coverage to restaurant workers would finish us all . " Although this view no doubt is exaggerated to get across the restaurant owner 's genuine alarm , nearly everyone connected with the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that business remains slow , even though other segments of the economy appear to be picking up from their recession lows Restaurant men agree , too , that passage of the President 's tax proposal or of the minimum wage coverage would be a staggering blow . Status of Rill Actually , there is no chance that minimum wage legislation will be extended to the restaurant industry immediately . On Wednesday , the House and Senate passed a bill that will raise the present hourly minimum wage and extend its coverage to 3.6 million more workers , though not to restaurant employees However , the measure does carry an amendment originally proposed in the Senate by New York 's Jacob K. Javits which requires the Secretary of Labor to report to the 1962 session of Congress his recommendations on further extending coverage to restaurant ( as well as agricultural ) workers . Restaurant labor costs are estimated to run about one-third of sales The more immediate threat to the industry , restaurant men say , is the Administration plan to overhaul the tax laws . This plan was described to Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling for elimination of all deductions for customer entertainment , including the purchase of food and beverages where the main purpose is to create good will , the Kennedy plan would impose a $30 limit on deductions claimed for a man 's food and lodging on business trips away from home and calls for a daily limit of $4 to $7 a person on deductions for food and beverages purchased at business meetings or discussions The Treasury has explained that the latter provision would cover " a meal in a restaurant " where business matters are discussed An executive of one plush Manhattan restaurant with a big expense account trade believes such tax changes would " just about ruin the business of our and other big-check operations . " Another Manhattan restaurateur calls the President 's proposal " sheer madness , " and adds : " Here 's a business that 's hurting because of the recession and the President does his best to kill off an important segment of our trade . " " A Bitter Effect " Ed Risman , general manager of the Latin Quarter , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same attitude " Right now we are in a recession , " Mr. Risman says , " and these restrictions on business expenses would only retard our recovery . This is bound to have a bitter effect on our business . " Mr. Risman believes entertainment has come to be " a valid part of merchandising . " Adds he ? " When a businessman brings a customer or a client in to close a deal he has to be lavish After all , he ca n't take the customer to a night club and tell him to limit himself to a couple of sandwiches " On the other hand , some businessmen , though probably not many restaurateurs , agree with the position expressed by President Kennedy in his tax message of April 21 . " In I ecent years , " the President said , " widespread abuses have developed through the use of the epense account Too many firms and individuals have devised means of deducting too many personal living expenses and busineas expenses , thereby charging a large part of their cost to the Federal Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tax deductions for business expenses , they will not mean an end to such expenditures over the deductible limits Many businessmen probably will choose to continue entertaining big customers . absoi bing the cost as a necessary outlay for obtaining sales Despite the restaurant industry 's concern with the tax laws , only the expensive night clubs and luxury restaurants  --  a ' Small segment of the industry  --  are likely to be affected much by any changes . However , the industry 's troubles go well beyond the tax laws . A sensitive barometer of economic conditions , the restaurant business tends to slack off early in a recession and is usually one of the last business areas to snap back Comments from around the country indicate this clearly applies to the 1960-1961 economic slump " Itusiness Is Terrible " " Our business is tei i ible ' asses is Mt Jules Van Cleave , lane of the owner of Alfred 's Restaurant in South Gate .

DalndlIng Profits Although total restaurant volume had been climbing gradually in recent years until the present recession , profits have been on the wane since 1950 What is behind this unfavorable trend ? For one thing , according to the National Restaurant Association , earnings averaged about 5 6 , - of sales in 1960 , and now are about 3 Profit margins have declined as costs have gone up more steeply than sales . Moreover , the greater over-all restaurant volume has been spread among a growing number of eating places Around30.000 new restaurants have come on the scene in each year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27.000 eating establishments have disappeared every year over the same period  --  due to owner retirement , bankruptcy , death or dissatisfaction with dwindling profits . Dun and Bradstreet , a business reporting service , says that in January and February of this year restaurant failures were up 17% from the first two months of 1960. with the dollar liabilities of the businesses that failed up 60% . On balance , however , the number of restaurants continues to rive . The Restaurant Man , a trade publication , says that " it is generally agreed there are too many restaurants , with the number growing more rapidly than the number of customers " Some restaurant men believe that one effect of the mass exodus flora cities to the suburbs in their areas has been a decline In eating nut ; this , in part , has offset the potential larger volume created by population gains One restaurant man explains the predicament this way ? " The suburban spots get some of the business we lose when people move farther away from a city , but they do n't get all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trade is made up of families . " It 's also believed by restaurant men that the diet drink fad has hurt business . They note that sales of the low-calorie compounds are running about 3100 million a year ; it seems logical . they /Oil , that dieters eat out less and ninhe roarer customers when they do . tlrimth In Chiles Another problem Is mentioned by stocky , balding Vincent Sudi , Jr. , proprietor of Sardi 's East , which , along with the original Sardi 's mow called Sardi 's West ) , ate well known to New York theater-goers . " The luncheon clubs for business esectith es are becoming more and more popular and take away many potential noon costumers , " he says . It Is estimated that every day 22.000 businessmen in New York City lunch at a private club , and a growing number of new office buildings are including membet s-only restaurants , often on their top floors In the face of all this .

As Donald Greenway , executive vice president of the National Restaurant Association , puts it . " Set profit for many restaurants Is no mole than 1% to 2.5% . The margin for management error in the restaurant business Is very small . " To combat the various problems besetting their industry , many restaurant men are struggling to diversify into more profitable ventures , Take-out Business Some eating establishments , for instance , are bidding for more take-out business  --  a new source of volume that requires only a modest investment for paper cups . plates and containers .
