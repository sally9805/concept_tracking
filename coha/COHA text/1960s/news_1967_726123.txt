Daley and other leaders attended a two-hour summit conference here late today on Chicago and Cook county 's financial needs . The mayor will return to Springfield tomorrow for another such meeting of Chicago , Cook county , and state leaders in Gov . Kerner 's office . Richard B. Ogilvie , Republican president of the Cook county board , displayed teamwork with G. 0 . P. legislative leaders at today 's session . He said he will not ask them to double the city sales tax quickly in order to win Democratic help for county emergency aid bills . Daley is seeking the increase . Kerner Silent on Tax Kerner declined a G. 0 . P. invitation to say tonight that he will not try to boost the 31t-cent state sates tax later in the 1967 session . However , Republican legislative leaders said an increase in the city sales tax can not be considered intelligently without knowledge of Kerner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Russell Arrington . House Majority Leader William E. Pollack , and House Speaker Ralph T. Smith . Daley used baseball terminology when he was asked what happened at today 's conference . " We 've got a man on first . " he replied . " All we need is a bunt to get him around . " Daley Is Optimistic He was asked whether he was optimistic about final results of the deadlock here . " I 'm always optimistic , " Daley said . " The White Sox and Cubs will win the championships . " In contrast , Ogilvie told newsmen he is " not particularly optimistic " and certainly can not predict pennants for both the Cubs and White Sox . " It was not a success , " Arrington said of the conference , but he would not call it a failure . Democrats Seek Trade Democrats demanded that Republicans assure passage of the city tax package by Feb. 23 if the Democrats joined in passing Ogilvie bills to provide Cook county with funds . Ogilvie seeks to divert 15 million dollars from existing gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1967 county budget . He also wants a nonreferendum 10-million-dollar bond issue for improvements in Co u n t y hospital , for better police radio equipment , and for voting machines . Today 's session was called at his request to discuss these bills . Bill Asks CTA Aid A new subject for the bargaining table developed today - a bill introduced in the House to get 7.3 million dollars in state appropriations for the Chicago transit authority . Years of battling preceded the first state subsidy of this type , approved at the 1965 session . " I 'm aware of it . " Smith said when asked about the crA bill . The Daley proposal will be presented to Republican legislators for discussion tomorrow . G. 0 . P. senators will get it in a closed-door caucus in the morning . House Republicans will take it up in caucus at 1 p. m . Daley , Kerner , and the others are to hold their second conference at 2:30 p. m . Daley , dominant Democratic leader in Illinois , denied that a " cold deal " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation means no county bills will be passed unless the city bills are passed by Feb. 23 , Daley said : " No , it does n't mean that at Arrington disagreed . He told reporters after they left Daley that this situation prevails : " The emergency county legislation is to be killed unless the city bills are passed by Feb. 23 . " " There 's no question but that it is an ultimatum , " the G. 0 . P. leader said . Arrington told THE TRIBUNE that Kerner " specifically said he could not say whether he will elevate the state sales tax or broaden the retail tax to other occupations either or both . " THE TRIBUNE reported exclusively Feb. 7 that top leaders show indications of trying to raise more than 500 million dollars in fresh state revenue for the next two years by extending the occupation tax ? popularly known now as the sales tax ? to many other occupations including doctors , dentists , lawyers , beauty operators , barbers and others . Half Cent Inadequate A half-cent boost in the 31-cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the demands of the higher education commission a n d school problem commission . The unofficially-proposed extension of the occupation tax far beyond the retailers would bring in a great deal more for the state . Presumably it would be applied also to give a half-cent on each dollar to more than 1,200 municipalities . This could provide new revenue for cities in somewhat the same category as the increase proposed by Daley in the retail occupation tax . Seek New Taxes Daley and executives of many other cities in Illinois want the legislature to authorize taxes on cigarets , liquor , wine , beer , and hotel and motel rooms to boost their finances without further recourse to the real estate tax . Arrington said that the Democratic position is threatening but will not be taken by the G. 0 . P. as reason for retaliation . Speaker Smith told newsmen that Republicans realize the state needs some assistance but said that the 1967 session began only last month and this is not the right time in the session for such crucial decisions .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
