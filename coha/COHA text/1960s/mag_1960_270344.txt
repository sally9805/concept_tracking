When Paul Riley , 15. first came upon the scene during one of his evening rambles about the London suburb of Richmond , the youngster was entranced . There was a dark lane leading through weathered buildings to the Thames . Paul sketched it a few times , finally painted it when the streets were wet and the sky leaden . At Easter , when his father , an art teacher , was packing up some of his own canvases for the annual Summer Show at the Royal Academy of Art in London , he suggested that Paul send in something too , and Paul chose Water Lane , Richmond . " Have a bash. " his father said . " You 've got to get used to disappointments . " <P> A quiet boy who favors jeans and turtleneck sweaters , Paul has been studying art with his father for the last four years , but the old man 's suggestion at first seemed absolutely balmy . Though the lackluster Summer Show gets an annual trouncing from London 's critics , it does represent the Academy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other painters from all over Britain . But last week , when the show opened with appropriate pomp , it was Paul and not his father who was there as an honored guest . <P> In the 190 years since the first Summer Show in Sir Joshua Reynolds ' day , only two younger artists had ever been shown at the Academy . One was Joan Floyd of Bristol , who had a painting hung in 1928 when she was 14 , but gave up her career for marriage . The other was Master ( later Sir ) Edwin Landseer , whose Portrait of a Mule and Portrait of a Pointer Bitch and Puppy created a sensation in 1915 when Landseer was only 13.
