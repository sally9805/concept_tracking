WE are sorry that President Cleveland has departed in his first message from his practice of making his state papers short , because in documents of this sort what is gained in extension is lost in intension , as the logicians say . We can do little more this week than make a brief summary of the message , though it is full of points which invite comment . The President begins by announcing friendly relations with all foreign governments ; mentions the refusal of satisfaction to the Argentine Government for an old dispute of 1831 ; declares that the reasons given for the refusal of the Austrian Government to receive Mr. Keiley were such as could not be acquiesced in , intimating that one of them was Mrs. Keiley 's being a Jewess , and states that his place has not been filled ; describes the revolutionary outbreak at Panama last spring ; announces that the claim of the Colombian Government to close ports held by the insurgents , and to declare insurgent vessels pirates , was not recognized , but that this did not involve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur-Frelinghuysen plan for the canalization of the Isthmus , on the general ground that paramount privileges of ownership , with corresponding obligations outside our own territory , are objectionable ; commends the Tehuantepec route for a ship railway , and the neutralization of any line of communication to be hereafter made across the Isthmus ; condemns the outrages on Chinamen in Wyoming and elsewhere , and declares that all the power of the Government will be employed for their protection  --  intimating , however , that it may be well , in view of the strong race prejudice against the Chinese , to imitate the Dominion of Canada , and make their exclusion more stringent ; condemns the conduct of Messrs . Sandford and Kasson in signing the Congo convention without reserve or qualification , and , therefore , does not ask the sanction of the Senate for the act ; announces payment of French claims on account of the war of the rebellion , and a report on the American claims against France for spoliations prior to 1801 ; denounces French restrictions on our pork , and still more strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued controversy with Germany touching rights of German-American citizens resident in that country ; proposes the appointment of it commission to consider the whole question of the British-American fishery question ; announces negotiations with Great Britain for extending the scope of the extradition treaty ; recommends more accurate tracing of the boundaries of Alaska ; asks for legislation to put in force the commercial treaty with Mexico ; commends to the attention of Congress the conclusions of the Berne Congress on the international copyright question ; recommends a revision of the naturalization laws ; condemns the Arthur-Frelinghuysen proposed commercial treaties with Spain and San Domingo , as surrendering large revenues for inadequate consideration , and giving up indispensable control over our own tariff ; urges the payment of consols wholly by adelpiate salaries , and thi abolition of the duty on foreign works of art , on the grounds with which we are all familiar , The message , summarizing the report of the Secretary of the Treasury , recommends a reduction of the tariff , through a lowering of duties on " the imported necessaries of life , " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwells on the importance of the silver question ; shows that only $50,000 , - 000 of the $215,759,431 already coined have got into circulation ; declares that the desire to utilize the silver product of the country should not lead to a perversion of the coinage powers of the Government , and that a continuance of the silver coinage at the present rate will before long lead to the substitution of silver for all the gold the Government owns . It points out that already at some periods 58 per cent . of the customs duties have been paid in silver , while the average is 20 per cent. ; that in view of all this the hoarding of gold has already begun , and that its total disappearance will let the country down once more on a depreciated currency , fluctuating in value ; that none will suffer from this state of things so much as the poor ; that history shows that all attempts to make coins of unequal value circulate side by side must prove futile ; that all efforts to get foreign nations to adopt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuccessful ; that the Latin Union has just entered into an agreement to stop coining silver , and to redeem in gold what has been already coined ; that " the debtor class " is not dishonest , and that , anyhow , it is not the rich creditors only who will suffer from the depreciation of our currency , but the widow , the orphan , and the depositors in savings banks ; and that prosperity hesitates and capital shrinks because of the uncertainty on this qiiestion . The message recommends , therefore , the suspension of the silver coinage now carried on under the Act of 1878 . After summarizing the operations of various Treasury bureaus , and the reports of the Navy and Interior Departments , and generally concurring in their recommendations , the message comes to the Mormon question ; reports the successful execution of the Edmunds Law ; denounces polygamy , and passes a glowing eulogium on monogamous homes ; recommends legislation to prohibit the importation of Mormon converts into this country . It commends the civil-service rules , and hopes " that we shall never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely as rewards for partisan service . Doubts may be well entertained whether our Government could survive the strain of a continuance of this system , which , upon every change of all administration , inspires an immense army of claimants for office to lay siege to the patronage of Government , engrossing the time of public officers with their importunities , spreading abroad the contagion of their disappointment , and filling the air with the tumult of their discontent " ; recommends an increase in the salaries of the Civil-Service Commissioners ; calls for an enlargement of the accommodation for the Congressional Library ; and , after a brief mention of the affairs of the District , and of the need of legislation touching the Presidential succession , closes with a protest against subordinating the needs , the welfare , and the aspirations of an intelligent and generous nation to the narrow ' advantages of partisanship or the accomplishment of selfish alms , COST OF OUR POLITICAL NAVY SECRETARY WinTNEY 's annual report is a great novelty in Navy Department literature . We doubt if a more thoroughly readable document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years . With malice toward none and with abundant charity for all , Mr. Whitney states in a straightforward , business-like manner the extraordinary condition of affairs which he finds in his department , putting the blame for all the defects upon the system and none of it upon the officials who are serving under its rules . His view of the system , as it has been built up during the past twenty years , seems to be that wise and economical administration under it is an impossibility ; that with the best of men in the positions of responsibility , all actuated by the best intentions , the machinery of the Department would still go on grinding out extravagant expenditures , political jobbery , and consequent general loss with almost no profit whatever to the Government , In other words , the machinery of the Department has been so completely organized in the interest of " politics " that it will turn out nothing else but " politics , " with all that the term implies , no matter what kind of an engineer is in charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a new basis of simple business principles . That the Secretary- does not overstate the evils of the present system is made plain by him in the general results which he cites as the fruit of the past twenty years of Navy Department management . One fact alone is enough to confirm the truth of his most sweeping statements . He says : " The country has expended since July 1 , 1868 ? more than three years subsequent to the close of the late civil war  --  over $75,000,000 of money on the construction , repair , equipment , and ordnance of vessels , which sum , with a very slight exception , has been substantially thrown away ; the exception being a few ships now in process of construction . I do not overlook the sloops constructed in 1874 , and costing $3,000,000 or $4,000 , - 000 , and to avoid discussion they may be excepted also . The fact still remains that for about seventy of the seventy-five millions of dollars which have been expended by the Department for the creation of a navy we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a single naval vessel finished and afloat at the present time that could be trusted to encounter the ships of any important Power  --  a single vessel that has either the necessary armor for protection , speed for escape , or weapons for defence . " That is , as the Secretary adds , no secret . Everybody knows that we have no navy that could keep afloat for half an hour in the face of attack from the war vessels of any respectable naval Power in the world . His analysis of the system in use in the Department shows with admirable clearness how this disgraceful condition of affairs has been brought about . In the first place , the responsibility for expenditures is so divided up among " bureaus " that there is no possibility of placing it anywhere . No one bureau knows what the other is doing ; each one audits its own accounts , and there is no central and final financial authority which has jurisdiction over them , The natural result is extravagance , open defiance of legal requirements concerning competitive bids on contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has a " pull " On a bureau gets all the contracts . The Secretary says that his examination of the
