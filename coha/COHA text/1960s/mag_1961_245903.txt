Children Run Longer Than Plays <P> ( See Cover ) <P> In an emergency room of Manhattan 's Roosevelt Hospital not long ago , a tall woman lay stretched out on a table , looking like a Valkyrie about to be immolated on her shield . Her youthful , pretty face was contorted . An intern was gently examining two fingers of her left hand , which had just been crushed in a car door , causing no serious damage but a great deal of pain . Trying to anesthetize the patient with small talk , he asked : " What do you do ? " The patient gripped a cotton pad soaked with smelling salts . and winced as she spoke . " Oh , dear God , " she said , laughing and crying simultaneously . " I 'm a humorist . " <P> A few months from now , the incident will undoubtedly appear in print , considerably embellished , and the opening sentence may well be something breezy like " There is an automobile loose on the streets of New York with two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred words about the professional sadism of doctors , the difficulty of opening a jar of instant coffee with one hand bandaged and the intricacies of Blue Cross ( " Until now I 'd always thought the term ' major medical had something to do with the armed services " ) . Undoubtedly there will also be a report on how at 3 a.m. the throbbing of a finger brings thoughts of gangrene , death , the need of carrying more insurance , whether one 's widower will simply mourn for years in silence , or whether he will remarry ( Tammy Grimes ? But can she cook ? ) . The whole thing will be light , deft , charming , and fetch $3,000 from virtually any magazine , not to mention an eventual movie sale . Almost any intern , life insurance salesman , housewife and child over five will readily recognize the style of Jean <P> Kerr , one of the pleasantest humorists now working , a woman who can transform the ordinary vicissitudes of life into laughter , expertly turning next-to-nothing into molehills . <P> <P> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear excerpts , for anyone within the range of Jean Kerr 's voice is a tryout audience . When friends go to see her new hit , Mary , Mary , Broadway 's brightest , wittiest play since The Moon Is Blue ( Warner Bros , bought it for more than $500,000 ) , they are not surprised to recognize some of the best lines . For Jean Kerr writes as she talks , and she talks all the time . Once , at a party , a tape recording was made of Noel Coward singing ; when it was played back , all that could be heard was Jean Kerr , talking . She is perfectly willing to listen to other people ; it is simply that most people would rather listen to her . As a result , she expends so much energy on talking-her blue eyes flashing , her arms semaphoring - that she has little strength left for other physical effort . She is a stand-up comedian who sits down . <P>                 @ @ @ @
