THE readiness of South Viet Nam 's Buddhist monks and nuns to burn themselves to death as a means of protest against the government both moves and repels the West . On the surface , it seems an odd phenomenon in a religion generally regarded as passive , gentle and full of reverence for life . The paradox is caused by the fact that Buddhism , though detached and otherworldly , can at times convulse itself into action , and that its view of life as transitional can lead to an almost indifferent embrace of death . Self-immolation is not merely a sit-in carried to Oriental extremes . Although it has not occurred often-and apparently never before in Viet Nam-the practice is deeply linked to the basic nature of Buddhism , the world 's fourth largest religion . <P> Nirvana &; Dharma . Buddhism consists of three spiritual components , two traditions , and a multiplicity of sects . The first of the three components , common to all Buddhists , is the legendary life of a handsome Indian prince named Gautama , who , about 600 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts of life for the first time : a sick man , an old man , a dead man and a holy man . He fled to the forest to seek enlightenment , tried and abandoned the ways of the hermit and the ascetic , and , after meditating under a sacred Bodhi tree for 49 days , at last achieved Buddhahood-enlightenment , or nirvana . He spent the rest of his life walking through India with his disciples , teaching until he died at 80 , leaving a final admonition : " Work out your salvation with diligence . " <P> Gautama 's teaching , the second chief component of Buddhism , is summed up in the Four Noble Truths : 1 ) man suffers all his life , and goes on suffering from one life to the next ; 2 ) the origin of man 's suffering is craving-for pleasure , for possessions , for cessation , of pain ; 3 ) the cure for craving is the practice of nonattachment to everything-even to the self ; 4 ) the way to nonattachment is the Eightfold Path-right views , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livelihood , right effort , right mindfulness , right meditation . The Buddha said nothing about God ; no divine judgment , but an inexorable law of cause and effect called dharma determines man 's weal or woe . <P> Third essential component of Buddhism is the vast body of monks and nuns called the sangha . In addition to celibacy and vegetarian nonviolence , monks practice poverty ; traditionally the only possessions permitted are robes , a begging bowl for food , a needle , prayer beads , a razor ( to shave the head once a fortnight ) , and a filter to remove bugs from the drinking water so as not to kill them .
