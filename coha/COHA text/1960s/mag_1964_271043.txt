Rudi Gernreich was bored to tears with necklines . The V neck , the scoop neck , the boat neck , the turtle neck , the square neck , even the deep-cut plunge , all seemed drags . But the California designer is an all-action-no-talk man , and in no time at all he had pulled himself together and come up with a rather refreshing idea : drop a neckline low enough , say to the waist . Then it actually wo n't be a neckline at all , and no one will be even the least bit bored . <P> Rudi was right as rain . His topless bathing suit ( designed as " a prediction of things to come " ) was first modeled in the flesh for buyers early this month , drew S.R.O . crowds and , of course , caused raging controversy . " Now come , boys , " wrote the New York Herald Tribune 's Eugenia Sheppard , " girls have been dropping the tops of their suits for years . " " It has no dignity , " snipped Designer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colleague Oleg Cassini explained that the suit could hardly influence him . " I 'm already very conscious , " he yawned , " of that part of the anatomy . " Through all the fuss , Rudi stood fast , insisted the suit was no gag . " After all , " he sighed , " women have been exposing their bosoms all through history . Now all of a sudden it 's a big deal . " <P> Buyers , devil-may-care in the showroom , found store owners back home far from bold , and plenty worried . Hess 's Department Store , in Allentown , Pa. , faced picket lines of women ( WE DRAW THE LINE , read the placards ) , was stuck with a shipment and the likelihood of few , if any , sales . Manhattan 's Lord &; Taylor changed its mind even before the suits arrived . " They will be sealed up immediately , " said the store 's president , Melvin Dawley , " and shipped to the poor . " More sophisticated Western ladies snapped up models available in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " nakedness and paganism go hand in hand , " the first few tentative attempts at bare-breasted exposure took place . One deterrent : very few girls have either the courage to strip or the bosom to make it worthwhile . <P> At week 's end , with all counties still not heard from , the topless suit remained a most delicate issue . As with Fanny Hill , the meek trembled while the smart set shrugged . English Channel Swimmer Florence Chadwick got practical and confused things even more . " I 'm too modest to wear a topless suit , " said she , " but it actually would be more comfortable . It would be even more comfortable to swim without the bot tom as well . " <P> Another idea for Rudi-should things get boring again .
