Dodging man-eating tigers and lumbering elephants , runaway ponga carts and revved-up Rolls-Royces , 125 million Indians go to the polls this week in the world 's biggest free election . The voters range from maharajahs to harijans ( untouchables ) , speak 845 different languages and dialects , come from seven different racial strains , including fair-skinned Punjabis in the north and ebony-colored Tamils in the south . Some 75% of them are illiterate ; they will mark their ballots with government-issue rubber stamps . Democracy is still a new experience for them , and many think that the ballot box is a place of worship to be daubed with vermilion paste and flower petals . <P> " Elections are not a good thing , because they bring out the worst in us , " says India 's Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , and in the final days of the campaign , there was plenty of evidence to support him . In Uttar Pradesh , four people were shot dead in riots ; in Kashmir , candidates opposed to the government claimed they were kidnaped by police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running against the Congress Party machine under her maiden name . Gayatri Devi , local politicos found another Gayatri Devi to run against her as an independent in order to split her vote . At a New Delhi rally , an onlooker hurled a shoe at a poet reciting verses onstage in praise of a Congress nominee ; the shoe missed , but in the resultant melee part of the platform collapsed . <P> Tipping the Scales . Candidates cannonaded each other with a barrage of epithets . So corrupt and inefficient is Congress , raged Chakravarti Rajagopalachari. leader of the free-enterprise Swatantra Party , that " it is time for us to open our umbrellas to protect ourselves against the heavy drizzle of Congress maladministration .

" Retorted Nehru : " He is cursing for the sake of cursing . " Lashing out against the Swatantra 's threat to his doctrinaire brand of socialism , Nehru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it helps India , I will not be a half Communist , but a full Communist . " <P> Key to Nehru 's campaign was the vital constituency of North Bombay , where independent Coalition Candidate J.B. Kripalani hoped to unseat Nehru 's left-lining Defense Minister Krishna Menon ( TIME cover , Feb. 2 ) . Posters hitting at Congress Candidate Menon 's soft stand on Red China 's border incursions proclaimed : " Patriots vote Kripalani ; Communists vote Menon . " Through North Bombay 's streets snaked a huge Kripalani procession headed by a phalanx of gaily garbed dancers . The demonstrators displayed a giant set of scales in which a full-sized effigy of Kripalani outweighed an image of Menon . <P> Crisscrossing the city , Menon sound trucks blared out the theme that Menon was a modern Marco Polo , spanning oceans and continents to defend India 's interests all over the globe . But Menon himself scarcely concealed his contempt for constituents . At one gathering in a slum area , he stretched out on the platform behind the party functionary who was eulogizing his accomplishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrambled to his feet and spoke a few words in English , which sailed right over his Hindi-speaking audience .
