txt President Kennedy has ordered a policy of severe restraint in preparing the budget for the fiscal year 1965 , He has virtually banned any new programs not already submitted to Congress . Becauseof " built-in " increases in various areas  --  above all , the space program  --  the spending side of the budget is certain to rise in the fiscal year beginning next July 1 , despite the policy of restraint , But the rise , reliable sources said today , will be much less than the increase of $5,000,000,000 to $6,000,000,000 that has occurred in each of the last four budgets . As the budget now shapes up , it will probably show expenditures a shade either side of $100,000,000,000 . The official estimate for the current fiscal year , made last January , is $98,800,000,000 . But the Administration has already announced that the actual spending will turn out to be less .

The reasons are political and economic . The most important is the political one . The President has concluded that only by a genuine effort to check spending can he get his proposal for a tax cut through Congress . He probably also senses a feeling of alarm in the country that Federal spending has been rising too fast . On the economic aspect the feeling in the Administration is not unanimous . But there is a strongly held view that a large tax cut combined with another big rise in spending would be , as one high official put it , " pouring the coals on the economy too fast . " Such a policy would result in a deficit of $12,000,000,000 to $14,000,000,000 . Instead , the deficit to be estimated in the budget is likely to be about $9,000,000,000 , close to the figure now estimated for the current year . As the economy grows , revenues are expected to increase slightly even with a tax cut . The problem of keeping the // Kennedy Orders Spending Curb In Budget for 1965 Fiscal Year rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bulk of each year 's spending is largely determined before the budget-making process starts , stemming from laws on the books and expenditures that result from commitments made in previous years . The " built-in " increased next year include , among other things , the following : 9A huge increase in the space program , perhaps as much as $1,000,000,000 . Much of this results from prior commitments . Another rise of several hundred million dollars in interest on the national debt . CIA $500,000,000 rise because of increases in the pay of Government employes , both military and civilian . 9The annual increases in such programs as welfare grants to the states and veterans ' pensions . 9The first-year effect of several Dew programs that Congress will probably enact this year , such as grants for higher education , aid for medical and dental schools and aid for new facilities for the mentally retarded .

However , there are few programs with " built-in " decreases . Apparently the only one of any size is the emergency accelerated public works program , which will show a drop in expenditures next year . Thus , some net increase in the total budget is regarded as unavoidable . As for new programs , it has been known for some time that ' the President would submit one of the periodic omnibus housing bills next year , if only because certain key programs will expire . Its expenditure effect will not be large , ' at least the first year . Outside that , there will re-I Iportedly be no significant new programs at all , except for a resubmission to Congress of such programs as aid to education that do not pass this year .
