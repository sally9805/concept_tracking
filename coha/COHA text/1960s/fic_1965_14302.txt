( The lights dim down in the house . A POLICEMAN comes out in front of the curtain with a club . He beats the curtain several times with the club , then walks into the audience and up the center aisle . He goes to the back of the house and bangs his club three times on the back of a chair . Someone reciting the " Gettysburg Address " comes on very loudly through the sound system . The curtains open . The lights come up slowly on a bare stage . Upstage center STU is sitting in a bathtub splashing water and talking in a singsong manner . The " Gettysburg Address " fades out as STU continues . ) STU And ya ' walk through the town .

They 'll get in all their little boats and push them out in the water . Then they 'll whisper to each other about what a nice night it is and how still it is and look at all the fireflies . Then they 'll row very softly out to the middle . Out in the deep part . And they 'll break out their thermos bottles full of coffee and split pea soup . And they 'll drink and whisper about you . About how big you are and how striped you are and how nice it would be to have your head cut off and mounted over the fireplace . They 'll get out their poles and the worms and the hooks and drop them over the side . The worm will just float for a while , then he 'll have a little spasm and wriggle on the hook . Then he 'll drown and sink all the way to the bottom and die in front of your long noses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then you 'll move a little bit . You 're pretty hungry but you 're not sure . So you take your time . You 're down there moving slowly around this worm , taking your time . And they 're up there drinking split pea soup and grinning and pointing at the moon and the pier and all the trees . You 're both hung up .

STU That 's going to be a good trip . JOY I guess so . STU All that way on a train . The seats fold back so you can sleep if you want to . You can look out the window too . You can see all kinds of different houses and people walking around . ( JOE comes on from left wearing a suit and dark glasses and carrying a fishing pole and a suitcase ; he looks at STU for a while , then crosses the stage and exits right . ) They have one whole car where you eat . And another car just for drinking . The tables are nailed to the floor so they do n't jiggle . You can buy a whole dinner for about five bucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . They just leave it on the table so you do n't have to keep asking for water . And a silver cup full of toothpicks . You sit there and pick your teeth and look out the window . Then you have to leave . They force you to leave because there 's a whole line of people waiting to eat . They 're all hungry . p. 12 JOY ( Off right ) Hi , Joe . JOE ( Off right ) Hi . MYRA ( Off right ) Have a biscuit . JOE Thanks . STU They stop once in a while but you can only get off at the big stations . You can only get off at places like St. Louis or Cincinnati . None of the small towns . And your butt aches after a while . Your butt really starts to ache . You can hardly stand it . So you have to get up and walk around . Up and down the aisles . Back and forth . JOE ( Off right ) Hm . Real butter . JOY ( Off right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STU Your butt aches so bad that your legs even start to ache . Your legs can fall asleep on a train . Then your feet . You have to walk fast . It 's better to sit in the rest room because you can stretch . You can stretch your legs out in there . And there 's old men in there taking nips on little wine bottles . They get drunk in there and throw up on the floor . Their wives do n't even know it because they 're asleep in the folding chairs . MYRA ( Off right ) Delicious . p. 13 JOE ( Off right ) Good jam , too . STU Then everyone falls asleep . Almost everyone at once . It 's dark so they figure they have to , I guess . The porter turns the lights out and right away everyone 's asleep . There 's a little girl running up and down the aisle . She does n't make any noise because everyone 's sleeping . There 's a Marine making it with somebody 's wife because her husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking his teeth and spitting little gobs of food into the aisle . Some fat guy is farting and he does n't even know it . The smell drifts down the aisle and stinks up the whole car . One fart after another . Big windy farts that sort of make a whizzing sound . Nobody can hear him but it stinks the whole car up . ( SALLY enters from left wearing dark glasses , fur coat , and carrying a suitcase and a fishing pole ; she watches STU for a while , then crosses to the tub and stands there . ) He moves a little in the seat because he can feel it , I guess . His wife moves a little and rubs her nose . Then they keep on sleeping . The car stinks more and more . The smell gets into the seats and the pillows and the rug . Everyone 's smelling it at the same time . They sleep more and more . Then it 's morning . SALLY Hi . STU ( Sitting up and yawning ) Whew ! What time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , too ? SALLY Yep . STU Do you have all your stuff ? SALLY Yep . STU It 's a good day to leave . SALLY Why ? STU I mean it 's sunny . The sun 's out . SALLY It 's cold though .

( STU puts the towel over his head . ) STU ( Talking like an old lady ) Dainty little things . Too early . Too early to swim . Water 's too cold . There 's a little bitty wind skippin ' over the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tsk , tsk . Got to wear your tennies on account of the shells . ( JIM comes on from left wearing a suit and dark glasses and carrying a suitcase and fishing pole ; he watches STU . ) Got to wear a shirty on account of the sun . Ca n't lay around in the sand on account of your crotch . Smear a lot a ' chicken fat on yer tiny fragile legs . Get back in the cabin , girlie ! Do n't go faintin ' on the beach ! p. 15 JIM Are you going , Stu ? STU ( Still old lady ) None a ' yer business , sonny ! Get away from this beach ! Go on ! Get off my sand !

STU ( Still old lady ) Anyway the water 's up . There wo n't be a boat for days . They do n't come in when it 's high like this . The tide and all . Boats are chicken , too . Chickens run boats . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to calm . It 'll warm up and they 'll come in with their sails down and their nets hangin ' over the edge . They 'll all be drinkin ' gin and singin ' sea songs . They 'll all be horny for the young virgins that walk the beaches in their two-piece flimsy things . Then they 'll come onto the land and start screwing everything in sight . The boats 'll be hung up for days because everybody 's screwing on the beach . They 'll like it more and more . Once they get the taste for it they wo n't stop . The boats will be there for months because everybody 's screwing . Nobody wants to go nowhere because screwing is all they need . Screwing and screwing . And all those boats just sitting out there with their sails down and their nets hanging and rotting in the sun . Years go by and they 're still screwing . Old sailors with bald heads and old virgins with gray hair . The whole beach littered with bodies on top of each other . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean . One at a time . They break into bits and crack each other as they go down . One at a time . They sink . Pieces of wood float and wash up onto the beach but nobody cares . Nobody needs boats or wood or sails or nets . There 's a whole new crop of corny virgins walking around . Up and down the beach in their two-pieces . Nobody stops . More babies from the virgins . Males and females up and down the beach . No clothes any more . A mound of greasy bodies rolling in sperm and sand sticking to their backs and sand in their hair . Hair growing all over . Down to their feet . Pubic hair without bows or ribbons . ( He talks in normal voice and takes the towel off his head . ) Hair on their toes . Fires ! Fires at night . All over the island there 's huge fires flaring and they all lie around . They lie there fucking by the fire and picking each other 's nose . They lick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all they want to . They roll around farting and spitting and licking up and down . Long tongues and wet legs . Then they build a house . A big house way up on the side of a hill . It takes a year to build . It 's one house with one room and a fire pit in the middle . They all go in and sit on the floor and make rugs . They make rugs because the floor is cold and they do n't like the cold . They start weaving and sewing . Big huge heavy rugs with fringe around the edge and diamond shapes in the middle . Orange and red rugs with yellow diamonds . They stop screwing , see , and they just make rugs . All day . Years of making rugs until the whole house is covered . The walls are covered and the ceiling and the floor . The windows are blocked up and they sit . The fire 's out because of the rugs . It 's warm . They 're very warm inside . Sitting . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of the rugs . Then they start to giggle . One of them starts and they all start . One after another until they ca n't stop . The whole house is giggling . Then they scream , see . They start screaming all together because they ca n't breathe . On account of the rugs . The rugs are all sewn together and it 's very warm . It 's boiling hot inside . They start to sweat and run around . They bump into each other be-because it 's dark . They ca n't see so they hit and claw each other with their nails . They have long nails . They kick and scream and the sweat is rolling off them . They ca n't breathe and it 's hot . They 're screaming , see . ( Off stage right the actors giggle , STU sits slowly in the bath-tub , the giggling stops . ) And they come out . One at a time . They walk in a line out of the house . One behind the other . Down the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . They do n't even breathe . They just walk in a line . Down to the beach . They walk across the beach and right into the water . One behind the other . They just keep walking until you ca n't see them any more . ( He lies back in the tub so that his head is out of view and his feet hang over the edge . JOY comes on from right dressed in a bright red hat and a red dress ; she is pulling a wagon loaded with all the suitcases . The rest of the actors come on whistling and cheering , they all hold their fishing poles , they stand in a group stage right waving and throwing kisses at JOY as JOY backs up slowly with the wagon waving back to them. ) p. 17 MYRA Have a good time ! SALLY So long , Joy ! JOE So long ! JIM Good luck out there ! JOE See you , babe ! JIM ' Bye ! JOE ' Bye , ' bye ! JOY ' Bye ! MYRA Say hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun ! JOE Good luck ! JOY Thanks ! JOE See you later ! ( JOY keeps backing up with the wagon and exits left . The four actors throw kisses , then walk slowly downstage ; they stand in a line across the stage facing the audience , then they all cast their lines into the audience . They sit simultaneously and look at the audience while holding their poles . ) STU ( With his head still unseen ) Then the water goes out again because it 's nighttime . I guess it goes out . Yes . At night the water always goes out . And the sand gets all dry in the place where the water used to be . You can hear it making little slapping sounds and getting farther away from the pier . There 's a breeze sort of . One of those high breezes that just hits the top of your head and blows paper cups down the beach . Your back shivers a little and you get goose bumps on your legs . Your toes start to sweat . The sweat runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick to your socks . You ca n't move because your feet are stuck . You ca n't move your head . Your head stays straight and your eyes are wide open . You ca n't blink your eyes . Your hands sweat just like your feet . Your fingers swell up like your toes . ( The lights start to dim slowly . ) The sweat runs down your arms and down your legs . You 're looking out and you can see the water . You can see it in the dark because it 's white . Like milk . The whole top is covered with milk . It smells . Your nose is burning from the smell but you ca n't move . You keep looking to the other side . The smell gets worse and your ears start to hum . You can see these little dots on the other side . These lights . Your eyes stay open . Then you move . Your start to move slowly up the beach . Your feet hurt and your nose is bleeding from the smell . Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the other . Between the trees . You can see them blinking . On and off . A whole town . ( JOY backs on stage from left again pulling the wagon ; she exits right . ) Your eyes start blinking with the lights . Your feet start moving . You can feel them move inside your socks . Then your arms . You 're running . You can feel the breathing . Panting sort of . The wind comes in through your nose and dries the blood . You can taste it . Your mouth opens and the wind comes in . Your body 's moving . The sweat dries on your legs . You 're going now . Much faster and the breathing gets harder . You can see the lights better now . Yellow lights between the trees . The smell stops . The humming stops . The lights go out . ( The lights come up to their full brightness , STU jumps out of the bathtub and crosses very fast downstage center facing the audience , the other actors remain sitting and staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathes in and out very fast . ) That 's great ! See my stomach . In and out . It 's breathing . I 'm taking it in . The air . What a fine bunch of air I 'm taking in . Now I 'm taking it in through my nose . See . ( He breathes through his nose . ) Aaah ! Great ! Now my mouth . ( He breathes through his mouth . ) Good ! In and out ! Ladies and gentlemen , the air is fine ! All this neat air gathered before us ! It 's too much ! ( The other actors start to breathe slowly , gradually , making sounds as they inhale and exhale . ) The place is teeming with air . All you do is breathe . Easy . One , two . One , two . In . Out . Out , in . I learned this in fourth grade . Breathing , ladies and gentlemen ! Before your very eyes . Outstanding air . All you need to last a day . Two days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't stop . Once you get the taste of it . The hang of it . What a gas . In your mouth and out your nose . Ladies and gentlemen , it 's fantastic ! ( They all breathe in unison as JOY backs on stage from right pulling the wagon ; she exits slowly left as the lights dim and go out . There are three loud knocks from the back of the house. )
