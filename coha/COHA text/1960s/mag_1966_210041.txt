Critics of fraternities contend that they are anachronistic because today 's college students tend to be serious about scholarship , scoff at any pretentions to status , consider secret rituals something for Klans or kids , resist togetherness , applaud all moves toward individual equality . Despite official pressure against racial discrimination , the blackball system , which forfeits membership control to the most prejudiced among a chapter 's members , still keeps most fraternities segregated .
