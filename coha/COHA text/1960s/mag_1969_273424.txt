" The immediate task in 1969 is to make a decisive step toward price stability . This will be only the beginning of the journey . We can not hope to reach in a single year the goal that has eluded every industrial country for generations-that of combining high employment with stable prices . " <P> With a mixture of prophecy and prescription , Lyndon Johnson last week summed up the chief economic challenge that he bequeaths to Richard Nixon . In his final economic report to Congress , he called for a strategy aimed at slowly reducing both inflation and the excessive boom in business . The principal ingredients are a small-and perhaps precarious-budget surplus ( see THE NATION ) and a Federal Reserve Board policy of permitting the supply of money and credit to expand less than it has over the past three years . What the nation must avoid , warned Johnson , is " an overdose of restraint " that could easily lead to recession . <P> No Jolt . In most essentials , the Nixon Administration and the independent Federal Reserve Board seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Treasury-designate David Kennedy last week , " we must maintain a tight budget and a restrictive monetary policy . " The Federal Reserve has gone to considerable lengths lately to proclaim its intent to curb credit gradually . <P> How much restraint can the economy stand ? One indication came in a Los Angeles speech by Andrew Brimmer , a member of the seven-man Federal Reserve Board . Citing a study by the board 's staff , Brimmer said that even if the nation 's real economic growth slowed to practically nothing for one or two quarters , the result would be only a 0.2% rise in the jobless rate , now at a 15-year low of 3.3% . The findings reinforce the belief that the Nixon Administration will have a bit of leeway in which to move against wage-price rises without causing a significant increase in unemployment . But Brimmer and the other Federal Reserve governors believe that " some increase " in the jobless rolls will be unavoidable in a successful fight against inflation . <P> Fortunately , no jolting slowdown is expected . In its annual report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6% gain ( to $941 billion ) in Gross National Product this year . Inflation should account for " a little more than 3% " of that growth and real output " less than 3% . " Real growth last year was 5% . <P> The council foresees continued weakening in housing and consumer spending , a moderate $10 billion rise in federal spending , and strong gains in business outlays for new factories . The 10% surtax , along with federal spending restraints , will bring a " significant slowdown " in business during the first half of this year , said the council . The latest figures support that outlook . From November to December , retail sales slipped by 2% and housing starts by 15%.
