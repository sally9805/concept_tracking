He asked Congress for the prompt enactment of both sets of proposals in " a single comprehensive bill . " Favor Delay on Reforms Some of his Congressional ' leaders , however , are urging action on tax reduction this year , with postponement of the proposed reforms until next year . They include Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota , Democratic whip of the Senate , and Hale Boggs of Louisiana , Democratic whip of the House . Mr. Humphrey was quoted by the Associated Press today as having advocated such a twobill approach at the White House . The A.P . said that the Senator reported a " favorable response " from the President . Mr. Humphrey was out of the country today and unavilable for questioning .

Mr. Yntema , as spokesman for the Research a n d Policy Committee of the Committee for Economic Development , expressed concern over the possibility that tax reduction would be unduly delayed . Speed Is Called Vital " Because we believe that prompt rate reduction is important , " he said , " we think it is unwise to hinge reduction of the rates upon enactment of a long list of complex and hotly disputed structural revisions of the . tax system .

" If the American people find the $3,500,000,000 revision bill so bitter that they will not swallow it without $13,500,000 , - 000 of rate reduction sugar coating , " he asserted , " perhaps they should n't swallow it at all , " he said . The Budget Director , appearing before the Ways and Means Committee in support of t h e President 's tax program , said the Administration 's firm policy was to hold the rate of increased Federal spending " substantially below " the rate of increased revenues . He predicted a. balanced budget would be achieved under that policy despite a temporary reduction in revenues resulting from the proposed cuts in tax rates . He said " a good estimate " of the year in which revenues would equal expenditures was 1967 . He called 1967 " the most likely first year " of a balanced budget but added that it was " conceivable " the goal would be realized earlier .
