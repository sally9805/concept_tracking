txt Harold Seltzer sat last night in his 30th floor apartment overlooking the waters of . Lake Michigan that , a few hours before , had nearly become his grave . He glanced once at the calm waters of the lake , then turned away and shuddered . " I was in the South Pacific for three years during the second World War , " Seltzer said , " but that was on a big battleship . " Lake Becomes Ocean " In that little dinghy , Lake Michigan looked like the South Pacific . " Seltzer and his younger son , Steven . 20 , and two other men spent 20 hours in the dinghy after Seltzer 's power boat burned and sank . One of the other men , Bertram Miner , 31 , is a nephew of the late Judge Julius H. Miner of federal District court . " Miner went into the smoke to get a plug for the dinghy , " Steven Seltzer said . " He got . into the dinghy and fell overboard and lost the plug . " Then my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Miner went back into the smoke to get it . " Steven Seltzer then had to go back aboard the burning boat on another errand . They had forgotten the oarlocks for the dinghy . Plane Flies Over " The boat was on fire for an hour and a half , " ' Steven said , " and while it was burning , a plane flew over . " " We figured we 'd be saved , " his father said . " 0 , wonderful ! The pilot was going to report the fire . And , you know , he evidently never reported it . " They rowed their dinghy for a while , then discontinued the effort at nightfall Saturday : The cold was a problem . Miner and the four t 11 man in the dinghy , Abe Paulson , 39 , had no shoes . They wrapped two life preservers around their feet in an effort to keep warm . Paulson , midwest district manager for the Nikon Camera company , had no shirt either . " I had a shirt and a T-shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man my shirt so we 'd all have something . " Steven said the four kept warm Saturday night by " hugging each other . " They had no food . " We were lucky , " Steven 's father said , " we had 20 hours of flat water out there . " If we had n't , we would n't be here , and you 'd be writing our obituary . " Tried Rowing Again They rowed some more yesterday morning , then stopped because they could n't ascertain their direction on the cloudy day . " I gave up hope at noon , " said Seltzer , a former quartermaster first class who piloted the battleship Massachusetts during World War II . " We decided we 'd just lie down in the dinghy , all four of us , and keep warm . " " I picked up my head , " Steven said , " and all of a sudden there was this great big white sail . " Thru with Boating The big sailboat , 73 feet long , came about once , then returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Old Town restaurant owner who purchased the power boat  --  his first boat  --  last September at the age of 50 , said he would never buy another after his ordeal .
