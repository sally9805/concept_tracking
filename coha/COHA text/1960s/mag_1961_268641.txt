At the age of 64 , Painter William Gropper is , as one Manhattan critic wrote last week , " one of the honorable old guard of American painting . " But the phrase should not be taken to mean that age has neutralized the acid of his style . As his new exhibition at the ACA Gallery proves , Gropper still paints villainous politicians and overstuffed capitalists-all the targets that were so in vogue in the 1930s . Yet essentially his paintings are scenes of human foolishness and tragedy , and these constants carry no date . <P> It would be strange if Gropper were not concerned with the flaws of society , for his early life followed closely the standard biography of the typical young radical . He was born on Manhattan 's Lower East Side , a land of pushcarts and bewildered immigrants finding their way in a new world . His father had a gift for languages , but none at all for keeping a job . His mother took in piecework sewing , and Gropper himself , once he had quit school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5 a week . In spite of the ten-hour working day , Gropper found time to draw , and hungered for further training in art . <P> " Comrade Bill . " He joined a small class run by Robert Henri and George Bellows , both of whom rambled on about love , life and art and seemed to make it a point to disagree about everything . Then one day at the clothing store , young Gropper did a series of political caricatures that someone took to Garret Garrett , assistant editor of the old New York Tribune . Gropper soon found himself a full-fledged cartoonist making $40 a week . When he became enraptured by the Redlining I.W.W. , the Tribune dropped him , but by then he was established . He worked for every sort of publication , from the New Masses to Spur , from Dial to Vanity Fair , where the aristocratic Frank Crowninshield fondly called him " Comrade Bill . " <P> An extraordinarily gentle and soft-spoken person , Gropper seemed the angriest of men on canvas . His paunchy bosses , downtrodden workers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headlines but were a staple of the artistic diet . After World War II , taste in art changed , and to look at a Gropper painting became rather like rereading Grapes of Wrath . American art became less interested in humanity , downtrodden or otherwise , than in art for its own sake . <P> " The Need for a Friend . " Such impersonality was unbearable to Gropper : " I need to find the human element the way I need to find a friend . " Strangely , after the long reign of the abstractionists , Cropper 's work looks not like a set of period pieces but like something almost new . In him , the cartoonist , the caricaturist and the artist are jumbled up together , and sometimes the cartoonist overrides the artist . <P> Even at their most naive , the paintings have a rare compassion . Small boys look out upon the world with eyes filled with wonder ; an old woman stands in front of a clock that ticks away her life . The stock oppressors-the politicians and the plutocrats-are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His work is in a durable tradition : a Gropper senator does not date any more than a Daumier judge or a Prussian officer by George Grosz . In Gropper , the " old guard " seems amazingly young .
