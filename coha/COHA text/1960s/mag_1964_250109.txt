One of the 20th century 's greatest romances is between the businessman and the jet . Of ' the passengers on U.S. domestic flights , a remarkable 86% are businessmen . Their rush to take advantage of the jet 's speed and convenience has not only helped to hike airline bookings and earnings ( trunkline profits so far in 1964 are up 94% to $158 million ) , but is also having profound effects on the very methods of doing business . " I can reach our principal distributors in Phoenix , Denver , Salt Lake or Spokane in two hours , " says Los Angeles ' Thomas A. Welch , western regional sales manager for Carrier Corp . " What 's happened is nothing less than a revolution . " <P> Here Comes the Boss . Everyone from chief executive to chief clerk seems to be flying for the company , but no one has felt the revolution 's effect quicker than salesmen . Once they plodded from stop to stop with a sample case jammed into a Pullman berth ; today they jet across greatly expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as air freight rather than as expensive excess baggage . In the era of the seven-league sell , salesmen also have to be more alert . Sales managers jet around , too , and more often than not they skim off big and previously inaccessible customers for the home-office account . Then there are the more frequent visits from the top . " Any time the boss is in an area , " says Earl C. Janson , manufacturing director of Beckman Instruments , " you 're bound to increase the energy level .

Bankers and buyers travel to New York 's money and merchandise markets more often , but for shorter lengths of time . The length of occupancies in Manhattan hotels has dropped from 3 clays to 2.2 clays per guest with the advent of the jets . " We go to New York at the drop of a hat , " says Vice President Brown Meggs of Hollywood-based Capitol Records . " The jet has made the whole thing much more casual . " <P> As Easy as Washington . It is also causing significant changes in corporate procedure . Lear Siegler now supervises eleven divisions with four corporate officers , who spend half their time traveling . International Harvester has disposed of five company planes , since commercial jets can do the job just as well . Company travel budgets have risen sharply : the Garrett Corp . of Los Angeles spends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
