 | I suppose I 'll never be able to forget the night Carol told me . It was a warm spring evening and I 'd let Bobby ? he 's Carol 's sixyear-old brother ? stay at a friend 's for supper . That meant that for the first time in weeks Carol and I were alone together . I remember thinking , as I was getting dinner , that maybe now she would let down her guard and I could finally find out why she 'd been acting so strangely lately ? so withdrawn and closed within herself . Secrecy was not a bit like Carol . She 'd always been the kind of bubbly yet sensible girl who tends if anything to be too open with people instead of too reserved . At any rate , until a few months before that night , she and I had been far closer than most mothers and daughters . And far friendlier .... Then things began to change . The rift ? if that 's what you 'd call it ? had begun sometime during the previous fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sports-car crowd at school began to cultivate her . Most of them were older , richer , more sophisticated by far than my sixteen-year-old and I had tried to warn her about the dangers of accepting other people 's values , especially those of an obviously fast crowd . But after a few months ? to my great relief ? she had stopped seeing her new friends and , although I still could n't seem to get through to her , I was confident things would soon return to normal . That was the situation on that evening in May when Carol suddenly turned to me , her face pinched and white , and said in a flat voice , " Well , Mom , you were right about ruining my life . I 'm three months pregnant . " There it was , blunt and ugly . The words seemed to hang there , fighting their way into my consciousness . I stood stark still ? putting glasses on the table , my back to her . Finally I turned and looked into her eyes . What I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror , pleading for help and not knowing how to ask for it . . . . A glass slipped from my hand and crashed to the floor . The sound shattered the numbness that had immobilized us . " Oh , Mother , " she was sobbing now . " What am I going to do ? " I ran to her and took her in my arms . Maybe I should have been strong and brave at that moment , but I was n't . We stood there , holding each other for support , crying together . We were two women suddenly shattered by a tragedy that I thought could happen only to other people . And yet , at the same time , we were somehow cemented by the knowledge that we would endure our ordeal together . At the moment , I had no thought for what we would do . All I knew was that my baby daughter was hurt ? dreadfully hurt ? and all because of the innocence that I had nurtured in her . Somehow , some way , I would save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question . Carol came to her senses first . " I 'll clean up the floor , Mom , " she said ,  | wiping her eyes . " You put away the food . " For the moment she was the strong one helping me through that first awful shock . As we cleared away , I tried to think of how such a thing could have happened . Bob , my husband , had died of a heart attack four years ago , when Carol was twelve and Bobby two . Many years before I had worked as a buyer in a department store but I 'd quit when I found I was expecting Carol . When Bob died , I had gone back to work , not only because we needed the money , but also because without Bob I was desperately lonely . Carol was a beautiful child , blessed with a kind of soft , blonde sweetness . She had always been a good student , if not an outstanding one . Physically , she matured early , and at fourteen had entered high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , half the boys in the school were phoning her for dates , but she seemed to set up her own very sensible rules . She went to lots of parties , and occasionally on double dates , but rarely did she see one boy alone . I was proud of her . And then , last fall , Jeff Duncan started phoning . He was eighteen , the son of wealthy parents , members of the country-club set , and wellknown around town . He had already been picked up for fast driving several times , and once for driving while drunk . At first , I just noticed that all of Carol 's phone calls seemed to be coming from one boy . Then one morning I saw a green convertible out in front of the house waiting to drive Carol to school . Lounging behind the wheel was Jeff , handsome and languid , with a kind of volatile quality about him . " I did n't know you were so friendly with Jeff , " I said , trying to sound casual . " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's a senior and every girl in school 's after him . He 's really dreamy . " " He may be dreamy , " I said , " but I 've heard that he drinks and drives too fast . " " Oh Mother , do n't be silly , " she said as she opened the front door . " He 's really a very nice person and he likes me a lot . All the girls are purple with envy . He says I seem a lot older than my age . " That 's just what I was afraid of . I watched her fly down the walk and jump into his car , then lean over to be casually kissed good morning . . . . I was literally almost sick with fear . That day at work all I could think about was getting home and trying to talk some sense into her head . It was n't going to be easy , I knew . What girl would n't be flattered by the attentions of an older boy ? And for Carol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time those lyrics in the rock-and-roll ballads seemed to be talking just to her . When I got home that evening , Carol was n't there . Bobby was in his room , lost in a new book about trains . I went in and kissed him . " Is n't your sister home yet ? " I asked . " Nope , " Bobby answered , hardly looking up . " She must have had a club meeting or something . " About 6:30 Carol came in , her hair wild , her face flushed , looking excited and terribly vulnerable . I looked at her without saying a word , but she knew what I was thinking . " Why do n't you ask me , Mom ? " she said . " Sure , I was out with Jeff and some of the other kids . We drove out to the reservoir . Great fun ! " She threw her books on a chair . " Dinner wo n't be late , will it ? They 're calling for me in a half hour . " " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to hold back a sudden surge of anger . " This is a school night and you 're not going anywhere except to your room to do homework . Besides , I want to have a little talk with you . " It sounded awfully lame , even to me ? not at all like the speech I 'd been rehearsing all day . " I did all my homework in study hall , Mom , and I promise I wo n't be late , " she said . " Ca n't we have that talk tomorrow night ? " She gulped down her dinner and before I knew it the green car was out in front of the door again , honking . Pecking me on the forehead , she dashed out . I 've never seen her look so happy , but it made me all the more afraid . I sat up until eleven and she still was n't home . I tried to read but  | could n't . Finally , not able to bear another moment 's waiting , I looked up Jeff 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sleeps voice answered after several rings . " Mrs. Duncan ? " I asked . " I 'm terribly sorry , to bother you at this time of night , but my daughter went out with your son about seven and has n't returned yet . I wonder if you know where they 've gone , or if you 've heard from them . " She gave a laugh that , even over the wire , sounded hard and bitter . " I have no idea , " she said , " who my son 's friends are or where he is . If I were you , I 'd relax . Surely if your daughter 's out with Jeff , she 's able to take care of herself . He does n't ordinarily go in for girls who need baby-sitters . " Even in the state I was in , I could see that nothing would be gained by prolonging the conversation . Mrs. Duncan was obviously a woman with no capacity for either affection or interest . Perhaps that 's why she had gone overboard on material things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second a wave of sadness washed over me ? sadness for a boy who had been given every conceivable advantage except what he really needed . I said good-by as calmly as I could and hung up . If Carol 's key had n't turned in the lock just then , I do n't know what I would have done . As she walked in the door , I grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her wildly . " Where have you been ? " I screamed . " How dare you worry me like this ? Where could you possibly have gone until this hour on a weekday night ? You told me you 'd be home soon . " To add to the horror , I smelled liquor on her breath . But she seemed sober . She just stood like a rag doll , letting me shake her . Then she pulled from my grasp . " I 'm a big girl , Mother , and I had a date . We just went for a ride ? that 's all . " Carol had always had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we spoke , but now she was unable to meet my eyes . Tears were pushing their way to the surface and she was trying hard to keep control of herself . " Let me go to bed now , Mother , " she said  | shakily . " I 'm tired and I have school tomorrow . " Very slowly she walked upstairs . I heard her turn her lock . With that gesture she closed the door on her childhood , and me ? at least for some time to come . From then on , she was different ? self-contained , remote , silent . But the green car did n't stop at our door any more and Jeff Duncan stopped phoning . One day , about a month later , I came home early from work with a miserable headache . I dropped my bag and coat and climbed wearily up the stairs . As I passed Carol 's room , I looked in the open door . She was lying on the bed , staring at the ceiling , the little brown bear that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that instant I saw a picture of despair ? mute , hopeless , passive ? that I shall never be able to get out of my mind . I tiptoed past the door without speaking . Whatever was torturing her would have to come out eventually , but there was nothing I could do then to help her . Four weeks later it did come out ? the night she told me she was pregnant . After my initial shock , when my thoughts stopped churning , I took her hand and led her to the sofa . " It was Jeff , was n't it ? " I asked . " Yes , Mom , it was J-J-Jeff . " She could hardly say his name . The tears were starting again . She buried her face in her hands . " It was so awful . I thought I was being smart . He had a bottle in the car ? and he said that I should take a drink because all the girls did . I choked on it , Mom , but afterward I felt all light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked up at me , her little face pale and used . " Then , when he started to make love to me , I did n't like it . I tried to stop and I could n't . He hurt me . It was n't how he said it would be at all . " She pounded her fist into her other palm . " I hate boys , " she sobbed . " I hate them all . " What was I to do ? All I knew was that my child 's life was a shambles , and that it was up to me to try to put the pieces together again . I was faced with the hardest problem of my life and I did n't know whether I was up to it . And yet I had to be . She looked  | so small , sitting there , waiting for me to utter some wise words that were going to make her well , that would fix everything . " Have you told Jeff ? " I asked . " After it happened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never even existed . Then later I tried to speak to him at school , but he just avoided me . Last week , after I saw the doctor , I waited in Jeff 's car after school so he 'd have to talk to me . When I told him , he laughed and said , Well , that 's what you get for being a naughty girl . ' And then he said that it probably was n't his anyway , that I 'd most likely been with lots of different boys . " That settled it for me . Whatever Carol and I did now , she should leave Jeff out of her plans . Marriage to such a man would only compound the tragedy . " I think you have only two choices , Carol , " I said . " There is probably somewhere we can go to get you an abortion . But remember , it 's against the law ? both the law of our land and the laws of life . You 'd be destroying a human being ? a person who already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your baby . " As best as I could , I tried to tell her what both choices would involve for her . I kept my voice calm , told her that life was long and that other people had survived tragic mistakes . I did n't try to gloss over the unavoidable shame she would face or the cruel gossip . " Whatever you decide , " I said , " I 'll help you all I can . But you 'll have to make up your mind soon and I ca n't help you do it . " Carol got up from the sofa and started for the stairs , almost like a sleepwalker . My heart broke as I looked at that ragged little face , streaked with tears she 'd shed , but dry-eyed now . I watched her climb the stairs . Then I sat down by myself . . . . I do n't know how long Carol was gone , but when she returned her shoulders were straight ; she had washed her face and combed her hair , and she was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " But first I want to tell you something . I love you very much .... And I 've made up  | my mind to have my baby . " She stood before me . " I hope you 'll be able to forgive me for what I 've done . " There was nothing to forgive . I was proud of her . For sixteen , she was quite a woman ! And I told her Next morning Carol went off to school and I set about finding out what we could do . With the help of our local Family Service Agency , I found a home for unwed mothers not too far away where Carol would get good care and sound counseling during her months of waiting and wondering and regretting . Two-and-a-half months later , I put her on a train . I had offered to go with her but she had chosen otherwise . " This is one I 'm going to have to face alone , Mother , " she had said . " I 've got a lot of thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wrote me every week and I knew that she was thinking ? harder than ever before in her life ? about whether to keep her baby or give it for adoption . I knew too that there was gossip in our town , but I tried to silence it by telling people she 'd taken a job as a camp counselor . And then her last letter came . She had made her decision : she would give her baby up for adoption . The agency was already searching for - citable parents . But , she wrote , she ranted me with her when the baby was born . . . . When they brought her down from delivery , I was waiting . " Your baby is a beautiful little girl , " I told her , " and she 's going to have a wonderful home with parents who 'll love her . " " I just hope they 'll be able to teach her how to handle her life before she makes the mistake I did , " she murmured sleepily . . . . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's very different . She 's more subdued ? not cynical , really , but terribly suspicious of life . She visits a counselor every week and gradually , God willing , she will come to know again that not all men are Jeff Duncans . Then , I 'm sure , she will find one she can love enough to tell him what has happened and he will understand . Meanwhile , we can just go on living and hoping and learning from day to day .
