DECEMBER 24 , 1966 . But Sir Kenneth Clark 's introduction to Nicky Mariano 's ample recreation of her life with Bernard and Mary Berenson catches the essence of those forty years and her relation to " B.B. " at that " curious microcosm of civilization that grew up around him at I Tatti . " Miss Mariano tries to describe every important or eccentric figure in their rich and active world , and that effort at times interferes with the central concerns : Nicky herself , B.B. and Mary , and finally lesser figures like Edith Wharton . Miss Mariano 's language is fresh and original , and one has the sense of her continually enlarging a life to which there were few spiritual or intellectual limits . Arriving at 1 ' Tatti a striking and vigorous young woman , conscious of her lack of training , she was soon put in charge of the library , and in a few years had become , as Sir Kenneth puts it , B.B. 's " companion and guardian , organizing his work , saving his energies , reassuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as possible , from the rough usages of ordinary life . " Gradually she took Mary 's place , and for this long stretch of life it was a wonderfully successful menage troi3 , with Nicky holding the other two together , taking life as it came , in love with B.B. and devoted to Mary . " Somehow Mary 's light faded as B.B. appeared on the scene . " Think of it ? forty years , and during ured assessment of our war capacity ; quiet words ; deep resolution combined of them were on a trip to Orvieto , that Nicky for the first time felt no self-consciousness . Weather , temperature , light were all perfect , B.B. carefree , as they skirted the lake of Balsena through oakwoods all golden with yellow broom . She was in seventh heaven , not yet fully aware how much her responsiveness to everything was due to B.B. 's presence . Mary and her husband were as " different as the art of a jeweler from that of a stonecutter . " He was slender and lithe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward gait , moving heavily , with noble features and thin lips , tending to be slovenly , disliking elegance . She was a majestic force of nature , once beautiful . B.B. would liken her to a dreadnought to which one had to hang on or be drowned , They could not live long in the same house and got along better traveling , seeing things , treating life as a series of adventures . Mary was bracing as mountain air when in a good temper , depressing as a sirocco when out of sorts , and had a contempt for cultivated people . Miss Mariano 's vignettes are striking and sometimes refreshingly inelegant : Robert Trevelyan , " Trevy , " George Trevelyan 's older brother , an intimate at I Tatti , was " tall , lean , uncouth , with dishevelled grey hair , a long inquisitive nose , corduroy trousers , heavy boots , with poor table manners . " Meeting him with a knapsack of books on his back , two of his friends had stopped their car and asked him to lunch : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody at present . " " Then I had rather come another time " - the English at their candid best . Trevy had married a highly cultivated but rather heavy Dutch woman , because she shared his ardently pro-Boer feelings during the South African War . There was a visit from a curious English trio - Vanessa Bell , almost invariably wrapped in sulky silence ; Maynard Keynes , aloof and oracular ; Duncan Grant , unconcerned and pleasant . Belle Green , who was in charge of the Morgan Library , is characterized as a woman of great vitality and plenty of intelligence , a provocatively exotic physical type , but somehow unharmonious , almost crude , in speech and manner . She had , Mary told Nicky , played a " dangerous " part in Berenson 's life . In describing her sister ( married to Bertrand Russell ) Mary Berenson writes Nicky : " At bottom we are at war , for she is and remains an ist of every kind , feminist , prohibitionist , philanthropist , pacifist , and she despises me for being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - responsive to the needs and delights of the senses ; knowing the importance of good food and getting it ; conscious of the sharpness and strength of nature , admitting the coarse rough play of small adventure on their trips together , allowing indecencies , if they said something , to play their part . A few years after she had joined the Berensons , Nicky and B.B. went to New York on one of their rare trips to the United States . The experience was lurid . At one millionaire dinner party " the table literally groaned under orchids , caviar , turtle soup and golden plate - twenty-two gross old people sat around it guzzling champagne and all sorts of wine ( in spite of prohibition ) , the women all over 5o , all fat , and all except myself nearly naked and hung with ropes of pearls and diamonds . After dinner opera singers came in and yelled horrible music . We came away early ( at midnight ! ) and B.B. actually said he was glad I did not look like other women . " Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they met in 1923 , Nicky , young , shy , uncertain , took a dislike to the older woman , conventionally dressed , jerky in her movements , somehow ill at ease and with an ugly mouth shaped like a savings-box . But the eyes were fine , the voice agreeable . Mrs. Wharton was constantly at I Tatti , and later she and Nicky became friends . The Berensons and Nicky went to stay with Mrs. Wharton at Hyeres , where a terraced garden , too beautiFully kept , corresponded with the exquisitely appointed rooms , but not with the splendid view of the sea . What a hostess she was . Of the four guests three had separate regimes , and each got his , while Mrs. Wharton watched lovingly what they ate and offered more appetizing alternatives . It was the kind of service that fascinated Nicky . Edith 's friendships were possessive and jealous , and her relations were complicated and sometimes dramatic . She suffered from not being treated as an equal by French titled society . The Christmas party at Hyeres included Gaillard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cambridge , a great stickler for ritual and traditional good behavior , which Nicky disliked though it sometimes amused her . A near neighbor was the Viscount Charles de Noailles and his wife Marie-Laure . Mrs. Wharton was fond of Charles ( they shared a passionate interest in gardens and gardening ) , but she could not stand his wife 's friends , avant-garde artists and writers . B.B. grew to like Marie-Laure , and persuaded her to invite Edith and her guests to lunch , and took the invitation to Edith , who received it graciously , but the next morning , evidently persuaded by Gaillard Lapsley , declared that an invitation sent by " word of mouth " was an insult ? it should have been in writing . Edith lived in two worlds , Nicky thought , the inside world where there was no fear of intrusion , and the outside world of which she was constantly afraid and in which she became encased in shyness . In her inside life she was simple , ready to tease her friends and he teased by them . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , grew tired , became peevish and fussy . During the Second World War Nicky and B.B. left I Tatti ( Mary stayed on , grim and fearless ) . The two of them lived in a house Nicky had bought on the heights of Vallombrossa , or sometimes elsewhere , but always in Italy . Once when they were living in the villa of a friend , a young refugee couple arrived , suffering bitterly from the cold , with a seven-months-old baby in a sack on the father 's back . " The baby , " Nicky comments , " is not beautiful , with ears standing off its DECEMBER 24 , 1966 little completely bald head like the handles of a pot , but is well-behaved and merry and intelligent looking . " Nicky returns constantly to her relationship to B.B. He would not have paid much attention to her , she remarks candidly , if she had remained a casual visitor ; it was all due to her getting interested in his work , and gradually becoming indispensable to him , not through any particular ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . When they worked separately the work went well . B.B. would compare himself and Nicky to a nomad and his camel . " She carries me through the worst deserts and allows me to enjoy the enchanting mirages on their horizons . " When B.B. wanted something he gave a kind of howl in his room and stamped his feet , and Nicky heard it , and went up to see what kind of tangle he had got into . It was good to have work that interested one during the war , because the general outlook for most of it got steadily worse . But Berenson never doubted the ultimate Allied victory . He suffered from his diminished power to work and to concentrate , but had much to be grateful for , " keeping his body so light and nimble ( he was then seventy-two ) and his capacity to walk and his immensely varied interests . " Mary became more eccentric and violent as time went on . She grew tired of listening to her husband ; she disliked the female adulation that seemed to surround @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Nicky and B.B. were away , happy to be alone together , Nicky wrote Mary every few days . Their correspondence fills a large part of the book and admirably reveals both women . In spite of her impatience , her lack of consideration for the feelings of others , her prejudices , Mary was warm and generous . When she was dying and had lost the use of hand and eye , she wrote Nicky : " There is no cloud in the thought of you as there is in almost everything else . The end of life , if you remain conscious , is a sort of purgatory in which all your sins and mistakes come crowding upon you , but between you and me there is nothing of the kind ? all is perfectly serene , and I think of you with the deepest love . " She adds that if she died in time , she hoped Nicky would marry B.B. She THE NEW REPUBLIC was almost glad that B.B. should not see her in her pain and weakness . She liked to think that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always stuck together and stuck to Italy . Nicky answers promptly and directly she does n't think she and B.B. would get married " if you should die .
