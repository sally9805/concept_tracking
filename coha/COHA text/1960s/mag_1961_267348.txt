Hardly had the U.S. sat down again at the peace talks in Geneva last week , on the hopeful assumption that a cease-fire was at last in effect in Laos , when the news arrived from Ban Hat Bo , a village near the Mekong River in central Laos . After a heavy mortar barrage that lasted two hours , 1,000 Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese soldiers had attacked to a frenzied blowing of bugles . The Ban Hat Bo garrison fled , along with their five U.S. military advisers . One of them noted bitterly that the Communist assault , with its tooting bugles and the human-wave technique , was " Korea all over again . " <P> Optimists had predicted that the Royal Laotian Army , after it fell back from Padong a week earlier , would now be able to consolidate its hold on stronger positions and stop the Communist drive . The truth was that morale was so badly shattered that the army probably could not win a battle anywhere in Laos . The Pathet Lao claimed to hold " four-fifths of Laos " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed determined to keep gobbling up more while talking peace at Geneva . <P> <P> The one condition that the U.S. had attached to its participation in the 14-nation Geneva conference was an effective ceasefire . But with Ban Hat Bo , the U.S. seemed to have abandoned even that feeble condition , offering the somewhat lame excuse that otherwise " the pace of events might pass us by . " U.S. Delegate Averell Harriman charged that two companies of Viet Minh troops had participated in the earlier attack on Padong , and again asked Russia 's Andrei Gromyko to approve a Canadian plan to dispatch helicopters and light planes to the International Control Commission so that it could carry out its assignment of policing the ceasefire . In the absence of instruction and equipment , the I.C.C . had not budged from its headquarters in Vientiane . In reply , Gromyko was almost insolent . He saw no need for additional equipment for the I.C.C. , and he and Red China 's Foreign Minister Marshal Chen Yi took turns denouncing the U.S. for " provoking " new attacks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other matters . " One can not sit indefinitely on the shores of Lake Geneva counting the swans , " he complained . <P> The slight hope that still remained for some agreement rested on a weekend meeting between the key Laotian princes in Zurich . Up from Nice , where he has been sunning himself , came the U.S. 's favorite Premier , Prince Boun Oum . From Geneva , looking as relaxed as a pair of tourists , came Russia 's favorite Premier , " neutralist " Prince Souvanna Phouma , and his brother , " Red Prince " Souphanou-vong , who commands the Pathet Lao . Prince Souvanna greeted his rival warmly and talked in friendly style about getting together on a " broad-based coalition government . " The way things were going back home , one diplomat cracked , " Boun Oum will be lucky to get the Education Ministry . " After two days , about the only thing the princes could get together on was that they would keep amiable King Savang Vatthana as a figurehead monarch . " The King is sacred to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
