A chorus line of 36 barelegged beauties on skates swirled in synchronized precision over the ice rink in Indianapolis ' State Fairgrounds Coliseum . They wore sequined leotards and yellow-feathered headdresses , and they dipped and swooped together to the ricky-tick tempo of an 18-piece band playing Dixieland . Fireworks sparked near the roof girders , and a family-trade crowd of 4,320 oohed and aahed . This was the finale of the Holiday on Ice show 's first night in Indianapolis-a Mardi Gras production number . <P> Before it ended , an explosion thundered through the auditorium . A 30-ft. wall of flame shot over a section of box seats and rinkside folding chairs . In an instant , the rink was littered with enormous chunks of concrete , shredded programs , crumpled popcorn boxes , splintered seats , twisted steel-and dozens of limp or painfully writhing bodies that lay in puddles of blood spreading over the ice . It took a moment for the horror to register . Then the gay chorus line broke in a scramble of skate blades and screams . A woman in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the show ! It 's got to be ! It 's got to be ! " The band continued to play Dixieland . <P> The explosion , from a leaking gas tank in a commissary storeroom beneath the audience , had blasted a sheet of flame up through 128 of the Coliseum 's choicest box seats , catapulting men and women-many still in their seats-in blazing arcs through the air . Slabs of concrete the size of small cars went up 50 ft. , then slammed down on a crowded section of folding chairs below the box seats , crushing dozens and trapping many more in tons of debris . <P> Bleeding or dazed , some people wandered aimlessly out of the Coliseum . Some fled wildly across the ice , slipping and skidding as they tried to escape . Others clawed with their bare hands to drag away 500-lb. blocks of concrete that pinned people in the wreckage . The auditorium , brilliantly illuminated by spotlights , echoed with screams of the injured-some lying helplessly trapped beneath bodies of the dead . A man walked about asking everyone he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my kids ? " <P> Within minutes , a call went out for every ambulance within miles . Hospitals called in off-duty personnel . Hundreds of rescue workers descended on the Coliseum . Auto wreckers and a construction crane rumbled onto the ice rink , began lifting blocks of concrete to free the dead and the injured . Doctors and nurses , their clothing streaked with dried blood , worked feverishly . Others organized a makeshift morgue on the rink . Beneath gay red and green Chinese lanterns left over from the finale , men laid bodies on boards , covered them with blankets , tarpaulins and overcoats , and marked each with a curt description such as , " Young girl , sandy hair , blue eyes . Unidentified . " <P> At week 's end , the toll stood at 66 dead , 400 injured . <P> . . .
