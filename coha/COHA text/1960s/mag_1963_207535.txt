While all eyes are on the pace of car sales in the nation 's auto showrooms ( April set another monthly record ) , 1963 is also proving a greenbacked year for the men who preside over the dusty , sunbaked used-car lots . Detroit watches used-car sales as closely as new-model sales in judging how long the auto boom can continue . The signs are encouraging : about four used cars are now being sold for every three new ones , and at least 13 million used cars will probably be sold in 1963 . While used-car dealers can usually sell a " cream puff " - the car in good condition with a good paint job-they are doing so well now that many find little trouble in unloading the beat-up dogs . Boost from Below . The horse-trading system of selling new cars in the U.S. makes the used car a vital factor in new-car sales : in 74% of all new-car sales the dealer takes a used car as a trade-in . Bargaining is so hard that the dealer usually makes no profit until he sells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he understandably lowers the amount he will allow a customer on a trade-in . This , in effect , raises the price of the new car , and too much scaling down of prices can slam the brakes on any auto boom . There is , in fact , a school of thought in Detroit that argues that it all moves in cycles : as new-car sales increase , trade-ins bring in more used cars until the lots become clogged and prices begin to drop to move them . No one really knows at what point today 's used-car market will be saturated . Year after year , used-car sales have steadily climbed : 1962 's sales of 11.8 million were 13% over 1961 , and this year 's estimates reckon on another 10% gain . The increase in sales comes mostly from the bottom of the market-from teen-agers now reaching driving age , who grab up the six-and seven-year-old cars . A sale to one of them enables the previous owner to buy a newer used car for himself , so the effects continue right up the line to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car a used one . Good Until August . Because of the bigger demand for used cars , there are fewer bargains to be had . Prices are up slightly from a year ago even though there are more cars for sale , and the hottest used seller is the car that also leads the new-auto field : Chevrolet . Volkswagen also ranks high as a used car ; last week at a wholesale auto auction , the place where the trade sets its prices , a 1960 VW carried a wholesale price of $1,080 v. $1,000 for a 1960 Ford Galaxie that when new cost $1,000 more than the VW . Because a bright red used car of any make attracts attention to the lot , it is worth $200 more than a car of any other color ; and in the South , air conditioning can add up to $250 to the car 's price v. only $50 in the North . The betting in Detroit is that used cars will keep on supporting new-car sales right through August . Used-car inventories now stand at a healthy 25-day supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . After , August , the 1964s will come out and suddenly make used cars out of all the 1963s on the road-and then begins another year , and another game .
