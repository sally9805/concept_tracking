Dinner at Eight has cooled . No line in this 34-year-old George S. Kaufman-Edna Ferber comedy is more than tepidly amusing . What with social changes and altered tastes , a faint , distant aroma of the ' 30s clings to the play-and astonishingly little else . <P> The comedy has been exhumed , but it resists revival . In that bygone era of playmaking , there was a vogue for entangling a group of unrelated characters on the crossed-up switchboard of life , whether in a hotel ( Grand Hotel ) , or an ocean liner ( Outward Bound ) , or a theatrical club full of struggling ingenues ( Stage Door ) . This Dinner party is being given for a pair of British nabobs , Lord and Lady Ferncliffe-themselves archaic forms of snobbism - who do not show up . The host is Walter Pidgeon , who suffers from past heartburns ( Arlene Francis ) , present heart seizures and a failing family shipping line . The guests include an uncouth Montana mining shark ( Robert Burr ) who is secretly buying up the shipping line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiffin , a diaphanous parody of Jean Harlow , who plays with her doctor ( Jeffrey Lynn ) . The hostess ( June Havoc ) is in a canary-twittering dither because she has lost her lobster aspic in a scuffle of criminal passion between the butler and the chauffeur over the upstairs maid . The omnipresence of servants gives the play the air of a planet quite unlike Earth . <P> There are eight scenes in the first two acts , and one of life 's little ironies drops like a shoe with each curtain , but Director Tyrone Guthrie 's slavish devotion to Kaufman and Ferber 's studied contrivances robs the Dinner of all relish before it is served . <P> Breadline , anyone ?
