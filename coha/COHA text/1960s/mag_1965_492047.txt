On April 12 , 1945 , Eleanor Roosevelt sent a message to her four sons in the armed forces . " He did his job to the end as he would want you to do , " she said . " Bless you all . " James Roosevelt , a colonel in the Marine Corps , re  --  ceived the message and the news of his father 's death on Leyte Island in the Philippines . Elliott Roosevelt , a brig  --  adier general in the Air Force , was in the European theater of war . Franklin Jr . and John were both with the Navy in the Pacific . Franklin in command of a destroyer escort , and John serving aboard the aircraft carrier Hornet . Only Anna , the Roosevelts ' daughter , was in the United States . Shewas with her mother at the White House when the tragic news came from Warm Springs , Ga. , that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was dead of a cerebral hemorrhage . It was the end of an era . The five Roosevelt children who experienced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently shared some of their mem  --  ories with CBS NEWS . Excerpts from those interviews were used on my evening news program . What follows are further reminiscences from the five living persons who were closest to the remarkable man who was the 32nd President of the United States . WALTER CRoNKITE When Franklin 0 . Roost-reit was elected to the presidency in 1932 , Franklin and John , the younger sons , were students at Groton Preparatory Schaal . Franklin . in his last year , was 18 John was 16 . The three older children , Anna , James and Elliott , spent that first presidential election night with their father . Elliott was 32 . ELLIOTT : On election night in 1932 they had the ticker tape and the telephone set up in one room , and all the operators and the principal workers were gathered around that room . For a long period of time father stayed out of the room , but as the returns started to really come in , and it became apparent that he was moving ahead in the early stages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , and then he set up charts and he followed each state , each county in the United States , with the greatest of interest , and he kept cautioning all of the people around : " Now , do n't get excited ; this can change . " But it did n't change , so after a while , I 'd say about midnight or 12:30 , he felt that the election was really won , and , of course , that called for a lot of backslapping and a great deal of pleasant celebrating , and I think he stayed up until about three o'clock that night . When he went to bed , he was completely sure that he had won the election because by that time most of the major cities in California , which were the last ones to be heard from , had come in . F.D.R. JR. : We were going to play our last big football game the next day , and I was on the football team , so 1 talked to him about a quarter of nine on election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and he said , " Well . I think it looks pretty good , I think that we 're going to win . " And so 1 went to bed election night quite satisfied that all was well . I woke up the next morning and found out that my father had been elected by a landslide and , I might add a postscript , we won that game . ELLIOTT : In every election he sat with the newsmen who were cover  --  ing his campaign , and they all named the number of states they thought he would carry . I remember very c ' early that he won the first election bet by naming the number of states he would carry right on the nose . JOHN : I remember the following March 4 . The rector of Groton , Dr. Peabody , made a big exception . He permitted the sixth form to go down to father 's inauguration . Right after that , as you 'll remember , we had the closing of the banks and the bank holiday , and I remember motherhav  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin Jr . and I could get back to school from the inauguration . I think father was tremendously confident of himself . He had ideas . During the early days of his illness , when he first had polio , he had time to do a lot of reading and a lot of studying . He loved history . And father was completely confident that he could alleviate the distress which many of our fellow citizens were undergoing at the time . Anna , at 25. moved into the White House with her two children , Sistie , 5 , and Maxie , 2 . James , the eldest son , was 25 when F.D.R. became President . He left the insurance busi  --  ness to help his father a ! the White House . JAMES : I think 1 started out in a sort of informal way through the first term , and then during the cam  --  paign in 1936 , 1 was with him almost constantly , and that was rather a successful campaign , and I think father got the idea it 'd be kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election , we went down MEMORIES OF F. D.R to South America . on what was ! mown as the goodwill or Good Neighbor policy tour . And everything went so satisfactorily that at the end of it fa  --  ther asked me if I would mind moving down to Washington . getting a house and bringing my family , and being one of his secretaries . Well , my mother was rather violently opposed to this . She thought it would be very widely criti  --  cized . But father was a little stubborn , you know , and when he got an idea that he wanted something , particularly if it was something personal . he usually went ahead with it , in spite of every  --  thing . So finally he convinced me that it was the right thing to do . and 1 came down and worked in the White House . It was a difficult position , because natu  --  rally people would resent being told that they could n't see father . but they had to see me . There were some rather crusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get . But little by little things worked out , and I think that during those periods when father would give me special work , such as coordinating the independent agencies . things worked out fairly well , and the original criticism more or less died down . ANNA : It could be very difficult . I know some of my brothers have said they re  --  member definitely resenting having to make appointments to see father . You think you ought to be able to see your male parent when you would like to see him . But I think that as you mature you learn and have to learn that your father belongs to the people whom he serves as a public servant .. It 's hard to take sometimes , but you learn . FRANKLIN : We used to kid him , and say , " Well , I suppose I need an appoint  --  ment to sue you. - This was n't exactly true . We could always see him before dinner in the evening . He would go in and sit up in bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a massage on h is legs . and he 'd have all the evening pa  --  pers spread out on the bed . He was an omnivorous reader of newspapers , just as Jack Kennedy was . And we would go in there , and we would talk about things that were happening in the world and in the country . Sometimes we would talk about our own personal problems . And he was always very interested , and very warm about the relationship be  --  tween himself and his family . He was a great family man . JAMES : He made it very clear to me right in the beginning of my  --  should I say  --  secretaryship that we must main  --  tain during the business part of the day a completely business attitude , and I would refer to him as Mr. President when 1 walked in and had something to say to him , or was introducing some  --  body to him . And there was very little of what you might call camaraderie during the business part of the day . Now , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool or relaxing , even though we might be talking busi  --  ness , then it was not so official . This was , I think , a good way to be . because you could n't really have a father-son relationship in carrying out business . But there were times when he would be bawling me out because something had n't been done just the way he wanted , when I would say to myself . " Now , wait a minute . I 'm your son . You do n't have to be quite as rough as that with me " But you learn to take those things . even though they are sometimes hard to take . ELLIOTT : The presidency invariably places restrictions on families staying close together , but I feel that both my mother and my father made great efforts to keep the family a close-knit unit . In the case of my father , he went to tremen  --  dous lengths to keep close contacts through telephone calls and letters . As busy as he was . he was able to write let  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in other parts of the country as often as once or twice a month and , further than that , if there were any problems within the family , he would immediately call up . When we were in Washington . he made a point of postponing appoint  --  ments and inviting whatever child happened to be there to come and have lunch with him at his desk in his office . F.b.R . JR. : We tried to write to him once a week or once every ten days ; usually when exciting things happened . He would write back , sometimes in longhand , just a quickly scribbled note , or sometimes he would dictate to Mar  --  guerite LeHand ' ? we always called her Missy  --  his private secretary who was with him from 1920 until she died in 1944 . We carried on a sort of erratic correspondence , not a regular one at all . My mother was much the greatest let  --  ter writer in the family and she wrote us very regularly . She 'd always give us news from the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family newspaper . JAMES : We did n't all really live in the White House . But on frequent occa  --  sions we would all be there for a visit , and when we all got together , it was probably as noisy as the White House has ever been . One of the great things about the White House is that the sec  --  ond floor really is n't like a museum . This is a family home , and this is where the family feels relaxed , not under pub  --  lic scrutiny . I do n't think , for instance , we would have enjoyed having the pub  --  lic present for one tremendous pillow-light night that I remember we had . There were a good many feathers bro  --  ken , and a lot of cleanup work to do af ter-ward. and a few bruised feelings . But these kinds of things . I think , make the White House a perfectly normal home to live in when you get above the first floor . ELLIOTT : I remember that father always was very easygoing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , I remember one time when my uncle Hall ' Eleanor Rooseve/ t 's brother ' was attending a very formal white-tie dinner in the main dining room and he was suddenly hit with the urge to give a horse bite on the knee of father 's per  --  sonal secretary , Miss LeHand . Horse bite is when you grab hold of the knee and make somebody jump all of a sud  --  den , which she did , and she let out a yelp . Father leaned down the table and said . " Hall , this is not the time or place for that sort of tomfoolery . " ANNA : He was a wonderful grandfather . I think he and my mother both had a favorite saying which was , " You can only angle for a shot would have been from straight ahead , and father said , " Now , over on this side , you put your aide , " and then he said , " I 'll put my son Jimmy in the front seat right next to your aide , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get it if anybody aimed at you . " Well . I thought he was joking . He was n't jok  --  ing at all . He was very serious about it . And I can assure you in that parade I watched the crowd more closely than they 've ever been watched before , ELLIOTT : Father never had even in the wartime years the type of security which we deem necessary for our President to  --  day . He used to resent having a large number of Secret Service men around him when he was out in public . He did not object to one man being close at hand at all times , but when he was re  --  laxing , and he was out , maybe cam  --  paigning , he used to like to have the people able to come up close to him . Prior to World War II he had very little security . When World War 11 came along , there were quite a lot of sub  --  versive agents here in this country , and security did tighten a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer part of the property with Secret Service posts and with soldiers . But still . in his personal life , he resented highly having too many Secret Service men right up next to him . JOHN : Father used to get a great deal of relaxation by driving his Ford touring car , which is presently in the library at Hyde Park . and he used to give the Secret Service its because they had a great big 16-cylinder Cadillac with which they tried to follow father on some of those wood roads , and , of course , he could get through with his Ford , but the Cadillac of the Secret Service would get bogged down . He used to have more fun just evading and losing the Secret Service . Finally they got smart and they got a Ford too . F.D.R. JR. : He 'd drive around those corners , and sometimes we were never sure that he was going to make it . think he scared the King and Queen of Great Britain ) to death in 1939 , when he took them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After they got through that ride , we had the famous hot-dog picnic . He loved hot dogs and hamburgers . He loved going on picnics . He knew every big hilltop in Dutchess County , and he 'd always take us to a new one if he knew about it . He had a few favorites that we 'd go back to . But he loved the long view that you would get , and the beautiful scenery that Dutchess County is famous for . JOHN : I remember when the late King George and Queen Elizabeth came for a night , the famous time of the hot-dog picnic up on the top of the hill . The King and Queen were delayed getting here , and when they came in , my father asked the King if he would like a cock  --  tail , and added , " Of course , my mother thinks that you should have a cup of tea . " The King said , " You know . that sounds very much like my mother . " He had a cocktail . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in Hyde Park . JOHN : I always remember this place nut for the people that came to visit my father and my mother and my grandmother , but really as a home , be  --  cause this was where we grew up with the horses and with the dogs and tennis . and this was our home . I know that my grandmother always used to complain and tell all of our visitors that my father learned his bad language from me , and I learned mine in the stable . ANNA : As a father , he could be very stern , but at the same time , I think he was much more apt to leave the disci  --  pline to the female members of the family . That was my mother and my grandmother  --  I think they were the disciplinarians in the family , much more than father . JOHN : Well , of course , mother always had the problem of getting us off to school , getting us enough clothes so that when we were in boarding school we had all the necessities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran the New York house and Campobello . I think that in later years , from the time father went actively into public life , after polio had hit , he used mother as his legs , eyes and ears to go out and find out about certain situations or get sonic information . Now , he probably did n't always agree with her conclusions , but this was a viewpoint that was very helpful to father . ELLIOTT : I think what he did was to rec  --  ognize the fact that my mother could gad around the country very easily , and that what she saw was of tremendous value . He valued her reports to him . The Roosevelt sons often served flair father as support ; a firm right arm to lean upon as he walked . F.D.R. JR. : You were very conscious that you had to keep your arm stiff . He did lean heavily on your arm , and , of course , he had a cane in his other hand , and braces up to his hips . But nobody was really conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was MEMORIES OF F D. R paralyzed from the waist down , with very limited movement of his legs . He never seemed to pay attention to it . He 'd walk on and off a train by a ramp . He 'd get in and out of a car by getting onto the jump seat first . He handled his legs with his hands by lift  --  ing them up . So it all seemed very natural . ANNA : The Happy Warrior speech pin 19241 was the first speech  --  the first time he had made a public appear  --  ance of this kind since he 'd been paralyzed . It was a terrific effort , be  --  cause in those days bracesfor a para  --  lytic were , I believe , made of iron . Naturally there was a lot of conversa  --  tion about it at home , beforehand : Was he going to be able to walk the distance between where his chair was and where the podium was ? It was discussed . but not in terms of what the physical strain would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner by my grandmother . who was always apprehensive about any  --  thing that he did , but not by the rest of us . We just had a natural confidence that he gave us . If he was going to do it , he could do it . F.D.R. JR. : He did so many things . He even rode a horse when he was down in Warm Springs . Georgia . He had good enough balance . Of course . he never did get out of a walk . but he rode occasionally , even at Hyde Park . And he was able to sail . I remember we went cruising along the Maine coast two summers , in 1933 and again in 1936 . JOHN : One of the things we all remem  --  ber so well are the cruises we made with father on the , ' Imbrrjack , and then on the Savanna . and some of the great tirnis that we had . He was completely relaxed . I remember one time on the Maine coast . We were going into Campobello. and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an escort . and father just decided , because he knew the waters and the tides and the whole coast so well , he decided to just take off . We took off in the fog , and I 'm afraid the poor skipper of that destroyer almost died . But father knew where he was going . and how he was going to get there . The skipper , I think , had a few very had moments . F.D.R. JR. : I remember him after he was stricken with polio and after the strength came hack to his shoulders and arms and the upper part of his body . My brother John and I were , I suppose , seven and eight or nine , and we used to roughhouse on the floor of the library of the house in New York . Suddenly his legs would give way . but it never both  --  ered him . He had tremendous strength in his arms and his shoulders . I remem  --  ber Jack Dempsey saying to him one time that if he 'd had the strength that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Gene Tunney . ANNA : I know that many people have said that father would not have been the humanitarian that he was if he had nut had polio . I do n't believe this . If you read his record as a state senator in Albany and his record later in Wash  --  ington , you realize that he had all these terrific interests in people and in what happened to people long before he had polio . But I do believe having polio and suddenly realizing all the things that you could never do again would give you the time to concentrate on thing-syou had n't had time to concentrate on be  --  fore ; to develop your philosophy and your goals and plans . ELLIOTT ; He sharpened his perceptions tremendously after his illness , and he became a voracious reader . As you know , he was able to read a 300- or 400-page book and recite any para  --  graph from any page that you ques  --  tioned him about months and months later . He recited verbatim , because he could read that book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographic mind . JOHN : He used to love to work on his stamps , and that gave him a great deal of relaxation . He was quite a historian , and he loved not only history but geography , and I think that through his stamps he developed curiosity . If he 'd get a stamp from some out-of-the-way place , he 'd want to know all about that place . John recalled two qualities that helped his father carry the load of the presi  --  dency during a depression and a war . JOHN : Father had a marvelous ability . He could lie down and take a nap when  --  ever he went to bed . I know he used to read a detective story or parts of one , but he had no trouble in sleeping . He could put things out of his mind and get a complete rest . Another reason he could carry such a load was that he could always laugh . I remember one time when the family was living in Hyde Park , and father had just been elected President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting us . My brother Frank and I used to go out and swipe his motor  --  cycle , and he complained bitterly to father that those two miserable brats were swiping state-police motorcycles , and father turned to him and said , " Welt. if you 're damned fool enough to leave the keys in it , then you deserve to have your motorcycle stolen. - Fa  --  ther could always laugh , and he could always kid people . ELLIOTT : IL was my impression that he always was talking to me and to other members of the family of the time when he would get through with the office of the presidency and what he was going to do with his time when he got out of the White House . He looked forward to that day tremendously , but it led to a certain amount of , shall we say , em  --  barrassment to me on one occasion . I was so certain that he was n't going to run for a third term that I came out very vociferously for John Nance Gar  --  ner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that summer that he would accept the third-term nomina  --  tion . He had not discussed a third term at all . In fact , I have at home the front page of the New York World of 1912 in which there is an editorial decrying Roosevelt seeking the third term . This was Theodore Roosevelt seeking a third term on the Bull Moose ticket , and my mother sent it to my father after he announced that he was going to seek a third term in 1940 . I think the thing that he would have liked to du was to write . He wanted to do a popular-style history of the United States Navy , and he also wanted to write a biography of John Paul Jones . He had made many notes . He started on these books back in the ' 20 's when he had polio , and he kept those notes all the way through his term of office as President , and f know that he intended to write those books . He also wanted to travel . He wanted to go as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidents . But to write and to ' rare ' were dreams . The era was drawing to an end . F.D.R. JR. : I saw hint over Christmas of 1943. when I returned from the IvIedi  --  s terranean with a very badly damaged destroyer . He was in very good health . You could see that being Commander in Chief during the war was a tremen  --  dous strain . But he had all of his facul  --  ties and full vigor . I would say he was considerably more serious than he had been before I first went into service in early 1941 , almost a year before Pearl Harbor . He had much less time for re  --  laxation. even for his stamp collection . ANNA : Many people have said to me . " Why did n't you say anything ; you must have known his health was fail  --  ing . " And the only thing I can say is I never felt his health was failing . I was with him constantly the last year and a half that he lived . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him were more than most people of a very young age could stand : the big Depression when he first went into the White House . and then the war right on top of that . I felt that the burdens were such that he needed a little hit more rest from time to time , and that was why I decided to work with him and see what little things l could take off his shoulders , little details that he . not being able to run around , could n't do . That was how I came to go with him to Yalta . But I do n't think any of us realized . There was no lime for him to swim during those four years . so that he was n't able to take good care of him  --  self . But I do n't think any of us felt that he was really failing in health . James saw him at his last inauguration . JAMES : I was really very distressed , and I noted , for instance , that when he went out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inaugural ad  --  dress , he seemed very frail , and I tried to make him wear a cape ... a coat . And he shook it . off in a manner that made me know that he was very tense . And then when we came back to the White House after the speech , I noticed that he just was n't well , and he said to me . " I do n't know if I can make the reception . " And that was the first time that he 'd even indicated to me that he was uncertain of his physical ability . So , I immediately went to Doctor McIntire ) Adm . Ross T. McIntire , White House physician and to a num  --  ber of other people and they tried to reassure me , and I then went to see a Lieutenant Commander George Fox who was part of the medical staff and who was an old friend of mine . I put to him as straight as I could , and asked him if everything was all right . And he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told . and I do n't want to be quoted . but you 'd better make the most of the few hours that you 'll have now with your father , because you may never see him again . " So . I was prepared , of course , from that remark . but I was deeply disturbed because some people were telling me he was line . and I could see that he was not well . and this nat urally made the next few months very ' trying . I went back overseas the next morning , and that was the last time that I saw him alive . ANNA : When he went to Warm Springs on the last trip , he used to call me every night , when he thought I was going to bed , to ask how my younger son was . and always to tell me stories with roars of laughter as to what he was going to do . The last night before he died he was planning to be at a big barbecue and he was telling me all about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was actually after he died . ly destroyer sank an enemy submarine off Mindoro in the Philippines , and it happened on the night of his birthday . January 30 , 1945 . So . I wrote him a brief note and said , " If you ask Ad  --  miral King ' chief of staff of the Navy for battle report number so and so . I think you will find that my ship has given you one of the most unusual birth  --  day presents that any President ever had , and from a son . " After he died , 1 got the note from him addressed to the commanding officer and officers and men of the Uleert H. , Hoare . congratu  --  lating us on sinking this enemy sub  --  marine , and agreeing that this was the most unusual birthday present he had ever received . We put the leiter near the galley where the sailors like to con  --  gregate , and 1 believe that it was there until the ship was put out of commis  --  sion . That was the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
