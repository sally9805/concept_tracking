Until they opened a museum in the summer of 1862 , the burghers of Haarlem in The Netherlands never fully realized the extent of their riches . There had been paintings in various public buildings all over town , but now they were assembled under one roof , and the effect was dazzling . The museum was appropriately named for the great 17th century master Frans Hals , for it was his work that towered over everything else . <P> Last week , in celebration of its centennial , the museum had on view the largest exhibition of Hals paintings ever held . Eleven of the canvases belonged to Haarlem ; the rest came from as far away as the State Museum of Odessa and the University of Illinois in Urbana . Queen Elizabeth of England and Mrs. Efrem Zimbalist of Philadelphia each sent a painting ; the Earl of Radnor and the King of Sweden sent two apiece . <P> Stodgy But Vital . Frans Hals , one of the finest of portrait painters , recorded an era of Dutchmen who , aside from a few laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty stodgy lot . Yet Hals gave them a vitality that still jumps from the canvas . Hals never worked from sketches ; he drew simply and directly with his brush , building his invariably harmonious compositions almost by instinct . He wasted no time on frills or dramatics ; his presentation was straightforward , sometimes even stark . Yet his brush was so light and fluid that even when his subjects appear in a void , with nothing stirring about them , they themselves seem about to move or speak . <P> Hals usually preferred to let his subjects stand or sit on an empty stage with only their personalities-a tightness of the lip , a squint of the eyes , a proud thrust of the head-constituting the action . His Married Couple ( see color ) was one of the exceptions . The two young people seem to have flung themselves into their coy positions only a moment ago , and they look as if they might just as hurriedly get up to go on about their business . The manicured landscape in the background is strangely sentimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was using some fashionable symbology . A garden was the traditional home of Venus ; the peacocks may refer to Juno , the protectress of marriage , and the ivy behind the young woman could be the symbol of fidelity . <P> Alone But Linked . Though few men could catch so well the character of an individual , Hals was also the master of the group portrait . With him , all the contrived clumsiness of his predecessors vanished . His Banquet of Officers of the St. Joris-Doelen is so composed that while each man retains his individuality , he is linked by gesture and expression to the whole . The seated figure in the foreground provides a dash of humor : he holds his glass upside down to show he is out of wine . In 1621 a city ordinance ruled that these banquets should not last more than three or four days . Previously , they tended to go on for a week . <P> The solid citizens that Hals painted were a prosperous lot , but Hals himself , the father of perhaps a dozen children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in existence concerning his personal life are court records of suits filed by creditors . Hals was so poor that the city had to provide him with three cartloads of turf each year for fuel , and it also paid for his grave . He was buried in 1666 at a cost of four florins ( $1.50 ) . His paintings on exhibition in Haarlem last week were insured for $25 million .
