The testing hour for Fidel Castro was drawing near . <P> At 6:25 a.m . Saturday , two B-26 light bombers roared in from the sea toward Havana , dropped to low level and started their bomb runs . One plane worked over Castro 's Air Force Base at San Antonio de los Baos , 20 miles southwest of the capital . The other attacked Havana 's Camp Liberty , Castro 's main military headquarters . Darting through a curtain of antiaircraft fire , the B-26 swept over the camp toggling bombs , banked around for a rocket attack , then finished off by a strafing run with eight .50-cal. machine guns . As smoke from exploding ammo dumps and burning buildings spread over Castro 's GHQ , radio reports crackled in of a similar B-26 raid on the military airport at Santiago , 460 miles away on the eastern end of the island . <P> <P> Shortly thereafter , a B-26 with Cuban Air Force markings limped into Miami International Airport , one engine feathered , its engine nacelles nicked by bullets . A second B26 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a bed of fire-preventing foam at the U.S. Naval Air Station at Key West . A third reportedly landed in Jamaica . The crewmen , all Cubans , were whisked away before reporters could ask questions . One pilot , who finally told an elaborate story of his day 's work , asked not to be named , to protect his family in Cuba . <P> Prelude to Invasion ? As the news hit the wires , Jos Mir Cardona , head of the exile Revolutionary Council in Manhattan , proclaimed the attack a last salute to Fidel Castro by defecting members of the Cuban Air Force . " Before flying their planes towards freedom , these true revolutionaries attempted to destroy as many Castro military planes as possible . " The well-coordinated , professionally executed mission was known to the council beforehand , said Mir Cardona . " We have been in contact with , and have encouraged these brave pilots . " He added that " military security " prevented further explanation . <P> Castro accused the U.S. of staging the attack , raged that it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperialists . " Ral Roa , Castro 's U.N . delegate , popped up to demand that the General Assembly consider the anti-U.S . charges immediately , was eagerly backed by the Soviet Union . Adlai Stevenson , for the U.S. , denied all , and cited the Cuban markings on the planes . <P> All week Castro 's Cubans had been excited by the possibility of an imminent showdown . They could find support for their fears on Page One of the New York Times , which reported from Florida troop-laden aircraft roaring off into the night , exiled Cuban doctors called to service on a hospital ship standing by off the coast , launches making nightly runs to Cuba with explosives and saboteurs . Training groups of exiles were reported breaking up at a mysterious jungle-warfare camp in the Louisiana bayous , at a sabotage school near Houston , at a string of seven camps between Guatemala and Panama . Between 3,000 and 5,000 anti-Castro Cubans-some reports said 7,000-awaited the signal .                  @ @ @
