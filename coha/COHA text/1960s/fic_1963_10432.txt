Alton . I had made a vow during the day to protect my father , and these two students consuming his time were the first enemies I had encountered . One was Deifendorf , the other was Judy Lengel . Deifendorf was speaking . " I can see shop and typing and like that , Mr. Caldwell , " he said , " but for somebody like me who 's not going on to college or anything , I do n't see the point of memorizing lists of animalsthat 've been dead a million years . " " There is no point , " my father said . " You are two hundred per cent right : who cares about dead animals ? If they 're dead , let ' em lie ; that 's my motto . They depress the hell out of me . But that 's what they give me to teach and I 'm going to teach it to you until it kills me . It 's either you or me , Deifendorf , and if you do n't get rid of those jitters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; I 'll strangle you with my bare hands if I have to . I 'm up here fighting for my life . I have a wife and a kid and an old man to feed . I 'm just like you are ; I 'd rather be out walking the streets . I feel sorry for you ; I know how you 're suffering . " I laughed by the window ; it was my way of attacking Deifendorf . I felt him clinging to my father , sucking the strength from him . That was the way of the cruel children . An hour after they had goaded him to the point of frenzy ( flecks of foam would actually appear in the corners of his mouth and his eyes would become like tiny raw diamonds ) , they would show up in his room , anxious to seek advice , make confessions , be reassured . And the instant they had left his companythey would mock him again . I kept my back turned on the sickening duet . From my father 's windows I overlooked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheerleaders rehearsed , and the tennis courts and the line of horsechestnut trees marking the poorhouse lane and , beyond everything , Mt . Alton , a humped blue horizon scarred by a gravel pit . A trolley car stuffed with Alton shoppers came sparking and swaying up the line . Some of the students who lived toward Alton were bunched at the stop , waiting for this trolley 's mate to come down the pike . Down on the cement walks leading from the girls ' exit along the side of the building  --  I had to touch my nose to the icy glass to see this sharply down  --  girls , foreshortenedinto patches of plaid , fur , books , and wool , walked in pairs and trios home together . Frozen breath flew from their mouths . What they said I could not hear . I looked for Penny among them . I had avoided her all day , because to draw near to her seemed a desertion of my parents , whose need for me had mysteriously , solemnly deepened. " . . . the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His voice scratched . His voice was queerly feeble , disassociated from his emphatic , athletic body . I had often seen Deifendorf naked in the locker room . He had stumpy legs woolly with sandy fur and a huge rubbery torso and sloping shining shouldersand very long arms culminating in red scoop-shaped hands . He was a swimmer . " That 's right , you 're not , you 're not the only one , " my father told him . " But on the whole , Deifendorf , I 'd say you 're the worst . I 'd say you 're the itchiest kid I have on my hands this year . " He made this estimate dispassionately . There were things  --  itchiness , intelligence , athletic ability  --  that his years of teaching had given him absolute pitch in gauging . No Penny had popped up among the girls below . Behindp102me , the quality of Deifendorf 's silence seemed baffled and even hurt . He had a vulnerable side . He loved my father . It pains me to admit it , but there existed between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I resented it . I resentedhow lavishly my father outpoured himself before the boy , as if somewhere in all this nonsense there might be the healing drop . " The Founding Fathers , " he explained , " in their wisdom decided that children were an unnatural strain on parents . So they provided jails called schools , equipped with tortures called an education . School is where you go between when your parents ca n't take you and industry ca n't take you . I am a paid keeper of Society 's unusables  --  the lame , the halt , the insane , and the ignorant . The only incentive I can give you , kid , to behave yourself is this : if you do n't buckle down and learn something , you 'll be as dumb as I am , and you 'll have to teach school to earn a living . When the Depression hit me in ' 31 , I had nothing . I knew nothing . God had taken care of me all my life so I was unemployable . So out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got me a job teaching . I do n't wish it on you , kid . Even though you 're my worst enemy I do n't wish it on you . " I was staring , ears warm , toward Mt . Alton . As if through an imperfection in the glass I looked around a corner of time and foresaw , fantastically , that Deifendorf would teach . And so it was to be . Fourteen years later , I went home and on an Alton side-street met Deifendorf in a saggy brown suit from whose breast pocket the pencils and pens thrust as from my father 's pocket in the old forgotten days . Deifendorf had gone fat and his hairline had receded , but it was he . He asked me , dared in all seriousness to ask me , an authentic second-rate abstract ex/pressionist living in an East Twenty-third Street loft with a Negro mistress , me , if I was ever going to teach . I told him No . He told me , his pale dull eyes shelled in seriousness , " Pete , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about teaching . It 's rough , ' he 'd say , but you ca n't beat it for the satisfaction you get . ' Now I 'm teaching myself , I see what he meant . A great man , your Dad . Did you know that ? " And now in his weak and scratchy whine of a voice he began to tell my father something of the sort . " I ai n't no enemy , Mr. Caldwell . I like you . All the kids like you . " " That 's my trouble , Deifendorf . That 's the worst thing can happen to a public school teacher . I do n't want you to like me . All I want from you is to sit still under me for fifty-five minutesa day five days a week . When you walk into my room , Deifendorf , I want you to be stiff with fear . Caldwell the KidKiller ; that 's how I want you to think of me . Brrouh ! " I turned from the window and laughed , determined to interrupt . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunched toward each other like conspirators . My father looked sallow and nauseated , his temples glazed and hollow ; the top of his desk was littered with papers and tin-jawed binders and paperweights like half-metamorphosed toads . Deifendorf had stolen his strength ; teaching was sapping him . I saw this helplessly . I saw helplessly in the smirk on Deify 's face that from my father 's whirl of words he had gathered a sense of superiority , a sense of being , in comparison with this addled and vehement shipwreck of a man , young , clean , sleek , clear-headed , well-coordinated , and invincible . My father , embarrassed by my angry witnessing , changed the subject . " Be at the Y by 6:30 , " he told Deifendorf curtly.  |p104There  was a swimming meet this evening and Zimmerman was on the team . " We 'll dunk ' em for ya , Mr. Caldwell , " Deifendorf promised . " They 'll be cocky and ripe for an upset . " Our swimming team had not won a meet all season : Olinger was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public pool , and the poorhouse dam 's bottom was lined with broken bottles . My father was , by one of those weird strokes whereby Zimmerman kept the faculty in a malleable flux of confusion , the team 's coach , though his hernia prevented him from ever going into the water . " Do your best is all we can do , " my father said . " You ca n't walk on water . " I believe now that my father wanted this last statement to be contradicted , but none of the three others of us in the room saw the need . Judy Lengel was the third student in the room . My father 's view of her was that her father bullied her beyond the limit of her mental abilities . I doubted this ; in my opinion Judy was just a girl who being neither pretty nor bright had spitefully developed a petty ambitiousness with which she tormented the gullible teachers like my father . She seized the silence to say , " Mr. Caldwell , I was wondering about that quiz tomorrow  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was attempting to leave , sated . He all but belched as he got up from his chair . My father asked him , " Deify , how arc you and cigarettes ? If anybody reports you smoking again you 're off the team . " The feeble primitive voice whined from the doorway . " I ai n't touched a weed since the beginning of season , Mr. Cald-well . " " Do n't lie to me , kid . Life 's too short to lie . About fiftysevenvarieties of people have squealed to me about yourp105smoking and if I 'm caught protecting you Zimmerman 'll have my neck . " " O. K. , Mr. Caldwell . I got you . " " I want the breast stroke and the two-twenty freestyle from you tonight . " " You 'll get ' cm , Mr. Caldwell . " I shut my eyes . It agonized me to hear my father talk like a coach ; it seemed so beneath us . This was unfair ; for was n't it after all what I wanted to hear from him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Perhaps it hurt me that Deifendorf had something concrete to give my father  --  the breast stroke and the two-twenty freestyle  --  while I had nothing . Unwilling to expose my skin , I had never learned to swim . The world of water was closed to me , so I had fallen in love with the air , which I was able to seize in great thrilling condensations within me that I labelled the Future : it was in this realm that I hoped to reward my father for his suffering . " Now . Judy , " he said . " I do n't understand what the quiz will be about . " " Chapters Eight , Nine , and Ten , as I said today in class . " " But that 's so much . " " Skim it , Judy . You 're no dope . You know how to study . " My father flipped open the book , the gray textbook with the microscope , the atom , and the dinosaur on the cover . " Look for italicized words , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Will that be one of the questions ? " " I ca n't tell you the questions , Judy . That would n't be fair to the others . But for your own information , what is magma ? " " Like comes from volcanoes ? " " I 'd accept that . Magma is igneous rock in its molten state . And here . Name the three types of rocks . "  | " ' Will you ask that ? " " I ca n't tell you , Judy . You understand that . But what are they ? " " Sentimentary . . . " " Igneous , sedimentary , and metamorphic . Give me an example of each . " " Granite , limestone , and marble , " I said . Judy looked over at me in fright . " Or basalt , shale , and slate , " my father said . The dull girl looked from me to him to me as if we had ganged up on her . For the moment , we had . There were happy moments when my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team . " You want to know something interesting , Judy ? " my father said . " The richest deposit of slate on the continent is right next door to us in Pennsylvania , in Lehigh and Northampton counties . " He tapped with his knuckles the blackboard behind him . " Every blackboard from coast to coast comes from around there , " he said . " We are n't expected to know that , are we ? " " It 's not in the book , no . But I thought you 'd be interested . Try to get interested . Forget your grades ; your father will survive . Do n't knock yourself out , Judy ; when I was your age , I did n't know what it was like to be young . And I 've never learned since . Now Judy . Listen to me . Some have it and some do n't . But everybody has something , even if it 's just being alive . The good Lord did n't put us here to worry about what we do n't have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man with five . Look at me and Peter . I have no talents , he has ten ; but I 'm not mad at him . I like him . He 's my son . " She opened her mouth and I expected her to ask " Will thatp107be on the quiz ? " but nothing came out . My father ruffled the book . " Name some erosional agents , " he said . She ventured , " Time ? " My father looked up and seemed to have taken a blow . His skin was underbelly-white beneath his eyes and an unnatural ruddy flush scored his cheeks in distinct parallels like the marks of angry fingers . " I 'd have to think about that , " he told her . " I was thinking of running water , glaciers , and wind . " She wrote these down on her tablet . " Diastrophism , " he said . " Isostasy . Explain them . Sketch a seismograph . What is a batholith ? " " You would n't ask all of those , would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of them , " he said . " Do n't think about the quiz . Think about the earth . Do n't you love her ? Do n't you want to know about her ? Isostasy is like a great fat woman adjusting her girdle . " Judy 's face lacked ease . Her cheeks were packed too tautly against her nose , making the lines there deep and sharp ; and there was a third vertical crease at the tip of her nose . Her mouth , too , had this look of too many folds , and when she spoke it worked tightly , up and down , like the mouth of a snapdragon . " Would you ask about the Protozone or whatever those things are ? " " Proterozoic Era . Yes , ma'am . A question might be , List the six geologic eras in order , with rough dates . When was the Cenozoic ? " " A billion years ago ? " " You live in it , girl . We all do . It began seventy million years ago . Or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ask that they be identified , with one point for the identification ,  |p108one  for the era , and one for the period . For instance , Brontops : mammal , Cenozoic , Tertiary . Eocene epoch , but I would n't expect you to know that . It may interest you for your own information that the brontops looked a lot like WilliamHoward Taft , who was President when I was your age . " I saw her write " No Epocks " on her tablet and draw a box around it . As my father talked on , she began to ornament the box with triangles . " Or Lepidodendron , " he said . " Giant fern , Paleozoic , Pennsylvanian . Or Eryops . What would that be , Peter ? " I really did n't know . " A reptile , " I guessed . " Mesozoic . " " An amphibian , " he said . " Earlier . Or Archaeopteryx , " he said , his voice quickening , sure we would know it . " What 's that , Judy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archaeopteryx . " He sighed . " The first bird . It was about the size of a crow . Its feathers evolved from scales . Study the chart on pages two-oh-three to two-oh-nine . Do n't tense up . Study the chart , and memorize what you 've written down , and you 'll do all right . " " I get so sort of sick and dizzy just trying to keep it straight , " she blurted , and it seemed she might cry . Her face was a folded bud , but already in her life it had begun to wilt . She was pale and this pallor for a moment swam around the room whose shades of varnish were like shades of honey gathered in a sweetly rotten forest . " We all do , " my father said , and things became firm again . " Knowledge is a sickening thing . Just do the best you can , Judy , and do n't lose any beauty sleep . Do n't get buffaloed . After Wednesday you can forget all about it and in no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it dawned on me , withp109some indignation , that my father out of pity had hinted away to her the entire quiz . When she left the room , he got up and closed the door and said to me , " That poor femme , her father 'll have an old maid on his hands . " We were alone together . I stopped leaning against the windowsill and said , " Maybe that 's what he wants . " I was very conscious of wearing a red shirt ; its flicker on the floor of my vision as I moved about the room seemed to instill my words with an enigmatic urbanity . " Do n't you believe it , " my father said . " The worst thing in the world is a bitter woman . That 's one thing about your mother , she 's never been bitter . You wo n't understand this , Peter , but your mother and I had a lot of fun together . " I doubted this , but the way he said it rendered me silent . One by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-bye to all the things he had known in this world . He took a sheet of blue paper from his desk and handed it to me . " Read it and weep , " he said . My first thought was that it was a fatal medical report . My stomach sank . I wondered , How could he have gotten it so soon ? But it was just one of Zimmerman 's monthly visitation reports . OLINGER PUBLIC SCHOOLS OFFICE OF THE SUPERVISING PRINCIPAL1/10/47TEACHER : G. W. CaldwellCLASS : loth grade Gen. Sci. , sec . CPERIOD OF VISITATION : I/8/47 II:O5 a.m . The teacher arrived in the classroom twelve minutes late . His surpriseat finding the supervising principal in charge was evident and was remarked upon by the class . Ignoring his students , the teacher attempted to engage the supervising principal in conversation andp110was refused . The students and the teacher then discussed the age of the universe , the size of the stars , the origins of the earth , and the outline of organic evolution . No attempt was discernible on the teacher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . The humanistic values implicit in the physical sciences were not elicited . The teacher at one point stopped himself from pronouncing the word " hell . " Disorder and noise were present from the beginning and rose in volume . The students did not seem well-prepared and the teacher consequently resorted to the lecture method . A minute before the final bell , he struck one boy on the back with a steel rod . Such physical procedure of course violates Pennsylvania state law and in the event of parental protest could result in dismissal . However , the teacher 's knowledge of his subject matter seemed good and some of his illustrations relating subject matter to his students ' everyday lives were effective . Signed , Louis M. Zimmerman . My father was pulling the windowshades and the room had been jerked into dusk as I read . " Well , " I said , " he thinks you 're effective . " " Is n't that the worst God-damn report was ever written ? He must have stayed up all night with that masterpiece . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , tenure or no tenure . " " Who was the kid you hit ? " I asked . " Deifendorf . That Davis bitch got the poor bastard all ex-cited . " " What 's poor about him ? He broke our Buick grille and now he 's going to get you fired . And two minutes ago he was in here and you were telling him the story of your life . " " He 's dumb , Peter . I feel sorry for him . It takes a rat to love a rat . " I swallowed a taste of envy and said , " Daddy , this is n't such a bad report . "  | " It could n't be worse , " he said , striding down the aisle with the windowpole . " It 's murder . And I deserve it . Fifteen years of teaching , and it 's all right there . Fifteen years of hell . " He took a rag from the book closet and went out the door . I read the report over again , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My father came back , having soaked the rag at the drinking fountain in the hall . With long rhythmic swipes shaped like sideways 8 's he washed the blackboard . His earnest swishing underlined the silence ; high on the wall the clock , controlled by the master clock in Zimmerman'soffice , clicked , jumping from 4:17 to 4 : 18 . " What does he mean , " I asked , " the humanistic values implicitin the physical sciences ? " " You ask him , " my father said . " Maybe he knows . Maybe down deep in the atom there 's a little man sitting in a rocking chair reading the evening paper . " " Do you really think the school board will see this ? " " Pray not , kid . It 's on file . I have three enemies on that board , one friend , and one I do n't know . Mrs. Herzog I do n't know if she 's heads or tails . They 'd love to get me out of there . Get rid of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 're all gon na need jobs . " He was grunting as he washed . " Maybe you should get out of teaching , " I said . My mother and I had often discussed this , but our discussions were cramped , for we kept bumping our heads against the fact that my father 's teaching was what sheltered us and let us live . " Too late , too late , " my father said . " Too late , too late . " He looked at the clock and said , " Jesus , I 'm not kidding  --  I 'm late . I told Doc Appleton I 'd be there at 4:30 . " My face baked with fear . My father never went to doctors.  |p112For  the first time , I had proof that his illness was not an illusion ; it was spreading outward into the world like a stain . " Really ? You 're really going ? " I was begging him to deny it . He knew my thoughts , and as we confronted each other through the vibrating shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the clock clicked . " I called him this noon , " my father said , as if he were confessing a sin to me . " I just want to go and hear him tell how smart he was at med school . " He hung the wet rag over the back of his chair to dry and went to the windowsill and untwisted the pencil sharpener case and poured a rosy stream of shavings into the wastebasket . The scent of cedar filled the room like the perfume of an offering . I asked , " Can I go with you ? " " Do n't do that , Peter . Go to the luncheonette and kill the time with your friends . I 'll pick you up in an hour and we 'll go into Alton . " " No , I 'll go with you . I do n't have any friends . " He took the sadly short coat from his closet . I followed him out . He closed the door of Room 204 behind us and we went down the stairs and through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This case depressed me ; I first saw it as a tiny child and still had a superstitious sense of each silver urn containing the ashes of a departed spirit . Heller , the head janitor , was sprinkling crumbs of red wax over the floor and sweeping them toward us with a broad broom . " Another day , another dollar , " my father called to him . " Ach , ja , " the janitor called back . " Too soon oldt and too late schmardt . " Heller was a short dark Dutchman with solidly black hair though he was sixty . He wore rimless glasses that made him look more scholarly than most of the teachersp113in the building . His voice echoed after my father 's down the hollow length of the hall , which looked wet where light from a doorway or window lay on it . I was reassured , believing that nothing as absolute and awesome as death could enter a world where grown men could exchange such banalities . While my father waited , I ran to my locker in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I thought , wrongly , there might be a space in the coming hours when I could do some homework . As I returned to them I heard my father apologizing to Heller for , apparently , a few marks he had made on the floor . " No , " he said , " I hate to make the wonderfulwork you do any harder for you than it is . Do n't think I do n't appreciate what a job it is to keep this stockyard clean . It 's the Augean stable every day of the week . " . " Ah well , " Heller said , and shrugged . AsI came closer , his black shape stooped , so the handle of the broom seemed to pierce it . He straightened and presented in the palm of his open hand , for my father 's and my inspection , a few dry oblongsbigger than ordinary dirt and not readily identifiable . " Seeds , " he said . " What kid would be carrying seeds ? " my father asked . " Maybe from an orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " my father said , and he seemed to shy , and we went out into the weather . The afternoon was clear and cold and the sun above the westward section of town made our shadows long before us . We seemed from our shadow to be a prancing one-headed creature with four legs . A trolley car went down the pike , its connective wheel sizzling and sparking on the wire , westward into Alton . This was our ultimate direction ; we were for the time being working against the tide . In striding silence , myp114steps three to his two , we passed the school 's side lawn . Some yards back from the pavement , there was a glass-fronted billboard . Miss Schrack 's senior art class made the posters for it ; the present one displayed a great B painted in the school 's colors , maroon and gold , and announced : ASKETBALLTUESDAY7 o'clockWe crossed the little irregular asphalt alley that separated the school property from Hummel 's Garage . Here the pavement was stained with little maps of dropped oil , islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pumps , and passed the neat white house beside whose little porch a trellis supported the crucified brown skeleton of a rose-vine ; in June this rose-vine bloomed and gave every boy who passed this way ambrosial thoughts of undressing Vera Hummel . Two doors fur'tflcr on was Minor 's Luncheonette . It shared a brick building with the Olinger Post Office . There were two plate-glass windows side by side : behind one of them fat Mrs. Passify , the post-mistress , surrounded by Wanted posters and lists of postal regulations , doled out stamps and money-orders ; behind the other , wreathed in adolescent smoke and laughter , Minor Kretz , also fat , scooped ice cream and concocted lemon Pepsis . The two establishments were symmetrically set up . Minor 's butterscotch-marble counter mirrored , through the dividing wall , Mrs. Passify 's barred windows and linoleum weighing-counter . As a child , I used to peek through the Local slot into the rear of the post office , seeing racks of sorted letters , stacked gray sacks , and one or two postmen in blue pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clatter . Likewise , to me as a child , the olderp115teen-agers in the luncheonette seemed to slump in the back booths behind a screen of smoke whose slots permitted glimpses of a mysterious privacy as utterly forbidden to me as if by federal law . The pinball machine and the cancellation machine were twins of noise ; where in the post office there was a small shelf bearing a dirty ruffle-edged blotter , a few splayed pens , and two dried bottles with gimcrack hinged mouths , in the luncheonette there was a small table offering for sale plastic cigarette cases , miniature gilt picture frames containing washed-out photographs of June Allyson and Yvonne de Carlo , playing cards with kittens and Scotties and cottages and lagoons on the back , and depraved 29 items like transparently loaded dice , celluloid pop eyes and buck teeth , dribble glasses , and painted plaster dog turds . Here you could buy , 2 for 5  --  , sepia postcards of the Olinger Town Hall , the business strip of the Alton Pike decked out with overhead lights and plywood candles for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-chlorinating plant way up above Cedar Top , and the town Honor Roll , looking as it did during the war  --  of wood and always being newly lettered  --  , before they put up the little stone one bearing only the names of those who had died . Here you could buy these cards , and next door , for a penny more , you could mail them ; the symmetry , carried right down to the worn spots of the two floors and the heating pipes running along the opposing walls , was so perfect that as a child I had imagined that Mrs. Passify and Minor Kretz were secretly married . At night , and on Sunday mornings , when their windows were dark , the mirroring membrane between them dissolved and , filling the unified brick shell with one fat shopworn sigh , they meshed . Here my father halted . In the brittle air his shoes scratchedp116on the cement and his mouth moved like a puppet's. " 0 . K. , Peter , " he said . " You go into Minor 's and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with me . " " What do you think he 'll tell you ? " I was tempted . Penny might be in the luncheonette . " He 'll tell me I 'm as healthy as a dumb old horse , " my father said , " and he 's as wise as a dirty old owl . " " You do n't want me to come with you ? " " What can you do , you poor kid ? Stay away and do n't depressyourself . Go see your friends , whoever the hell they think they arc . I never had any friends , so I ca n't imagine it . " My conscience and my father were rarely on opposite sides ; I compromised . " I 'll go in here , " I said . " For a minute , then I 'll catch up . " " Take your time , " he said , with a sudden sweeping motion of his hand , as if remembering that unseen audience before which he was an actor . " You got lots of time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill my hands are still bloody . " His talk was unreeling wider and wider ; I felt chilled . Walking off alone , he seemed lightened and looked thinner . Perhaps all men look thinner from the back . I wished that for my sake he would buy a respectable coat . As I watched , he took the knit cap out of his pocket and put it on his head ; pierced by embarrassment , I ran up the steps , bucked the door , and plunged into the luncheonette . It was a maze , Minor 's place . So many bodies : yet only a tiny section of the school ever came here . Others had other places ; the set at Minor 's was the most criminal and it thrilled me to be , however marginally , a part of it . I felt in this clouded interior a powerful secret lurking , whose nostrils exhaled the smoke and whose hide exuded the warmth . The voices jos/Cling in the stable-warmth all seemed to be gossiping about the same thing , some event that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunted at that age by the suspicion that a wholly different world , gaudy and momentous , was enacting its myths just around the corners of my eyes . I pushed my way through the bodies as if through the leaves of a close-set series of gates . I picked my way past one , two , three booths and there , yes , there , she was . She . Why is it , love , that faces we love look upon each remeeting so fresh , as if our hearts have in this instant again minted them ? How can I describe her to you justly ? She was small and not unusual . Her lips were too plump and irksomely selfsatisfied ; her nose rather cursory and nervous . Her eyelids were vaguely Negroid , heavy , puffy , bluish , and incongruously worldly-wise when taken with the startled grassy innocence of her eyes . I believe it was these incongruities  --  between lips and nose , eyes and lids  --  these soft and silent clashes like the reticulating ripples hinting in the flow of a stream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this delicate irresolution of feature held out the possibility of her being worthy of me . And made her seem always a bit unexpected . She was occupying one side of a booth and there was space beside her . Across the table , two ninth-graders she dimly knew , a girl and a boy , were tugging at each other 's buttons , blind to everything . She was gazing at them and did not see me until my body , easing in , pushed hers . " Peter ! " I unbuttoned my pea jacket so the devil-may-care flame of my shirt showed . " Give me a cigarette . " " Where have you been all day ? " " Here and there . I 've seen you . " Nicely she tapped one of her Luckies from her purple and  |p118yellow  plastic case , which had a little sliding door that opened and shut . She looked at me with flecked green irises whose perfect circles of black seemed dilated . I did not understand my ability to dissolve her composure and in my heart honestly took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ; it couched a kind of repose I had never known before . As a baby wishes to be put to bed , my hand wished to be between her thighs . I dragged and inhaled . " I had a dream about you last night . " She looked away , as if to give herself space in which to blush , " What did you dream ? " " Not quite what you think , " I said . " I dreamed you turned into a tree , and I called Penny , Penny , come back ! ' , but you did n't , and I was leaning my face against the bark of a tree . " She took it a bit dryly , saying , " Why how sad . " " It was sad . Everything around me is sad these days . " " What else is sad ? " " My father thinks he 's sick . " " What does he think he has ? " " I do n't know . Cancer ? " " Really ? " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giddiness ; I wanted to put it out but instead , for her sake , inhaled . The booth partition across from us leaped a foot closer and the girl and the boy had fallen to bumping heads , like a pair of doped rams . " Sweetie , " Penny said to me . " Your father 's probably all right . He 's not very old . " " He 's fifty , " I said . " He just turned fifty last month . He always said he 'd never live to be fifty . " She frowned in thought , my poor dumb little girl , and triedp119to find some words to comfort me , who was so infinitely ingeniousat evading comfort . At last she told me , " Your father'stoo funny to die . " A ninth-grader , she only had him as a teacher in study-hall ; but the whole school of course knew my father . " Everybody dies , " I told her . " Yes , but not for a long time . " " Yes , but at some point that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we carried the mystery to the far rim , and could only return . " Has he seen a doctor ? " she asked , and , as impersonally as an act of weather , her thigh under the table had become tangentto mine . " That 's where he is now . " I shifted my cigarette to my right hand and casually dropped , as if to scratch an itch , my freed left hand onto my thigh . " I should be with him , " I told Penny , wondering if my profile looked as elegant as it felt , jut-lipped under a plume of smoke . " Why ? What could you do ? " " I do n't know . Be of some comfort . Just be there . " As naturallyas water slips from higher to lower my fingers moved to her thigh from my own . Her skirt had a faunish weave . This touch , though she did not acknowledge it , interrupted the flow of her thought . She brought out jaggedly , " How can you ? You 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , speaking quickly lest she think my touch was more than an accident , an incident of innocent elements . Having gained my place , I expanded it , fanning my fingers , flattening my palm against the yielding solid . " But I 'm the only kid he has . " My using my father 's word " kid " brought him too close ; his wrinkling squint , his forward-leaning anxietyp120seemed to loom in the unquiet air . " I 'm the only person in the world he can talk to . " " That ca n't be , " she said very softly , in a voice more intimate than the words . " Your father has hundreds of friends . " " No , " I said , " he has no friends ; they do n't help him . He just told me . " And with something like the questing fear that made my father , in conversations with strangers , gouge deeper . than courtesy found common , my hand , grown enormous , seized the snug wealth of her flesh so completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little finger , perhaps , touched through the muffle of faun-feeling cloth the apex where they joined , the silken crotch , sacred . " Peter , no , " she said , still softly , and her cool fingertips took my wrist and replaced my hand on my own leg . I slapped my thigh and sighed , well-satisfied . I had dared more than I had dreamed . So it surprised me as needless and in a shy way whorish when she added in a murmur , " All these people . " As if chastity needed an outer explanation ; as if , if we were alone , the earth would sweep up and imprison my forearms . I stubbed out my cigarette and pleaded , " I must go after him . " I asked her , " Do you pray ? " " Pray ? " " Yes . " " Yes . " " Will you pray for him ? My father . " " All right . " " Thank you . You 're good . " We both looked back amazed at what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty of blasphemy , using God as a tool with which to score myself the deeper on this girl 's heart . But no , I decided , her promise top121pray did genuinely lighten my burden . Rising , I asked her , " Are you coming to the basketball game tomorrow night ? " " I could . " " Shall I save you a seat ? " " If you like . " " Or you save me one . " " All right . Peter . " " Huh ? " " Do n't worry so much . Not everything is your fault . " Now the couple opposite us , classmates of Penny 's , whose names were Bonnie Leonard and Richie Lorah , came out of their nudging trance . In a burst of derisive triumph Richie yelled at me , " The Pumpkin Eater ! " Bonnie feeble-mindedly laughed , and the air of the place , where I had felt so secure , became dangerous with words aimed at my face . Senior boys sporting adult pockets of shadow under their eyes called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man ? How 's Georgie Porgie puddin' ' ' n ' pie ? " Once a student had had my father , he did not forget it , and the memory seemed to seek shape in mockery . An emotion of fermented guilt and fondnesswould seek to purge itself upon me , the petty receptacle of a myth . I hated it and yet it did give me importance ; being Caldwell 's son lifted me from the faceless mass of younger children and made me , on my father 's strength alone , exist in the eyes of these Titans . I had only to listen and seem to smile as sweetly cruel memories tumbled from them : " He used to lie down in the aisle and holler , Come on , walk all over me , you will anyway ' ... " ... about six of us filled our pockets up with horsechestnuts. . . "  | " ... seven minutes to the hour everybody stood up and stared as if his fly was open . . . " " Christ , I 'll never forget . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the class said she could n't see the decimal point . . . he went to the window and scooped some snow off the sill and made a ball . . . hard as hell at the fucking blackboard . . . " " Now can you see it ? ' he said . " " Christ , what a character . " " You got a great father there , Peter . " These ordeals usually ended with some such unctuous benediction . It thrilled me , coming from these tall criminals , who smoked in the lavatories , drank hooch in Alton , and visited Philadelphia whorehouses staffed by Negro women . My obliginglaugh stiffly dried on my face and , suddenly contemptuous , they turned their backs . I rethreaded my way to the front of the luncheonette . Someone in the booths was imitatinga rooster . In the jukebox Doris Day was singing " SentimentalJourney . " From the rear a chorus of cheers rhythmicallyrose as the pinball machine , gonging in protest , gave up one free game after another . I looked back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the playing ; there was no mistaking those broad , faintly fat shoulders , the turned-up collar of the canary-yellow corduroy shirt , the baroque head of wavy hair crying for a haircut and scooped behind into a wet ducktail . Johnny Dedman was one of my idols . A senior flunked back into a junior , he performed exquisitelyall the meaningless deeds of coordination , jitterbuggingand playing pinball and tossing salted nuts into his mouth . By an accident of alphabetization he sat next to me in one study hall and taught me a few tricks , how to make ap123wooden popping noise by pulling my finger from my mouth , for instance  --  though I could never do it as loudly as he . He was inimitable and no doubt it was foolish to try . He had a rosy babyish face and a feathery mustache of pale unshaven hair and an absolute purity of ambitionlessness : even his misbehaviorwas carried forward without any urgency or stridence . He did have a criminal record : once in Alton , wild on beer at the age of sixteen , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sought this out but rather fell into it coolly , as he seemed on the dance floor to fall into the steps that answered his partner and made her , hair flying , cheeks glowing , ass switching , swing . The pinball machine never tilted on him ; he claimed he could feel the mercury swaying in the Tilt trigger . He played the machines as if he had invented them . Indeed , his one known connection with the world of hard facts was an acknowledged mechanical ability . Outside of Industrial Arts , he consistently got E 's . There was something sublime in the letter that took my breath away . In that year , the year I was fifteen , if I had not wanted so badly to be Vermeer , I would have tried to be Johnny Dedman . But of course I had the timid sense to see that you do not will to be Johnny Dedman ; you fall into it at birth , ripe from the beginning . Outdoors I turned the points of my wide jacket collar against my throat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office . The trolley car released from waitingat the turnout by the trolley that was going westward into Alton as my father and I left the school swayed up the pike , full of gray workers and standing shoppers coming home , goingeastward toward Ely , the tiny town at the end of the line . I had lost perhaps ten minutes . I hurried and , having told Penny to pray , prayed Let him live , let him live , do not letp124my father be sick . The prayer was addressed to all who would listen ; in concentric circles it widened , first , into the town , and , beyond , into the hemisphere of sky , and , beyond that , into what was beyond . The sky behind the eastward houses already was purple ; above , it was still deep daylight blue ; and behind me the sky beyond the houses was aflame . The sky 's blue was an optical illusion that , though described to me in General Science class by my father himself , my mind could only picture as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost invisibly pink pieces of cellophane will together make rose ; add a third , you have red ; a fourth , crinkling crimson ; and a fifth , such a scarlet as must blaze in the heart of the most ardent furnace . If the blue dome beyond the town was an illusion , how much more , then , of an illusion might be what is beyond that . Please , I added to my prayer , like a reminded child . Doc Appleton 's house , which had his office and waitingroomin the front part , was a custard-colored stucco set deep on a raised lawn sustained by a sandstone wall a little less than my height . On either side of the steps up to the lawn there were two stone posts topped by large concrete balls , a device of exterior decoration common in Olinger but rare , I have since discovered , elsewhere . Abruptly , as I raced up the sloping walk toward the doctor 's door , all the lamps in the homes of the town began to burn  --  as in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjacent color glow . The broad line between day and night in this instant had been crossed . PLEASE RING AND WALK IN . Since I was not myself a patient , I did not ring . I imagined that somehow if I did , Doc Appleton'saccounts would be thrown off , like a checkbook with anp125uncashed check from it . In the vestibule of his house there was a cocoa mat and an immense stucco umbrella stand ornamented , higgledypiggledy , with chips of colored glass . Above the umbrella stand hung a small dark print , frightful to look at , of some classical scene of violence . The horror of the spectators was so conscientiously dramatized , the jumble of their flung arms and gaping mouths rendered with such an intensity of scratching , the effect of the whole so depressing and dead , that I could never bring myself to focus on what the central event was  --  my impression was vaguely of a flogging . In the corner of the print , before I snapped my head away as if from the initial impact of pornography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  snaking about a tiny temple etched with spidery delicacy to indicate distance . That some forgottenartist in an irrevocable sequence of hours had labored , doubtless with authentic craft and love , to produce this ugly , dusty , browned , and totally ignored representation seemed to contain a message for me which I did not wish to read . I went into Doc Appleton 's waiting-room on my right . Here old oak furniture padded in cracked black leather lined the walls and encircled a central table laden with battered copies of Liberty and The Saturday Evening Post . A three-legged coat rack like a gaunt witch glowered in one corner and the shelf above its shoulder supported a stuffed crow gone gray with dust . The waiting-room was empty ; the door of the consulting-roomwas ajar and I heard my father 's voice asking , " Could it be hydra venom ? " " Just a minute , George . Who came in ? " With the broad bald face of a yellowish owl Doc Appleton peered out of his office . " Peter , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindness and competence pierced the mor/bid atmosphere of his house . Though Doc Appleton delivered me , I first remembered him from a time when I was in the third grade and , worried about my parents ' fights , bullied by older boys coming back from school , ridiculed at recess for my skin whose spots under the stress had spread to my face , I came down with a cold that did not go away . We were poor and therefore slow to call a doctor . On the third day of my fever they called him . I remember I was propped up on two pillows in my parents ' great double bed . The wallpaper and bedposts and picture books on my covers beside me all wore that benevolent passive flatness that comes with enough fever ; no matter how I wiped and swallowed , my mouth stayed dry and my eyes stayed moist . Sharp footsteps disciplined the stairs and a fat man wearing a brown vest and carrying a fat brown bag entered with my mother . He glanced at me and turned to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What have you been doing to this child ? " There were two strange facts about Doc Appleton : he was a twin , and like me he had psoriasis . His twin was Hester Appleton , who taught Latin and French at the high school . She was a shy thick-waisted spinster , smaller than her brother and gray-haired whereas he was bald . But their brief hook noses were identical and the resemblance was plain . The idea , when I was a child , of these two stately elderly people having popped together from the same mother had an inexhaustible improbability that made them both seem still , in part , infants . Hester lived with the doctor in this house . He had married but his wife had died or disappeared years ago under dark circumstances . He had had a son , Skippy , years older than I but like me an only child ; my father had had him in school and the boy had gone on to become a surgeon somewhere in the Mid/west , in Chicago , St. Louis , or Omaha . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this further shadow : Doc Appleton belonged to no church , neither Reformed nor Lutheran , and believed , they said , in nothing . This third strange fact I had picked out of the air . The second , his psoriasis , my mother had revealed to me ; until I was born only he and she in the town had been blighted by it . It had kept him , my mother said , from becoming a surgeon , for when the time came for him to roll up his sleeves , the pink scabs would be revealed and the patient on the table in fright might cry , " Physician , heal thyself ! " It was a pity , my mother thought , for in her opinion Doc Appleton 's great talent lay in his hands , was manipulative rather than diagnostic . She often described how he had painted and cured a chronic sore throat of hers with one fierce expert swab of a long cotton-tipped stick . She seemed to have thought , at one time in her life , a lot about Doc Appleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his waitingroom , his pale round face straining to focus on my brow . He said , " Your skin looks fair . " " It 's not too bad yet , " I said . " It 's worst in March and April . " " Very little on your face , " he said . I had thought there was none . He seized my hands  --  I felt that fierce sureness of touch my mother had felt  --  and studied my fingernails in the light filtering from the brighter room . " Yes , " he said . " Stippled . Your chest ? " " Pretty bad , " I said , frightened I would have to show him . He blinked massively and dropped my hands . He was wearing a vest but not a coat and his shirtsleeves above the elbow were clipped by black elastics like narrow bands of mourning . A gold watch-chain formed a shifting pendulous arc across thep128brown vest of his belly . He wore a stethoscope around his neck . He switched on a light , and an overhead chandelier of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pools of shine onto the wash of magazines on the central table . " You read , Peter , while I finish with your Dad . " From the consulting-room my father 's voice earnestly called , " Let the kid come in , Doc . I want him to hear what you have to tell me . Whatever happens to me , happens to him . " I was shy of entering , for fear of finding my father undressed . But he was fully clothed and sitting on the edge of a small hard chair with stencilled Dutch designs . In this bright room his face looked blanched by shock . His skin looked loose ; his little smile had spittle in the corners . " No matter what happens to you in life , kid , " he said to me , " I hope you never come up against the sigmoidoscope . Brrough ! " " Tcha , " Doc Appleton grunted , and lowered his weight into his desk chair , a revolving and pivoting one that seemed to have been contoured for him . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the accustomedcurve of the carved wooden arms , which culminated in an inner scroll . " Your trouble , George , " he said , " is you have never come to terms with your own body . " To be out of their way , I sat on a high white metal stool beside a table of surgicaltools . " You 're right , " my father said . " I hate the damn ugly thing . I do n't know how the hell it got me through fifty years . " Doc Appleton removed the stethoscope from around his neck and laid it on his desk , where it writhed and then subsidedlike a slain rubber serpent . His desk was a wide old rolltopfull of bills , pill envelopes , prescription pads , cartoons clipped from magazines , empty phials , a brass letter opener , ap129blue box of loose cotton , and an omega-shaped silver clamp . His sanctum had two parts : this , the one where his desk , his chairs , his table of surgical tools , his scales , his eye-chart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk and a partitionof frosted glass , the other , the innermost sanctum , where his medicines were stored on shelves like bottles of wine and jugs of jewels . To here he would retire at the end of a consultation , emerging in time with a little labelled bottle or two , and from here at all times issued a complex medicinal fragrancecompounded of candy , menthol , ammonia , and dried herbs . This cloud of healing odor could be sniffed even in the vestibule that contained the mat , the print , and the stucco umbrellastand . The doctor pivoted in his swivel chair and faced us ; his bald head was not like Minor Kretz 's , which declared in its glittering knobs the plates and furrows of his skull . Doc Appleton 's was a smooth luminous rise of skin lightly flecked with a few pinker spots that only I , probably , would have noticed and recognized as psoriasis . He pointed his thumb at my father . " You see , George , " he said , " you believe in the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up on and ride for a while and then get off . You ride your body too hard . You show it no love . This is not natural . This builds up nervous tension . " My stool was uncomfortable and Doc Appleton 's philosophizingalways afflicted me with embarrassment . I deduced that the verdict had already been handed down and from the fact that the doctor felt leisure to be boring I deduced that the verdict had been favorable . Still I remained in some suspenseand studied the table of wiggly probes and angled scissorsas if they were an alphabet in which I could read the word . AI Al , they said . Among these silver exclamationsp130needles and arrows and polished clamps  --  there was that strange hammer for tapping your knee to make your leg jerk . It was a heavy triangle of red rubber fixed in a silver handle made concave to improve the doctor 's grip . My very first trips to this office that I could remember centered about that hammer , and the table of instruments took its center from this arrowhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the shape of an arrowhead but also of a fulcrum and as I watched it it seemed to sink , sink with its infinitesimal cracks and roundnesses of use and age , sink down through time and to be at the bottom sufficiently simple and ponderous to make there a pivot for everything. " .. . know thyself , George , " Doc Appleton was saying . His pink firm palm , round as a child 's , lifted in admonition . " Now how long have you been teaching ? " " Fourteen years , " my father said . " I was laid off late in ' 31 and was out of work the whole year the kid was born . In the summer of ' 33 , Al Hummel , who as you know is Pop Kramer 's nephew , came up to the house and suggested  --  " " Does your father enjoy teaching ? Peter . " It took me a second to realize I had been addressed . " I do n't know , " I said , " at times 1 suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess he does n't . " " It 'd be O. K. , " my father said , " if I thought I was any good at it . But I do n't have the gift of discipline . My father , the poor devil , did n't have it either . " " You 're not a teacher , " Doc Appleton told him . " You 're a learner . This creates tension . Tension creates excess gastric juice . Now George , the symptoms you describe might be merely mucinous colitis . Constant irritation of the digestive track can produce pain and the sensation of anal fullness you describe . Until the X-ray , we 'll assume that 's what it is. "  | " I would n't mind plugging ahead at something I was n't any good at , " my father said , " if I knew what the hell the point of it all was . I ask , and nobody 'll tell me . " " What does Zimmerman say ? " " He does n't say a thing . He thrives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor devils under him who do n't have it , he just laughs at us . I can hear him laughingevery time the clock ticks . " " Zimmerman and myself , " Doc Appleton said , and sighed , " have never seen eye to eye . I went to school with him , you know . " " I did n't know that . " My father was lying . Even I had known that , Doc Appletonsaid it so often . Zimmerman was a chafe to him , a lifelong sore point . I was furious with my father for being so obsequious , for laying us both open this way to a long and oftenchewedstory . " Why , yes , " Doc Appleton said , blinking in surprise that my father should be ignorant of such a famous fact . " We went all through the Olinger schools together . " He leaned back in the chair that fitted him so exquisitely . " Now when we were born here it was n't called Olinger , it was called Tilden , in honor of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olinger was still farming all that land to the north of the pike and east of where the cardboard box factory is now . I remember seeing him take his team into Alton , a little old fella not five feet tall with a black hat and a mustache you could have wiped your table silver on . He had three sons : Cot ; who went crazy one night and killed two steer with a hand hoe , Brian , who had a child by the Negro woman they had to work in the kitchen , and Guy , the youngest , who sold the land to the real estate developers and died of trying to eatp132the money up . Cot , Brian , and Guy : they 're all beneath the ground now . Now what did I start to say ? " " About you and Mr. Zimmerman , " I said . My impudent impatience was not lost on him ; he looked over my father 's shoulder at me and his lower lip slid thoughtfullyto one side and then to the other . " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . " Well , Louis and I went through the grades together when they were scattered all over the borough . First and second grade was over by Pebble Creek where they put the parking lot for the new diner ; third and fourth grades were in Mrs. Eberhardt 's barn that she rented the town for a dollar a year ; fifth and sixth were in a stone building on what they used to call the Black Acres , because the loam was so deep , over beyond where the race track used to be . Whenever they 'd hold a weekday race , on Tuesdays usually , they used to let us out of class because they needed boys to hold and comb the horses . Then for those that kept on past sixth grade , by the time I was the age they had built the high school at the Elm Street corner . Now did n't that look grand to us then ! That 's the building , Peter , where you went to elementary school . " " I did n't know that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doc Appleton seemed pleased . He relaxed into his creaking chair so deeply his creased high-top shoes dangled , just touchingtheir toes to the threadbare carpet . " Now Louis M. Zimmerman , " he went on , " was a month older than myself , and a great hand with the girls and the old women . Mrs. Mettzler , that was our teacher in the first and second grade , a woman not an inch under six feet tall and with legs like the siding slats of a tobacco shed , took a shine to Louis , and for thatp133matter so did Miss Leet and Mrs. Mabry that followed her ; all his way through school Louis had the best of attention , while of course nobody thought a second thought about an ugly duckling like Harry Appleton . Louis always had that edge . You see : he was quick . " " You said a mouthful , " my father said . " He 's always a jump ahead of me , I 'll tell you that . " " He never had , you sec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his plump scrubbed hands , pressing the palms together , lightly chopping the knuckles of one hand with the edge of the other , " the adversity . He alwaysknew success and never developed the character . So he spreads , you see , " and his white fingers crabbed through the air , " like a cancer . He 's not a man to trust , though he gives the Bible lesson every Sunday up at the Reformed . Tcha . If he was a tumor , George , I 'd take a knife "  --  he shifted his hand and held up his thumb and it did seem very stiff and sharp  --  " and cut him out . " And his thumb , sickle-shaped backwards with pressure , scooped a curt divot out of the air . " I appreciate your being frank with me , Doc , " my father said , " but me and those other poor devils up at the high school are stuck with him forever as far as I can see . Three out of four people in this town swear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People are foolish , " Doc Appleton said , and lurched forward in his chair so that his feet softly plopped on the carpet . " That 's one thing you learn in the practice of medicine . People are by and large very foolish . " He tapped my father 's knee once , twice , three times before continuing . His voice assumed a confidential wheeze . " Now when I went to medical school down at Penn , " he said , " they thought , you know , ap134country boy , dumb . After that first year they were n't saying so dumb any more . It might be I was a little slower than some but I had the character . I took my time and learned the books . When the class graduated , who do you think was at the head ? Heh , Peter  --  you 're a bright boy . Who do you think ? " " You , " I said . I did n't want to say it but the word was forced from me . That 's how those Olinger bigwigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling or in any way showing that he had heard . Then he looked into my father 's face , nodded , and said , " I was n't at the head , but I was up there pretty well . I did all right for a country boy supposed to be dumb . George , have you been listening to what I 've been saying ? " And without warning , in that strange way monologuists have of ending a conversation as if their time has been wasted , he got up and went into his inner sanctum and made tinkling noises out of sight . He returned with a small bottle of cherry-colored fluid that from the way it danced and gleamed seemed more mercurial than liquid . He pressed the bottle into my father 's wart-freckled hand and said , " A tablespoon every three hours . Until we have the X-rays we wo n't know any more than we know now . Get rest and do n't think . Without death , now , there could n't be life . Health , " he said with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an animal condition . Now most of our ill-health comes from two places  --  the brain and the back . We made two mistakes ; one was to stand up and the other was to start thinking . It strains the spine and the nerves . It makes tension and the brain makes the body . " He angrily strode toward me and roughly pressed my hair back from my forehead and stared intensely at my brow . " You 're not as bad on your scalp as your mother , " he said ,  |p135and  released me . I flattened my hair forward again , humiliated and dazed . " Do you hear from Skippy ? " my father asked . All fierceness and shimmer left the doctor ; he became a heavy old man in a vest and fastened shirtsleeves . " He 's on a staff in St. Louis , " he said . " You 're too modest to say it , " my father told him , " but I bet you 're prouder than hell of him . I know I am ; next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had and not too much of my thickheadedness seemed to rub off on him , thank God . " " He has his mother 's graces , " Doc Appleton said after a pause , and a pall had fallen . The waiting-room seemed long deserted and the black leather furniture depressed and dented by the shadows of mourners . Our voices and footsteps felt lost in dust and I felt viewed from thousands of years in the future . My father offered to pay . The doctor waved his dollars aside , saying , " We 'll wait till the end of the story . " " You 're a straight-shooter and I 'm grateful , " my father said . Outside , in the gnashing , black , brilliantly alive cold , my fathersaid to me , " See , Peter ? He did n't tell me what I want to know . They never do . " " What happened before I came ? " " He put me through the mill and made an X-ray appointmentat Homeopathic in Alton for six o'clock tonight . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doc Appleton what he means . That 's how he keeps his reputation . " " He does n't seem to like Zimmerman but I could n't make out exactly why . "  | " The story there , Peter , is that Zimmerman  --  I guess you 're old enough to say this to  --  Zimmerman 's supposed to have made love to Doc Appleton 's wife . It happened if it happened at all before you were born . There was even supposed to be some doubt as to who Skippy 's father was . " " But where 's Mrs. Appleton now ? " " Nobody knows where she went . She 's either alive or dead . " ' " What was her name ? " " Corinna . " Alive or dead , made love , before you were born  --  these . phrases , each rich with mystery , rendered the night brimmingaround us terribly deep , and from beyond the far rim like an encircling serpent my father 's death seemed to tighten its coil . The darkness that above the heads of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mica in an ocean seemed great enough to contain even this most mighty of impossible events . I chased him , his profile pale and grim in streetlight , and like a ghost he kept always a step ahead of me . He put on his cap and my head was cold . " What are we going to do ? " I called after him . " We 'll drive into Alton , " he said . " I 'll get my X-ray at the Homeopathic and then 1 ' 11 go across the street to the Y. M. C. A. I want you to go to the movies . Get in where it 's warm and come up to the Y afterwards . That should be about seven-thirty or quarter to eight . The meet should be over by eight . It 's about quarter after five now . Do you have enough money for a hamburg ? " " Sure , I guess . Hey . Daddy . How are your aches and pains ? " " Better , Peter . Do n't worry about me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only think about one pain at a time . " " There ought to be some way , " I said , " to make you healthy . " " Kill me , " my father said . The sentence sounded strange , outdoors , in the dark and cold , coming from above , as his face and body hurried forward . " That 's the cure-all , " he said . " Kill me . " We walked west to where the car had been left on the school parking lot and got into it and drove into Alton . Lights , there were lights on both sides solidly supporting us for the full three miles , except for the void on the right that was the poorhouse corn fields and for the interval in which we crossed the Running Horse River over the bridge where the hitchhikerhad seemed to lift into the air on his long-heeled shoes . We cut through the gaudy heart of the city , across Riverside Drive , up Pechawnee Avenue , into Weiser Street and Conrad Weiser Square , up Sixth , across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only my father seemed to know about . The alley led us to where the railroad embankment widened into a black shoulder sparkling with cinders , near the Essick 's coughdrop plant , which flooded the whole sinister area with its sickly-sweet fumes . The Essick 's employees used this leftoversloping bit of railroad property as a parking lot , and so my father used it now . We got out . The slams of our doors echoed . The shape of our car sat on its shadow like a frog looking into a mirror . It was alone on the lot . A blue light overhead kept watch like a cold angel . My father and I parted by the railroad station . He walked left , toward the hospital . I walked on , to Weiser Street ,  |p138where  five movie theatres advertised their shows . The downtowncrowds were streaming home . The matinees were dismissed ; the stores , their windows proclaiming January White Sales and drifted deep with cotton sheets , were stringing padlockedchains across their doors ; the restaurants were in the lull of setting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft-pretzel carts draped them with tarpaulins and pushed them away . The city excited me most at this hour , when my father abandoned me and I , a single cross-current in the tidal exodus , strolled homeless , free to gaze into jewellers ' windows , to eavesdrop at the mouths of cigar stores , to inhale the breath of pastry shops where fat ladies in rimless spectacles and white smocks sighed behind bright trays of bear-claws , sticky buns , glazed doughnuts , pecan rolls , and shoo-fly pies . At this hour when the workers and shoppers of the city were hurrying by foot , bus , car , and trolley home to their duties , I was for a time released from mine , not merely permitted but positively instructed by my father to go to a movie and spend two hours out of this world . The world , my world with all its oppressive detail of pain and inconsequence was behind me ; I wandered among caskets of jewels which would someday be mine . Frequently at this moment , my luxurious space of freedomall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpless at her distance to control me or protect me , my mother with her farm , her father , her dissatisfaction , her exhausting alternationsof recklessness and prudence , wit and obtuseness , transparence and opacity , my mother with her wide tense face and strange innocent scent of earth and cereal , my mother whose blood I was polluting in the gritty inebriation of Al ton 's downtown . Then I would seem smothered in a rotten brilliance and become very frightened . But my guilt could notp139be eased , I could not go to her , for of her own will she had placed ten miles between us ; and this rejection on her part made me vengeful , proud , and indifferent : an inner Arab . The five movie palaces of Weiser Street in Alton were Loew 's , the Embassy , the Warner , the Astor , and the Ritz . I went to the Warner and saw " Young Man with a Horn , " starring Kirk Douglas , Doris Day , and Patricia Neal . As my father had promised , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , I came in on the cartoon . The day was the thirteenth of the month so I did not expect it to be lucky . The cartoon was , of course , a Bugs Bunny . Loew 's had Tom and Jerry , the Embassy Popcye , the Astor either Disney , the , best , or Paul Terry , the worst . I bought a box of popcorn and a box of Jordan Almonds , though both were bad for my skin . The sidelights were soft yellow and time melted . At the end , when the hero , the trumpeter who was based upon Bix Beiderbecke , had finally fought free of the rich woman who with her insinuating crooked smile ( Patricia Neal ) had been corrupting his art , and the good artistic woman ( Doris Day ) , her lover restored to her , sang , and behind her own transparent voice Harry James 's trumpet pretending to be Kirk Douglas 's lifted like a silver fountain higher and higher into " With a Song in My Heart "  --  only here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did I remember my father . An urgent sense of being late caught me up . The sidelights turned bright . I fled from my seat . In the floor-to-ceiling mirrors that lined the sloping glaring lobby I saw myself full-length , flushed , pink-eyed , the shoulders of my flaming shirt drenched with the white flakes I had scratched from my scalp in the dark . It was a habit of mine to scratch when unseen . I brushed my shoulders wildly andp140on the cold street was startled by the real faces , which seemed meagre and phantasmal after the great glowing planetary visions I had been watching slowly collide , merge , part , and recombine . I ran toward the Y. M. C. A. It was two blocks up from Weiser Street , at Perkiomen and Beech . I ran along the railroad tracks . The narrow pavement was lined with small bars and shut barber parlors . The sky was an unsteady yellowabove the tenements and even at the zenith paleness drained stars from the night . The smell of coughdrops coming from a distance mocked my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , seemed remote and irrelevant and conceived in cruelty . The Y. M. C. A. smelled of sneakers and the floor was scuffed gray . At the center desk a Negro boy sat reading a comic book underneath a bulletin board shingled with obsoleteposters and bygone tournament results . Far away down a strangely green hall , green as if lit by bulbs shining through grape arbor leaves , a game of billiards studiously muttered . From the other direction drifted the patient ga-glokka , gaglokkaof a ping-gong game . The boy behind the desk looked up from his comic book and frightened me ; there were no Negroesin Olinger and I was superstitiously timid of them . They seemed to me wizards , possessing the black secrets of love and song . But his face was all innocence , all innocence and the shade of malted milk . " Hi , " I said and , holding my breath , swiftly walked to the passageway that led to the downward flight of concrete that in turn led , through the locker room , to the pool . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third , as of skin , grew upon me . In the great tiled chamber where the pool lived , a barking resonance broke everything into fragments . On the littlep141wooden bleachers at the poolside my father sat with a wet and naked boy , Deifendorf . Deifendorf wore only the skimpy black official trunks ; the droop of his genitals was limply definedbetween his spread thighs . Hair flowed down his chest and forearms and legs and a stream of water was running across the wood where his bare feet rested . The curves and flats of his hunched white body were harmonious but for his horny red hands . He and my father greeted me with grins that looked much the same : snaggled , ignorant , conspiratorial . To annoy Deifendorf I asked him , " Ja win the breast stroke and the two-twenty ? " " I won more than you did , " he answered . " He won the breast stroke , " my father said . " I 'm proud of you , Deify . You kept your promise to the best of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shit if I 'd seen that guy in the far lane I 'd 've taken the two-twenty too . Bastard he sneaked in on me , I thought I 'd won it , I was just gliding in . " " That kid swam a good race , " my father said . " He won it honestly . He paced himself . Foley 's a good coach . If I was any kind of a coach , Deify , you 'd be king of the county ; you 're a natural . If I was any kind of a coach and you 'd give up ciga-rettes . " " Fuck I can hold my breath eighty seconds as it is , " Deifendorfsaid . There was in their talk a mutual flattery that annoyed me . I sat on the other side of my father and concentrated on the pool : it was the hero here . It filled its great underground cage with staccato glitter and the eye-flagellating stink of chlorine . The reflection of the bleachers across the pool , where the opposing team and the judges sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds seemed a bearded face . Shattered again and again , the water yet sought with the quickness of crystalline reaction to recompose itself . Shouts and splashes broken by echoes and countersplashes made in collision new words , words of no language I knew , garbled barks that seemed to be answers to a question I had unknowingly asked . CECROPS ! INACHUS ! DA ! No , it was not me who had asked the question , but my father beside me . " What does it feel like to win ? " he had asked aloud , speakingstraight ahead and thus equally to Deifendorf and me . " Jesus , I 'll never know . " Flecks and blobs skidded back and forth across the volatile aqua skin . The lines of lane demarcation on the pool bottom looped and wavered , refracted , toward the surface ; the bearded face seemed about to constitute itself when , each time , another boy dived . Everything was over but the diving . One of our divers , Danny Horst , a runty senior with a huge mane of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairband like a Greek girl , came forward on the board , muscles swirling , and executeda running forward somersault , knees tucked , toes taut , so perfectly , uncoiling into the water through a soft splash as symmetrical as the handles of a vase , that one of the judges flashed the i o card . " In fifteen years , " my father said , " I 've never seen the ten used before . It 's like saying God has come down to earth . There is no such thing as perfection . " " Thatta baby Danny boy , " Deifendorf yelled , and a patter of applause from both teams greeted the diver as he surfaced , tossed his loosened hair with a proud flick , and swam the few strokes to the pool edge . But on his next dive Danny , aware we were all expecting another miracle , tensed up , lost thep143rhythm of the approach , came out of the one-and-a-half twist a moment too soon , and slapped the water with his back . One judge gave him a 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " my father said , " the poor kid gave it all he had . " And when Danny surfaced this time , my father , and only my father , clapped . The final score of the meet was West Alton 371/2 , Olinger i 8 . My father stood at the pool edge and said to his team , " I 'm proud of you . You 're damn good sports to come out for this at all  --  you get no glory and you get no pay . For a town without even an outdoor pool , I do n't see how you do as well as you do . If the high school had its own pool like West Alton does  --  and I do n't want to take any credit away from them  --  you 'd all be Johnny Weismuellers . In my book , you are already . Danny , that was one beautiful dive . I do n't expect to see a dive like that again as long as I live . " My father looked strange making this speech , standing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the vibratingturquoise water and beaded cream tiling framed his dark and earnest head as I saw it from the bleachers . Across the listening skin of the shoulders and chests of the team a nervous flicker now and then passed , swiftly as a gust across water , or a tic in the flank of a horse . Though they had lost , the team was boisterous and proud in their flesh , and we left them in the shower room carousing and lathering like a small herd joyfully caught in a squall . " Practice this Wednesday as usual , " my father had called to them in parting . " Do n't drink any milkshakes or eat more than four hamburgers before you show up . " Everyone laughed , and even I smiled , though my father was a heaviness upon me . In all the events of the night that followed there was this weight and inertia about him that blocked and snagged at every turnp144my simple plan , which was to get him home , where he would pass out of my care . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West Alton coach Foley caught up with us , and the two men talked for what seemed an hour . The damp air around the pool had put their suits out of press , and they seemed in the dimnessof the green hall two shepherds soaked in dew . " You 've done a superhuman job with those boys , " my father told Foley . " If I was one-tenth the coach you are we would have given you a run for your money . I have a few naturals this year . " " George now , no crap , " Foley replied , a thick sandy man all courtesy and ginger . " You know as well as me there 's no coaching to it ; let the tadpoles swim is all you can do . There 's a fish in every one of us , but you have to soak to get him out . " " That 's good , " my father said . " I never heard that before . Bud , how did you like my big man in the breast stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ; I hope you burned his ass for letting up like that . " " He 's dumb , Bud . I ) - U- M- B . The poor devil has no more brains than I do and I hate to bawl him out . " My throat rasped in sheer pressure of impatience . " You 've met my son , have n't you , Bud ? Peter , come over here and shake this man 's hand . This is the kind of man you should have had for a daddy . " " Why hell I know Peter , " Mr. Foley said , and there wassomething deeply agreeable about his handshake , gritty andwarm and easy . " The whole county knows Caldwell 's boy . " In their twilit world of Y. M. C. A.s and recreational programsand athletic banquets , this sort of wildly congratula/tort ' blarney passed for conversation ; I minded it less in Mr. Foley than in my father , whose affectation of it always seemed to me embarrassed . My father was for all his talk at heart a man of silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mood that has become in my memory silence . Once outside , his mouth made a firm line and his heels gathered in the pavement with a kind of aloof greed . I wonder if any man ever enjoyed walking in the small ugly cities of the East as much as my father . Trenton , Bridgeport , Binghamton , Johnstown , Elmira , Altoona : these were the cities where his work as cable splicer for the telephone company had taken him in the years before and the years just after he married my mother , the years before my birth and Hoover 's Depression stalled him in the sticks . He feared Firetown and felt uneasy in Olinger but adored Alton ; its asphalt and streetlights and tangent facades spoke to him of the great Middle Atlantic civilization , bounded by New Haven in the north and Hagerstown in the south and Wheelingin the west , which was his home in eternal space . To walk beside my father down Sixth Street was to hear the asphalt sing . I asked him how his X-ray had gone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It occurred to me that indeed I was ; the popcorn and the Jordan Almonds had settled into a sour aftertaste . We stopped at the trolley-shaped diner beside the Acme 's parking lot . My father conducted himself in the city with a simplicity that was soothing . My mother made too much of a decision of everything , as if she were trying to expressherself in a foreign language . Just so , in the country my father was confused in action and circuitous in thought . But here , in Alton at quarter after eight o'clock , he handled himself with the deftness , the expertness that is , after all , most ofp146what we hope for from fathers : the door pushed open , the glare and stares calmly blinked down , the two stools located side by side , the menu knowingly plucked from its place between the napkin dispenser and the catsup bottle , the countermanaddressed without stridence or equivocating , the sandwiches  --  hisa Western egg , mine a toasted ham  --  consumed in manful silence . My father quietly sucked the three central fingers of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napkin . " First time I 've felt like eating in weeks , " he said to me . In conclusion we ordered apple pie for me and coffee for him ; the check was a stiff green tab cryptically nipped by a triangular punch . I:Ic paid it with one of two dollar bills left in the worn hip wallet that had curved through the years to fit his haunch . As we rose my father noncommitally slipped , with a practiced flick of his wart-freckled hand , two dimes beneath his empty cup . And as an afterthought he bought for 65  --  one of the diner 's ready-made Italian sandwiches . It was to be a present for my mother . There was a vulgar side to my mother which apparently enjoyed smelly slippery Italian sandwiches and to which my father had , I saw jealously , more access than I. He paid for the sandwich with his last dollar and said , " That cleans me out , kid . You and I are penniless orphans . " Swinging the little brown paper bag , he walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brooding on its shadow . Its nose was tipped up the slope , toward the unseen tracks . Menthol like a vaporized moon suffused the icy air . The factory wall was a sheer cliff mixed of brick and black glass . The panes of glass were now and then mysteriously relieved by a pane of cardboard or tin . The brick did not yield its true color to the streetlamp that lit the area but instead showed as a diminu/tion of black , a withdrawn and deadly gray . This same light made the strange gravel here glitter . Compounded of coal chips and cinders , it made a loud and restless earth that never settled , crackling and shifting underfoot as if its destiny were to be perpetually raked . Silence encircled us . Not a window looking at us was lit , though deep in the factory a blue glint kept watch . My father and I could have been murdered in this place and until dawn no one would have known . Our bodies would lie in the puddles near the factory wall and our hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car was slow to start in the cold . Unh-uh , unh-uh , the engine grunted , at first briskly and then more and more slowly , self-discouraged . " Jesus , do n't quit on me now , " my father breathed in a dancing stream of vapor . " Start one more time and tomorrow I 'll get your battery charged . " Unnh-uh , unnnnh-ah . My father switched off the ignition and we sat in the dark . He made a loose fist and blew into it . " See , " I said , " if you 'd worn your gloves you 'd have ' em now . " " You must be frozen to death , " was his answer . " One more time , " he said , and switched the ignition back on and depressedthe starter button with his thumb . In the pause , the battery had gathered a little juice . It commenced hopefully . Ih-huh , Ih-huh , uh-uh , unnh-uh , unnhn-ah , uhhhh . We scraped the bottom of the battery . My father pulled the emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're in the soup . We 'll have to try a desperationmeasure . You get in behind the wheel , Peter , and I 'll get out and push . We have a little slope here but we 're pointed the wrong way . Put the car into reverse . When I shout , let the clutch out . Do n't ease it out , pop it out . "  | " Maybe we should get a garageman now , before they close , " I said . I was frightened of failing him . " Let 's give this a whirl , " he said . " You can do it . " He got out of the car and I slid over , accidentally sitting on my books and the paper bag containing the Italian sandwich for my mother . My father went to the front of the car and as he stooped to put his weight into it his grinning face burned yellow like a gnome 's . The light of the headlights cut across his face so sharply his forehead seemed all knobs and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he played football at college thirty years ago . My stomach clenched coldly as I checked the position of the gear shift and ignition switch and choke . At a nod from my father I released the emergency brake . Only the ovoid of his imbecile blue cap showed above the hood as he pitched his weight into the car . It did move backwards . The crunching of the tires on the gravel lifted in pitch ; grinding backwards we struck a little declivity that added a precious bit of momentum ; the Buick 's inertia for a moment tugged to be free of itself . In a piercing sob my father shouted , " Now ! " I popped out the clutch as I had been told to do . The car . snapped to a stop jaggedly ; but its motion was transferred through crusty knobs and clogged pivots to the engine , which , like a slapped baby , coughed . The motor gasped and shook the frame as its cylinders erraticallyexploded ; I pushed in the choke halfway , trying not to smother it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . Twitched out of tune , the motor missed one , two beats , and died . We were on the flat . Far away beyond the factory wall the door of a bar opened and a slat of light collapsed into the street.  |p149My  father flashed to my door and I lurched over , sickly ashamed . My body burned all over ; I needed to urinate . " Son of a bitch , " I said , to distract with my manliness my father from my failure . " You did O. K. , kid , " he said , panting with excitement as he resumed his place behind the wheel . " This engine 's stiff ; that may have loosened it up . " Delicately as a safecracker , his black silhouette picked at the dashboard as his foot probed the gas pedal . It had to be on the first try and it was . He found the spark again and nursed it into roaring life . I closed my eyes in thanks and relaxed into the coming motion of the car . It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rear of the chassis , where I imagined the corpses had been carried when the undertaker owned the car . My father 's shadow hurriedly tried all the gears ; to each the same faint and unmoving purr answered . He tried each gear twice in disbelief . The motor roared but the car did not move . The factorywall echoed back the frantic sustained crescendo of the cylinders and I was afraid men would be called toward us out of the distant bar . My father put his arms up on the wheel and lowered his head into them . It was a thing I had only ever seen my mother do . At the height of some quarrel or sadness she would crook her arms on the table and lower her head into them ; it frightened me more than any rage , for in the rage you could watch her face . " Daddy ? " My father did not answer . The streetlight touched with a row of steady flecks the curve of his knit cap : the way Vermeeroutlined a loaf of bread . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to me he had had an " attack " and the inexplicablebehavior of the car was in fact an illusionistic reflection of some breakage in himself . I was about to touch him  --  I never touched my father  --  when he looked up with a smile of sorts on his bumpy and battered urchin 's face . " This is the kind of thing , " he said , " that 's been happening to me all my life . I 'm sorry you got involved in it . I do n't know why the damn car does n't move . Same reason the swimming team does n't win , I suppose . " He raced the motor again and peered down past his knees at the clutch pedal as he worked it in and out with his foot . " I ) o you hear that little rattling behind ? " I asked . He looked up and laughed . " You poor devil , " he said . " You deserved a winner and you got a loser . Let 's go . If I never see this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He got out and slammed the door on his side so hard I thought the window might shatter . The black body swayed fastidiously on its obstinate wheels and then sat casting its paper-thinshadow as if it had won some inscrutable point . We walked away . " That 's why I never wanted to move to that farm , " my father said . " As soon as you do you become dependent upon automobiles . All I 've ever wanted is to be able to walk to where I had to go . My ideal is to walk to my own funeral . Once you 've sold out your legs , you 've sold out your life . " We walked across the railroad station parking lot and then turned left to the Esso station on Boone Street . The pumps were dark but a dim golden light burned in the little office ; my father looked in and tapped on the glass . The interior was crowded with raw new tires and spare parts in numberedp151boxes more or less arranged in a green metal frame . A great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if a body trapped inside had made its last effort . The electric Quaker State Oil clock on the wall said 9:o6 ; its second hand swept the full circle as we waited . My father tapped again , and there was still no answer . The only motion within was the second hand sweeping . I asked , " Is n't the one on Seventh Street an all-night place ? " He asked me , " how are you bearing up , kid ? This is a helluva thing , is n't it ? I ought to call your mother . " We walked up Boone and across the tracks and past the little porches of the brick row houses and thence up Seventh , across Weiser , which was n't so gaudy this high up , to where indeed the great garage was open . Its white mouth seemed to be drinking the night . Within , two men in gray coveralls , wearinggloves from which the fingers had been cut , were washing an automobile with pails of sudsy hot water . They worked quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice on the metal . The garage was open to the street at one end and at the other end faded into indeterminate caverns of parked cars . Along one wall a little booth , like a broader telephone booth or like one of those enclosed sheds in which people used to wait for trolley cars  --  there still was one in the town of Ely  --  , seemed to function as the heart of the place . Outside its door , on a little cement curb stencilled with the words STEP UP , a man in a tuxedo and white muffler waited , periodically consultingthe black-dialled platinum watch strapped to the inside of his wrist . His motions were so jerky and chronic that when I first spotted him in the corner of my eye I thought he was a lifesize mechanical ad . The car being washed , a pearl-gray Lincoln , was presumably his . My father stood in front of himp152for an instant and I saw from the quality of the man 's pearlgraygaze that my father was literally invisible to him . My father went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to follow him in . Here a thickset man was busily scrambling a table of papers . He was standing ; there was a desk chair to sit in but it was heaped to the arms with papers and pamphlets and catalogues . The man held a clipboard and a smoking cigarette in the same hand and was sucking his teeth as he searched through his papers . My father said , " I beg your pardon , my friend . " The manager said , " Just a minute please , give me a break , will ya ? " and , angrily wadding a piece of blue paper in his fist , plunged past us out the door . It was much more than a minute before he returned . To consume the time and conceal my embarrassment I fed a penny into the chewing-gum-ball machine installed by the Alton Kiwanis . I received , the rarest , the prize , a black ball . I loved licorice . So did my father . The time we went to New York my Aunt Alma had told me that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had called my father Sticks because he was always eating licorice sticks . " Do you want this ? " I asked him . " Oh God , " he said , as if in my palm I was holding out a pill of poison to him . " No thanks , Peter . That would just about finish my teeth on the spot . " And he began , in a way I can hardly describe , to rear and toss in the confined space of our cabin , turning to confront now a rack of road maps , now a detailedchart of spare part code numbers , now a calendar displayinga girl posed only in a snowbunny cap with pink pointed ears , mittens and booties of white fur , and a fluffy round tailpiece . Her bottom was pertly pointed outward at us.  |p153My  father groaned and pressed his forehead against the restrainingglass ; the man in the tuxedo turned around startled at the bump . The men in the fingerless gloves had climbed inside the Lincoln and were wiping the windows with busy swipes like the blur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the papers on the table as he strained to see where the manager had disappeared to . Afraid he would disturba mysterious order , I said sharply , " Daddy . Control your-self . " " I 've got the heebie-jeebies , kid , " he answered loudly . " Biff . Bang . I 'm ready to smash something . Time and tide for no man wait . This reminds me of death . " " Relax , " I said . " ' Take off your cap . He probably thinks you 're a panhandler . " He gave no sign of hearing me ; his communion was all with himself . His eyes had turned yellowish ; my mother sometimesscreamed when that amber gleam began to appear in his eyes . He looked at Inc with lifesaver irises lit by a ghost 's radiantgaze . His parched lips moved . " I can take anything by myself , " he told me . " But I 've got you on my hands . " " I 'm all right , " I snapped back , though in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the soles of my pinching loafers . I could hardly believe it , but in time the manager did return , and he listened politely to my father 's tale . He was a short thickset man with three or four parallel creases furrowing each cheek . He had the air  --  something about the set of his neck in his shoulders expressed it  --  of having once been an athlete . Now he was wearied and harassed by administration . His hair in thinning backwards had stranded a forelock , half-gray , which as he talked he kept brushing back brutally , as if top154scrub a new sense of focus into his head . His name , Mr. Rhodes , was stitched in a fat script of orange thread on the pocket of his olive coverall . He told us , speaking in hurried puffs between pronounced intakes of breath , " It does n't sound good . From what you say , the motor running and the car not moving , it 's in the transmission somewheres , or the driveshaft . If it was just the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said it it seemed to mean something different , something pulsingand living and lovable  --  " I 'd send the Jeep down , but this way , I do n't know what we can do . My tow truck 's off after a wreck down on Route 9 . Do you have a garage of your own ? " He accented " garage " on the first syllable : garritch . " We use AI I Iummcl over in Olinger , " my father said . " If you want me to get after your car in the morning , " Mr. Rhodes said , " I will . But I ca n't do anything before then ; these two "  --  he indicated the workmen in front of us ; they were flicking chamois pads across the Lincoln 's serene gray skin while the man in the tuxedo rhythmically slapped his palm with an alligator billfold  --  " go off at ten and that leaves just me and the two off in the wrecker down Route 9 . So it 'd be just as soon for you probably to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look after it first thing in the morning . " My father said , " In your considered opinion , then , as far as tonight goes , my goose is cooked ? " Mr. Rhodes confessed , " It do n't sound good , from how you describe it . " " There 's a little rattle in the back , " I said , " like two cog wheels spinning and just brushing against each other . " Mr. Rhodes blinked at me and brushed back his forelock . " It might be something in the axle . I 'd have to get it up on thep155rack and take apart the whole rear assembly . Do you live far ? " " Way the hell down in Firctown , " my father said . Mr. Rhodes sighed . " Well , yes . I 'm sorry I could n't be more help . " A long scarlet Buick , its paint a swirling cosmos of reflections , nosed in from the street and honked its horn : the blast totally possessed the low concrete cavern and Mr. Rhodes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Do n't apologize , mister . You 've told me what you think is the truth and that 's the greatest favor one man can do for another . " But outside the garage , again walking in the night , he said to me , " That poor devil did n't know what he was talking about , Peter . I 've been a bluffer all my life so I can spot another . He was what they call talking through your hat . I wonder how he got to be manager of an important place like that ; I bet he does n't know himself . He acted just the way I feel half the time . " " Where are we going now ? " " Back to the car . " " But it does n't go ! You know that . " " I know it and yet I do n't . I have the feeling it 'll go now . It just needed a rest . " " It is n't just the motor being cold , it 's something in the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me but I ca n't get it through my thick head . " " But it 's nearly ten o'clock . Should n't you call Mother ? " " What can she do ? We 're on our own , kid . The devil take the hindmost . " " Well I know perfectly well if the car did n't move an hour ago it wo n't move now . And I 'm freezing . " As we walked down Seventh , I hurrying and continuallyp156failing to close that gap of a step which was always between us , a drunk slipped out of a dark doorway and capered along beside us . For an instant I thought he was the hitchhiker , but this man was smaller and further gone in degeneracy . His hair was wild like the mane of a muddy lion and it stood straight out from his head like the rays of the sun . His clothes were preposterously tattered and he wore a frazzled old overcoat around his shoulders in the manner of a cape , so that its empty arms waved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , " Where arc you going with this boy ? " My father obligingly slowed his walk so that the drunk , who had stumbled in skipping sideways , could keep pace with us . " I beg your pardon , mister , " he said . " I did n't hear your question . " The drunk exercised an elaborate , pleased control over his intonation , like an actor marvelling at his own performance . " Oh ho ho , " he rumbled softly but distinctly . " You dirty , dirty man . " He waved his finger back and forth in front of his nose and peered at us roguishly through this windshieldwiperaction . For all his raggedness on this bitter night there was much that was merry about him ; his face was flat and hard and bright and his teeth were set in his grin like a row of small seeds . To me he said , " You go home , boy , home to your mother . " We had to stop or else bump into him . " This is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me to him so quickly all his clothes fluffed up like feathers . He seemed to be not so much dressed as shingled in rags , layer on layer of torn multi-textured scraps . His voice was like that , too , hoarse and broken and indefinitely soft . " How can you lie ? " he said sadly to myp157father . " How can you lie about a thing so serious ? Now let this boy go home to his mother . " " That 's where I 'm trying to take him , " my father said . " But the damn car wo n't start . " " He 's my father , " I said , hoping this would make the drunk go away . But it brought him closer to us . His face under the blue streetlight seemed splashed with purple . " Do n't lie for him , " he said with exquisite gentleness . " He 's not worth it . How much is he giving you ? I do n't care how much it is , it 's never enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out on the street like an old ' Trojan . " " Daddy , let 's go , " I said , frightened now , and chilled clear through . The night went in one side of me and came out the other and encountered no obstacle . My father began to push around him and the drunk lifted his hand and my father in answer lifted his own hand . This made the drunk take a back step and he nearly fell . " Knock me down , " the drunk said , smiling so broadly his cheeks gleamed . " Knock me down when I want to save your soul . Are you ready to die ? " This made my father jerk still like a halted movie . The drunk , seeing his triumph , repeated , " Are you ready to die ? " The drunk nimbly sidestepped to me and put his arm around my waist and gave me a hug . His breath was like the odor the seniors taking chemistry sometimes left in Room 107 before we came in for Thursday study hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , " he told me , " you 're a good warm body . But you 're all skin and bone . Does n't the old bastard feed you ? Hey , you , " he called to my father , " what sort of an old lech do you call yourself lifting these poor boys off the street with empty stomachs ? "  | " I thought I was ready to die , " my father said , " but now I wonder if anybody ever is . I wonder now if a **27;4225;TOOLONG with tuberculosis , gonorrhea , syphilis , and toothache is ready to die . " The drunk 's fingers began to gouge under my ribs and I jerked out of his grasp . " Daddy , let 's go . " " No , Peter , " my father said , " this gentleman is talking sense . Are you ready to die ? " he asked the drunk . " What do you think the answer is ? " Squinting , shoulders back , chest preening , the drunk with pigeon dignity stepped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him carefully , " I 'll be ready to die when you and everybody like you is locked up in jail and they throw away the key . You ca n't even let these poor kids rest on a night like this . " He looked over at me under frowning eyebrows and said , " Shall we call the cops , kid ? Let 's kill this old nance , huh ? " To my father he said , " What about it , chief ? How much is it worth to you not to have me call the cops and have you picked up with this flower ? " He inflated his chest as if to shout , but the street dwindled northward toward infinity without upholding another visible soul  --  just the painted brick fronts with the little railed porches characteristic of Alton , the stone stoops now and then bearing an ornamented cement flower-pot , the leafless curbside trees alternating and in the end mixing with the telephone poles . Parked cars lined this street but few passed down it because it met a dead end at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long low cement-block back of a brewery warehouse ; its corrugatedgreen doors had slammed tight shut and the memory of the clang seemed to make the air here hard . The drunk be/gan to pluck at my father 's chest , rubbing his thumb and fingersafter each pluck as if disposing of a louse or a piece of lint . " Ten dollars , " he said . " Ten dollars and my mouth is "  --  he pressed three blue fingers against his swollen violet lips and held them there as if testing how long he could hold his breath . At last he lifted them away , exhaled a huge feather of frozen vapor , smiled , and said , " So . Ten dollars buys me , lock , stock , and barrel . " He winked at me and asked , " Is that a bargain , kid , or not ? What 's he paying you ? " " He 's my father , " I insisted , frantic . My father was kneadinghis spotted hands together under the lamplight and the uprightnessof his posture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the next instant would fall . " Five dollars , " the drunk quickly said to him , " five lousy dollars , " and without waiting for an answer he dropped to , " one . One little bitty dollar bill so I can get myself a drink and stop freezing to death . Come on , chief , give me a break . I 'll even tell you a hotel where they do n't ask any questions . " " I know all about hotels , " my father said . " In the DepressionI took a job as night clerk at the old Osiris , before they closed it down . The bedbugs got to be as big as the prostitutes so the customers could n't tell ' em apart . I guess the Osiris was before your time . " The drunk lost his grin . " I come from Easton originally , " he said . It occurred to me with a shock that he was much younger than my father ; indeed he was virtually a boy like me . My father dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the young man . " I 'd like to give you more , my friend , but I just do n't have it . This is my last thirty-five cents . I 'm a public school teacher and our pay scale is way behindp160that of industry . I 've enjoyed talking to you , though , and I 'd like to shake your hand . " And he did . " You 've clarified my thinking , " he told the drunk . My father turned and walked back the way we had come , and I hurried to follow . The things we had been trying to reach  --  the 1lacic car , the sandstone house , my distant and by now , surely , intensely worried mother  --  tugged like weights within my skin , which seemed stretched transparent by starlightand madness . Walking this way we met the wind that had arisen , and a glass mask of cold was clipped onto my face . Behind us , the drunk kept calling , like an eagle muffled in a storm , " You 're O. K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we going ? " I asked . " To a hotel , " my father said . " That man brought me to my senses . We got ta get you into where it 's warm . You 're my pride and joy , kid ; we got ta guard the silver . You need sleep . " " We must call Mother , " I said . " Right you arc , " he said . " Right you are . " The repetition left me with the impression that he would n't do it . We turned left into Weiser Street . The wealth of neon there made the air seem warmer . One place was grilling hot dogs in the window . Figures liquid in the light poured past , shoulders hunched , faces hid . But they were people and their existing at all exhilarated me , came to me as a blessing and a permission to live myself . My father turned into a narrow doorway I had never noticed . Inside , up six steps and through a blank double door , a surprisingly high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some massive stairs and a few frayed chairs all sunk in on themselves and creased . On the left a kind of screen of potted plants held voices and a systematic clinkp161of glass on glass , like a flat bell ringing . There was an odor I had not smelled since , as a child , I would be sent on a Sunday evening to buy a paper pail of oysters at the place , halfrestaurant , half-general store , called Mohnie 's . Mohnie was a great sluggish Dutchman in a buttoned black sweater and his place was a whitewashed stone house that had stood here along the pike when the town was called Tilden . A bell rang when you pushed open the door and rang again when it shut behind you . Glum counters of exotic candies and tobaccos ran along one wall and in the rest of the space square tables with oilclothtablecloths waited for supper customers . In the meantimea few old men sat in the chairs , and I had supposed that the smell of the place was something they brought in with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather , and wood cured in dust , and the oysters themselves ; carrying the slippery little pail home , its top cleverly folded like a napkin at Sunday dinner , was like stealing a section of Mohnie 's air ; I used to feel that I was trailing behind me in the bluish evening air a faint brownish trail , a flavor of oysters that made the trees and houses of the pike subaqueous . Now here the smell was again , fresh . The clerk , a hunchback with papery skin and hands warped and made lump-knuckled by arthritis , put down his copy of Collier 's and listened , crinkled head cocked , as my father unfolded his wallet , elicited identification cards from it , and explainedthat he was George W. Caldwell , a teacher at Olinger High School , and that I was his son Peter , and that our car had broken down beside the Essick 's plant and our home was way the hell over in Firetown , and that we would like a room but did not have any money . A tall red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base I prepared to lie down and weep . The hunchback waved my father 's cards away and said , " I know you . I have a niece , Gloria Davis , goes to you . She thinks the world of Mr. Caldwell . " " Gloria 's a hell of a nice girl , " my father said limply . " A little wild , her mother thinks . " " I never noticed that . " " A little too fond of the boys . " " She 's always been the perfect lady with me . " The other man turned and selected a key tagged with a great wooden disc . " I 'll give you a room up on the third floor so the noise from the bar wo n't be a bother . " " I certainly appreciate this , " my father said . " Can I give you a check now ? " " Why not wait till morning ? " the little bent man asked , the dry skin of his face twinkling as he smiled . " I guess we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us up a narrow stairway with a lightly twisted bannister whose varnished surface undulated under my hand like a cat ecstatic at being stroked . The stairs wound around the caged elevator shaft , and vistas of spottily carpeted halls seemed to open at every landing . We went down one hall and our footsteps rattled in the gaps between carpets . At the end of the hall , beside a radiator and a window overlooking Weiser Square , the clerk applied the key to a door and it opened . Here was our destination : all night in ignorance we had been winding toward this room , with its two beds , its one window , its two bureaus , its one naked overhead bulb . The clerk switched the light on . My father shook his hand and told him , " You 're a gentleman and a scholar . We were thirsty , and ye gave us drink . " The clerk gestured with a shiny crippled hand . " The bath/room 's behind that door , " he said . " I think there 's a clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a good Samaritan , " my father said . " This poor kid here is ready to drop . " " I 'm not at all , " I said . Still irritated when the clerk had gone , I asked my father , " What 's the name of this awful place ? " " The New Yorker , " my father said . " It 's a real old-time flea-bag , is n't it ? " Now I had to argue with him on the other side , this seemed so ungrateful . " Well he was awfully nice to let us in when we did n't have any money . " " You never know who your real friends are , " he said . " I bet if that Davis bitch knew she did me a good turn she 'd be screaming in her sleep . " " Why do n't we have any money ? " I asked . " I 've been asking myself that for fifty years . The worst of it is , when I write them a check it 'll bounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When do you get paid ? Is n't this the middle of the month ? " " The way I 'm going , " my father said , " I never will get paid . The school board reads that report Zimmerman wrote they 'll be asking me for money . " " Oh who ever reads his reports ? " I snapped , angry because I did not know whether or not to undress in front of him . I was shy with him about my spots , because the sight of them seemed to trouble him so . But then , he was my father , and I draped my coat over a rickety , wired-together chair and began to unbutton my red shirt . He turned and gripped the doorknob . " I got ta get on the move , " he said.  | " Where are you going now ? Why ca n't you stay still ? " " I got ta call your mother and lock up the car . You go to sleep , Peter . We got you up too early this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to catch up on sleep since I was four years old . Can you go to sleep ? Should I bring your books back front the car so you can do some homework ? " " No . " I lc looked at me , and seemed on the verge of apology , confession , or a definite offer . There was a word  --  I did not know it but believed he did  --  that waited between us to be pronounced . But the only said , " I guess you can go to sleep . You do n't seem to have the jumps like I did when I was your age . " Tugging the door a touch impatiently , so that the halfretractedlarch raked the wood , he went out . The walls of an empty room are mirrors that double and redoubleour sense of ourselves . Alone , I felt highly excited , as if abruptly introduced into a company of the brilliant and famousand beautiful . I went to the room 's one window and overlooked the radiant tangle of Weiser Square . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trickling from all quarters of the city dammed . For two blocks Weiser was the broadest street in the East ; Conrad Weiser himself had set the surveyor 's sticks , planning in the eighteenth century a city of width , clarity , and ease . Now here headlights swam as if in the waters of a purple lake whose surface came to my sill . The shopfronts and bar signs made green and red grass along the banks . The windows of Foy 's , Alton 's great department store , were square stars set in six rows ; or like crackers made of two grains , the lower half of light yellow wheat and the upper half , where the tan shade was drawn , of barley or rye . Across the way , highest of all ,  |p165the  great neon owl by means of electric machinery winked and unwinked as a wing regularly brought to its beak , in a motionof three successive flashes , an incandescent pretzel . Beneathits feet , polychrome letters alternately proclaimed : OWl . PRETZELS " None Better " Owl , PRETZELS " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arrow , a trumpet , a peanut , a tulip  --  seemed to possess reflections in mid-air , to shimmer on the transparent plane that extended over the square at the height of my hotel room . Cars , stoplights , twinkling shadows that were people , all merged for me in a visual liquor whose fumes were the future . City . This was city : the room I stood alone in vibrated on its paper walls with the haloes of advertisement . Well hack from the window , seeing but unseen , I continued to undress , and the patches of scabbed skin I touched seemed the coarsely mottled outer petals of a delicate , delicious , silvery vegetable-heart I was peeling toward . I stood in my underpants , on the edge of a swim ; reeds and mud took the print of my bare feet ; Alton seemed herself already bathingin the lake of the night . The windowpane 's imperfections rippled the wet lights . A virginal sense of the forbidden welled over me like a wind and I discovered myself a unicorn . Alton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her shining hair fanned on the surface of the lake . My sense of myself amplified until , lover and loved , seer and seen , I compounded in several accented expansions my ego , the city ,  |p166and  the future , and during these seconds truly clove to the center of the sphere , and outmuscled time and tide . I would triumph . Yet the city shuffled and winked beyond the window unmoved , transparent to my penetration , and her dismissal dwindled me terribly . Hurrying as if my smallness were so many melting crystals which would vanish altogether if not gathered swiftly , I partially redressed and got into the bed nearest the wall ; the cold sheets parted like leaves of marble , and I felt myself a dry seed lost in the folds of earth . Dear God , forgive me , forgive me , bless my father , my mother , my grandfathcr , now let me sleep . As the sheets warmed , I enlarged to human size , and then , as the dissolution of drowsiness crept toward me , a sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells , and I seemed a giant who included in his fingernail all the galaxies that are . This sensation operated not only in space but in time ; it seemed , as literally as one says " a minute , " an eternity since I had risen from bed , put on my bright red shirt , stamped my foot at my mother , patted the dog through the frosted metal mesh , and drunk orange juice . These things seemed performed in photographs projected on a mist at the distance of the stars ; they mixed with Patricia Neal and Doris Day and via their faces I was returned to the bracing plane of everyday . I became aware of details : a distant rumble of voices , a spiral of wire holding together the leg of a chair a few feet from my face , the annoying flicker of lights on the walls . I got out of bed and lowered the shade and returned to bed . How warm the room was , compared with my room at Firetown ! I thought of my mother and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cereal and to forget myself in watching her plod back and forth in our kitchen . When I saw her again Ip167must tell her I understood why she moved us to the farm and that I did not blame her . And I must show my grandfather more respect and listen when he talks because ... because .. . he will not always he with us . My father seemed to come into the room at this moment , so I must have fallen asleep . My lips felt swollen , my bare legs boneless and long . I Lis great shadow cut across the strip of pink light that the lowered shade left standing along the wall by the corner . I heard him set my books down on our table : " You asleep , Peter ? " " No . Where have you been ? " " I called your mother and Al Hummel . Your mother tells me to tell you not to worry about anything , and Al 's going to send his truck in for the car in the morning . He thinks it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-hand parts for me . " " How do you feel ? " " O. K. I was talking to an awfully nice gentleman downstairs in the lobby ; he travels all over the East consulting with these big stores and companies about their advertising programsand clears twenty thousand a year with a two-month vacation . I told him that was the kind of creative work you were interested in and he said he 'd like to meet you . I thought of coming up to get you but figured you could probably use the sleep . " " Thanks , " I said . His shadow cut back and forth across the light as he took off his coat , his tie , his shirt . His voice chuckled . " The hell with him , huh ? I guess that 's the attitude to take . A man like that would walk over your dead body to grab a nickel . That 's the kind of bastard I 've done business with all my life ; they 're too smart for me. "  |p168When  he got into bed , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause , and he said , " Do n't worry about your old man , Peter . In God we trust . " " I 'm not worried , " I said . " Good night . " There was another pause , and then the darkness spoke : " Pleasant dreams , as Pop would say . " And his evoking my grandfather unexpectedly did make this strange room safe enough to sleep in , though a woman 's voice giggled down the hall , and doors kept slamming above and below us . My sleep was simple and deep and my dreams scanty . When I awoke , all I remembered was being in an endless chemical laboratory , like a multiplication with mirrors of the basins and test tubes and Bunsen burners in Room 107 at Olinger High . There was on a table a small Mason jar such as my grandmotherused to put up applesauce in . Its glass was clouded . I picked it up and put my ear to the lid and heard a tiny voice , as high in pitch as the voice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microscopic distinctness , " I want to die . I want to die . " My father was already up and dressed . He stood by the window , its shade raised , and looked down at the city stirring itselfinto the gray morning . The sky was not clear ; clouds like the undersides of long buns unrolled beyond the brick horizonof the city . He opened a window , to savor Alton , and the air tasted different from yesterday 's : milder , preparatory , stirred . Something had moved nearer . Downstairs , our clerk had been replaced by a younger man , who stood straight and did not smile . " Has the old gentleman gone off duty ? " my father asked . " It 's a funny thing , " the new clerk said , without smiling at all . " Charlie died last night . " " Huh ? How could he do that ? "  | " I do n't know . It happened around two in the morning , they said . I was n't supposed to come on until eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the iucn 's room and died on the floor . Heart , it must have been . Did n't the ambulance wake you ? " " Was that siren for my friend ? I ca n't believe what you 're saying . He was a wonderful Christian to us . " " I did n't know him very well myself . " The clerk accepted my father 's check only after a long explanation , and with a doubtful grimace . My father and I scraped together the change in our pockets and found enough for breakfast at a diner . I had one dollar in my wallet but did not tell him , intending it to be a surprise when things got more desperate . The counter of the diner was lined with workmen soft-eyed and gruff from behind halfasleepstill . I was relieved to see that the man working the griddle was not our hitchhiker . I ordered pancakes and bacon and it was the best breakfast I had had in months . My father ordered Wheaties , mushed the cereal into the milk , ate a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clock . It said 7:25 . He bit back a belch ; his face whitened and the skin under his eyes seemed to sink against the socket bone . He saw me studyinghim in alarm and said , " I know . I look like the devil . I 'll shave in the boiler room over at school , Heller has a razor . " The pale grizzle , like a morning 's frost , of a day-old beard covered his cheeks and chin . We left the diner and walked south toward the high dull owl of dead tubing . A tenuous winter mist , released by the rise in temperature , licked the damp cement and asphalt . We boarded a trolley at Fifth and Weiser . The interior was gay with the straw of the seats , and warm and nearly empty . Few other people were heading outwards against the pull of thep170city . Alton thinned ; the row houses split like ice breaking ; a distant hill was half tranced green and half new pastel houses ; and after the long gliding stretch beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cone , the motley brick houses of Olinger took hold around us . The school grounds and then the salmon-brick school appeared on the left ; the boilerhouse smokestack admonished the sky like a steeple . We got our by Hummel 's Garage . Our Buick was not there yet . We were not late today ; cars were still nosing into their slots . An orange bus racily heaved through a loop and swayed to a stop ; students the size of birds , colored in bright patches , no two alike , tumbled from the doors in pairs . As my father and I strode along the pavement that divided the school side lawn from Hummel 's alley , a little whirlwind sprang up before us and led us along . Leaves long dead and brittle as old butterfly wings , an aqua candy wrapper , flecks and dust and seed-sized snips of gutter chaff all hurried in a rustling revolution under our eyes ; a distinctly circular invisiblepresence outlined itself on the walk . It danced from one margin of grass to another and sighed its senseless word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striding . His pants flapped , something sucked my ankles , I closed my eyes . When I looked behind us , the whirlwind was nowhere to be seen . In the school we parted . A student , I was held by regulations to this side of the wire-reinforced doors . He pushed through and walked down the long hall , his head held high , his hair fluffed from the removal of his blue knit cap , his heels poundingthe varnished boards . Smaller and smaller he grew along their perspective ; at the far door he became a shadow , a moth , impaled on the light he pressed against . The door yielded ; he disappeared . With a grip of sweat , terror seized me.  |p171GEORGE  W. CALDWELL , TEACHER , 50 . Mr. Caldwell was born December 21st , 1896 , on Staten Island , New York City . His father was the Reverend John Wesley Caldwell , a graduate of Princeton University and the Union Theological Seminary , New York . Upon graduation from the latter place he entered the Presbyterian ministry , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caldwell family to this denomination . His wife , nee Phyllis Harthorne , was of Southern extraction , hailing from the near environs of Nashville , Tennessee . To their marriage she not only brought her great personal beauty and charm but the energetic piety characteristic of Southern gentlewomen . Countless parishioners were to stand indebted to her example of devotion and Christian testimony ; when , at the tragically early age of forty-nine , her husband was called to move " from strength to strength " in the Higher Service , it was she who , in the difficult year of his lingering illness , carried on the work of the church , on several Sundays herself mounting into the pulpit . The couple was blessed with two offspring , of which George was the second . In March of 1900 , when George was three , his father resigned his Staten Island pastorate and accepted the call of the First Presbyterian Church of Passaic , New Jersey , at the corner of Grove Street and Passaic Avenue  --  a splendid structure of yellow limestone still standing andp172recently enlarged . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed his learning , wry wit , and firmly held faith upon the upturned faces of his flock . So it was that Passaic , of old called Acquackanonk , a gentle river town whose rural beauties were at that time far from eclipsed by the vigor of its industry , came to be the seat of George Caldwell 's rearing . M:inv still living in this city remember him as a cheerful boy , adept at all sports and as skilled in retaining friends as at making then . His nickname was " Sticks "  --  presumably an allusionto an unusual physical thinness . Following his father 's intellectual bent , he showed an early interest in formal science , though in later years he claimed , with the joking modesty so intrinsic to the man , that the height of his ambition was to become a druggist . Fortunately for a generation of Olinger students , Fate decreed otherwise . Mr. Caldwell 's young manhood was troubled by the prematuredeath of his father and by America 's participation in the First ' World War . An instinctive and natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divisionlate in 1917 and narrowly survived , at Fort Dix , the great flu epidemic which was then sweeping the camps . He stood ready , Serial No. 2414792 , for overseas duty when the Armistice was declared ; George Caldwell would never again come so close to leaving the continental boundaries of the nation he was to enrich as worker , teacher , churchman , civic leader , son , husband , and father . In the years following his military discharge , George Caldwell , now  --  with his sister , who had married  --  his mother 's sole support , was engaged at a variety of jobs : as a door-to-door salesman of encyclopedias , as the driver of a sightseeing busp173in Atlantic City , as athletic supervisor in the Paterson Y. M. C. A. , as a railroad fireman on the New York , Susquehanna , and Western Line , and even as a hotel bellhop and restaurant dishwasher . In 1920 he enrolled in Lake College , near Philadelphia , and , with no financial assistance save that engendered by his own efforts , succeeded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While compilingan excellent academic record and sustaining a demandingschedule of part-time employment , he as well earned an athletic scholarship that reduced his tuition by half . For three years a guard on the Lake football varsity , he suffered a broken nose a total of seventeen times , a severely dislocated kneecap twice , and a leg and a collarbone fracture once each . It was there , on the lovely campus whose central jewel is the shiningoak-lined lake deemed sacred by the Lenni Lenape ( the " Original People " ) , that he met and was enchanted by Miss Catherine Kramer , whose family were indigenous to the Fire Township region of Alton County . In 1926 the couple married , in Hagerstown , Maryland , and for the next half-decade travelled widely through the Middle Atlantic States including Ohio and West Virginia , George being employed , as cable splicer , by the Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company . " Blessings come in strange disguises . " In 1931 the national destiny again intruded upon the personal ; due to the economic disturbances sweeping the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the industrial giant he had so conscientiously served . He and his wife , who was shortly to enlarge George Caldwell 's responsibilities by another human soul , came to live with her parents , in Olinger , where Mr. Kramer had several years before purchased the handsome white brick house on Buchanan Road presently occupied byp174Dr . Potter . In the fall of 1933 Mr. Caldwell took up teaching duties at Olinger High School , duties he was never to put down . How to express the quality of his teaching ? A thorough mastery of his subjects , an inexhaustible sympathy for the scholastic underdog , a unique ability to make unexpected connections and to mix in an always fresh and eye-opening way the stuff of lessons with the stuff of life , an effortless humor , a by no means negligible gift for dramatization , a restless and doubting temperament that urged him forward ceaselessly towardself-in1provcment in the pedagogic craft  --  these are only parts of the whole . What endures , perhaps , most indelibly in the minds of his ex-students ( of whom this present writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total concern for the world at large which left him , perhaps , too little margin for self-indulgence and satisfied repose . To sit under Mr. Caldwell was to lift up one 's head in aspiration . Though there was sometimes  --  so strenuous and unpatterned was his involvement with his class  --  confusion , there was never any confusion that indeed " Here was a man . " In addition to a full load of extra-curricular school activities , including the coaching of our gallant swimming team , the management of all football , basketball , track and baseball tickets , and the supervision of the Communications Club , Mr. Caldwell played a giant 's role in the affairs of the community . He was secretary of the Olinger Boosters ' Club , Counsellor to Cub Pack 12 , member of the Committee to Propose a Borough Park , vice-president of the Lions and chairman of that service club 's annual light-bulb-selling campaign for the benefit of blind children . During the recent War he was Block Wardenp175and a willing instrument in many aspects of the Effort . Born a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lutheran , and was a staunch contributor to both causes . For many years a deacon and church-council member of the RedeemerLutheran Church of Olinger , upon recently moving to a charming rural house in Firetown , his wife 's family " homestead , " Mr. Caldwell promptly became a deacon and member of the council of the Firetown Evangelical-Lutheran church body . Such a tabulation by its very nature can not include the countless nameless works of charity and good will by which he , originally an alien to the town of Olinger , wove himself so securely into its fabric of citizenship and fellowship . He is survived by a sister , Alma Terrio , of Troy , New York ; and by his father-in-law , his wife , and his son , all of Firetown . AS I LAY ON MY ROCK various persons visited me . First came Mr. Phillips , my father 's colleague and friend , his hair indented by the memory of a shortstop 's cap . He held up his hand for attention and made me play that game which hep176believed made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said rapidly , " add four , multiply by three , subtract six , divide by two , add four , what do you have ? " " Five ? " I said , for I had become fascinated by the nimblenessof his lips and so lost track . " Ten , " he said , with a little rebuking shake of his inflexibly combed head . Ile was a tidy man in all things , and any sign of poor coordination vexed him . " Take six , " he said , " divide by three , add ten , multiply by three , add four , divide by four , what do you have ? " " I do n't know , " I said miserably . My shirt was eating my skin with fire . " Ten , " he said , puckering sadly his rubbery mouth . " Let 's get down to business , " he said . He taught social science . " Give me the members of Truman 's cabinet . Remember the magicmnemonic phrase , St. Wapnical . " " State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I could remember no more . " But truly , " I called , " tell me , Mr. Phillips , you 're his friend . Is it possible ? Where can the spirits go ? " " T , " he said , " Thanatos . Thanatos the death-demon carries off the dead . Two and three , Billy boy , easy out , easy out . " He adroitly sidestepped and stooped and snatched it up in his webbing on the short hop . He braced , pivoted in slow motion , and lobbed it over . It was a volley ball and behind me all the mountaintops began to shout . I strained to bat it back over the net but my wrists were chained with ice and brass . The ball grew eyes and a mane of hair like the cornsilk that flows from the bursting ear . Deifendorf 's face moved so close I could smell the tallow on his breath . He was holding his hands so a little lozenge-shaped crevice was formed between the balls of his palms . " What they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to have you inp177there . No matter who they are , that 's all they like , you in there working back and forth . " " It seems so brutal , " I said . " It 's disgusting , " he agreed . " But there it is . Back and forth , back and forth ; nothing else , Peter  --  kissing , hugging , pretty words  --  it does n't touch them . You have to do it . " He took a pencil into his mouth and showed me how , bending his face into the conjunction of his palms with the pencil sticking , eraser first , from his tartarish teeth . For this moment of tender attention a whole hushed world seemed conjured in the area of his breathing . Then he straightened up , and broke his palms apart , and stroked the two fatnesses of his left palm . " If there 's too much fat here , " he said , " along the inside of the thighs , you 're blocked  --  you understand ? " " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itching arms , where the red shirt was shredding . " So do n't laugh off the lean pieces , " Deifendorf admonished me , and the dense seriousness of his face repelled me , for I knew it won my father . " You take a skinny kid like Gloria Davis , or one of these big rangy types like Mrs. Hummel  --  I mean , when a piece like that takes you , you do n't feel so lost . Hey , Peter ? " " What ? What ? " " Wan na know how to tell if they 're passionate ? " " Yes , I do . I really do . " He stroked the ball of his thumb lovingly . " Right in here . The mound of Venus . The more there is , the more they are . " " The more they are what ? " " Do n't be dumb . " He punched me in the ribs so that I gasped . " And another thing . Why doncha get some pants without a yellow stain on the fly ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caucasus laughing and snapping their towels and flipping their silvery genitals . Now the town came to visit me , daubed with Indian paint and vague-faced from idle weeping . " You remember us , " I said . " How we used to walk up the pike beside the trolley cars , me always hurrying a little to keep up ? " " Remember ? " He touched his cheek in confusion , so that dabs of wet clay rubbed off on his fingertips . " There are so many . . . " " Caldwell , " I said . " George and Peter . He taught at the high school and when the war was over he was Uncle Sam and led the parade down from the fire hall down the pike , where the trolley tracks used to be . " " There was somebody , " he said , his eyelids trembling in a sleep-walker 's concentration , " a stout man ... " " No , a tall man . " " You all imagine , " he said with sudden vexation , " if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I . . . that I . . . there are thousands . There have been thousands , there will be thousands ... First , the People . Then the Welsh , the Quakers , the Germansfrom the Tulpehocken Valley . . . and all think that I should remember them . In fact , " he said , " my memory is poor . " And with this confession his face was brightened by a quick smile that , creasing so counter to the earth-colored markings of paint on his face , made me love him for a second even in his weakness . " And the older I get , " he went on , " the more they stretch me , the streets up Shale Hill , the new developmenttoward Alton , the more . . . I do n't know . The less things seem to matter . " " He was in the Lions , " I prompted . " But they never madep179him president . He was on the committee to get a borough park . He was always doing good deeds . He loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend a lot of time hanging around Hummel 's Garage , on the corner there . " His eyes were closed and , following the pattern of his lids , his whole face seemed membranous and distended , flickering with fine veins but rapt as a death-mask is rapt . The daubs of paint glistened where they had not dried . " When did they straighten Hummel 's Alley ? " he murmured to himself . " There had been a woodworking shop there , and that man blinded by gas in the trenches in that little shack , and now I see a man coming into the alley . . . His coat pocket is full of old pens that do n't write . . . " " That 's my father ! " I cried . He shook his head crossly and let his lids slowly lift . " No , " he told me , " it 's nobody . It 's the shadow of a tree . " He grinned and took from his pocket a winged maple seed , which he expertlysplit with his thumbnail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , so it made a little green rhinoceros horn there . The effect , in combination with the ochre paint , was suddenly malevolent , and he stared at me for the first time directly , his eyes as black as oil or loam . " You see , " he pronounceddistinctly , " you moved away . You should n't have moved away . " " It was n't my fault , my mother  --  " The bell rang . It was time for lunch , but no food was brought me . I sat opposite Johnny Dedman and there were two others with us . Johnny dealt us cards . Since I could not pick mine up , he flashed each one in my face , and I saw that they were not ordinary cards . Each of them had instead of central pips a murky photograph.  |p180A  0 : woman , white , not young , sitting on a chair smiling , naked , legs spread . J ' : 2 : female white and male Negro performing that act of mutual adoration vulgarly known as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement , female-male alternately , one Negro , three white , performing cunnilingus and fellatio alternately , blurred by the necessarily considerable reduction under cheap engraving process , so some details were not as clear as I avidly wished . To cover my confusion I coolly asked , " Where did you get these ? " " Cigar store in Alton , " Johnny said . " You have to know the man . " " Are there really fifty-two different ones ? It seems fan-tastic . " " All except this one , " he said , and showed me the Ace of Spades . It was simply the Ace of Spades . " How disappointing . " " But if you look at it upside down , " he said ; and it was an apple with a thick black stem . I did n't understand . I begged , " Let me see the other cards . " Johnny looked at me with his wise look , his fuzzy cheeks lightly aflame . " Not so fast , my little teacher 's son , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have no money . Last night we had to stay at a hotel and my father had to give the man a check . " " You have a dollar . You held out on the old bastard . You have a dollar in your wallet in your hip pocket . " " But I ca n't reach it ; my arms are fastened . " " All right then , " he said . " Buy your own cards , you little flute . " And he put his in the pocket of his shirt , which was forest-green , of a beautifully coarse weave , with the collarp181turned up so its edge rubbed the nape of his wet-combed hair . I tried to get at my wallet ; my shoulder muscles ached in their frozen sockets ; my back seemed welded to the rock . Penny  --  it was she beside me , giving off a columbine hint of perfume  --  nuzzled my neck as she tried to reach my wallet for me . " Let it go , Penny , " I told her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to eat in town tonight because of the basketball game . " " Why did you ever move into the country ? " she asked . " It sets up all these inconveniences . " " True , " I said . " But it also gives me a chance at you . " " You never take advantage of it , " she said . " I did once , " I said , blushing in defence . " Oh , shit , Peter , here , " Johnny sighed . " Now do n't say I never did you a favor . " He ruffled through the deck and showed me the Jack of Hearts again . It seemed very beautiful , a circle completed , a symmetry found , a somber whirlpool of flesh , the faces hidden by the woman 's white thighs and the woman 's long loose hair . But the beauty of it , like a black pencilrubbed over paper to bring out the buried initials and inscriptionslong ago carved on a desk-top , brought up again my sorrow and fear over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show ? " I asked , I hoped casually . He shrugged and after a little hum of calculation said , " Fifty-fifty . It could go either way . " " Oh my Lord , " Penny cried , her fingertips darting to her lips . " I forgot to pray for him ! " " That 's O. K. , " I said . " Forget it . Forget I ever asked you . Just gim me a bite of your hamburger . Just a little bite . " All the cigarette smoke was bothering my face ; I felt as I opened my mouth I was taking sulphur into myself.  | " Easy , easy , " Penny said . " This is all I have for lunch . " " You 're kind to me , " I said . " Why ? " It was not really a question , I was just trying to draw her out . " What do you have next period ? " Kegerise asked in his ugly flat voice . He was the fourth . " Latin . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could I , I spent the whole screwed-up night gallivanting with my father up and down the streets of Alton . " " Miss Appleton will love to hear that , " Kegerise said . He envied my brains . " Oh , I think she 'll forgive anything a Caldwell does , " Penny said . She had a mood of slyness which I detested ; she was not very clever and it did not become her . " That 's an odd thing to say , " I said . " Does it mean any-thing ? " " Have n't you noticed ? " Her green eyes went quite round . " The way your father and Hester stand around in the hall talking ? She thinks he 's wonderful . " " You 're mad , " I said . " You 're really sex-mad . " Meant to be cute , to my surprise it miffed her . " You do n't notice anything , do you , Peter ? You 're just so wrapped up in your own skin you have no idea what other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but I was sure she knew nothing about my skin . My face and hands were clear and she had never seen anything else . This troubled me and made her love frightening ; for if she loved me we would be driven to make love and there would come this very painful time when I must expose to her my flesh . . . Forgive me , my brain suddenly began murmuring , forgive me , forgive me . Johnny Dedman , irritated at being left out of the conversation  --  afterall , he was a senior and we were sophomores so hisp183being with us was a considerable condescension  --  riffled through his dirty pack and ostentatiously chuckled . " The one that really kills me , " he said , " is the whore of farts . I mean the four of hearts . It 's a woman and a bull . " Minor charged over to our booth . Anger flashed from his bald dome and steamed through his flared nostrils . " Here , hyaar , " he snorted . " Put those away . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dedman looked up at him with a benign flicker of the long curling eyelashes that gave his gaze a starry expectancy . He spoke with his lips hardly moving . " Go chop some horsemeat , " he said . Miss Appleton seemed rather flustered and out of breath , probably from the long climb . " Peter , translate , " she said , and then she read aloud with her impeccable quantities , " Dixit , et avertens rosea cervice refulsit , ambrosiaeque comae divinum vertice odorem spiravere , pedes vestis defluxit ad imos , et vera incessu patuit dea . " As she made these words ring , she wore her Latin face : cornersof the lips sternly downdrawn , eyebrows lifted rigidly , her cheeks gray with gravity . In French class , her face was quite different : cheeks like apples , eyebrows dancing , mouth puckereddryly , corners tense naughtily . " She said , " I said . " She spoke . Thus she spoke , " Miss Appleton said . " She spoke , and . . . and . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cervice glowed . " " She spoke , and , turning , her , uh , rosy crevice  --  " Laughter from the others . I blushed.  | " No ! Cervice , cervice . Neck . You 've heard of the cervix . Surely you 've heard of the cervical vertebrae . " " She spoke , and , turning  --  " " As she turned . " " As she turned , her rosy neck blushed . " " Very well . " " And , and coma , coma  --  sleep ? " " Hair , Peter , hair . Surely you 've heard of the derivative word comose ? Think of comb , as a rooster 's comb . " " And , uh , turning again  --  " " Oh , no . Dear child , no . Vertice here is the noun , vertex , verticis . Vortex . A vortex , a whirl , a crown of hair , of what kind of hair ? What agrees ? " " Ambrosial . " " Yes , ambrosial meaning , properly , immortal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in that sense descending to us with the meaning of sweet , delicious , honey-like . But the gods also used ambrosia for anointment and perfume . " She spoke of the gods with a certain authority , Miss Appleton did . " And her whirl , her tangle  --  " " Crown , Peter . The hair of the gods is never tangled . " " And her crown of ambrosial hair breathed out a divine odor . " " Yes . Good . Fragrance , let 's say . Odor rather suggests plumbing . " " ... a divine fragrance , her vestment , her robe ... " " Yes , a flowing robe . All the goddesses save Diana wore a loose flowing robe . Diana , the heavenly huntress , wore of course a sensible tunic , perhaps with leggings , probably of a heavy green or brown cloth such as what I am wearing . Her robe flowed down  --  "  | " I do n't understand ad imos . " " Imus , a rather archaic word . The superlative of inferus , below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremity . Here , literally , to the lowest extremity of her feet , which makes little sense in English . It is used as emphasis ; the poet is astounded . Some rendering such as her robe flowed down , ah , down to her very feet ' might be equivalent . The sense is of all the way . ' She was totally naked . Please proceed , Peter . This is taking much too long . " " Down , down to her feet , and in truth opened  --  " " Was opened , was exposed , made manifest as vera . Vera dea . " " As a true goddess . " " Quite so . What does incessu have to do with the sentence ? " " I do n't know . " " Really , Peter , this is disappointing . College material like yourself . Incessu , in stride , in gait . She was in gait a true goddess . Gait in the sense of carriage , of physical style ; there is a style to divinity . These lines brim with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknowing Aeneas . Ille ubi matrem agnovit ; he recognized his mother . Venus , Venus with her ambrosial fragrance , her swirling hair , her flowing robe , her rosy skin . Yet he sees only as she is avertens , as she is turning away . The sense of the passage being that only as she turns to leave him , does he perceive her true glory , her actual worth and her relationship to him . So it is often in life . We love too late . In the next lines he cries out to her , most movingly , as she fades away , Oh why , why may we never join hand to hand , or hear and give back speech truly ? ' " Iris Osgood replaced her ; the girl was crying . Tears streamed down her cheeks , soft and bland like the sides of ap186Guernsey , and she did not have the wit to wipe them away . She was one of those dull plain girls who was totally unfashionablein the class and yet with whom I felt a certain inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard seeds in me ; I showed it by being quick and banteringof tongue . But today I was tired and wanted only to pillow my head upon her low I. Q. " Why the tears , Iris ? " Through a sob in her throat she brought out , " My blouse : he tore it . It 's ruined and what can I tell my mother ? " And now I noticed that indeed the downslipping silver of one breast was exposed to the very verge of its ruddy puckeredcoin ; I could not quite tear my eyes away , it looked so vulnerable . " That 's all right , " I told her , debonair . " Look at me . My shirt is totally disintegrated . " And this was true ; except for flecks and glutinous threads of red , my chest was bare . My psoriasis was made manifest . A line had formed and , one by one , they walked by , Betty Jean Shilling , Fats Frymoyer , Gloria Davis suppressing a smile , Billy Schupp the diabetic  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each for a moment studied my scabs , and then moved on in silence . A few shook their heads sadly ; one girl pressed her lips together and shut her eyes ; a few eyes were thick and pink with tears . The wind , the mountaintops , had fallen still behind me . My rock felt padded and there was a tangy chemical smell all but smothered in the artificial perfume of flowers . Last came Arnie Werner , the president of the senior class and the student council , captain of the football and baseball teams . He was a hollow-eyed boy with the throat of a god andp187heavy sloping shoulders all shining from the shower . He bent way over and stared at the scabs of my chest and touched one fastidiously with his index finger . " Jesus , kid , " he said , " what 've you got ? Syphilis ? " I tried to explain . " No , it 's an allergic condition , not contagious , do n't be frightened  --  " " Have you had a doctor look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the doctor himself  --  " " Does it bleed ? " he asked . " Only when I scratch too hard , " I told him , desperate to ingratiate myself , to earn his forgiveness . " It 's kind of relaxing , actually , when you 're reading or in a movie  --  " " Boy , " he said . " This is the ugliest stuff I ever saw . " He frowningly sucked his index finger . " Now I 've touched it and I 'll get it . Where 's the Mercurochrome ? " " Honest , cross my heart , it 's not contagious  --  " " Frankly , " he said , and from the solemn-dumb way he said that one word I could see that he was probably a good president of the student council , " I 'm surprised they let you bring a thing like that into the school . If it 's syphilis , you know , the toilet seats  --  " I shouted , " I want my father ! " He came before me and wrote on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E.It was the last , the seventh period of the day . We were tired . He encircled the E and said , " Energy . That 's life . That little extra E is life . We take in sugars and oxygen and burn it , like you burn old newspapers in the trash barrel , and give off carbondioxide and water and energy . When this process stops "  |p188he  Xed through the equation  --  " this stops "  --  he double-Xed out the E  --  " and you become what they call dead . You become a worthless log of old chemicals . " " But ca n't the process ever be reversed ? " I asked . " Thanks for asking that , Peter . Yes . Read the equation backwardsand you have photosynthesis , the life of green plants . They take in moisture and the carbon dioxide we breathe out and the energy of the sunlight , and they produce sugar and oxygen , and then we eat the plants and get the sugar back and that 's the way the world goes round . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . " Round and round , and where it stops , nobody knows . " " But where do they get the energy ? " I asked . " Good question , " my father said . " You 've got your mother 's brains ; I hope to hell you do n't get my ugly face . The energy needed for photosynthesis comes from the atomic energy of the sun . Every time we think , move , or breathe , we 're using up a bit of golden sunshine . When that gives out in five billion years or so , we can all lie down and rest . " " But why do you want to rest ? " His face had gone quite bloodless ; a film had been interposed between us ; my father seemed flattened upon another plane and I strained my voice to reach him . He turned slowly , so slowly , and his forehead wobbled and elongated with refraction . His lips moved and seconds later the sound came to me . " Huh ? " He was not looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't rest ! " I shouted , glad the tears had come , glad to hear my voice breaking on the spikes of grief ; I hurled my words through with a kind of triumph , exulted in the sensations of the tears softly flailing my face like the torn ends of shatteredp189ropes . " Daddy , do n't rest ! What would you do ? Ca n't you forgiveus and keep going ? " The top half of him was bent by some warp in the plane he was caught in ; his necktie and shirtfront and coat lapels looped upwards along the curve and his head at the end of the arc was pressed into the angle where the wall met the ceiling above the blackboard , a cobwebby place never touched by a broom . From up here his distorted face gazed down at me mournfully , preoccupied . Yet a microscopic pinch of interest in the corners of his eyes led me to keep calling . " Wait ! Ca n't you wait for me ? " " Huh ? Am I going too fast ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Huh ? " His voice was so muffled and far that I willed to be closer to him and found myself swimming upward , with expert strokes , my arms lifting high at the elbow , my feet fluttering like bonelessfins . The sensations so excited me I almost forgot to speak . Coming up panting by his side , I told him , " I have hope . " " Do you ? That makes me awfully proud to hear that , Peter . I never had any . You must get that from your mother , she 's a real femme . " " From you , " I said . " Do n't worry about me , Peter . Fifty years is a long time ; if you do n't learn anything in fifty years you never will . My old man never knew what hit him ; he left us a Bible and a bucketfulof debts . " " Fifty years is not a long time , " I said . " It 's not enough . " " You really have hope , huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I " inside my headp190and the trembling plane of darkness also there , there was a gap , of indeterminate distance but certainly not more than an inch . With a little lie I leaped it . " Yes , " I said . " Now stop being silly . " VIICALDWELL turns and shuts the door behind him . Another day , another dollar . He is weary but does not sigh . The hour is late , after five . He has stayed in his room bringing the basketballbooks up to date and trying to unravel the tickets ; there is a block of tickets missing and in rummaging through his drawershe came across Zimmerman 's report and reread it . It depressedhim out of all proportion . It was on blue paper and looking at it was like falling upwards into the sky . Also he has corrected the exams he gave the fourth section today . Poor Judy Lengel : she does n't have it . She tries too hard and maybe that has been his trouble all his life . As he walks toward the stairwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a folded wing . Some have the five talents , some have the two , some have the one . But whether you 've worked in the vineyardall day or just an hour , when they call you in your pay is the same . He hears his father 's voice in the memory of these parables and this depresses him further . " George . " A shadow is in the corner of his eye.  | " Huh ? Oh . You . What are you doing here so late ? " " Fussing . That 's what old maids do . Fuss . " Hester Appleton stands , arms folded across the ruffles of her virginal blouse , outside her doorway ; her room is 202 , just down the hall from Room 204 . " Harry mentioned that you came to see him yesteray . " I 'm ashamed to admit I did . Did he say anything else ? We 're waiting for the X-rays to come through or some damn thing . " " Do n't be worried . " The little step forward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long head . " Why not ? " " It does n't do any good . Peter 's very worried , I could tell today in class . " " The poor kid , he did n't get much sleep last night . Our car broke down in Alton . " Hester tucks a strand of her hair back and with an elegant touch of her middle finger pushes her pencil deeper into her bun . Her hair is glossy and not at all gray in the half-light . She is short , bosomy , broad in the beam and , seen from the front , dumpily thick-waisted . But seen sideways her waist is strikinglysmall , tucked in by her doughty upright posture ; she seems from her stance to be always in the act of inhaling . Her blouse wears a gold clasp shaped like an arrow . " He was n't , " she says , after considering once more in her life the face of the man hulking above her in the gloom of the hall , a strange knobbed face whose mystery , in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He 's gon na come down with a cold before I 'm through with him , " Caldwell says . " I know it and I ca n't help it . I 'm gon na get the kid sick and I ca n't stop myself . "  | " He 's not such a fragile boy , George . " She pauses . " In some ways he 's tougher than his father . " Caldwell hears this slightly , enough to bend a bit what he was going to say anyway . " When I was a kid back in Passaic , " he says , " I never remember being laid up with a cold . You wiped your nose on a sleeve and if your throat itched you coughed . The first time in my life I went to bed with anything was with the flu in 1918 ; if that was n't a mess . Brrough ! " Hester feels the pain in the man and she presses her fingers against the gold arrow to hush the disconcerting flutter that has erupted in her chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so many years that in her heart it is as if she had often slept with him . It is as if they had been lovers when younger and for reasons never sufficiently examined they had long ago ceased to be . Caldwell feels this to the extent of being , in her presence , a shade more relaxed than anywhere else . They are both exactlyfifty , a trick of birthdays that in their unthinking deeps does oddly matter . IIe is reluctant to leave her and go down the stairs ; his illness , his son , his debts , the painful burden of land his wife has saddled him with  --  all these problems itch in his brain for expression . Hester wants him ; she wants him to tell her everything . Her frame of manners strains to accommodatethis desire ; as if to empty herself of decades of lonely habit she exhales : sighs . Then says , " Peter 's like Cassie . He has that way of getting what he wants . " " I should have put her on the Burly-cue stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells Miss Appleton in a loud earnest rush . " I should n't have married her , I should have just been her manager . But I did n't have the guts . I was brought up so that as soon as you saw a woman you half-wayp193liked the only thing you could think of to do was ask her to marry you . " This is to say , I should have married a woman like you . You . Though Hester has sought this , now that it arrives it disgustsand alarms her . The man 's shadow before her seems about to dilate with anxiety and to overwhelm her physically . It is too late ; she is insufficiently elastic now . She laughs as if what he has said were meaningless . The sound of her laughter afflicts the diminishing perspective of green lockers with a look of terror . Their air-slits seem aghast at what they see on the opposite wall : framed pictures of vanished baseball and track teams . Hester straightens up , inhales , retucks the pencil into her bun , and asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educa-tion ? " " No thought . My only thought is that it 's going to take more money than I 've got . " " Is he going to attend an art school or a liberal arts college ? " " That 's up to him and his mother . They discuss this sort of thing between them ; it scares the living daylights out of me . As far as I can tell , the kid knows even less than I did at his age what the score is . If I were to kick off now , he and his mother would sit out there in the sticks and try to eat the flowers off the wallpaper . I ca n't afford to die . " " It is a luxury , " Hester says . The Appleton ill-humor has in her taken the form of an occasional unexpected tartness , or irony . She once more examines the mysterious face above her , frowns at the diseaselike murmur in her breast , and moves to turn , dismissing not so much Caldwell as her own secret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her head with its taut round hairdo isp194caught like a crescent moon half in the light from her room . An unimpassioned observer would conclude , from the light , glad , regretful way she smiles up , that he had once been her lover . " Thanks for letting me rave on , " he says . He adds , " I want to confess something . Tomorrow it may be too late . There 've been times in my years here when the kids have got me so down I 've stepped out of the classroom and come here by the drinking fountain just to hear you in there pronouncing French . It 's been better than a drink of water for me , to hear you pronouncing French . It 's never failed to pick me up . " Delicately she asks , " Are you down now ? " " Yep . I 'm down . I 'm in Old Man Winter 's belly . " " Shall I pronounce something ? " " To tell you God 's honest truth , Hester , I 'd appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  apple-cheeked , prune-lipped  --  and she pronounces , word by word , savoring the opening diphthong and closing nasal like two liqueurs , " Dieu est tres fin . " A second of silence hovers . " Say it again , " Caldwell asks . " Dieu - est - tres - fin . It 's the sentence I 've lived by . " " God is very  --  very fine ? " " Oui . Very fine , very elegant , very slender , very exquisite . Dieu est tres fin . " " That 's right . He certainly is . He 's a wonderful old gentleman . I do n't know where the hell we 'd be without Him . " As if by stated consent , both turn away . Caldwell turns back in time to check her . " You were good enough to recite for me , " he says , " I 'd like to recite something for you . I do n't think I 've thought of this for thirtyp195years . It 's a poem we used to have to recite back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shall I try it ? " " Try it . " " I do n't know why the hell I 'm bedevilling you like this . " Like a schoolchild Caldwell stands to attention , makes fists of concentration at his sides , squints to remember , and announces , " Song of the Passaic . ' By John Alleyne MacNab . " He clears his throat . " The great Jehovah wisely planned All things of Earth , divinely grand ; And , in His way , all nature tends To laws divine , to serve His ends . " The rivers run , and none shall know How long their waters yet may flow ; We read the record of the past , While time withholds the future cast . " He thinks , slumps , and smiles . " That 's all the further we go . I thought I 'd remember more . " " Very few men would have remembered as much . It 's not a very happy poem , is it ? " " It is for me , is n't that funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the river . " " Mm . I suppose that is the way things are . Thank you , George , for reciting it . " And now she does turn back into her room . The gold arrow on her blouse seems for an instant to press against her larynx , threatening to smother her . She brushes vaguely at her brow , swallows , and the sensation passes.  |p196Caldwell  heads for the stairs groggy with woes . Peter . His education is a riddle to which however it 's posed the answer is money of which there is not enough . Also his skin and his health . By correcting the exams now Caldwell can give the kid another ten minutes sleep in the morning tomorrow . He hates to pull the kid out of bed . It will be eleven before they get home tonight after the basketball game and this combined with that weird night in the flea-bag last night will ripen him up for another cold . A cold a month like clockwork , they say the skin does n't have anything to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cassie , he had never noticed until they were married , just one spot on her belly , but with the kid it was a plague : arms , legs , chest , even on his face more than he realized , bits of crust in the ears like dried soap and the poor kid did n't know it . Ignorance is bliss . In the Depression when he used to push the kid along on his Kiddy Kar with the forked stick , he had been frightened , he had come to the world 's cliff-edge , and his son 's small face turning around to look back , the freckles solid under his eyes , made the world seem solid . Now his son 's face , dappled , femininein the lips and eyelashes , narrow like a hatchet , anxious and sneering , gnaws at Caldwell 's heart like a piece of unfinished business . If he had had any character he would have put on baggy pants and taken her onto the vaudeville stage . But then vaudevillefolded just like the telephone company . All things fold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that just when they needed it to take them home ? Things never fail to fail . On his deathbed his father 's religion : " eternally forgotten ? " Nos. 1800 I to 18145 : these are the basketball tickets missing.  |p197Through  his closets and his drawers and his papers and the only thing he had found the blue slip of Zimmerman 's report , slip of sky , making his stomach bind like a finger in a slammed door . Biff . Bang . Well , he had n't buried his talent in the ground ; he had lifted the bushel from his light and showed everybody what a burnt-out candle looks like . A thought he had run his mind through in the last minute had pleased him . But what ? He picks his way back through the brown pebbles of his brain to locate this jewel . There . Bliss . Ignorance is bliss . Amen . The steel mullions of the window of the landing halfway down the stairs , with their little black drifts of dirt by now as solid as steel itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming a window , speaks in a loud voice a word of a foreign language . Since , five days ago , Caldwell grasped the possibility that he might die , took it into himself as you might swallow a butterfly , a curiously variable gravity has entered the fabric of things , that now makes all surfaces leadenly thick with heedlesspermanence and the next instant makes them dance with inconsequence , giddy as scarves . Nevertheless , among disintegratingsurfaces he tries to hold his steadfast course . Hummel . Call Cassie . Go to the dentist . This is his program . Be here for the game by 6:15 . Get in the car and take Peter home . He bucks the door of reinforced glass and walks down the empty corridor . See Hummel , call Cassie . At noon Hummel still had n't found a second-hand driveshaft to replace the onep198that snapped in the little odd-shaped lot between the coughdropplant and the railroad tracks ; he was searching by telephonethrough the junk yards and auto body shops of Alton and West Alton . He had estimated the bill would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would somehow make this amount of money matter less , it was just a drop in the bucket as far as she was concerned , just one more drop more or less to pour into that thankless land of hers , eighty acres on his shoulders , land , dead cold land , his blood sunk like rain into that thankless land . And Pop Kramer can stick a whole slice of bread into his mouth at one swoop . Call Cassie . She would be worried ; he foresees their worries intertwining over the phone like two spliced cables . Was Peter all right ? Has Pop Kramer fallen down the stairs yet ? What did the X-rays show ? He does n't know . He has thought off and on all day of calling Doc Appleton but something in him resists giving the old braggart the satisfaction . Ignorance is bliss . Anyway he has to go to the dentist . Thinking of it makes him suck the tender tooth . By searching through his body he can uncover any color and shape of pain he wants : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his truss , the restless poison shredding in his bowels , the remote irritation of a turned toenail gnawing the toe squeezed beside it in the shoe , the little throb above his nose from having used his eyes too hard in the last hour , and the associated but different ache along the top of his skull , like the soreness left by his old leather football helmet after a battering scrimmage down in the Lake Stadium . Cassie , Peter , Pop Kramer , Judy Lengel , Deifendorf : he has them all on his mind . See Hummel , call Cassie , go the dentist , be here by 6:15 . He foresees himself skinned of chores , purified . One thing he loved in his life : inp199splicing cables , the sight of the copper strands , naked and raw and gleaming and fanning when suddenly stripped of the dirty old rubber . The cable 's conductive heart . It used to frighten him to bury something so alive down in the ground . The shadow of the wing tightens so that his intestines wince : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his thoughts his own death keeps coming to the top . His face burns . His legs go watery , his heart and head become enormous with fear . Death that white width for him ? His face is drenched with warmth ; a blindness seizes his body ; he silently begs a face to appear in the air . The long varnished hall , lit by spaced globes of sealed-in light , shimmers in tints of honey , amber , tallow . So familiar , so familiar it is surprising that his footsteps in fifteen years have not worn a path down these boards , yet it seems freshly strange , as strange as on the day when , a young husband and new father still with that soft New Jersey twang and blur in his voice , he had come in the heat of an Olinger summer afternoon for his first interview with Zimmerman . He had liked him . Caldwell had instantly liked Zimmerman , whose heavy uneasy allusive ways reminded him of a cryptic school friend , a seminary roommate , of his father 's who used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who always remembered to bring a little bag of licorice for " young Caldwell . " Licorice for George , and a hair ribbon for Alma . Always . So that in time the little stencilled casket Alma kept on her bureau overflowed with hair ribbons . He had liked Zimmermanand had felt liked in turn . They had shared a joke about Pop Kramer . He can not remember the joke but smiles to remember that one was made , fifteen years ago . Caldwell walks with strengthening strides . Like an unpredictable eddy in the weather , a small breeze arises and cools his cheeks withp200the thought that a dying man would not have it in him to walk so upright . Cattycorner across from the trophy case with its hundred highlights , Zimmerman 's door is shut . As Caldwell strides by , it pops open and Mrs. Herzog steps out at a slant under his nose . She is as startled as he ; her eyes widen behind her cockeyedbutterscotch hornrims and her peacock-feathered hat sits crooked as if with shock . She is , from Caldwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest child has just reached the seventh grade . Already , ripples of protective agitation are spreading upwards from this child through the faculty . She got herself elected to the school board to guarantee personally her children'seducation . From his professional heart , Caldwell despisesthese meddling mothers ; they have n't a clue as to what education is : a jungle , an unholy mess . Arrogantly her mouth in its blurred purplish lipstick refuses to frame a smile of confessedsurprise , instead remaining ajar in frank amazement , like a stuck letter slot . Caldwell breaks the silence . An urchin 's impudence , revived from deep in his childhood by the forgotten sensation of nearly having his nose socked , dimples his face as he tells her , Mrs. Herzog of the school board , " Boy , the way you came out of that door reminded me of a cuckoo clock ! " Her air of interrupted dignity , ridiculous in one not yet out of her thirties and leaning her weight on a doorknob , freezes the harder at this greeting . ' With glassied eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not until he has bucked open the wire-reinforced double doors and started down the steps underthe yellow wall where since yesterday the word FUCK has been scrubbed away , does the fist sink into his stomach . His goose , cooked . What in hell had the pushy bitch been doing inp201there ? He had felt Zimmerman 's presence behind her in his office , a dark cloud ; he could feel Zimmerman 's atmosphere through a keyhole . She had shoved open the door like a woman making a point at her back and not dreaming her front was exposed . Caldwell in his present state can not afford another enemy . Tickets 18001 to 18145 , Zimmerman 's report saying in black and blue that he hit the kid in class , and now this : bumping into Mim Herzog with her lipstick smeared . A bubble expandsin his throat and , stepping into the open , he takes in fresh air with a gasp as sharp as a sob . Blurred crimped clouds have been lowered tangent to the town 's slate roofs . The roofs seem greasily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a hastening fate . Lifting his head and sniffing , Caldwell experiences a vivid urge to walk on faster , to canter right past Hummel 's , to romp neighing through the front door and out the back door of any house in Olinger that stood in his way , to gallop up the brushy brown winter-burned flank of Shale Hill and on , on , over hills that grow smoother and bluer with distance , on and on on a southeastcourse cutting diagonally across highways and rivers frozen solid as highways until at last he drops , his head in death extended toward Baltimore . The herd has deserted Minor 's . Only three persons inhabit the luncheonette : Minor himself , Johnny Dedman , and that atrocious ego Peter Caldwell , the science teacher 's son . All but the shiftless and homeless are at their own tables at this hour . Five-forty . Next door , the post office has closed . Mrs. Passify , moving tenderly on worn legs , lowers the grates on the windowsand eases shut the drawers colorful with stamps and insertsthe counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back room seems a battlefield hospital where gray mail sacks lie unconscious , steeped in an anesthesia of shadows , prone , misshapen , and disembowelled . She sighs and goes to the window . To a passerby on the pavement her great round face would seem the face of a grotesquely swollen child straining to peek out of a tiny port-hole , the goldleaf 0 at the zenith of the arc of letters spelling POST OFFICE . Beside her , Minor methodically twists his coarse white cloth into the steaming throat of each Coca-Cola glass before he sets it down on the towel he has spread beside his sink . Each glass continues to give off a few wisps of mist as the cool air licks it . Through his window , which is beginning to fog , the pike is ripe with cars hurrying home  --  a laden branch whose fruit glows . The luncheonette behind him is all but empty , like a stage . It has been supporting a debate . Within , Minor is a cauldron of rage ; his hairy nostrils seem seething vents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you 're old-fashioned . There 's nothing wrong with Communism . In twenty years we 'll have it in this country and you 'll be happy as a clam . " Minor turns from the window , dome flashing , brain raging . " If old FDR had lived we 'd have it , " he says , and laughs angrily , so that his nostrils spread under the burst of pressure . " But he went and killed himself , or else he died of syphilis . God 's judgement : mark my words . " " Minor , you do n't believe that . You could n't be sane and believethat . " " I believe it , " Minor says . " He was rotten in the head when he went to Yalta or we would n't be in the fix we are now . " " What fix ? What fix , Minor ? This country is sitting on top of the world . We got the big bomb and we got the big bomb-ers. "  | " Arrrhh . " Minor turns away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He turns back and says , " The Ruskies 'll be in France and Italy before the year 's over . " " So what ? So what , Minor ? Communism has to come , one way or another ; it 's the only way to beat poverty . " Johnny Dedman in a separate booth is smoking his eighth Camel of the hour and is trying to blow one smoke ring through another . Now he cries , without warning , the word " War ! " and with his finger rat-tat-tats the big brown button knotted onto the end of the light cord above his head . Minor comes back in his narrow runway behind the counter the better to address the boys in their dim booths . " We should 've kept marching when we hit the Elbe and taken Moscow when we had the chance . They were rotten and ready for us , the Russian soldier is the most cowardly in the world . The peasants would have risen up to greet us . That 's what old Churchill wanted us to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but clever , clever . He did n't love Old Joe . Nobody in the world loved Old Joe but King Franklin . " Peter says , " Minor , you really are insane . What about Leningrad ? They were n't cowardly then . " , " They did n't win it . They did not win it . Our equipment won it . Our tanks . Our guns . Sent courtesy free parcel post by your good friend FDR ; he robbed the American people to save the Russians who then turn right around and are ready to march this minute over the Alps into Italy . " " He was trying to beat Hitler , Minor . Do n't you remember ? Adolf H-I-T-L-E-R . " " I love Hitler , " Johnny Dedman announces . " He 's alive in Argentina . "  | " Minor loved him too , " Peter says , reedy-voiced with fury and hot in all his limbs . " Did n't you , Minor ? Did n't you think Hitler was a nice man ? " " I never did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , I 'd rather have Hitler alive than old Joe Stalin . There is the Devil Incarnate . You mark my words . " " Minor , what do you have against Communism ? They would n't make you go to work . You 're too old . You 're too sick . " " Bal . Pam , " Johnny Dedman cries . " We should 've dropped an atom bomb on Moscow , Berlin , Paris , France , Italy , Mexico City , and Africa . Ka-Pow . I love that mushroom-shaped cloud . " " Minor , " Peter says . " Minor . Why do you exploit us poor teenagers so ruthlessly ? Why are you so brutal ? You 've got the board of the pinball machine tilted so steeply nobody exceptDedman can get any free games out of it and he 's a genius . " " I am a genius , " Dedman says . " They do n't even believe in a Divine Creator , " Minor states . " Well , my God , who does ? " Peter exclaims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious is he to pin this man who with his black Republican stupidity and stubborn animal vigor embodies everything in the world that is killing Peter 's father ; he has to keep Minor from turning his back , he has to hold , as it were , the world open . " You do n't . I do n't . Nobody does . Really . " Yet in this boast , now that it is issued , Peter perceives an abysmal betrayal of his father . In his mind he sees his father slip into a pit stunned . He waits , so hungrily his mouth feels parched , for Minor 's rejoinder , whatever it might be , so that in the twists and detours of argument he can find ap205way to retract . So much of Peter 's energy is spent in wishing he could take back things he has said . " I believe you , " Minor says simply , turning . The way out is sealed . " In two years , " Johnny Dedman estimates aloud , " there 'll be a war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first sergeant . Peter will be peeling potatoes in the hack of the kitchen , behind the garbagepails . " He softly blows one swelling smoke ring and then , the miracle , makes his mouth as tiny and tight as a keyhole and puffs out a smaller ring which , spinning quickly , passes through the larger . At the moment of interpenetration both blur , and a loose cloud of smoke lengthens like an arm reaching for the light-cord . Dedman sighs , a bored creator . " Rotten in the head at Yalta , " Minor calls from far up the counter , " and Truman at Potsdam as dumb as they come . That man was so dumb his haberdashery store went bankrupt and the next minute he 's running the United States of America . " The door bucks open , and the darkness on the porch materializesinto a hard figure in a bullet cap . " Peter here ? " it asks . " Mr. Caldwell , " Minor says in that basso he reserves for greeting adults . " Yes he is . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He just does that to kid you . You know that . There is n't a man in town he thinks more of than Minor Kretz . You 're a father to that boy , and do n't think his mother and I do n't appreciate it . " " Hey Daddy , " Peter calls , embarrassed for him . Caldwell comes back toward the booths , blinking ; he seems unable to find his son . He stops at Dedman 's booth . " Who 's this ? Oh . Dedman . Have n't they got you graduated yet ? "  | " Hi there George , " Dedman says . Caldwell does not expect much from his students but he does expect the dignity of formal address . Of course they sense this . Cruelty is clever where goodness is imbecile . " I hear your swimming team lost again . What does that make it ? Eighty in a row ? " " They tried , " Caldwell tells him . " If you do n't have the cards , you ca n't manufacture ' em . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dedman says , his cheeks glowing ripely , his long lashes curled . " Look at my cards , George . " He reaches into the pocket of his forest-green shirt for the pornographic deck . " Put them away , " Minor calls from far up in his runway . Electric light bleaches his skull and strikes cool sparks from the dried Coke glasses . Caldwell does not seem to hear . He walks on to the booth where his son sits smoking a Kool . Giving no sign of seeing the cigarette , he slides in opposite Peter and says , " Jesus , a funny thing happened to me just now . " " What ? How is the car ? " " The car , believe it or not , is fixed . I do n't know how Hummeldoes it ; he 's what you call a master of his trade . He 's treated me swell all my life . " A new thought pricks him and he turns his head . " Dedman ? You still here ? " Dedman has been holding his cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , eyes bright . " Yeah ? " " Why do n't you quit school and get a job with Hummel ? As I remember , you 're a natural mechanic . " The boy shrugs uncomfortably under this unexpected thrust of concern . He says , " I 'm waiting for the war . " " You 'll wait until Doomsday , kid , " the teacher calls to him . " Do n't bury your talent in the ground . Let your light shine . Ifp207I had your mechanical talent , this poor kid here would be eatingcaviar . " " I got a police record . " " So did Bing Crosby . So did St. Paul . They did n't let that stop ' em . Do n't use it as a crutch . You talk to Al Hummel . I never had a better friend in this town , and I was in worse shape than you are . You 're just eighteen ; I was thirty-five . " Agitated , Peter takes a puff made hopelessly awkward by his father 's presence and stubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father from this conversation , which he knows Dedman in retelling will make into a joke . " Daddy , what was the funny thing ? " He is overswept , as the smoke soaks his lungs with its mild poison , by a wave of distaste for all this mediocre , fruitless , cloying involvement . Somewhere there is a city where he will be free . His father speaks so only he can hear . " I was walking through the hall ten minutes ago and Zimmerman 's door bumps open and who the hell pops out but Mrs. Herzog . " " Well what 's so funny about that ? She 's on the school board . " " I do n't know if I should tell you this , but I guess you 're old enough now ; she looked loved up . " Peter giggles in surprise . " Loved up ? " He laughs again and regrets having stubbed out his cigarette , which now seems priggish . " There 's a look women get . In their faces . She had it , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wearing all her clothes ? " " Sure , but her hat looked crooked . And her lipstick had been smeared . " " Uh-oh. "  | " Uh-oh is right . It 's something I was n't meant to see . " " Well it 's not your fault , you were just walking down the hall . " " That does n't matter , it was n't my fault ; if that was the rule nothing is ever anybody 's fault . The fact is , kid , I walked right into a nest of trouble ; Zimmerman 's been playing catand-mousewith me for fifteen years and this is the end of the line . " " Oh , Daddy . Your imagination is so fertile . She was probably in there consulting about something , you know Zimmermanmakes appointments for all hours . " " You did n't see the look in her eyes when she saw me . " " Well what did you do ? " " I just give her the old sweet smile and keep going . But the cat is out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now let 's be rational . Would she be capable of anything with Zimmerman ? She 's a middle-aged woman , is n't she ? " Peter wonders why his father smiles . Caldwell says , " She has a kind of name around town . She 's a good ten years younger than Herzog ; she did n't marry him until he 'd made his pot . " " But Daddy , she has a child in the seventh grade . " Peter is exasperated at his father 's inability to see the obvious , that women who run for the school board are beyond sex , that sex is for adolescents . He does not know how to put this to his father delicately . Indeed , the juxtaposition of his father and this subject is so stressful that his tongue feels locked in the bind . His father kneads his brown-spotted hands together so hard that the knuckles turn yellow . He moans , " I could feel Zim/merman sitting in there like a big heavy raincloud ; I can feel him on my chest right now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're ridiculous . Why do you make such a mountain out of a molehill ? Zimmerman does n't even exist in the way you see him . He 's just a slippery old fatheadwho likes to pat the girls . " His father looks up , cheeks slack , startled . " I wish I had your self-confidence , Peter , " he says . " If I had your selfconfidenceI would 've taken your mother onto the Burly-cue stage and you never would have been born . " This is as close to a rebuke of his son as he ever came . The boy 's cheeks burn . Caldwell says , " I better call her , " and heaves himself up out of the booth . " I ca n't get it out of my head that Pop Kramer is going to fall down those stairs . If I live I 'm determined to put up a bannister . " Peter follows him to the front of the luncheonette . " Minor , " Caldwell asks , " would it break your heart if ' I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the bill , Caldwell asks him , " When do you think the Russians will reach Olinger ? They 're probably getting on the trolley up at Ely now . " " Like son , like father , huh Minor ? " Johnny Dedman calls from his booth . " Is there any special way you want this ? " Minor asks , displeased . " A five , four ones , three quarters , two dimes , and a nickel . " Caldwell goes on , " I hope they do come . It would be the best thing that happened to this town since the Indians left . They 'd line us up against the wall of the post office and put us out of our misery , old bucks like you and me . " Minor does n't want to hear it . He snorts so angrily that Caldwell asks in a high pained voice , his searching voice , " Wellp210what do you think the answer is ? We 're all too dumb to die by ourselves . " As usual , he receives no answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five . " What 's this for ? " " To eat on . Man is a mammal that must eat . We ca n't ask Minor to feed you for free , though he 's gentleman enough to do it , I know he is . " " But where did you get it ? " " It 's O. K. " By this Peter understands that his father has again borrowedfrom the school athletic funds that are placed in his trust . Peter understands nothing of his father 's financial involvementsexcept that they are confused and dangerous . Once as a child , four years ago , he had a dream in which his father was called to account . Face ashen , his father , clad in only a cardboard grocery box beneath which his naked legs showed spindly and yellowish , staggered down the steps of the town hall while a crowd of Olingerites cursed and laughed and threw pulpy dark objects that struck the box with a deadenedthump . In that way we have in dreams , where we are both author and character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall there had been a trial . His father had been found guilty , stripped of everything he owned , flogged , and sent forth into the world lower than the hoboes . From his pallor plainly the disgrace would kill him . In his dream Peter shouted , " No ! You do n't understand ! Wait ! " The words came out in a child 's voice . He tried to explain aloud to the angry townspeople how innocent his father was , how overworked , worried , conscientious , and anxious ; but the legs of the crowd shoved and smothered him and he could not make hisp211voice heard . He woke up with nothing explained . So now , in the luncheonette , it feels to him as if he is accepting a piece of his father 's flayed skin and inserting it into his wallet to be spent on hamburgers , lemon Pepsis , the pinball machine , and Reese 's Peanut Butter Cups whose chocolate is terrible for his psoriasis . The pay phone is attached to the wall behind the comic book rack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Firetown . " Cassie ? We 're in the luncheonette . . . It 's fixed . It was the driveshaft . . . He thinks about twenty bucks , he had n't figured out the labor yet . Tell Pop Al asked about him . Pop has n't fallen down the stairs yet , has he ? . . . You know I did n't mean that , I hope he does n't too . . . No , no I have n't , I have n't had a second , I got ta be at the dentist in five minutes . . . To tell the truth , Cassie , I 'm scared to hear what he has to say . . . I know that . . . I know that . . . I 'd guess around eleven . Have you run out of bread ? I bought you an Italian sandwich last night and it 's still sitting ' in the car .. . Huh ? He looks O. K. , I just gave him five bucks so he can eat . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to Peter . " Your mother wants to talk to you . " Peter resents that she should invade this way the luncheonettethat was the center of his life apart from her . Her voice sounds tiny and stern , as if , in pinching her into this metal box , the telephone company has offended her feelings . The magneticpull she exerts over him is transmitted through the wires , so that he too feels reduced in size . " Hi , " he says . " How does he look to you , Peter ? " " Who ? "  | " Who ? Why Daddy . Who else ? " " Kind of tired and excited , I ca n't tell . You know what a puzzle he is . " " Are you as worried as I am ? " " I guess so , sure . " " Why has n't he called Doc Appleton back ? " " Maybe he does n't think the X-rays are developed yet . " Peterlooks toward his father as if to be confirmed . The man is engaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't mean to be sarcastic a minute ago about the Communists , I hate ' em as much as you do , Minor . . . " The telephone overhears and asks , " Who 's he talking to ? " " Minor Kretz . " " He 's just fascinated by that kind of man , is n't he ? " the miniature female voice bitterly remarks in Peter 's ear . " They 're talking about the Russians . " A kind of cough ticks in the receiver and Peter knows his mother has started crying . His stomach sinks . He casts about for something to say , and his eye like a fly lights on one of the trick turds of painted plaster among the novelties . " How 's the dog ? " he asks . His mother 's breathing struggles for self-control . In the intervalsof her crying jags her voice becomes oddly composed and stony . " She was in the house all this morning and I finally let her run after lunch . When she came back she had been after another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come out of his room . With no bread in the house , his temper is running short . " " Do you think Lady killed the skunk ? " " I think so . She was laughing . "  | " Daddy says he 's going to the dentist . " " Yes . Now that it 's too late . " Another wave of silent tears spreads into Peter 's ear ; his brain is flooded with the image of how his mother 's eyes would be , red-rimmed and ponderous with water . A ' faint grainy smell , of grass or corn , affects his nose . " I do n't think it 's necessarily too late , " he says . It is pompousand insincere but he is compelled to say something . All the telephone numbers teenagers have pencilled on the wall above the phone begin to swap and swirl under his eyes . His mother sighs . " Yes , I suppose . Peter . " " Yeah ? " " Take care of your father now . " " I 'll try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? But he loves you so . " " O. K. , I 'll try . Do you want him back ? " " No . " She pauses , and then , with that theatrical talent for holding the stage that perhaps is the germ of sense in his father'sfantasy about putting her in vaudeville , she repeats with tremulous import , " No . " " O. K. , we 'll see you around eleven then . " His mother 's mind , shorn of her comforting body , is keenly exhausting to Peter . She senses this , and sounds even more hurt , more remote , more miniature and stony . " The weatherman wants snow . " " Yeah , the air kind of feels like it . " " All right . All right , Peter . Hang up on your poor old mother . You 're a good boy . Do n't worry about anything . " " O. K. , do n't you either . You 're a good woman . " What a thing to say to your own mother ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his scabs itch , the peculiarity of talking to her over the phone , where she becomes , incestuously , a simply femalevoice with whom he has shared secrets . " Did she sound upset ? " his father asks him . " A little . I think Pop 's throwing an atmosphere . " " That man can throw ' em , too . " Caldwell turns and explains to Minor . " This is my father-in-law . He 's eighty-four and he can throw an atmosphere that knocks you out of your shoes . He can throw an atmosphere right through a keyhole in a door . That man has more power in his little finger than you and I have from our bellies up . " " Arrh , " Minor grunts softly , setting on the counter a sudstoppedglass of milk . Caldwell drains it in two gulps , puts it down , winces , turns a shade paler , and bites back a belch . " Boy , " he said , " that milk took a wrong turn down there somewhere . " He still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey style . He runs his tongue back and forth across his front teeth as if to clean them . " Now I 'm off to Dr. Yankem . " Peter asks , " Shall I go with you ? " The dentist 's real name is Kenneth Schreuer and his office is two blocks down the pike , beyond the high school on the other side , opposite the tennis courts . Schreuer always has a soap opera going on the radio , from nine in the morning to six at night . On Wednesdaysand Sundays from spring to fall he walks across the trolley tracks in white ducks and becomes one of the county 's better tennis players . He is a better tennis player than he is a dentist . His mother works in the school cafeteria . " No , hell , " Caldwell says . " What can you do , Peter ? The damage is done . Do n't worry about this old heap of junk . Stay here where it 's warm and you have friends . " So Peter 's first piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his father is to watch the suffering man , his coat unbuttoned and too short and his knit bullet cap pulled down over his ears , head out the dark door alone into one more doom . Johnny Dedman calls from his booth , sincerely , " Hey Peter . With you and your father standing up there against the light for a second I could n't tell which was which . " " He 's taller , " Peter says curtly . Dedman as a sincere good boy does n't interest him . He feels in himself with the coming of night great sweet stores of wickedness ripen . He turns , pivotingon the weight of the five dollars at his hip , and tells Minor triumphantly , " Two hamburgers . No ketchup . And a glass of your watered milk and five nickels for your rigged pinball machine . " He goes back to his booth and relights the Kool he had stubbed out half-smoked . Polar ice thrills his proud throat ; he preens on the empty stage of Minor 's place positive that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily idle time ahead of him , a child 's dream of freedom , so exalts his heart it beats twice as fast and threatens to burst , tinting the dim air rose . Forgive me . " Darling . Wait ? " " Mm ? " " Is n't there some better place than your office ? " " No . Not in winter . " " But we 've been seen . " " You 've been seen . " " But he knew . I could tell by his face that he knew . He looked as frightened as I felt . " " Caldwell knows and yet he does n't know . " " But do you trust him ? "  | " The matter of trust has never come up between us . " " But now ? " " I trust him . " " I do n't think you should . Could n't we fire him ? " He laughs richly , disconcerting her . She is customarily slow to see her own humor . He says , " You overestimate my omnipotence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has friends . He has tenure . " " But he really is incompetent , is n't he ? " It disagrees with him , makes an uncongenial texture , when she turns argumentative and inquisitive in his embrace . The stupidity of women has a wonderfully fresh power to disappointhim . " Is he ? Competence is not so easy to define . He stays in the room with them , which is the most important thing . Furthermore , he 's faithful to me . He 's faithful . " " Why are you sticking up for him ? He could destroy us both now . " He laughs again . " Come , come , my little bird . Human beingsare harder to destroy than that . " Though her turns of anxiety are sometimes disagreeable , her physical presence profoundlyrelaxes him , and in his condition of innermost rest words seem to slip from him without trouble of thought , as liquid slips from high to low , as gas spins into the void . She becomes vehement and angular in his arms . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smirky childish look . " " His face makes you feel guilty . " This surprising remark turns her inquisitiveness tender . " Should we feel guilty ? " The question is actually shy . " Absolutely . Afterwards . " This makes her smile , and her smiling makes her mouth soft ,  |p217and  in kissing her he feels he is coming at last to a small sip after an interminable thirst . That the kissing does not quench the thirst , but quickens it , so that each kiss demands a more intense successor and involves , him thereby in a vortex of mounting and widening appetite  --  that such is the case does not seem to him a cruel but , rather , a typically generous and compelling providence of Nature . A tree of pain takes root in his jaw . Wait , wait ! Kenny should have waited a few minutes more on the Novocain . But this is the end of the day , the boy is tired and hurried . Kenny had been one of Caldwell 's first students , back in the Thirties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knee against the arm of the chair to win more leverage for the pliers which are grinding around the tooth and crushing it like chalk even as they try to twist it free . Caldwell 's fear is that the tooth will crumble between the pliers and remain in his head as a stripped and scraped nerve . Truly , the pain is unprecedented : an entire tree rich with bloom , each bloom showering into the livid blue air a coruscation of lucid lime-green sparks . He opens his eyes in disbelief that this could go on and on , and his horizon is filled with the dim pink of the dentist 's determined mouth , odorous of cloves , the lips pressed together a bit lopsidedly : a weak mouth . The kid had tried to become an M. D. but had n't had the I. Q. so he had settled on being a butcher . Caldwell recognizes the pain branching in his head as a consequence of some failing in his own teaching , a failure somewhere to inculcatein this struggling soul consideration and patience ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its branches and blooms compound into one silver plume , cone , column of pain , a column whose height towers heavenward from a basep218in which Caldwell 's skull is embedded . It is pure shrill silver with not a breath , not a jot , speck , fleck of alloy in it . " There . " Kenneth Schreuer exhales with relief . His hands are trembling , his back is damp . He displays to Caldwell their prize in his pliers . As if emerging swollen from a dream , Caldwellwith difficulty focuses . It is a little dull crumb of ivory , dappled brown and black , mounted on soft pink bow legs . It seems preposterously trivial to have resisted removal so furiously . " Spit , " the dentist says . Obediently Caldwell bends his face to the yellow basin , and a gush of blood joins the filmy swirl of clear water spinning there . The blood seems orangish and muddied with spittle . The sense of his head being pure silver yields to an airy giddiness . Fright and pressure flee through the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all created things , for the clean gleaming rounded lip of the circular enamel basin , for the bright little bent pipe shooting water into it , for the little comet-tail-shaped smear of rust this miniature Charybdis had worn down the section of the vortex where its momentum expires ; grateful for the delicate dental smells , for the sounds of Kenny restoring his tools to the sterilizer bath , for the radio on the shelf filtering a shudder of organ music through its static . The announcer intones , " I - Love - a - Mystery ! " and the organ swirls forward again , ecstatic . " It 's a shame , " Kenny says , " the caps of your teeth are n't as strong as the roots . " " That 's the story of my life , " Caldwell says . " Big feet , weak head . " His tongue in enunciating encounters a bubbly softness . He spits again . Strange to say , he finds the sight of his blood cheering.  |p219With  a steel tool Kenny picks at the pulled tooth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the floor . Kenny gouges out a chip of black filling and puts the pick to his nostrils and sniffs . " Mm , " he says , " yes . Hopeless . This must have been giving you a good deal of pain . " " Only when I noticed it . " On the radio , the announcer explains , " We last left Doc and Reggie trapped in the great subterranean metropolis of monkeyssound of monkeys chattering , yipping , cooing sadly and now Doc turns to fade Reggie and says ... " Doc : " We got ta get out of here ! The Princess is waiting ! " Cheepy cheep . Birrup , birrr000 . Kenny gives Caldwell two tablets of Anacin in a cellophane jacket . " There may be some discomfort , " he says , " when the Novocain wears off . " It never wore on , Caldwell thinks . Preparing to leave , he spits for the last time into the basin . Already the flow of his blood is slowing and thinning and yellowing . He timidly touches his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A vague numb sense of loss afflicts him . Another day , another molar . ( He should be writing Valentines . ) Here comes Heller down the annex hall ! Twiddle , piddle ; piddle , pat ! ! How the man does love his own broad broom ! ! ! Past the girls ' lavatory he painstakingly goes , strewing red wax and sweeping up the same in the shimmer of varnish , past Room 113 where Art the visible mirror of God 's invisible glory is held up by Miss Schrack , past iii where typewriters lurk under tattered black shrouds through which here and there a space bar thrusts an eerie silver hand , past 109 with itsp220great brittle ochre map of the old trade routes whereby spice , amber , fur , and slaves were transported across Carolingian Europe , past 107 smelling of sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide , 105 , 103 , doors all shut , glass frosted , facing green lockers that dwindle to an insane perspective of zero , Heller goes , gathering under the methodical push of his broom buttons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cellophane , hair , thread , tangerine seeds , comb teeth , Peter Caldwell 's psoriasis scratchings , and all the undignifiable flecks and flakes and bits and motes and whatnot dust that go to make up a universe : he harvests these . He hums inaudibly an old tune to himself . He is happy . The school is his . Clocks all over the wooden acres tick in unison 6:1o . In its subterranean mansion one of the vast boilers makes an irrevocable decision and swallows in a single draft a quarter-ton of hard pea coal : Pennsylvania anthracite , old Lepidodendra , pure compressed time . The furnace heart burns with a white heat that must be viewed through a mica peephole . Heller hugs to his rusty heart the underside of this high school . It was the promotion of his life when he was lifted from the custodial staff of the elementary building , where the little children , ticklish-tummied as lambs , daily made a puddle or two of rancid vomit to wipe up and perfume with sal ammoniac . Here there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then a malicious excremental mess in one of the male lavatories . The memory of people and people 's clothes touches the halls with a dry perfume . The drinking fountains wait to spurt . The radiators purr . The side door slams ; a member of the JV basketball team has entered with his gym bag and gone down to the locker room . At the front entrance , Mr. Caldwellp221and Mr. Phillips meet on the steps and enact , one tall and one short , an Alphonse and Gaston routine as to who is to go in the door first . Heller stoops and sweeps into his broad pan his gray mountain of dust and fluff , enlivened by a few paper scraps . He transfers this dirt to the great cardboard can waitingat this corner . Then , setting himself behind the broom , he pushes off and disappears behind the corner , piddle , pat . There he goes ! ! ! ! " George , I hear you have n't been feeling too well , " Phillips says to the other teacher . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case he is startled to observe a trickle of blood leaking from the corner of Caldwell 's mouth . There is usually some imperfection or oversight of grooming about the other man that secretly distresses him . " Sometimes up , sometimes down , " Caldwell says . " Phil , a strip of missing tickets has been preying on my mind . Numbers1800i to 18145 . " Phillips thinks and as he thinks takes  --  his habit  --  a jerky sidestep , as if smoothing the infield . " Well , it 's just paper , " he says . " So 's money , " Caldwell says . He looks so sick in saying it that Phillips asks , " Have you been taking anything ? " Caldwell makes his pinched stoic mouth . " I 'll be O. K. , Phil . I went to the doctor yesterday and an X-ray 's been taken . " Phillips sidesteps the other way . " Show anything ? " he asks , looking at his shoes , as if to check the laces . As if to drown out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellows , " I have n't found out yet . I 've been on the go steadily . "  | " George . May I speak as a friend ? " " Go ahead , I 've never heard you speak any other way . " " There 's one thing you have n't learned , and that 's how to take care of yourself . You know now , we 're not as young as we were before the war ; we must n't act like young men . " " Phil , I do n't know any other way to act . I 'll have to act childish until they put the half-dollars over my eyes . " Phillips ' laugh is a shade nervous . He had been a year on the faculty when Caldwell joined it , and though they have been through much together Phillips has never quite shaken his sense of being the other man 's senior and guide . At the same time he can not rid himself of an obscure expectation that Caldwellout of his more chaotic and mischievous resources would produce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be said . He asks , " Did you hear about Ache ? "  --  pronounced Ockey . A bright and respectful and athletic and handsome student from the late Thirties , the kind that does a teacher 's heart good , a kind once plentiful in Olinger but in the universaldecay of virtue growing rare . " Killed , " Caldwell says . " But I do n't understand how . " " Over Nevada , " Phillips tells him , shifting his armload of papers and books to the other arm . " He was a flight instructor , and his student made a mistake . Both killed . " " Is n't that funny ? To go all through the war without a scratch and then get nailed in peacetime . " Phillips ' eyes have a morbid trick  --  little men are more emotional  --  ofgoing red in the middle of a conversation if the subjectwere even remotely melancholy . " I hate it when they die young , " he blurts . He loves the well-coordinated among his students like sons , his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend 's neat centrally parted cap of hair suddenly seems the lid of a casket in which might be locked the nugget of information he so needs . He asks earnestly , " Do you think it makes a difference ? Are they less ready ? Do you feel ready ? " Phillips tries to direct his mind to the question but it is like trying to press the like poles of two magnets together . They push away . " I do n't know , " he admits . " They say there 's a time for everything , " he adds . " Not for me , " Caldwell says . " I 'm not ready and it scares the hell out of me . What 's the answer ? " There is silence between the two men while Heller passes with his broom . The janitor nods and smiles and passes them by this time . Again , Phillips can not bring his mind to touch the issue squarely ; it keeps shying gratefully into side issues . He stares intently at the center of Caldwell 's chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you spoken to Zimmerman ? " he asks . " Perhaps a sabbatical is the answer . " " I ca n't afford a sabbatical . What would the kid do ? He could n't even get to high school . He 'd have to go to school in the sticks with a lot of clodhoppers on the bus . " " He 'd survive , George . " " I doubt it like hell . He needs me to keep him going , the poor kid does n't have a clue yet . I ca n't fade out before he has the clue . You 're lucky , your kid has the clue . " This is a sad piece of flattery that makes Phillips shake his head . The rims of his eyes deepen in tint . Ronnie Phillips , now a freshman at Penn State , is brilliant in electronics . But even while in the high school he openly ridiculed his father'sp224love of baseball . He bitterly felt that too many of the precious hours of his childhood had been wasted playing cat and **26;4254;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronnie seems to know what he wants . " " More power to him , " Caldwell shouts . " My poor kid , what he wants is the whole world in a candy box . " " I thought he wanted to paint . " " Ooh . " Caldwell grunts ; the poison has wormed an inch deeper into his bowels . Sons are a heavy subject for these two . Caldwell changes the subject . " Coming out of my room todayI had a kind of revelation ; it 's taken me fifteen years of teaching to see it . " Phillips asks quickly " What ? " , eager to know , for all the times he has been fooled . " Ignorance is bliss , " Caldwell states . Seeing no light of welcomedawn on his friend 's hopefully wrinkled face , he repeats it louder , so it echoes down the empty diminishing hall . " Ignoranceis bliss . That 's the lesson I 've gotten out of life . " " God help us , you may be right , " Phillips fussily exclaims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But for a minute longer the two teachers stand together in the hall , finding a measure of repose in familiar company , and some ambiguous warmth in the sense of having failed each other without blamingeach other . So two steeds in the same pen huddle through a storm . If men were horses , Caldwell would have been the drudging dappled type , somewhat anonymous but not necessarilyill-bred , known as a " big gray , " and Phillips a gallant little Morgan , chestnut , with a prissy tail and nicely polished hooves  --  practically a pony . Caldwell has a last thought . " My old man went and died be/fore he was my age , " he says , " and I did n't want to doublecrossmy own kid like that . " With a yank that makes the legs chatter and screech , he pulls a small oak table , much gnawed , from its place against the wall ; from off this table basketball tickets are to be sold . A panicked shout wells in the auditorium and lifts dust in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still stream through the entrance and down the glaring hall . Adolescent boys as hideous and various as gargoyles , the lobes of their ears purple with the cold , press , eyes popping , mouths flapping , under the glowing overhead globes . Girls , rosy-cheeked , glad , motley and mostly ill-made , like vases turned by a preoccupied potter , are embedded , plaid-swaddled , in the hot push . Menacing , odorous , blind , the throng gives off a muted shuffling thunder , a flickeringly articulatetinkle : the voices of the young . " So I said , That 's your tough luck , buddy boy . ' " " J ' I hear you knockin ' but you ca n't come in J ' " I thought it was real doggy . " " The bitch rolled over and , no shit , said , Again . ' " " Use common sense . How can one infinity be larger than another ? " " Who says he says , that 's what I 'd like to know . " " You can tell with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of her neck that gets red . " " He 's his own best lover if you ask me . " " Box lunch  --  sluurrp ! " " I 'll put it this way to you : infinity equals infinity . Right ? " " So then I heard that she said , so I said to him , I do n't know what 's going on , I guess . ' "  | " If he ca n't stop it , he should n't have started it . " " His mouth just dropped . Literally dropped . " " When did it all happen , ages ago ? " " But if you take only every odd number that exists and add them up , you still get infinity , do n't you ? Do you follow that much ? " " Was this at the one in Pottsville ? " " f I 'm in my nightie and it 's awful thi-in f " " Tough luck ? ' he said , and I said , Yes . Yours . ' " " Finally , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sees him . She is alone , he has a girl , she is alone , his girl has come to him alone : through the circuit of such simple thoughts his heart spins . He calls to her , " I saved you a seat . " He sits in the middle of the row ; the seat he has saved for her is piled high with other students ' coats and scarves . Herolike , she swims the strait between them , pursing her complacent mouth impatiently , making others rise from their seats to let her by , laughing as she nearly tumbles on an obtruded foot . While the coats are removed from her seat , Peter and Penny are pressed together , he having half-risen . Their knees interlock awkwardly ; he playfully blows and the hair above her ear lifts . She seems , the skin of her face and throat a luminous stillness in the midst of hubbub and thumping , delicious to him , edible , succulent . Her smallness makes this succulence . She is small enough for him to lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last coat is removedand they settle side by side in the happy heat and chaos . The players , exulting in all the space reserved for them , gallopback and forth on their plain of varnished boards . The ballp227arches high but not so high as the caged bulbs burning on the auditorium ceiling . A whistle blows . The clock stops . The cheerleaders rush out , the maroon 0 's on their yellow sweaters bobbling , and form a locomotive . " 0 , " they call , seven brazen sirens , their linked forearms forming a single piston . " Ohh , " moans back Echo , stricken .  --  L  --  " Hell , " is the answer , deliberately aitched , a school tradition . " Aaiii , " a cry from the depths . Peter 's scalp goes cold and under the cover of a certain actual ecstasy he grips his girl 's arm . " Hi , " she says , pleased , her skin still chilly from the out-of-doors . " V. , , The response comes faster , " Enn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vortex between the crowd and the cheerleaders , until at its climax it seems they are all sucked down into another kingdom , " Olinger ! Olinger ! OLINGER ! " The girls scamper back , play resumes , and the auditorium , big as it is , subsides into a living-room where everybody knows everybody else . Peter and Penny chat . " I 'm so glad you came , " he says . " It surprises me , how glad I am . " " Why thank you , " Penny says dryly . " How 's your father ? " " Frantic . We did n't even get home last night . The car broke down . " " Poor Peter . " " No , I kind of enjoyed it . " " Do you shave ? "  | " No . Should I ? Am I ready ? " " No ; but it looks like a bit of dried shaving cream in your ear . " " You know what that is ? " " What ? Is it something ? " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret . " " Everybody has secrets . " " But mine is very special . " " What is it ? " " I ca n't tell you . I 'll have to show you . " " Peter , are n't you funny ? " " Would you rather I did n't ? Are you frightened ? " " No . You do n't frighten me . " " Good . You do n't frighten me , either . " She laughs . " Nobody frightens you . " " Now there you 're wrong . Everybody frightens me . " " Your father even ? " " Oh , he 's very frightening . " " When will you show me your secret ? " " Maybe I wo n't . It 's too horrible . " " Peter , please do . Please . " " Listen . " " What ? " " I like you . " He can not quite say " love " ; it might prove unfair . " I like you . " " You wo n't . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Partly . I 'll show you at the half . If I keep my nerve . " " You do frighten me now . " " Do n't let me . Hey . You have such beautiful skin . "  | " You always say that . Why ? It 's just skin . " He ca n't answer and she pulls her arm away from being stroked . " Let 's watch the game . Who 's ahead ? " He looks up at the new combination clock and electric scoreboard , Gift of the Class of 1946 . " They are . " She shouts , a regular lipsticked little fury suddenly , " Come on . " The JVs , five in Olinger 's maroon and gold and five in West Alton 's blue and white , looked dazed and alert at once , glued by the soles of their sneakers to tinted echoes of themselvesinverted in floorshine . Every shoelace , every hair , every grimace of concentration , seems unnaturally sharp , like the details of stuffed animals in a large lit case . Indeed there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ramp of seats ; though a player can look up and spot in the crowd a girl he entered last night ( her whimper , the dryness in the mouth afterwards ) , she is infinitely remote from him , and the event in the parked car quite possibly was imagined . Mark Youngerman with his fuzzy forearm blots sweat from his eyebrows , sees the ball sailing toward him , lifts cupped hands and cushions the tense seamed globe against his chest , flicks his head deceptively , drives in past the West Alton defender , and in a rapt moment of flight drops the peeper . The score is tied . Such a shout goes up as suggests every soul here hangs on the edge of terror . Caldwell is tidying up the ticket receipts as Phillips tiptoes to him and says , " George . You mentioned a missing strip . " " One eight oh oh one to one eight one four five . " " I think I 've placed their whereabouts . " " Jesus , that would be a load off my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has them . " " Zimmerman ? What in hell is he stealing tickets for ? " " Shh . " Phillips glances with an eloquent twist of his mouth in the direction of the supervising principal 's office . In him , conspiracy becomes a species of dandyism . " You know he 's the older boys ' teacher up at the Reformed Sunday School . " " Sure . They swear by him up there . " " And did you notice Reverend March coming in tonight ? " " Yeah , I waved him through . I would n't take his money . " " That was right . The reason he 's here , about forty of the Sunday School were given free tickets and came to the game in a group . I went up to him and suggested he sit on the stage , but he said no he thought he 'd be better off standing at the rear of the auditorium and keep an eye out ; about half the boys come from up in Ely , where they do n't have a ReformedChurch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance . Her long yellow coat swings unbuttoned , her bun of red hair is breakingloose from its pins ; has she been running ? She smiles at Caldwell and nods at Phillips ; Phillips is one little biddy she could never warm to . Caldwell is another matter ; he brings out what might be , for all she knows , her maternal instinct . Any tall man is automatically on her good side ; she is that simple . Contrariwise a man shorter than herself seems to her to be offensive . Caldwell amiably lifts one of his wart-freckled hands in greeting ; the sight of her does him no harm . As long as Mrs. Hummel is on the premises he feels the school is not entirely given over to animals . She has a mature tomboy 's figure : shallow-breasted , long-legged , with something expressive and even anxious about the narrow length of her freckled wrists and forearms . The primeval female massiveness is liin/ited to her hips and thighs ; these thighs , swinging oval and alabaster from a blue gym-suit , show to fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeds the first bloom , and then a bloom upon that . Human biology , up to a point , is not impatient . Still she remains childless . The small triangular foreheadframed between two copper wings seems vexed ; her nose is a fraction long and a touch pointed ; there is a bit of the ferret about her face , and when she grins , gums engagingly slip into sight . Caldwell calls to her , " Did you have a game today ? " She coaches the girls ' basketball team . " Just got back , " she says , not entirely halting . " We were humiliated . I just gave Al his supper and I thought I 'd come see what the boys could do . " She is gone up the hall , toward the rear of the auditorium . " That woman certainly loves basketball , " Caldwell says . " Al works too long hours , " Phillips says , more darkly . " Shegets bored . " " She 's cheerful-looking , though , and when you get to my state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your health worries me ' . " " The Lord loves a cheerful corpse , " Caldwell says , rudely exuberant , and asks boldly , " Now what 's the secret about these tickets ? " " It 's not an actual secret . Reverend March told me that Louis suggested that as an incentive to regular Sunday-school attendancea half-way prize be given , for perfect attendance up to the first of the year . " " So he sneaks in and swipes my basketball tickets . " " Not so loud . They 're not your tickets , George . They 're the school 's tickets . "  | " Well I 'm the poor horse 's neck who has to account for them . " " It 's just paper , look at it that way . Mark it Charity ' in your books . I 'll back you up if it 's ever questioned . " " Did you ask Zimmerman what happened to the other hundred ? You said forty kids came . He ca n't give away the other hundred , next thing every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door with a free ticket . " " George , I know you 're upset . But there 's nothing to be gained in exaggeration . I have n't spoken to him and I do n't see that anything would be gained . Make a note for charity and we 'll consider the matter closed . Louis tends to be highhanded , I know ; but it 's for a good cause . " Secure in his knowledge that his friend 's prudent advice must be taken , Caldwell indulges in a final verbal expenditure . " Those tickets represent ninety dollars of theoretical money ; I resent like hell handing them over to the dear old Reformed Sunday School . " He means it . Olinger is , except for a few marginal sects like the Jehovah 's Witnesses and the Baptists and the Roman Catholics , divided in friendly rivalry between the Lutherans and the Reformeds , the Lutherans having an advantage of numbers and the Reformeds an advantage of wealth . Born a Presbyterian , Caldwell became in the Depressiona Lutheran like his wife , and , surprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he associates with Zimmerman and Calvin , whom he associates with everythingmurky and oppressive and arbitrary in the universal kingdom . Vera enters the back of the auditorium by one of the broad doors that are propped open on little rubber-footed legs whichp233unhinge at a kick from snug brass fittings . She sees that ReverendMarch is over toward the corner , leaning against the stack of folding chairs that for assemblies and stage plays and P. T. A. meetings are unfolded and arranged on the flat area which is now the basketball court . Several boys , legs dangling in dungarees , perch illegally on top of this stack , and through this back area men and boys and one or two girls are standing , craning to see over one another 's shoulders , some standing on chairs set between the open doors . Two men in their middle twenties greet Vera shyly and stand aside to make room for her . Sheds known to them but they are forgotten by her . They are ex-heroes of the type who , for many years , until a wife or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear at high school athletic events , like dogs tormented by a site where they imagine they have buried something precious . Increasingly old and slack , the apparition of them persists , conjured by that phantasmal procession  --  indoorsand outdoors , fall , winter , and spring  --  of increasingly young and unknown high school athletes who themselves , imperceptibly , filter in behind them to watch also . Their bearing , hushed and hurt , contrasts decisively with that of the students in the slope of seats ; here skins and hair and ribbons and flashy clothes make a single fabric , a billowing , twinkling human pennant . Vera squints and the crowd dissolves into oscillatingatoms of color . Apparently polarized by the jiggling event before them , in fact these dots agitate sideways , toward one another , aimed by secret arrow-shaped seeds . Sensing this makes Vera proud and serene and competent . For a long time she does not deign a hint of a sideways glance in the direction of Reverend March , who for his part has been rendered rapt by the gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jostle of bodies and arrive , chinking , at his eyes.  |p234This  minister is a tall and handsome man with a bony brown face and a crisp black mustache fastidiously shaped . The war made him . In 1939 he was a tender , small-boned graduate , not quite twenty-five , of a coal regions seminary . He felt effeminate and enfeebled by doubts . Theology had given his doubts shape and depth . In retrospect the religiosity that had prompted his vocation seemed , insofar as it was not sheerly his mother 's will , a sickly phosphorescence exuded by sexual uncertainty . His tinny voice mocked his prevaricating sermons with squeakings . He feared his deacons and despised his message . In 1941 war rescued him . He enlisted , not as a chaplain but as a fighting man . By this path he hoped to escape questions he could not answer . So it proved . He crossed water and the furies could not follow . They made him a lieutenant . In North Africa he kept himself and five others alive on three canteens of water for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight feet wide on the spot he had darted from thirty seconds before . In the hills above Rome , they made him a captain . Peace found him unscratched . His voice alone had resistedtempering . He returned , absurdly , to his mild vocation . Was it absurd ? No ! He discovered , scraping away the rubble , his mother 's faith , baked by the heat to an enduring hardness , strange of shape but undeniable , like a splash of cooled slag . He was alive . Life is a hell but a glorious hell . Give God this glory . Though March 's voice is still small his silences are grand . His eyes are black as coals set in the sharp brown cheekbones ; he carries like a scar the mustache which he left of the beard of battle . With his sense of uniform he retains the Roman collar whenever he appears in public . To Vera , approaching secretly through the hall beyond the open doors , his backwards collar seems so romantic her breath isp235suspended : a knife of pure white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat . " Your prayers were not with me this afternoon , " she breathes , breathless . " Hello ! Were your girls beaten ? " " Mm . " Already she pretends , and indeed slightly feels , some boredom . She gazes toward the game and makes the golden leaves of her coat swirl with her hands in the pockets . " Do you always attend boys ' games ? " " Should n't I ? To learn things ? Did you play basketball ? " " No , I was extremely inept as an adolescent . I was always picked last . " " It 's hard to believe . " " That 's the mark of a great truth . " She winces at this edge of evangelism in him , and sighs heavily , explaining , as if in response to an impatient insistence of his , " The fact is , if you teach here a while you get so you ca n't stay out of the building . It 's an occupational disease . If the school is lit , you wander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mm . " His voice disappoints her . She wonders if it is a naturallaw , that men the proper size must have inadequate voices . Must she always , in some tiny facet of every encounter , be disappointed ? In revenge , she teases him with , " You 've changed since you were always picked last . " He laughs curtly , baring his quick tobaccoish teeth in an instant , as if a longer laugh would betray his position : a captain'slaugh . " The last shall be first , " he says . This a little bewilders her , ignorant of the allusion yet aware , from the satisfied tension of his tan chiselled lips , that it is one . She gazes past his shoulder and , as always whenp236threatened by the possibility that she is stupid , lets her eyes go out of focus , knowing that this renders more profound their brown beauty . " Why  --  ? " She stops her lips . " I wo n't ask . " " Ask what ? " " Never mind . I forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . Ask , and ye shall receive . " He hopes that by sprinkling the salt of blasphemy on her tail he can hold her here , this golden dove , this sandy sparrow . He suspects she was going to ask him why he had not married . A difficult question ; he has sometimes searched for the answer . Perhaps it was that war displays women unflatteringly . Their price goes down , and it is discovered that they will sell for any price  --  a candy bar , a night 's sleep . Their value is not present to themselves , but is given to them by men . Having been forced to perceive this makes one slow to buy . But this would not be an answer that could be spoken . In truth this was the question on her mind . Was he some kind of nance ? She distrusts all ministers and men too well groomed . He is both . She asks , " Why are you here tonight ? I 've never seen you at a game before , you only ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , " he answers , " to shepherd forty pagan brutes from my Sunday school . For some reason I never understood , Zimmermanshowered basketball tickets like manna all over them last Sunday . " She laughs . " But why ? " Anything that diminishes Zimmermanmakes her heart gush gratefully . " Why ? " His raven eyebrows lift in two shapely arcs above his rounded eyes whose irises , full in the light , are not black but a fleckish dark gray , as if the jelly were veiling gunpowder . This sense of danger , of dreadful things he has seen , excitesp237her . Her breasts seem to float on her ribs warmly ; she suppressesan instinct to bring her hands to them . Her wet lips are framed to release laughter even before his jokes , indignant questions , are out . " Why does anything like this happen to me ? " he sternly asks , slightly pop-eyed . " Why do all the ladies of my parish bake cupcakes once a month and sell them to each other ? Why does the town drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people keep showing up in fancy hats on Sunday morning to hear me prattle about an old book ? " Successful beyond his expectations , the warm swirl of her laughter lifting him deliciously , he goes on and on in this vein , much as a foolhardy full-blooded Sioux in his outfit used to war-dance around the spot where a land mine had been marked as buried . Though his faith is intact and as infrangible as metal , it is also like metal dead . Though he can go and pick it up and test its weight whenever he wishes , it has no arms with which to reach and restrain him . He mocks it . And Vera for her part is delighted to have elicited this ; it seems like an accelerated sequence in an old silent movie , this sketch he draws of the church as an empty house where people keep calling and nodding politely and saying " Thank you " as if the host were there . The bubbles tumble from her stomach to her lungs and explode , iridescent , in her glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , all she requires , that he have the power to make her laugh . In laughter her girlhood , her virginityis reborn . Her mouth , outlined in the cerise rim of lipstickthat has not rubbed off , stretches to let her gladness out ; her gums show , her face , flushed , becomes numbingly vivid , a Gorgon 's head of beauty , of life . A dungareed boy on top of the stack , riding on this rickety raft the ocean of tumult , looks over the edge to find the source of this new noise . He seesp238below him a head of red hair like a monstrous orange fish sink with a loose twist of one shimmering coil against the horizontalslats of  --  stained wood . Weak with laughter , Vera has lurched and leans her limp weight back . The minister 's flecked eyes melt and his crisp lips pucker bashfully , puzzled . He leans back to join her ; an irregularity in the stack makes a ledge the height of a mantel where with a remnant of his captain 's composure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mass of the crowd ; a bower has been made. . and he upon thy lap oft flings himself back , conquered by the eternal wound of love ; and then pillowing his shapely neck ( tereti cervice ) upon thee and looking up he feeds with love his greedy eyes , gazing wistfully towards thee ( inhians in te , dea ) , while , as he lies back , his breath hangs upon thy lips . The JV game is over . Though Mark Youngerman 's face is purple , his panting painful , and his body as slippery as an amphibian 's , Olinger lost . The buzz of the crowd changes pitch . Many leave their seats . Those who step outside discover that it is snowing . This discovery is ever surprising , that Heaven can so prettily condescend . Snow puts us with Jupiter Pluvius among the clouds . What a crowd ! What a crowd of tiny flakes sputters downward in the sallow realm of the light above the entrance door ! Atoms and atoms and atoms and atoms . A furry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pike travel slower , windshield wipers flapping , headlight beams nipped and spangled in the ceaseless flurry . The snow seems only to exist where light strikes it . A trolley car gliding toward Alton appears to trail behind it a following of slowly fallingp239fireflies . What an eloquent silence reigns ! Olinger under the vast violet dome of the stormstruck night sky becomes yet one more Bethlehem . Behind a glowing window the infant God squalls . Out of zero all has come to birth . The panes , tinted by the straw of the crib within , hush its cries . The world goes on unhearing . The town of white roofs seems a colony of deserted temples ; they feather together with distanceand go gray , melt . Shale I-lilt is invisible . A yellowness broods low in the sky ; above Alton in the west a ruby glow seeps upward . From the zenith a lavender luminosity hangs pulseless , as if the particular brilliance of the moon and stars had been dissolved and the solution shot through with a low electric voltage . The effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The air presses downward with an unstressed sibilance , a pedal note , the base C of the universal storm . The streetlights strung along the pike make a forestage of brightnesswhere the snowfall , compressed and expanded by the faintest of winds , like an actor postures  --  pausing , plunging . Upward countercurrents suspend snow which then with the haste of love flies downward to gravity 's embrace ; the alternationsof density conjure an impression of striding legs stretching upward into infinity . The storm walks . The storm walks but does not move on . Those who remain inside the school are ignorant of the weather and yet like fish taken up by a swifter ocean current they sense some change . The atmosphere of the auditorium accelerates . Things are not merely seen but burst into vision . Voices carry further . Hearts wax bold . Peter leads Penny back up the aisle and into the hall . His head pounds with the promisehe has made but she seems to have forgotten it . He is too young to know those points , those invisible intersections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detected . He buys her a Coke and himself a lemon-lime at the bin which the Student Council operates in the main hall . Its vicinity is busy ; the couple is pushed to the wall . Here hang framed photographs of bygone track teams in a long chronologicalrow . Penny tips the bottle with her little finger extendedand licks her lips in the wake of the sip and looks at him with eyes whose green seems newly minted . Secret knowledge of his spots obsesses him ; should he tell her ? Would it , by making her share the shame , wed them inextricably ; make her , by bondage of pity , his slave ? Can he , so young , afford a slave ? On fire with such cruel calculations , he turns his red back on the crowd shoving and sluggishly interweavingaround the soft-drink bin . When an iron hand seizes his arm above the elbow and brutally squeezes , it might be one of a hundred idiots . But it is Mr. Zimmerman , the Supervising Principal . Simultaneouslyhe has seized Penny 's arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Two prize students , " he says , as if of two netted birds . Peter angrily tugs his arm away from the grip . The grip tightens . " He begins to look like his father 's son , " Zimmerman says to Penny , and to Peter 's horror Penny echoes the principal'ssmirk . Zimmerman is shorter than Peter but taller than Penny . Up close , his head , asymmetric , half-bald , and nodding , seems immense . His nose is bulbous , his eyes watery . An absoluterage against this fool wells up in the boy . " Mr. Zimmerman , " he says , " I 've been meaning to ask you something . " " Full of questions like his father , " Zimmerman says to Penny , and drops his hold on Peter 's arm but not hers . She isp241wearing a pink angora sweater from whose very short sleeves her bare arms thrust like legs out of underpants . The old man 's broad fingers indent the cool fat ; his thumb wanders back and forth across an inch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter says , " what are the humanist values implicit in the sciences ? " Penny titters nervously , her face gone purely stupid . Zimmermanasks , " Where did you hear such a phrase ? " Peter has overreached . He blushes in consciousness of betrayalbut in the momentum of pride can not stop . " I saw it in a report you wrote on my father . " " He shows you those ? Do you think he should ? " " I do n't know . What affects him affects me . " " I am wondering if it does n't place too great a responsibility on you . Peter , I value your father enormously . But he does have , as of course you can see  --  you 're an intelligent boy  --  a tendency to be irresponsible . " Of all possible charges this seems to Peter the least applicable . His father , that blind blanched figure staggering down the steps in a debtor 's cardboard box . . . " It places , " Zimmerman goes on gently , " a greater responsibilityon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awfully responsible , " Peter says , hypnotized by the meditative caressing action of Zimmerman 's thumb on Penny 's arm . She submits to it ; this is a revelation . To think he was about to confide in this whore , this doll , his precious spots . Zimmerman 's smile stretches . " Of course , you sec him from a different angle than I do . I saw my own father in the same way . " They see many things the same way , these two ; they both see other people as an arena for self-assertion . There is ap242ground of kinship which makes their grappling possible . Peterfeels this , feels a comradeship intertwined with antagonism and a confidence in the midst of his fear . The principal has blundered in seeking intimacy ; distance and silence are always most powerful . Peter stares him in the face and , an instant short of irrevocable rudeness , glances away . He feels the side of his neck blushing in the manner of his mother . " He 's terribly responsible , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stomach X-rays but what he 's more worried about is a little strip of basketball tickets he ca n't find . " Zimmerman quickly blurts , " Tickets ? " To Peter 's surprise this seems to have scored . The principal 's wrinkles are shadowedforth at the new tilt of his head ; he seems old . TriumphantlyPeter feels descend upon him , his father 's avenger , this advantage over the antagonist : he has more years to live . Ignorantand impotent here and now , in the dimension of the future he is mighty . Zimmerman murmurs , seems in his mind to stumble . " I 'll have to speak to him about this , " he says , half to himself . Overreached . The possibility of a truly disastrous betrayal makes Peter 's stomach grovel as it used to when he was a child and running tardy clown the pike to elementary school . " Must you ? " His voice thins in pleading , becomes infantile . " I mean , I do n't want to have gotten him into any trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand leaves Penny 's arm and , finger braced against the thumb to flick , comes toward Peter 's eye . It is a nightmare second ; Peter blinks , his mind blank . He feels the breath being crushed from him . The hand glides past his face and softly snaps a face in the framed picture by Peter 's shoulder on the wall . " This is me , " Zimmerman says.  |p243It  is a photograph of the O. H. S. track team in 1919 . They are all wearing old-fashioned black undershirts and the managerwears white ducks and a straw hat . Even the trees in the background  --  which are the trees of the Poorhouse Lane , only smaller than they are now  --  look old-fashioned , like pressed flowers . A brownness hangs unsteadily beneath the surface of the photograph . Zimmerman 's finger , which with its glazed nail and crinkled knuckle is solid and luminous in the now , holds firm under the tiny face of then . Peter and Penny have to look . Though as a trackman he was slimmer and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizable . The heavy nose set at an uneasy angle to the gently twisted mouth whose plane is not strictly parallel to the line of the eyebrows gave his young face that air of muddled weight , of unfathomable expectation and reluctant cruelty , ' which rendershim in his prime of age so irresistible a disciplinarian even to those who think they have found it within themselves to be defiant and mock . " It is you , " Peter says weakly . " We never lost a meet . " The finger , dense with existence , everpresent , drops away . Without another word to the young couple Zimmerman moves off down the hall , huge-hacked . Students jostle to clear him a path . The hall is emptying , the varsity game beginning . The pressure of Zimmerman 's fingers have left yellow ovals in Penny 's naked arm . She rubs the arm briskly and grimaces in disgust . " I feel I should take a bath , " she says . Peter realizes he does love her really . They had been equally helpless in Zimmerman'sgrip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to the auditorium ; but at the hall 's end he bucks the double doors and leads her up the dark stairs . This is forbidden . Often at night functions a padlock is placed on these doors but this time thep244janitors forgot . Peter glances behind them nervously ; all who might cry " Halt " have hastened to see the game commence . On the halfway landing they are out of sight . The bulb burning over the girls ' entrance below the steel-mullioned window here casts upward in distorted rhomboids enough light to see by . There must be light enough for her to see . Her naked arms seem silver , her crimson lips black . His own shirt seems black . He unbuttons one sleeve . " Now this is a very sad secret , " he says . " But because I love you you should know it . " " Wait . " " What ? " He listens to learn if she has heard someone coming . " Do you know what you 're saying ? What do you love about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrates like an encirclingocean . Here on this landing he feels dry and cool . He shivers , afraid , now , of what he has begun to do . " I love you , " he tells her , " because in the dream I told you about when you turned into a tree I wanted to cry and pray . " " Maybe you just love me in dreams . " " When is that ? " He touches her face . Silver . Her mouth and eyes are black and still and terrible like the holes of a mask . She says gently , " You think I 'm stupid . " " I 've thought so . But you do n't seem so now . " " I 'm not beautiful . " " You are now . " " Do n't kiss me . The lipstick will smear . " " I 'll kiss your hand . " Ile does , and then slips her hand inside his open sleeve . " Does my arm feel funny ? " " It feels warm . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . . . a little . What is it ? " " It 's this . " Peter pulls back the sleeve and shows her the underside of his arm ; the spots look lavender in the cold diffused light . There are less of them than he had expected . Penny asks , " What is it ? I lives ? " " It 's a thing called psoriasis I 've had all my life . It 's horrible , I hate it . " " Peter ! " Her hands lift up his head from the gesture of sobbing . His eyes are dry and yet the gesture did release somethingreal . " It 's on my arms and legs and it 's worst on my chest . Do you want to see it there ? " " I do n't care . " " You hate me now , do n't you ? You 're disgusted . I 'm worse than Zimmerman grabbing you . " " Peter , do n't just say things to hear me contradict them . Show me your chest . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm curious . " He lifts his shirt and T-shirt underneath and stands in the half-light half-skinned . He feels like a slave ready for flogging , or like that statue of the Dying Captive which Michelangelo did not fully release from the stone . Penny bends to look . Her fingers brush his chilled skin . " Is n't that strange ? " she says . " They go in little groups . " " In the summer it pretty well goes away , " he tells her , pullingdown his shirts . " When I grow up I 'm going to spend the winters in Florida and then I wo n't have it . " " Is this what your secret was ? " " Yes . I 'm sorry . "  | " I expected something much worse . " " What could be worse ? In a full light it 's really ugly , and I ca n't do a thing about it except apologize . " She laughs , a glimpse of silver in his ears . " Are n't you silly ? I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " " My God , does it ? Badly ? " " No . It 's not noticeable at all . " He knows she is lying , yet does not attempt to make her tell the truth . Instead he asks , " Then you do n't mind it ? " " Of course not . You ca n't help it . It 's part of you . " " Is that really how you feel ? " " If you knew what love was , you would n't even ask . " " Are n't you good ? " In accepting her forgiveness he sinks to his knees , there in the corner of the halfway landing , and presses his face against her cloth belly . His knees ache in a minute ; in relieving them of pressure his face slides lower . And his hands of themselves slide up silver and confirm what his face has found through the cloth of her skirt , a fact monstrousand lovely : where her legs meet there is nothing . Nothingbut silk and a faint dampness and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its center , this innocence , this absence , this intimate curve subtly springy in its sheath of silk . Through the wool of her skirt he kisses his own fingertips . " No , please , " Penny says , her hand seeking to pull him up by his hair . He hides from her in her , fitting his face tighter against that concave calm ; yet even here , his face held in the final privacy , the blunt probing thought of his father 's death visits him . Thus he betrays her . When Penny , pinned off balance , repeats " Please , " the honest fear in her voice gives him an excuse to relent . Rising , he looks away from her throughp247the window beside them and observes , wonder following wonder , " It 's snowing . " In the lavatory Caldwell is puzzled by the word BOOK gouged in square capitals in the wall above the urinal . Close examination reveals that this word has been laid over another ; the F had been extended and closed to make a B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the K left as was . Willing to learn , even by the last flash of light before annihilation , he absorbs the fact , totally new to him , that every FUCK could be made into a BOOK . But who would do such a thing ? The psychology of the boy ( it must have been a boy ) who altered the original word , who desecrated the desecration , is a mystery to him . The mystery depresses him ; leaving the lavatory , he tries to enter that mind , to picture that hand , and as he walks down the hall the heaviestweight yet seems laid upon his heart by that unimaginable boy 's hand . Could his son have done it ? Zimmerman apparently has been waiting for him . The hall is all but empty ; Zimmerman sidles from the stage entrance to the auditorium . " George . " He knows . " George , have you been worried about some tickets ? " " I 'm not worried , it 's been explained to me . I marked them Charity in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about it . Apparently I was wrong . " " I should n't have gotten the wind up . Mental confusion , is what they call it . " " I 've had an interesting talk with your son Peter . " " Huh ? What did the kid tell you ? "  | " He told me many things . " Mim Herzog , he knows I know , the goose is cooked , it 's out in the open and can never be put back . Never ever , it 's a onewaystreet we 're on , ignorance is bliss . The tall teacher feels whiteness fill his body from his toes to his scalp . A weariness , a hollowness and conviction of futility beyond anything he has known before seizes him . A film too thick to be sweat makes pasty his palms and brow as his skin struggles to reject this seizure . " He did n't mean to cause me any trouble , the poor kid does n't have a clue , " Caldwell tells the principal . The pain , the tireless pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rift in clouds that Caldwell 's glimpse of Mrs. Herzog is at the bottom of his fear and his mind exults , fairly dances in the security of being on top and able to maneuver . Expertly he skims , like a butterfly teasing a field , above the surface of the dread in the knobbed drained face opposite him . " I was struck , " he says glidingly , " by Peter'sconcern for you . I think he believes that teaching is too great a strain on your health . " Here comes the ax , praise be to God for little blessings , the suspense is over . Caldwell wonders if the dismissal slip will be yellow , as it was with the telephone company . " Is that what the kid thinks , huh ? " " He may be right . I lc 's a perceptive boy . " " He gets that from his mother . I wish to hell he had inheritedmy weak head and her beautiful body . " " George , I 'd like to speak to you frankly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of dizziness simultaneous with an immense restlessness overtakes the teacher ; he yearns to swing his arms , twirl around , collapse on the floor and havep249a nap , anything but stand here and take it , take it from this smug bastard who knows it all . Zimmerman has risen to his most masterly professional self . His sympathy , his cadences of tact , his comprehensive considerationare exquisite . His body almost aromatically exudes his right and competence to supervise . " If at any time , " he says in gentle measured syllables , " you feel unable to go on , please come to me and tell me . It would be a disservice to yourself and to your students to continue . A sabbatical could be arrangedeasily . You think of it as a disgrace ; you should n't . A year of thought and study is a very common thing for a teacher in the middle of his career . Remember , you are only fifty . The school would survive ; with so many of these veterans returning , the teacher shortage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lint , spittle , poverty , stuck-together stuff in gutters  --  all the trash and chaos behind the made world pours through the rent opened by this last subtle prick . Caldwell says , " Christ , the only place I can go if I leave this school is the junkyard . I 'm no good for anything else . I never was . I never studied . I never thought . I 've always been scared to . My father studied and thought and on his deathbed he lost his religion . " Zimmerman lifts a benevolent palm . " If my last visitation reportis bothering you , remember that it is my duty to tell the truth . But I tell the truth , to quote St. Paul , in love . " " I know that . You 've been damn good to me these years ; I do n't know why you 've babied me along , but you have . " He bites back the urge to tell a lie , to blurt out that he did n't see Mim Herzog coming out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did see her . He 'd be God-damned if he 'd beg.  |p250The  least you can do is walk in front of the firing squad on your own two legs . " You 've received no favors , " Zimmerman says . " You 're a good teacher . " On this amazing statement Zimmerman turns and walks away , with not a word about Mim or dismissal . Caldwell ca n't believe his ears . Did he miss something ? He wonders if the ax fell and was so sharp he did n't feel it , if the bullets just passed right through him like a ghost . What had Zimmerman , underneath it all , said ? The man turns back . " Oh , and George . " Now here it comes . Cat and mouse . " About the tickets . " " Yeah . " " You need n't mention it to Phillips . " Zimmerman crookedly winks . " You know how fussy he is . " " O. K. I got your meaning . " Zimmerman 's office door closes , the frosted glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a symptom of disease that is making his kneecaps tingle and his hands feel numb . The time has arrived for him to use his legs again and they are slow to obey . His torso swims down the hall . Rounding the corner , the teacher surprises Gloria Davis the hopped-up bitch leaning against the wall allowing young Kegerise to rub his knee between her legs . With his I. Q. he ought to know better . Caldwell ignores them and pushes into the auditorium past some Olinger High grads , Jackson is one of them and he ca n't recall the other 's name , standing there with their mouths open looking down at the game . Living corpses , they did n't even have the sense to stay out once they got out . He remembersJackson always coming to him after class whining about special projects and his love of astronomy and making his ownp251telescope out of mailing tubes and magnifying glass lenses and now the poor bohunk was a plumber 's apprentice at 75  --  an hour and sopping it up in beer . What in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending like that ? He shies away from these his old students , the hunch in their shoulders reminds him of the great whole skinned carcasses hung on hooks in the freezer of a big Atlantic City hotel he once worked for . Dead meat . In veering away Caldwell comes face to face with old Kenny Klagle the auxiliary cop with his white brushed hair and baffled pale eyes and tender grandmotherly smile , solemnlytricked out in a blue uniform and paid five dollars a night to be on the premises ; he stands beside a bronze fire extinguisherand they are two of a kind , in an emergency both would probably just sputter . Klagle 's wife left him years ago and he never knew what hit him . Never even knew enough to drop dead . Waste , rot , hollowness , noise , stench , death : in fleeing the many visages which this central thing wears Caldwell as if by God 's grace comes upon , over in the corner , leaning against the stacked folding chairs beside Vera Hummel , Reverend March in his clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you know me , " Caldwell says . " My name is George Caldwell and I teach general science here in the school . " March has to leave off laughing with Vera to take the offeredhand and say , his smile pointedly patient under the curt mustache , " I do n't believe we have met , but of course I 've heard of you and know you by sight . " " I 'm a Lutheran so I guess I 'm out of your flock , " Caldwell explains . " I hope I 'm not interrupting you and Vera here ; the fact is I 'm badly troubled in my mind . "  |p252With  a nervous glance at Vera , who has turned her head and might slip from his side , March asks , " Oh . What about ? " " Everything . The works . I ca n't make it add up and I 'd be grateful for your viewpoint . " Now March 's glance travels everywhere but into the face opposite him as he looks through the crowd for some rescue from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentiallydiffer from the Lutheran , " he says . " It 's my hope that someday all the children of the Reformation will be reunited . " " Correct me if I 'm wrong , Reverend , " Caldwell says , " but as I understand it the difference is the Lutherans say Jesus Christ is the only answer and the Calvinists say whatever happens to you , happens to you , is the answer . " In his anxiety and anger and embarrassment March reaches sideways and almost seizes Vera bodily to keep her with him during this preposterous interruption . " That 's ridiculous , " he says . " Orthodox Calvinism  --  and I count myself more orthodoxthan not  --  is fully as Christocentric as the Lutheran doctrines . Perhaps more so , since we exclude the saints and any substantive Eucharistic transformation . " " I 'm a minister 's son , " Caldwell explains . " My old man was a Presbyterian , and as I understand it from him there are the elect and the non-elect , the ones that have it and the ones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it are never going to get it . What I could never ram through my thick skull was why the ones that do n't have it were created in the first place . The only reason I could figure out was that God had to have somebody to fry down in Hell . " The Olinger High basketball team forges into the lead and March has to raise his voice furiously to make himself heard . " The doctrine of predestination , " he shouts , " must be un/derstood as counterbalanced by the doctrine of God 's infinite mercy . " The crowd noise subsides . " That 's my problem , I guess , " Caldwell says . " I ca n't see how it 's infinite if it never changes anything at all . Maybe it 's infinite but at an infinite distance  --  that 's the only way I can picture it . " March 's gray eyes arc exploding with pain and irritation as the danger of Vera 's leaving him grows . " " Phis is burlesque ! " he shouts . " A basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you come and visit me in my study sometime , Mr.  --  ? " . " Caldwell . George Caldwell . Vera here knows me . " Vera turns back with a wide smile . " Somebody invoke my name ? I do n't understand a thing about theology . " " Our discussion of it has just been concluded , " Reverend March tells her . " Your friend Mr. Caldwell has some very singular adverse notions about poor abused John Calvin . " " I do n't know a thing about him , " Caldwell protests , his voice becoming plaintive and high and unpleasant . " I 'm trying to learn . " " Come to my study any morning but Wednesdays , " March tells him . " I 'll lend you some excellent books . " 1 lc firmly restoreshis attention to Vera , presenting to Caldwell a profile as handsome and final as if stamped onto an imperial coin . Make Nero look tame , small town aristocrats , Caldwell thinks , retreating . Heavy and giddy with his own death , sluggishand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the adamantine pressures of the oceanic depths , he moves along behind the backs of spectators and searches the crowd for the sight of his son . At last he spots Peter 's narrow head in a row on the right nearp254the front . Poor kid , needs a haircut . Caldwell 's work tonight is done and he wants to go down and get Peter and go home . Humanity , which has so long entranced him , disgusts him packed and tangled like germs in this overheated auditorium . Even Cassie 's empty land by contrast would look good . And the snow is piling up outside . And the kid could use the sleep . But beside Peter 's head there is a small round blondness . Caldwell recognizes the ninth-grade Fogleman girl . He had had her brother two years ago , the Foglemans were the kind who would eat your heart and then wash the rest down the sink . Brutal Germans , brrr . It dawns upon him that she and Peter are not sitting next to each other by accident . With that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers seeing Peter and Penny paired here and there in the halls . By the drinking fountain giggling . Against the annex lockers leaning broodily . Framed , blotted together into one silhouette , against the milky light of a far doorway . He had seen these things but they had n't sunk in before . Now they do . The sadness of the abandonedwells up . A great shout arises as Olinger 's lead expands , and the powerful panic of it licks with four hundred tongues the lining of the teacher 's strained innards . Olinger wins . Peter rarely takes his eyes from the game but hardly sees it , so possessed is his inner eye by the remembrance of pressing his face into the poignant absence between Penny 's thighs . Who would have thought even an instant 's access would be granted him , so young ? Who would have thought thunder would not peal and punishing spirits flap awake ? Who of all those pressed into this bright auditorium would dream what brimming darkness he had , kiss-lipped , sipped ? The memory of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not darep255turn his face to his love for fear she will see herself there , a ghostly beard , and cry out in horror and shame , every pore on her nose vivid . And when he and his father at last leave the school and go into the snow the multitude of flakes seems to have been releasedby his profanation . In the pervasive descent an eddy of air now and then angrily flings a tinkling icy handful upward into his warm face . Peter had forgotten what snow is . It is an immense whispering whose throat seems to be now here , now there . He looks at the sky and it answers his eyes with a mauve , a lilac , a muffled yellow-pearl . Only after sonic moments of focusing does the downflow visually materialize for him , as an edge of a wing , and then an entire broadening wing of infinitesimalfeathers , broadening into the realization that this wing is all about them and crowds the air to four hidden horizonsand beyond . Wherever he looks , now that his eyes are attuned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'he town and all its houses are besieged by a murmuring multitude . Peter pauses under the high light that guards the near corner of the parking lot . What he sees at his feet puzzles him . On the whiteness that has already fallen small dark spots arc swarming like gnats . They dart this way and that and then vanish . There seems to be a center where they vanish . As his eyes travel outward he sees dots speeding toward this center ; the further away they are , the faster they speed inward . Ile traces a few : all vanish . The phenomenon scans totally ghostly . Then the constriction of his heart cases as the rational explanation comes to him . These are the shadows of snowflakescast by the light above him . Directly under the light , the wavering fall of the particles is projected as an erratic oscilla/tion , but away from the center , where the light rays strike obliquely , the projection parabolically magnifies the speed of the shadow as it hastens forward to meet its flake . The shadowsstream out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its last instant , vanish as their originals kiss the white plane . It fascinates him ; he feels the universe in all its plastic and endlesslyvariable beauty pinned , stretched , crucified like a butterflyupon a frame of unvarying geometrical truth . As the hypotenuse approaches the vertical the lateral leg diminishes less and less rapidly : always . The busy snowflake shadows seem ants scurrying on the floor of a high castle made all of stone . He turns scientist and dispassionately tries to locate in the cosmography his father has taught him an analogy between the phenomenon he has observed and the " red shift " whereby the stars appear to be retreating at a speed proportionalto their distance from us . Perhaps this is a kindred illusion , perhaps  --  he struggles to picture it  --  the stars are in fact falling gently through a cone of observation of which our earthly telescopes are the apex . In truth everything hangs like dust in a forsaken attic . Passing on a few yards , to where the lamplight merges with the general agitated dimness , Peter does seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shadowsis infinite and a small universe both ends and does not end . His feet begin to hurt with being cold and wet and cosmicthoughts turn sickly in his mind . As if leaving a cramped room he restores his focus to the breadth of the town , where large travelling eddies sway and stride from the sky with a sort of ultimate health . He crawls into the cave of the car with his father and slips off his soaked loafers and tucks his damp stockinged feet underhim . Hurriedly his father backs out of the lot and headsp257up the alley toward Buchanan Road . At first he overaccelerates , so that on the slightest rise the back tires spin . " Boy , " Caldwell says , " this is duck soup . " Revelations have skinned Peter 's nerves and left him highly irritable . " Well why did n't we start for home two hours ago ? " he asks . " We 'll never get up Coughdrop I till . What were you doing at the game so long after the tickets were taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caldwell tells his son slowly , wondering how not to seem to scold the boy . " He said he 'd had a talk with you . " Guilt makes Peter 's voice shrill . " I had to , he grabbed me in the hall . " " You told him about the missing tickets . " " I just mentioned it . I did n't tell him anything . " " Jesus kid , I do n't want to cramp your freedom , but I wish you had n't told him . " " What harm did it do ?  --  it 's the truth . Do n't you want me to tell the truth ? Do you want me to lie all my life ? " " Did you  --  now it does n't matter , but did you tell him about my seeing Mrs. Herzog come out of his office ? " " Of course not . I 've forgotten all about it . Everybody 's forgottenabout it except you . You seem to think the whole world 's some sort of conspiracy . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is I guess my trouble . " " There 's no bottom to get to ! He 's just a befuddled old lech who does n't know what he 's doing . Everybody sees that exceptyou . Daddy , why are you so  --  " He was going to say " stupid " but a vestige of the fourth commandment checks his tongue . "  --  superstitious ? You make everything mean somethingit is n't . Why ? Why ca n't you relax ? It 's so exhausting ! "  |p258In  his fury the boy kicks one foot against the dashboard , makingthe glove compartment tingle . His father 's head is a consideringshadow pinched into the pinheaded cap that is for Peterthe essence of everything obsequious and absurd , careless and stubborn about his father . The man sighs and says , " I do n't know , Peter . I guess it 's part heredity , part environment . " From the weariness of his voice , it seems his final effort of explanation . I 'm killing my father , Peter thinks , amazed . The snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it flares like a spatter of sparks , swoops upward , vanishes , and is replaced by another spatter of sparks . The onrushis continuously abundant . They meet few other cars on the road now . The lights of homes , thinning beyond the poorhouse , are blurred in the blizzard . The heater comes on and its warmth serves to emphasize their isolation . The arc of the windshield wipers narrows with every swipe , until they stare into the storm through two mottled slits of cleared glass . The purr of the motor is drawing them forward into a closing trap . Going down the hill beside the Jewish Cemetery , where Abe Cohn , Alton 's famous Prohibition gangster , lies buried , they skid . Caldwell fights the wheel as the chassis slithers . They slip safely to the bottom , where Buchanan Road ends at Route 122 . On their right , Coughdrop Hill dissolves upwards . A trailer truck like a fleeing house pours down past them and on into Alton , the rapidfire clunk of its chains panicked . When its taillights wink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gradient of the hill increases toward the top . Caldwell pulls out in first and remains in this gear until the wheels begin to spin , and then shifts into second . The car plows upwardp2559some more dozens of yards ; when the wheels start spinning again he shifts desperately into third . The motor stalls . Caldwellyanks out the emergency brake to hold them here on the hill . They are more than half-way up . I he storm sinks sighing into the silence of the motor . The motor restarts but the rear tires can not grip the snow ; rather , the weighty old Buick tends to slip backwards toward the low cable fence that guards the edge of the highway embankment . In the end there is nothing for Caldwell to do but to open his door and , leaning out , using the pink glow of his taillights as his only guide , to back all the way down . He backs beyond the Olinger turnoff onto the flat straightaway between Coughdrop Hill and the next little rise on the road to Alton . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the lower part of the hill , they spin to a halt a little short of where they were stopped the first time . Their previous tracks are dark ruts in their headlights . Suddenly their heads cast shadows forward . A car behind them is coming up the hill . Its lights dilate , blaze like a shout , and sway outward around them ; it is a green Dodge , a ' 47 . Its chains slogging , it continues past them , takes the steepest part of the hill , and , gathering speed , vanishes over the crest . Their own stalled headlights pick out the stamp of the crosslinksin its tracks . The sparkle of the falling snow is steady . " We 'll have to put on chains like that guy , " Peter tells his father . " If we can just get up the next twenty yards we can make it to our road . Fire Hill is n't so steep . " " Did you notice the way that bastard did n't offer to give us a push ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it him-self. "  | " I would have , in his shoes . " " But there 's nobody else like you , Daddy . There 's nobody else like you in the world . " He is shouting because his father has clenched his fists on the steering wheel and is resting his forehead on their backs . It frightens Peter to see his father 's silhouette go out of shape this way . He wishes to call him to himself but the syllable sticks in his throat , unknown . At last he asks shyly , " Do we have chains ? " His father straightens up and says , " One thing , we ca n't put ' em on here , the car 's likely to slip off the jack . We got ta get down on the level again . " A second time , then , he opens his door and leans out and guides the car backwards down the hill , the snow dyed rose by his taillights . A few flakes swirl in through the open door and prick Peter on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets of his pea jacket . Back at the bottom of the hill , they both get out . They open the trunk and try to jack up the rear of the car . They have no flashlight and nothing is easy . The snow at the side of the road is six inches deep and in trying to lift their tires clear of it they jack the rear too high and the car topples sideways and throws the jack upright , with shocking velocity , into the centerof the road . " Jesus , " Caldwell says , " this is a way to get killed . " He makes no motion to retrieve the upright so Peter goes and gets it . Holding the notched bar in one hand , he looks along the side of the road for a rock to block the front tires but the snow conceals all such details of earth . His father stands staring at the tops of pines that hover like dark angels high above them in the storm . Caldwell 's thought seems to his son to be describing wide circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heaven above them . Nowp261his thought returns to the problem underfoot and together the father and son prop the jack under the bumper and this time it holds . They discover then that they are unable to fasten the chains . In the dark and cold it is too late for their blind eyes and numb fingers to learn how . For many minutes Peter watches his father squat and grovel in the snow around the tire . In this time no car passes . Route 122 has ceased to bear traffic . His father seems on the verge of clipping the chain fast when it all slips forward into his hands . With a sob or curse blurred by the sound of the storm Caldwell stands erect and with both hands hurls the tangled web of iron links into the soft snow . The hole it makes suggests a fallen bird . " You should fasten the catch on the inside of the wheel first , " Peter says . He digs up the chains and goes onto his knees and crawls underneath the car . He imagines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wits ' end and the kid just takes the chains and gets under the car and fastens ' em neat as a pin . I do n't know where the kid gets his mechanical ability from . " The wheel slips . Several times as he drapes the cumbersomejacket of links around the tire , the tire lazily turns and shucks its coat of mail like a girl undressing . His father holds the wheel still and Peter tries once more . In the underworldbeneath the car the muted stink of rubber and the parched smells of rust and gas and grease seem breathed syllablesof menace . Peter remembers how the car toppled from the jack , imagines how the springs and axle would crush his skull . One comfort , there is no wind or snowfall here . There is a little catch that holds the clue to fastening the chains . He finds this catch and , reading with his fingertips , deduces how it operates . Almost he succeeds in snapping it . Only a tiny gap remains to close . He applies a pressure thatp262makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetly ; the metal bites deep into his fingers . He prays ; and is appalled to discover that , even when a microscopic concessionwould involve no apparent sacrifice of principle , matteris obdurate . The catch does not close . He squeals in agony , " No ! " His father calls to him , " The hell with it . Get out from under . " Peter obeys , stands , shakes the snow from his jacket . He and his father stare at each other in disbelief . " I ca n't do it , " he says , as if it could be denied . His father says , " You did a damn sight better than I did . Get into the car , we 'll go into Alton for the night . Once a loser , twice a loser . " They put the chains into the trunk and try to lower the car on the jack . But even this piece of retreat proves impossible . The small lever supposed to reverse the jack 's direction swings loose and useless . Each shove on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluttering snow pesters their faces ; the whine of wind distends their eardrums ; the burden on their tempers becomes unendurable . The whole soughing shifting weight of the storm seems hinged on this minute mechanical refusal . " I 'll fix the bastard , " Caldwell announces . " Stand clear , kid . " He climbs into the car , starts the motor , and drives forward . For a moment the jack upright is caught in the tension of a bow and Peter expects to see it go flying like an arrow into the storm . But the metal of the bumper itself yields under this instantof stress , and the next instant drops the car onto its springs with a sound like icicles snapping . A lip-shaped **25;4282;TOOLONG man beside her left . A newspaper remained , and an empty coffee cup to show that he had been there ; and the other man 's gaze now fell directly upon Grace . Both reached for the newspaper at the same time . " No , you take it , " Grace laughed . " No . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace wiped sugar from her lips . He was about thirty-five : a lean , palecomplexionedman , with black hair grown too long down onto his neck . His fingers as he drew them away from the newspaper were outspread , poised , as if he were casting a spell . Grace took off her sunglasses . The man was paler still , with a slight growth of beard . " You take it , " he said . He smiled and showed crooked teeth . Grace looked away , busied herself with her coffee . After a minute or two the man got up and left . The screen door slammed after him . " Anything else you want , miss ? " She shook her head . Powdered sugar had fallen on the counter and into her coffee , even on her skirt . When she tried to rub it off the skirt it seemed to disappear into the material , making it shiny . " This is enough , " she said . She stopped chewing ; an idea came to her . How strange she should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a mistake to die when doughnuts were so good , even in a coffee-pot-like diner like this , with flies circling dazedly overhead . . . . Perhapsit was a mistake , too , to leave without saying good-by , at least to her mother and Tom . But she really felt no regret . If she had the opportunity again she would probably say good-by , but she did not seriously wish to have the opportunity again . It was impossible to care . Not two hundred yards past the diner was the man who had offered her the newspaper . He walked along the highway with his back to traffic . Hearing an automobile , he turned , was about to raise his hand , but , seeing Grace , froze suddenly , stared at her as she passed . Or at the magnificent gleam of her automo/bile , a miracle of chrome and silver-blue finish , a work of art with intricate designs of silver and white arranged so elaborately one might suspect they had some meaning . Grace stopped the car and waited for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not get in at once ; he stared over at her in disbelief . " Get in , " said Grace . They drove off . The man sat back in comfort , as if he was not really surprised . He offered Grace a cigarette . Grace was pleased with his offer . But , " No , no , I do n't smoke , " she said . She turned on the radio . A sudden explosion of music filled the car . The din grew higher and higher and , at its height , a man 's voice broke in . Advertising chewing gum . There was an interval of static . The man leaned toward Grace and said , " Where are you going ? " " For a drive up north , " said Grace . " This is a nice car , " the man said . " My father gave it to me last year , " said Grace . " I picked it out . Only which color , though . He had everything else arranged  --  Ijust picked out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiance 's eyes . " " You getting married ? " the man said . " No , " said Grace , " not any more . " " Oh , you mean you 're married now ? " said the man , looking at her as if he had missed an important point . " No , " said Grace . The man reached forward and turned off the radio . The silence was overwhelming . At about noon they stopped at a country tavern . A muddy parking lot surrounded it . A smell of beer and dampness met them , and the laughter of three or four farm boys who sat at the bar . Grace and the dark man sat down in a booth . " Is there anyone coming after you ? " the man said . " No , " said Grace.  |p102The  man went and got two sweating bottles of beer . Grace forced herself to drink . He drank with great unconcealed passion , panting when he lowered the bottle . His eyes drowned with pleasure , . Then he leaned toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ai n't you ? " " No , " said Grace . She laughed suddenly . " I have never been in trouble . " The man stared , licking the mouth of the bottle . Grace drank one more beer . The man watched her closely . " Your hair is so nice , " he said . He looked dazzled , dazed . Yet it might have been the beer . Even now his attention eased back to it ; he raised the bottle to his lips . His Adam 's apple strained with effort . He put the bottle down and wiped his mouth and resumed his conversation , resumed the same look . " A nice girl like you ought n't to drive by herself . And pick up hitch-hikers . I 'm not a regular hitch-hiker , I 'm just trying to get to Derby ; so it 's different with me . But things happen on the road . " " I have a thousand dollars in my purse , " Grace said . She pretended to say it without thinking . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could they take from me that I would n't want to give ? " The man drank slowly , looking at the scratched table top , and had no answer to that . Back on the road Grace spoke more cheerfully . The beer must have done something to her . " I know you 've seen me before , " she said . " A comic book or movie or television show . Do n't pretend . I know what you 're thinking . " The man sucked on his cigarette with interest but he did not look at her . " You know me . The girl there  --  on the television show  --  has long hair and is a cheer leader , as I was , and there 's a scene to show her and her boy friend dancing some dance . The sponsor is shampoo or something or cereal . And the girl 's father opens his mouth but she comes in first with something smart , or else her kid brother does  --  they show the old bastard ! Then at thep103funeral . " She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but after it 's over and the coffin shut and there 's a miracle or something  --  then  --  then it 's opened again and everybody crowds in to look and what is there left but a tag with string on it , the kind to loop over buttons . It says Size 9-10 , Guaranteed Wash and Wear . ' That 's coming next . " She started giggling . The man slid closer to her . He smoked slowly . " You sure there ai n't anybody after you ? " he said . The highway was broad and empty . On either side scrubland dropped back to woods , scrawny woods , and the early summer sky rose banked and cloudy above them . The sun looked white behind the clouds . " Do you want to turn off the road for a few minutes ? At one of them lanes there ? " the man said . " No , " said Grace . They drove on . A few miles later Grace wanted to pick up another hitchhiker , but the man squeezed her arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , keep going . Keep going , " he said . The hitch-hiker , a kid of about eighteen , stared dispassionately at them as they passed . " That ai n't the kind to pick up , " the man said . He released her . In the mirror the kid 's figure shrank rapidly ; the man did not once glance around . They passed through a town named Jasper shortly after two . A small , main-street town , with high old maroon buildings and brick streets . A bus station in front of which people stood expectantlywith suitcases . Railroad depot , sign crusted over with dust and mud ; scrubby park where five or six boys played , throwing a baseball viciously at one another . " Let me stop and get a room here , " said the man . Grace shrugged her shoulders . He must have taken this for yes , because when she drove right through town and out onto the highway again he looked disappointed and sullen . " Jesus Christ , " he said , flicking ashes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something she liked about countryp104taverns  --  their squalor , their smell of wet , stale beer , the mudscuffedfloors and warped cardboard beer signs . The country boys were sure to be inside , howling at jokes , their booted feet big and nervous . Always their eyes followed her , leaped at her , made their mouths open slowly . In one tavern Grace went back to the women 's rest room . It was no more than a cubbyhole . It stank violently , and its walls were covered with lipstick and eyebrow-pencil scrawls , doodles , obscene symbols , . Grace turned on the rusty faucet and bent to put cold water on her eyes . Drinking was strange to her , drinking in daylight ; it seemed indecent . It made her mind crowded and confused . The cold water did some good . Suddenly there was a kick at the door , a scuffle and giggling . She froze . More giggling . After a minute she opened the door . No one was there . When she returned to the booth she saw the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man stayed there about an hour . Grace paid for the drinks now ; the man did not argue . The country boys drifted toward them and sat in the next booth . Now and then there would be a violent slamming as one pushed another ; then they would giggle together . The man stared in contempt over at them . " I do n't like them bastards , " he said . One of the boys , a gigantic lout , leaned around and peered at Grace , then jerked back . The boys laughed loudly , thumping the table with their fists . " We better get out of here , " the man said nervously . Grace did not answer . She hardly glanced at him or at the conspiring heads of the boys . " Come on , " said the man . " You can go if you want to , " Grace said . A screened window opened onto a tree : silvery-leafed , moving gently in the warm breeze . She watched it . A blue jay flitted into sight and began singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Grace shrugged her shoulders . Boredom settled down upon her like a fog . So it hadp105always been , this past year ; and she could not help but think , though thinking worried her , that it was for this day she had prepared all her life  --  Sunday school coloring books , and Girl Scouts , and braces on her teeth , and report cards , and her mother teaching her to bake , and Tom 's vacuous earnest love for her . " You 've had too much to drink , " the man said . " Come on . " She would have stayed , but resisting was too much trouble . Outside he steadied her , took the car keys from her uncertain fingers . " I 'll drive now , " he said . The afternoon was hot . Grace yawned luxuriously . She thought of her room at home . For twenty years the sun had slanted through the window , illuminating her mirror . Altar of her triumphs , it could do no more than give back to her the certainty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Not for her the pillow-choked anguish of thin-legged , hairy-legged girls with acne-ravaged faces , eyes intense and desperate behind glasses . Not for her the dawdling in girlish groups , drifting back from the library alone : a professor 's kind praise to keep them going . Yet professors had noticed Grace too  --  did they recognize something in her , something beautifully American ? One professorhad even praised her work : a long paper on the RevolutionaryWar . But it was worth nothing , her sense of accomplishmenthad not been enough to keep her going . Worth nothing , nothing . The only thing she really remembered from college was the night in the library , waiting for Tom to take out a book , when she had opened a dusty , disintegrating volume left on a table and had read : The hawk had nae lure , and the horse had nae master , And the faithless hounds thro the woods ran faster . Confronting herself in the mirror at night , she had chanted by rote the dreary litany of promises to herself : I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new life tomorrow . Had the new life now finally come ? She was free . Her automobile raced happily ahead . " I 'm turning off here , " the man said cautiously . The car bumped along a farmer 's lane . Grace looked around but could see nothing except the rutted lane and trees bending over it , foliage locked above it . Great cloudlike nests of spinningworms topped these trees . When the man stopped the car he was panting . " This is all right , " the man said . Grace shrugged her shoulders . " There 's nobody around here . For Christ sake , " he said unaccountably , staring into her face . " Do n't you want to ? " " I do n't care , " Grace said . He got out and came around to her side of the car . Pulling her out , he could not make her look at him ; her eyes were locked to something a few inches to the right of his face . He shook her . " For Christ sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slightly burned . It was scratchy against Grace 's skin , but she had supposedit would be ; she remembered it from strawberry picking  --  on Sunday drives , east of the city , in the wildlife preserve . Her father would put his foot up importantly on the rock wall before the gully , would stare off into space : Father , look around to me , take me into your heart ! Her mother would have to separate Grace and Bobby , who fought in the strawberry patch . She would keep her eyes , her mind , groveling along the earth  --  no coward to reality , she ! Later , Tom had driven out often . They would hit the badminton birdie back and forth , Tom cavorting and twisting , leaping up into the air , showing off to her his strong young body . Now Grace looked up with some surprise to this strange man , who stared at her with a fierce , perplexed look . She really felt no regret that he was not Tom , after all . She could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she had never felt anything , any sense that what they might do together would mean anything , that Tom 's mind could con/tain the experience , that he could understand it , value it , or that she herself could rightfully value it . " Who the hell are you ? " the man said , crouching above her . He looked as if he suspected that a joke was being played on him . " What 's the matter with you ? " Grace shook her head . He was pulling at her clothes . She did not close her eyes but kept them fixed vaguely on the point to the right of his head . When the man 's panting had subsided , Grace waited for a feeling of some sort to come to her . It had been no worse than , say , the Saturday she had had five teeth drilled , or the rabies shots after a stray dog had bitten her . That day she had lunged under the doctor 's desk , squealing , and he had crouched and chased her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mane ruffled , wild , leaned over her and stared into her face . About the pupils of his eyes , leading outward like little pencil lines , were threads of blood that seemed to express perpetual astonishment . " You never did that before , did you ? " he said . A look of queer tendernesssoftened his face , slackened his cheeks . This look struck Grace to the heart and she felt again the listless soul-shrugging inertia of one who has finished with life but not quite finished with living . " Next time it will be better , " he said . " I could n't last long this time . . . . " Grace turned away . Her stomach and loins burned , and then there came an unmistakable feeling , one associated with the bathroom at home and the rest room in her grade school : she gave in to convulsive retchings and managed to vomit something , not much , into the grass . After that she sobbed without tears , a curious dry sobbing that tried her own patience . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man had turned away out of respect for her modesty , or maybe out of distaste or disgust . Grace went to the car and took a tissue out of her purse and spat into it . She looked at herself in the mirror . Yes , just as she thought : her nose was shining with grease.  |p108Her  hair tangled , lipstick smudged , she looked hardly pretty . But at the thought of fixing herself , of luring back her old image , her hands fell sullen and useless in her lap . She wondered if her death would be anything unusual or whether it would be another , final , cliche . " I 'm driving now , " she announced . " Driving ? " said the man . He was fixing himself . " You let me do it . I 'll do it . " " No , " said Grace . " I want to . " In spite of the man 's protests , she stopped at a crossroads several miles later and picked up three hitch-hikers . They were in their early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stooped to pick up a cardboard suitcase , his nostrils widening and narrowing like those on a horse ; the next , a pot-bellied young man with a day 's growth of beard , jerked his shoulders back as if he were at attention ; the last , a surly-faced , foreignlooking , skinny boy , continued smoking his stub of a cigarette while his racing mind showed clearly in his eyes . " Get in back , " the man said importantly . The three climbed into the back seat , the biggest first , pushingone another and swearing under their breaths short oaths of astonishment . All wore old clothes , dusty and splashed with mud , and smelled of perspiration . The skinny one sat squashed in one corner and smoked his cigarette by sucking on it the way a child would suck on a straw . It was early evening . Grace turned on the headlights . In the back seat the young men muttered cautiously , whispered , occasionallypunched one another . The man beside Grace switched on the radio angrily . It must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace felt immediately that she was losing her mind , losing her control . It happened as if in a dream . Headlights eased to her , rushed past , disappeared in a flicker of red lights in the mirror.  |p109The  boys in the back seat talked loudly now , their courage bolstered by the radio . There was a scuffle . Grace heard it remotely . " Stop at that garage , at that garage , " the man muttered into her ear . " This was a mistake . " But Grace roared past the garage . In the back seat one of the boys cried out in pain . " He 's a bastard , a bastard , " someone shouted against her ear in explanation . The man beside her swore out loud . He took something out of his pocket . Grace glanced at it , saw that it was a small jackknife with a chipped plastic handle . Apparently he thought better about using it and put it away again . The music whined loudly about them . And what would they be thinking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First speculations . She said she was going . . . But she told me . . . You mean she did n't . . . ? Her curiosityended there ; nothing her mother or Tom could say could interest her , she could write their dialogue for them . Even Pat , with her pleasant , surprising wit was predictable , endlessly predictable . . . . Grace felt the car swerve a little off the road . A rough spray of gravel flew up . " Hey , hey ! " came from the back seat , and the scuffling stopped . The man gripped her arm in sudden fear but she drove faster , again swerving off the road . They were on the outskirts of the city of Derby now , approaching a slummy river-front section . Gas from refineries downriver eased to them , smothering the air . At an empty intersection the car 's tires squealed violently and , as Grace held her breath , the car skidded at an angle across the intersection and smashed into a board fence . Excitement ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , still gripping Grace , stared as if he could not believe it . " Let go ! I 'm going , " said Grace . She climbed out to the sidewalk . Despite its shiny magnificence , the car looked like a hurtp110dog , crouched up off the street before the collapsed fence . Peoplewere beginning to gather : men in shirt sleeves , Negroes ; and Negro women leaned precariously out of windows . Grace was trembling and felt again the beginning of that queer dry sob . One of the boys grabbed her arm , pulled her with him . " You coming along , honey ? " he said . The tall one with the suitcase . " I get it now . It was n't never your car . Was it ? We better get the hell out of here . " The dark man got out of the car carefully , rubbing his face . Grace was sorry to see that it was bleeding . He started for her but was stopped by someone asking questions  --  a busy-faced Negro in a suit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's get out of here , " the tall boy said , and he pulled Grace along with them , running down the sidewalk . The dark man pounded breathlessly after them , holding his face . The side windows of the saloon opened onto the river . A dark wet smell pressed in , was pushed back by the smells of the saloon and its people . Grace put her pineapple purse in the middle of the table and reached into it when it was time to pay , taking out ten-dollar bills . Sometimes she confused one man with another : sometimes with a person she knew , sometimes not , sometimes just with the dark man , who seemed to have attachedhimself to her . She heard him shouting something about " Wife ! My wife ! " to a bunch of grinning , unbelieving men . Outside the window it was night . The bar was long and greasy , and men  --  Negroes  --  sat before it , looking at them . Once Grace opened her eyes to see a fat Negro sailor leering at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys who had been hitch-hiking . The skinny one kept trying to get away , showing his teeth and growling something that Grace could not make out . There was an argument about something a few minutes later . The dark man with the scratched face ,  |p111whom  Grace had tired of seriously , was swearing at someone else , several other men who were standing around . The skinny boy leaned over the table and pushed at him . The dark man 's chair teetered , he threshed about wildly , he fell over . Laughter . Grace watched him fall but did not laugh ; her attention shifted elsewhere . A wind from outside . Night . She got up unsteadily and went to the window . Very pleasant indeed would the night air have been if it had not been corrupted by refinery smells , by a stench of rotting fish and garbage . Across the water , buildings were remote and pinpricked by light , and at the tops of their smoke stacks rings of fire gleamed against the un-healthysky . Someone took Grace gently by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back yawns , hiccups . A stairway . There was a fight behind her , a pounding of fists on tables , stampings . At the top of the stairs the men with her bellowed with rage at something . Someone crushed into her , hurting her foot . There was a shout : " He 's got a knife ! The bastard 's got a knife ! " Feet pounded up and down the stairs . A sound like that of chairs falling over came from below . She was being pulled along , pulled along . Smell of rats upstairs here  --  sharp sweet smell  --  and pounding feet and in a sudden blast of light the face of the Negro sailor , fat-cheeked and pleased , careening toward her . Raising her hand before her , she found herself eye to eye with her diamond : shorn of symbolic value , harmless light , it had not been worth taking off and throwing away . Grace could not quite remember what it was . Some time later . The room is like this : white walls , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table ( three days old , so drooping gently ) , magazines in a pile , television set in a corner , not turned on just now . The bed joined like a caterpillar to be jacked up , jacked down , with a mountain of pillows to suffocate against . From out of the mirrorp112Grace watches the girl in bed . The dark red hair is spanking clean , loose , shining like the floor . The face is clean , fresh , eyes are fresh , brow unwrinkled , hands wait quietly ; thanks to one of the nurses , she has even been able to do her nails , again the same pink color . A clock ticks on the bedside table . In opens the door . In comes the Mother , first , with a serious blinking look , a half smile , a navy blue dress with white collar Grace remembers very well ; behind her the Fiance , of a height that always did surprise Grace , and freckles suntannedinto prominence , and hair damply combed , and washand-wearblue suit  --  handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unworth , face scrubbed and neck scrubbed , wearing his Christmas suit and polka-dot snap-on tie that makes Grace want to jump out of the mirror and run and snap it against his throat . A shuffling of shoes , and they are in . " I 've just talked with that other doctor , " the Mother says softly . She touches the girl 's forehead and the girl smiles . " On the anniversary of your father 's death  --  he seemed to think that had something to do with it . I do n't believe it . I do n't believe it . " No one believes it , and they arrange themselves in chairs . The Brother sits on the window ledge , glad to be out of sight . What is there to say ? There was nothing to say the first time they visited . The girl in bed will reassume her role , Grace knows , give her but the words to do it with , the correct glances . Time can be nursed , there is all the time in the world ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another escape , another flight . An hour after regaining consciousness Grace had rejected , flatly , the ease of insanity  --  bloodless suicide , suicide for cowards . Not for her . . . . At the most , the wedding would be put off until Thanksgiving . No questions . What is there to question ? See how their love for her surges forth , protecting her , except that of Brother , who is embarrassed and thinking ofp113something else  --  maybe the newspaper stories about his sister and the picture of her  --  probably the one taken for the sorority composite ; good enough . Out of the mirror Grace watches the family scene , sees smiles , teeth , blinkings , exchange of glances , uncrossing and crossing of legs . Optimism as healthy and American as the pimples on Brother 's forehead and chin . Most of all Grace sees the girl 's clever eyes that mirror the germ of enthusiasm , shy feigned germ of love . Now the scene moves away . Slowly back , slowly into the distance . Movie screen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the last instant the girl glances to the mirror again , seeks reassurance from Grace , gets reassurance . All the time in the world , and the next time there will be no failure . In another year , perhaps . Experience is the best teacher.  |p114The  Senator , a loud red-faced friendly man , was about forty-two when he encountered Blind Boy Robin . He was no less than six feet three in his expensive shining boots , and his thick brown-red hair , sticking out on all sides , made him look even taller  --  a grinning giant of a man whom folks would turn around to look at , their faces lighting up with recognitionand pleasure . His name was B. ( for Bethlehem ) Arnold Hollis and he owned the largest farm in Tintern . He was a widowertwice and had just remarried  --  his bride was a distantp115cousin of his , a sly kittenish girl of eighteen  --  and he had lived all his life on the Hollis farm , a thousand-acre spread that gave to the world potatoes and wheat and beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns , deer or bear hunting , mountain fishing , and great meals of ham , steak , or venison , with potatoes . He was partial to the whims of his new wife , to the accomplishments of his four sons , to the opinions of his neighbors , friends , and associates , and to the look , feel , and smell of Tintern Falls on a Saturday when the farmers would come into town . Then he would drive in himself in his old pickup truck , the one with the rattling fenders that no one ever used on the farm any more , and the dust of the little main street of Tintern Falls would billow up mightily behind him . By the time he had stopped the truck and got out , usually in front of the town 's hardware store , whose owner had been his father 's best friend , or in front of the saloon , someone would already be coming up to him , shaking his hand , joining with him in a loud , explosive , familiar exchange of greetings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . That day had been right in the middle of the bean picking , and the Senator had escaped to town , leaving the place in charge of " them redneckforemen an ' a mess of women an ' the prickliest-faced niggers in Eden County . " He stood at the bar with four or five other men , farmers like himself , and exchanged comments with them on the bean season . " My niggers this year are the worst I seen yet , " he said . " The goddam bus they come on broke down in the middle of my drive , the first morning . Then there was a one of them , a boy no more'n eighteen , come up to me an ' ast about was I goin ' to fix up the cabins for them , on account of he thought they was n't clean enough . An ' could they fish down in the crick . " He stared at his drink in dismay . " Yes . He done that . An ' I swear he never blinked once all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers this year were ungrateful and troublesome . " I never made much of a noise , " one of them said , a man the Senator had known all his life , " when one of the foremen would find another baby somewhere  --  you know  --  in a irrigation ditch or somewhere . No . I did n't like it none but I never got hard on them . I yelled at them , for the look of it . But I swear this year they 're startin ' on the growin ' ones  --  There was a little boy about three , an ' a girl near about four , found kilt back in the woods . " They waited for the Senator to speak . They could tell he did n't like what he 'd heard , and he could maybe match it with something of his own  --  he hired three times as many niggers as any of them . But it turned out that they never got to hear him , because the bartender  --  who had been leaning on his elbows and listening  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here ! " They all looked around to see a Negro boy of about six or seven , probably one of the bean pickers ' kids , leading through the doorway of the saloon a boy of perhaps fourteen or fifteen , a white boy , who stared at them with great dreamy unmoving eyes . " You kids get out , I said , " the bartender shouted . The Negro boy ducked his head and ran out , with a comic pivoting movement that made the men laugh . But the white boy remained . " Listen , kid , " said the bartender , " ai n't you goin ' to do like I ask ? " The Senator turned sharply to him . " You , Curt ! " he said " Ca n't you see that there poor boy 's blind ? " " Blind ? " cried the bartender . " Blind ? " They stared at the boy . He was slender , with fine pale hair , nearly white curls that grew close about his ears and even a little down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression of having been drawn with minute , painstaking detail , with something like a very fine drawing pen . His eyes were openp117and bold with a little boy 's daring in a man 's world ; they seemed to be focused , now that the Senator had spoken , on the Senator himself . " You , boy , " the Senator said , speaking loudly and clearly , as if the boy were hard of hearing , " what bus'ness you have to do in here ? " The blind boy had been standing in a kind of pose  --  carefully balanced , with a soft-looking black felt hat in one hand and a cardboard suitcase in the other . Now that he had been addressed , he moved . He set the suitcase on the floor and bent to untie the twine that held it closed . The hat he set lightly on his head . " My name is Blind Boy Robin , " he said softly . His voice was thin and sweet as a bird 's . The Senator stepped forward , without thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other men moved , and the bartender had retreated distrustfullyto the far end of the bar . " I been on the road now , " said the boy , " since my fambly passed away of a fever . I am mournin ' a mother , a father , a big brother an ' little brother , an ' a baby sister aged two . I been brought into this town by the kindness of a man drivin ' through . " " It 's a ride you want , huh ? " the Senator said . But he did not really feel the relief he expressed , glancing back at the other men . " Well . Where 's it you want a ride to , boy ? Maybe I could help you out . " The boy had opened the suitcase . He took out a plastic harmonicaand stuck it in his shirt pocket . Then he took out a long narrow sheet of stiff paper , a sign . He stood holding it in front ofhim ; it said BLIND BOY ROBIN SEEKS RIDE ANYWHERE IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crayon , was so bad that the blind boy must have done it himself . " Anywhere in God 's world ? " the Senator said . " Why , boy , there 's a long ways of that . Ai n't there nowhere special you want ? " The boy spoke softly . " I reckon a city somewhere would bep118best , " he said . " Where I can go about my duty . But I do n't ask no favors from folks but only a ride a ways with them . I do n't ask nobody to go out of his way or to do somethin ' that ai n't good for them by and by . " " There 's a Yellow Bus line a few miles out of here , " the Senator said . He spoke quickly , as if he thought one of the other men might beat him to it . " I speck I could drive you out . There ai n't anything more than a crossroads an ' a bench the bus people put up . An ' I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased to drive you out . .. Boy , " he said , grinning , " what 's that duty you spoke of ? " The blind boy looked surprised and pleased . He took the harmonicaout of his pocket . " I mean to  --  I mean to carry the Word of love against evil , " he stammered . For a moment the men stared , and then the bartender laughed softly , as if relieved . The Senator grinned as if he had known it all along . " What 's that har-mon-ik-ka thing you got there ? " he said . " You play that ? " The boy licked his lips . Instead of replying , he put the harmonicato his lips and blew softly into it . It was a small , cheap plastic thing , little more than a toy , colored bright red . He played " Onward , Christian Soldiers " in a weak , rasping way , but was drowned out by the men 's laughter . The Senator lifted his beer glass to his grinning teeth . The boy tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of the tune was only thin air without any melody at all . " Y'know that nigger come in here this spring , " the Senator said suddenly , " that fat one that played the guitar so nice ? I took him home an ' my wife Sue Anne , why , she just giggled so an ' had such a good time listenin ' to him . She likes music , an ' different things , sort of queer people , " he said , winking at the men . The boy 's music continued weakly . " A bad thing , how the other niggers got jealous in town an ' cut him up how they did.  | . . . But Sue Anne liked it so . " The Senator broke off , staring at the boy . The boy 's eyes were closed upon the effort of his music , and his face was a little flushed , with pleasure or embarrassment . He wore a faded blue shirt that looked too big for him , and jeans with holes at the knees , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no socks . When he stopped playing , breathing hard , the Senator frowned . " Do n't stop , " he said , " that 's a purty tune . " The other men started to laugh , but stopped . The Senator did not notice but stared at the boy . " Yes , " he said slowly . " Yes . You , boy , I 'll take you for a little ride . Take you to the bus , " he said . He finished his drink . " I 'll be right pleased to help you along your way , boy , " he said . Driving out to the country , the Senator had the boy keep blowing on his harmonica . He played only one song , over and over again , and the Senator talked loud and clear over it . The boy sat with his suitcase on his lap and the queer black hat still perched lightly on his head , his thin shoulders straight and a little proud , his face solemn . The Senator talked about his wife : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' smart as anything too , an ' quick to catch on  --  Last night we were out lookin ' at the horses an ' she had some new jeans she bought in at town , an ' she showed me how she always did to get them to fit : she went an ' sat herself right down in the horse trough , splashin ' an ' squealin ' , an ' got soaked through an ' through  --  an ' then she let them get dry on her so they fit right  --  just right  --  " His explosivelaughter startled the boy 's music into silence . " Yes , sir , that 's some girl for you . That 's some girl , all right . An ' pretty , an ' smart as . . . She 'll hug me hard when she sees who I brought for  --  " The Senator stopped . He glanced at the boy but decided that the boy had not caught on . " Keep on playin ' , boy , " he said . " We got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same tune . It sounded different , however , with long , flat , ugly notes . As soon as the Senator looked at the boy the music seemed nicer  --  the boy 's delicateface , his dreamy expression , pleased the Senator . He wondered if maybe he had better not show the boy to his wife , after all . When he had brought the nigger home she had been happy and had hugged him , but the nigger was so ugly . . . . The boy was different ; he was pretty in a frail , girlish way ; he might cry to discover he had been fooled , and . . . The boy turned as if to look at the Senator . " I been on the road for years an ' years , " he said softly . He wiped the wet harmonicaon his shirt front . Behind his head a gold blur of wheat ran gleaming in the sunlight . " I do n't expect you could guess my age , mister , " the boy said . The Senator 's smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you goin ' to play no more ? " The boy smiled a little . He had fine thin lips . His smile continueduntil his lips parted and showed small , even , discolored teeth . " We 're goin ' through wheat fields , ai n't we ? " the boy said , sniffing . " Ai n't you goin ' to ask my age ? " " You play some more , boy , " the Senator said . The boy blew into the toy for a while . He began the same song in the middle , going through to the end and back again , blowing short , flat , airy notes . Something about the song made the Senator 's smile die before it could begin . " How old are you , boy ? " he said finally . " I 'm mostly eighteen . " The Senator laughed and slapped the steering wheel . " Eighteen ? " he cried . " Boy , you know you ai n't seen sixteen yet . You ai n't . I got myself a boy not fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in  --  " He hesitated . " Well , a big boy . But you ai n't no eighteen . "  |p121The  boy blew a few more notes . The Senator glanced at him as he drove on , a little puzzled . " You know , mister , " the boy said gently , " I ai n't got a pillow to lay my head on . " He spoke as if reading prepared words . " I ai n't got a pillow for my head , a home to live in , nor a fambly to love . Nor any money either . I run out of money . " The Senator stared ahead at the road . It was a dirt road and disappeared into the empty distance in a haze of yellow dust and heat waves . " That so , boy , " he said softly . " That so , mister , " said the boy . He was still blowing now and then through the harmonica . Then he quit . He put it away and pushed his suitcase carefully to one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving as before , staring at the road . A tight , cold feeling had begun in his stomach . " Mister , " said the boy , and his hand touched the Senator 's arm lightly , " you know what it is for a blind boy travelin ' the roads , summer an ' winter ? I got me a duty to preform an ' no rest from it . " His hand , his thin , strong fingers , ran up the Senator 's arm to his shoulder in a groping , caressing way . The Senatorcould feel his thin warm breath . " There 's people take it proud to offer up a little money or so to a blind boy ca n't see his way , " he said . His hand touched the Senator 's chest . The Senator was locked in a chill pulsating inertia . He had felt this before  --  he recognized the symptoms , the near paralysis , the ugly taste spreading in his mouth , the terrible clarity of his brain , which now shouted at him , Fool ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear had ripped one of his dogs nearly in two and had started for him  --  that was a time . Once he had fought another man with a knife , when he was twenty , and had seen his own blood on the man 's shirt front  --  that too was a time . And now thisp122He turned and stared into the blind boy 's eyes . They were brown and cold and flat , like the eyes in a big doll , and the Senator cried , " You ai n't no blind boy at all ! " The boy blinked as if he had been slapped . He sank back against the suitcase and pushed his hat back farther on his head . " A hell of a thing to say to a sufferin ' blind boy , " he muttered . He took a jackknife out of his jeans pocket . He pulled the blade out slowly as the Senator stared . " You drive on , mister , " he said . " Do n't you slow up for a time . I 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that was a bus corner you aimed to take me to . All right . An ' give me a little money , too , to aid me on my way . Or was it a bus I was goin ' to meet ? Or what ? What were you goin ' to do with me ? " The Senator 's armpits itched and stung and he drove on in a hollow roaring daze , driving jerkily , now pressing down on the gas pedal , now easing up . " I do n't know what you mean , " he began . " You got no right to  --  " " All right , mister , " the boy said . " Ai n't I got a right to fun like anybody else ? Like you ? You do n't understand what it is , a blind boy like me , a sufferin ' boy like me , travelin ' all these years . You do n't understand what it is to have a duty to preform . " He fingered the sharp blade before him . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got yourself a boy fourteen too . All right . He could beat me too ; all right . That 's fine . Time I was fourteen I got to know what havin ' this face I have , an ' this hair I have , could do for me . Sure . A man standin ' around the sawmill back home , he tole me I could come for a ride with him if I wanted ; he tole me he 'd be glad to on account of he had n't no boy of his own . That man give me somethin ' to drink , too , an ' he went drivin ' all this ways , so I known I could n't ever find my way home again , an ' then when I woke up I was off somewhere in a field an ' had a funny smell pouredp123on me , like perfume , an ' no clothes neither . So I known I would n't ever want to go back home again . Sure . That was then . Mister , " the boy said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senator 's throat , " you ai n't got the feelin ' for what a blind boy goes through , just travelin ' these roads in pursuitof his duty . I reckon not many have . I reckon there 's four out of five stop to give me a ride , four out of five that got in their heads what that first man did  --  an ' I can tell them kind now , the way a dog can smell another dog way off , just liftin ' his nose up in the air . I sure can , mister . But long about when I got to be seventeen , why , " he went on chattily , while the Senator drove with his heart churning within him , " I come to think I got too narrow a mind . I listened to some Christian bus'ness . Mister , I fell into the Christian bus'ness the way some folks fall in a bog , an ' I ai n't been the same since . I thought , Blind Boy Robin , travelin ' to do your duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ai n't never seen that you got yourself one hell of a bigger duty . An ' that is to rid God 's world of all kinds of sinners . " The Senator could hear himself breathing . Ahead there was nothing except more empty road , more summer haze bounded by swelling fields of wheat . " I have n't done anything , " the Senatorsaid pitifully . " I have n't hurt you . I have n't hurt anyone . If it 's money you want  --  " " It 's money I want , " the boy said , smiling . Again he was so close the Senator could feel his breath . " But that ai n't but a half of what I want . " Now the Senator 's words tumbled away from him . " I 'm known in this country for helpin ' people . I lend out land . I lend out money . I ai n't never hurt a person . I ai n't never raised a hand against a person , so help me God , I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " He was talking faster and faster . " I ai n't ever had no bad thought on you , " he stammered.  |p124The  knife blade was cool against the loose skin of his throat . The boy seemed to be playing back the Senator 's words , trying to decide . " Never had no bad thought on me ? " he said . Tears came into the Senator 's eyes . Behind his stinging vision his mind shivered and blundered and could not jerk clear . He could still hear it shouting , Fool ! Fool ! at him but nothing else , nothing else . " I ca n't tell if you 're one of them men or not , " the boy said . He spoke idly . " Mostly I can smell them out . First minute , mister . It 's a little mixed up with you . Now I got to admit that with them it 's more of a good time for me ; I feel my duty clearer . Others , them others , well , they 're there too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . But goddam it , mister , it 's no kiddin ' that it ai n't the same for me . " " I could get you some money . More than I have with me now , " the Senator said . " I do n't have much . I do n't have enough . I could get you more at  --  " The boy pressed the knife against his throat and the Senator gasped more in shock than in pain . " Hush , hush , " the boy whispered . " You drive on . Your breath ai n't that cheap nowadays . Listen , mister , " he said , " I ai n't partial to this life myself . I ai n't . A blind boy with no pillow for his head , no home to live in , no fambly to love . Just my duty an ' the road an ' the different men trapped . I ai n't partial to it , mister . I 'd give it all back an ' the ones behind me , the ones I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to make me a goddam backwoods fool like that son of yours . That 's the serious truth , mister . But I got to be true to myself . I got to be true to my duty . There 's all of us men trapped in ourselves , in our duty , an ' ca n't quit till we die . My life all strung out on roads an ' in cars an ' in them men 's faces I never get to see , my lifelong duty , mister , my specialsorrow  --  my sorrow , my dark , sweet sorrow  --  " His voice trailed off dreamily . The Senator gripped the steeringwheel in an agony of fear . He is insane , the Senatorp125thought . Down at the core of his being , deep inside past the loose nervous buzzing , he could hear the words come one by one , like a judgment pronounced not upon the boy but upon himself . " Mister , " the boy said vaguely , " if it 's how you said , you ai n't never done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  never ate off of other ones , like they want to eat off me  --  well  --  well , I reckon you are goin ' to have a special privilege for yourself . " " What is it ? " said the Senator . " Will you let me go ? Will you ? I have n't harmed anyone , never , I have n't  --  " " You 're goin ' to have the privilege of sharin ' the world 's sin then , since you got none of your own , " the boy said slowly . " Yes . Christ was pure an ' suffered for the world 's sin . Christ took it on Himself . He did that , " the boy said , turning to the Senator . " Course it never did Him no good , it kilt Him good an ' dead . It never did nobody much good . But a big fat man like you , mister , with a big fat mouth , all innocent of sin like you say , you 're goin ' to have that privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye an ' say to me , to Blind Boy Robin himself , that you do n't deserve none of this ? " The Senator 's heart jumped . It seemed to explode in him and then he was shouting , his arms were striking out . The truck swerved . The boy 's face gave way beneath his blows , the glint of the knife blade disappearing , and the Senator heard his own mad voice : " Let me alone ! Let me alone ! You know too much ! You found out too much  --  somebody tole you  --  some nigger or somebody  --  " The vision of the murderous bear returned , unaccountably , but he had an answer to that right away : I would n't mind that . Not that . I never deserved it , it was just an accident , so I would n't mind . Just a sick scared bear I never deserved . But this  --  this  --  this boyThe moment was over . The Senator sat gasping and wheezingin the truck , which had nearly run into a ditch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blind boy , who lay back against the frayed seat , his narrow chest rising and falling , his hands empty . There was nothing except the sound of their breathing . The boy gazed sightlessly out the window , his fine , delicate eyes turned inward , staring inward , out of the Senator 's knowledge . The boy 's felt hat , though , was still on his head , and he lay back against the seat , his lips parted upon a thin streak of blood and saliva , as if he were just resting . Half an hour later the Senator braked the truck to a stop . Here four dirt roads ran together out of scrawny corn fields , and there was a single rain-streaked sign that pointed one way to Tintern Falls , and the other way to Derby , a city ten miles south . There was a bench out in the open , near the sign ; and the Senator opened the door for the blind boy , leaning across him , and then helped him out and led him over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with dust in the air . The blind boy 's hand petted the bench and he sat down , putting the suitcase beside him . The Senator was stuffing some money in the boy 's shirt pocket  --  not much , a few bills . . . Though the boy 's expressionand his breath were quite normal and even serene , the Senator 's breathing was still painful , and his heart had turned tight and cold . He stumbled back to the truck and got in . He had the key turned , he had the engine going , when somethingglinted on the floor and caught his eye . He picked it up . It was the blind boy 's knife . " You , boy , " he said . He leaned across to the open window . The blind boy sat on the bench , a small , thin figure , his black hat running a shadow slyly across his eyes . He seemed to be watching the Senator . The Senator cleared his throat . When he spoke his voice was not so forceful or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your knife here , boy . Here . " He dropped it . The blind boy sat without moving , but now he began to smile . The Senator felt that smile tickle across his heart , his stomach , his being . He carried the look of it with him all the way down the dirt road , against the dizzying onslaught of heat and light and country dust , and when he tried to forget it he could not . His heart was cold and tight within him , like the part of him that had died.  |p128They  sit at the table . Suppertime , yet almost dark : so it must be winter . There are the father , the mother , the baby brother , the grandfather , and the little girl . Baby brother with shining light hair , on the mother 's lap , being fed . He eats anxiously , desperately , his little mouth gaping when the spoon is still inches away . It gapes wider and wider until it closes upon the spoon , his eyes closing too , then opening just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the little girl : a look of cunning and satisfaction . The mother wipes his mouth and chinp129with her hand . Her hand drops out of sight , no one watches but the little girl . She sees that it wipes itself , quickly , ceremoniously , on the faded apron . When the hand reappears above the table the mother is already eating . Unlike the baby brother , she does not open her mouth until the fork is immediately before it . She eats dutifully . Her face is tired , there are shallows around her eyes , her eyebrows are plucked thin , no more than pencil lines . The little girl can tell that the mother does not taste her food and that the food lies in little ground wet colorless clumps upon her tongue , waiting and waiting to be swallowed , finally swallowed down with a drink of milk . The glass is then put to the baby brother 's mouth , directly from the mother 's . He gasps and drinks and his mouth works just as if he were chewing food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewilderment . As the father sets down his glass his big arm moves in the corner of the little girl 's eyes . She has been hearing him eat ; now she looks . He picks up a piece of meat and bone and thick , yellow-tinged fat , and tears at it with his teeth . There is a sound of wetness and chewing and a strange elasticity , as if he were chewing gristle . He grimaces as he eats , the corners of his mouth dart up as if he were grinning . The girl watches him through her glasses , which have slid , as always , down a little on her nose . She watches him bite : his teeth are not even , and one of the big front ones is grayish green . She sees a little of the gums , a dark red color and wet , and a flash of his thick tongue , dartingout to a streak of grease on his hand . Muscles in his neck work . His jaws grind , his lips move . His eyes are fastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriousness , concentration , and sweat beads on his forehead . On his plate there are fried potatoes and damp rye bread and green beans and a little suetty puddle from the meat . Faint juices with tiny buds in them , globules of fat , have come out from the different kinds ofp130food and seem to link them . The father has big , staring eyes that can grow huge  --  for example , when he chased the strange black dog out of the yard , beating it with the rake  --  and his face is red and coarse , and little black dots are all over his cheeks and nose and chin . The grandfather begins talking . No one looks at him but the little girl . The grandfather is wearing overalls , she knows , but on top he has on just his old gray underwear , thick winter underwear not thick enough to disguise his shoulder bones . His throat is a marvel of loose hanging flesh and wrinkles and crisscrosses and a bump on it that jiggles and careens as he speaks . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  his brother 's death . That happened fifty years ago . No one listens except the little girl , who has heard the story many times . The grandfather talks to her across the table , his bite of food  --  maybe rye bread  --  jerking about , forgotten , on his tongue . On his plate food lies soggy , looking chewed . His hands tremble so that the little girl is afraid he will overturn his glass of milk ; he does that sometimes . " A-right duringMass it was , " the old man says , his voice getting shrill and shaky , as if he were arguing , " an ' us in the pew an ' a space there for Allen , what laid home sick . An ' the priest askin ' us to pray for the sick-of-the-parish , like they do at the end . An ' we prayed for the sick-of-the-parish and everybody prayin ' and the wind outside  --  a big March wind  --  an ' all at once a big thump ! A big thump ! An ' it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' knocked some shingles off the roof . " He leans over the table , his eyes watery and nearly blind , and they narrow and gleam and widen at her , so the little girl knows  --  sitting frozen in her place  --  how it was that day fifty years ago , in the country church , with the March wind blowing . " An ' gettin ' home Ma met us cryin ' in the lane , Allen died ! Allen died ! ' " His voice mounts to a crescendo of feverish passion , and theyp131all look at him just in time to see the glass of milk  --  a thick glass that once had store jam in it  --  tip over . " You goddam old son of a bitch of a bastard , " the father says , chewing . The girl sits near the wall of the church , next to a fat twelveyear-oldwith a red plastic purse and patent-leather shoes and no socks , or maybe stockings ; the girl ca n't tell and does n't dare lean over to look . She knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because every few minutes her plump cheek moves , just a little , very neatly and contentedly . Up there the priest is just raising his hands to heaven . His vestment has green and white and gold parts . It gleams coldly in the cold air of the church , and the singing of the women from above winds in and out of his chant . If the girl turns a little she can see her family in their pew : her father at the end with his big face oddly lit by the stained glass window ( bright red , blue , green , yellow , outlined by black ) , a blue necktie fierce and tightlookingaround his neck . The mother , in a white cotton scarf . Her face is softened . The girl peers at her through lowered lashes , hating her . That morning the mother slapped her : the girl had shouted at her brother . Fighting over the funny papers .. The fat baby , going on three , fat-stomached , fat-cheeked , ca n't read , yet pretends to read , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures and working his wet mouth . There is the baby himself , standing up . Thick in a new winter coat , navy blue sailor coat . His face looks like a balloon , his eyes little mucus-filled blue things . The girl watches the baby and her mother  --  they are so close  --  and she hates them both and wishes them dead . Next is the grandfather : he sits dozing back inside his big faded black coat , his bony throat hidden.  |p132His  face is wrinkled and white and dry , the face of death . The girl sees him as a stranger , and turns away . Beside her the fat girl , who has white fur on her coat , chews for a moment . The girl feels triumph , satisfaction . At the end of the row their teacher , Sister Ellen , sits ; maybe she will see . No gum chewing in church . The singing climbs higher . It wavers , voices waver . The girl pulls her rosary along , skipping beads down by her knees so no one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more decades to go . Then she feels shame . She goes back to where she was . Her lips move silently , praying . To make amends she says the " Our Father " twice , because it is longest and does n't fit into an easy rhythm , like the " Hail Mary , " and so takes more trouble ; she is sorry for skipping . She thinks the familiar words clearly . Up at the altar the priest turns . His face is dark , his hair dark . Older than her father . The girl once heard her father and another man talk about the priest : Beginning of Lent , fat beer belly ; end of Lent , no belly a-tall . How they laughed ! The man had a story about his own priest , in another parish , but the girl forgets it now . She watches this priest . He comes through the school sometimes , checking on classes . The bad boys have to go and see him . The bad boys joked in the coat room , but toward three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the priest the altar boys wait . The girl knows them : they are about her age , brothers . On the school bus they write bad words on the clouded windows , and unsnap spiral notebooks , and do n't wear their boots but leave them in the ditch by the road , where they get on the bus . The girl hates them and would like to stay home from school some day and go down to the corner and find their boots and throw them into the creek . Let them make up stories to explain about that ! But up at the altar , now , they look so young and content and blank . Their faces are blank . The girl , clutching her rosary , feels her heart trip . Why are their faces so blank ? And the facep133of the priest , a " black Irishman , " the grandfather had said ; why is it so blank ? Turning upward now to heaven , arms raised aloft , hands neat and pale above the gold-trimmed sleeves  --  he might be a statue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church . The girl 's favorite has always been that of the Virgin with the Child . The Virgin wears blue and white and has a halo about her head . But her face is blank , expressionless , the girl sees with growing terror , blank like the other faces , . . . and her heart is on the outside of her body ! The girl feels sick . She had stew the night before for dinner . It had pieces of meat and fat in it , floating , and cooked carrots and potatoes and celery . .. . It is nearly time . The girl skips one or two beads . Her fingers are cold and itching with sweat . She feels nauseous . The day before , waiting to enter the confessional , she felt nauseous too . An old lady was in there , deaf ; she whispered so loud  --  " I tell lies "  --  that the girl had to put her fingers to her ears , wanting to cry . She had her sins written down . There were eleven of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I disobeyed my parents . " " I forgot my morning and night prayers . " " I was mean to my brother " ) . She could think of no more . She confessedsome sins she was n't sure she had done that week ; but maybe she had . When the old woman had left , stumbling out through the curtain , the girl had stood at once with her legs like ice and a swirling feeling in her stomach . " **32;4309;TOOLONG . " But now it is nearly time . Bells ring . The girl watches in terror . The priest 's blank pleasant face , the boys ' blank faces . Smooth , warm , content , though the church itself is cold , the voices of the shrill old women in the choir are cold , cold as centuries of death . Is it possible they are going to take Communion now , are going to rise and run forward to take Communion ? The girl beside her chews once more . A quick , furtive move/ment of her jaw , then a movement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly time . Along the row small hands finick with rosaries , hurrying to the ends of decades , good places to stop . Prayer books are held up tentatively , ready to be closed . Nearly time ! Nearly time ! The bell rings again , a golden sound . The girl 's heart is pounding , her ears pounding . The statue of the Virgin Mary has its heart exposed to the sitting mob of people , to the coarse wavering strains of the women 's voices above . The girl feels her heart as if it were outside . She skips more beads , stops at the last decade . She will finish it later , later . Her hands arc wet . She wipes them on her coat . Her coat is stained in front , beside the plastic buttons ; stainedwith dirt or grease . She puts the rosary in her pocket . Oh , she will finish it later . Later . Another bell ! The girl is being drawn along . If she had a prayer book she could follow her progress , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements . Beside her , beforeher , behind her  --  her own family  --  everyone shares roles .. Their faces are simple and content and not really individual . They are all alike . Even her father 's broad face , his bulging eyes , are rather like the priest 's : secure in a role . The Lewis boys , secure in roles , are bowing their heads . Their black hair grows thick down onto their necks , but that does not matter . What is important is their dress . White cotton with puffed sleeves . No one in the church except the girl sees that their hair is long , that they have hair . The girl is terrified in her isolation . The words of the priest are magic , and the Host is alive , waiting for them . It waits to be devoured . The girl sits with her mouth open , cold inside , dry . Her eyes are fastened burninglyupon the priest , who draws her along with his words of magic in a high , solemn , whining voice , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes close , their hands fold into prayer ! Everyone kneels , . The girl kneels . Her knees arep135cold , pained . One hand grasps the other ; fingers clutch at fingers . " Have mercy on us ! " the girl thinks , but she knows her words are no good ; they are outside the magic . They are delivered outside a role . About her the mob of people move , drift , swarm , murmuring with their eyes closed , tapping their hearts with gentle knuckles . The girl does that  --  not gently ; she wants to feel her fist . When she looks up at the altar the lights there are blurred . There are tears in her eyes . It is nearly time . But there is something wrong . Then she remembers . The thought strikes her chest , pierces her heart . In her imagination everyone in church looks at her , eyes narrowing . This is because she has hated her own mother and has wished her dead , sitting right here , here in this pew . Not ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Mortal sin . She is going to make a bad Communion . Her heart hammers . There is a roaring in her ears , the swelling rapturous murmur of the mob . But it is not too late : she can turn aside , let the others pass , pretend something  --  a broken fast , a sudden headache , sickness . . . But she is standing . The fat girl beside her stands without a glance to the side . They are filing out . Sister Ellen stands with head bowed , hands clasped , in the aisle . Perhapsshe watches them secretly through her thick glasses . Perhaps she sees the shame , the horror passing so close to her . Shame ! Horror ! A bad Communion ! The girl moves along , caught in the rows of children , her own head bowed , her fingers praying , trembling . She can not feel the floor beneath her feet . She does not look up , yet knows she is approaching the Communionrail . Feet before her turn off to the sides , disappear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she kneels . She closes her eyes to keep out the fierce light . Her tongue and hands and legs are cold , as if withdrawing from her , denying her guilt and shame . She prays for help , prays to be forgiven . She confesses hating her mother , begs for forgiveness ; but she knowsp136it is no good . A bad Communion . A bad Communion . The priest approaches . The Lewis boys  --  no , they are not the Lewis boys ; they are something else  --  they approach . The priest feeds the little white Host to children at the rail . Such young children , such strangers ! Is it possible they are the girl 's classmates , no younger than she ? The girl sees blurred hands , blurred faces , out of the corner of her eye . She is feverish . She is going to vomit , and so must press her hands against her cheeks . A bad Communion . They are closer . They are almost to her ; now they are before the fat girl beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cry out , stumble back from the rail ? Will she accept the wafer on her tongue and , looking right up at the priest , spit it out ? Will she do it , saying , " Phoo ! " Then , as she leaves church , stepping out into the icy winter air , will a limb fall upon her and crush her sinful body , smash her sinful face ? But she lifts her chin , her eyes opaque , blind ; she sticks out her tongue and accepts the wafer . The altar boys , strangers , watch professionally , sincerely , alert lest the wafer fall . The wafer must not fall . She opens her mouth , her eyes shut tight . She feels the dry , tasteless wafer still on her tongue . She bows her head , waits ; she crosses herself and stands . The priest and the boys are past . They do not glance at her . She feels the wafer melting . She follows the fat girl 's bare ( or stockinged ) legs back to the pew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , lying in bed , looks up at the dark corners of the attic room and listens to the sounds of sleep and to the other noises outside , . Owls and dogsp137seem to be conversing across great distances . The dogs bark in short , high , forlorn cries . ( Her brother made a barking noise , earlier that day , when the doctor came to fix his eye . He jumped down off his father 's lap and crawled under the kitchen table . The father and the mother and the doctor all lunged for him at once . The father had an advantage , though , sitting so close . He simply dived down under the table , with a " Hey ! " and picked up the child . The doctor straightened himself again , holding on to his white cottonpad . Then , the look of surprise still behind his glasses , he made a sudden swooping motion , as if he wanted to touch the child with the little piece of cotton and so cure him  --  magic enough . The mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whimpering along with her son , had started forward . Now she stood with her arms still outstretched and her mouth open , the yellowish skin of her cheeks pulled tight and smooth . The girl noticed all this . But then the father , laughing and showing his teeth , bounced the child hard on his knees . " What a brave little boy ! " he crowed . ) Now they sleep . The girl has seen them sleeping many times . The little boy sleeps with his mouth open on his pillow , droolingsoundlessly . His metal-railed bed with the picture of the lamb on it is pushed into one corner of the parents ' bedroom , under the crucifix and the twisted dried palms from last spring . His face is smooth , soft , pale . He looks weak in sleep , as if his heart were hardly alive . As he sleeps he works his mouth and fumbles his fingers against it . His breath comes and goes , comes and goes . In the big bed sleep the mother and father . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her expression makes her look as if she is straining for outer air , cleaner air . The bedroom smells of things  --  musty clothes , food , tobacco ,  |p138dam|pness  . The mother seems to be straining away from all this , her face creased with little wrinkles ; even her closed eyes look worried , restless behind their lids . She grinds her teeth now and then . Her hair , cut too short to cover her bony throat and shoulders , is thin upon the pillow , framing her angular yet bovine face . In the house there is a photograph of her taken years ago : She is wearing a flowered play suit  --  a girl of about eighteen , leaning back in a rope swing with a luxurious air of contentmentand pride , her eyes closed upon a secret smile . For some reason , the girl thinks of this picture when she sees her mother asleep . Next to the mother , well in the middle of the bed , the father sleeps on his back , snoring hoarsely , authoritatively , as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In comes his breath ; his big whiskery throat seems to change the air itself  --  to churn it , toughen it , break it up into small violent bits . Out comes the air again , subdued by his strength , released with great pressure . Yet his face is perfectly at rest . His eyes do not move behind their lids , nor do the muscles about his mouth twitch . Probably no child sleeps with more sweet abandon , more pleasure and seriousness , than does the father , the girl thinks . A mound in the bed , his legs great twin burrows beneath the blanket . Nothing stirs uneasily , nothing twitches , the movement of his chest is poised and calm . He will lie so , surrendered to sleep , until the morning light wakes him . The girl is downstairs now , barefoot . She stands at the screen door of the kitchen and looks into the darkness , which she fears . She can see only the surface of the darkness , but she knows it is deep ; secret things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future . The girl has slipped out of herself and , if surprised by her mother , she would stare at the woman in horror : horror at herself , at her shame in appearing naked , face set to face , mask askew . She would grope about her in thep139dark of the kitchen for her other face , her role . Blind , she would grasp anything  --  an outgrown face , a ten-year-old face . What shame to her mother , what coarseness in herself ! The girl shivers . She goes out onto the porch . The night smells damp and cool . A sudden whining sound : the dog under the porch . He crawls out on his belly , whimpering softly , gently . He peers up at her . Recognizing her , he sighs ; his head drops out of sight . The girl listens for the sound of her grandfather 's coughing , coming from his room in the old shed . They cleaned out the shed for him , but it is still dirty . She hears nothing . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there might be something there  --  insects , worms , night crawlers , like the ones boys sold to fishermen . Instead she stands for a while without moving . She can hear the dog settling itself back to sleep , its thin breath whistling with relief . " She wants to suffocate me . She wants to drown me . Her love is so fierce for all of us that Jimmy and I run down to the crick together . We just run down ; we do n't talk . We sit on the bank behind the bushes and do n't talk . What could I talk about to him ? " The girl is nervous and contemptuous . She sits at the schoolroom desk , her thin fingers sliding in and out of one another . " She hates me for having a mind different than hers . But she loves me , she cherishes me ! . . . She does n't drink milk any more , to save money  --  she says she has hers in the morning . But she really does n't want us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she does n't even know it should be secret . She does n't know how she gives herself . She does n't even know it ! " The schoolteacher sits at his desk . He is a thin , short , baldp140man with yellowish skin . He wears glasses ; without them he would hardly look serious , professional , or worthy of notice . And little children sometimes whisper to their mothers , " Is that a schoolteacher ? " It is late afternoon , and he and the girl have been working on the school " news "  --  a column that is usually filled with listings of names and runs in the weekly town newspaper . From time to time , under the headline TINTERN HIGH NEWS , the girl 's name itself is printed for all to see . She speaks of it to no one , is absurdly nervous and proud about it . But really the girl detests herself . Even now she is thinking of how she looks ; her mind always whirls about and concentrateson herself . She is too tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts it short herself , as if out of spite . Her face is rather like her mother 's : angular , with a firm chin . Her skin is poor , sometimes speckled with red blemishes . She is continuallytouching herself , as if in disbelief ; even now she feels a cluster of tiny hard pimples on her cheeks . Her eyes are large and pretty , but she squints behind her glasses , wrinkles her forehead ; in any mirror her eyes evade themselves . She thinks of her body with inward spasms of humorless laughter . It is thin and underdeveloped . Her chest is fiat , her waist dissolves imperceptiblyinto her hips . Her legs are too long , and she regards them with fascinated disgust ; there are black , wavy hairs on them . Her feet are large and square . Or maybe just her shoes : thick , unattractive brown loafers , worn without socks . It is the fashion in the high school to wear white wool socks , girls and boys alike . She would like to run at her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin ? Why am I so ugly ? To her mother 's despair , she would continue : Because you drank all the milk when I was little ! Drank it all ! There was none left for me to grow on ! " On Saturdays when we come into town she always asks ifp141there are n't some girls I would like to visit , " the girl says . She sits in the first row , before the teacher 's desk , with her legs outstretchedin the aisle . The teacher , who listens sadly , patiently , takes out a pack of cigarettes and offers it to her . The girl leans over and takes one . They both smoke . The languid air carries the smoke to the opened window . Outside there is a brief dippingexpanse of dried lawn , then the street . If someone looked at the school from the street he would see an old red brick building , three stories high , with UNION SCHOOL 1895 on top . The school looks deserted , maybe abandoned . Everyone has left today but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call " old maid " and whose car was covered with wax scrawls on Halloween : obscene words , scatological words , the teacher 's long Polish name mixed up with them . " She wants me to be happy , " the girl says . " She prays for me , I know . She prays at night , with her eyes wide open . She saw me last Sundaymorning , over in the store ; one of the kids told me so . That 's where I go and wait for Mass to get over with . They go to early Mass  --  seven o'clock . I always go to ten o'clock , and wait over in the store looking at the magazines . But she saw me once . But she never said anything , " the girl says . " She would like me to die so she could keep me , so I could n't grow up . They want to possess me  --  all of them ! Everyone in a family , whining , Think of me ! Look at me ! Here I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am here , I am alive , breathing , hungry , happy , unhappy , dirty , coughing , sick ! Do n't go off and think by yourself , when I am here ! ' " The man rubs his eyes behind his glasses . The girl sees that he is tired , old ; perhaps fifty . Why does he sit without speaking ? she wonders . Is it because he is alone , because he has no family to which he must constantly explain himself , on which he can expend himself ? Is it because he knows something  --  a secret ?  |p142But  the girl sees only his familiar person when he looks at her again , the face she can never summon to mind without an attendantvision of the streaked blackboard behind him . " You 'll be leaving Tintern next fall , " he says . " I ca n't be sure of that ! " the girl says , swallowing suddenly , looking away . " You 'll be leaving , " he says . " You 'll be awarded a scholarship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were a rule of grammar . His certainty makes the girl anxious , awkward . They have come near to abandoning their respectiveroles , yet never have they completely abandoned them . In class , once , the teacher asked about the meaning of a poem , one of Shakespeare 's sonnets , and the girl responded quickly , flushed with excitement . About her the students dozed , whispered , scribbled in their books , or stared at her and the teacher with bold , contemptuous eyes . Isolated in their rapport , in their understanding , the girl and the teacher talked as if alone , and yet formally , ceremoniously , cherishing each moment . That had been a time , perhaps the closest time . But never have they really renounced their roles , and the thought of revealing herself to him as a young woman , as a person , a creature apart from school , apart even from family affairs , addressing a man , not her teacher , really frightens the girl . She flicks ashes from her cigarette . Because the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skips with ease back to something else . She says hatefully : " Other girls ! Visit other girls ! She must know how I despise them , how I have n't a friend here . And how ugly I am ; who would like me ? I know I 'm ugly , " she says , as if the man were about to interrupt . " They 're filthy . The boys are filthy . Big farm boys . And the girls  --  " She rubs her cheek again . At the back of her mind , hidden like the religiousmedal she still wears , is the thought that she is really not ugly , but instead attractive  --  almost pretty . But she will notp143give in , she will not wear powder , wear lipstick , wash her hair more than once a week . She will not smile at the boys , she will not whisper and giggle with the girls , indulge in mutual flattery . They are children . " But what filthy children ! " she says . Her face is twisted with disgust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor of the bus station rest room . Half-empty Coke bottles . Do you know what they use them for ? The nice little girls in your classes ? " The grandfather sits in his chair , dressed for Sunday in an old brown suit , a maroon sweater , a twist of yellowish collar showing to prove he wears a shirt . His bony old chest coughs and shakes , and his hands lie idle on his knees . You would think he might jerk them up in surprise , in horror , at exposing himself so ! But he does not . It is obvious that he is absorbed in the thought of coughing , coughing up phlegm ; he has no time for anything else . He does not even seem proud that he has forced time to stop for him : Everyone knows that he has not aged for ten years ; he remains exactly the same  --  his face , even his expression , exactly the same . If anything has changed it is his eyes , which have probably weakened since last fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloping sofa beside the young man , believes that her grandfather does not really see her  --  he does not recognize her . Her mother is just coming back to the living room ; she is middle-aged . She is wiping her hands on the skirt of her dress without thinking . Realizing suddenly what she is doing , she stops ; her hands come away in shame . Of course they are not soiled ; they are not even damp . The girl stares towardthe kitchen , wishing she could force the young man 's eyes , too , in that direction.  | " He 's resting now , " her mother says . She smiles vaguely at the young man . " I got to find Jimmy . Then we 'll be off . " She goes to the kitchen door . She calls , " Jimmy ! Jimmy ! " in a weary yet relentless voice . It is a surprising voice , coming from so thin a woman . The girl 's face is flushed with excitement , turmoil . She can not stop shivering . Beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , a long , fair , serious face  --  an almost handsomeface . But his features look somehow mismatched and distracted . He gives the impression of wanting to apologize for something , but not knowing what it is . The draft from the kitchen touches them , and the girl shivers again . In the kitchen her mother closes the door and comes back . From somewhere a small black pillbox hat appears in her hand . " We 'll be back in an hour , " she says . " He 's resting now . He 'll sleep all morning . " She gropes about her head , adjusting the hat . " We are so grateful to you for driving her home , " she cries out suddenly , looking at the young man . All eyes shift away in embarrassment . The mother turns abruptly , the back door flies open , and the boy runs in . He is wearing a man 's jacket . His head is bare . He comes blinking into the living room , as tall as his mother . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her critical but affectionate attentions . " It do n't take me but a minute , " he says . He goes back to his room . Now the grandfather stands , ceremoniously , as if his name had been called . The mother comes to button him into his overcoat . Her brown purse , hanging by its strap from her arm , is awkward and gets in her way . The grandfather stands passively , indifferently , rather surprisingly tall . His shriveled face is without muscle or control and waits to explode into a wracking series of coughs .. The boy runs back , his hair wet , darker . A few drops of water dot his forehead . In the clear morning light his face is a little blemished , but his eyes are clear , alert , remind/ing the girl of her own eyes . In one hand he holds his prayer hook . When they are alone the girl and the young man turn awkwardlyto each other . There is a smell of death , of course , in the room . The smell has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lies sluggish , drowsing , in corners , behindchairs . It comes from the big bedroom , where the father lies dying , brought home to die . The girl wept to see him : his stomach bloated , his face and throat thin , wrinkled , his eyes staring out at them in perpetual astonishment : What has happened to me ? What has happened to me ? Driving home with the young man , the girl had tried to remember her father , tried to anticipate him . Her mind was confused . " He took me places when I was younger  --  once to a stock-car race . He bought me a hot dog there . There were some of his friends  --  ' Like father , like daughter , ' they said , I do n't know why . We were n't alike . I did n't know him . My childhood was taken up with my trying to know myself . So I knew no one . I think I loved him , " she had said to the young man . The young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wrinkles . He has a habit of squintingas he listens . The evening the girl met him , at a basement party in a building fringing the university area , he told her in detail about his experience in the Army , his nervous breakdown . He spoke rapidly and anxiously , staring at her , perhaps daring her to be ashamed . Now they look at each other keenly , almost harshly , in the silence of the old house . The breathless choking of the grandfather still haunts the air , the moaning last night from the bedroom , the footsteps , the running water  --  all haunt the air about them . The girl had lain upstairs in her old bed , crying , her face convulsed with pain . At dawn she woke with the musty covers tumbled about her , her neck stiff ,  |p146eyes  sore . The cold light illuminated the room , the familiar small room , and for a moment she forgot what she was , who she was , how old she was . The young man takes her in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with the odor of suffering , the sight of astonishedeyes . These eyes beg for release , for understanding  --  perhaps for someone to take on their pain , to switch places with them . Why is it me and no one else ? the eyes ask furiously .. Why me and not you ? The young man understands the eyes , but he has said nothing . For his refusal to soften her suffering , for his silent contemplation of the reality of her father 's condition , the girl is grateful ; she is both weakened and strengthened . She turns to him suddenly . She feels his hard hands , his arms . They freeze together . Their faces are blurred , indistinct , their breaths touch and merge and part . He urges her down . Her eyes close . She sees a little girl , a pale , thin-faced little girl with astonished , ashamed eyes ; she sees her mother , her grandfather , her father  --  all staring in amazement at her , trying to call her back , claim her , transform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cry , this is not you ! You are someone else !  |p147Shell  was eighteen just the day before his unlucky race with Jan . He stood a proud five feet ten inches , weighed a hundred sixty pounds  --  all dressed , that is , wearing his boots  --  on the scales in front of the drugstore , and drove a motorcycle with a white fur seat . He was known up and down the highway but thought nothing of that  --  they had heard of him , Shell , when he was fifteen ; the older guys had known him back as far as that . " He 's got blood there , " guys would say , two years ago , even , when he was only a kid . " He 's got blood inp148him "  --  so they had yelled , cheering , his own friends now , when he had beaten out every other cyclist the Sunday before at the Eden Crick turkey run . Driving up to Jan 's , Shell had sung in the wind . He had sucked in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motorcycle and not once looking back at his two friends , who must have stayed behind him on purpose , watching him , maybe imitating the way he drove with his head tilted a little back , so , his hair shooting out straight in the wind . Shell could picture himself : his shoulders looking big , muscular , under the khaki jacket , his hands clumsy and strong in the thick cottongloves , grasping the handles , Shell with the sailor 's cap , streaked with dirt and oil , pulled down tight over his forehead , so he had to tilt his head back slightly to look at the road . His eyes were hidden by the merciless gleam of sunglasses , so that he looked impersonal , secret , and vaguely threatening  --  he pictured himself so , and indeed had just been looking at himself in the candy-machine mirror back at the garage . The Sunday before , everyone had watched him : getting off the motorcycle slowly , his jeans tight about his legs and hips , his feet big in the grease-stained old boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends crowded around him , and girls too , and others just comingthrough the tall grass to congratulate him . " You drew blood there , " one of the guys shouted , and Shell felt the words make him hot , dizzy , blind . " That old guy with the bald head . He never got past them rocks . " On their way to Jan 's , on the narrow road , Shell had been struck as always by a queer sensation of falling , of being drawn toward something ; and the proud vision of himself had vanished . He and the boys had followed the winding road for a mile or two out of town , through farmland and woods ; they had smelled burned grass in the air , and the clear hot smell of sunlightitself . But after a while the woods had given way , the fieldsp149had given way , and their eyes were assaulted by the great sweep of Jan 's land , as far as the eye could dart , an incredible expanse of what looked like reflections at first , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old automobiles and trucks with something like the swift , clean stroke of a surgicalinstrument . These cars and trucks were not in rows but were simply set down at random in the wild grass . Some of them had human looks , Shell thought , with doors swung open like arms , or torn off completely ; cars lying still on their sides with the dustcoveredgrease of the undersides showing , like something indecent . In the hot sunlight the windows were winking at Shell , and the twisted metal had a look of tenseness , of rigidity , like muscles braced against something . And the cars were nearly all the same color : a dirty rain-washed gray . " Old Jan ! " Shell had suddenly said aloud . He felt an unaccountable surge of anger , of frustration . " Goddam junk yard  --  " Here and there bright pools of oil stretched between the cars , and rubbish burned in piles , smoke rising slowly as if through water . This smoke Shell could almost taste . It had been in the air for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his mouth . The smell made him angry and he felt his legs and arms begin to twitch as he slowed to turn into the drive . " A goddam junk yard here ! " he had yelled back to Nick and Tony . Jan always emerged in Shell 's mind out of the smell of dust and oil and perpetually burning rubber . He was a big old man , over six feet tall , with thick filthy arms like hacked wood , angular and bursting with strength . His head he carried high and tilted as any game cock 's , and his hair , grown gray and wispy , moved softly about his head like a cloud . His working clothes , matted and dirty and shapeless about him , looked like parts of his body , grown to him , stiff with grease . Thatp150spring he had dragged the sick-looking strip of land on the far side of the junk yard to plant corn , using a borrowed horse and plow . Going by on the road , people had watched him silently  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the same ponderous , indifferent strength , eyes closed dreamily against the white , hot haze . Saturdays in town they would see him , dressed up in a black suit coat with leather patches sewed on the elbows , tight across his shoulders , opening pompously upon his big stomach . His young wife would be at his side , walkingas if she were in a parade  --  a back-country girl said to be his cousin , or maybe his niece , with streaked hair and a broad , flat , satisfied look , a look that made men watch her . She would always stop and pull Jan to a stop before the mirror on the scales in front of the drugstore , and lick her lips , and stare seriously at herself in the mirror , the only time she looked seriousat all . Later on in the afternoon , down at the saloon , or out by the fair grounds where the motorcyclists gathered , everyonewould hear Jan 's voice  --  slow and easy in its strength , its expansiveness . " It was on Cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jan would say , evoking in his listeners looks of calculation , of admiration , ending arguments with his blank pitiless stare , with the edge of humor that threatened them more surely than his anger . Shell and the other guys had come over to poke around the junk and to drive on Jan 's track . Each time Shell had seen Jan this summer the older man 's importance had dwindled a little , to Shell , and now Shell made no pretense of hiding his contempt . Stopping to comb his hair , peering in the motorcycle 's mirror at his blemished face  --  he stiffened a little when he saw it , for the sunlight was too clear  --  Shell was conscious of the old man 's contempt for him as well , as if it were this and nothingelse that drew them together . Shell drew out the ritual of combing his hair ; he sucked at his lip with deliberation . Hep151lifted his left hand slowly , his arm in the thick khaki sleeve bending clumsily , deliberately , to shape his hair on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick front lock , heavy and dull with grease . Then he wiped the comb on his thigh and took up the dirty sailor 's cap again ; and again , slowly , ceremoniously , peering all the while into the mirror , he replaced it on his head and pulled it down over his brow . Shell shivered with excitement ; he did not know why . " Yah , it do n't matter what you say , " Jan muttered . His expressionmust have been funny because they all laughed  --  the four or five older men who stood around the edge of the track . For a moment Shell felt isolated by their laughter . Then he turned slowly and glanced at his friends  --  Nick and Tony , like him sitting on their motorcycles . They grinned back encouragingly , and he felt all right . " A old man like you should n't talk so much , " Shell said . He peered at himself thoughtfully in his mirror . " He ai n't got just that much time left to breathe in . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . He felt good . The shiver of excitementreturned , and he had a vision , in just that instant , of striking old Jan with his bare fists , his fingers , nails , digging at the man 's face  --  he had a vision of setting fire to all of Jan 's land , his junked cars , trucks , motorcycles , the squat little shanty in the middle , even . . . Shell put the comb into his pocket . He turned slowly , luxuriously . He felt good . He felt he could see himself in the other men 's eyes : younger than they were , stronger , healthier . He leaned back in the fur seat and pulled his sailor 's cap a little farther down on his forehead . He was conscious of entering into the ritual once more  --  of giving in to , indeed bringing about , the dialogue between himself and old Jan that had started at the beginning of the summer , when he had won his first real race . Beforethat , in the years before that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had felt something in the old man 's behavior that was peculiar  --  peculiarly harsh , even for Jan  --  as if the man was singling Shell out for something . When he was just a kid he and the other guys would stand in the high burnt grass at the edge of tracks , listening to Jan or other men arguing about racing , recalling races , victories , deaths .. . . . It seemed to Shell that they had stood there , so , on the edge of tracks for years , listening and watching ; and visions of these old men and discoveredfinally that they had no concern for these men , no care at all , except maybe an irritable impatience to be rid of them , an impatience for them to die . " Yah , " Jan said almost pleasantly , " I 'll be breathin ' when your blood runs along the track , you wait an ' see . I 'll walk acrost your blood in the dirt . You wait for that , kid . " Shell did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other men  --  the old men of forty or so , in farm clothes , dirty , shapeless , without identity  --  holding their faces tight , ready to smile or laugh out loud . " I 'll wait for it , " Shell said . " You do n't have anybody good to go against any more , " Jan said . He had a short piece of copper wire wound around his fingers ; he pointed at Shell with it . " Not a one of you . If you 'd been around here when I  --  when I was  --  " Shell and the boys hooted with laughter . One of them , Nick or Tony , began pounding on the seat of his motorcycle . " That 's what I come to hear ! " Shell cried . " Old Jan ! Goddam old Jan ! I speck your wife 'd like to hear that too , she ai n't heard it much these last years ! " He saw the men finally give in and begin smiling . He saw Jan 's eyes narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . How come she ai n't out here ? What 's she Join ' ? " When Jan did not answer , Shell went on excitedly , " How come she ai n't here ? She ai n't even seen this-here thingmajig Ip153bought for the handle here , " he said , caressing the white fur ornament , a thing the shape of a giant rabbit 's foot . Caressing the fur , glancing around toward the little shanty , he felt another surge of excitement . Then he gave in to his excitement , chantingbreathlessly and mindlessly : " May ! You , May ! May ! May ! You come on out ! You come on out an ' listen to goddam old Jan an ' his junk yard ! How he ust to race ! May  --  " The other boys joined in , pounding at the seats of their motorcycles . " You leave off that noise , " Jan said . Shell stopped . He was wet with perspiration . The khaki jacket was too hot , now that he was no longer on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . He grinned and wiped his forehead . " It might be I got to show you somethin ' myself one of these days , " Jan said . " It might be there ai n't nobody your own age to do it to you . " Shell laughed . " Old Jan an ' his junk yard , " he said . " It might be you just do n't know enough about the world and what it does to you , " Jan said . Shell hesitated ; he felt confused , then angry . " Ah , hell , " he - said . " How would you know yourself ? A goddam big lot of talk . How would you know ? You never go anywheres yourself . You always stay here . What do you think , this is the middle of the world ? This place here  --  " He looked around with what was meant to be an expression of careless , enveloping contempt , taking in the whole of the lot , the whole of the country , perhaps . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He was leaning forward now , tense and excited ; and when he thought of how he must look he relaxed . He sat back and laughed . " Stick to one place all your life like a goddam grazin ' cow , " he said . He thought that was good . " I know all I need to know , " Jan said quietly . " I meet all the people there is to meet . Why , I been drivin ' since I  --  " But here Jan too caught himself . He went on sarcastically , " There 's al/ways a young kid like you , thinks he knows everything , gets himselfsomething like this-here  --  " He kicked the front wheel of Shell 's motorcycle . " You get yourself one of these an ' think that buys you everything . Well  --  you come to the right place if you want to learn about . . . " " Do n't you kick this ! " Shell said . " What ? " " You heard me ! " Jan looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ai n't got nothin ' in this whole place as good as this . This place ! I ought to come here some night , you an ' your wife asleep snorin ' , an ' get me a big thing of gasoline an ' spill it half acrost an acre ! I ought to ! An ' then take a match an ' let it go ! Fire it up ! Fire up Jan 's goddam old junk field ! That 's what I ought to do , you old  --  goddam old  --  " Shell 's words ran out . But the excitement of the moment stayed static , loud in the air about them . Shell understood somethingof his own threat when he saw the beginning of fear in Jan 's eyes . Jan looked at him , twisting the piece of copper wire slowly around his dirty fingers ; no one spoke . Then there was movement somewhere  --  coming across the field  --  and they saw Jan 's wife crossing , a bright splash of color against the burnt field and the fog of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , May ! " he shouted . " Hey ! You look here , look what I got for myself ! " May 's big grin seemed to come on ahead of her . She wore a bright blue scarf loosely about her hair , and her blond streaked hair glinted in and out of the sunlight . " I heard you all talkin ' out here , " she said . " I heard your voices all the way back home . " She was looking at Shell . " What 's that ? " she said . " Is that a new thing ? Well , look at that  --  ai n't it pretty  --  " She laughed ; Shell grinned foolishly . She stepped delicatelyp155through the high grass , self-consciously , still laughing , and came to Shell 's side and poked at the fur piece with her finger . " I seen one of these things before , on a car antenna . I always thought it was the prettiest thing . " " We got to listen to old Jan again , " Shell said boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We got to listen to how he beat off everybody , sixty years ago when he was a kid ! We got to listen to how he  --  " May laughed again . She ran her finger around the rustfleckededge of the motorcycle mirror . " He ai n't at that again , is he ? " she said . " Acts like he 's got somethin ' good as this out in all that junk , " Shell said . May looked around at Jan . " Now , do n't you say that . You know it ai n't true . Do n't you go an ' say anything . You know how much Shell paid for this . " " For that ? What do I care ? " " It beats anything you got here , " Shell said . " This old junk yard ! You expect you can talk to me , me , when all you own for yourself is junk ! " " I got one good cycle here , " Jan said slowly . " It ai n't new but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is it ? " " It ust to belong to a guy drove a regular racer , too ; he had to quit an ' let me have it ! " " Where is it ? Let 's see it ! " " You mean that old thing ? " May said . " That old thing you had out here the other day ? Is that what you 're talkin ' about now ? " " You be quiet . " " Is that it ? That thing you give him fifty dollars for , like a regular fool ? "  | " You be quiet ! " " Like a regular fool  --  " " You be quiet ! " May stepped back , her arm still outstretched , her forefinger still touching the top of the mirror . They saw , after a moment , that she was smiling again , tightly , that she was glancing now and then at her reflection in the mirror . " You do n't need to get so loud , " Shell said . He pulled the sailor 's cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and put it on again so low on his forehead that he had to tilt his head back to look at Jan . Then he twisted his identification bracelet around , back and forth on his wrist . " Do n't need to go all crazy over some motorcycleyou prob'ly ai n't even got . I wonder you would n't  --  " He looked at May . " You , too , I wonder you would n't go all crazy , stuck here in a place like this . Why , you do n't even know what they 're makin ' any more  --  an ' all you got here is old junk , old tires an ' parts  --  You do n't own a thing close to what I got ! " Jan began smiling . His grin took on a harsh and indecent look . Shell , under the impact of that look , suddenly got off his motorcycle and walked around it . He kicked at the dust on the track . Some dirt came up onto his pant leg , and he kicked angrily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this goddam cemetery you come to die in ! Well , I got more than this ! I got more than you ! It do n't even matter what you think  --  here  --  Because this is only here . Where do you ever go ? What do you ever see ? All you do is stay here , this little place , this little  --  " " What are you sayin ' ? " " This little world here ! " He was still kicking at the track . When he looked around at Jan the old man 's face seemed all angles and sharp , clear planes , as though his features had been struck out of rock . " This little world . " Still Jan looked at him , smiling coarsely , and the other men ,  |p157and  Nicky and Tony , and May too , all watched him . Shell felt blinded and dizzy by their attention . " I mean to go a far way from here ! " he said . He began talking faster and faster . " I ai n't stayin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No place is ever diffrent , " Jan said . " No . " Shell began circling Jan slowly , self-consciously , aware that he might look a little ridiculous . He shook his head . " No . You got to go somewhere . You got to do something . " " What ? " " You got to do something with yourself ! " They waited ; May was staring at him . " But you do a lot of things right now , Shell , " she said . " What are you talkin ' about ? Do you know what he 's talkin ' about ? " " This ai n't enough , " Shell said . " This place here , this ai n't enough for me ! " " Do you know what he 's talkin ' about ? " Shell stopped to look at her . " There 's all kinds of places you ai n't seen yet , or I ai n't  --  there 's all kinds of things we ai n't done . We ai n't even thought of ! If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to laugh . Shell was gripped with anger again , with an anger verging on madness . " You shut up ! You keep out of this ! I only come over here today to show you this , to show you I got somethin ' better than you ! I did ! What the hell do I care about you ? I never wanted your opinion on it  --  I never asked it  --  I never asked it once , all the time I been here today ! Did I ? Did I ? Or any time since I got this-here motorcycle ! Did I ? Never once ! Now you know it , now I tole you , now I 'm goin ' . This cheap little dump , a place to crawl an ' die in , I ai n't ever comin ' back here again  --  " He jerked his head suddenly , slappingat his cheek , at a fly about to alight on his face . " An ' you know what I 'm goin ' to do ? You know what ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep right on an ' on as fast as I can , right out of here and this whole land  --  this whole time  --  I ai n't ever comin ' back ! " " Where are you goin ' ? " " I ai n't ever comin ' back ! " Shell shouted . " I ai n't ever goin ' to see you again ! A goddam place like this to die in , an ' the world goin ' on an ' on out away from it , on all sides , in all ways ! Out to the edge of the world ! A windy place ! A wild place ! " Shell fell into the somehow comforting familiarity of chanting , as he twisted the tarnished bracelet around his wrist . This was the way they urged drivers on at the tracks , or joked with each other , their voices falling into short low breathless phrases , the words themselves meaningless , only the gesture itself important . " Out far away from here ! This goddam cemetery to die in  --  ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn it all up , up to the sky ! An ' you in it  --  you in it cryin '  --  cryin ' for me to stop ! " He fell quiet . No one spoke . Then Jan said slowly , slyly , " But anywhere you go ai n't no diffrent than here . Do n't you know that ? " Shell looked at him . He was panting with excitement ; his face was covered with sweat . Jan went on expansively , his big hands caught in his straining belt , " That 's how this-here world was put together . It ai n't no diffrent , one side or another ; an ' there ai n't no edge to it , neither , but only one side that keeps on goin ' around . An ' the people  --  Why , the people might look a little diffrent , maybe , but they 're the same ones  --  the same people . . . They just act like they do n't know you , but they 're all the same . You act like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without thinkin ' . Yet it 's all the same , it never changes , it keeps the same in spite of you . " Shell felt he could not understand . The sunlight buzzed andp159throbbed at him . In the middle of it Jan watched him with brown eyes , eyes the color of earth , dirt ; and his face , the color of hardened earth too , seemed posed flatly and blindly and permanentlyat Shell . " You lyin ' old bastard , " Shell said . One of the men slapped at his arm . " These flies here , " he said . " They 're bitin ' like skeeters today . " " Must be goin ' to rain . " " What ? Goin ' to rain ? There ai n't any clouds at all . " One of the men coughed . " I do n't care , it feels like rain anyhow . Just the wind , how it is  --  it feels so hot , it feels so heavy  --  " " You shut up ! " Shell cried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he met their eyes in alarm ; then his face changed again , he felt it change . " Or I do n't care . Talk all you want . I 'm gettin ' out of here anyway . " Jan stepped over to him . One minute he stood a few feet away , so heavy , so solid that he might never be able to move , even ; the next minute his big dirty boot was right next to Shell 's . " Just a minute , " he said . " You ai n't leavin ' yet . " Shell faced him . " The hell I ai n't , " he said . He waited for the moment to assess itself , for his friends to shout approval or to say , " You drew blood there , Shell ! " But no one spoke . The way Jan looked at him , a person could tell he had control of the silenceas well as of whatever was said . Finally he said , " You do n't mean to leave without me teachin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A lesson in drivin ' . " " You ca n't teach me anything , " Shell said . " Are you afraid ? " The old man , with the copper wire still twisted jaggedly about his fingers , pointed at Shell , smiling a little.  | " I ai n't afraid of anybody , " Shell said . " You get on that motorcycle then , an ' wait till I bring mine around . " " You think so ! " Shell cried pointlessly . He looked around at the others and laughed suddenly . He began pounding the palm of one hand with the fist of the other . " Did you hear that ? " he said . " Did you hear how crazy he 's got now ? " May put her hand to her mouth . " It must be the heat drove him crazy , " he said . " You ai n't leavin ' without this , " Jan said . His glance flicked from Shell 's face to May 's . " What are you laughin ' at ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house ! " " I guess I can stay here . " " You go on . " " I guess I can stay here , watch you make a fool of yourself . I ai n't seen that for a while lately . " " And I 'll bet anything you want ! You just name it to me ! " Jan said suddenly . He pointed at Shell again ; Shell could see the jagged wire trembling . " I 'll put it up against nothin ' from you  --  you do n't need a thing to back it up . " " I got some money , " Shell said . His words came in a rush , as if he had at last discovered a point about which he could argue . " You say how much . You say it . " They faced each other , a few feet apart . " I do n't want anything of yours , " Jan said . " All I want is to show you somethin ' . But you , you name it  --  You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking his palm , laughing a brief , humorless laugh . He looked around  --  at his friends who stood waiting and eager , oddly silent , their expressions exactly alike , at the older men with their looks of savage contentment , at May , at Jan himself . Then he looked away ; his gaze dropped . " No . I do n't want anything either . I 'm as much a man as you . " " I 'm waitin ' . "  | " I said no . I said nothin ' . " " Come on . " Jan 's chest swelled ; his voice came deeper , calmer . " Come on , I 'm waitin ' . You name it . " " No . " " I said you name it . " " No . " " Come on . " " No  --  nothin '  --  " " Say her . Come on . " She 's gaze jerked back up . " Would n't you like that ! " he said . " Come on . Say it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So you could kill me ! " " Come on . Come on . " Shell shook his head . " No . I ai n't sayin ' a word . You go get that old thing an ' I 'll race you for nothin ' , . I will . You need n't get all crazy over it . " Jan seemed pleased with something . " I spose you do think I 'm crazy , " he said . " All right . All right , you stay here . Three times around this track , then , three times  --  " " Three times ! " Shell cried . " An ' then see who 's faster ! " Jan had turned ; he now hesitated . He looked around . " Faster ? " he said . " See who 's faster ? Why , did you spose the race was for that ? " Shell blinked at him . One of the men ducked his head suddenly , as if he did not want to show his laughter . " Ai n't you smarter'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing his grayteeth , a big man with a thick , muscular neck , with a proud set to his head , a proud hard smile  --  not an old man , really , Shell saw , but a man who had always looked as he did , stood as he did , a man who had never been any younger , had never caredp162to be younger  --  a man who had waited for Shell , standing just so , for years . Shell felt the heat vibrate and throb about him . " A big man like you , " Jan said , " ai n't you smarter'n that ? " Jan turned and crossed through the field . Shell felt dizzy , uncertain , he could not understand Jan 's words or the looks of the men who watched him . " Three times around ! " he said loudly , his mind jerking back to that phrase . " You come on ! I 'm waitin ' here ! Crazy old  --  Must be crazy , gone crazy with the sun an ' that-there smell around here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had just remembered it . He pushed May aside . " You stand off an ' watch , " he said . He spoke furiously . " Wanted me to bet with him ! Well , I ai n't goin ' to ! I ai n't goin ' to bet a thing , or say a word , he could use to get mad on  --  I heard some of the things he done already , over that . " " You 're not afraid of him ? " May said . " I ai n't afraid of anybody , " he said . " I do n't care how it would hurt to die ; I just do n't want to get kilt now . I want to keep on drivin ' for a while , I want to go somewheres and do things , you know , I want to go around tracks like this with guys  --  That 's what I want , that 's all I want , I do n't want to get kilt here , to have it all end here , nothin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to  --  Only he could never do it , " Shell said abruptly . " He could never kill me . " He looked at May . Then he looked at Nick and Tony . But they did not share any expression with him , any common thought . Shell looked past them to the shanty , to Jan beside it , bent over something , working with something that gleamed ; and in that same instant he believed he could see himself as he must look to these people , his queer narrowed look , his frightened silence , channeledtoward their indifferent curiosity out of the whole day  --  the whole vista of wind , and heat , and dust , and the smell of burning rubber  --  a communication to them of other days theyp163had seen , surely , in other summers , days such as this with the burning odor in the air and the sunlight pressing down against one 's chest like a weight , or an opened hand ; with the backs of men stained with perspiration above the tall grass ; and beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorcycles , now loud , now sucked away , a drifting , weightless speed which never really touched the ground  --  until something would happenand the design would shift , the men would be running out onto the track and a cloud of dust would ease away to the fields . And afterward small boys would go out onto the deserted track and point out in the dust where the skidding had begun , and they would be able to see in the dirt the dark stains straining inward , toward the center where weeds grew beneath a veil of dust ; browned , wind-blown weeds with bright blue flowers , . Shell faced with contempt the weak encouragement of the boys . He put out his hands toward them , ceremoniously , very seriously . " Give me some dirt for it , " he said.  |p164he  day Laura saw her brother Kess for the last time  --  the oldest brother , the one she always pictured in her mind 's eye with the fine blond hair  --  it was spring , she remembered , a soft , mild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main road onto a road she had never been on before but had only looked at in the past , sitting in the back of the truck with her three brothers . The road was narrower than the one they always followed into town , but it was made of the same colorless gravel , with big rocks now and then lying di/rectly before them , looking sharp and heavy , as though someone  --  somelittle boys  --  had deliberately set them there and run away . The smell of fresh earth rose in the air . They had driven that morning up through the hills , all the way from the Rapids , and everywhere Laura had seen men out in thlds , and horses , and machines , and row upon row of thick twistings of earth , torn up to face the sun , glistening . Her father drove without speaking , without glancing at her . Laura , used to his attention , used to his fond lingering smile  --  she was the youngest of his four children and the only girl  --  could not understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutal jerks , and why he did not look at her . Sometimes they passed men along the road , just crossing from a field or a lane , and the men would nod to her father , and he would nod in return . These men wore overalls and pale blue shirts , faded and worn , like those Laura 's father always wore ; but today he had on the queer black suit Laura had seen only once or twice before , when they had driven so far with her brother and her grandmother and some aunts to see someone with a new baby , and they had taken the baby to a church and done something to it ; and one other time  --  she could not remember . . . Already her attentionhad been drained off to something else , to a man standing at a crossroads before them . The man stood with a suitcase at his feet and his arms at his sides ; he wore no hat ; he stood with his shoulders a little slumped , as Laura 's father 's were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes on them all the while . " He wants to come to Derby like us , " Laura said . She leaned forward , ready to smile at the man . " Pa , it 's just a man by himself who . . . " But her father said nothing . They approached the man ; now Laura stared hard at him as though it were very important that she remember what he looked like  --  a man of about fifty-five , thin , dirty , with a tired , blank ex/pression , maybe sick  --  and then they were past him ; her father had not slowed at all . " There ai n't no way for him to get there , " Laura said . The man 's empty look had pierced her . " Pa , there ai n't no way  --  he 'll have to walk by himself . . . " " You keep still , " her father said . She saw him glance , once , into the rear-view mirror , his neck and jaw for a moment straining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said how long ago . Now they had turned off the road that led to town , to the main street and the stores and , farther down , the granaries , and were driving past infrequent houses , some of them abandonedand boarded up , the grass about them stunted and brown . Laura looked out the open window . Even here the high sweet odor of springtime breathed against her ; she put her hand out the window as if to touch it . Then her father said , " Laura , " suddenly , and went on in a peculiar tone , almost of careless , rough uneasiness : " If your grandma wants to know what we did today , then you tell her we come to get some feed . I am goin ' to get it , later . But that 's all you tell her . Will you re-member ? " " Yes , " Laura said . " You look at me , " he said . She turned to look at him : He was driving more slowly now , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white against the worn black of the wheel . " You know you ai n't seen Kess for a time . I tole you a little about that before , an ' your grandma too . I never saw much need to worry her about it . Tom an ' Evan , they been in to see him , but I tole them never to say anything . Now I thought it was time for you to see him an ' to say good-by . " Laura stared ahead . She had not seen Kess for several months ; he was off somewhere  --  it had something to do with town . He had always gone off to town , getting a ride in withp167someone , and once he took Evan 's bicycle and rode all the way , and never came back till Monday night . That was over a year ago , though . She had not seen him for three or four months . She liked Kess ; he used to carry her around  --  when she broke her leg and had to wear a cast all summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had the lightest hair of any of them . It was light as corn silk and just as soft ; their grandmotheralways said he was a pure Walpole , he had the Walpole look , all except his eyes , which were brown and not blue . " I asked you where Kess was , " Laura said slowly , " but you never said . But you knew where he was . " Her father turned onto another road . Laura looked at him . She felt afraid , for some reason ; she wished her father would look at her and smile , or that they had gone right through to town . " I asked Evan too , but he never said . How come you tole him and not me ? An ' Tom too . How come you tole them ? " Laura sat still ; she felt petulant and warm ; she felt her throat tighten with anger . Then she thought of something . " Kess broke my leg that time . It was his fault it happened , " she said suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was his fault it happened . " " You keep still , " her father said . " It was n't but half his fault . I remember . " " He tole me to climb to the top . He said a cherry tree is so strong that  --  " " You keep still . Now . . . " He had stopped the truck . Laura stared out past her father 's averted face to a building set close to the road . It looked small , and then Laura saw how it went back and around on both sides , painted dark brown but streaked around the bottom as if with mud , and on the roof long frail slashes , as though the paint there had been eaten away . Alongside the building , perhaps fifty feet away , and winding about tightly , there was a narrow creek now close to overflowing . It churned white about a small rapids , foaming thinly aroundp168rocks and occasional boulders , disappearing under a wooden bridge and so out of sight . Laura stared at the strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found herself scrutinizing his hair , wheat-colored and gray , and his collar , and the glazed black material of the suit . " Now you come to say good-by to Kess , " he said , not looking at her , " an ' you remember it . You remember it all along . " " Is Kess in there ? " Laura said . " Get out this side , " said her father . He had opened the door , still not looking at her . She slid across the seat and got out ; the ground felt strange and precarious beneath her feet . Then she felt her father pull at her arm . He shut the truck door and turned up the short walk , pulling at her arm . " Is Kess inside there ? Why is he inside there ? " she said . Everything was still except for the clean , clear sound of the creek at its rapids  --  its miniature rapids  --  and the sound of birds out of sight . The building that jutted out to them , out nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its windows were dirty . Laura thought probably there would be no one inside . On the left there was a brown vine that went up to the roof by way of a drainpipe and then out of sight . It looked dead ; it had not been able to last through the long winter , it had not come back to life like everything else . " Why is he in there ? " Laura said . Her breath had started to come fast , and did not go deep . " Pa , " she said , " I do n't want to go in . I 'll wait for you out in , . . . " Her father said nothing . They went up to the screen door , and her father rapped on it and went inside , as though someone had told him to come in ; Laura , following him , had heard nothing . She shrank behind him , looking around past his aim . A man with shirt sleeves buttoned neatly down to his wrists , with a tight , bulging look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another man leaned against a doorway at the rear , lookingp169at them . Both had just stopped talking and looked at Laura and her father . " Ah , Walpole , " one of the men said ; it was the man sitting heavily on the desk . He smiled slowly , and Laura thought that his face squeezed and rearranged itself , his thick , lard-colored cheeks pushed by his smile . He nodded to them , to her father , as though he were pretending something . Laura could not understand it : The man smiled at her father in such a peculiar way , he acted as if there was something between them , a secret , and Laura 's father , instead of straighteningand staring coldly at him , instead of saying something , whatever he might say  --  she did not know what  --  merely stood with Laura hanging onto his arm , and took a heavy , tired breath , and did not reply . " Well , " the man said , " there ai n't much more time for them long drives up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Laura did not think it was hot , and the other man laughed . The fat man turned to him ; he was pleased he had made him laugh . The other man , leaning in the doorway , his foot up and flat against the tilted door , wore something on his shirt pocket that glinted in the dim light : a badge , a sheriff 's badge or something like it . He moved lazily out of the way . " Come on , " the fat man said , now that he had ceased to smile all at once and looked warm and tired . There were some keys on a ring hangingfrom his wide brown belt ; he began to shake them as though he were impatient . He stood in the doorway and shook them ; they made a sharp , annoying noise . He looked back at Laura and her father and waited for them to come along . He let them go first . Laura could tell from his expression when he turned that he looked back to the other man and did something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they stepped down into the hall , onto a dirt floor , she heard the other man 's laughter drift mildly and without effort after them , and then the door closed.  | " I never seen this one before , " the man said . He touched Laura 's shoulder . His hand felt big and hot ; there seemed to be no fingers but only thick flesh on it . " Is she his sister ? " Laura 's father , walking ahead , turned and put his arm around her shoulders . Laura craned her neck to look back at the fat man . " How many more of them is there ? " the man said . He spoke broadly and slowly ; he was still shaking the keys . " I seen two or three boys , now . An ' you . How come his ma never come in to see him ? Or ai n't you tole her yet ? " They were walking on a dirt floor . It was hard and packed . About them the air smelled damp and close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could smell food  --  stale food , maybe potatoes , and soured milk , the way the air smelled in the corner of the barn where the cats were fed . At first she could see only the wall , which seemed to be made of brick , and then it gave way to a door of heavy wood with a leather strap for a handle : a broad , thick strap that was worn colorless and stuck rigidly out . The man put his hand on it ; his fingers , thick and familiar , seemed to caress the strap . Higher up on the door , at the level of her father 's and the man 's faces , there was a little window ; but Laura could see nothing through it save a darker expanse of wall and ceiling . The man unlocked the door and swung it out ; Laura had to step out of the way as he opened it . A soft effusion of air , close and warm and unhealthy , eased darkly out upon them . " You , Walpole , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet for a moment , waiting , listening ; his arm , from his elbow to his wrist , a neat expanse of blue cotton , was pressed against the doorway and held still . Then the man turned back to them and moved slowly aside , again smiling . Laura did not look at him , though she could feel his eyes upon her and her father , caressing them softly and familiarly , as though he were somehow related to them . " I do n't need to lockp171it ; he wo n't go nowhere . Go on in , " he said . " Just come up front when you want to leave . " Laura 's father still held her arm . She followed along beside him . They stepped through the doorway , into the pocket of dank air , Laura leaning back against her father all the while ; and then she saw her brother there sitting on something , a little bed , and a window high up on the wall beside him , and the sky they had just seen smooth and blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a slow gesture of some sort with his hand : he was smoking a cigarette . Laura stared at him . Her father now stood quite straight and tall . Laura could not reach up to him ; she did not know what to do . Kess looked vaguely at her father and then at her , but he did not say anything and he did not seem really to see them . Kess seemed different somehow ; there was something changed about him  --  he looked as though he were caught back in winter still , in their long , endless , bitter winter , his face without expression , quiet , pale , and empty , caught back in a time through which they had all moved and which the rest of them had , somehow , conquered . " I brought Laura along to say good-by to you , " her father said . His voice sounded peculiar and loud , as though he had not spoken for some time . But Kess did not seem to hear it ; he remained seated on the cot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his knee and the other holding a cigarette stiffly before his mouth . In the poor light his eyes seemed unusually dark , like holes in his face . " Laura ! Ca n't you say somethin ' to him , Laura ? " her father said . Laura waited for Kess to look at her . But his eyes were lost off somewhere ; they fell past her father and onto the wall . " Ca n't you say somethin ' ? " Laura 's father said . He squeezed her arm so that it hurt . " It ai n't  --  it ai n't him , it ai n't Kess , " Laura said . She was trying to turn around . Now she felt something hot come to herp172eyes ; she thought in dismay and anger that she was crying , like a little child ; she was going to cry in front of them . " It ai n't him there , " she said . " Laura . " Her father gripped her still . " There 's a reason I brought you here . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It ai n't him , he never used to  --  he never used to smoke . . " Laura stared at her brother again ; she felt his eyes , as if by accident , move onto her . They showed no sign of recognitionor even interest . " He said how he never would . He tole me an ' Evan , he tole us not to try it . . . " Kess put the cigarette to his mouth again . He seemed to be watching himself  --  watching his own movements . He leaned back so that his head and the back of his neck touched the soiled wall . " You never needed to come back again , " he said . He spoke slowly , as if he were talking to the air or to himself . " There 's a reason I brought her here , " Laura 's father said . " I tole you not to come back . Why do you come back ? " Kess said . Then he stopped talking and lay back for a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . He might have been listening to something they could not hear , perhaps to the men in the front of the building . " I only mean to do the right thing , " Laura 's father said . " I tole you not to come , " Kess said slowly . " An ' her specially . But then it ai n't anythin ' to me now . " " I got to do the right thing , " Laura 's father said . " It ai n't always what you want . An ' to see you too . . . There 's still some things I want to know . " Kess lay without moving . Now he did not even smoke . He seemed caught in a dream , trapped in a dream . Laura stood leaning against her father 's thigh , staring at her brother . About his face his hair fell softly and thickly , but in this light it seemed struck of its color , not blond but only pale , white , with/out life , . It seemed to Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living again , the way it set other things living . " Some things I want to ask you , " Laura 's father said , " so I know it straight . About what happened . I got to know it all . I got to have it there so when I think back on it , an ' on you , I 'll know how it went . " " It do n't matter , " Kess said . " But do you know what day it is ? " " That do n't matter either . " " You were markin ' them for a while . . . " Laura 's father peered at something on the wall , beneath the window . There were some scratches there . " Did you quit keepin ' count ? Do n't you care any more ? " " It do n't matter , " Kess said . " But how short a time it is , an ' you layin ' there ! What am I to think back on ? How you sit an ' smoke , nothin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  You ai n't a person , " Laura 's father said bitterly , and as he spoke Kess gazed up at him . " You ai n't got anythin ' in you to name . Do you sit there , day an ' day , sit there an ' smoke ? Is that what you do ? " Kess took the cigarette from his mouth and shook the ashes off ; they fell slowly , drifting down to the cot . He did not brush them away . His face tightened suddenly as if he was going to cough , but he did not cough , and after a moment he said , " There is n't anythin ' that I come from , that I can remember ; only sometimes one thing  --  one thing . . . But mostly there is n't anythin ' . No home or land or anythin ' . I like to do this . Becausewhen the smoke comes in . . . " He lifted the cigarette and looked at it . " When it comes in it goes down your throat an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . " Then it quits bein ' hot , an ' the heat goes off into you like regular smoke . It goes off mostly down , an ' around where your heart is . It keeps on inside . Then it 's time for it to come out again . You make itp174come out again . Then you get more an ' make it go in . It wears out things inside , it mixes with blood an '  --  things . . . An ' then when they come for me , why , then , there wo n't be nothin ' left but a outside  --  only somethin ' to look at . An ' when they put their hands on me only a outside , everythin ' else eaten away , nothin ' left for them to do it to . " He began smoking the cigarette again . He smiled a little , looking at his father . " I never thought of any of it but by accident . I never smoked before . One time he came in here smokin ' , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there  --  the one that let you in . An ' he came back later . He came back with more cigarettes , later . Then he started comin ' in like he does now , once a day or so , 1 think , an ' he talks to me an ' all . An ' if I ask him he 'll give me cigarettes , like he did last night . He gave me all these . " Kess did not point to anything but only lay still , looking at his father and sister , . " How it first happened was when he came in to talk after the trial . He tole me not to worry about it . He explained how it would have to be . The other ones never did that , or you either , they mostly wanted to talk about other things . But he explained it . He sat over there  --  he brought that in , that box to sit on . He sat there , an ' I sat here . He tole me about what would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like it none , an ' felt sorry for me . He gave me a cigarette . He said how he wished there was somethin ' to do for me , but there was n't anythin ' , an ' how I had ruint it for myselfby what I said  --  what I stood up an ' said that time in court . He said that was a mistake . So he explained how it would have to be . . . Then I felt somethin ' on my foot pressin ' down , an ' all of a sudden it made me tired to look down an ' sleepy , an ' when I did I saw it was just his foot , that he had on my foot , an ' pressin ' down . . . " He went on speaking ; Laura , watching him , no longer heard his words , which she did not understand , but heard only their sound  --  a gentle , soothing , ca/ressing sound , like that of the fat man 's voice . Sometimes Kess coughed as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move much , only jerking suddenly  --  it must have hurt him  --  and then continuing , speaking as if nothing had happened , gazing up at his father . Then he said suddenly , in a different voice , " I 'm only tired , I wish it was ended . . . There ai n't no time here  --  Pa , " he said , " there ai n't no time but only one thing keepin ' on an ' on . . . An ' with him , him too , but I ca n't help it on account of the cigarettes . . . There ai n't no time here , by myselfthere ai n't anythin ' , like there was nobody caught in here at all . I can make myself go away if I want . Then there 's nothin ' here . But if you come  --  if you come in . . . Then I 'm back myself again , I 'm sittin ' here with you , I ca n't help it . I tole you not to come , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me come back , you make me be myself . God damn you , " he said . He got to his feet abruptly and a little clumsily , turning away from them and to the window . Laura could hear his hard breath . As he stood there the air from the window touched against him , against his hair . Then Kess said quietly , without turning to them , " This is a world of windows . I ai n't goin ' to mind leavin ' a world of windows . " Laura waited for him to go on . But he only stood there ; he might have been looking out at the sky . He stood with one arm up on the window sill , and the cigarette smoke lifting up and easing out the window , drawn away from him . They all stood for some time without moving : Laura and her father before the cot ; Kess beside it at the window , his narrow back to them . Laura felt strange and tired , she felt suddenly sleepy or dizzy ; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of her leg again , and how she had broken it , how she had fallen down through the tree  --  the black branches tearing and slamming at her , and the leaves churning , and the blackbirds fluttering up in terror , and at the bottom Kess standing withp176his arms outstretched and his face white and distorted , his mouth open , watching her fall . " Laura ! Laura ! " he had cried ; she had heard him as she fell , all mixed in with the blackbirds and the sky and the hot flat odor of cherries , and his face turningoff to one side and shooting up , and his hands shooting up . Later on that summer he had carried her around . He used to sit squatting in the dirt , while her father held her on his lap , and play with the chickens before her and put rings from the feed store on their legs . He would carry her down to the creek bank by the big tree where they swam and set her down , and keep coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when he ran with the rope and swung out over the water , his legs kicking , his hair lifted pale and fine in the air while they all watched , he would yell , " Look here , Laura ! Look here ! " And at the peak of the terrific flight outward he would let go , the rope jerked from his fingers , and he would fall out and down , down into the water . How her heart had tightened and released with joy , watching him ! Laura 's father cleared his throat . " I come to ask you some things . I want you to answer this time , an ' to look at me . There ai n't that much time left . " Kess did not look around . " A personhas got to know the truth , " Laura 's father said . She thought he sounded tired and maybe old , the way he talked to grandma when he did n't care much what he said and wanted to get past , out of the kitchen and away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. " Kess turned . He was about as tall as Laura 's father , and he wore a gray jacket , buttoned to his throat as though he were cold . In the glare of the light behind him his face looked like something in an old photograph  --  light in places , shadowed in others . " I got the bastard down on the gravel , an ' then I could n't help myself , " he began , speaking suddenly and quickly . " I could n't . I was goin ' to wait with the knife till he wentp177home , acrost fields , but when I got him down I could n't wait  --  I could n't wait . . . How his blood tasted , that made me all wild . . . " He hesitated ; he looked at them , smiling . " I ought to of said that to you before . But I never thought of it when you were here , . I thought of it at night sometimes , an ' when he talks to me about it an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ready when you come . . . Sometimes I ca n't remember it , " he said , " an ' then I try hard , I work to bring it back . Sometimesin the day when there 's noise outside . But at night there 's only the crick outside , the only noise , an ' then it comes  --  it comes so close . . . An ' I can feel how his skin was , an ' his cheek , when I got him down an ' sunk my teeth in his face  --  like they said at the trial . . . It could n't of been no diffrentthan that , " Kess said . He took a deep breath . He looked at them . " If I was to do it now it could n't be no diffrent . It comes back to me that close . . . A goddam fine thing !  --  an ' him like in a dream always fallin ' in front of me on the gravel , an ' me bendin ' to do it  --  over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was a silence . Laura could hear nothing at first ; then sounds came to her  --  the sound of men talking somewhere in the front of the building , and the sound of the creek outside , and another sound that must have been the wind . Laura 's father looked around vaguely . " Yes , " he said . " All right . We have to . . . " He looked down at Laura . " We have to leave . We have to buy some . . . " He paused again . He seemed to be waiting for something to happen , for someone to speak . Kess stood with the cigarette burning in his hand ; he stood quite straight , his lower lip caught under his teeth , his look struck , again , away from them . " We have to get some feed before we go home , " Laura 's father said , " it must be  --  it must be after noon . . . " He made a move to turn away , but Kess stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . Laura 's father turned backp178clumsily . " Yes , " he said . Kess , his hand upraised , smiled at them in a way Laura remembered , suddenly  --  the way he had always smiled . " Wait , " he said . He seemed confused . " I ought to . . . I ought to . . . " He pressed the cigarette against the wall and put it out . " I ought to give you a thing  --  what they call it  --  a . . . Somethin ' to give to a person when you die . I ought to give it now . " He spoke oddly , in a singsong voice . " I ought to give it to you , " he said . He gave what was left of the cigarette  --  a short , twisted butt  --  to Laura ; he pressed it into her hand . " That there is Laura , " he said . " Well . So you come to say good-by . " He was still looking at them when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura could not see ; her eyes were filled with tears . She heard her father speak to the man , heard the man reply , and heard him walk to the door ; he walked heavily , he brushed against something , perhaps some papers , as he passed . Then he was gone , and then they were outside . The air was humid and warm and smelled like grass and like the earth . Laura could hardly breathe at first . Then she found she could . Their truck was in front of them ; they were walking toward it . Suddenly something happened : Laura threw the cigarette down , she knew she had thrown it down . She was crying , " It was n't him ! It was n't him ! " She stared at the dirt walk , at the cigarette . Then her father 's hand came around , faster than she could see . He struck her on the cheek . " You pick that up ! " he said . She was staring at the ground ; it turned to water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to you . Pick it up . " She bent and picked up the cigarette . She looked at it , and then her father gripped her arm and they went to the truck . She got up into it before him and slid across the cracked leather of the seat , still looking at the cigarette , and then he got in be/side her . She sat quite still , hardly breathing . She waited for the truck to start . Her father did not sit very close to her . He moved about and did things , moving jerkily , and the engine started . Laura was thinking of something . She held the broken cigarette , but she was thinking of something else . It rushed back upon her . It was about another morning long ago , in summer , and she was crying ; one of them had propped her up and left her , gone off behind the barns . The dog had run after him . She was left alone by the steps to the hay barn , her leg in the soiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crying , and then someonecame up behind her out of the barn and down the haystrewnsteps . She knew it was Kess before she turned , and there he was grinning down at her , in his arms a white hen with its feet clawing against his chest . " Watch her dance for you , " Kess had said , and holding the hen by its wings , he made it dance wildly about , jerking it up off the ground and thumping it back down again , the red rings on its legs shaking . And Laura laughed , her face hurting with laughter , watching the hen and Kess 's grinning face above it , laughing with her : her brother Kess , again no more than thirteen years old.  |p180It  was early afternoon when Swan reached the brink of the hill that sloped down to town . He gazed at it , at the flat , . watery image he had been seeing for so long in his mind 's eye , and it was with an almost careless , brutal gesture that he drew his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt road to the town , walking slowly , casually , his head bent a little against the overhead glare . He thought briefly of how the sun must look above him , drained back into the great colorless sky . It was incredible how the heat lay about him and how hep181could feel himself moving through it , how he could feel it almost like water pressing against him . He did not regret being hatless . He did not regret that when three or four cars had slowed down alongside him he had waved them by ; he thought of them without any feeling at all . He found himself staring at the ground , at his dusty feet , as though he had not the strength to look up . Yet he kept on , the close , paled image of the town before him : the town with its giant elms and its narrow main street , its tight little hills , the string of stores that curled and blinked gaudily in the heat . If he followed this road along he would go through the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rust ; and after that the houses and the stores would vanish and he would be in the country again , on this same road and with orchards on each side of him  --  quiet and lonely in the summer heat . But now he was nearly in the town . Glancing ahead , he saw it suddenly before him ; it appeared almost to have leaped toward him with a swift , flicking movement . He hesitated only a moment . Then he crossed to the side of the road , his eyes level , calm , squinting only from time to time against the light , fasteningthemselves upon cars that passed him now and then , cars and trucks and their weary , listless drivers . He saw the frame houses along the roadside begin , houses with bare front yards , with children squatting in the dust watching him steadily in their dark , mindless manner . The trees seemed to be thinning out , though there were some ahead in the park . Beyond the heat that seemed tangibly to surround him , the air was filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on other streets as well as on this one , whining by him and by the houses at which he had not yet really looked . At the park he began to feel a sudden numbing pain in his legs ; he had not noticed it before , and he thought with a flash of anger that he ought to have accepted a ride with one of thosep182drivers , he ought not to have turned them away as he had , it was a childish thing to do . Still , it had been entirely correct and he knew it ; there was nothing else he could have allowed himself to do . He peered across the park at a drugstore that faced it . The store looked empty , its windows blind above the wavering heat . Certainly it would be cooler there : He could imagine the dim array of glass and slanted merchandise ; he could see someone 's face turning abruptly toward him as he entered , away from an opened newspaper , perhaps , or a conversation with another person . They would look at him , recognizinghim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a boy driven into town  --  and with his neat surface respectfulness , surely he must impress the men in this way ; or , if there was a woman there , surely she would gaze at him with interest , she could not avoid it , she would even know his name , she would ask after his family . Swan wiped his forehead again , staring dizzily at the blank window of the drugstore . He could see reflectedin their quiet , waiting eyes  --  in the eyes of those imaginedpersons inside  --  his own face : He would seem to them a strong boy , a strong young man , a little distracted by the heat , perhaps , and yet this would not be unusual , they would think nothing of it , it did not mean he had walked into town all by himself . . . . Then what would he do ? Would he grip the momentas though it were a part of something winding steadily away ? Would he stop , simply cease , would he hold that instant of mindless acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist this , what strength it might demand to keep himself from groping backward for the door and stepping out onto the sidewalk , spent , relieved , quietly hysterical  --  not absolved of his sin or delivered of his punishment but simply in another dimension altogether , no longer related to it , to that which he would be able to think about later , idly ; after a time it would probably no longer even be interesting , belonging onlyp183to another of his selves and never to the boy they would gaze upon and mold with their eyes , his father 's son after all , only a boy come into town on a hot afternoon . But he crossed the park , his head down and his hands stiff in his pockets . When he looked up again he was approaching the sheriff 's office , a squat , peeling building set close to the road . It seemed quiet , empty , like so much of the town , yet with a quality of watchfulness in spite of this , as though it were looking out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorless wood that stretched out now on each side of him and rose above him  --  clapboards beginning to curl , windows that let in no light at all , a single vine stiff against the corner of the building as though it had been nailed there .. Swan rapped on the screen door and opened it ; the volition of his own hands surprised him . " Hello , there , " someone said . Swan saw a man sitting at the window , his feet up on the dirty sill , his arms folded ; apparently he had been sitting there for some time , doing nothing , perhaps just waiting for Swan . Behind him a boy was stooping over a pile of newspapers  --  one of the Negroes ; when Swan came in , his face jerked up immediately . " You want somethin ' , boy ? What do you want ? " Swan leaned back against the door . He shrugged his shoutders . " I do n't know , " he said . He thought how another boy might answer . " Just come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , there ai n't anything . " The man still had not moved . Now Swan saw that he was a heavy person , so heavy that perhaps moving pained him , at least moving in this close , choking air ; only his eyes were alert , and these fastened themselves on Swan 's face in a familiar , crowding way . " You do n't need to leave , though . You can stick around if you want to , " he said . Swan shrugged his shoulders again . He allowed his gaze to wander about the room , his back against the screen door , hisp184ears filled with a hushed , frantic sound like breathing  --  his own breathing  --  which the man and that boy there , still bent over the pile of newspapers but with his face uplifted , must surely be listening to , . Maybe that was why they remained so still and so quiet : They were waiting for what he had come to tell them . " There 's just us here today , " the man said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pris'ners in back , too , but there ai n't many . You come into town for the day ? " Swan 's eyes flitted aimlessly away from the man . " Yes , " he said . " Where are you from ? " " The Rapids , " said Swan . He looked at the man . " Do you know where that is ? " " Sure . Could n't be a deppity for long without knowin ' that place , " the man said . Swan watched him for a moment ; he felt uneasy about the way the man had replied . Yet this person could not know him  --  Swan had never seen him before  --  just a deputy , a thick , heavy man , his eyes stung neatly into his broad face , fixing Swan with that slow , effortless smile . " Why , Chap here is from around there himself . Ai n't you , Chap ? " Swan looked briefly at the Negro boy . He saw that he was thin and short , that he was at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult to figure out his exact age . His face contorted as Swan glanced at him , as though someonewere tightening it slowly and deliberately with a screw . Swan saw , too , that the boy had a dirty strip of white gauze wrapped around his head , concealing one eye . " That there 's name is Chaparral , " the deputy said . " Ai n't that a name for you ? We come out an ' got him somewhere around the Rapids , it was n't but a while ago . Ai n't that a name for you , now ? They 'll name themselves mostly anything . " Swan was conscious of the way the man smiled at him , of thep185man 's apparent feeling that his smile must include Swan , must lure him into smiling too . " You ai n't tole me your name , " the deputy said . " I 'm a Walpole , " said Swan . His words sounded queer and loud . " I just thought I 'd .. . come over to see what was here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , when you 're my age you 'll be glad of such days , " the deputy said . " You can stick around , though . You can never tell with a sheriff office like this is , . " " Is there much trouble ? " " There is sometimes . Course we do n't hear about most of the trouble . " Swan watched him closely . " Most of it just happensout there , an ' we never know about it . " " What kind of things ? " " Well  --  if I knew that , then I 'd know about them ! " the deputy said . His eyes were pinning Swan to the wall . " I reckon anybody from the Rapids would know more themselves what was goin ' on . Anything can happen out in the country ; could n't nobody catch up on all that goes on . " Swan shrugged again , looking away . " Ai n't that right , Chap ? " The deputy leaned around to look at the boy . " You get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookin ' at you all this time ? What do you think we pay you for , standin ' around like that ? " The boy licked his lips and , to Swan 's astonishment , began laughing  --  in a sudden , rushed way , as though his laughter surprised himself but as though he could not help it . The deputy glanced back at Swan . " Must be somethin ' funny , " he said , . " Well . I do n't criticize them , specially ones born like this one . Long as he gets his job done , it do n't much matter . " The boy picked up the pile of smudged newspapers and tookp186them to the back door , still laughing , though more quietly now and almost secretly , looking back at Swan with his single , heavy-lidded eye . " It ai n't in me to criticize them , " the deputy said , sighing . " They ai n't like us . " " Yes , " said Swan . " What was his name ? Chaparral ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't never think of what it might mean . " " Someone told them to call him that , " Swan said . " What ? " " I said , someone maybe told them to call him that . Some white man . I do n't know . " The deputy watched him for a while . " Well , " he said finally , though he still looked at him in the same way , " you can see it 's a quiet day here . " Swan nodded vaguely . " An ' hot too . As hot as hell in here . " The inside of the building suddenly struck Swan as being very small and very airless ; and the darkness of the stained ceiling and the far corners was even oppressive . For an instant Swan was compelled to think of the unbelievable ease with which he could leave , if he wanted to . The deputy was still talking . " A hot summer too , " he said , " a hot dry summer . . . " " Does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? " " That one there . The one who  --  you know . Does he work here for you ? " " Oh ! Him . Yeah , what do you s'pose he 's doin ' ? He do n't have no fambly that we know of ; he has to have somethin ' to do with himself . What makes you ask ? " Swan was watching the back door , . " It would n't be bad , to work in a sheriff office like this . " The man laughed . " I expect there 's a lot of things goin ' on , sometimes , " Swanp187said . " When they bring in people to lock up . " He began sucking the tip of his forefinger . " There 's worse things he could do . " " Sure . " " The ones like him never get good jobs . They got the worst land here too . " Swan was quiet for a moment . " I wonder how he got to laughin ' just then . " " That ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " He was laughin ' at me . " " No . He just felt like it . " " It looked like  --  " " It might of been your hair . " " What ? " " He said somethin ' about hair that color , once . When we got him . There ai n't many people he sees with hair so light . " The boy came back inside then , noisily ; now that he was no longer carrying anything he looked to Swan a little taller , even larger perhaps . His face was a mass of stiff , arrested wrinkles ; he might have just finished laughing . " He do n't mean anything by it , " the deputy said . " He ai n't too bad . I do n't much care to look at his face , how it is , but he gets things done . You , Chap , " the deputy said . Now his tone had altered ; it sounded almost buoyant . " You show the boy here how smart you are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on days like this here , sittin ' around with nothin ' to do . Now you , Chap , you tell me how much is two an ' two put together , . " The boy was staring at the side of the deputy 's face . He answered softly , " Four . " The deputy grinned at Swan . " Hear that ? I taught it in him myself . He takes to me like I was a regular teacher . Now , Chap . How much is three an ' three put together ? " " Six . " " Four an ' four ? "  | " Eight . " " Now . How much is five an ' five ? " " Ten . " The boy spoke deliberately and politely , watching the deputy . " Hear that ? He learnt just as easy . He can even tell me how much is eight take away four ? " " Four . " " Ai n't he quick at that ? " the deputy said . Swan was staring at them . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Go on , now . Ask him some yourself . " " All right , " Swan said . He was leaning back against the door ; he could feel the warmer air outside touching his head , part of his neck . " How much is ten take away five ? " The boy 's eyes jerked to him . " Five , " he said . " How much is five take away ten ? " " Backwards  --  backwards of five . " The deputy peered at Swan . " There ai n't no answer to that , " he said . " What did you ask him ? " " He answered it all right . " " What did you ask ? Five take away ten ? " " Yes . " The deputy laughed . " There ai n't no answer to that , then . It ca n't be done , . " Now he nodded toward the boy . " Here , that 's enough standin ' around . Take the rest of them papers out back , will you ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't . " He waited a minute ; perhaps he could feel the boy listeningintently to him . " You go on , now . " " Yes , " said the boy . " Take care . You 're goin ' to lose this job if you do n't do it right . " The boy passed them and went to the stacks of stained newspapers . " He learnt that just as easy , them arithmetic things . Only it'sp189queer how he does it . He do n't think on it any . You seen him . It 's like his voice just says the answer , an ' he do n't need to think on it himself . " Swan laughed shortly . " I s'pose so , " he said . " It 's a queer thing . I ca n't figure it , but then  --  you heard him yourself . " " Well , " Swan said abruptly . He cleared his throat . " I hope I ai n't  --  in nobody 's way here . " " What ? No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get in the way of the law or somethin ' . . . The reason I come over is I do n't get to see many folks , out where I live . " Swan went on glibly , his eyes drifting back and forth across the man 's face . " It 's a lonely enough place . " " Ai n't you got any friends your own age ? " " No . " " Not any ones at all ? " Swan was gazing at the man . The deputy 's voice came to him out of the dim and faintly heavy air of the room , warm , more than warm , in a manner that seemed to him familiar , as though this had all happened once before , or perhaps he had only dreamed it  --  but if he had dreamed it , it was much more carefully , with more detail than the manner in which it was really happening now ; that was the way of all dreams . So he watched the man carefully , listening for his words ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what the man was thinking . " You must have friends in school , have n't you ? " the man said softly . " You must get to know some ones there your own age . " " No , " said Swan . " You must  --  " " No , " said Swan . lie spoke in a sharp , petulant way , like a child . " There ai n't any . "  | " Any what ? Any other kids ? " " Any ones my own age ! " " Any ones your . . . " The deputy eyed him for a moment , almost slyly ; then his face relaxed . He sat without moving , his hands fatly before him , his trousers tight across his thick , creased knees . " You could always be friends with ones not your own age , then . " Swan , looking at the man , aware of the boy stooping and tuggingat something just behind him , wondered why the scene fixed so listlessly about him did not disintegrate , vanish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and himselfwithin it , within this dim , airless room , with this fat man so bluntly before him . What could he mean by it , sitting there so heavily , so profoundly , gazing at Swan ? What notions prompted him to remain without moving in the presence of a contempthe must surely feel , so deliberately thrusting his presence out upon Swan ? The deputy 's expression was veiled , knowing ; now he was calculating how correct he had been in sitting there , waiting for someone to come to him . And the boy behind him with that dirty white bandage about his head , now straighteningit , now wiping his dark , glistening forehead  --  what might sustain him , a creature like that , what might force him in that pained and yet contented way to draw one breath after another , on and on , tediously , incredibly , long before Swan had ever seen him and , of course , long after he would leave ? " Somethin ' wrong with you ? " the deputy said . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't somethin ' wrong ? " Swan shook his head . He could hear his breath again , a loud , rasping , annoying sound ; he was sure that even the Negro boy , bent over the papers in that awkward , exaggerated position , his face averted , must be hearing the sound of that breath/ing . " I thought  --  I thought you were a deputy here , " Swan said , groping in his confusion . " I thought  --  " " What ? What makes you say that ? " the deputy said loudly . " I sure am a deppity here ! " " You are ? But  --  " " I sure am ! What do you think I mean to do , sittin ' here , if I was n't a deppity employed by this whole county , if I  --  " " But you ai n't got a badge on . " " I ai n't  --  oh . That . " The man glanced at the stained pocket of his shirt . " I ai n't got it on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't need a badge to be a lawman , now , do you ? Even a country boy like you ought to know that . You do n't need a shiny thing stuck on your shirt to uphold the law . " Swan nodded slowly . His head had begun to ache . He felt it was time to speak ; the deputy seemed to be waiting for him . " It 's just on account of how lonely it gets , out where I live , " he began uncertainly . " The reason I come here , I mean . I thought I would just come here to see how things were . " This was fine : the man was listening closely , his smile about to widen at any moment ; even the Negro boy was peering at him out of his one squinted eye in a hushed and respectful manner  --  thoughthat of course looked ridiculous , since he was stooped and held what must have been a heavy bundle of old papers before him in the most awkward way . " A boy likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets , " he said . He imagined the deputy was even nodding . What must he say next , what would lead him to his story ? He groped for a moment , his hands coming loose at his sides ; he must keep on talking . " You would n't know how lonely it gets there , " he said . " But then it must of always been that way , that was how it was first of all . Sometimes I see it like it must of looked to the ones whop192come to this land first , a land they did n't even know was here till they saw it . What must that of been , to see what they did ? This building here and the street , the whole town , none of it built but only land . . .. How they must of thought on it , how it must of lured them to it , that they could n't resist ; a place where all things might be different , where nothing had anything to do with anything else yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . . . . Come to a new land , how could you remember what you used to be ? Do n't you think that 's right ? Do n't you ? " He was speaking earnestly now  --  his voice had never been more earnest  --  pleading with both the deputy and the boy . " Settlers . . . pioneers . . , . sure , " the deputy said vaguely . " But I think it might not of been that way , really , " Swan went on , as if this were some profound sadness , as if they were really listening . " I think it might of been like it always was . This was no new world to them ; this was the old world still . When they come they made it old . .. . Even with all time ahead , it wo n't get any different , will it ? So much time ahead , I mean , you 'd think it could wear down anything . Do n't you think so ? " The deputy was frowning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said slowly and with the air of someone admitting a secret . " I would n't argue it . " " Well , then , " said Swan . He took a deep breath . " I mean to tell you about something happened a while ago . There was this church picnic they had , out in the Rapids , some church or whateverit was that has it every year on a Sunday . They 're known for their  --  chowder . " As he spoke he reached into his pocket slowly , decorously , so that he did not flick their eyes from his face . " What I heard about it was , these four or five boys , I do n't know what age , got in a fight or something . This always happens at picnics . Kids that ai n't seen each other for a time getp193all together and they always fight sooner or later , it 's just how kids are . You know . But there was something about . . . some other ones , maybe just two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , that were doing something too . . . . They should n't of come there . Or if they did they should n't have made much noise and to-do about it or try and run off with things ; they should of known somebody would see them . Because everyone was watching them all along , to see what they 'd do . You ca n't trust them with things out in the open , food and things . They sooner or later try to steal them to eat . So . I heard something about how they took something , a prize at a game , only they dropped it further on ; they were laughing and all , and carrying on  --  that they should n't of done either . They should n't have . So these other ones started in to chase them and there was some kind of fight , I guess , it sounds all mixed up now , a fight with green pears for a while . . . " Swan laughed . " It sounds just like kids , do n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughed again ; he was taken by surprise . The deputy smiled immediately , and even the Negro boy smiled , as though he understood Swan . " Well . They gave them a hard time , I guess ; they put up a hard enough fight . There was two of them . They crossed all these fields , running , going so far , and still laughing . . . . Then one of them went in the crick , and they heard him running in the water by the bank , just as clear as anything ; then it was just nothing  --  he got away . It was so dark they could n't find him anywhere . But the other one stopped by the crick . He was n't done fighting but only stopped and waited for them , you know . They 'll do that sometimes , like a rat you got chased all the way down a stairs . He just stopped . What he should of done was not fight any more . Anyone would tell him that . If I 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of them caughtp194up , all mad like they were  --  I 'd have told it to him so the others could n't hear , I 'd have whispered it to him , so he 'd understand . I 'd 've made him understand . But he did n't do that , they said later , he picked up some stones . . . " Swan had taken a pocketknife out and looked down at it , frowning . " Yes , " he said vaguely . " He should n't of done it . " The deputy was staring at him . Swan looked past the rusted blade of the knife at the man 's white , soft-looking face . " Why did you come here ? " the man said . Swan shrugged his shoulders . " A boy in at town , nothin ' to do ; why , we always come over . " " But why did you come here ? " " I do n't know , " Swan said . He spoke defiantly . " My father could n't give me much of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why . But 1 do n't know . I do n't . I do n't know why I do anything . " " Just a minute , now  --  " " I do n't know , " Swan said simply . He smiled , and the Negro boy 's teeth immediately gleamed , though the deputy only stared at him . " I do n't know why I do anything . There ai n't any reason . If there was a reason I would know about it , would n't I ? Here , now , what I meant to ask . . What I come in here to ask . . . If someone like that did what he did , took a knife and did something to another person ; say , cut at his eye with it . . . I was wondering how they would get at him to make up for it . " Swan spoke shyly now , since he realized the position of the deputy and the significance of that badge which was not even on his shirt ; he could feel his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they would cut out his own eye for him . I wondered if they would . They ought . But I mean to tell them that it ai n't enough . . . What they might do to him with a knife of their own would n't be enough . It would be just somethingp195equal to the other , what they do to him equal to what he did to the other person ; but that ai n't what they ought to get at . It 's the first  --  the first thought of it they ought to get . . . I was just wondering , " he said apologetically , " if they knew how to do it . Unless they let it be its own punishment , when you feel you 're bleeding inside . " Swan waited a moment , looking politely at the deputy . Then he stepped forward . The movement shocked both the deputy and the boy ; he saw their eyes dart to his fingers , where he held the knife loosely by its blade . The boy stared at him , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now how quickly he moved , and with what calm , dignified authority ; he merely reached out and took hold of Swan 's wrist , however . " You put that away , " he said . " Go on , now , put that away . There ai n't no need of this . " " I come all the  --  " " You heard me , boy . Put it away . " " But I come  --  " " Here , now . " He leaned to Swan ; he had begun to smile again . " You put that away . A fine-lookin ' boy like you , you do n't know what you mean . You do n't know what you mean by it . " Swan hesitated ; he looked at the deputy 's face , which , in the thinning light , seemed to be protruding amiably toward him . " I mean to do something with this , " Swan said . " I mean to let him use it on me . I mean to , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it sounded empty and forlorn , a voice heard through a tunnel . " I mean to . . . " " Yes , " said the deputy , nodding . " Yes . You put that away , now . You 're all right . " " But I walked all this way in , " Swan said . He had not the strength to pull back from the deputy , who was gripping his wrist rather tightly between his thick , lard-colored fingers ; sop196Swan looked , perhaps for sympathy , around at the Negro boy , who was watching them both in openmouthed astonishment , still clumsily embracing the bundle of newspapers . " I walked all this way in to see the sheriff . . . " " Yes , " said the deputy . " Yes , . You , there , Chap . Ai n't you done with them papers yet ? " The boy looked as though he had been struck neatly across the face . " Mostly done , " he whispered . " See you do it , then , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned only slightly toward the boy . " Get along . What do you expect we pay you for , to stand around all day ? Huh ? " When the boy did not reply the deputy turned farther , the cords of his neck standing out stiffly . The boy , however , was not looking at him ; he seemed instead to be transfixed by something . Then he ducked his head a little and laughed . " What 's wrong with you , there ? " the deputy said . " Huh ? What 's so funny now ? " The boy stopped laughing at once . He looked at the deputy . " Just that-there hair , " he said softly . " What ? " " That hair , " he said . " Such a color like that . " The deputy must have been staring at him . " Well , yes , " he said . " You go on , now . Ai n't you got a lot to do this afternoon ? Ai n't you ? What do you mean , standin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somethin ' ? This boy come in here to see me ; he ai n't got nothin ' to do with you . . . " " I come for the sheriff , " Swan said suddenly . The deputy turned back to Swan . " Now you here , boy , you get a holt of yourself . You stop this-here tremblin ' like you are an ' get a holt of yourself . I would n't wonder you were gettin ' sick , the way you act  --  might be comin ' down with the heatexhaustionfever . . . " He spoke so calmly and with such cool , nearly austere dignity that Swan was unable for a momentp197even to reply ; he did not know what to say , he was hardly able to raise his eyes to the man 's face . " Maybe  --  maybe you ai n't the deputy , " he said . " Maybe I got in the wrong place . . " The man still held onto Swan 's wrist , but he leaned away with a neat , almost agile movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he moved , Swan saw that the office was empty now save for them . The boy had gone ; the screen door at the back of the room was now swingly slowly and almostaimlessly shut . " Now , boy , if this helps you any , " the man said , " if you 'd just get it straight that it do n't matter about him , it do n't matter one bit .. . Here , " he said . He had stuck the badge onto his shirt , on the sagging pocket ; it was a little tarnished and in the poor light did not even seem metallic , but there was no mistaking it just the same . " If this helps you any . I s'pose a boy like yourself , a country boy an ' all , you got to have things spelt out kind of plain for you . " Swan was looking at the badge . " Well , that 's it , " he said , with an air of agreement . " That 's it , all right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what there was for him to say next . He had no idea at all , he simply waited for the words to come and arrange themselves . " Maybe I better be goin ' on back , now , my pa might be waitin ' . . . " " Sure , boy . You go on back home , " the deputy said . He released Swan 's wrist . Only now could Swan begin to appreciate the strength of the man 's fingers . He gazed at his wrist in a slow , dreamy way ; he believed he could even see the imprint of the man 's fingers in his flesh . " Any time you 're back in town you can come over if you want , " the deputy was saying . " You ai n't in anybody 's way . Most of the time there ai n't nothin ' doin ' , but you never can tell with a sheriff office like this . .. , . You just come on over any time you want . "  |p198Some  time ago in Eden County the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he declared to the sheriff , and to his own wife and man-grown sons , and to every person he encountered for a month , white or black , to be his second period  --  his new period , he would say queerly , sucking at his upper lip with a series of short , damp , deliberate noises . He was thirty-eight when he had the trouble with Bethl'em Aire , he would say , thirty-eight and with three man-grown sons behind him ; but he had had his eyes opened only on that day ;  |p199he  was born on that day ; he meant to keep it fresh in his mind . When the long winter finally ended and the roads were thick and shapeless with mud , shot with sunlight , the Negro Bethl'em and his memory had both disappeared from Eden County , and  --  to everyone 's relief , especially his wife 's  --  from Murray 's mind too . But up until then , in those thick , gray , mist-choked days , he did keep what had happened fresh in his mind ; memoriesof the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of his great experience , seemed to recur again and again in his thoughts . He and the Negro Bethl'em , whom he had arrested out in a field , had been caught in a snowstorm driving in to the sheriff 's office . At the wheel , Murray had muttered that he had never seen such snow ; and every time he exploded into a brief , harsh , almost painful series of curses , the snowstorm outside the car grew thicker . Murray was a big proud man , with eyes that jutted a little out of his head , as if with rage , and these he turned to the swirling world beyond his windshield while the Negro sat silent and shivering beside him , his own eyes narrowed , discreet , while Murray swore at the storm . Never had a man been so tricked by the weather , so confused by his own country , as Murray thought himself to be ; and it seemed to him too , though he pushed the idea right away , that he was lost and would never find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office they would be waiting for him , the windows warm and steamy , the men sitting around the stove with their legs outstretched , smoking , surely talking of him  --  of this queer bad luck that had come to Murray , the best deputy , the only man beside Walpole himself good enough to bring in Bethl'em Aire . Murray grimaced to himself at the picture . He saw the men , and he saw in turn their picture of him : Murray with his big , proud shoulders , his big hands , but no common farmer either , no common country farmer ; Murrayp200with his felt hat stuck tight on his head , the filthy band fitting right on his forehead as if it had grown there , his black felt hat , like a symbol of something , or like a pot overturned above his face . So his face would emerge beneath the hat broad and tanned , but raw-looking too , stung by the December wind , and his eyes blinking and squinting as if there were a glare . He would have on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff and looking from a distance like wood or iron ; always braced as if in a wind or just emerging out of one ; he would have on his leather gloves as fine and gleaming as new leather could be , his big boots dully gleaming with grease or melted snow ; and these he would kick against the stove , ceremoniously , grunting , first the left foot and then the right , with his chin lowered so upon his chest , or down to where the big coat seemed to swell out from his body . No sheriff 's deputy carried himself like Murray , no country son of them had his look , or his voice , or could be trusted to bring in such a one as Bethl'em Aire . . . . But sitting in the cold car , Murray felt the vision slip away . He was looking at the snow , the crazy whirling of flakes . Not that these seemed infinite , or even numerous  --  they looked insteadsimply like a constant shuffling and reshuffling of the same flakes , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the glare of the headlights . On either side they fell away into a mass of gray , like a cloud . Murray grinned and swore , spitting at the storm . Now and then he saw stiff , shocked trees along the roadside , bare things as naked in the cold as if someone had peeled all their bark off with a jackknife , peeled it off and tossed it up to be sucked away by the wind . It was then that Murray noticed the Negro Bethl'em staring at the trees too . " This wo n't last long , " Murray said . " It 's just a freak storm , and a freak cold too , and you know it as well as me. "  |p201It  was good to hear his own voice again . He went on : " When I lived farther up north there were storms there ! That 's where they really were  --  snow up past the first-floor windows of houses , there  --  and my father would have to dig his way out to see about the stock . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! People who were alone . . . " He wondered why his conversation had taken that turn . His voice had simply gone on that way by itself . He waited for the prisoner to say something ; but they only sat for a minute or two in silence , listening to the wind . Then Murray laughed , harshly and humorlessly , and found himself continuing : " They would n't find them till maybe a month afterwards , " he said , "  --  old people who lived all alone , old men , frozen to death in their homes . There was one caught in a schoolhouse , one old man ; he 'd sleep there to save wood at home . He got caught in the schoolhouse when a storm come on and he could n't get home , and burned all he could  --  books and desks and all . . . That old man , I remember him , I remember him coming around , asking to shoe horses in the summer . . . " Murray wondered at himself , at the odd sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was it , then . A man caught so all alone in the winter , that would happen to him  --  then or now , up there or right here , anywhere . A man is got to stick with others , doing how they do , their laws , obeyingtheir laws , living with them  --  not off by himself , with his own laws . . . The ones that think diffrent are the ones get kilt  --  or we bring them in to get . . . " He stopped talking and drove on a while , silent , impressed with his own words and also with the peculiar feeling he had of the closeness of that old man 's death ; it was just as if it had happened out there in the snowstorm he now faced . Then he shook his mind clear of the thought and decided they ought to stop . " We 'll wait this goddam wind out , " he said . The wind kept on . Before him the road reared out in broken , barep202stretches , as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either side . " Wait it out , " Murray muttered . He had not glanced at his prisoner for some time ; he did not do so now . He knew , and the prisoner knew , that he had been talking to himself . But now he went on to ask , " You know where we are now ? " The question hung in the air between them . Murray looked around in surprise , as if the Negro had spoken to him . The Negro Bethl'em , however , just sat there , as big a man as Murray , his puffed black face turned right to him ; and his eyes , too , small and close together the way Murray supposed a pig 's eyes would be , these were staring right at Murray 's face or maybe at those queer words Murray had just heard himself say . Bethl'em , a well-known country Negro , well known up and down the road , who worked for hire in the summertime , hay mowing and such , now looked to Murray no longer like himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else  --  all hard and cold and ageless , as if he had been staring at Murray or someone like him , just that way , with those pig 's eyes , for centuries . Then he began to cough  --  not bothering to turn his head aside , coughing in a wracking , terrifying , almost spiteful way . " Yah , you would n't know , would you , " Murray said . He felt his cold cheeks tighten . " Cough your goddam heart out , your black tonsils out , then . Go on . " He drove on , sitting near the edge of the seat , his knees apart and rubbing against the steeringwheel . Murray stared at the storm , his face distorted with the effort of peering ahead . " There  --  something over there , " he said . The prisoner had stopped coughing . Murray pressed the car forward slowly . A ridge of land to his left seemed to fly right up out of the ground , a giant swelling of white like the side of a mountain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned if there ai n't . . . I know it , I seen it enough times . " He spit out his words , almost as if he expected the garage to appear as soon as he spoke , as if his words would make it ap-203 The Fine White Mist of Winterpear . " It must be here somewhere , " he said a little more quietly . " Out here somewhere . . . " Next to Murray the Negro began coughing again . Murray stared at him for a moment ; then he looked away . " Are you all right ? " he said . Bethl'em did not answer . " Most likely getting sick , " Murray went on harshly , even angrily , as if he were talking to the snow . " Running all that ways without a coat , like a goddam fool nigger , . . . Well , you cough all you like . I 'm getting out here . " He had stopped the car , or allowed it to stop , or allowed the wind to stop it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . I think there 's a building here . " He switched off the ignition but left the lights on . He could barely open the door of the car , and when the first gust of wind hit his face he grunted with surprise and looked back at Bethl'em . He saw the Negro sitting there , watching him . Murray carried the picture of the man with him as he made his way  --  bent awkwardly against the wind , against the terrific onslaught of snow  --  around the front of the car and off the frozen road . Now the snow seemed to mock Murray : Murray with all his pride , all his strength , stumbling first in one directionand then stopping , slyly perhaps , and turning in another , now walking as if he had really caught sight of something . When he finally found himself actually looking at two shapes , oblong and upright with long narrow drifts extending out behind them like angels ' wings , he could only gape at them in confusion . Then he saw the dim flicker of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stared at it , shielding his big face with his hands . The wind flung pulsing clouds of snow , like handfulsof fine hard sand , against his face . While helping Bethl'em out of the car and to the building he had just discovered , Murray had to grab hold of him once to keep him from falling  --  the ground underfoot was ice  --  and stood for a moment with his feet far apart , bracing both ofp204them : the prisoner , with his wrists tied behind him , could not help himself . Murray put his arms tightly around the man 's shoulders and in this way , panting , with both their heads bowed , the line of snow slashing at their foreheads as if they were no more than the gasoline pumps they could now make out , they made their way through to the little wasteland of shelter in front of the garage . Murray slammed at the door with his foot . He bent to look through the glass of the door , and despite his blurred vision was able to see two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a lamp of some sort . Muttering with impatience , he saw one of the men advancing slowly and hesitantly toward the door . When the door opened , Murray pushed Bethl'em inside and then stepped in himself to a warm surge of air and to a startling scene  --  how startling only Murray himself could have said , and yet it could not really have been a surprise to Murray , who knew this country so well . The man in overalls who had opened the door  --  a man whose black-and-red plaid shirt was unexpectedlyclean  --  was a Negro . And at the back of the room another Negro sat up straight , staring at them with the look of a rabbit or chipmunk or any small animal who believes himself camouflaged by the foliage around him and not really visible , and thus has an air of absurdity about him . Murray , who was still a little shaken by his efforts outdoors , turned to close the door ; and for an instant he stared at the frosted glass , and the sense of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving him a little weak . Then he turned back . " We only come to sit out this storm , " he said . The first Negro was staring at him and , past him , at Bethl'em , with a look of muffled recognition . " You c'n come in here , " the Negro said slowly . " By the stove an ' get warm . . . I was . . I was scairt for a minute who was out there . " It was warmer at the back of the garage . The other Negro , a205 The Fine White Mist of Winteryounger man , watched them . He was sitting in a swivel chair before a large office desk , an old-fashioned , ridiculous piece of furniture with scratches and initials on its surface . The older Negro went to the side of the desk and picked up a screwdriver , idly . He looked back at Murray over his shoulder . " We thank you for this , " Murray said , nodding brusquely . He had begun to feel oddly warm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed he recognized vaguely  --  but at the same time not really performing for them at all , but for his own satisfaction , his own delight , Murray began ceremoniouslyto unbutton his coat . He had taken off one of his fine leather gloves , and this he now stuck in his pocket , as if it were an ornament , and then with one glove on and one glove off he began to unbutton the big plastic buttons of the coat , frowning , his face distorted with concentration . The Negroes watched him . When he had pushed the last button out of its buttonholehe sighed and straightened his shoulders and made a gesture  --  evenMurray could not have said how he did it  --  so that the older Negro gave a slight start and came over to take Murray'scoat . Murray watched him carry it off gingerly in his arms and then hang it on a peg , brushing snow off it , yet doing that gingerly too , as if he knew he was being closely watched . With his right hand Murray took hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first winter he was a deputy and began to unwind it , again ceremoniously , while the others watched . This too he handed to the Negro , who hung it by the coat . Murray was about to take off his hat , but he only touched it ; for some reason it suddenly struck him that it might look better on , though it was wet . Then he turned with ceremony to Bethl'em and , while the others stared , began to brush some of the snow off the man , . " Stand by the stove , " he said . Bethl'em turned to it almost blindly . The stove was an old one , made of iron , a large , squat , ancient stove that gave forth a low roaringp206murmur and glowed , in spots , a hard-looking yellow . Murray patted Bethl'em 's shoulders and untied his wrists , and he saw now that the cord had cut into the man 's flesh , that it had made raw red lines in his skin . " Look at that , " Murray said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length . " Never even told me it was too tight . " He faced the two Negroes boldly , as if they were somehow involved in this . They were watching him , looking at his uniform . They had evidently both been sitting at the desk , on either side of an open drawer with a piece of stiff cardboard over it , playing cards ; some of the cards now lay inside the drawer , blown there when the door was opened . The fingerworn , soiled surfaces , the drunken-looking , glazed faces of the kings and queens and jacks , seemed to be gazing idly at Murray . " Expect we could offer them some coffee , " the young Negro said . " It 's a purely cold night out . " Murray 's mouth watered . But no one moved ; and he caught his confusion quickly enough to keep it from showing . The older Negro , who stood picking at the desk halfheartedly with the screwdriver , as if he thought he should look busy , said , " If there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ai n't up to these new cars . We just give out gas , now . " " No trouble with the car , " Murray said . " That 's luck for you , " the other Negro said . He and the older man  --  Murray supposed they were brothers  --  laughed shortly . The young man leaned back in the swivel chair . He took a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket . " Ai n't much luck for your friend you got there , though . " Again he and his brother laughed . " Say . Ai n't goin ' to tie us up with that , are you ? " Murray saw that he was still holding the cord . He shrugged his shoulders and tossed it to the floor . The brothers were grinningidentically . At the stove Bethl'em stood with his arms out as if to embrace the heat ; his eyes were averted . " That had usp207purely scairt for a minute , " the young Negro said . He was lightinga cigarette . His movements were slow and self-conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You , boy . I expect you 'd like a cigarette too . " He was grinning at Murray , showing his teeth ; but when he extended the pack it was to Bethl'em . Murray , watching cautiously out of the corner of his eye , saw the prisoner 's fingers take a cigarette . " What 's he done to get himselfarrested so ? " the young Negro said . " He hurt some white folks somewheres ? " The young man 's chest seemed swollen when he sat down again , leaning back precariously in the swivel chair ; and now his brother had begun to smile too , looking up from the scratches he was making on the desk . Alarmed , Murray realized that not only did they look alike but they seemed now to be sharing the same expression : a sly , knowing , inviting look . The young man smoked his cigarette . " Maybe you ca n't talk none , " he said . Murray blinked at his words . " We got to let you in here , or anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . But I expect we already know what he done , anyhow . That Bethl'em Aire , there , there was talking all up an ' down here about him . . . . He never left off fightin ' too early . Ai n't that right ? " Murray glanced at the prisoner , who stood with his eyes lowered , as if he were listening to something forbidden . His face , though , looked as if it had thawed . " What they goin ' to do to him ? " the older Negro asked suddenly . Murray stiffened . " A matter of the law , " he said . " What they goin ' to do ? " Murray stared at them . The brothers met his stare equally , easily , like burlesques of himself , or like negatives of himself mocking him . " Seems that takin ' a man in to somethin ' like he 's goin ' to get , there , an ' not even know for sure what it is  --  that ain'tp208the way to do , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You think that 's the way to do ? Takin ' a man in , an ' him sure to be kilt for it . . . " " Wait , " Murray said . His voice sounded quite young . But what most surprised him was that whatever concern he felt , whatever alarm , was not for himself but for Bethl'em . The word evidently came as a pleasant surprise , however , to the young Negro , who now lounged in the chair with the cigarette in his teeth . " That sheriff Walpole knows me fine , an ' he might of come through here an ' tole me somethin ' , " he said . " Yes . He might of tole me somethin ' about Bethl'em . An ' I surely would n't want to trade no place with that boy there . " Murray glanced from the prisoner 's strong back to the brothers . The brothers had drawn closer together ; the older man , standing , was leaning against the desk ; the younger sat up slowly in the creaking chair . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't easy to consider a man that 's alive right now , " he said grandly , as if beginning a speech , " an ' is goin ' to be dead in a time . Why , that-there blood goin ' through him right now , only think  --  only think how it 'll get all cold an ' hard like grease in the cold . . . . How a man can go from alive to dead in such a time ! Not just black but white too or any color . Ai n't that so ? A thing no more'n thattherescrewdriver , for puttin ' in screws an ' pickin ' around here an ' scratchin ' the ice off the window , why , set up against any man 's forehead an ' pushed in only a bit  --  any man at all , why . . . " Murray felt his face burn , and he felt something  --  at first quite small , like a pinprick  --  touch coldly at his heart . When he looked around to the prisoner he saw the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove . Murray could no longer stand still but began to shift his weight from one foot to the other , grimacing as if in impatience at the storm . Butp209when he spoke it was not of the storm . His words seemed to explode from him . " But I helped him , " he said suddenly . " I did . I found him half a mile out in a field trying to run up a hill that was all drifted , and it was sundown , dark in a hour , . . . . And this storm coming . . . He would have died there . " Now the young man laughed . " One place , here or there , anotherplace ; there ai n't much diffrence . " He and his brother laughed quietly . " You , Bethl'em . You see much diffrence ? " Bethl'em did not look around . " He would have got lost in the storm anyway , " Murray said . " Lost and frozen , all alone . What good is it for a man all alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did that just to get away from me . That 's what I ca n't get used to , " he said strangely , " them always running away . Goddam fools , do n't know what 's for their own good , what 's all thought up to help them ! They do n't understandanything but how hungry they are , they live by their stomach , you ca n't talk to them for five minutes explaining any law  --  about deer or bass or anything  --  without their eyes going all around to something else , something over your shoulder : a bird in a tree , or the tree itself , or the sky . . . " " Hey , what 's that ? " the young man said . " What 's that you 're sayin ' ? " Murray was breathing hard . He felt more words crowding and jumbling inside him . " Somethin ' about a bird in a tree , " the older brother said . " An ' the sky too . Bethl'em , you hear that ? You s'pose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huh ? Where you 're goin ' ? " When Bethl'em turned they all must have thought he was crying . Two almost even trickles of water had run down his face . But it was only from the snow in his hair , and he licked his lips and spat and glared at them . He held the cigarette without smoking it . " I got nothin ' to say , " he muttered . " Got nothin ' ? Why , you better have ! " the young man saidp210gaily . " What you think they 're bringin ' you in for ? Why , to talk , Bethl'em , to talk  --  you got to answer questions polite . You know that sheriff ? Do n't you s'pose he 's got things to ask you ? He 'll hit right on that trouble with that-there man at the saloon , you know , an ' how you done somethin ' with your knife you ought n't of ; an ' you ai n't goin ' to like it , no , but you got to answer polite for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing cards , which had been blown back into the desk drawer . He picked them up one by one , nodding , clicking his tongue as if in agreement with something . " Yes , " he said . " You got to answer polite . An ' you know what , Bethl'em ? You know what ? " The young man 's expression was inscrutable , serious , and knowing , all at once , and he sat nodding at the dirty cards , picking them up and inspecting them , putting them into a pile . " You know what ? " He looked right past Murray to the prisoner . " There ai n't goin ' to be a person at that trial , later , only maybe the wife of the guy you cut , an ' his kids or somethin ' , no , not a person , sheriff or judge or nobody , that ai n't goin ' to be glad for what you done . They 'll all be pleased fine with it . " He nodded again , looking at Murray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards , kings and queens , whose eyes , like those of the Negroes , were turned toward him . " Ai n't that right , mister deppity ? You tell him . Ai n't that right ? " Murray turned away ; he walked blindly toward the front of the garage . " Ai n't that right ! " the young man cried ; there was joy in his voice . " Ai n't it ! An ' nobody here ai n't explained the diffrence between lettin ' a man die a good way , a clean way , by himself out in the snow , in his own land , an ' bringin ' him in so they can make a fuss out of it  --  a show out of it . " His words tumbled about themselves . " Yes , " he said loudly , " that ai n't been tole to me yet . Or to Bethl'em either . He ai n't got muchp211time to be tole it in . If you 're goin ' to take a man in to be kilt you better explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm himself . He stared out the window , but his hand was on his pistol . Most of all he was conscious of Bethl'em 's eyes on him , on his back ; and he could feel his heart cringing inside him , in shame , a shame that was all mixed up , that had no direction in which to go . The best deputy , Murraythought , the best one of them , as good almost as Walpole himself . . . And he saw a picture of himself suddenly : tall and proud , with his hat stuck so tightly on his head , his broad face sick and pale , like uncooked dough , just a mockery of the old Murray , the one everyone along the road knew , Murray with his hard chin and his sunburned , wind-blown good looks . . . . Outside the snowstorm had thinned a little , the wind had nearly stopped ; there was a bright moon somewhere that lit up everything with a delicate whiteness , a crystalline whiteness . It was so clean , so white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the breath . " A man let loose in all this cold would n't last , " the young man said loudly . " He 'd walk off by himself further an ' further , all alone , an ' never need for any white folks to do it to him . Any man is got a right . . . " Murray stared out at the great banks of white , toppled and slanted in the dark . Beyond his surface paralysis , he felt something else , something peculiar  --  a sense , maybe , of the familiarityof the landscape . He had watched such scenes as this almost every night in the winters of his childhood farther north , when he used to crouch at his bedroom window in the dark and peer out at the night , at the snow falling or the fine whirling mist , which held no strangeness , he felt , except what people thought strange in it  --  the chaos of something not yet formed . .. . Outside the garage the earth seemed to roll out of sight , like something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolation not only of himself but of the prisoner and the other Negroes as well ; and he knew too that the time was approaching when he would have to do something by himself  --  not with the sheriff behind him , or with any laws to back him up , but by himself alone . When Murray turned back , his heart was pounding . Bethl'em had straightened ; he now stood taller than any of them . He was sucking in his breath slowly , moving his eyes slowly about Murray 's face and behind his head as if it were all the same thing , doing something with his hands  --  rubbing his wrists  --  and grinding out the cigarette on the floor . The brothers had not moved ; they grinned toward Murray , their smiles fixed and expectant , and the younger one went on quietly , proddingly , " Now you , Bethl'em , you maybe got your only chance now . We 're behind you . We ai n't goin ' to stand by to see such things happen  --  we ai n't now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I seen ridin ' around in the back seat of Walpole 's old car enough times , he knows what 's good for him , he ai n't goin ' to interfere  --  he ai n't ! " The young man 's arms came loose . " You go on now , Bethl'em , " he said . " You go on ! You 're a man , an ' you got your right to . " Murray waited . Both he and the prisoner were breathing strongly , almost at the same time , their big chests taut , filling with air and then falling ; they were standing stiffly , rigidly , waiting , their eyes tied up together as if they were counting the steps between one another . But Bethl'em 's look was so unflinching , so intense , so knowing of what was right , what was just , that Murraythought he could not bear it any longer  --  that look pierced him like a sliver of glass , and he looked away . Now the young Negro 's chanting voice , even his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed only familiar , only right , exactly what he would have expected , almost what he should have said himself . " You are a man , " the young Negrop213said , " an ' there 's no law here  --  not here , not tonight . Where is there any law ? Where is it ? Or any one of us better'n another ? All of us caught here in a storm , a blizzard , who 's to say if there 's anything left but us ? Any laws ? Any of sheriff ? You surely got a right to your own life . You got a right . You got a right to . . . " Neither Murray nor the prisoner had moved . They seemed locked by their eyes , as if in an embrace , with the air swelling about them , around their ears , so that Murray was sure that in a moment it would explode into him , deafening him and crushinghis brain . Then he saw something he did not at first believe : the young Negro now standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , . But there the young man stood , nodding brightly , grinning incredibly , with one eye shut tight and wrinkled . Murray gaped ; he sucked at the air , at its tremendous pressure . " You . . . you . . . " he stammered . His fingers were so tight on the revolver handle that he could not move them . " You ! What are you . . . ? What . . Just as Bethl'em was about to move , the young Negro and his brother began laughing . To Murray , even their teeth seemed to laugh , and he felt their laughter tear through him , just as he knew it must be tearing through Bethl'em . " Look at that Bethl'em , now ! " the young man cried . His delight so shook him that he jerked like a puppet , his arms loose , his shoulders rocking . " Just look ! Here he thinks he 's goin ' somewhere ! He ai n't never goin ' to get along with no white men  --  ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders relaxed just a little . His face stayed tight like a mask , staring straight at Murray 's shamed face . " Now , you , Bethl'em , now , " the young man said , dancing around , " do n't you get mad at me . I ai n't done a thing . It ai n't a fault of mine you come to believe so much ! " Murray went to the prisoner and took his arm . He could notp214look at the man 's face , so he looked at his collar instead and at the wet hair that grew so far down his neck . Murray stood there for a minute or so . Then he said , " We 're leaving now . The storm 's let up . " Murray could hear nothing but the prisoner'sslow , even breath and the almost noiseless laughter of the brothers . " You , Bethl'em , " he said . " You go on out to the car . You get in and wait . " He stopped for a moment . " Go on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Murray did not watch him , nor did he look at the brothers . At first he did not know where to look ; he did not know what to do ; he could not , right now , even think beyond the terrible shame he had seen . He felt weak and sickened at the thought of it . Then he turned briskly ; he stiffened his shoulders ; he took his red scarf very carefully off the peg and began winding it around his neck . It took him some time to dress . The young Negro kept on , a little louder now : " That Bethl'em 's a big man , a good big man , I known him too long a time already , . A big man up an ' down this road ! Hey ! " Murray finished buttoning his coat . He did not hurry . He kept his attention on himself ; he kept his attention on putting on his gloves . When he was ready to go he knew there was something left wrong , unfinished ; but he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was crowded so . " An ' you tell that sheriff , too , " the young man was saying . " Will you ? You tell him . " The laughter had suddenly drained out of his face . " Mister deppity  --  wait . . . Wait a minute ! " Murray was staring at him . Then he saw the cord on the floor ; he bent over slowly , picked it up , and put it in his pocket . He went to the door . The young man hurried along behind him . He took hold of Murray 's arm . " You , mister , " he said . " You tell the sheriff how I did here . You tell him that . An ' how you caught on the game right away an ' played it too . Youp215tell him . He 'll like that . He will . I know that sheriff , he comes out here sometimes . . . . He buys gas here sometimes . . . Murray stared at the man . " That black boy out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is got to have it done to him too . Is he any diffrent ? " The young man spoke quickly and a little shrilly . " Why , there ai n't a one of us ai n't had it done to him , " he said proudly , " an ' ai n't a white man here do n't know it . . . . That 's how it is . An ' him too , him too , he is got to have it done to him too . . . . " He smiled shakily as Murray opened the door and the cold air fell upon them . Murray stepped out . " Wait , wait ! " the young Negro said , pulling at his arm . " Mister , you wait . You tell the sheriff , huh ? Huh ? Will you ? You tell him how I did  --  he 'll laugh  --  you say it was me , here , this garage . . . . He knows me good . . . . Why , look here , mister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his trouser legs , so quickly that Murray had n't time to look away , all the way up to the knee so that Murray could n't fail to see the queer mottled scars . " They sic 'd the dogs on me once , had them chase me for fun down by the crick ; I was n't fifteen then ; they chased me a long ways , I kept tannin ' with them right on my legs an ' somebody tole the sheriff an ' he come to see me himself an ' ast about it , an ' looked sorry , but there could n't be nothin ' done Why , I never needed to knife no man first , did I ? But I had it done , it 's how it is ; I never even thought much on it . So that black boy you got ai n't no diffrent . . . You tell the sheriff . He 'll rememberwhich one I am , he 'll remember me . . . . " Murray let the door close behind him . Crossing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the lights off  --  he thought he could sense the young man leaning against the glass , his arms up and embracing the window . Murray did not look back . The wind pulled at his hat , and he pressed it down tighter . He went around and got in the car , grunting , his body as heavyp216as if he were dragging himself out of water . The air inside the car was frozen and painful . It turned his breath to steam before him . Murray sat quietly , resting , his hands on the steering wheel , looking out at the white world  --  as Bethl'em himself was looking , without speaking  --  and Murray felt the heat of that shame only now begin to cool . A strange , sinister , diffuse shame it was ; it reached out to all of them , touched them all . He saw that the fine white mist of the storm , all its queer , brutal power , its primeval power , had settled , and that all that remainedwere forms of sculptured whiteness , familiar forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would return . But still he sat behind the window tapping his stiffened fingers on it , thinking , knowing that his behavior not only did not puzzleBethl'em but did not even touch upon him . Murray thought that some time before very long , surely in a minute or two , he would again continue on his way.  |p217At  Marty 's that night there was first of all Marty and his girl Stella ; and there was Edgar the blind pianist , a small baby-faced student in the music school ; and Alma and Walt Simmons , who were teaching assistants in English ; and Walt 's best friend , Stevie , who had been Walt 's roommate before his marriage and who now slept in the living room of the Simmons ' three-room apartment and paid half the rent . There was the crowd from the drama school , among them Domna , the star of most university productions , who was blond and harsh/featured and had a loud , self-congratulatory voice ; and her lover , Kelly , who wore disreputable clothes and a short , anemic beard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was the magazine 's editor himself : Gordie Fischer , a Ph.D . candidate in English , smiling and unsmiling , keen and suspicious , who boasted often of his being liked by the venerable old lady of the English department , Miss Stanley , whose influence would be of great value after his graduation . There was Claude Haunsman , thickset and with curly red hair , who looked as if he had lost chunks of weight lately  --  his clothes sagged  --  who directed conversations by heavy use of facial twists and tics and by sudden scatological irrelevancies , who was always invited to parties though he insultedeveryone , including his hosts , and whom it was now consideredtrite to despise . There was even a faculty member : a young man named Cowley from the East , who insisted upon beingaddressed as " Doctor , " drank and hiccuped violently and precariously , and interrupted conversations by seizing people by their arms and saying , " How old do you think I am ? Do I look past twenty-five ? Do I ? " Leo arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and had scrubbed tediously at his face . Watching himself in the mirror as he shaved , he had prepared his expression for his friends : he would appear to them as fresh , happy , perhaps even innocent . But something happened as soon as he let himself in and stared at the confusion in the room before him . His face tightened , the corners of his eyes ached as he strained to see every face , every turned head . His heart tripped absurdly . Then someone touched his arm and he turned with relief , with breathless anticipation  --  only to find himself staring in the face of the instructor , Cowley , whom he hardly knew . " Do you think I 'm older than twenty-five ? " Cowley asked . He was assessing Leo rapidly , trying to calculate his age . " What 's your opinion ?  |p219I  mean your candid opinion . What would you think if you just saw me somewhere ? " Leo escaped and found Marty in the kitchen , where he stood drinking beer , his back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests . His eyes flinched when he saw Leo . " I 'm sure as hell sorry about it , " he said . But Leo laughed ; he tried to surpriseboth Marty and himself . " Forget it , " he said . " I did n't come over to cry about it . And thanks for your help . Again . " Marty sucked at his beer as if he was reluctant to put down the bottle and resume conversation . Then he said , " Well , Leo . Stella called some friends of yours , and they had n't seen her  --  I do n't think they were lying . And we went through the library ourselves , just in case . No luck . I do n't know where she is this time . " Marty was big and muscular , with a plain , broad face , and the queer precision of his sentences , the slowness of his speech , always surprised Leo . Leo groped to change the subject but could only say , staring at the floor , " I 'm grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do without you and Stella . " He could not lookup at Marty 's pained eyes . When Leo returned to the party , pressing the cold bottle against his forehead , he saw Stella turning pages at the piano for Edgar and laughing hilariously at the joke . He pushed his way through the loose , idling groups and joined them . " Leo ! How the hell are you ? " Stella cried . She seized Leo and hugged him . The little man at the piano was playing Ravel  --  soft , thin , effeminate pieces no one listened to  --  but he sat in a veritable sweat of attention to his art , his eyes closed as if musing upon a secret delight . Leo squeezed Stella with more enthusiasm than he felt . She smelled of beer and perfume and deodorant : a short , lazily round girl , with dark-rimmed glasses and an outfit that was all black , even down to the black socks she worep220without shoes . She was a post-doctoral student in chemistry who had turned down offers involving real money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school with Marty while he gradually completed his dissertation . " You heard from her yet ? " she whispered . Leo 's hands came loose . " I 'll try not to break down , " he said . " After all , this is n't the first time she 's pulled it . But thanks  --  thanks for what you and Marty did , " he said seriously . " Forget it . " She was dragging him somewhere . " Hey , Gordie ! Gordie ! You ready for another one yet ? " she shouted . Gordie Fischer , sprawled in one of the sagging formless chairs Stella had bought for the apartment , waved at them . " Always ready , " he said . To avoid Gordie  --  and he did it rather clumsily  --  Leo backed against the wall and looked around the room , as if there were someone there he must meet . But the peculiar thing was that , though he had known nearly everyone for years and they were perfectly familiar to him , they were also , oddly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were the Simmonses and their perpetual friend Stevie , about whom vulgarstories circulated ; they were chatting happily together in a corner , like children . There was Claude ; there was Domna , roaring at a joke so that Leo could see her wet tongue even from some distance ; and there was Gordie , flushed with anger because Leo had ignored him . Leo looked idly around the room : It was small and would have been oppressive had it not been for the collection of cheap prints Marty and Stella had put up on each wall . There were exotic masks on one wall  --  three in a row . One of them reminded Leo of himself : a thin , drawn , dissipated face , with a sardonic grin implying a constantlypresent sense of irony that had choked off all other emotions , even self-pity . There were green dime-store drapes , madep221of something resembling fish net , and Japanese-looking vases on top of the piano , which was an old upright antique crowded back into a corner . The pretentious modern furniture Stella had insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty wallpaper and bare floor . On the floor along one wall there was a row of records in their cardboard covers  --  maybe twelve feet of them . Leo always stared at them in angry dismay . How many hundreds of dollars had gone into their purchase ? Yet Marty came to him for money regularly , and Stella repaid it with money from her father , proudly if impishly . Leo thought suddenly of Marty and Stella and of the party  --  of the many parties they had given and he had attended during these last four years  --  and then of his wife , and for a moment he felt real shock . What would become of them all ? Would leaving college jolt them overnight into becoming American citizens , thinking of house payments and cars and church  --  for the children , of course  --  and supermarket stamps to paste in books ? With whom would Stella live when Marty finally threw her over , leaving in triumph with his degree , headed for a small respectableliberal arts college somewhere ? Who would move into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untapedfrom the wall ? And Leo 's marriage ? He felt the cold dawning terror of one who needs love so badly , so blindly , that all memory of a life prior to love is confused and unreal  --  a child 's life , a half life . He had been drinking at home , alone in the kitchen , before coming to the party ; he had reassured himselfthat his wife would come to it  --  she had always liked Stella . And once before , when she had been missing for a whole afternoon , it turned out that she had been talking with Stella , and she had called him to come get her . Leo 's glance happened to fall on Gordie Fischer , who was now sitting with a girl on his lap , a big , splendid , black-haired girl from the drama school ; he was mussing her hair furiouslyp222with both hands . Leo watched him for lack of anything better to do . " What the hell are you looking at ? " Gordie said . He sounded drunk . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to get up  --  his sudden hatred shocked Leo  --  but the girl grabbed him , squealing , and both fell slowly backward , upsetting the chair and tumbling without ceremony to the floor . " Oh , you are crazy ! Just like they say ! " the girl cried . They fought in a frenzy , fists waving , and were pulled apart . Marty took over , helping the girl to her feet . " I 'm all right , " Gordie said , stung by laughter . " Got ta go to the bathroom . I 'm all right . Leggo , you , " he said to Leo . " What the hell . " He left the room . Discomforted by the scene , as if it had meant something , Leo went back to the kitchen . A girl and a man sat at the table in the dark , whispering . A pulse throbbed in Leo 's forehead before he turned on the light ; but the girl was a stranger . He got another bottle of beer and stood at the sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for some time . When he turned , dizzily , he saw that the couple had left . He wondered how long he had stood there . He went back to the party . Three Negro girls had just arrived . They wore imitation fur coats and pastel high heels and greeted friends with roars of laughter . The crowd had grown larger . A girl in dungarees and her date , who wore a tweed jacket with leather patches at the elbows , sat on top of the piano , swinging their legs , nodding in rhythm to a record someone had put on  --  Orfl , it sounded like  --  perhaps to drown out the persistent pianist . The music crashed and throbbed above the verbal din . The blind man still sat devotedlyat the piano , joined now by one of the Negro women , who had her arm around his neck and was staring past him at the crowd , nodding to his music indifferently , for the look of it . Sweat glistened on her broad forehead.  |p223Crowded  together on an easy chair sat Claude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themes , trying to make notations on the papers , which he had placed on an arm of the chair . The point of his pencil , however , kept jabbing through the paper . Claude did not glance up but said gaily , " The stupid am what they am , every miserable semester ! " " Is that an original revelation ? " Leo asked . " Darling , " said Claude , purring , " if I were you I would not make qualitative judgments on anyone else . You are not the man for it . " " What does that mean ? " Leo said . He felt surprisingly angry . By now he was accustomed to Claude  --  everyone was  --  yet something in the man 's gross , contented expression evoked real hatred in Leo . The girl  --  who wore her hair piled on top of her head in an elaborate hair-do vaguely suggesting the eighteenth century , and contrasting with the pallor of her face and with her plain , loose dress and her stringy body  --  clapped Claude on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " That 's unfair . That 's exces-sive . " " I ca n't always resist being unfair , " Claude said pompously . Leo wanted so badly to pour his beer out onto Claude 's tightcurledred locks that for a moment he actually saw himself do it  --  saw Claude 's astonished face . But the instant passed , and he did not move . Just then there was a commotion at the door . In came Jason Howard , a popular Negro graduate student in speech , carrying coats before him . Cries went up , " Jason ! Look who 's here ! " By the time Leo could get over to Jason , the big Negro had deposited the coats somewhere and was clapping his hands in a furious effort to keep time with the music . He had two girls with him , as usual : his regular girl , a white girl with long , straight , listless black hair , a graduate student in art who wasp224rumored to be brilliant ; and a new girl  --  a young , beautiful girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She teetered on very high heels , gold-colored ones , and her stockings , too , were apparently tinted gold . She wore a white wool dress , very short , very small  --  the girl herself was very small  --  and her wrist was weighed down by golden bracelets ( one of them looked as if it might be a high-school charm bracelet ) . She was an undergraduate , probably a freshman , and would have to be returned to her dormitory by a certain hour . The other girl , in flat shoes , would be of use to Jason afterward  --  she had no special hours  --  and so could bide her time , making wise , sardonic faces . " Leo , boss ! " Jason roared . He liked to speak in a caricature of Negro dialect , mutilating his vowels and his grammar . He shook Leo 's hand as if they were being televised . " My best white-folks friend ! If it ai n't him himself ! Why , Leo , baby , " he cried , " I ai n't seen you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Is you taking that grant they gave you for serious ? " Leo laughed weakly . Though he was often displeased by Jason 's fatuous , temporary attentions , he really liked the man . He was a big , tall , handsome Negro , dressed in tweeds , shoes shining with gallantry , who boasted that he would never make love to a Negro girl . " Them 's black trash ! " he would laugh , rolling his eyes in disdain . " A bit like mud  --  ol ' Marse Lawrence said that hisself , an ' if he do n't know about it nobody does ! " Now he pawed Leo affectionately , dragging him to face the first of his girls . Leo had forgotten her name , and she sensed it . She said thinly , " Well , we 've got a lot of drinking to do to catch up with you . " Jason was about to introduce Leo to the new girl , but the girl suddenly clapped her hands and jumped toward him herself . " Why , Mr. Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was one of his students . " Mr. Scott , do n't you know me ? 225 The Expense of SpiritDo n't you really ? " As Leo stared , embarrassed , a name came slowly to mind . " Miss Edwards ? " he said . She seized his arm in her excitement . " Oh , is n't this a coincidence ! Is n't this a coincidence ! I never thought I would move in the same social circles with the faculty ! I never dreamed of it ! " People standing nearby laughed softly in derision . Someone muttered " Faculty ! " and someone else , " Poor old Leo ! " There was an undercurrent of laughter . Leo wanted to put his hand over the girl 's mouth , turn and shout at the others : " She 's beautiful ! " He wanted to insult them and reject them . " At least she 's beautiful ! " he would cry . But he only stood in a sweat of embarrassment . Jason , with his infallible instinct , put his arms around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she a princess ! " he cried . " Thinkin ' they let the faculty teach ones young as her . Honey , it 's dirtcheaplabor that teaches you  --  ai n't they ' splained that in the catalogue ? " The laughter rose again , but Leo was relieved . He laughed with the others . " She just do n't know the ways of the world yet , " Jason crooned . The girl disengaged herself from him with a vague , still smile , . " I suppose I do n't know much , " she said archly but with a hint of satisfaction . She patted her hair as if she were asking them to consider it . It was splendid , Leo thought  --  a light , shining blond , curling out perfectly from her face and foreheadto a mass of thick waves . She looked like one of those serene , expressionless faces he sometimes saw on fashionmagazinecovers , staring vacuously out at him from newsstand shelves . It was a miracle that her face could register expression of any sort . Its look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize you at first , " he said , indicating her hair , her dress , with a vague wave of his hand . The girl 's expres-226 By the North Gatesion melted with pleasure ; she lifted her small shoulders and giggled . Leo swallowed hard . " I just had my seventeenth birthday , " she said . " It was today . I mean yesterday . For it 's midnight now , is n't it ? " She tugged at Jason 's arm so he would hear . A number of people , attracted by Jason , drifted toward them . " They called me from Albany . I make my home in Albany , . I talked to my baby sister ! " She was being examined closely as she spoke . Someone handed her a drink ; it looked like vodka  --  Jason always brought his own drinks . She sipped at it quickly and perfunctorilyfor a moment , as if it were medicine . But after a few swallows she seemed to forget it , so lost was she in conversation , in the dazzle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason , looming darkly behind her , grinned and grinned , as if he were showing off an invention of his . Indeed , a little circleestablished itself around them , discreetly , admiringly , leaving a small space on all sides . The girl glowed in the attention . She had a small , delicate face , nicely tanned , with full pink lips and a childish nose and large , thick-lashed blue eyes , outlinedcarefully for the evening in black and shadowed with silver blue . Above her forehead the platinum hair seemed to shine with joy and good health . The bracelets on her arms seemed to ring with delight . " I was attracted to your university , " she said in her childish , formal voice , a precarious balance between sophistication and absurdity , " by an article I read last year . In a magazine . It stated so well the virtues of this university , though Daddy wanted me to stay in the East . When the letter from the registrarcame , do you know what I did ? How silly I was ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were as surprised as she had been . " I cried ! But Mommy told me not to cry . She told me I would make new friends . And I am ! I am !

They sang a song to me at one of the fraternity parties ; I had to stand halfwayup the stairs , and they had candles . About cheeks of rose  --  or eyes of blue  --  something . . . Of course , " she added at once , regarding everyone in wide-eyed splendor , " I do n't like fraternities at all . Not at all . Nor sororities either . I de-pledged my sorority last week . I wo n't join them . I agree with you . You 're absolutely right . I believe in freedom and brotherhood  --  the editorial in the newspaper yesterday . It 's absolutely right . I do n't believe in un-equality . I do n't , really , " she said . She sipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Domna 's boy friend , Kelly . His eyes were wild . " Oh , I do n't ! I do n't ! " the girl cried to him . " You think like I do , do n't you ? I believe in brotherhood and equality and everything  --  everything ! It 's just wonderful ; I 'm so happy here with you all ! " she cried . She appealed to everyone with an embracinggesture , but she could not halt their laughter . Marty put his fingers over his eyes and stuck out his tongue rudely . " Christ , " he said . The girl , looking around at them , smiled hesitantly as if she could not decide how to interpret their grins . She spilled some of her drink onto her hand . At once Jason said , " Tsk ! Tsk ! Little lady , little princessdove ! " He took the glass away from her and kissed her hand . The girl laughed uneasily , trying to turn away . " Ai n't you the cutest thing , though ? We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been turned up in a final attempt to drown out the pianist , and the Orff music  --  savage , persistent , accentedby the shouting of brutal medieval German  --  roared through the room . Leo was excited . He was sick and his tongue felt clammy and he was excited all at once ; and he watched with satisfaction  --  rather than the disgust some showed  --  the sight of the big Negro licking the girl 's hand . He licked her fingers and her long , gold-painted fingernails , one by one . The228 By the North Gategirl made a last attempt to break away , looking with a queer smile around the room and at Leo , and something in her look shamed down the jeering eyes . " Oh , honey ! " Jason said . " You know what you is ? You is my golden fleece ! " Some time later Leo and Miss Edwards were sitting on the floor with Jason behind them . From time to time Marty loomed over them and handed down drinks . A group stood around the piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hear him . " There was this boy in my botany class , and he took me to that darling little beer garden by the Co-op , " Miss Edwards said in a high , shaky voice , " and coming in the door who did I see but two men playing chess right there ! Right on top of the tables ! Well , I never saw that before  --  playing a game out  --  out in a . . . " She grew vague ; she sipped at her drink . As the vodka began to take hold her tone became more artificial and affected . " And I sat there and watched and watched , and the man who won the game was Jason , and my date was so mad ! And some of his fraternity brothers were there , and kidded him , and he got so mad , and Jason told him to go to hell . " She beamed at Jason . " It was so exciting . I ca n't remember it all now , " she said . " I have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Student Union , when he played chess with that old man in the shorts and the university sweat shirt that 's supposedto be crazy or something . . . . And so you are working on something long , like a book ? A book like a real one ? I mean , for libraries ? " she said politely . " Yes , baby , " Jason laughed , slapping Leo 's shoulder , " thishereis a scholar . He works in that liberry an ' do n't give his friends time to say hello ! " Leo laughed too ; the wildness of his own laughter alarmed him . He had been drinking Jason 's vodka while he waited forp229his wife . He had thought once or twice that she might be at home , waiting  --  and he saw her , suddenly , brushing her hair before the tiny bedroom mirror , he imagined their eyes joining in the mirror . But even in his imagination the mirror would be opaque  --  neither would really be able to see into it . " Mr. Scott , " the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing ? " " I am working on Beowulf , " Leo said . " Is that the man or the dog ? " Jason interrupted , roaring with laughter . Leo and the girl joined in , though Leo had heard the joke from Jason countless times .. The girl laughed too loudly . She leaned forward and kissed Leo on the cheek . " Oh , you 're so cute . He 's my English teacher , " she said to Jason . " Honey , you been tellin ' us that all night , " Jason said impatiently . " I never was this close to a teacher before , " the girl went on , " and I 'm getting a D from him ! A D from him ! " She seemed to think this was funny , so everyone laughed . " Somebody ought to take you home , " Leo said to the girl . " What time is it ? " " Hell , it 's early yet , " Jason protested . " This party ai n't begun . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo . There was a commotion in the middle of the room . Leo and Jason helped the girl to her feet . Edgar , the blind pianist , was doing a sort of dance , his face glazed and drunk , and everyone crowded about , cheering him on . He was about five feet four , an undernourished man of perhaps thirty who was said to have been born blind , and who reeled about now in the center of the room , waving his arms madly . " Imitation ! Imitation ! " he yelled shrilly . " What 's going on ? " Leo asked Stella . She was clapping andp230yelling encouragement , and when she glanced up at Leo he saw that her face was damp , her nose greasy through her make-up . " He 's doing an imitation , " she said , shrugging her shoulders . The little man dropped suddenly to his knees . His face was taut and frightened . He groped about on the bare floor . His mouth opened wider and wider . " I ca n't see ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror  --  such twisted , staring horror that Leo 's heart felt paralyzed . " Oh , God ! What happened ? I ca n't see ! What has God done to me ? " he wailed . Leo stared ; his body had gone cold . But the others were not fooled ; they appreciated the shrewd joke . " I ca n't see any more ! " the man cried , lowering his face to an inch or so above the floor , groping about with his child 's hands . Then he jerked up on his knees , cutely and alertly , like a puppy . " Pennies ! Pennies ! " He cupped his hands together , he jumped frantically on his knees . " Pennies for a poor blind man ! " He groped about before him again , around in little circles , scrambling forward so that one of the girls jumped aside with a sudden shriek . " What a fresh thing he is ! " she cried . Everyone laughed in delight . " I 'll do one ! " Domna cried . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strength , almost crushing him in her embrace . Her hair was loose and wild . " Look at me ! I 'll do one of a girl in love ! Dance , now ! C'm on ! In love with a guy ca n't decide how queer he is  --  halfway or three fourths , or every other day , or alternate week ends ! Look at this ! " She pulled up the skirt of her vivid red dress ; there was a wet spot on it . " He did it ! He did it ! " she cried , indicating with her head someone who stood behind her . Her eyes were like glass behind her vivid make-up . " Hey ! Let me do it ! Let me do the imitation ! " she screamed , as Marty tried to extricate the blind man from her . " You stink ! " the blind man shouted when he got his breath . He was white with rage . " Let go ! Goddam you ! You ruinedP231everything ! " Marty dragged Domna backward ; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ruined everything ! " the blind man yelled . Everyone laughed ; even Leo could not help himself . Miss Edwards turned to him . " Oh , what are they doing ? It is n't nice . It is n't nice , " she whimpered . " Make them stop it . What are they doing to themselves ? " The instructor Cowley forced his way through . He spread out his arms like an evangelist , crowing happily , " I 'll give a lecture ! I 'll give a lecture ! " He reeled ; someone caught him and shoved him forward . Hiccuping violently , he went on , " I 'll give a lecture of the academic perfession  --  prefessionprofession . . . You got to send out Christmas cards ! My God , thirty-five Christmas cards ! " He stared at the ceiling as if the enormity of this fact had just struck him . " What did I do wrong ? Did n't I smile at them all , and go over to fix Miss Stanley 's old record player  --  I bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got two articles published already , and a whole dissertation left  --  articles and bibliographies and notes in there , a gold mine ! What did I do wrong ? And it 's too late now , I 'm too old to go back  --  I could n't work like a regular man ! I want to write papers ! I want to write papers ! " But they had tired of him , and Marty reached out to drag him back . Gordie , taking advantage of the situation , giving vent to a long-suppressed urge , grabbed Cowley by the back of the neck and propelled him away , to everyone 's delight . " Go back to the East ! " he yelled . " We do n't have any time for a goddam tweedy , Eastern boring bastard ! I got my B.A. at a Wisconsin state college ! " When Gordie turned back he was flushed with success . His thin , nervous face was twitching . " Hey , Leo ! Leo ! " he shouted suddenly . " Why n't you do one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! Let 's see it ! Come on out here ! "  |p232Leo  stared in confusion . " C'm on , Leo ! Let 's see it ! " Gordie cried . " Leo Scott , Boy Scout genius , boy scholar , long-drawnoutpride of the department ! Long serious talks with me  --  Gordie , lad , use my note cards ! Gordie , lad , here 's a triangle to help you with Middle English dialects ! Gordie , lad , come over to dinner , see how happy I am ! Are you going to do an imitation ? " Gordie said . Leo opened his mouth to protest , but could say nothing . Sweat broke out on his face . Gordie unbuttoned his shirt at the collar . " Then I 'll do it for you , " he said . Marty took hold of his arm , but Gordie jerked away . " Hey ! Hey ! Everybody ! " he called in a whining falsetto . " Come one , come all ! Look at me ! Here I am ! What am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you forget that ! How happy I am ! " And he did a mincing dance step . " But where 's my wife ? " he wailed . An odd silence fell over the room . Leo stared but could not move . Gordie went on , grinning , " Let me at the loud-speaker , I want to announce it . Where the hell 's my wife ? First she would n't talk to me , and cried and cried all day long ! Drank tomato soup cold out of the can ! Then she locked herself in the bedroom ! Then she slept and slept with pills and such and would n't let me in  --  Elizabethan pun ! " he roared . " Did you hear that ? " " Oh , shut up ! " Stella shouted . Miss Edwards grabbed Leo 's arm . " Oh , what are they doing ? What are they doing ? " she cried . " He 's a nasty , filthy  --  a nasty man  --  a  --  " Sobbing , she ran teetering on her high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slap her in return when he was caught from behind . " What are you all doing ? It 's all ruined , all ruined . . . " she said . She turned and looked at them . She turned in a circle , teetering drunkenly ; her hand was raised . Then she happened to look at Leo . " But you , " she said , coming to him , " you 're nice . You 're nice . You are . I think youp233are . Do n't bother about him . I hit him . Do n't bother about him . " Gordie fell sideways with a crash , and a few people closed in to help him . Leo could not see . His eyes were burning , his head ringing with alarm , shock , but beneath it all , rising feverishly to the surface , was something close to hilarity . He seized the girl and brushed her cheek with his teeth . He felt her firm back before Jason 's slithering arms appeared . " Honey baby , what you doin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you too , " the girl cried . " I love you too ! I did n't forget you ! " She was laughing again ; her eyes were furious with excitement . " I love you all ! " She pushed them away with her little hands and ran past them to the door . " Hey , honey babe ! " Jason cried . " Honey ! " They heard her heels clattering in the hall . Jason followed . Leo remembered pushing Claude Haunsman violently aside . He followed Jason out into the cold hallway . " Honey , your coat ! Your pretty white fur coat ! " Jason shouted . The girl laughed , running down the stairs , . Jason followed ; the stairs creaked dangerously beneath him . Leo , panting hoarsely , his mind buzzing , following thunderously half a flight behind . The Negro caught her on the landing . They reeled about , clutching each other , the girl 's white dress ghostly in the dim stairway . " No , no ! " Miss Edwards cried . Then she broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back to him . " Oh , the both of you ! The both of you ! " she gasped . Leo seized one of her waving arms . The feel of her soft skin alarmed him . She wrenched her mouth away from Jason 's , her eyes filmy , and grabbed hold of Leo around the neck . The three of them struggled together . " Oh , you ca n't ! " She kicked Leo in the ankle , broke away again , and started runningp234down the stairs . " You ca n't follow ! You ca n't ! " Jason clamored after her . Leo glanced up , saw most of the party looking down from the landing above . Then he followed . At the vestibule of the old building they grappled a while before the girl managed to open the door . " It 's cold ! Where is my coat ? " she screamed . " Jason , you get my coat . You get my  --  " Leo heard something rip . He could not see what had happened . He had one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wrist in her small , hot hands . Jason was puffing her his way . Now and then he and Leo would glance at one another , but almost incidentally  --  accidentally  --  as if they were not really conscious of each other , did not really care . The girl grabbed Jason 's big head suddenly and pulled it down to her breasts , forcing him on his knees . Then she cried , " Go away ! Go away ! " and jerked from them , clattering in her high heels out toward the street . The wind off Lake Mendota was bitterly cold . The girl ran down the sidewalk , shouting back at them , cajoling them , teasingthem , screaming defiantly , " I 'm going back to the dormitory ! Going back ! It 's past curfew , I 'll be expelled  --  You ca n't stop me ! " Leo and Jason ran panting after her , . The street was empty ; a side street , made up of old buildings and deserted stores , it had few lights , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl again she whirled on them , beating at their faces with surprisingly hard fists . Leo and Jason , panting , enraged , excited beyond endurance , hardly noticed each other in their feverish mauling of the girl , who seemed to arch herself upon them both at once , turning her face up , closing her smeared eyes in a parody of ecstasy . Leo kissed her cheek , her throat , crying , " I love you ! I love you ! " His eyes burned with tears . His mind had emptied and was buzzing hollowly  --  the buzzing was not calmed but rather intensified by the frequent encounter of his hands , his arms ,  |p235with  those of Jason 's . They struggled together near the curb , stumbled into the street . The girl squealed as if she were being tickled to death . " Oh , I love you ! I love you ! " Leo shouted , suffocating with the violence of his passion , falling to his knees in the cold street and embracing their legs , their bodies , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something strange happened to him , the old man , Revere , had felt it descend down upon him like an opaque white mist , something which was still part of his dream and would not let him wake . He had been dreaming of the past again that night , and his dream had been fragmented and confused , like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle spilled across his mind . He had dreamed first of the winter his wife had died  --  not of her death , really , but of the house as she lay dying , with her two sisters at her bedside , whispering , and whispering atp237mealtimes , strangers to him  --  and he had dreamed of his childhood , oddly , so long ago , and of the schoolteacher in the old schoolhouse down the road . These memories had flattened as if they were no more than photographs , and he saw them from a distance , until all the land he owned , and the road , and the jungle-like expanse of the countryside lay before him . It was not the daylight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be his picture of what the land had been like before anyone had come to it . He sometimes thought about things like that  --  his grandfather had been one of the first settlers here  --  and Revere , though he could hardly remember the old man , felt a strange kinship with him . But then he saw in his dream that there were already people there : men working in fields , children dawdling to school , and that all of them were surrounded by the great pressure of the forest and of weeds , acres of weeds , pressing in on them . He remembered thinking clearly : I spent sixty-eight years fighting those weeds  --  sixtyeightyears , . Then the discomforting scene changed to a fine white mist , and he felt himself rising through it as if through water ; rising , soaring to air , to life , having cheated death at least one more day . He knew before he woke that something strange had happened . Maybe in the house , maybe outside . And , later , as he groped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise for another half hour  --  he heard the hound whining , and his fingers froze to the cold buttons of his shirt . It was Nell . He could hear her in the shed , whining , scratching against the screen door . When he opened the door the dog crawled across the threshold to him , shivering . " Hey , what 's wrong with the hound ? Too cold for you ? " he laughed , but then his laughter stopped . He stooped and saw what was wrong : The dog 's ears had been slit , neatly and viciously , and were now crusted with dried blood . Revere held the dog trembling against him , trembling himself , and looked off to the screenp238door and beyond to the grass blurred with dew , and to his farm buildings and the outer blur of his land , just waking to light . That had been the day before . Now Revere stood in the shed by his house and stared in bewilderment at his barn . Somehow the sight of the white smoke rising slowly behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its anxious eyes , came to him at the same time : He saw them together , and he both realized something and doubted everything . At first he had thought the barn was on fire , but running out as far as the pump he could see that only the grass in the field behind the barn was burning . The wind came from the northwest , from the mountains far to the north , and gently fanned the flames . Sometimes the narrow fire would die down , and white smoke would rise in a puff ; but in the next instant the flames would reappear , slyly , slanting up over the top of the grass , bent flat by the wind . Revere grabbed both wooden buckets and filled them at the pump ; then he set them down and ran back to the shed , muttering to himself , and got a broom that was propped up in a corner with a fine network of cobwebs about it . Running back again , he thought : I ought to of fired that field myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't all that wind . Behind the barn the fire inched away from him . The field seemed to be dissolving in white smoke ; and , sometimes hiddenfrom him , sometimes piercing to his eyes , toothlike flames flared upward . Far to the right the hay barn tilted , looking as if it were leaning away in fear , . Revere stared at it as he stumbledacross the field . " It ai n't gettin ' to you , " he muttered . He began beating wildly at the flames with the broom , now and then looking around at the hay barn . It was still safe . He worked for some time . " Least I 'll get this field cleaned , " he thought , but he could not fool himself with such thoughts for long ; as he stood with his heels in the dirt , slamming at thep239flames , his breath searing his throat , he knew that he could not fool himself . Nothing he might think up later , nothing he could contrive into words , would make up for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shimmering heat , the broom was smoldering , and there was a black burnt spot on his trousersthat he thought might be widening ; but it was all right . The fire was nearly out now , and he was all right  --  there was only a patch of it left , small flames licking at the dry tufts of grass near the ground . He poured water on it . The milky smoke curled up . He was turning , the creaking bucket in his hand , when something happened : A great wave of heat struck him , conspiring with the weariness inside his head ; something slammed against his back and he lay still . He woke at about noon . He was lying on his back where he had fallen . He got stiffly to his feet , blinking in confusion and shame , and when he looked at the field he was astonished at how small the fire had been . It had come nowhere near the hay barn or even the fence on the other side . He stared at it almost as if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hot and opaque and gently mocking . He could not remember falling ; he could not think how it had happened . But when he felt the familiar weariness in his back and legs he understood ; he understood why he had fallen there and why he had fallen the other time  --  on the road coming from the store when some children had been running after him and throwing pieces of dried mud , shouting , " Old Revere ! Old man Revere ! " He looked around at his land . The summer sky looked hardenedby heat , and beneath it the land lay still , save for where the wind prodded it  --  fluttering of leaves and slow , graceful eclipsing of light by shadow . When he turned back , the hound , Nell , rose from where she had been lying and ran to him . " Yes , it 's all right , " he said , stroking the dog 's head . He lookedp240around as if he thought someone might be watching . " Do n't you worry about me . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . Now he sat on the bench by the shed door and rested in the sunlight , looking at the barn and thinking about the smoke and the dog 's ears . Around the corner blackbirds were rioting in the cherry tree , but he did not have the strength to get up to chase them away . Not that it mattered , for he had given up picking the cherries long ago , and besides they were small and often wormy . Thinking of cherries ought to have made him hungry , and he felt a vague dutiful notion to go in and eat ; but he did not move . Overhead the sun moved past the peak of the house , and the shadow in which he sat extended to his feet . The dog lay before him , sleeping , and sometimes stretched out her legs as if she were pushing something away . Revere watched the hound and thought about what had happened . He knew that something had happened . And there had to be a reason for it  --  a reason he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knowledge , the kind of thinking found in books , though Heaven knew he had never been good at it himself . He had never read a word until he was thirty , and only then when the schoolteacher had taken such pains with him , acting serious all the time , refusing to give in and laugh at a grown man doing a child 's lessons . Revere felt a sudden flash of warmth for the man ; he had liked him fine . But after so long , after such work , he had forgotten everything ; he found one day , when he tried to read again , that it had slipped away from him . He was as ashamed of that now , thirty-eight years later , as he had been on that day . So much time wasted . He used to go over to the schoolhouse after the children left , every afternoon , and the schoolteacher  --  a young man afraid of the big boys  --  would talk to him and show him books , books hep241would like Revere to read later on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass case at the front of the room . Chalk dust would hang in the silent air . When Revere spoke it would be slowly and politely , not the way he bawled orders at home . He could never understand why the young man did not laugh at him . He wanted to learn ; he felt the young man 's strange desire to teach him ; but when it was time to speak or read  --  why , Revere would stare at the print and at his big thumbs on either page , and everything would get mixed up . Revere , filled with shame , could not look up at the teacher . One winter there was trouble : A boy had struck the teacher ; he had fallen . Revere never found out how seriously he was hurt , or what happened to him after he left . The schoolhouse was boarded up for a while , then opened again a few years later , for the winter months . But now it was closed again and had been closed for about three years . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go somewhere else , miles away . On his walks Revere often crossed the fields to the school , and there he would sit on the stone steps and think . His feet would sprawl idly before him . The old building was in disrepair , its windows boarded up crazily , and looking at it made Revere feel bad . He would sit and think of the past and of the school on those dark winter afternoons , of the young man 's careful , friendly voice . . . . The schoolhouse was the key to one of his secrets . It was there that his saddest failure had occurred ; but that failure was not really something he wanted to forget . As if he felt the necessity to remember , he would return again and again to the ruined school and , sitting on the steps , stare dreamilyout at the wild grass and the dirt road and the field beyond . Sometimes a farmer would be in the field working a team , and he would come to the fence and lean over , settling himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the man , but atp242that distance he could not be sure  --  his eyes were not so good any more  --  and he had to smile and nod as if he understood everything well . " You , Revere , " the man would say . His face was broad and tanned , and snatches of yellow hair showed beneath his straw hat . " Ai n't you got nothin ' to do at home ? Ai n't there somethin ' there you should see to ? " Revere supposed this was a joke , so he would laugh an old man 's cackle and answer , " It goes on by itself . " " Is that so ? " the man would say , spitting toward the ditch . " You sure of that now ? " " Always was like that , " Revere would say . He felt both cheerful and discomforted , but he would laugh just the same , as if the man 's words struck him as funny . " You watch out life do n't catch up with you , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " Revere would answer . After a while the man 's eyes would move away and he would gradually seem to forget Revere , as if the old man did not matter . His hands would be busy pulling absently and viciously at stalks of grass growing by the fence posts , pulling them out and shredding them in his strong fingers , and letting the wind blow the pieces away . When Revere went home the sight of the farm always discouragedhim ; he could not believe it had fallen into such disrepair . The barns looked tilted  --  they did for a fact  --  and the yard was wild with grass gone to seed , and chickens running loose that did not know him , and pieces of wire and stones and old wheels lying around : chicken fencing , boards , sheets of asbestos , things for which there were no longer any names , all lying around , telling lazily of failure . He would go around them to the house . This at least looked better , though Heavenp243knew it would never be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there were the children  --  the two boys and Nancy , his daughter . It seemed to have changed as if by magic  --  the shed and the house and the whole look of the land  --  as soon as he was finally left alone . Now he stirred on the bench . The dog woke at once . One of her ears had fallen back , showing the pink , scarred inside . As Revere looked at the dog he realized slowly , and with the sense of approaching a revelation of sorts , that he was very tired , deathly tired . Only a few years ago he and the boys used to fire the fields , the one behind the barn and the long one by the creek , and then he had been able to work all morning and afternoon and feel nothing except hunger ; maybe a little weariness , but mostly hunger . How the boys worked with him , shouting and running with brooms ! They had not even worn shirts . . . . But that must have been more than only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank and Will , with the blackened brooms over their shoulders , big strong boys , taller than he already , with their dirty faces slit by grins , cuffing each other when he was n't looking , arguing even at the suppertable with their faces washed and their big feet sticking out from under the table . . . . Was it possible that he was their father , that he had made possible their lives , their strength , their fierce awkward affection for him ? Later Frank had got into trouble with that knife he had been so proud of buying . The boy he had fought with had died ; people said he just lay down and bled as if there was no end to it , and Frank had run , run off on foot , and Revere had never heard from him again . Sometimeshis wife would forget that and talk about Frank as if he were still home , and when she lay in her final sickness she often spoke of him , whining that he had n't come to kiss her good-by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had neverp244kissed her when he was home ; they never did such things ) . Revere had waited for a few years before he began to think of Frank as dead . When Will left home he wrote letters back , he wrote five or six of them ; and Revere still had them somewhere around the house . In his last letter he said he was traveling somewhere west , to find work with a lot of other men ; but they had heard no more from him . Revere remembered Will as the slighter of the two boys , the dark one , the one he had never really gotten to know , and then it was too late . The history of the boy 's life with them seemed a mystery , as if a stranger had lived with them , and Revere too stupid to find out much about him . . . . When Frank had run off , it was Will who told him . They had stood outside , right by the shed , and Will 's face was wet and his dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you he got in some trouble , " Will had said . " He  --  he got in some trouble back there " The boy 's eyes got big and wet , and Revere had been astonished and ready to tell him that boys never cried  --  until he heard the news . Behind Will one of the big lilac trees was moving a little in the wind , all its flowers shriveled and brown , and around it some chickens were pickingin their brisk , alert , ridiculous way , jerking their heads up now and then as if someone had called to them . Then in Revere 's daydream the time changed , and it was later : a wintertime , inside the house . Revere tried to remember which time this was , and why his daughter Nancy was standing by the big bedroom door , and why she looked so stupidly at him . Then he remembered that his wife was sick and that her sisters were in the room , and they must have said something to Nancy ; she had run out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pay any attention to them , " he had told her , " they 're just old  --  " The Nancy of that day had been married just the summer before and lived with her husband and his folks ; shep245seemed suddenly a stranger ; she looked at him as though he were a stranger . " Oh , and you too ! I 'm sick of you all ! " she had cried . Then she stopped and looked funny and ran to him and took both his hands . " Oh , Pa , " she said . Revere 's face ached as if it wanted to smile or something , but when he opened his mouth to talk he had nothing to say . He remembered having lifted Nancy high into the air when she was a baby , and swinging her around while the boys shouted and stamped in excitement and his wife pleaded with him to stop ; but the memory was only his , not Nancy 's ; they did not share it ; she cared nothing for it . As she held his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile but somehow never did .. . . Then the time changed again , and it was later still  --  another incident . This time Nancy was talking to him as if it were she and not he who was older . Nancy wanted him to come to live with them in Pools Brook  --  that was it  --  but he could n't keep his mind still long enough to think about it ; he could n't quite understand it . " I never expected to be eaten up by things , one after the other , " he had said to them . Nancy 's husband was both embarrassed and impatient ; he must have hated to talk to an old man like this , to argue with him about something so trivial . " I would n't know how to start over again in another house , " he had said . His words had made sense to him , but Nancy had gone on with something different as if she had not even been listening . After a while she had left , angry , and her husband with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out of his kitchen window . The young man had light hair and small nervous eyes ; he too was a stranger , and he and Nancy , walking fast alongside each other but not touching , seemed to be strangers to each other as well . Revere felt a pang of guilt , as if he had betrayed Nancy , as he had betrayed his sons , by bringing them all into a world of strangers . Therep246was something perplexing about it , but it was too difficult for him to think of and made him feel bad , and already his mind was confused with other things . Like hungry flies , his thoughts buzzed around inside his head . Now it was an old unfinished argument with the schoolteacher he was thinking of , and now his wife ; now , a handsaw someone had borrowed and never returned ; now , his wife 's sisters jealously guarding her death amid a smell of moth balls , with the curtains moving in that spring 's late , sickly light . . . Then Revere woke with a start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bench , but he straightened and stared about the cluttered yard as if ready to jump up and challengeanyone who was there . The yard was empty . Behind the barn the field was blurred . He rubbed his eyes , but he could see no better ; green grass and burnt grass melted into one another . He looked at things closer to him , safer to look at . Nell had gone , and the grass was still flattened where she had been lying . " Well , " he said , yawning , " I s'pose I am gettin ' old , to need sleep like that after such a little fire . . . . Only a little fire . . " He mumbled to himself without listening . He was goingto stand , and his legs were tensed for the effort ; but for some reason he did not stand . He remained on the bench , his head bowed , his eyes on the dust at his feet . There was something he must think of , something he must understand ; but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up and went insidethe house . There he listened for the dog , for the sound of her toenails on the rough planking of the shed . After a while , as he put together something to eat , moving wearily from place to place , grunting aloud , he forgot what he had been listening for . When Revere had finished the meal , he stayed seated at the old table , his arms out before him , staring at the window with itsp247blind , dull orange glow . Then he happened to look around and saw someone standing at the door . He only happened to look around ; he had not heard any sound . A young boy stood peeringthrough the loose screen of the door . For a moment Revere and the boy stared at each other . Then the boy said , " Mister , could you come out here a minute ? " Revere was angry that his heart was pounding so . He got up and went to the door . " What do you want ? " he said . He and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both knew there was someone else out there , . The boy was smiling in a broad , peculiar way . " Somebody to see me ? Your pa , maybe ? " Revereasked . But he did not know who the boy was . There were so many young people around , boys growing up , nearly men , he could no longer keep track of them all . " Your pa out there ? " Jae said . " Ai n't my pa , " said the boy . He came up to about Revere 's chin  --  a heavy , strong boy , about twelve , with a tanned face and dirty blond hair . He went ahead of Revere . Outside stood two other boys . Revere shaded his eyes . " AnythingI can do for you ? " he said . He supposed he knew their fathers or grandfathers , but no names came to mind . The tallestof the three stood with a grimy bare foot on Revere 's bench . He had almost white hair and pale eyebrows and eyelashes ; he was smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land ? " Revere said , though he saw before the words were out that they carried no poles . " You can take that path there  --  " " Ai n't fish we 're intrested in today , " the tall boy said . " We wondered if we could . . . " He looked at Revere evenly , while the other two smiled identically and gazed up past Revere 's head to the roof of the house . " We wondered if we could use some of your water there . " " You never needed to ask , " said Revere . He waved toward the pump . But the boys did not move , andp248the tallest one leaned over the bench and spat into the dust as if he was tired of waiting for something . The heavy one  --  the one who had come to Revere 's door , the one with a careful blank face and a round stomach , prominent under his overalls  --  simply watched . And the third boy , the youngest , stood with his two upper front teeth catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's right there . You go ahead , " said Revere . Running to the pump , the two bigger boys poked at the other , not looking back at Revere . He watched as the fat boy took hold of the pump handle as if testing it and began pumping . Water splashed down onto the wooden planks . Revere waited , and he saw with a strange , weakening sense of dismay  --  a sense of something within him dissolving , collapsing  --  that they had no bottles or buckets , that they simply stood around the glistening platform while the fat boy pumped , the old pump handle creaking , the water splashing down onto the planks . The fat boy was jerking the pump handle up as high as it would go , even jumping a little with it , looking so funny that the other two laughed  --  the little boy especially , laughing with his eyes pinched blind , his hands slapping at his thighs like a grown man 's . After about five minutes they lost interest . They whispered together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : an old man standing before his rottinghouse , his thin white hair wild about his head , his arms half raised in an absurd gesture of alarm . The boys jumped off the pump platform and started back . The fat one came first . He was smiling now , and as he neared Revere the old man could see drops of water on his face , as though the boy had been out in the rain . " My brothers an ' me want to thank you kindly , " he said . The other boys laughed . The fat boy did not glance at them but wiped his forehead importantly . The back of his hand , suddenly uplifted , was smeared with dirt and some/thing red , maybe paint . Revere did not know what to say . " We were all hot before , " the fat boy said chattily . " We been walkin ' , " the little boy said . " Yes , " said the fat boy . " That will fix us up fine . " Revere waited . There seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't understand , " he said . " Well , you got them-there white whiskers , " the fat boy said . The others laughed , and the fat boy laughed too , suddenly , as if he had n't meant to but could n't help it . He looked past Revere , up to the roof of the house or to the sky . " Well . I guess we 'll be goin ' now . " " We got to eat supper , " the little boy said . " We ca n't stay , " the fat boy said . " I guess we 'll be back , though . We 'll be back tomorrow . " They turned and went back along the path . Revere watched them . He watched them with a dull pain beginning in his chest , maybe in his heart . By the pump the boys looked around . " You got yourself some flies there , " the fat boy called in a high , singsong voice . " What ? " said Revere . " What ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their faces blurred across the distance . " Lots of flies around the corner there . That corner there . " They turned and ran . Revere stood with his heart pounding madly as before . Then he went to the corner of the shed . The ground was barren and stony there and had eroded sharply away from the house . A few feet away stood the lilac tree that had always been stunted , stunted in the shade of the house . . . . Revere stopped suddenly .. He was about to call to the dog , when he noticed the deep gash in her stomach , and the blood , and the glinting circle of flies buzzing around her . He ran , sliding on the rocky ground , to her side . As he bent over , flies grazed his face . He touched the dog'sp250head ; her eyes were open and wet and seemed to be looking at him . He got up , scrambling , knocking pebbles downhill , and went back to the corner of the house . His eyes had turned so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him like this when he needed them so desperately . He stumbled on down the path . He thought of what he would say to the boys when he found them , how he would shout , how sternly , with what furious strength he would confront them , how they would cringe  --  they were only boys ! But when he began shouting hoarsely , " You there ! You boys ! Come back here . . . " he felt he did not know what else to say . He was hurrying , stumbling . He could not always see the ground ; it seemed to jerk beneath him . He stopped by a rusty overturned barrel to catch his breath . How weak his eyes had become ! Revere knew what his land and barns looked like , so he could fill in details that were now blurred and gone ; but he could not really see them . Or the grass either . It was made of millions of little stalks , moving in the wind , but to Revere it looked like a solid green river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that ? " he cried . He shook his fist . " Why did you ? Why did you come on my land to do that ? " A skinny white chicken darted away , clucking in terror . " You tell me why you did it ! " Revere shouted . " I never done nothin ' to any man , not a one of them . I never got born to fight . . . He stared in anger at his own trembling hands . The sunlight was quiet about him but  --  try though he did  --  he could not see the boys anywhere , not hiding in the grass or looking at him around the corner of his barn . He thought of the children running after him on the road that day , and how he had joked with them at first and then had seen that they were not laughing with him , but only staring at him , their little hands raised and about to throw something at him . " You old Revere ! " they hadp251cried , but it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who he was  --  there was no reason for their behavior . Now he stared at the fine golden glow that had begun to descendupon the countryside , on the tops of the waving blades of grass , imparting a strange soft light to his own familiar land , as if an answer to his questions might somehow come from out of nowhere . To the wavering abstract pictures of the boys that remained in his memory , he shouted , " You come back ! Come back here ! All my life I done battle against it : that life do n't mean nothin ' ! That it do n't make sense ! Sixty-eight years of a battle , so you come back ! You listen to me ! You ai n't goin ' to change my mind now , an ' me grown so old an ' come so far . . . . " The wind eased upon him from the northwest again . It touched his tearful squinting eyes and his raised fist . " All of sixty-eight years , " he said , this time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sixty-eight years I fought it . . . an ' I never give in , not once . Not with Frank even . . . . I never give in . " He believed there was something he should do , somethinga man ought to do , even an old man ; but it would never get to the beginning of things . It would never get through . At the rim of his consciousness the faces of the boys floated , but they no longer possessed any identity , any individuality . By an effort of the will that exhausted him , that strained his mind and even his heart , he saw them enveloped by a greater darkness beyond them , the darkness of this wild land itself ; he saw them caught within the accidental pattern of a fate in which he himselfwould be caught . " But they ai n't no judgment upon the world , " he said scornfully . " They ai n't anything but boys , no more . No more than that .

He stood onp252the path and stared at his blackened shoes while his hand groped along the side of the rusted barrel , coming away flecked with soft rust . He sat down heavily . The barrel rolled a little forward and stopped , then rolled back to its groove in the earth ; and Revere sat with his feet out before him , his legs stiff and tensed and weak all at once . " This here ai n't no more than a accident , " he mumbled , and then to his slow delight everything seemed clear . He felt he was arguing with the young man who had taught school down the road so long ago . It was in such a way they had argued , argued about life , about strange things  --  no one else had ever talked to Revere like that , not even his wife , not even his father  --  and Revere would give his side and , knowing all along he was right , would leave out parts so that the teacher could fill them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm and dusty around them , emptied of the children , and the windows already showingdark at five-thirty , and the schoolteacher with his worried eyes , his abstract gaze , who thought so long before he spoke  --  what was it they had talked about ? One time , one winter afternoon , they had talked about stories , in particular about a story Revere had just finished reading ( it had taken him about a week to do so , trying to figure out the words before the teacher told him what they were , reading painfully aloud ) . The story was about magic and things happening in a past time , in another world ; it was about a young girl , and death and disorder that befell her , that came to her in the form of a dark man . " It do n't make no sense , " Revere had said , pretending more scorn than he felt and lookingslyly up at the teacher , " ' cause things do n't happen that way in the world . " The teacher had had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that time , though , and the smell of chalk and dust and the coal **29;4343;TOOLONG against the background of white , so bold that not even the falling snow obscured them : SHADOWS ON THE SUNa new play byRalph JoplinDirected by Paul Lancer . Produced by London Petit . Designed by Ma ... . Iris ' eyes swept back to the first three lines . She grinned . " Yes , I see it . " Now the cab came to a stop beneath the marquee . " It 's like showtime , " Iris said breathlessly , feeling excited by the lights , the people , the noise . She thought , as they hustled through the door , into the plush warmth of the theatre , of her first years of success  --  of those years with Time . It was funny . Funny that how much you learned depended in great measure on how much you suffered . And funny too that just when you realized that you were paying , you understood how much more you owed . She had not realized this until she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians shunting back and forth across the continent . In that first year of her success she became accustomed to the feel of a re-emerging Europe . Not even the shame of an occupied France , Time said , lingered longer than necessary to create the illusion of grief . Germany was like the bully who had been caught again in the act of beating a hapless victim . And those free nations that lay outside the arc which had closed from the hinge in the East picked themselves up and began again . The countries inside the arc , ringed in the twilight of the war by ZhukovP71and Konev were never considered much anyway . Wherever they went there were whispers about the Jews , the Jews , like an orgy one stumbled on and participated in , perhaps , or wished to but did n't . Graves registration teams still functioned . One came upon them in little hotels in the provinces east of Paris , Caen and Le Havre ; they were found in Rennes , Avranches , Alsace and in Germany , where the camps with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one period Iris ' troupe seemed to be forever in sight of military cemeteries with their geometrically neat rows of white crosses interspersed with occasional Stars of David . The pianist complained that every fourth man in Reims was one-armed . But Time was above all a businessman . He demanded " front money " ( an advance ) and was uneasy over " back money " ( arrears ) . He haggled unashamedly over money and halls ( " Got to have something that 'll give back the sound . " ) He was band boy , manager , leader , father and brother , and he was indefatigable . He would schedule a trip to the end of the farthest province if it paid well , and never had them play above his audiences or , if he did , he managed not to be condescending . Some of the trips were long and terminated in cold hotels run by wizened , unkind concierges ; sometimes at the end of long second-class-coach trips there were hissing audiences who did n't understand . Then Time gave the group a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently there was that beautiful teamwork , when theme and melodic line , furiously nurtured by Time , passed from him to the horn and then back again , clicking dynamically . Iris knew that behind her the rhythm seemed every turn , every revolution of the world ; seemed a reaching beyond forp72the greatest , unscored beat , the inexplicable vibration of being and doing . And when those moments , held as long as humanly possible , were over and they had sensed exactly what they had done , the dull , disappointing , slightly bewildered feeling of having been rudely jettisoned in flight came to Iris ; the feeling was to come many times . Even more than as a child she now felt herself part of a wild , happy family . The musicians surveyed her dates and commented on them ; she in turn destroyed their illusions about women . She slept with her room doors unlocked ; they came to her to talk of their women , their sisters or mothers back home . Sometimes they just talked . Iris found it very strange and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow that they wanted to sleep with her . For a period of several months she drank too much , then suddenly not at all . She had clothes , perfume and shoe binges  --  above all she loved shoes . She became exhilarated with Europe as she never could have been with Harry . She came to know that she was a desirable woman ; she knew it from a hundred phrases and by the way she was looked at . She remembered when she sang , arching her body , curving her arms in the spots , that the men who came , came for her and not her voice . Iris became European ; she belonged to the Continent . They came , the jazzmen , rich with talent and ideas and an awareness of America which could not be separated from their disgust of it ; the only America they referred to was New York . The greatest of them was Charlie Parker , who arrived that first year and played the Salon du Jazz , the Salle Pleyel , the St. Germaine clubs , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Jax , the bass , new to Time 's group , were deeply scarred psychologically . Toots Jones , an old-time trumpeter who could no longer make it in America was Jax 's victim that year . Toots was considered the swingingest by the Paris squares , but had said " Yessir " and " Nosir " to a white American record company executive kicking it up on the town . Jax and Iris , on the club route , saw it , heard it : Jax called Toots an Uncle Tom , and Toots said he could n't be like the young cats who 'd been raised to kick asses  --  he could n't change the way he was raised up so he could survive . Jax , short , bull-like , with fierce yellow eyes and the bassist 's strong hands , cried , " It 's never too late ! " They began fighting , gasping and punching in the street , the Arc de Triomphe in the distance . Toots died a year later and Jax cried when he heard about it in Stockholm ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She remembered that year because of Jax and Toots ; Charlie Parker , high on champagne , had made a pass at her in the Hotel St. George V. There was a sudden new phase which began with the letter from Robbie . It was one of those half-cool , half-patriotic letters , the kind of letter Iris rememberedRalph 's having written once , filled with quiet reminiscencesand youthful philosophizings . Then nothing else until the letter from Sissie arrived saying that Robbie was in Korea , caught in the two-year Army . Iris wondered : would the war affect Robbie as it had Ralph ? But that war was too small , too far away and too soon after the big one . Few people noticed it or cared . Even Sissie , given to War Mother 's bouquets and Service Stars in the window , made it sound like a two-week sojourn in a Boy Scout camp . Iris remembered the parties Robbie had gone to ; they hadp74been like the parties her own group had held . He had grown up so quickly . One summer day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The war 's a year old and no one 's much concerned with it , " she said to Time , sitting opposite her . " Why should they be ? " Time asked . " Just wondered to myself . " " Brother still there ? " " As far as I know . " " Tough , " he said without hardness . " He 'll be all right , if he 's like you . " " Thanks . " " Wars , " Time said , " are for fools and the desperate . " Iris was silent . " I went into the line a few miles north of here , " Time continued . " I volunteered . Me and thirty-five other fools . No , we were n't fools . Yes , we were fools , " he said again . " We were all colored . We went from there all the way into Frankfort with crackers behind us and Germans in front of us . A whole platoon . Well , that 's not much in a big war . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only two of us left ; two out of thirty-five men , my sergeant and me . His name was Moody and he cracked up . " He brought his eyes down to hers and they smiled at her . He called for jenever . " Oh , you liked it , " Iris said , teasingly . " Sure . " When his drink came he said , " We had to steal guns to fight with when arms gave out . We had to  --  " He was chuckling . He turned toward her . " You know what we did ? They put us on the point , our lousy little platoon ; we had to hit every objective first , take it out or bring it down to where the cracker boys behind us could handle it . My God.  |p75We  lost half the platoon on our first two assaults . Then , " he said slyly , " we got slick . We 'd run up to the Germans , fire away like hell , making all the goddamn racket in the world , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around "  --  he moved his arm in a big , slow semicircle  --  " and on past . Those crackers would come charging up , thinking we 'd taken the Germans out , and  --  Lord ! " Time smiled . He straightened up . " The lieutenant would ask Moody what had happened and Moody , face all straight , would say , We took ' em out , they must 've brought up more troops ! ' " " Is that why you did n't go home ? " " Why go home when you have this ? " he nodded toward the street . Three girls were walking in their direction . They whispered to one another when they saw Time and Iris , and smiled . Time smiled back ; Iris studied the girls as they drew abreast and her eyes followed them as they passed . " Stop kidding , " Iris said . " I only have my mother at home , " he said . " Home is the furthest thing from my mind . That reminds me : I wish you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . You shake everybody up . Slim 's talking about going home . " " Slim 's always talking about going home . " " Yeah , but he 's talking more about it lately . " Iris stood . " Thanks for the tour . " " My pleasure . " " Did n't think those Indonesian chicks would let you out of sight long enough for you to get some culture . " " Ha , ha . " " Ha , ha , hell . " She glanced meaningfully at him . He shot her a glance , dropped his eyes to her body . " S'long , baby . "  | " Like that ? " " Now , " he said , " you stop kidding . " She turned , smiling , and picked her way over the cobblestones . He would be taking a new look , she thought , at her backside . Nine months later she received the letter . She stared at the postmark ; it was n't from California , it was from home , but it was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered . She opened it and scanned the bold scrawl . Dear Iris , Surprised ? This is a sad day . I 'm here to bury Robbie next to Juanita and Mary Ellen . Oh , I knew about it three months ago , I just did n't want to upset you . I asked for him and they sent him to Los Angeles and then across country . I rode with him all the way and now he 's with them , where I think maybe we all should go . Ralph wanted to come , but I told him no . Would n't even let Oliver come . I called your father and we went together . Seems like that cemetery 's got half of us already , but I know the Lord is working His will . Suppose now that Robbie 's gone I can tell you . Told Ralph already . Maybe you knew it though , that Robbie was my favorite . Do n't be mad now . All mothers got a favorite . And I was rooting so hard for him after you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like nothing was going right , but I knew it was God 's will . A hard one , but His all the same . You know Robbie wanted to be a doctor and how bright he was in school . Do n't seem fair . Not for me or the family , for the Government to take all the colored boys and send them out to be killed and not let them have any rights . God will have His vengeance . Thinking about moving back East . Do n't know . All the folks are still the same Willa Mae and Louise and Edward . Ai n't changed a bit . Shiftless . I suppose I should be grateful that Ralph was n't killedp77too . And I am , Lord knows I am , but Robbie was my heart . You and Ralph was scrambling to get out of the way of Juanita and Mary Ellen . Robbie was the last . Lord , I wanted this family to be a great strong tree , like some of those oaks on your gram pa 's place . But something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the roots . And I just left another branch in the ground . God willing , see you before much longer ? Going back to Cal tonight . Wanted you to know , and do n't grieve , child . Get right with God then you can take anything . Mother . Iris could only think of Robbie in the postures of dancing to " After Hours , " tall , thin , crouched over whispering in some girl 's ear . Or him looking at her , his eyes brighter and more hopeful than they had a right to be . Bold , beholding limitless faith in himself . Sissie had given him that , that seemingcareless ability to stride through the world . She thought of him but could not cry . How unfair , she continued thinking , that once here you expected the process of living to carry you with a certain degree of casualness to an ultimate end . God 's will . She wanted to curse , but could not . Poor Mother , she thought . Poor tree being eaten leaf by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the very root . Robbie gone . One less face to smile up at her when she returned home , and perhaps by the time she got there , there would be another missing and another , but that was , as Sissie said , Iris thought with a bitter smile , God 's will ... . The months continued to pass and too quickly became years . Time and Iris , though drawn to each other , achieved no strong relationship , as though each knew it was not yet the proper time for that . The influx of American NegroesP78had become a steady trickle . The club circuit grew from a dozen cities to twice as many . Jax was the first to return home and was replaced by Leonard , a thin , reserved young man with a leaning toward the classics ; he was in fact a better cellist than a bassist . Iris liked the classical touch . Slim , always on the point of going home , finally booked passage and told Time at the end of a rehearsal . " Man , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nothing . " " What 're you going back for ? " " I just want to go home , man . Why we have to argue about that ? " Slim and Time were good friends . " You want to go home to get kicked in the ass ? They beg you to come back ? They tell you , Slim we need you ' ? " " Time , let 's not argue . I 'm going . " " You 're a goddamn fool ! " Time said sharply . " Easy , Time , " Slim warned . He was slow to anger . Time did n't leave off goading him . " Cats getting theirblack asses out of there as fast as they can get coins and hereyou 're trying to get back in . " " Oh , man , go ' head , " Slim said , turning away . " Damn , Slim . " The anger had suddenly left Time 's voice . " That ai n't no place for us . We 're musicians  --  artists . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JJ . They 're doing all right . " Time scoffed . " You sure ai n't Bird and you ai n't JJ . If you took the time to listen you could hear the hurt in their music . " " Well , the troubles ' re in my music . " Slim was slipping on his jacket . " You 're a fool . "  | " Maybe , " Slim said with patience , " but how come you like to look at ships too ? You ai n't shuckin ' me none . " Time took a deep breath . He had met Slim in a Frankfort bar ; they had been discharged the same day and had been together since . " Man , do n't go . " " Melvin , I got to go . " Time nodded . He placed his hands in his pockets . " Okay , baby , if that 's the way it is . " He turned and , snatching his jacket , walked out . Iris went after him . " What the hell are you following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm not . You 're just going my way . " " Well , come the hell up beside me and walk like you got sense . " " Okay . " " He 's a fool . " " Yes . " " I 'm a fool for wanting him to stay when he said he'sgotta go . " " Yes . " He glanced at her . " And you 're a fool . " " Yes . " " What 'd you have , yes ' for breakfast ? " " Yes . " " To hell with him . I 'm never going home . Raggedy-assed States . I suppose you 'll be going soon too ? " " Not right away . " He stopped quickly . Iris had already moved on a pace . " You 're working , Homefolks . You 're cookin ' . Been getting some nice write-ups . I think we 'll be playing behind you soon . " He paused . " That 's what you want , is n't it ? "  | " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They started walking again . " Pretty soon it 'll be Iris Stapleton in big letters . C'm on , " he said swerving off into a bistro , " let 's drink on it . " When Slim left , Time dropped the horn altogether . Chubby left next , to eventually return home after his new American wife finished her tour of Europe , Africa and the world . Isabel , Chubby 's wife , was fifty , had unlimited sums of money and was so tanned that she looked like papyrus that had lain too long in the sun . Crinkly . Bobby , the new drummer , was young too , and had been eager to leave a mixed Parisian group and go with an American Negro combo . Iris could not know as she stood shimmering in her cones of light from Birmingham to Berlin , Copenhagen to Capri , Bordeaux to Berlin , which of the Africans or Arabs were igniting the torches of nationalism in their homes . When she and Time listened to them they exuded the sense that all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savannas and mountains and jungles lived and would be free of the French and the British . They bellowed it out in the club cellars and from the various colleges and quarters to which they had been assigned de facto . But they cried , Iris and Time always noticed with amusement , in better French than the French and in better English than the British . And when they cried , one arm raised to pound against the sky , the other arm lay softly upon the shoulder of a colonial daughter . " How mad ! " Iris said . Time shrugged . They were in Rue Biscornet and it was dusk . All evening they had been rather silent , their laughter forced . At timesp81their hands had touched and bounded away as though they were brown squirrels . When their legs had touched under the table there had been an instant 's shock and then a casual drawingaway , an averted gaze , a sudden , too sudden animation . They had raved about the dinner , though it had n't been special , and about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much time discussing the arak served by the Arabianrestaurant . And they both drank too quickly and too much , so that Time occasionally bellowed , " Hail , Jomo Kenyatta ! " at which point the Arabs turned and smiled and the two or three Africans , who looked , Iris had observed , like the British version of the Mau Mau , turned , nodded , smiled and sipped their milky liquids in a toast . And so , walking along slowly , their bodies loose and listless Time said , " Girl , why do n't you stop messing with me ? " " What ? " Iris said , and then walked on at a more rapid pace , but he caught up and pulled her back by her shoulder . She stopped and leaned backward . " I 'm not messing with you , " she said . " You 're messing with me . " They stood motionless , he straight , she leaning against him , faces pointed in the same direction . Iris looked up at the sky , the stars ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not messing with you . . . . " " You 're very high , are n't you ? " Time said , " You 're looking damned good tonight . " Still motionless she said , " Lookin ' pretty good yourself , boss . " Now they began to walk again ; she watched him but he would n't look at her until they arrived at the hotel . Standing at the door of her room he said , " Okay , let 's stop messingp82with each other . See you tomorrow . " He turned and climbed the stairs to the second floor where Bobby and Leonard also had their rooms . Iris sat a long time in her slip . When the phone rang she accepted an invitation to go out with the editor of Le Jazz Revue Hot ; it would help her publicity , she told herself as she dressed . When she was ready and standing at the mirror , letting the editor wait in the lobby , she told herself over and over again , Goddamn right I 'm looking mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out ; she was sure the noise could be heard even on the second floor . Iris was fond of Stockholm and always hated to leave it , but they had to that evening after closing at the Koncerthus . But at the moment they sat in the Stallmastergarden , working their way through the smorgasbord lunch . She was already on the meat course and paused to stare around at the pools and the gardens . Several faces looked familiar ; they might have been the same jazz-loving faces or the expatriate faces that she had seen all over Europe , rising up out of the darknesslike the white bellies of fish . She felt a curious impatience ; why was she no further along than she was ? How long did it take to become what ? A star . She was a star , but she meant a bigger one ; big enough to cause a tight fit to the image she 'd already formed for herself . " What 're you thinking , I-Iomefolks ? " Time asked . In the past months he had devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke , but without really looking at her . She noticed this again . " Nothing , " she said , and then she noticed that he lookedp83at her , really looked at her , briefly to be sure , but for the first time in months . When they finished at the Koncerthus they moved overlandto Goteborg to play the Green Hat . The third day there Time called a meeting ; he had received a telegram from Stockholm . Iris sat beside him on his bed ; business meetings were always neutral things . Leonard and Bobby sat opposite in chairs . The long , long hours of daylight and the still too bright night had left them tired , but they knew something of importance had happened even before the waiter pushed open the door to bring in the champagne . " We go back to Stockholm , " Time said , " when we finish this gig . " They waited politely until the waiter had poured the wine . " Man , " Leonard said when the waiter had withdrawn , " we are n't drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Berns . " He looked at Iris . " Josephine Baker is closing . Patachou was there before her . " Bobby and Leonard were also looking at Iris , who dropped her eyes and remained rigid . Iris wanted to bounce to her feet and scream with joy . She already saw herself standing before the couple of thousand people Berns held . And , at last , she was close enough behind Baker to be compared to her and to be proved better or different , at least . Baker was an institution ; Iris raising her eyes and smiling a little , knew that she could only be different . " Yeh , baby , " Bobby was saying to Time , " but how 's about the bread ? " Time emptied his glass , poured another . " Great . " " Nice , " Leonard said , rising . " I do n't much give a damn if I never leave Sweden . These broads are too fine.  | " That all ? " Bobby asked . He stood too . " Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later . " Bobby and Leonard went out . " The Swedes like you , Homefolks . This gig at Berns should make you . I 've got some ideas about your songs . " " Do they really like me ? " " Listen , Berns would n't pay the bread they 're paying unlessthey did . " He hesitated . " Everybody likes you . " He looked at her . She was staring into the space across the room . She said , " Time ? " " Yes ? " " Is this what we 've been waiting for ? " He did n't speak ; he refilled her glass . " Hold me , " she said . " I feel so good . " " What do I want to hold you for ? " He finished his drink in a gulp . " Ca n't you ever stop being wise ? " They studied each other . Time rose , and as he pushed the serving cart outside and locked the door , he said , without looking at her , " Iris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to shake me up . " Now he returned . " But I 'm through messing around . " " It 's you who 's going to hurt me , " Iris said . She was n't sure that she meant it , but his words rang softly inside her . " But hold me anyway . " She waited in the wings and snapped her fingers . Bobby flashed a smile at her . The warming up was Time 's idea . Let the trio work out for three numbers , loosen up ; they 'd be ready when Iris came on , just in time to change the pace.  |p85A|p|plause  sounded on Time 's dying chord . A tuxedoed announcerstrode out , addressed the audience in Swedish . Iris swept out on stage with what Time later described as a cool majesty . " Do it , baby ! " Time whispered as she went by , gown rustling . It was in the air that night ; whatever magic show people look for . The clapping died away . Iris dropped her eyes , inclined her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right on cue , Time began the intro to " Lover Man . " Iris waited , raising her eyes outward to the farthermostreaches of the house , taking in the splotches of white faces fuzzy against the darkness ; they were like dulled silver trophies fastened to a wall . She listened to Time and knew that he felt it too ; they all did . God , he 's wailing , she thought with a smile . When she began to sing she recalled the traditionwhich she had never considered before : the tradition of Bessie , Dinah , Lena , Jo and Ella . " Work , baby ! " Time whispered . " Work ! " She sang beyond them , far past their upturned , blurred faces ; she sang out there and delighted in the tremolo which crept into her voice in the low registers as though it had been there always awaiting a summons . And then , softly pursuing the ending , she was aware of her posture , as though standing before a mirror and being pleased with herself . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " her voice dying at the uttering of each word . She drew a deep breath and felt her breasts rise slightly , straining against the new fitted gown . The applause began , expanded and went on and on . Out there in the dark , people were standing beside their tables calling to her.  | " Thank you . Thank you , " she said into the mike , feigning breathlessness . She turned to Time , who sat erect , a wide grin on his face . " Man , " Leonard said , " listen to them cats , will you ? " The applause continued , but Time had begun to play again . The house became quiet . " My ship has sails that are made of silk . . . . " She sang . Irisknew when she had finished that this number had gone over even better than the first . Later when it was all over and Time , his arm around her waist , walked with her down the carpeted hall to their room , neither speaking , she knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it . It was as if she had all her life rehearsed being a success . She stepped gracefully , commandingly into it without a conscious change of pace , pausing only occasionally to wonderwith some amusement what Sissie would think of the suites she demanded and into which she allowed Time . As the years passed , she began to feel irritation at the free-swingingway he came and went . What would Sissie think , she wondered , of the brocaded cloths and the long perspectives of silver ; the porcelain and Dresden and bone china ? What would she think of the maids and the butlers , the tailored suits and the closets filled with shoes , of the bowing and scraping  --  that 's what Sissie called it when people went out of their way to be nice to you just because you were important  --  whichwent on wherever Iris went ? Sometimes on the beaches  --  Algarve , Monte Carlo , Rapallo , Costa Brava  --  it all seemed to Iris a betrayal of her past . Time , suspecting her mood , would ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p87or  a penny for your thoughts . She would smile . " What bag am I working out of ? " And relapse into silence . They flew more often as the schedule became heavier . To the same clubs to perform before the same audiences . The same people asked for the same songs . Everything was the same . ExceptTime ; he was always looking for the new , discovering new numbers , talking to strangers . Iris wondered why he would stay constant to her . Why do I let him upset me ? she asked herself . But why do I feel cut off when he 's with me ? God , she thought , do n't let him ask me to marry him . Ralph and April had been divorced ; the thought of them recurred to Iris constantly . What was he doing in New York ? Why did n't he ever write what he was doing ? She sat down that day and wrote to Ralph . There was a point at which boredom set in , and more than that , anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more often . The week-long stands continued with their two , three performances a day . It took five years for it to get to Iris . Suddenly , at Monte Carlo , angry tired and bored , she told Time to cancel out for the next three months . She saw in Leonard 's and Bobby 's eyes , and even Time 's , a silent contempt ; they think that I 've become a prima donna , she thought . " Suddeny I 've become exhausted , " she said . " No , nothing ever happens too suddenly if you 're colored , " Time answered sadly . " All I know is I 'm tired . I 've got to rest . " Bobby and Leonard returned to Paris and Iris and Time went to Castelldefels , within easy reach of Barcelona . Here near the sea that she loved she was able to rest . She took longp88walks along the coast ; sometimes with her maid Beatrice , or with Time . The mountains loomed in the background . It was off-season and so they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talking or just listening to the ocean licking across the beach . Time allowed no music except for the radio ; he even did without his piano . Mornings began with the sound of Beatrice working in the kitchen : soon after the pop of the milkman 's scooter echoed among the pine groves . No sooner were they at breakfastthan they saw through the window the one-armed postman coming down the street on his ancient bicycle . The postman was a veteran of the war ; they paid him a peseta for each piece of mail he brought . The important mail they picked up in town , for outside the larger cities of Spain mail was treated as casually as everything else . " Mariana my ass , " Time muttered from day to day . During the siesta they invariably wound up in bed , talking , smoking , resting and once more making love . Time was fascinated by the bullfights , particularly the matadors . " We could make a fortune if we only had a colored bullfighter to manage  --  El Matador Negro  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " A letter came from Ralph saying he was thinking of traveling ; if he did he would look her up . One day they were sitting on the balcon , watching the mountains change color . Above them the clouds lay in soft whorls , the sea misted . The shadows of the pines grew longer and in the sunken garden surrounding the house the insects became quiet . Iris sensed that Time was thinking , thinking that she would certainly say yes . She turned to him , seeing the dying sun glisten on his bald head . She was suddenlyp89aware of how swiftly the years had passed . He had had some hair when she had first met him . " Time , " she said . " Yes , baby ? " " I do n't want to get married yet . " " Why not ? " " Because I have n't made it all the way . " " Oh , I see ! What way are you going ? " he said sarcastically . The two great German shepherds that lived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains . " I knew it . I knew it a long time ago . Listen , I wanted to marry you and maybe even go back home . It 's something I always looked forward to . I never wanted to be an old jazzman dropping dead from a heart attack . But goddamn , Homefolks , why would you do this to me ? " " I 'm sorry . I 've thought about it for a long time . " " You 've thought about yourself . You had that when I first saw you . " She said , " Time , I do love you  --  " " I know all about that kind of love . " " Why ca n't we go on like this ? " she asked . " I wanted more , " he said . " There 's only the difference of a piece of paper . " He looked directly at her . " That 's the difference I wanted . " She could only say , " And I do n't . At least not now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice low and filled withhumiliation . The tears came . " I do n't know . I ca n't tell you because I just do n't know ! " " Beatrice is waiting , " Time said.  |p90The  applause was dry and hesitant , then burst into a sustainedexplosion . Iris sat realizing that Ralph had made it , and on his own terms , here in America . Her hands hurt from clapping . The entire play had had the kind of symmetry she would have known instantly as Ralph 's . " Like it ? " Eve asked gently . Iris nodded . Her eyes were wet . Where had it come from , she wondered . Why had she been unable to see this talent in Ralph ? Flow much had April and Eve to do with it ? Adela ? The one who sent him the money ? And Sissie and Dad , had they contributed anything ? " " I want to call him , " Iris said nervously . " I wish I could have been here opening night . And I wish he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Iris paused . " Most of it 's luck . " She hoped she did n't sound jealous . " He tried so hard to get Sissie and Oliver to come , " Eve said . " He took it pretty badly . " " I can hear Mother now : Come all that way for a little of play ? ' Did n't she say something like that ? " Iris lifted her coat ; they were standing now , waiting to get into the aisle . " They never seem to understand , " she said . " Or maybe they are afraid . " Eve did n't speak . " A drink after I make the call ? " Iris asked . " All right , " Eve said . But Iris was already shoving and squeezing through the crowds , anxious to get to the phone booths .   " I 'M SO PROUD , RALPH , SO PROUD , " Iris said into the telephone . " Thank you , baby . " " Any word from California ? " " Not a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and lingered a moment at the window . He turned up the volume on the radio , and then he thought of Iris as he had created her in his play and of her in the audience , watching . The play had cost him a lot ; how much he was only beginning to know . He had had one dollar , two escudos and ten pesetas when his ship had docked two years ago in New York . He hadP94also had a single slug . When he had finished in customs he walked out of the buzzing pier building , past the porters , through the line of yellow cabs hurtling in from the avenue between the steel beams of the West Side Highway , to a phone booth across the street . He placed his knapsacks on the ground , took out the dime-sized slug whose hole he 'd covered with Scotch tape and called Sherry . When he finished the call , he picked up his sacks , walked to the corner and lit a cigarette . He stared across the avenue at the ship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be before he would leave the States again . He was suddenly weary as all the sounds of the city began to assail him . Then came the final whistle of a liner about to depart ; impatiently he turned , looking for a cab . There were none . He had thought much about Sherry the last three days . He had n't wanted things to work out as they had , cabling her for money from Venice and later from Cote d'Azur and Barcelona . But they had and what the hell . A helluva way to come back , he mused . Unmet , penniless . No crowds , no limousines , and the same harsh West Side facade of the city . He thought about Sherry again , and knew then that she knew him better than he knew himself , the bitch . A cab approached , slowed and swerved to the curb . " Hello , Ralph , " Sherry said , standing beside the cab , holding the door open . " Sherry , " he said , and he started to smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they stepped apart she looked at him strangely . In the cab she said , " Are you so glad to see me ? "  | " Yes , " he said , taking her hand . He was surprised that he was not lying . " I stayed home yesterday and today , of course , to straighten the place up . It 's been a mess since you left . " " Has it ? " She was telling her version of the truth . Sherry was an orderly woman . She turned to him . " Ralph , I missed you so much . " " And I missed you . " When they pulled up before Sherry 's Village apartment , Ralph busied himself with his bags until Sherry had paid the fare . Instinctively , Ralph looked at his hand to see if he 'd remembered to place the wedding band on before he left the ship . He had , and now he noticed that Sherry was wearing hers too . Graham , the doorman , approached to take the bag . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ralph told the doorman . The blueuniformedNegro smiled . " Have a nice trip ? " " Great . " " Good to see you back . " " Thanks . " Sherry had got the apartment when her white roommate married . Only occasionally , when new personnel from the renting agent came around was there some minor testing . Sherry stood her ground and became known as " the colored girl , " or the " nice colored girl in number thirty-four in our number ten building . " Then she got " married . " Now the agent was hoping Sherry and her " husband " would move before they started having children . But all in all , from the agent 's point of view , the Joplins were not bad people . Ralph , P96the agent understood , was a playwright and she was a social worker . Could n't quibble with that too much . Anyway , not as long as the rent was paid and the parties were n't too wild . " It feels strange , " Ralph said as they rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " delicious . " " And you , " she said , when they left the car , " look equally delectable . A little thinner , no ? " Ralph shrugged . " I do n't know . " He watched her walk into the apartment ahead of him . " And you look just as fine as you ever did , " he said , sliding his bag across the floor and reaching for her , " maybe finer . " " Did you miss me ? " " The last three days , " he said , pulling her across his lap , " were hell . I wanted to be here already . Before then , sometimes I was so busy looking ... but I 'd always run into things , landscapes , and I 'd think , Man this would knock of Sherry out . Sherry smiled . " I wondered if you thought often of me . " " You have my letters . " " Yes , but I did n't know if they were the being-kind type of letters or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . " She pressed her lips against his neck . He waited . " It 's always been hard to tell with you , " she said . He had spent a lot of time writing the letters . There was so much to see and do that he early found it hopeless to sit down and work on the plays . All of his creative effort went into the letters he sent to her . He shook her ; she had settled dreamily in his lap . " Let 's go for a walk , " he said . " Dinner 's ready , " she answered . " I know it 's too early , but I thought you might want a good , home-cooked meal . "   " And so I do , but we just finished lunch . Early , before we came in . " " Ralph ? " " Yes , Sherry ? " " Are you restless so soon ? " He rose and walked to the window . The Women 's House of Detention was across the street . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bars until you started looking upwards . He pushed the curtains back in place and stood looking at Sherry . The fan hummed , for though it was late in the fall , Indian summer had come . " Yes , " he said . " I am restless already . " " I make you restless , " she said . " I make myself restless . " " That too . " " Anxious to get back to work . " He glanced at her . " Nothing , I suppose from Anna ? " Anna was his agent . " No . I 'd have let you know right off . " " Sure . " " Have you changed ? " " Me ? No . " Sherry rose . " Watch out , New York . Ralph 's back . He 'll cultivate you and use you and grind you underfoot . " " Oh , drop it . " " Does it surprise you that I know ? " " No . " " I have n't done wrong ? " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She shrugged . " You 've been as honest as you can be . That 's a family trait , is n't it , making mincemeat out of people ? " " Shut up . "  | " Sorry . " " I did n't write the rules . " " I know . I understand . " " C'm on , do n't give me that superior , black middle-class pity. , , " That was supposed to be understanding . " " Somehow , when it comes from you it sounds like pity . " " That 's because my mother was fair and my father adoctor . Do n't you remember ? Did you forget to say that ? " " I did n't want to say it . " She pretended surprise . " You have changed . " He stepped toward her and held her by the arms . " I did n't want to fight with you the first day back ; I did n't want to fight with you ever again , but since you want to lay cards on the table  --  could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to ? Are n't you trying to justify your behavior , your taking me back ? I mean , baby , you transfer the blame from yourself to me , and I suppose it 'll be all right in a few minutes , but those ' re the cards . " " I hate your ass , " she said , trying to twist away from him . " Look , " he said , feeling very safe because what he was going to say seemed a long way off . " I need to know that you and I can make it , that we can go from here to maybe something better . " " Maybe ! Maybe ! Maybe ! " she said her eyes bright with both hope and anger . " My whole life is maybe . What do you want from me ? " " Ralph , I hate you . God , I hate you . " He struck her . Startled , he stared at her , wanting to touch her , but knowing by the look on her face that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He left the apartment . Hep99took the stairs down two at a time . At the street he hurried to Sheridan Square and sat down on one of the half-empty benches . He wished he had n't come back . A silly wish ; he had to come back . Why had it all gone wrong ? Why ? Because he had crawled back under that masculine guise used in the phone booth ( " Baby , pick me up at Twelfth Avenue and Forty-sixth Street . Just back . Hurry . " ) when there was nothing , not a goddamn thing under it ? A man made his own way . He thought of the clinic . He would get into one in a hurry ; a big hurry . Sherry walked into the park from the Seventh Avenue side . She had put on slacks and she wore white sneakers . Her eyes were sad , and she was pouting . She sat down beside him and dug for her cigarettes ; he held a light . " Did I hurt you ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " always manage to hurt me . Listen , " she said , pulling out sun glasses and putting them on , " Ralph , do you think we could make it ? Maybe ? " He did n't look at her . " What do you think , baby ? " " It 's never been all up to me . Not once . " He said softly , " I think it 's always been up to you . Now , if you want me to answer the question . . . " His mind leaped and buzzed with image crowding on image : City Hall and maybe a honeymoon ( borrow a cottage from a friend who owned one in East Hampton ) making it up with Sherry 's folks ( tolerating her father who drank too much and yapped about the Omega Psi Phis ) her readmission to her society of balls , benefits , comings-out , dances ; her ever-diminishing interestin the things that mattered to him ( there had alreadyp100been her refusal to go to Europe with him ) his work , and finally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his work even though she would want him somehow to keep it because successful artists , even street niggers like himself , became in-group noble savages ; there would be children and they 'd be set in her crown of womanhood as little jewels , proof to the world ( but mostly to herself ) that she 'd been capable of motherhood . Children being what they were , poop what little time there was left , gone ! Well ? Was n't it time to indicate some form of payment for food , shelter and some clothing and , yes , some affection at times when it counted ? He looked at her and knew that he 'd never been involved with a woman unless he loved her for some thing in some way . " Yes , " he said . " I think we could make it . " Nervously she said , " Let 's say something definite  --  " A quick retort sprang to Ralph 's lips , but dribbled away unspoken when she said , " Like when your play is produced , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stared at the ground , at the faded shuffleboard lines . He thought , What an ass I am . She does n't want it anymorethan I do ! Why the damned play is still under option and it 'll take rewriting and two or three new producers , if then , and she knows it . I 've told her . We are where we were . This nebulous arrangement is no arrangement . We both remain unshackled ; there are no chains . Thank God ! And I  --  I was going to make the big sacrifice of my life . . . . " It 's a deal , baby , " he said . She embraced him happily ; she kissed him and began to chatter , like someone in love , Ralph thought , just like someone who 's supposed to be in love . Looking at her face on thep101way home , he saw an intense distant look about it , and on the elevator he wondered whether or not he should mention the possibility of her going to a clinic too . He decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to have enough to take care of himself in the months ahead . Even with " inside contact " Ralph expected to be turned away from the doors of Osgood , Overstreet and Edwards , Advertising , Inc. , but he was n't . He reported to the research department and began work as a hand-tabber . The hand tabulatingsection was made up of artists  --  actors , painters , writers , singers  --  who were at the moment out of work . Here all personnel were temporary . Management never complained of the frequent goings and comings of the " workers " off to auditions and meetings with agents . The very first day at lunch the only other Negro working there introduced himself to Ralph . " I 'm Barney Moore , " he said . He was a small , agile man who walked as though he were a heavyweight . " Ralph Joplin . " " It 's lunchtime . I 'll show you a spot . These damned Schrafft carts are too expensive and the chow is n't much . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ralph said without looking up from his food . Sherry was having one of her fits ; she had n't fixed breakfast coffee . " You ? " " I try " " What ? " " Novels . " " Plays , " Ralph said . " Published ? " " Short stuff . You ? "  | " Nothing . " " Rough , " Barney said . " Yeah . " " Well , the agency 'll keep you in a little bread ; I mean a buck and a half an hour in these times is n't much . Holds you together . And the people in our section are n't bad . Everyone'sscuffling . " " It 's pretty boring work , " Ralph said . " Do n't worry about it . You 'll get used to it . You get in about nine-fifteen , nine-twenty , and grab coffee and cake from the cart . By the time you 've finished it 's approaching ten . Go to the john about eleven . Sit there , smoke . Come out , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An hour . Three or three-thirty they send out for coffee or tea . You nuts with that for a half hour or so and already it 's four or four-thirty . You start clearing your desk  --  slowlyaboutten to five  --  and that 's your day . Somehow you manage to get some work done too . " Barney lit a cigar . " Then you hustle home and go to work . " He shook out the match . " Married ? " " No . " " That 's a break . " Ralph grinned and thought , this guy sounds just like me . " What 's funny ? " Ralph shook his head . " Just a thought I had . " " I guess we 'd better get back , " Barney said , glancing at his watch . " Ready ? " Ralph learned that Barney was twenty-eight , lived in the Village , and drank heavily . Each assured the other that they 'd have to get together for a good talk . P103As the weeks passed Ralph became accustomed to OOE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dull-redbrickbuilding . Sometimes when he worked late and passed the rows of cleaned desks , it seemed to Ralph that the next morning would bring an entirely new group of automation assistants and they too would fill the desks with Kotex , Tampax , Kleenex ; red , blue , green and brown pencils ; paper clips and the day 's papers and the current pocket-sized best-sellers . In his fifth month , as the end of winter approached , Ralph was transferred to a new job in the same section . The transferoccurred the week he had his first appointment with the psychiatric social worker at Riverside Clinic . This contact was a part of the clinic 's screening process . Ralph was not sure they 'd accept his case . He was now working with the radio-television section of the research department , in Test Audience . Test Audiences were selected daily from the Manhattan , Bronx , Queens , Brooklyn and Richmond telephone directories . Ralph listed every other name and address up to fifty or seventy-five people , then gave the list to a typist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form letters were enclosed . Three times a week Ralph worked late . Audience members usually showed up in full strength unless the weather was bad ; the form letters had promised an " inside view " of television and most attendees felt honored . Once inside the auditorium the audience was given a bookletto check its reaction to the commercials and to write answers to a variety of carefully compiled questions . Many members of the audience had come expecting something more than this , but few complained . At the end of the showing ofp104the commercials , the booklets were taken up and souvenirs were distributed . The following morning Ralph would go over the questionnaires . At home , Sherry 's period was late as usual and as usual she vacillated between abortion and marriage . As he did every month , Ralph waited and tried to ignore her dire predictions of pregnancy . But this time she accused him of planning to desert her if she were pregnant . " Sherry , dammit , I 'm trying to work . " He glared at her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked for your shirts , where are they ? Tell me that , if you are n't planning to leave . " Ralph turned back to the typewriter . It was ten-thirty and he 'd just got in from a Test Audience . " In the laundry , " he said . " Show me the slip , show it to me ! " His voice trembled . " Bring my wallet . " She brought it and started to open it . He snatched it from her . " Do n't ever open my wallet ! " " Why ? " " Because , " he said , fishing out the receipt , " it 's the only private thing I have and you keep your goddamn hands off it unless I ask you for it , and when I do , leave it closed ! " She looked at the slip and tossed it back on the table . " What about your bag ? " " What damned bag ? " " Your suitcase . " He took a deep breath . " That bag 's been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . You took it there yourself ! " " I do n't care . I 'm going to have my belly all puffed outp105and I know you 're going to leave me , and I 'll have to tell the child it has no father and  --  " Deliberately he turned back to the typewriter a second time and began pecking at the keys . He stopped once to say , " Will you be quiet and go to bed ? Please ? " " I 'll go , " she said , " but I 'm going to leave the door open so I can watch you . I do n't want you slipping out of here . " " Baby , go to bed . " The next day the psychiatric social worker called Ralph on the job . An appointment had been made with the psychologist , and after evaluation , analysis might begin . The following day Sherry got her period . And the day before his appointment with the psychologist Ralph moved out.  |p106THE  PSYCHOLOGIST WAS A HUGE LUMPY MAN . His face was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had cold eyes . " Come in , " he said , moving back from the door . His voice matched his appearance : dry , quick , toneless . Ralph reacted more from the situation than from the words of the man . When they were seated , the psychologist picked up some papers and looked across the desk at Ralph . " I 'll explain this to you . This series of tests will take three hours . I 'll time you for each segment of the series . Now . At the start of each segmentI 'll give you instructions . If when I 've finished them , you do n't understand , tell me and I 'll give them to you again . Is that clear ? When you indicate that you 've understood , P107I 'll say Start ' "  --  he held up a timer 's watch just then , like a pitchman , Ralph thought  --  " and then you begin . Clear ? " " Clear , " Ralph said . " Let 's begin with word association , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you will answer it with the first word that comes into your mind . Understand ? " " Yes . " Ralph tensed . In a second the warm , half-shadowed room was filled with staccato exchange of words . " Mother , " the psychologist said . " Father , " Ralph answered . " Man . " " Woman . " An hour passed . Ralph 's body ached . He began to sweat . " People , " the psychologist said . Ralph said , " Fight . " He saw the psychologist 's eyes flicker . The heavy hand , holding the pencil , did not check ; it scribbled . " Fear . " Ralph hesitated and then said , " Rats , " and as soon as he said the word he knew there was something odd about havingsaid it , something he did not understand . He answered the next words automatically , still thinking back to " Rats . " " Masturbation . " Ralph groped . " Sleep , " he said . Later when " Fight " was mentioned Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strange association . While continuing to lean forward in his chair , the psychologistput aside one of the papers . " Why did you answer People ' with Fight ' and Fight ' with People ' ? "  | " People fight , " Ralph said . He watched the man scribble . " And Fear ' with Rats ' ? " " I- do n't know why . " But then Ralph began to explain . " One morning when I was a kid , I woke up and looked at my sister  --  " " You shared the same room ? " " Yes . " " How old were you ? " " Ten and seven . " " Go on . " " A rat was eating her . " The man waited . " The side of her face , " Ralph said . " Now the next test , " the psychologist said . His voice was still dry , his eyes cold , and Ralph was angry that he had had to explain to this man . " I hesitated for another word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's get on , shall we ? " Another hour had passed . Ralph stared intently at the cards passed to him one at a time by the psychologist . " What do you see in that one ? " His voice conveyed a sense of urgency , strain . " Two servants . Their clothes are not very good . Torn , in shreds . They 're on their knees . " The psychologist scribbled , took the card and handed Ralph another . " And this ? " Ralph took the card and turned it slowly around . He tilted his head . What he had perceived upon first looking at the card remained . " Yes ? " " They are "  --  Ralph said , slowly , hating the sound of his words ,  --  " caricatures of  --  of guffawing Negroes . They'rep109grinning . Their heads are wrapped in rags or handkerchiefs or  --  something . . . . " Ralph wiped the sweat on his forehead . He frowned . The psychologist wrote . He took the card from Ralph , glancing sharply at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost home , " he said . " Take a break . " He handed his pack to Ralph . " Smoke ? " Ralph was exhausted when he concluded the tests with the blocks and arithmetic segments . As he walked out , his shoulderssagging , his forehead and armpits wet with sweat , the psychologist , writing hastily at his desk , said , " Good luck . " One week later Ralph had his first session with the psychiatristassigned to him . The doctor 's name was Bluman . He was a short , broad-shouldered man in his fifties . He was bald and his unusually translucent skin made his blue eyes seem even more intense than they were . There was no couch in the office . Ralph sat in the chair beside the small oak desk . Dr. Bluman took the desk seat . He pursed his bottom lip and the sharp lines which curved from the edges of the nostrils down to his mouth tightened . " Well ! " he said , smiling at Ralph ; he 'd been well aware that his patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Bluman said , " Suppose we get started , Mr. Joplin , hmmmm ? " Ralph smiled . The doctor noted : The patient appeared self-conscious at the beginning of the initial session ... . " Freudian or Jungian , doctor ? " " Freudian . " " Can I ask what school ? " " Cornell and Columbia . Want the hospitals too , Mr. Jop-lin ? " " Is this irregular ? " Dr. Bluman shrugged and waited.  |p110Ral|ph  studied the stocky figure . " Ever play football , doc-tor ? " Bluman said , " No , tennis ; but you 've played football , have n't you , Mr. Joplin ? " " Yes . " " You 've made your point , I think , " Dr. Bluman said . " Can we get started now ? " " I feel a little awkward about this , " Ralph said . " Ummm , yes ? " Bluman gave Ralph an interested , open look . " I feel a little defeated too "  --  Ralph turned his eyes quickly toward the doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " " Why did you find it necessary ? " " Sounds corny , but  --  " " What 's that you say ? " Ralph coughed into his fist and shuffled his feet into a new position . " I said , it sounds corny . " " What do you mean , corny ' ? " " What I 'm going to say . " " You have n't said it . " " I intend to if  --  " Bluman 's eyes twinkled . He waited this time . " I 'm out of dreams . I 'm not thirty-five and I 'm not dreamingany more . I 'm at a dead end  --  He broke off , thinking with a sudden suspicion that even his speech patterns would be under analysis here . " Dreams ? " " Confidence in myself . " " Oh . Then you do n't mean dreams ; you mean your confidenceis gone . "  | " I guess so . " " Why is it gone ? " " Because I 'm Negro . " Ralph waited for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given some thought to his problem , but may have evaded the real reason for it ... . " But I exist ; I breathe and think , and I can do ; I want to do . I want to live . I want everything that living means . I want to be useful . I want to look at people and not wonder when or with what foot they 'll try to kick me in the tail . " Ralph found himself looking down at his shoes as he said , " I want to be able to love . " The tiny clock on the desk ticked in the silence . " I am a human being , " Ralph said , still looking downward as if in casual meditation , " and therefore I am important , not only to myself , but to every other human in the world . I am due a chance at the life I conceived for myself if that conceptionis harmless to others . But there is a force , doe , which activates wherever I go , whenever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ralph raised his eyes to the doctor 's , indicating that he had finished . " I see , " Bluman said . " Do you ? " " I mean  --  you 've stated what you think your problem is . .. . Why did you preface your remarks with it sounds corny ' ? " " It seems unmanly to talk about these things ; to me it does . The game seems to be that you pay for the privilege of getting a shot in the head , but you never squawk about it ; you take it until you ca n't do it anymore . Then you start getting rid of yourself . Quietly , out of the way , in some place that'sp112proper , like , for me , Bedford-Stuyvesant or Harlem , preferablywith a police bullet or of an overdose of heroin . People feel better if you go that way , uncomplaining . " " Do you think you 're unmanly , Mr. Joplin ? " " Hell no , just goddamn desperate . " The clock ticked on . A cold draft blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and watched the branches of the tree in the yard below sway menacingly . The patient insists that the origin of his problem is racial ... . " Had you thought , " Dr. Bluman asked , " that your problem is a result of your personality rather than your race ? " It was spring now . The office window was opened and the low afternoon sun appeared to lie on the sill . Work at OOE had run out and Ralph was working desperately , excitedly , on the last phases of the current rewrite of Shadows ; the prospectsof an actual purchase seemed imminent . Even Anna was excited ; she had taken Ralph to lunch three times that week , and always , after the third Martini , she luxuriated in thoughts of a long run on Broadway and a movie . Her mood was contagious . The excitement helped Ralph get over the fact that he was unemployed . He had spent the night before drinking with Barney Moore ; unemployment had finally brought them together . Barney had had a good nibble on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with new assuranceabout many things . Ralph 's stomach rumbled ; he was eating one big meal a day now . " My personality ? " he echoed . " But doctor , the point is , is n't it , that my personality 's been molded because of my race ! " After the first month of therapy Ralph had called him " doc , " but had quickly returned to the more formal " doctor "  |p113in  order to re-establish the barrier Ralph wished between them . " We 're interested in the area of your personality , " Dr. Bluman said . " Now why did you eat garlic in school ? " " So the teacher would n't keep me too long after school . It was only after school that I ate it . " " You were always sent home early ? " " Yes . " " With notes ? " " Yes . " " Did you destroy the notes ? " " No . I gave them to my mother . " " Your mother ? " " Yes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told you , he 'd gone by then . " " Oh , yes , that 's right . " Patient showed signs of checking his temper when asked again about his father . . . . " Well , what 'd she do ? " " She raised hell . " " She spank you ? " " Once or twice she beat me . " " Beat you ? Did n't she spank you ? What do you mean , beat ' ? " " We seldom were hit with her hand . " " What then ? " " Straps , boards , switches .... " " All right . After she beat you , then what ? " " After a couple of times I guess she got tired . Looked dis-gusted . " " What 'd you do to be made to stay after school anyway ? "  | " I do n't remember ; now it seems no more than anyone else . " " Using the garlic to get out of staying late  --  was n't that abit extreme ? And did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got used to it . It did n't bother me and  --  " " Mr. Joplin , consider : you took the garlic to school with you ; you set up a chain of events in which you did something to make the teacher keep you , and when she did you ate the garlic and she sent you home with a note . To your mother . You were n't just carrying garlic around in your pocket every day , were you ? " " Dr. Bluman , you see  --  " " I guess our time 's up for this afternoon , Mr. Joplin . See you on Friday , same time . " Patient has moved from the general to the less general ; he is discussing his family .... " It seemed that what I wanted to do was some sort of violationof family ethics ; all I wanted to do was learn . I did n't know what the hell I was going to do with it . My teachers encouraged me ; but at home , nothing . " " Your teachers were white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . " " And they gave you the only encouragement you got ? " " Yes . " " Are you sure , Mr. Joplin ? " " Dr. Bluman , I 'm quite , quite positive . " A pair of sparrows streaked past the windows ; a soft , hot wind stabbed into the room and the bright green leaves of theP115elm tree rustled . " I ca n't pay the clinic this week , " Ralph said . He looked down at his shoes . " Oh , " Dr. Bluman said . " Do you want me to pay the fee for you this week ? " " No ! " Ralph shot straight up in his chair , staring . " Was n't that your thought , Mr. Joplin ? If I pay your fee , encourage you , you 'll go on to better things ? I 'm white , Mr. Joplin . " " That 's not what I meant , " Ralph said unsteadily . " Money 's always been a problem for me . I have an obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want a solution , not charity . The thought just crossed my mind . " " Then why did n't you discuss it with the young woman in the office ? " The doctor 's eyes swept swiftly to the clock on the corner of his desk . " That 's all for today . " Had that been his thought after all ? Ralph wondered as he walked slowly to the clinic office . He had thought that he had down pat all the methods by which a problem comes to be stated through free association . In his mind he traced the conversation , checked the points in it where his direction had been specifically marked . But he refused to believe , even when he acknowledged the obvious path , that his thought had been to have Bluman pay for his hour . The young woman Dr. Bluman had referred to was clearingher desk , but paused when Ralph entered . " Mr. Joplin ? " she said with a smile . Then Ralph remembered seeing her in the office before . " Hello , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to speak . " Look , I ca n't pay for the visit today . And maybe not for the next one . "  | " Oh , that 's all right , " she said . " Pay when you can . " " Really ? " " Yes , did n't anyone tell you ? " Ralph straightened . " I suppose so . I just forgot about it . I 'll keep account . " " That 'll be fine , Mr. Joplin . Do n't worry about it . " Ralph wondered if she had access to his files ; if she hadread them and what she was now thinking of him . " Wereyou leaving ? " he asked . " I 'll say , " she said , glancing at the tiny string of gold , her watch . " It 's after five . " She rose . " I 'm just going myself , " he said , moving away , staring down into her eyes . " Good , you can walk downstairs with me . " He stood aside to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she preceded him down the steps . On the walk outside , she stopped to smile goodbye . " Which way do you go ? " Ralph asked . " I take the Seventh Avenue . " " Up or down ? " She hesitated . " Down . " " So do I. Let 's go . " She hesitated again and glanced up at the building . " All right . " " What 's your name anyway ? " Ralph asked . " Miss Cannady . " " I guess I 'm not supposed to get the first one . " " No . " Ralph stopped . She walked on a few steps . When he had rejoined her he said , " Well , what is your first name ? " " Why do you want it ? " she insisted.  | " Oh , for Christ 's sake . What 's the big deal with your first name ? To hell with you . " He lengthened his stride , moved quickly away from her , but when he got to the corner he stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Sometimes it 's so damned hard to get to know people . " She gave him an arch look . " You 've got yourself a temper , Mr. Joplin . " " Ralph , " he said . " I know . " " I thought you knew . " She blushed . " My name 's Eve . We 're not supposed to be involved in any way with the patients . " " Am I supposed to be violent or something ? " " I have n't read your chart . Are you ? " " No , " he said . " I 'll look tomorrow . " She looked at him . " No , I wo n't . I could n't if I wanted to . " He seemed relieved . " How 's it going anyway ? " " I do n't know yet . " They went down into the subway and sat in silence until the train got to Fifty-ninth Street . Eve rose . " This is where I get off , " she said . " Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes showed that she did n't believe him , he said , " Honest . I change and take the D train here . " " Where do you live ? " she asked , moving close to him asthey made their way through the restless crush of people . " Third Street , " he said loudly , so she could hear him . " Oh , no , " she said . He started to smile . " You live down there ? " " Yes ! " she shouted . The A train had just come hurtling in.  | " Where ? " he asked , when they were in the passageway beneath the tracks . " I 've told you too much already . Listen you , I have a boy friend , anyway . " " Oh , yes ? " " An actor ! " she shouted . " Too bad ! " Ralph shouted back . She glanced at him quickly , and smiled . On the train , he said , " Have some coffee with me when we get off . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " No ! " she said , terrified . " I meant I get off at Second Avenue too . " " Well , what about the coffee ? " " No . I have to rush and dress for Henri . " " Henri Catroux ? That your boy friend ? " She nodded proudly . " I got a thing for Catroux , " Ralph said . " What do you mean , thing ' ? " " A play . " She looked at him carefully . " What 's wrong , am I dirty , or black or something ? " " No . Are you kidding ? " " No , " Ralph protested with a smile . " Henri 's been looking for something with teeth in it . " After a pause , Ralph tapped her on the shoulder . " Isn'tCatroux supposed to be in England finishing up something ? " With a sigh she said , " Yes . " " Did you have to lie ? " " Well , we are supposed to be going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy about it . " He paused . She said nothing . " Now how about the coffee ? " " What 's the big deal about coffee ? " They both laughed . " It 's really not the coffee . " " You should go to the clinic every day instead of only twice a week . " " I 'm nuts ? " " You 're nuts . " " And the coffee ? " " All right already with the coffee . Are you always so persistent ? " " Never before , " he said as they got off the train , and started up the steps . Patient indicates a willingness to explore his relations with siblings .... " You went every Sunday ? " " Nearly every Sunday . Roller-skated . Once I took my sister Iris . " He waited a moment before saying , " That Mary Ellen . She was sweet , happy . She liked me best of all . She 'd laugh and crawl for me when I came home from school . It made me feel good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid to do at thirteen or fourteen , was n't it ? " " You ca n't explain ? " " No . " " Come now , Mr. Joplin . " " I 've tried ! " " Perhaps you did n't want to admit the truth to yourself , Mr. Joplin . This child  --  your sister Mary Ellen  --  you avoid using the word love . ' Did n't you feel that she loved you ? " " Yes . "  | " Then why did n't you say it ? And did n't you , perhaps for the very first time , find that you could love someone too ? I think , while you know love is a good thing , you basically feel it 's a weakness . " " No I do n't . " " You still wo n't tell me why you roller-skated nearly five miles every Sunday to sit beside your baby sister 's grave ? " " I do n't know why ! " Patient expressed controlled anger again when pressed for an answer ... . Ralph stared past Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green lawn . The picture was framed with polished black wood . " Could it have been that you wanted to join in death the little sister who loved you and whom you loved in return ? " Ralph was silent . Dr. Bluman said quietly , " It 's not uncommon , Mr. Joplin . " After a brief hesitation Ralph said , " Can we cut this one short , doctor ? " " Do n't leave it , " Dr. Bluman said . He had considered using " run "  --  Do n't run , but a small goad would perhaps do more harm than good at the moment . The patient 's tendency to react angrily could make what was coming into focus recede . " We might put the time left to good use , especially since this is the last session until fall . " " I 've nothing more to say . " " You have . Why did you take your other sister , Iris , with you ? You did n't go back to the cemetery after that Sunday you took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at him ; he thought , then said , " No . " " Why not ? " Ralph spoke haltingly . " Because I accepted the love she hadp121for me "  --  he looked up questioningly at the doctor 's impassiveface.  --  " and I transferred the love I had for Mary Ellen to her . " Dr. Bluman nodded . " It was a good thing , was n't it ? Otherwise .... " Now they sat in silence . Ralph smoked . His mind was unclear  --  turbulent . Dr. Bluman 's eyes flicked to and from the clock . " Our time is up now . I suggest that you call the office if you want to continue in the fall . If you do , you can be fitted right in . " Without looking at him Ralph asked , " Will you be back , doctor ? " " Yes , I 'll be back . " They shook hands and Ralph walked slowly into the first days of summer , everything in turmoil . During the summer he thought of his sessions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anxious . Ralph sat in the almost unfurnished flat on Third Street working twelve hours a day . The sun poured in through the uncurtained windows . The noise on the street below never stopped . Twice Sherry visited him and they fell upon one another hungrily . But somehow or other she always departed in a temper , and always she teased him about money . He needed it . His unemployment checks brought him twenty dollars a week , leaving thirty dollars a month for food . When the superintendent of the building quit , Ralph took on the job . This paid him a small salary and he got his rooms free . Ralph collected the trash and put out the heavy steel cans in the early morning . Barney helped him mop the hall floors once a week . One of the first tenants he becameP122acquainted with was Mrs. Scalzone . " Good morning , " she would say as she passed him walking her Pekinese . She left notes in his box asking him to repair the lock on her door , a shelf in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Scalzonewas a widow of fifty . Her eyes and hair were dark ; she had a pretty , round face which had begun to wrinkle slightly . One hot summer morning , Ralph sat at his typewriter sweating out another drunken night with Barney , who had n't stopped talking about his quiet , golden girl from Pakistan . Barney had tried everything to get Jane to marry him  --  had even jabbed holes in her diaphragm . Then Barney had confessedwith some embarrassment that his novel had been bought . The statement left Ralph jealous and disconsolate ; Anna had n't yet completed the deal on his play . Now she doubted that it would even be sold . " What 's your novel about  --  that old tired nigger shit ? " Ralph had said , but had not meant it to sound as bitter as it had . Now he sat in the heat , his head buzzing , thinking of the night before . The heat made him conscious of his poverty ; anyone who had money fled New York in the summer . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of sex . But with whom ? The thought of Eve entered his mind . But Catrouxstood between them , even though he was out of the country . His mind came to rest on Sherry . He had only to call her office and say into the phone , " Sherry , I must see you ! " Ralph frowned as he thought of Mrs. Scalzone . There was nothing wrong with her shelf ; the handle of the gas range ? They were made so they could be slid off and replaced . Ralph put out his cigarette , wiped the sweat from hisp123face and torso , pulled on a shirt and went downstairs . He knocked on Mrs. Scalzone 's door . Her Pekinese barked . " Who is it ? " she sang out . " The super , " he answered , not too loudly . " Oh ! " She opened the door . " Come in . " Ralph heard the lock snap shut behind him . " I wanted to look at your shelf again , " he said , realizing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Scalzone was wearing a close-fitting blouse and dark shorts . Ralph saw a harsh , dark vein running down the inside of one of her thighs . " Go right ahead , " she said . The Pekinese sniffed belligerentlyat Ralph 's trouser cuff . It looked at its mistress , then guardedly pranced alongside Ralph as he walked to the kitchen . " Very hot today , " she said , following him . " Yes , " Ralph said , examining the shelf . " Like some iced coffee ? You 've been working since seven this morning in all this heat . " He was touched by her concern . " Fine , thanks . " She wore a light , conspiratorial perfume which wavered above the scent of prosciutto . Ralph allowed his hand to drop from the shelf . He turned slowly . Her face , strained with a close-lipped smile , was less than an inch away . He watched her eyes drop to his lips ; he saw the slender dark veins in her lowered lids . Her throat pulsed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which separated their mouths . He felt her welcome when he kissed her . The Pekineseretired to a corner and curled up . " I do n't even know your name , " she said later , " but it does n't matter . You had the look of loneliness about you andp124now you look content . I  --  I am happy . I was alone too . " She sighed . " In a few years those things which made you only content will make you happy . " Ralph wanted to say I love you . I was lonely , and I was tired . You saw , you were there ; you understood . You 're rare . Instead he said , " My name 's Ralph . " " Georgia 's mine . " " I must go , " he said . " Yes . " " The people in the building .... " " Yes . " The Pekinese sniffed the air with its puzzled expression . Ralph took her hand . " Goodbye , Georgia . " He restrained himself from saying Thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Goodbye , " she said . He kissed her lightly ; her kiss was light also . Toward the end of a dull succession of summer days and nights , Ralph received a call at three in the morning from Barney . " Barney , dammit , you 're drunk . " " So what ? Disaster strikes at ten and you bug me with beingdrunk . " " What 's happening ? " " I need you for my best man . We 're getting married at ten . " " You , " Ralph said , " and Jane ? " " Yeah , man , me and Jane . " " When did you decide this ? " " Got the license last week , but I got chicken . Jane caughtp125up with me last night , Man , you do n't know how hard I 've been running the last week . " " I noticed you were n't around to help with the mopping , you bastard . " " Get off me . I 've been had . " " Stop crying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man ? " " Will I what ? " " Be the best man ? " " Sure . Why the hell not ? " " Thanks . Meet us at St. Philip 's about quarter of , will you ? " " Sure . " Barney was late . Jane asked again , " Are you sure he was n't with you last night ? " " No , I told you he called and asked me to be here , that 's all . " " Where can he be ? " " Here he comes ! " Ralph said , and down the sun-drenched street Barney came loping , his face drawn , his eyes puffed . He hung his head as he came up . " Hello . I 'm late . " He glanced at Jane . " Let 's get it over with , " he said gruffly . She straightenedhis tie . " Are you ready ? " Barney looked hopelessly at Ralph . " I 'm ready . " They walked silently to the pastorate , and the minister , a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , bidding time and the world to note the union in crisp but solemn words , completed the ceremony . Perhaps , Ralph thought , as they returned somewhatbewildered to the street , this was the way it should be done ; unnoticed . He shook Barney 's hand.  | " Man , I guess that was it , " Barney said . Jane watched , smiling slightly . Ralph kissed her . " Good luck , baby , " he said , thinking sadly that Barney had at last obtained this substitute for the white girl he wished he could have married . " Now , " Ralph said , leading them across the street to a bar , " a toast . " When the drinks had been brought , Ralph raised his glass . " To my friends Barney and Jane , who pretended , but not well , that there was no love between them . " They drank . BecauseBarney had problems did not necessarily mean that he did not love Jane , Ralph thought . Ralph walked quickly away from them and dashed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . The man 's eyes leaped with hope as Ralph approached . " S-s-say , man , " the derelict said , " lay somethin ' on me , please . " Ralph sidled past , murmuring , " Baby , I 'm clean as chittlins . " The derelict laughed and shuffled aside . " G'one , jum , you the goddamn best . " His appreciative chuckles followedRalph all the way down the steps . Ralph wondered what the derelict 's reaction would have been had he not uttered an element of the idiom with the proper inflection . Passwords . Not just what you said , but how you said it . That 's where the white boys fell down ; they did n't know how . He passed through the turnstiles ; in this part of town the subway entrances were unencumbered by the great steel U-bars which were attached to the turnstilesin Harlem , and which sounded like great cell bars beinglifted when people went through . During the rush hour the bars rattled so loudly that the trains could hardly be heard . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat back in his chair , lit another cigarette and waited tensely for the weather report . When the announcer said that the last of the storm was in sight , Ralph ran to the telephone . " Reservations for Joplin , two , Los Angeles ; they were canceled this morning because of the storm , " the reservationclerk said . Ralph 's voice rose in anger " For Christ 's sake , did n't you say you 'd call back as soon as you got the word ? You people ought to know better about storms than us  --  are the reservations valid for the first flight out in the morning or not ? " He slammed the instrument down . He walked to the bathroom , his hands shoved deep into his pockets . Ralph let the water run hot while he fixed a drinkP128and lit a fresh cigarette . He stood before the mirror lathering , and thought with some surprise about the amount of temper he 'd shown talking to the airlines clerk . Bluman would have found it most interesting , he thought with a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking ? Of Bluman and that whole crazy time ; nutty time . The heat of the summer days had begun to ease ; there had been more people in town and the sting of being compelled to stay in the city had lessened . Henri Catroux had lain heavily across letters which Ralph received from Eve . She did n't say so , but she intended to marry Catroux in the fall , he knew . He had known it from the beginning ; why had he persisted ? Because he knew , with the instinct that was still strong in those that fight for survival , that she was it . What in the hell was Anna doing ? Why did n't she call , ask him about a million things , tell him two million things and finally say calmly that Shadows had been sold . Anna ! You bitch ! And then perhaps . . . Eve ? Wearied of the city , haunted by the sounds in his apartment and the thought of Eve , Ralph left New York and went to see his daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after an hour decided to stay only three days . Each time Ralph saw the child he was overwhelmed . He remembered that June night when April told him to call the doctor . In the hospital he had sat alone on a cold enclosed terrace , listening to April 's piercing screams . The labor had taken until morning . Inside the glass the nurse held up the child for him to see . It looked small and pale and red and not at all like either April or himself . It had been one of the rare times in his life when he had felt truly humble . P129Now when he looked at her , the wonder was coupled with reality . At what age would she have her first man ( or boy ) ? Would she know what to do ? In his mind he formed up a boy here and one there , then quickly a park with high hedges . After , a shabby hotel room . God , he thought , let April not be afraid to tell her when the time came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't disclose when , sitting upon his knee , she reached matter-of-factly between his legs , felt around , grasped and then squeezed his penis , let go and busied herself with something else . He told himself that she merely wanted to find out if he were different . Yes , yes , of course , and now she knows . Ralph did not visit his father before he left , so depressed had he become with the town and its people . Had he seen Big Ralph they would have drunk beer and talked of football . What else did they have to say to each other ? Ralph was happy to leave town . Within a week of his return to New York he had signed at the clinic for the fall and accepted work with another temporary hand-tab crew at OOE . He looked at his flat for the first time , it seemed ; it was as though he were just emerging from narcosis . The place was depressing . He looked at his rooms , then at his body which had gone slack with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , picked up the soiled clothing , cigarette butts and wrappers , balls of typing paper . The sharp obnoxious smell of stale cigarette smoke disappeared . Georgia gave him some old drapes which exuded the scent of Parodi cigars and fichi secchi , an insistent Mediterranean perfume . P130Two days later , going to the first session with Dr. Bluman , Ralph thought back to the spring and the tests he 'd taken  --  he 'd been an abysmal failure at the blocks , a blundering ass with the arithmetic . What must they have written as his diagnosis and tucked away deep in the files to be pulled out after every visit and added to ? The solution to the matching of the blocks and to the problems had been etched in his mind just from visual contact , but he had n't been able to solve the problems by doing . Instead , like items in a closet , the answers had remained in his mind . Relentlessly speeding time and an exceeding , strange weariness had caused the jam . . . . What was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . the failure to manipulatethe blocks and solve the problems indicated an inability to ( deal ? cope ? ) relate to reality . But might n't this also call up a rejection of that reality as being unworthy or unsuited or in itself unreal to the ( subject ? person ? patient ? ) Who or what made it mandatory that the reality delineated in a clinic be accepted anyway ? Was n't reality relative in the final analysis ? ( Damn that word ! ) Thus armed , Ralph bounced into the office , shook hands briskly with the doctor and sat down . Dr. Bluman automaticallynoted Ralph 's manner . Ralph , on the other hand , found the doctor tanned to the very crown of his head . Then , still studying the doctor , Ralph told about the happenings of the summer . It seemed to him that his voice carried more authority , that he even spoke with greater fluency . He thought , I sound like a man who has his problem in hand . But Eve . Eve . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why did n't you see your father ? " Ralph found himself brought up short .   " I was n't feeling too hot up there . Sort of depressed what with my daughter and the same house and my friends . I almost always feel like that . " " But sometimes you visit your father . " " When I feel well . " " What does well ' mean ? " " When things are going all right . " " Like having money ? " Ralph paused and said , " Yes . " " Did you have money ? " " Not a lot . " They fell silent for a few seconds . " What 're you thinking of ? " Dr. Bluman asked . Ralph had been thinking of Eve , but he said , " Could it be that I 'll only see my father when I 'm superior to him , when I have more money than he , when my position is unshakable ? " " What do you think ? " " Yes . " Dr. Bluman cleared his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the things you 've said most often is that you 're a better man than he ever was , in many respects . You have n't proved that to yourself yet ; you want to . But now  --  you talked about your father and then went on to your friend Barney , the fellow with the new book  --  have you felt anything about his  --  success ? " " I 'm very glad for him . He 's worked very hard . " " So 've you . " " Well , he deserves every break he gets . " " Do n't you ? Was n't that your premise when you began here ? " " I suppose so . " " You have n't felt any envy ? You have n't been comparingP132the roads both of you 've traveled ? You have n't felt jealousy that he got there first ? " " I 'm human ! " " What does that mean ? " " Of course I felt something ! " " What did you feel ? " " I told you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Look , doctor , success is relative . . . . " " You did feel something about his success then . " " I felt happy for him . " Dr. Bluman leaned back and sighed . " It 's a human condition to be reasonably jealous of the other fellow 's success , Mr. Joplin . There is a tie-in here between your feelings for your father and your friend 's book . " He paused . " And also on quite another level , consider the success of your sister in Spain . " " I do n't resent her success , " Ralph said quickly . " We 've discussed her rather often . I think you have some feelings about it . However , this is not the important area . We 're working on your statements today . " " Why in the hell should I be jealous of my father ? What kind of success has he had ? " " Time 's up for now , Mr. Joplin . But I want to say : Give some thought to thinking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try to relate it to Mrs. Scalzone ; you 've mentioned three times that she was fifty years old . " " I have ? " " That 's all . " P133Eve was waiting at the subway . But his elation died when he saw the somber look on her face . He pulled her to him and then pushed her back slowly so that he could see her eyes . She would not look at him . Instead she crossed her hands , fingers stretched across her breast ; he saw the band . " Oh , you 've done it ? " he said . " I told you I would . " " I know . I guess I kept hoping . " " I wo n't be at the clinic anymore . " " Well , if you were married to me you 'd have to work your can off . " " What about the play ? " " Still cooking . Has n't sold yet . " He glanced sharply at her . " Happy ? " She did not look at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't tell you this to make you feel better . I 'm not happy ; I did n't expect to be . " " Then why did you do it ? " " I 've known Henri for a long time ; when we were kids and he 'd just come to New York . He 's always made me feel that he needed me , even when I did n't want to be needed so much . It got to be habit with all the guilt attached . " " Eve , I need you . " " Not in the same way . I 'm not your life ; I never could be . I 'm Henri 's life . The theatre is nothing without me . Nothing is anything without me and it 's a pity that I 've known for so long . " " How can you hurt yourself so ? " " To keep from hurting him . " " You 've hurt me. "  | " You allowed yourself to be hurt if you truly are . I told you how it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ever ? " " I want to , " she said simply , rather defiantly . " If it 's all right I 'll call you ; please do n't refuse me , though you have every right . " " I ca n't refuse you . " " I wish you could , but I 'm glad you ca n't . " " Eve .... " " I could n't tell you all this in a letter . I 'm not much of a coward . " " You look so lovely .... " " It 's good to see you , Ralph . It does n't seem so bad now that I know I can talk to you . Would you still want Henri to do your play ? " " No . " " I did n't think so .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and despair gripped him , tugged mercilessly at his intestines . He would have his phone number changed first thing the next day . " Goodbye then . " " Ralph . . . ? " " What ? " " You 've changed your mind about my calling , have n't you ? " " Yes . " " I saw it on your face . Please do n't . We are n't very corn/fortable there . We need a lot of things . It 's just the West Side .... " " What 're you talking about ? " He knew . Eve was bright that way . " All right , " she said . " I wo n't call if that 's what you want . " She turned and stepped into the street to hail a cab . He stood waiting until one came , then frightened , terribly frightened , he called , " Eve ! Yes ! Yes ! " and then he took the subway home . Patient has become sullen , defiant , evasive .... " How old were you when Juanita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember her death ? " " No , but I remember the funeral ; it was at home , like Mary Ellen 's ; it was kind of dim . Smelled funny . " " What do you mean funny ' ? " " Like  --  like  --  fish ! " With some amazement Ralph 's mind had drifted back to that somber funeral room . It was fish , and potato salad , " he said . " After that the next thing I recall is  --  the train . " He pulled his eyes from the past and looked at Dr. Bluman . " It ran right down the street in front of our house . I guess I 'd never been out before , and this day I went out and the train came down street , rumbling , its bell was ringing , the steam coming out  --  I was scared as hell . I screamed and ran up the stairs . My mother heard me and was on her way out the door . I ran right into her and she picked me up and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mashed it out . " After a while I was n't scared anymore . Next , I remember the fight . "  |p136Dr  . Bluman watched the simulated tough smile . This was the first session in weeks when he had n't had to push his patient . " I do n't know what caused it . But they were fighting and bumping into the walls ; my father was shouting and my mother screaming . She was on the floor and he was standing over her , something in his hand . I think I screamed too . I 'm not sure , not sure . . . . " Ralph looked helplessly at the doctor . " Then nothing . A big hole . Next thing I knew my mother  --  I did n't know who the hell she was then  --  was coming up the porch with this damned baby in her arms . A few days later , I knew she was my mother . After that I got all the pieces . " " What about the gap ? " " I never worried about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't remember . " " Try . " " How can I recall something I do n't remember ? " " You have to work your way through the unpleasantness . " " How do you know it was unpleasant ? " " Because you ca n't remember it . " " It could have been something very good . " " No , Mr. Joplin . " " Anyway , I do n't think it 's so goddamned important ! " " Then why do n't you say something about it ? Toss it out like you 've tossed other things out here . " Ralph sprang to his feet . " I 've had enough of this crap for today ! " He glared at Dr. Bluman and the doctor saw , for the first time , a plea  --  camouflaged as it was by anger , rage  --  in Ralph 's eyes . Dr. Bluman waved his patient with gentlep137movements of his hand , back into his chair , fascinated ( or frightened ? ) by the danger he had sensed . " Very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about it right now , but do be seated . Time is valuable and something might come of it if only you 'll sit it out . There 're a hundred others waiting for your chair  --  " Ralph shot the doctor a look , dropped his eyes and asked in a less angry voice , " Am I so bad , then , that you had to take me right away ? " Dr. Bluman frowned . His patient 's brief rage had unsettled him . " That 's not at all what I meant . " " How much time have we ? " Ralph asked . " No more . See you Wednesday . " " Yeah , sure . " Ralph went out into the raw New York winter . Patient has tried to by-pass the working out of his problems .... " We 'd been on this bit for weeks , " Ralph said , " and I got tired . I was spending all my time on the job and at home thinking about that gap and getting nowhere . So I called my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Joplin , I 've cautioned you about reading psychiatric works and certainly you should 've known that calling your parents was along the same line . These things 've got to be worked out . You have n't really helped yourself , you see . " Ralph turned to the window . " Spring is coming again , doctor . I felt it in the air today . I feel like I 've been here an awfully long time , and I want to hurry . " Why was it , Dr. Bluman wondered lazily , that the clinicp138patients were always in a hurry while the private ones lingeredon and on and on , waiting to be told that nothing more could be done for them ? " What did she tell you ? " he asked . " She said my father went away . For almost a year . Jail . She left town for over a year and came back with my sister . " Dr. Bluman watched Ralph frown . " Where were you during this time ? " Dr. Bluman suspected where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . " Ralph 's voice was incredulous . " For nearly a year . My father took me out . I might have spent  --  a lot of time there , " he said wonderingly . He got a grip on himself . " She tried to make me remember something about the place , but I could n't . I still ca n't . I guess I was pretty rough with her . " " But why ? " " I do n't know . As she was telling me I had a sense of having been betrayed . " Dr. Bluman said quietly , " Our time 's up , Mr. Joplin . " Patient dreams .... Ralph said , " I was walking around with these two girls , just ambling around . Suddenly we 're in the make-up room of a newspaper . I see a banner and it reads The New York Times . While I 'm reading it a guy comes over and says how great I am and would n't I like to work for him . I turn him down . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see ropes hanging from the ceiling . The dream sort of goes after that . " " What do you make of it , Mr. Joplin ? " Ralph shrugged . " The ropes make me think there 's a sexual connotation , but  --  " " But what ? "  | " I do n't think so . The whole dream goes back to what we 've been over many times . I do n't believe it 's sexual . I think it 's racial . " " How so ? " " In a way the girls are alike ; I think Georgia and Adela . The ropes are lynching ropes . " Ralph chuckled . " I 'd like to be offered a good job by The Times ; but that 's only a symbol . A good job , period . Then I 'd be accepted . But as it is , I 'm not . In the dream I reject the job without thinking about it twice ; I 'd like to be able to do that . " " You 've given it some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been quite some time since you 've seen Adela . " " Yes . " " When did you last see Georgia ? " " This morning . " " I mean , to sleep with her . " " This morning . " " And Sherry ? " " Last night . " " What ? " " Last night . " " Oh , " Dr. Bluman glanced at the window . " Oh , " he repeated . " I see . Did anything unusual happen ? " " What do you mean ? " " Anything that has n't happened before with either one . " " No . " " No ? " " No . " " I thought you and Sherry had broken up . "  |p142three  graves . He was glad he had n't worn a hat . He 'd have felt foolish taking it off . Beloved SonRobert Joseph JoplinCorporal , Army of the United States1930  --  1951This , the newest grave , was closest to the road ! Sissie no doubt had had it arranged that way so that Rob could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone down to the Union Station in Los Angeles to receive the lead-sealed coffin . The United States flag had been draped over the coffin and an honor guard had been in attendance . Sissie had stared at the guards ; they were alive , those white boys , and Robbie lay dead . " Goddamn them , " Sissie had said , but she had n't cried . Ralph walked to the grave , the roses in his hands . Perhaps Sissie and Big Ralph , separated for so many years , had stood here together in the rain , getting Robbie laid away , to use Sissie 's expression . What had they been thinking , each of them ? Ralph knelt before the grave . He set the roses at the head and rose quickly . Three-fifths of the family rested here , and not one of them had had a good or a full life . He knew that he must see his father , but remembered that Big Ralph worked late even on Saturdays . Football would be their only topic of conversation . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked slowly into the downtown section . He stopped for coffee . The farmers from the country were in with their broods . He moved through the rustic crowds and came to a stop before the window of a store and stood looking in just to waste time.  | " Hello . " He knew it was Jeanette even before he turned around . " Hello , baby , " he said , in a tone devoid of emotion ; he reached for her hand and kissed her cheek . It was as if they had seen each other only the day before . " Why are you smirking ? " she asked , smiling herself . He said , " I 'm not smirking . I 'm smiling because I 'm glad to see you . Surprised . " He was not . He had always expected her to appear again one of these days . Behind them the main street traffic moved slowly north and south . The street remindedRalph of those small Western towns one sights suddenlycoming around a curve . Once more she tilted her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they both knew what she meant . She was heavier now , fuller through the hips and bigger in the bust . Her skin was still pale , but hinted of deeper browns . Her eyes were stark brown against the clear whites ; folds sagged like the scabs of sores beneath them . Ralph found himself trying not to stare at her mouth . " Have you had lunch ? " he asked . " No . Is this an invitation ? " Jesus , Ralph thought . All of this was too old to have anything to do with the present . She had been a convenience in that period just after he had broken with April ; he knew that she had regarded him similarly . " Yes , let 's go eat . " " O-kay . " Nothing ever changes here , Ralph thought . Neitherthe town nor the people . " Heard you had a child . How old ? , " Ralph asked during lunch . She had been speaking about Shadows . She had heard thatp144he was living in Greenwich Village . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was already working on another play . She appeared embarrassed . Her child had been one of those " errors " he guessed . " And George ? " She shrugged her shoulders . " The same . " Surely she could not still be teaching her husband which fork to use at dinner , he thought , and by now George must be picking out his own clothes . Ralph felt a pang of pity ; George had committed the hellish sin of marrying an educated Negro woman who felt contempt for his own lack of education and sophistication . " I have to go , " Ralph said suddenly , taking her hand again . " But I 'd like to see you later . Can I ? " He waited patiently . " Where are you staying ? " she asked . " At the hotel . " " Ralph , I 'm afraid . " " It 'll be all right . " " What time ? " " Any time after nine . " " I 'll be there . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're glad . " It was like her to make that kind of joke . " Byyyyyyyyye . . . " she said . Why was he bothering to do it , he asked himself . Certainly he got no pleasure from it . But there would be a kind of satisfaction for him . Ile was no longer merely a promising young man as he had been before . He was now , in her eyes , , one of the wielders of power . He laughed.  | " McCarran , " Ralph told the receptionist at the paper . It had been Anna 's idea , this stopping by the paper , just to say hello . " Might noodge things a bit , " she 'd said after her third Martini . The receptionist said , " Go ahead in . " " Thanks . " Ralph felt her eyes upon him . None of your goddamn business what I want , he thought . He walked across the city room with its dulled marble floors . The ink from the presses downstairs was not so keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper . Back near the wall the teletypeschattered on and on , bells ringing at the end of each story . Ralph did not look in the direction of the managing editor , but could see Addison out of the corner of his eye . McCarran , florid and looking tired , waved at Ralph from across the room . As Ralph approached McCarran 's desk , the phone rang . Ralph smiled . Addison . He 'd be calling asking McCarran : " Is that Joplin out there ? " Ralph sat down in the chair beside the desk . " Yeah , " McCarran said into the phone . He studied Ralph , then let his eyes drop to the desk . He hung up . " How y'doin ' , buddy ? " McCarran held out his hand , playing the role of the tired , hardbitten reporter . " Congratulations , " McCarran said . " That was Addison on the phone . He wants a feature and a couple of pix . Okay ? " Ralph shrugged . " Sure , why not ? " Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps the Express did own a little of him for each of those nights he checked in and then back out to cover what was happening in the Pork Chop , that section of the city where the Negroes lived and clamored to get out of , and where most of the policemen on the forcep146supplemented their salaries with a graft which provided a decent living . Perhaps the Express 's ownership had been invested in that ragged little desk with its miserable light where he was allowed to work up the crime news  --  the murders and vice-squad raids ; the wife-beatings and the stabbings . Later he had risen on the staff , and had interviewed Negroes , those who were sincerely concerned with their lot in town and those who sought only for those sticks of print which gave their names and addresses . From the latter he had taken money , which had been willingly given , but he had almost never used their names  --  mostly because of the paper 's policy but also because he had not wanted to . Brotherhood Week had been different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names he wished . Since his leaving , there had been no other Negro at the Express . Now for Addison and his feature . Was it not possible that the Express had helped make Ralph a playwright ? Maybe , Ralph thought , watching McCarran clean his typewriter ( it was a fetish , done before beginning each story ) . Yes , Addison was right . McCarran slipped the sheet of paper into the typewriter . When the interview was over , Ralph , reading the rough , noticed that the Express ' style had n't changed  --  there was still the same provincial lead : " A former Express employee and native of the city today returnedin triumph , his Broadway play , Shadows on the Sun ' scheduled to open this fall . He is .... " Later , when Jeanette came whirling into Ralph 's room , she said , " I felt just like everyone in the lobby knew . " Ralph laughed and gave her a drink . As always she drank little , likep147a whore who has to be right on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did n't think of herself as a whore , but she gave away what she had with a furiousness that would have shocked any self-respecting prostitute . When they were in bed together , he was glad he 'd had a few drinks . Her body was coarse and unsymmetrical . Protoplasm . When she kissed him ( moaning with the theatrics of a Fourteenth Street pickup ) he thought of a series of small , feverishly wet gulpings . Her mouth gaped and strained for his tongue . Yes , she was flabby now . She was moving in his arms in a rhythm all her own , twitching , her hands all over him . Ralph felt almost as if he were a spectator . He began to move slowly , surely , forcing her from one position to another . Once he opened his eyes and saw that she was watching him . He should n't have asked her , he knew . His body grew rigid ; he was conscious of how strong she was . He let her go . Gone now was her caution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . With a moan which was this time genuine she tore her mouth from his , scattering small splashes of saliva over their bodies ; her lips and tongue searched his neck , fastened like wild leeches upon his chest ; then they glided down over the curves of his stomach , lingering but a second on his navel . He felt a crazy desire to shout something like " Go , baby ! " But he waited until she was where she wanted to be , then forced her head up and turned her struggling upon her back . Her body was stiff with anger , gun-hard . But he held her . It was as it had always been with her : penetration minimum . She clawed and quivered , he strained brutally to widen the breach , and then hesitated , knowing the strugglep148would not end until she had her way . She rose to her knees , strong and trembling  --  all he saw was the nape of her neck . There was not the smallest part of love inherent in the act ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had transformed her into a man . Ralph forced her from him ; " Do n't , " she whined . " Stop it , Ralph ! " Her spine tensed . " Goddamn you ! " He covered her mouth with his hand . He was turning her over . A pillow fell to the floor . She dug her feet into the bed and arched her back . Ralph let his body fall upon her . " Ralph ! No ! I never  --  ! " She did n't stop fighting . He wrapped his arms around her and held on . She tried to bite him . Her eyes had grown large and she shook her head as if in disbelief . Jeanette rose in one great final effort to dislodge him . When finally she was no longer her peculiar kind of a virgin , Ralph stumbled to the shower . When he came out she was gone . He felt lonely . Ralph lit a cigarette and walked to the window , and stared at the barren street below . He remembered sitting with his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stadium ; the hill where all the people without money came to watch the games . They sat on the hill and it was cold . Great cheers burst from the bowl below and a lone figure , clad in orange and blue , raced out of the eastern end of the stadium into view , speeding across the green , white-striped field . His father jumped to his feet , bellowing " Go on , Hudson , go ! " The hill behind them rocked with shouts . " Touchdown ! " his father cried , lifting Ralph on his shoulder . Below , a cannon sounded : Thoomp ! No alumnus had been more faithful to the Hill than his father . Impetuously Ralph walked to the phone . He was lucky enough to catch one of the last flights to New York.  |p149The  sessions with Dr. Bluman were becoming time-consuming , wasteful , it seemed to Ralph . Jeanette had been , Ralph said , like  --  and then he had stopped because he had thought of Doughnut . " Like who ? " Dr. Bluman had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shield behind which his patient sat . But Ralph had avoided giving an answer and the session had gone on , others following . He could not talk about Eve . First , because initially he could not , and second because now , jostling around within the area of free association , he felt slyer , superior , because there was something which he after all could retain of his own . Bluman insisted upon a return of self-examination , to a perusal of personality . Ralph , on the other hand , insisted that personality be ex-ploredin terms of environment . Then , three nights running , he dreamed of Doughnut , and sometimes Doughnut had the face of Jeanette . Patient 's hostility has returned .... " I dreamed I killed you , Dr. Bluman . " Dr. Bluman flicked his note . " Yes ? " " I just killed you . " " I think the reaction is normal after our last few sessions . " Ralph looked closely at the doctor and for the smallest part of a second wondered if he should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was glad when that second had passed that he had not . " But tell me , how ? " Ralph looked blankly at him . " In a fight ? Gun ? " Dr. Bluman had thought , Knife ? but changed his mind . " None of those . "  | " How then ? " " I 'll tell you about the dream . I 'm angry with you ; you 've done something horrible to me  --  " " What ? " " Well  --  " Dr. Bluman waited . " You hurt me . " Dr. Bluman waited again , puzzled by a feeling of being aware of some vague inconsistency . " How did I hurt you ? " The patient 's eyes came up , cleanly , innocently , but somehowmasked over . " Sodomy , " Ralph said . " I see . Then what happened ? " " I decide to kill you . I have a hatred I 've seldom had inmy life . I wait for you . It 's night . I push you off a cliff . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock . " Acliff , you say ? " " Yes . " " Where 's the cliff ? Have you been around any lately ? " " I do n't know . " " New Jersey ? " " Do n't know . " " Try . " " I am . " " Upstate a little ways ? There are n't any cliffs around here . " " I do n't know ! " Dr. Bluman 's voice came a bit harsher , more insistent . " This seems somewhat unusual , Mr. Joplin . Let 's get to the bottom of it . Have you ever been involved with another man ? " " No . " " Never ? "  | " No . " " Not as a child ? " " No . " " Wanted to ? " " No ! " " All right , all right , all right ! Now the cliff : ' Were there cars near ? What was I wearing ? Why did n't you shoot me  --  " Ralph broke in . " There were trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing the thing ? Have I goofed ? " Tall trees , and it 's hot . Tall trees , " he said again , " you know p  --  " Dr. Bluman slid forward . " What ? " " Pear trees . " " Pear trees . " " Yes , " Ralph said hopefully . " But pear trees are n't tall . Not in the sense that  --  " " I 'm sure they were pear trees , " Ralph said quickly . " Why are you so sure ? " Even more rapidly , eager to pacify , Ralph said , " Because some of the coconuts are on the ground ! " Ralph set his face sincerely toward the doctor . He saw a light go on in Bluman 's eyes and Ralph speedily re-thought his last words , selected coconut as the impetus for that knowing light . " Co-co-nuts , Mr Joplin ? " Ralph felt an urgency to yawn and he stretched his mouth , then reached for a cigarette and lighted it . " We were in the tropics , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I just do n't know , doc . " " Doc " echoed in his mind . " You were in the tropics during the war , were n't you ? " " Yes , " Ralph said.  |p152Dr  . Bluman looked again at the clock . " Time 's almost up , " he said and Ralph knew by his manner that Bluman wished it were n't . " I must tell you , Mr. Joplin , that the pattern of your dreams , with the exception of perhaps two , has never been specific . There is something so specific about this one that it makes me think that it is no dream at all . You 're hiding something . What , I have no idea  --  " Dr. Bluman stopped and looked at Ralph , thinking , Is it possible ? Patient missed two successive sessions . Patient appears calm , more sure of himself than at any other time ... . " We 've been making it in circles . You say it 's me ; I say it 's it . You talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , as a white therapist . I 'm talking about mine ; mine as a black man and we are not talking about the same reality . " Dr. Bluman studied his patient 's hairline . " There are things I 've gotten here on myself , but they 've all been things I 've suspected or put together anyway , and they all go back to the it you 've been telling me to adjust to , to accept . And I ca n't do it ; I ca n't make that scene . " Dr. Bluman thought about his patient 's last phrase and in context understood what it meant . Ralph went on . " At every bend in the road there 's been it , for me , for my family , all the way down the line , like weather affects birds , as currents of warm or cold water affect fish . Do you think my parents would have been at one another 's throats if there 'd been room for my father to behave even nominally like a man ; do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife bring home the bacon ? And further , would my mother have been my mother if they hadp153allowed my grandfather to live his life a man instead of a black man down there in Mississippi . The last recession  --  why are ninety percent of the men out of work nonwhite ? You ask me to adjust to these conditions ? The things which constituteyour reality are nothing more than a psychic concentration camp for me . I guess what I expected here was someone neutral to spill my guts to so no one would know how much it all bugs me . " Ralph halted , filled abruptly with the sadness of still another disappointment . " Well , I want to give this chair to someone who can put it to better use ; someone who has a problem that can be solved in a lifetime . " He waited ; he had announced his intention to leave therapy . " You 've derived some benefit because you 're Negro , Mr .. Joplin . " It made Dr. Bluman fretful to have a patient leave before he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too often the result of guilt , are the very things that made me know times should be better , doctor . " The patient was using the term " doctor " rather patronizingly , Dr. Bluman thought . " Many Negroes have n't had or will never have your opportunities . " " Can you begin to imagine how much worse it 's got to be for them ? " " Tell me , Mr. Joplin , when you say it , ' what do you mean ? " Ralph thought , He 's being patronizing with his " Mister Joplin . " " Racial discrimination . When I first came here , I must have sounded like the Negro child who 's spent his first year finding out what it 's all about and blamed all his problems on it . But I looked at it , doctor , and it is so . Two things happen when you 're able to see and say I 'm what I am because of racial discrimination . First , when you reach this.  |p154conclusion  , which seems to me inevitable , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't applicable to you . Then you begin killing yourself in a hundred little ways . Or , havingreached the end of that road , you start back , not really knowing what the hell you 're going to do , but at least and at last unhampered by delusion . But there 's life in understanding finally where you 're at . " " When did you first begin to reach this conclusion ? During the war , in the tropics ? " There was something besides coldnessin the doctor 's eyes . " Yes , " Ralph said . He turned his gaze to the print on the wall . Dr. Bluman blew out a puff of air . " You are leaving therapy then ? " " Yes . " " How do you feel about it ? Leaving , I mean . " " I 'm sad because the clinic does n't have what I need . " " You 've some loose ends , you know . " " I 'll work them out . " Dr. Bluman stood . He picked up the clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The time 's all gone , " he said . Now Ralph stood . " It is ? " Dr. Bluman went to the door , held it open for Ralph . " Good luck , Mr. Joplin . " " Goodbye , doctor . Thank you . " RIVERSIDE CLINICTo : Dr. Morris Alpert New York , June 18 , 1959FROM : Dr. Sidney Bluman PATIENT : Joplin , Ralph , Jr . Patient began therapy Nov. 3 , 1957 . Psychometric tests indicatedhigh average intelligence , but with reduced intellectual efficiency ; also evidence of paranoid thinking , grave anxietiesP155and a hostile and evasive personality . Diagnosis : **29;4374;TOOLONG . Patient has no previous history ; however , he states that he feigned mental disturbance in order to get discharged while overseas . He further states that the attending physician accusedhim of being ashamed because of his race and then excusedhim . Age given : 34 . Occupation : Office worker  --  Playwright . Patient has had a normal sexual life which began at age ten . Masturbation , infrequent prior to his marriage , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was terminated by divorce five years ago . There was one child born of this union , a girl . Cause for the divorce , according to patient , was wife 's infidelity . Patient stated that he was beginning therapy because he " was at the end of his rope but only in his mid-thirties . " He described this as being unable to obtain suitable employment , difficulties in obtaining housing , although he feels he is qualifiedfor a number of positions because of his education and experience . He characterizes the housing situation as being " impossible . " Patient blamed these conditions on his race ; he is Negro . Patient can be described as dark brown , tall , with a mustache and well-defined features . His demeanor is cautious and reserved . He appears unconcerned by what is going on around him , though he is implicitly aware of the events . He does not encourage friendliness . Patient is well-spoken and has charm . His anger is expressed by an aloof silence or by an unreasonable burst of rage . He has expressed some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the eldest of two living siblings , born to parents who later separated . Two siblings died in infancy . A brother was killed in the Korean War . Patient 's problems probably con/gealed at preschool age when father was incarcerated for the attempted murder of patient 's mother . The cause for the attemptis believed to have been infidelity . The mother placed patient in a public home and left the city . Both parents were absent for about a year , and after , a reconciliation which lasted some nine years took place . The mother dominated the home . In defense of the father , patient said , Negro women could always get domestic work where a man could not . Sessionsindicated a high rejection probability as regards patient 1 ) because he was the eldest and the youngest required more care , and 2 ) because of the economic situation which patient has described in detail . Of the two siblings who later died , one was able to create affection in the patient who was entering adolescence . He later transferred this affection to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection from the mother when the father left the household . Patient relates adolescent desire to assume the father 's role , but denies this desire included sexual relations with the mother . The acceptable part of this affection rejected , patient turned to hatred of the mother , but therapy indicates that by early manhood the balance was achieved . However , his relationship with Mrs. S. , a neighbor some twenty years his senior , may be a subconscious fulfillment of the adolescent desire . Beginning sessions indicated a serious impairment of patient 's affectivity potential , but throughout therapy his attachment ( in a sense , neurotic ) for another female , S. , might indicate a desire to remove this obstacle . There is doubt that his marriage had any effect on this barrier . Returning to Mrs. S. , patient 's relationship with her might also indicate a working out of this problem . The affair with Mrs. S. is apparently without the Dollardmotivations . Mrs. S. is Caucasian . There are , nonetheless , overtones of Oedipal origin . Patient is aware of the futurelessnessof this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a female nearer his own age ) has more depth . Patient himself drew comparisons between S. and his mother . She dominates because of her money . While this might be a minor factor , it is always with patient . Patient is in competition with sister , a singer whom he visited abroad . She has had a highly successful career , which underlineshis failures , according to him . Patient also expressed some distress at the success of a writer friend . However , his corn-bativenessis within bounds , his envy within reason . Throughout therapy patient has exhibited masochistic tendencieswhich do not run counter to diagnosis . He denies having a compulsion to hurt , just as he denies aggression which often has carried him into combative situations . His aspirations were high compared to what he could gain before the acceptance of a play . This factor has given him new self-esteem which in turn may remove the frustrations which have caused his anger . The other traits of low self-esteem , self-renunciation , cautiousness , ingratiatory behavior might also be removed . The removals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from retaliatory measures . Before the acceptance of his play for production , there had been either a marked lack of self-esteem or a void altogether ; at present a redemption is taking place . During the last of the current sessions , patient threatened therapist through the medium of a " dream . " Prior to this , patientand therapist had been engaged in crucial talks involving his parents . Patient became visibly angry . At the next session patient disclosed his " dream . " Details noted by patient were unrelated to " dream " as most details are . The " dream " incident which angered him to the point where he wished to kill therathatof a homosexual rape , indicates that patient has ignoredadmonition to avoid reading psychiatric material . The incident t might be interpreted as a beating , or in patient 's aggressive syntax , loss of manhood by virtue of the beating . " Dream " has the iVp158mark of a recurrent nightmare , one which had origins in adult life ; details mature . It is likely that the basis for this nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes it took place in the tropics during the war . Therapist attached significance to this disclosure because the patient missed the next two sessions and left therapy after the third , although therapist felt work remained to be done . Conclusion : Patient 's progress was immensely helped by acceptance of his work . The rationale that his problems stem directly from his racial origins may have some validity ; patient claimed no adjustment to an inferior status could be made when therapist suggested an acceptance of the reality of the situation . Patient states that he and therapist were at an impasse and that while he has learned something of himself , his great problem remained and could only be alleviated by the removal of the outside pressure which brought him to us . Dr. Bluman pecked out a note to his superior and attached the summary . His note read : Morris : Is there really anything to Tappan 's pilot study on the effect of discrimination upon Negroes ? Let me know . Many thanks , SidP.S . How about that new dictaphone ? This one 's goingfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's postanalyticaldepression that Eve decided to leave Henri . Shadows on the Sun had opened and was a success ; the play settled down for a long run after shifting theatres a couple of times . Eve did not make her decision until she was given an ultimatum by Ralph : she would have to leave Henri or not see him at all . They had been to another of those parties . Eve had arrived with her husband , but , as usual , had met Ralph afterward . Once they had left parties boldly , together . And there had been occasions when even Henri , drunkenly sarcastic , had asked Ralph to see Eve home . Eve had said that somehow the play had given Henri everything he now needed . She hadp160asked Henri to release her but he had refused and she was reluctant to leave him . Ralph had had a lot to drink at the party , but Eve had drunk little . He spoke very quietly , so quietly that his voice trembled , and then went to bed . She put on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom and , jostling Ralph gently , told him all right , she would leave Henri . Afterward , with a little sigh and a languid turning in his arms , she went to sleep . Ralph continued to lie awake . The gray of a morning come too soon sat heavily within the room . The air conditioners which had battled the humid night continued their monotonous racket , tiny motors churningfuriously . A great truck , lost , for the street below Ralph 's apartment was not a truck route , bawled hoarsely with its air horn , hissed its air brakes and in a few seconds was gone . And then a stray , hungry pigeon galloped past the window , returned and fluttered down to the sill . It cooed ; Ralph could see its throat puffing , its iridescent feather tips dull in the gray light . After a moment it flew away again . So it was a new day , he thought . It was an important day , perhaps the most important in his life . Then he promptly thought of a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he considered , they might have all existed only to bring him to this morning . Which were the important days ? The day Anna called with the news of his play ? No , he thought . You expected that day ; you moved inescapably toward it , even if it never came . The day Raffy was born ? Ah , that had been a dazzling , mystical , irrational moment . P161The day Doughnut thrust himself into his life or the day he ended Doughnut 's ? Yes , the first was important ; it was as if he had been wound up then and had started ticking . And he thought of the day when the Japanese officer on Peleliu had shouted to that pitiable little group of reluctant Negro Seabees , cargo humpers for the Marines , " What are you doing here ? Why do you fight with them ? " One of the men in the hole had fired his carbine screaming , " Shut up you yellow Jap bastard ! " It made Ralph sad to think of that day . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with the broom . He had been only fourteen then and had taken the broom away from her ; they had stood looking at each other and finally she had cried . That day Ralph had known that he was a man . All of those days had brought him to this one . Staring at Eve , he wondered at the forces which coupled people . " What 're you thinking ? " Eve asked , her eyes opening . About us ? " " Yes . " She said , " Do n't be afraid . " He said , " I 'm not afraid . " " I 'm not either . " " Are n't you ? You have my life and you 're not afraid ? " " No . Are you afraid to have mine ? " " No . " After he had paused he said , " How could it take me until nearly forty to know that to be loved is a responsibility and you until only twenty-five ? " " I do n't know . And you 're not nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " This will be a kindness to all of us . I wish I had n't met you , though . I could have been cruel all Henri 's life and he 'd never have known . " At noon , showered and dressed , silent over her coffee , his hand pressed tightly to her lap , she ignored his unblinking worried stare and said , " You should n't have dressed . There 'll be no trouble . " " I hate you when you 're so sure of yourself . " " Love me . " " I wish there was n't this to do . But "  --  he gestured hopelesslywith his hands  --  " do it . Do it . " " Yes , I know . I will . " " More coffee ? " He held the pot poised over her cup , waiting . " No . " She pushed her cup away . " Am I what you want , really ? " " Yes , " he said . " Yes , but do n't make me kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were done with games . " No , I just wanted you to say it again . " " Words , " he scoffed , " mean nothing today . They 're empty . If you do n't know by now that I love you , words are n't going to help . " He sat alone drinking coffee , meditating upon his new , tranquil condition : contentment . He did not deserve happiness . Doughnut , he thought . How the family would applaud if they knew ! What glee ! Served the bastard right ! But violencewas basic ; it was always there , expected , met , bested if possible . The family had understood the nature of violence even as they were being shipped from West Africa aboard ,  |p163|perha|ps  , the Desire , 120 tons , out of Rhode Island with its stink of slopping feces , urine , vomit , rotting bodies and stale blood . Perhaps that was where it began , that need which had become a lowering , concealed lust for revenge . Retribution for Doughnut ? No , Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come crashing through the door to charge him with murder . Retribution coming maybe for April , of April . He rose from the table and moved to his desk . He reached for paper . The typewriter was dusty ; he walked across the room , secured a cloth , brush and cleaning fluid . April  --  and Raffy , of course . The hospital : he 'd worked there as a night orderly , often handling the corpses , shaving them , setting them into their refrigerated compartments . April had n't touched him for months after she found out ; death not only frightened but disgusted her . The foundry : he had driven his body against sand , steel , and time , moving with the perfect rhythm of the craftsman . Then there was the end of school , and the foundry , and the resumption on another level of his work on the paper . And Raphaella had been born , planned of course . That was the way to do things : with a casual diligence . He was by then , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than working every day , and not being publicly drunk , being seen occasionally with his daughter and appearing at church from time to time . " Ambition " in that town was the barricade that blocked access to a vaster world . Ralph looked up from the typewriter and wished EveP164would call to tell him that everything was all right , that Henri had accepted her decision . Once more , he looked down and resumed cleaning the typewriter . He had not known just when he 'd had enough of the Express ; nor when buying a cheap house on a G.I. loan and paying off a Chevrolet became meaningless to him . He knew , however , that he could n't say to April : I want out , it 's no good . It 's a mistake . April the Fundamentalist would have quickly suggested analysis . So he said nothing . Instead , little by little he began withholding . Little things first : now she had to drive herself to church , he did n't go at all , he stayed at the Express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was in monosyllables . There was another woman , April said . No , he answered . What then ? Nothing . I do n't know , he said , lying . Two months , three , five passed . He saw the resentment growing within her . April 's revenge was swift , simple and predictable . Ralph knew that what women carried between their legs was no particular prize . The models came like that , every one . He knew that he should have felt no emotion the night he came home early from the Express and stood outside his bedroom listening . After a moment he flicked on the light . The stranger scurried out of bed and clutched for his clothes . April just stared defiantly . " Get out , motherfucker , " Ralph said , " or you 're dead . " The stranger , clothes in hand , scuttled into the hall and out of the house . April lit a cigarette . She moaned hoarsely , " I 'm human , I 'm human , goddamn you ! " Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for her , without emotion . On the floor , damp and wrinkled , was the condom . All right . Expected : retribution for April.  |p165It  was dark out now . Ralph had n't realized it was so late . Why had n't Eve called ? Maybe Henri had punched Eve in the nose . The Fates : giving and taking back . " I 'm all right , " Eve said when she finally did call . " I 'm at Barbara 's . Do n't ask me to come over . I want to be by myself for a while . " " You 're all right , " he said . " Yes , but I did n't tell you that I loved you . " " I know already . Have you ever felt when you spoke of love to me that you 'd seen too many movies and plays and read too many stories that you 're acting out ? All of them handled with a language that seems inadequate ? " " Yes . " " Me too . I wish we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure it made more sense . You had to use the exact combination of grunts and things . I suppose once it was even hard to lie . Anyway  --  " He took a deep breath . " G'night . " He rose and dressed for a walk . Outside the sky seemed to be filling with stars , as many as one could see in the garishly lighted city . The great jets , outspeeding their own sounds , slithered and rustled through the night . Would the missiles , all those missiles hidden in all those secret , well-manned and well-guarded places come with a jet sound or would they come nosing heavily over in silence , solemnly dipping their noses and end it ? An end to it . Fantastic , incomprehensible that it should be so visible , the end , so pressingly present , neatly defining the denouement of the comedy . A flock of geese sharp on a radarscope ; a Negro SAC navigator smarting under racial rebuff in Grand Forks , North Dakota , and seeking the ultimatesubsconscious revenge ; a radio out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a sane one ; a locked switch ; a distortion of codes ; a hot-tempered President  --  and bang ! And yet this  --  not quite an inevitability  --  was accepted universallyas such . But then man had always fled from the great stalking animals and had hidden himself until the danger had passed , confident that it would be of its own accord . Sometimesman had to stand and fight because he was trapped ; but the awareness of being trapped seemed to have been bred out of him . Ralph 's stride quickened with anger . Was this what the Fates had in store for him , for all the Joplins who had not died in the slave raids nor during the Middle Passage which had taken fifteen millions ? Was this scorching and sundering of the earth to be their welcome when they joined those other survivors , not necessarily the fittest ? Shit . Tttt ! He wished he were able to get to those ugly gnomes who inhabitedthe secret control rooms of the world and horsewhip sense into them , the way Sissie had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , directing the sounds with teeth , tongue , palate or lips no longer seemed the truthful or reliable way to communicate ; one found oneself speaking other people'slies and half-truths automatically . Yes , horsewhip the gnomes ; horsewhip the crap out of them . There then would be your goddamned deterrent . Or one could eliminate the gnomes the way some peoples eliminated the workers of black magic and people over sixty or people who ate more than their share of kangaroo shit . And not only the gnomes in the attic , no sir ! The cellars would have to be cleaned out as well ; all those sneaky little bastards who felt without a doubtp167that they possessed as much power as history told them they had , but who had it only by the grace of letting others use it , would have to go . Perhaps sooner than the gnomes . No , at the same damned time . What was needed was an authority such as was never seen upon the earth . One that killed , but killed not with hatred or laughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an authority kind of insanely holy ; a Christ in the temple , not with a whip but with one of those short , wide-bladed Roman swords . Had He stopped them for good in the temple he might not have had to cryon that Friday , " Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? " Perhaps He had been unable to kill out of love . He had slowed and was on the way home again . Months before , he had not felt the anger ; he had not had much to lose , not even Shadows . It was as if just that day he had realized an utterly wonderful kind of happiness which had finally come to him was being threatened by things he could not control . He was puzzled as well as angry , for he had once felt that he controlled his own life ; he had had to . But by pressing open finger after finger of that tightly closed fist , year after year , the Fates had removed his grip upon himself ; they had done it snugly , tauntingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the denouement he would lie in his bed unmoving , with , if he were lucky , a woman just as fatalistic as himself . But now , God ! if they gave him five minutes warning , three even , he 'd find some way to get Eve and himself out of there . Everything , suddenly , seemed to matter . He wanted to be as happy with Eve as he was capableand to hell with IT and with THEM . In other words , Jack he thought as he entered his building , fuck it , Jack , and forward with the Joplins !  |p168Yes  , there had been an unbelievable feel of happiness , one that he accepted suspiciously . He looked out of the window . Clear . Absolutely clear . It 'd be as cold as a witch 's tit in the morning , early in the morning when they started to the airport . This , then , is what the Fates would have : Sissie . Ralph fixed himself a drink . Where did the feeling come from , the feeling that everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought , those goddamn Methodists do a job on a cat . Oh , wow ! His mordant , humorous thought did not do away with the situation ; it remained , and he was glad when he heard them , Eve and Iris , in the hallway , their voices slightly muffled ; it was something carpeted hallways always did to people  --  made them speak softer , as if in a church . " It 's stopped snowing , baby ! " Eve said , rushing through the door , her eyes bright with the cold , her cheeks tinted a little darker , her lips sculptured and cold , but warming instantlywhen she touched them to his . " We brought champagne ! " Iris said , kicking the door closed behind her and Eve . " I loved it , Broth , I loved it ! " She hoisted the magnum in one hand . " Bravo ! " She threw off her coat , breathless . " I wanted to shout Bravo ! ' but Eve would n't let me . " She let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cold already  --  " " What 's the matter ? " Eve asked , noticing Ralph 's rather studied smile and a distant sadness . Iris approached him . " Bro ? What is it ? " Eve paused in the process of taking off her coat . " Nothing , " he said . " The reservations are set for eight inp169the morning . It 's the first flight out . We should be there by noon . " " Oh , " Iris said , " but no news . " " No . " " I want to talk to Dad before I go to bed . " " Okay . " Ralph rose and went to the phone . Iris followed.  |p170BIG  RALPH JOPLIN shifted from one huge buttock to the other , opened his eyes and stared at the television screen . A cowboy movie ; no , it was the telephone . He stared at the instrument . Wearily he pushed aside the small table which contained the remnants of his television dinner . He looked at the clock . It was past his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched stiffly , picked up the tray , took it to the kitchen and dumped it into the garbage pail . He walked heavily down the creaking cellar stairs to check the furnace . Cold tonight , he thought . Stoke it up good . Once down there , moving in the shadows , he decided that he would callP171his brother Lewis . The phone call might have been from him . Might be sick or something . Big Ralph took a long swig of beer and placed the can beside the phone . He paused a moment before dialing to watch the movie . " Lewis , " he said , when he heard his brother 's voice . " You call me ? " Lewis had n't . " I thought maybe somethin ' had come up so we could n't watch the fight tomorrow . Well , I 'm sorry . How inna hell was I supposed to know you was sleepin ' ? " Big Ralph hung up and turned back to the cowboy movie . He sipped his beer . The phone rang again . Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Dad , it 's me  --  Iris . " " Iris ? Iris ! " Beer spurted from the holes Big Ralph had punctured in the container . " Where arc you calling from ? Europe ? What 's wrong ? " " I 'm at Ralph 's , Daddy , in New York . how are you ? " " Oh , pretty good for an old man . Why did n't you write more often ? " He laughed nervously . " You did n't write at all . " " Well , I 'm the old man . " " Ralph will talk to you in a moment . " " That rascal . Comes here to see his little girl and never stops by to see me . I hear about it three , four days after-wards . " Iris laughed politely . " You married again , Iris ? Got kids ? " " No , no , I 'm not married . "   " You ought to , Iris , and you ought to come back to America . Europe , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused a moment . " Daddy , Mother 's very ill . " " Sissie 's sick ? What 's the matter ? " Big Ralph took a double swallow of beer . " Heart . Dad , it 's pretty bad , but we 're hoping and pray-ing . " " I hope she 'll be all right , " Big Ralph said . " We hope so too . " " I 'd love to see you when you get back . If you feel up to it . " " Of course , Daddy . Like to talk to Ralph now ? " " Yeah , yeah , lemme talk to of Ralph . " After he had finished talking to his son , Big Ralph sat down and watched the cowboy movie again . He imagined himself calling Lewis and saying , " Lewis , Sissie 's dyin ' . " Lewis was sure to answer : " When people get old they die . "  |p175THE  PAIN WAS NOT WHAT IT HAD BEEN . Sissie wondered what time it was . Why had n't Ralph and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The years had slipped by so quickly . Ten or twenty times during each of those rushing years she had thought of writing her daughter and telling her , but each time Sissie had decided that Iris would be coming home soon and they could talk then . Sissie had always felt that her daughter should know . She had come to this conclusion time and time again after first considering that the girl might be better off not knowing . But not knowing was a lie and Sissie had long since stopped lying . It was lying that had got her into trouble . Sissie almost chuckled , remembering Arthur . Now Arthur reminded her of a very pretty dog , a maleP176dog , that you see loose on the streets , running up to the bitches , teeth showing in a doglike grin , neck erect , tongue lolling . He had been like a favorite hound loping into her life and out of it , returning again and again , forever sure of himself , so sure that he had made her make the mistake of thinking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of liking too , a great deal of it . How to make Iris see that ? How many times had the scene been set in her mind ? Set so often that it seemed to have taken place already . " Did you see April ? " Sissie had planned to begin . Oliver would have gone out somewhere . Iris and she would be alone . " How is April ? You know I was always sorry that marriage did n't work ; sorry about yours too . What 's wrong with my children ? Was it the way I raised you all ? Honey , you know , I left home when I was a mere child . I was frightened on that train , coming all that way by myself . I met Arthur on the train ; he was a waiter , and he was kind to me , and I liked him . " The long dingy train had had the Jim Crow car fastened to the coal tender . Coal dust had swirled continuously through the car ; bags , old papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corners . The once plush-covered seats had been filthy . It had been stifling , inhumanly hot , but Arthur had come through with sandwiches and coffee and cold water for the old people . She had liked Arthur from the very first . At Cincinnati he had said , " When the train clears the station , you can sit anywhere you want , young lady , " though he was n't much older than she , " and even go to the diner and get yourself some good hot food . " He was in college , he told her , sitting down beside her after they left Buffalo ; he was working for the summer . The city she wasp177going to , he said , was one of the more progressive ones in the north ; it had a tradition , had been one of the main stations along the Underground Railroad . While he spoke , she thought how smart he was , and how much smarter he would be when he finished college . He was from North Carolina . He sometimes stayed two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had had time off . ) " I got to be pretty crazy about him , " she had planned to say to Iris . " And how that man could kiss ! You know how it is when you 're young and . . . Arthur went away and Big Ralph started to come around . Oh , you know your father . He was a singin ' man and kinda big in that raggedy town . Here I was a little of country girl with Arthur gone . Big Ralph promised me the moon , and I believed him  --  tell you I was young ! Well , that moon was so far away , girl , and one thing and another . Arthur was back the next summer , coming and going . Me and your father had been done married and had lost Juanita . Your brother ? Ralph ? Did n't nothin ' ever happen to him ! Iris , that whole town was poor . We went hungry plenty of times . Juanita started to die when we did n't have money to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I just got mad . Used to sit home all the time when I was sick ; I was sick a lot with all them babies , and if I was n't sick , I was out there workin ' because we had to get some money into that house someway . Me and Little Ralph sittin ' home , sick . Girl , I was ma-a-a-d . The only times I was n't mad were when Arthur was around . I could n't be mad when he was around . " Would Iris smile and understand ? " Yes , I slipped out to see him . I 'm talkin ' woman to woman now . I know you have n't been no virgin since you and Harry broke up , have you ? " Here she had planned to reach over andp178touch her daughter 's knee , to give it a conspiratorial push . " I know you understand , do n't you , honey ? I 'm not proud . No , I 'm not , and I got to make peace with my God . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Arthur . I 'd generally get home before Big Ralph got home from the Silver Dollar . " ( Arthur . He had not been as dandyish as Ralph . But he had been more certain of himself . And when he had kissed her , he had placed his tongue in her mouth . That had been exciting . Ralph had never done that until , one afternoon , she had kissed him that way . Arthur had come and gone , always talking about college in the fall . She knew that he would wind up with one of those high-yella girls anyway , a teacher like himself . What did he want with a country girl ? ) " Hurry ! " she heard someone say . A nurse wrapped somethingaround her left arm and pulled it so tight that it almost hurt . Sissie heard a noise , phiss , phiss , phiss , and her arm felt like it was swelling . She heard Dr. Clayton 's voice . A sharp , white light bored directly down from above . Sissie wanted to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the sun in spring . It had been in the spring that she had come to the conclusion that she was again pregnant . She must have seemed very abstracted . Arthur was always saying , " A penny for your thoughts . " Big Ralph kept eying her with a cold watchfulness . But neither of the men had known the truth about her situation . She had come close to telling Arthur but something had held her back , perhaps fear that she would be unable to trap him . Arthur 's plans for the future were so definite . Her idea had been to say that it was his child . She would never have told him it was Ralph 's . Arthur said shep179was unfaithful to him whenever she was pregnant , even though he knew she was married and sleeping in the same bed as her husband . She had to keep lying to Arthur and saying that she only did it when Big Ralph made her . One summer night she stealthily entered the house and reached for the light cord . Suddenly she stiffened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed , driving her across the room and slamming her into the wall . She collapsedonto the couch , still holding her hands in front of her and kicking furiously . The light went on and Big Ralph stood towering above her . At first Sissie wanted to scream out about the baby but her lips remained doggedly closed . She lowered her hands and caught sight of the knife . " Oh , God , no , " she said softly . She started to scramble to her feet , but Big Ralph thrust his body between her and the door . She noticed that she had a run in her stocking . " Out with him again , " he said . Sissic 's eyes widened . Big Ralph knew . " I 'll kill you , " he said matter-of-factly . He moved closer and looked down at her with disgust . " You gypsy bitch ! " Sissie collapsed into a fit of trembling . ( Tell him about the baby ! The baby ! Tell him ! ) The words would n't come out ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to think of something to say but could n't . She sought to escape but each time he interposed his body . " Oh , God , oh , God , " she mumbled now . She tasted blood in her mouth and opened her lips to let it drip on her dress , hoping that the sight of blood would bring him to his senses . He looked at her coldly . Sissie darted forward , brushed past him , seized a chair and flung it at him . It hit him and fell to the floor . Sissie stood , her back to the wall , near Little Ralph 's bedroom . She breathed heavily and stared at thep180knife , a bread knife , the lower edge of the blade sweeping up to a point . Big Ralph held it low and stepped toward her . She kicked one of her shoes at him ; he merely moved his head to one side the way she had seen him slip punches when he was boxing with his friends . She took a deep breath and shouted : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His left hand was now around her neck ; she could n't move . He forced her back against the wall and then pushed her down . Then he pulled her toward him and slammed her against the wall so that the wall shook and the dishes in the kitchen rattled . She tried to shake her head . The hand forced her chin up . She wanted to say , Please , no , but her throat seemed like clay in his hand . Then she was looking straight up at the ceiling , unable to move , waiting for the knife . Footsteps pounded up the stairs . A man 's voice : " Ralph , Big Ralph , do n't kill her ! Open this goddamned door , Ralph . Do n't be no fool now . " " Big Ralph ! " a woman 's voice shouted between the furious knocks , " you let that girl alone , you hear me ! Big Ralph ! " " Open the door ! " the man shouted again . " Sissie ? " The woman . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fainter to Sissie ; she felt the knife blade slip cleanly into her throat , halt gratingly upon the cartilage of the windpipe . A stream of hot liquid flowed along her neck and then she fainted . Big Ralph , a ghostly blur now , stepped away . Sissie slumped forward . Little Ralph , in his sleepers , his shoulders hunched high on either side of his hysterically shaking head , screamed and trembled against the wall . Bertha Weinstein , the police , the ambulance people and thep181neighbors were gathered around when Sissie came to . Her friend Cora Boatwright held Little Ralph , talked soothingly to him . Bertha Weinstein said , " He could have killed you , Sissie . As soon as Cora called I came . You 're going to be all right . Get rid of him ; put him away , " Bertha said fiercely . " And do n't worry about anything . " She turned to the officer . " She wants to file charges . " " For what ? " one of the cops asked with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , come on , lady . They have cuttings down here every night . Does she work for you ? " " Yes . " " I want to swear out a warrant , " Sissie said , looking around . " Where is he ? " The impassive faces of the neighbors stared back . " Gone , " one said . Another said , " Done gone . " " Long gone , " another said , chuckling . " I 'll go with you to the station , " Mrs. Weinstein said . " We 'll place charges all right . " The cop shrugged . " It 's up to you , lady . " He went back outside . The doctor said , " Turned out to be just a scratch ; not very deep . More blood than damage . Probably did n't want to do it anyway ; he could have . Keep that bandage on your throat about a week , then rub vaseline over it . " He picked up his bag , closed it with a professional snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car drove off . Sissie touched her throat . " He tried to kill me , " she said unbelievingly . " He tried to cut my throat . " She looked around at the neighbors . They think I deserved it , Sissie thought . " Help me up . We 'll go downtown right now . "  | " You ought to get some rest first , Sissie , " Mrs. Weinstein said . " I want to do it now ; I do n't want that shiftless man to get away . " The neighbors remained silent , not looking at her when she passed with Mrs. Weinstein helping her . " Cora , stay with Little Ralph ? " Sissie asked . " Sure , do n't worry ' bout him , " Cora said , avoiding her eyes . Sissie and Mrs. Weinstein rode down to the police station , placed charges and Sissie returned home . The next morning Cora told her that they 'd found Ralph at Lewis ' and that he was already in jail . " Good , goddamn him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby was his baby ; he could say that that was why she and Big Ralph had broken up . Sissie felt warm and pleasantly light-headed . She could n't hear the voice of Dr. Clayton any longer . It seemed almost like spring to her , but there was n't any fresh air where she was now nor could she smell the odor of newly blossoming trees . There was an acrid odor in the air . She thought of Big Ralph . The day they had first met . The fascination she had felt seeing him . Had it really been love ? Her eyes stayed tightly closed as she remembered ... . She had been on her way to church . He had stood , his back to a pole , all slicked and duded up . He had smiled at her . He had been crooning , and as she came abreast of him he broke into a light , suggestive song , louder than before . She struggled hard to keep a straight face and only looked at him once . Cora had told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs she turned to look at him and saw thathe had left his pole and had walked up the street behind her a little ways . He waved . She wished he 'd said something so that she could have answered ; she felt that an opportunity had been missed . She paused in the lobby , listening to the strains of the Gloria Patri and hoping that he would step quietly through the door to join her . Choir and parishioners joined : " Praise God from whom all blessings flowPraise him all creatures here below , Praise him all ye heavenly hosts , Praise Father , Son and Holy Ghost , A-a-a-men-n . " His shadow did not fill the doorway behind her and Sissie went quietly into church . She emerged alone at the conclusion of services , for she was still a stranger there and had been in the city but a month . She wished she did n't have to hurry back to serve dinner . She walked slowly homeward , humming the songs that had been sung in church ; she felt as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him again . Sissie slowed . He spun around , looked at her . " Hello , " he said . " Hello , " Sissie answered . She dropped her eyes and keptwalking . " Walk a ways with you ? " Sissie shrugged . " I do n't care . " " Go to church every Sunday ? " " Yes . " She glanced at him . " Your name 's Ralph , is n't it ? " He nodded proudly . " You heard me sing at the Silver Dol-lar ? " Sissie laughed . " No , I just heard about you . " H ! When they passed people on the walk , he stepped aside ,  |p184ti|p|ped  his hat , and Sissie found that she liked that ; he was polite . They walked up a hill . The lawns were bright green , the trees growing heavy with leaves . " You work in private family ? " he asked . " Yes . " " What 's your name ? " " Sissie Peterson . " " From down South ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family and thefarm . " You live here , do n't you ? " She watched him nod . " Most the colored people live in Bloodfield , do n't they ? " Big Ralph shrugged . " Is that a bad place ? I 've never been there . They say it 's bad , with cuttings going on all the time . " " Just like anyplace else , " he said emphatically . She felt his belligerence and said , " Well , you ca n't always believe what people say . " She stopped ; they were in front of the house in which she worked . " Like to go to the moving pictures ? " Sissie nodded slowly ; her eyes danced . " When ? " " I have Thursdays off . " " What time shall I call for you ? " " Three . " She watched his eyes roam over the house ; she saw both envy and intimidation . " You 'll have to come to the rear door , " she said , taking a step in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes clouding for a moment . " Good-bye . " Sissie turned and hurried along the rear walk . Would n't Cora be surprised when she told her ! She rose earlier than usual the Thursday of their first date.  |p185Her  young , farm-toughened body banished sleep at once . She was immediately alert for the sounds of morning : the English sparrows on the elm outside her window , the first robins jerking along on the lawn below , the wagons and horses of the first hucksters heading uphill , the cars . She pulled her kimono around her and stepped quietly into the kitchen which still lay in darkness . She let up the green shades and sunlight instantly filled the room . Then she went to the sugar bowl and lifted it , saw her money . Sissie counted it with a heavy heart ; most of it would have to be sent home . The next payday she would have to buy some things . She wished she could buy another dress-up dress . As it was , when Ralph called that afternoon , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She put up the coffee in a big gray-enameled pot and set the flatiron beside it . Later she would press the dress . Returningto her room , the first she 'd ever had all to herself  --  her sisters Louise and Willa Mae had always shared the same room and bed with her at home  --  she sat down to write a letter and prepare the money for sending . Perhaps before long they could all make their way North and everything would be all right . Before long she heard the Geigers moving about upstairs . They were good , Christian people , Sissie 's father had explainedwhen they sent the money for her fare North . " Hullo , Sissie , " Mr. Geiger said . He always came quietly down the stairs , picked the paper from its door slot and padded into the kitchen . " How 're you this morning ? " His greetings were unvaried . " Hello , Mr. Geiger , " Sissie said , flipping the toast . " How 're you this morning ? " Her answer was as unvarying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first page of the Express . He looked up suddenly . " Sissie , this oilcloth does n't smell very good . Ca n't we do something about it ? " " A good washing does n't seem to help , Mr. Geiger . " Did n't he know that you could n't keep those things on forever and forever ? " I 'll tell Mrs. Geiger to get a new one . " " Yes , sir . " Mrs. Geiger came in , leaned over and kissed her husband 's cheek . " Good morning , Harvey , and good morning to you , Sissie . " " Morning , Mis ' Geiger . " Mrs. Geiger looked pale but she was more spry than usual . " Here 're the eggs . Hot now . " " What are you doing with your day off , Sissie ? " Mrs. Geiger asked . " I expect I 'll be going to a moving picture this afternoon , ma'am . " " Is n't that nice , Harvey ? " Harvey Geiger grunted . He was to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed that the longer Prohibition lasted , the higher prices went . He hastened through his breakfast , reading rapidly . Sissie served them quickly , efficiently , wanting them to finish and leave ; Mrs. Geiger went downtown Thursdays to shop and lunch with friends . Mr. Geiger finished first , as usual , and Mrs. Geiger walked him to the door . She returnedand finished her breakfast in silence , and left the kitchen to dress , Sissie knew . When she finally closed the door behind Mrs. Geiger , Sissie felt a vast relief . How quickly she had come to feel that the house and all its furnishings were hers and that the Geigers were merely bothersome intruders !  |p187Sissie  began to dance through the rooms , then halted before a mirror to primp and pretend that she was a fine lady , finer even than Mrs. Geiger . She would be one day , and she would stand in a beautiful dress and casually remove a cup and saucer  --  Spode  --  from the tray of the maid ; well-dressed people , all speaking well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There would be a Franklin or a Ford or a Chevrolet in the garage . She would be gracious and lovely to Willa Mae and Louise and to her brothers Edward and Agamemnon ; they would look up to her . And Ralph would be there , big and stiff in a tuxedo like Mr. Geiger 's . She skipped upstairs , the nearness of the fantasy making her feel effervescent and generous . Ilow could all these things not come to her ? She entered the Geiger 's bedroom and opened the windows . She approached the bed ; it smelled like stale bread . With tentative fingers she smoothed around the spots and fluffed the pillows . She could not understand why Mrs. Geiger did n't make the bed herself . Did n't she care if Sissie saw the spots ? For a moment Sissic felt uneasy ; she was an uncaring machine , a thing without substance , if the Geigers did n't care if she knew ; it was as if she did n't exist or as if she were invisible , but able nonetheless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had many times before at home . In the bathroom she straightened the towels . Later , when she had pressed her dress , she would return and bathe in the tub ; that was another good thing about Thursdays . Someday , she reflected , she would have all this and more ; she would have the best of everything and would not have to take a back seat to the Geigers or anyone else . She did n't know when that day would be , but that it would come , she had no doubt.  |p188Her  first doubts came some months later when she was going steady with Ralph . For a long time Sissie had been plaguing Ralph in a quiet way to meet his family ; he had seemed ashamed of them . She , on the other hand , talked incessantlyof her father and sisters and brothers and had even let Ralph see photographs of them . Finally he had agreed to arrange a meeting . The Joplins sounded to her as if they were very industrious : Lewis worked for the city ; Alice had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a porter , Sissie guessed ; and Emma , who no longer lived regularly at home , worked in a hotel . Sissie 's eyes shone as they walked toward Ralph 's house , but when they arrived on the main street of Bloodfield , her pace slowed . The farther they proceeded , the shabbier the houses became . Sissie pressed her lips together ; she did not look at Ralph as often now , and he seemed to be avoiding her also . Some of the buildings were worse than the shacks she 'd seen at home . She felt out of place here in her white summer dress and bonnet . She walked gingerly , skirting the sections of the walks where concrete had not been laid . When they stood before Ralph 's house , Sissie wanted to flee . But it was she who said with false joviality , " Let 's go in . " The inside resembled the interiors of the shacks you stumbled across deep in the Piney Woods of Mississippi . There had been something hopeful about the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ralph said disgustedly . Emma stared at Sissie , grimacing , and then threw her arms around Sissie 's neck . Sissie smelled perspiration and gin , baby diapers and food . Emma staggered to a chair . " You know why I 'm drunk ? Wan na know why ? ' Causep189we just ca n't do no better than this . " She dropped her arms . " I 'm the oldest and I ca n't do nothin ' . Been worried about you comin ' , and things bein ' the way they is . Know Ralph done put you off as long as he could . " She smiled drunkenly at Ralph . " You might be good for him , ' cause he done got ashamed of us and maybe he might do himself some good . " Emma tssskked . " Look't you ; you do n't b'long here in all that white , lookin ' lovely as a bride . I do n't wear white ; gets too damned filthy in Bloodfield . I live with Benny ; you know him ; he leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how things is now and again . Had to get outa this damned pigpenmyself , but I ai n't never told nobody this but you . Just could n't stand it . Thing is , we do n't know where to turn ; the mens , they works once in a while . Ai n't a decent job for a black man in town . " She gestured toward Ralph . " All he wants to do is sing . Oh , he can sing all right . Benny says he 's a good singer , considerin ' what this town ai n't got , and that he could be better if he tried , but goddamn it "  --  Emma flung her fists in the air ; her arms were taut . " What 's the point in tryin ' t ' sing for a buncha drunk-ass niggers do n't know singin ' from talkin ' ? " Behind Sissie , Ralph shuffled his feet . He stared at the floor . " Emma , " he said . " Hush ! I 'm talkin ' ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still raised . " It 's hopeless . All you niggers from downSouth comin ' up here lookin ' for streets made outa gold bricks , but they ai n't none . Not one goddamn gold brick , unless 11 you-all gon na shit it . We niggers just like you-all . Onlytrouble is , we livin ' the life you folks was dreamin ' about . This is the way it is . Oh , do n't be thinkin ' about them niggerslivin ' on the side of the hill ; they 's damned few of them ;  |p190it  's us that counts , ' cause we ai n't suckin ' nobody 's ass to live . " Sissie backed up a couple of steps when Emma bent her head in a coughing jag . In the distance they could hear the rattle of the cans moving on their racks at the can company . Sissie felt Ralph 's hand upon her wrist , tugging her gently backward toward the door . " Nice to have met you , " Sissie said . Emma rose unsteadily . " I been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then angrily she shrieked , " Goddamn it , do you think we 'd live like this if we did n't have to ? " Emma gathered her bulk in the door , swelling up to shout at them as they walked rapidly down the street , to the corner , around it in silence . " She was drunk , " Ralph said . They walked a block in silence before Sissie answered , " Yes . " " I do n't know what got into her . " " You always lived there ? " Sissie asked . She saw herself again standing in her white clothes in that dreary , stinking room ; she knew what had got into Emma . " We always lived there . " " And never heard from your father ? " " No , " Ralph said , surprised . His father 's desertion had been accepted as fact the moment he learned of it . " My father would never do anything like that , " Sissie said . " He sent you up here to work and send money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this , " Sissie said half aloud . She was suddenlyfrightened . How many Negroes in tattered clothes had she seen along the railroad tracks in the Northern cities , bent against the rays of the morning sun on her way to the city ?  |p191She  had not seen many Negroes walking big and proud , the way they told of it at home . Maybe Arthur , but on that train he scuffled like a chain-gang nigger . " Listen , " Ralph said , breaking into her thoughts . " I know what you think of my family and where I live . I do n't like it anymore than Emma ; I want something better for myself  --  " They had stopped . Sissie stood watching him . " I got a good , big feeling for you , Sissie . If we got married , maybe together we can have something better . I love you , Sissie  --  " " I could n't live there , " she said in rising horror . " No ! " He said . " We 'll find our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a nice place in Jewtown . Sissie , I want something better than that ! " I le pointed back toward the house . " And I 'd work hard , for you , Sissic ; you 'd never have to want for a thing . Before long , we could live as good as the Geigers . " She had loved him from that first Sunday ; she even had been unable to lie about Arthur ; Arthur had been just another suitor , one she knew she 'd never really have.  |p192BLOODFIELD  , SISSIE THOUGHT , BLOODFIELD . A mask was beingfitted over her face . She could hear the nurses talking . Well , she and Big Ralph had been sure they 'd get out of Bloodfield , but they had n't quite made it . The flat they lived in after they were married was at least out of earshot of the can company , but the railroad tracks that ran down the main street of Bloodfield were inevitably there . Their flat was on the first floor and was approached along an upfaulting sidewalk and across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rooms came from the street-side windows ; the rooms to the rear were oppressively gloomy . The furniture was maple . Linoleum covered all the floors . A narrow dirt road ran along the side of the building andp193led to a blacksmith 's shop . Enough horse dung had gathered to enrich the soil and huge bright sunflowers rose high above the leaning gray fence . The blacksmith was never seen either entering or leaving his shop , was merely heard poundingaway ; sometimes he would sing out , " Whoa , boy ! Whoa , there . . . . " Only two kinds of noises broke the silence envelopingthat house , the rumble of the trains passing , the sudden clatter of ironbound wagon wheels and horses ' shod hoofs . The passing trains moved slowly , their bells tolling , a ghostlike mist rising from beneath the engines . The ground shook . Engineers and firemen leaned from the windows of the cab . Negro porters and waiters could be seen lounging on the platforms between the cars . And white faces stared from window after window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and envious . She thought of home , and of Arthur . Now , though she continued to work at the Geigers , she slept at home . Ralph rose in the morning and walked her to the Geigers . She gave him toast and coffee if the Geigers had not yet arisen . Sissie knew that after Ralph left her he always went to the Silver Dollar . There he 'd talk with the performers or play around with the crystal set that belonged to D'Amica , the cabaret 's owner . The discussions in the Silver Dollar were always the same : why Dempsey was n't fighting Harry Wills , the career of Jack Johnson , the chances of Tiger Flowers , the local Black Hope ; Flowers was a frequenter of the Silver Dollar . After hanging around the club for a few hours , Ralph would go home and take a nap . At six he returned to the Geigers ' to pick up Sissie . After dinner he returned to the club . A large cellar had been renovated to create the Silver Dollar . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with red-striped wallpaper . The bar was small and had a radio set on it during the day ; at night D'Amica took up his post there . Near the bar was a small platform ; it was the bandstand . Red lights were suspendedfrom between the naked rafters ; on special occasions such as Christmas and New Year 's Eve , D'Amica hung a spinning globe from the ceiling which gave off swift , glitteringdimes of light . Sissie was proud when Ralph performed at the Silver Dollar . He came in on cue and sang a note behind the beat , just as the well-known blues singers did on records he played at home . He held his head erect and looked out secretly from beneath lowered lashes . Sometimes his mouth opened so wide that Sissie could see the roof of it . And all the time he moved his legs restlessly . " Sing it , Big Ralph , " Sissie would hear , and smile . " Oh , sing it , Ralphie , " Cora would shriek , glancing at Sissie . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start snapping her fingers and moving restlessly in her seat , wanting Ralph to finish so they could dance and she could be close to him . She enjoyed the nights she was at the club , but they seemed so brief to her . The letters from Louise and Willa Mae made Sissie think of the farm . But why , she wondered , should she have such thoughts when she was married to so prominent a man , and had started life with so many conveniences . Louise and Willa Mae were amazed that she had a flush toilet and electric lights . Did Big Ralph , they asked , have friends ? Sissie basked in their jealousy ; they had wished her ill because she was the one who had been chosen to go North . Instead , she had managed to compound her good fortune . Edward was stillp195home , working and chasing girls on Sunday . Agamemnon had run off ; perhaps , the sisters said , he would find his way to Sissie 's . He did not show up and Sissie was secretly grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church functions , saw moving pictures , visited friends on Sundays . Then one day she discovered she was pregnant . She had believed that , like her mother , she would accept motherhood gracefully . But her condition came as a shock to her . Soon she would not be able to work ; they would have difficulty subsisting on what Ralph made . Their life would suddenly be different . Even Ralph was affected by the news but he did n't say much . Sissie faced her coming imprisonmentwith mounting dread . But there was Arthur and as long as he was in town that summer , she ran about with him . Ralph Joseph Joplin was born at home . Ile was pulled from between Sissie 's trembling legs and slipped into the hands of the visiting nurse . Although the baby was large , Sissie had not had a hard time of it . She started joking almost immediately . " Now , I 'll have to call him Little Ralph , and you Big Ralph . " A week later , despite the payoffs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volstead Act . " But do n't worry , " Ralph said , stroking Sissie 's back . " We 're gon na play house-rent parties and some fraternity dances up on The Hill . Benny 's got it all fixed up . " No one ever made much money from house-rent parties . Sissie sensed that Big Ralph was restless and uneasy . He did n't laugh the way he once had and there were moments when she saw fear lurking in his eyes . " How long will it be before D'Amica opens again ? " she kept asking . She would watch him shrug  --  it would be late at night and they would bep196eating the steak sandwiches Ralph had brought home from a fraternity dance . Big Ralph did n't know when D'Amica would reopen for business . Then one night Ralph told her what she already suspected : he had been in the Silver Dollar , hanging around , when Benny had come in . Benny had wanted some money from D'Amica , but D'Amica had refused to lend him any . " Things do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Ralph . " D'Amica says when he opens up he 's got to pay more for the payoff . He just ai n't got no money . I got to go along with him ; he been awright to me . " It had been hard for Big Ralph to believe that D'Amica was no longer good for a touch . " Looks like , " Benny had said , " all of us better start lookin ' around for some work during the day . " " Why ? " Ralph had asked , frightened , knowing the answer . " He say he ca n't even pay what he been payin ' . And you with that new baby . Goshalmighty , no ! " Benny had twirled the way he did when he was angry or disgusted . " Things gettin ' tight and gon na get worse . I ai n't never been in a place where a colored man could n't do nothin ' . They done finished the highway , and all the porterin ' jobs ' re filled . Goddamn , even down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed hisself . " " That 's right ! " Sissie said , interrupting Ralph 's story . " Benny said , " Big Ralph went on , " that we ought a make the move away from here . He 's goin ' back to Chicago or to New York . He said I could do better there . " Ralph rememberedBenny 's puzzled statement : " Boy , I just do n't see what a man can do here to hold hisself together . " " Not with the baby , " Sissie said.  | " I know , " Ralph said . He did n't tell Sissie that he had alreadybeen around to see his brother Lewis . " Hear the Silver Dollar got raided and closed , " Lewis had said , rolling a cigarette . " Yeah , " Ralph had answered . Lewis never went anywhere except to the movies . He was called the " tightest nigger in Bloodfield . " " But we been playin ' fraternity dances up on The Hill and a few house-rent parties . Did all right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . " " It ai n't none of my business , but you got a little gypsy on your hands . Know what I mean ? " " You mean that railroad man she used to walk with ? He ai n't nothin ' ; she told me all about that . " " Ai n't no woman gon na tell no man all about everything , Ralph . Your wife got some gypsy blood in her and she likes to run . " " Ah , shoot , you 're talkin ' crazy , " Ralph had said . " I need me some day work . " He had watched Lewis fight a smile . " I thought maybe you 'd know of somethin ' . Ai n't much work to be had around here , you know . " Lewis had shrugged and his eyes had become veiled . " I 'll look around . " " I mean , you do n't know of anything right off , do you ? " Ralph had asked , an urgency in his voice . " Not right off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced quickly at his brother . Now , almost finished with his sandwich , Ralph watched his wife tend the baby . If she were cheating on him , he thought he would kill her.  |p198The  Geigers were unwilling to release the girl they now had and take on Sissie again , but through some of the church members Sissic heard about and secured day work in Jewtown . For the first few days Ralph walked with her to the new job at the Weinsteins , but stopped when Sissie remarked , " Honey , you could put your time to better use by lookin ' for work instead of walkin ' me . " The Weinsteins lived in a rambling frame two-story house . The cellars were so large that Mr. Weinstein had let them to a coffin-maker , Moishe Zefner . The acrid scents of Zefner 's oils and powders , his woods and varnishes , hung heavily in the air . Zefner moved about his horses and coffins dressed in a white tieless shirt buttoned all the way up , and black pants which were continually open at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full beard sprayed off light as he bent down to hammer in nails which he pulled studiously from his mouth , one by one . Sometimes when he had just finished a coffin , he would take Sissie 's hand and glide it over the wood . " How fine ? How fine ? " he would say , while Sissie , one arm filled with damp clothes about to be hung on the line , fought against the fear the old man produced in her . Sometimes when he was eating the hot soup Sissie brought to him , he would stare at her and smile and patiently nod his head . Bertha Weinstein gave a robust vigor to the home . She was a fair stocky woman who talked rapidly and moved as quickly . Sissic could not see why this young couple needed help ; the home was spotless . Then she realized that Mrs. Weinstein was lonely and really wanted a companion . Mr. Weinstein was in the furniture business . " Anything you need , Sissie , just let me know and we can git it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over in her breathless fashion . Whenever the offer was made , Sissie would say , " Not right now , " thinking of what the people in Bloodfield said about the Jews . " Girl , work you half to death and give you matzoh balls for pay ! " Or , " They 'll give you things , like they was for free , and come time to get your money and they done took off for what they was supposed to be givin ' you for nothin ! " Nothing like this happened to Sissie , yet when she was at the hairdresser 's she remained silent or nodded diffident acquiescence when such remarks were made , and would feel a twinge of remorse at being disloyal to Mrs. Weinstein . Becauseshe could not buy the things she saw at the Weinsteins , she grew more and more insecure . Now she no longer hurried home to Big Ralph and the baby . 1 ler steps were slow ; she would stop off to visit Cora or sonic other friend . The moment she entered the house she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day . She felt more and more resentment when Mrs. Weinstein gave her dresses and leftoverfoods to carry home . She did n't have much of a chance to take it out on Big Ralph , for usually by the time she was home he was ready to leave for D'Amica 's . It was during one of those periods when she and Ralph were struggling to love each other as they once had that she became pregnant once more . This labor was hard , and Sissie recalled the old saying that a child born in pain leaves home early . The winter Juanitawas born the temperature did n't rise above twenty degrees . First the coal gave out , and then the wood . Coke was cheap but gave little heat . Sissie would sometimes get into bed with the baby and Little Ralph while Big Ralph trudged through the snow to Jewtown to buy a sack of hard coal with bor-P200rowed money . Juanita died of pneumonia just before Little Ralph turned three . Sissie and Ralph went to order a coffin from Mr. Thompkins , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the community . " How much you gon na put down on it ? " Mr. Thompkins wanted to know . Sissie looked first at the old man and then at her husband . " Twenty , " Ralph said . He 'd already told Sissie that D'Amica would certainly advance him that much . " How about after ? " " Man , I 'm gon na pay you ! " Ralph shouted . Sissie rose , frightened . " Ralph , Ralph , " Sissie said . " Mr. Thompkins only wants to do proper business , that 's all . He knows we 're goin ' t ' pay him . " " Awright , Mis ' Joplin , " Mr. Thompkins said , with a dry smile , " I 'll let you have this pretty seventy-five dollar casket , ' cause I know you work hard and you 'll see that it gets paid for . " " Thank you , Mr. Thompkins , " Sissie said , not looking at her husband . " When you gon na gim me that twenty ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mr. Thompkins , who was a trustee in Sissie 's church , always asking for just one more collection to calcimine the church ceiling . " Tomorrow , " Ralph said , taking Sissie 's arm and guiding her out . The day they gathered in the living room with the mourners was gray and cold . Very little light filtered through the windows . D'Amica came , peered into the casket and shook his head . He touched Sissie on the arm and went out . " It isp202sad , " he whispered . Reverend Polk , young and somber , said the eulogy , ending it with , " Suffer little children to come unto Me , and forbid them not ; for of such is the kingdom of heaven . " " Juanita 's sleep . Juanita 's sleep , " said Little Ralph , who sat upon Sissie 's lap , poking at Bertha Weinstein , herself now two months pregnant . " Sit still ! " Sissie cried to Little Ralph , and hit at him . He drew back , tense and watchful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if to mollify the harsh and startled glances which had been turned upon her . She lowered her eyes in shame . Throughout the rest of the services , the long ride to the cemetery morgue where the coffin would lie until the spring thaw , Sissie thought , one less mouth to feed , poor baby , but there 's one less . Sissie shuddered and thought of the chilly flat to which they would return . Sissie went back to work in a frenzy ; so much money was needed to be sent home . Money for foul and rent . Money for bedding and furniture . Always money . If Big Ralph could n't make it , she would . She no longer felt for old ' , doer , though he remained fond of her ; no one else had seemed to care whether he got his soup or not . But now she had fallen silent and introspective . Even she forgot to serve him . When Mrs. Weinstein followed her about , chattering , Sissie pleaded to be left alone . Bertha Weinstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . The quarrels at home became sudden and violent . If Ralph complained that dinner was n't ready she shouted , " Look , you , Ralph , I 've been workin ' all day and I 'm tired . Fix yourselfsomethin ' . No point in my workin ' so hard to keep us togetherif you ca n't pitch in just a little once in a while . " Ralph would shout back , " What the hell you think I'mP202tryin ' to do ? You think I been sittin ' on my ass , not lookin ' ? I do n't give a good goddamn how hard you been out workin ' - when you get your backside in here , remember you 're my wife , and you 're supposed to cook my damned dinner and do n't ever forget it ! " Sissie 's perpetual reply was , " Sure I 'm your wife , but I 'm not the man in the house ; you 're the man , but you do n't act like it . Somebody 's got to be the man here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure ai n't you ! " Ralph would stalk out , slamming the door . Sissie , left in the vacuum of silence which was broken only by the questions put to her by her son , would ask herself , Why could n't he find work ? Why was it that all the men paced the streets mornings , heads bent , steps slow ? At what point had she become the man and he less than the man he had seemed to be ? Sissie stroked the head of her son without looking at him . How long would this go on ? The women could always find work in some kitchen someplace . She remembered what Emma had said : looking for bricks made of gold . That was the way they 'd told it at home . Freedom up there ; do what you want , go where you pleased , speak what you chose . Freedom . But some of what was down there seemed to be up here . Different , but the same : keep you raggedy and nervous . If you had the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in the North , but if you did n't have the money ... ? Always after the arguments she felt contrition . Ralph was n't there , and so she would embrace Little Ralph , and talk to him . He would smile gratefully and Sissie would know that she was away too much . She would get him ready for bed , as the trains passed . The trains would remind her ofp203Arthur . She needed someone who had been untouched by this decay , this hopelessness , this chaos  --  someone who would make her feel like a woman instead of a drayhorse . Whenever her husband returned , she was grateful . Even if he had been drinking , she was grateful . After they had had one particularly violent argument , he returned , drunk and remorseful . They made love with recklessdesperation . When spring came she could not accept the possibility of her third pregnancy , and again she fled wildly through the soft nights to Arthur . The summer that followed was the summer Big Ralph had tried to kill her.  |p204BIG  RALPH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stood in the warm office looking into the garage where his truck was being fueled . Impatiently he pounded his feet against the floor . Standing and waiting there brought back the old jail-house fever . No one had come to visit him in prison but Lewis . " You doin ' all right ? " Lewis had asked , studying Ralph , who was seated behind the wire . " I guess so , " Ralph had answered , pulling a hangnail . " You do n't look so good . " Somehow or other Lewis always said the wrong thing . " I brought you some Duke 's Mixture . Had to leave it with the guard . He 'll give it to you later . " Ralph had nodded and had studied his fingernails . Ralphp205sensed that Lewis was enjoying seeing him in jail . It was as if they had been returned to childhood ; Lewis was once more the superior . He had never been in jail . " They got a band here so you can keep in practice ? " Lewisasked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated . " Maybe it 's a good thing ; maybe you should go into something else when you get out . You 're getting time off for good behavior if you do n't mess up . And the connections I made . . . . Besides , it was only your wife , or leastways , that 's how they look at it . If it 'd been a white man  --  " Lewis smiled . " Listen , they started takin ' colored on some of the trash crews . I think I can get you a job hauling ashes . " " How 's Sissie ? " ' What ? " Ralph looked directly into his brother 's eyes for the first time . " I said , how 's Sissie ? " " She 's gone , " Lewis said bleakly . Ralph 's fingers shot through the wire . " Gone ? Gonewhere ? " " Goddamn it , sit down . " Lewis looked hastily at the guard . " I do n't know . Someone told me last month . Saw her gettin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Damnhit , I told you I did n't know . Besides , what the hell you want to worry about her for ? " Lewis said quickly , drawingback from the wire . " I hear she 's pregnant . " Big Ralph sagged . " I told you so , " Lewis mumbled . Ralph stared at him with dull eyes and then went back to pulling at the hangnail . In a hoarse voice he said , " Where 's the boy ? " " She put him in the City Home . "  | " She just went off and left him ? " " I guess so , " Lewis said impatiently . " You got enough to worry about . I 'll look after the boy , me and Emma and Alice . We 'll see to him . " A relieved smile started across Ralph 's face . " Thank God , yes . Take him outa there  --  " Lewis moved quickly in his seat . " I did n't mean  --  hell , I 'm working all the time , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralph said grimly , " And Alice with her own kids . . . . " " I meant we 'd send things and maybe go by and see him , " Lewis said angrily . " What did you want us to do , anyway ? " He paused . " Now you stop worryin ' . That boy 's gon na be all right . He 's tough , like you . " Lewis had left and had returned ten months later on the day that Ralph was freed . The world lay just outside Auburn prison which hugged close to U.S. Highway zo . Ralph and Lewis had walked from the prison to the bus station without once looking back . It was turning spring and , as they moved past the gently rolling fields , Big Ralph said tonelessly , " It 's good to be out . " The fields were heavy with the odor of horse manure , and the first shoots of green hung like mist around them . " Yes , yes , it must be , " Lewis said . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to haul trash and ashes all right . " " It 's all fixed , then ? " " I told you not to worry about it , " Lewis said . Lewis laughed . He elbowed Ralph and winked , passing him the sack of Duke 's Mixture . " It pays to have a politician in the family , hey boy ? "  |p207Ral|ph  poured the tobacco without stopping and rolled a cigarette . He ran the stick match along his behind without breaking stride and applied the flame to the cigarette . He handed the sack back to Lewis . " No word from Benny ? " " No , Silver Dollar 's the saint , though ; that wop D'Amica is still rakin ' in the money . I do n't know what 's worse , Jews or wogs . " Big Ralph was silent . " That music . It had to end sometime . Maybe other places it goes good , but not here . Besides , you got that boy to look after now . " Ralph nodded , but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralph lapsed into silence . Sissie gone , Benny gone , old Mis ' Clark dead . A different world . There were only twenty sonic odd miles from Auburn to the city . The road ran along flat terrain which gave way in the east to a series of green gullies and one large hill . The trip seemed only to have begun when it was at an end . They got out of the bus near the square where the soldiers and sailors monument stood , and began walking briskly out along the broad thoroughfare where mansions stood surrounded by deep green lawns . They puffed up a hill , turned and panted up another , steeper hill . Across the street were the untended playgrounds of the City Home . The swing racks were still empty , the teeter-totter supports bare , the struts for the shoot-the-chutes , naked . Ralph felt an unrest in his stomach as they crossed the street and entered the wide , low building that reeked of urine . It took them only fifteen minutes to find Little Ralph . Something went out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped forward and said softly , accusingly , " Daddy ? " P208Big Ralph picked the boy up and busied himself buttoning the boy 's clothing . He put him on his back and carried him down the hills , across the city and home . They sat in the dark flat with its Salvation Army furniture that Lewis had rented for them , looking at one another . Lewis had gone , leaving five dollars behind . " You want some ice cream , son ? " Big Ralph asked , wishingthe boy would smile . " Yes . " Ralph held out his hand and felt an undefined elation when the boy took it without hesitation . They went down the stairs to the corner store , passing the Fro-Joy ice-cream sign fastened on the door . Afterward they walked around the corner to Cora 's . Cora Boatwright embraced them both . " Big Ralph , " she sighed . " Sure is good seeing you again . " She looked down at the boy , watched him with ice-cream cone for a moment . " And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , well , well . " She led them into the kitchen . " You folks have got to eat , I know . " " We were goin ' to the restaurant , " Ralph said . " That ai n't no place for a child . Least of all the first day out for you an ' for him . Sit down there and hush . " The meal did not take long to prepare . Cora kept up a running conversation . " You start workin ' tomorrow , do n't you , Ralph ? " " Yeah , on the trash and ash trucks . " " You all through singin ' ? " " All through , Cora . " " Ai n't been the same at the Silver Dollar with you and Benny gone . "  |p209Big  Ralph looked at his son . " I guess it 's all over , Cora . " " It 's a shame . You sure could sing ! " Ralph laughed . Ile looked at her . The impact of being away ten months struck softly home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place 's all fixed up , Lewis tells me , but maybe I 'd better step over there later and take a look . I know how Lewis is with a dollar . Cheap . Tight . He 'd make the Indian on a nickel straddle the buffalo . " She looked straight at him . " All right ? " " All right , Cora . " The thought was full upon him now , warm and all out of proportion . " Better put the boy to bed early , " she said gently . " I ' spect he 's had a full day . " " Sure , he 's been a busy little somcthin ' . " " Heard from Sissie ? " The question startled him . " No , " he mumbled . " If you want , I 'll bring her address with inc . " She stopped serving and gave him that bold open look . " You want it ? " He mumbled again with head bent , " Yes , please . " Black Tiger Flowers was Ralph 's throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trash truck , on foot , bursting the still mornings with cries of " Whoap ! " or " Okay , hold it ! " The dumper was a small man ; he rode in the van and steadied the containers as they came flying up . He upendedthem , dragged them empty and kicked them down again to Ralph or Black Tiger Flowers . The driver was an Italian , a politician two rungs above the lowest on the patronageladder . He left his cab only to eat , submit to the evacuatorydemands of his body , and to quit at the end of the day . Nearly every morning Tiger was still drunk from the nightp210before or nursing a hangover . Tiger was a half-head taller than Ralph and broader . He was built and looked not unlike a gorilla . He walked sometimes with a half-stride and a halfshuffle , moving along sideways like a crab . At his peak in the ring Tiger wore specially made white gloves and shoes which contrasted sharply with his indigo skin . Ralph remembered him from those days ; they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory in the Silver Dollar clad sportily in plus fours and wide plaid cap . He bought drinks ; he had women . And then he began losing fights . Lack of training , the Express said . Tiger was losing so often that the time had come when the fans had bellowed unashamedly in the Arena , " Kill the niggeh ! Kill the niggeh ! " Week after week it was the same story : Tiger backpedaling , his skinny shanks like brittle sticks , his bulgeless rump shivering beneath the silk pants , sliding on his big feet and flailing with his now comical white gloves , more to cut the smoke than to strike his opponent . The night he appeared low on the card in black shoes and wine-colored gloves the fans stopped yelling ; Black Tiger Flowers had himself acknowledged that he was through . Now Tiger danced , when he and Ralph began throwing togetherfrom trash can to trash can , snuffling , hooking and crossing his great fists . " Keeping in shape , Ralph , " he explained . " Go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recapturing the instant of past glory , would slip an open hand up against Ralph 's face  --  a mock knockout blow , and cry , " Uh-huh ! " and freeze there smiling toughly as if waiting for the photographers . If the photographers did come again , Ralph reflected , it would be for murder ; now Tiger roamed the streets on fight nights , his white gloves on , beatingup visiting white sports and blacks he did n't know.  |p211Little  Ralph was sitting on the stoop , Sissie remembered , watching the white boys play steps with a dirty tennis ball . Sissie held the baby in one arm , with her other hand she gripped her bag . She wondered if the child ever played with the other boys . He looked lonely seated there . She was here , finally , after coming all that way by bus ; after dingy Southsiderooms in Chicago and the old down-home sisters who had looked at her as if she were a whore because she had had a baby ; Sissie had wanted to shout that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a mistake . She had longed for the sanctity of home and husband , had cried many nights thinking about Little Ralph . She wished she had taken him with her . But drying her tears , she would realize that had she brought him they would surely have starved . It had been bad enough leaving the baby with strangers while she walked to Drexel Boulevard and back to do the day 's work . It had been the graciousness of God that had directed Big Ralph back to her . Now Sissie was closer to her son . 1 lc had that look of being angry and melancholy at the same time , the look Agamemnon had had . Sissie put her bag down . The boy looked just like hisfather . He was so intent watching the game that he did n't notice her . Sometimes his pink tongue flicked out to wet his dry , dark lips ; sometimes he kicked his legs in joy , pleased by the progress of the game . " Little Ralph ? " Sissie said , smiling nervously . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face went blank . " What ? " he asked defiantly , suspiciously . " You know who I am ? "  |p212He  pressed his lips together . He rolled his eyes at her , at the bag , at the baby . Sissie hissed , " I 'm your mother , boy ! " Little Ralph smiled uncertainly . " My mother ? " he asked tentatively . " My mother ? " and he broke into a sudden grin , as if he 'd just caught on to a joke . The baby whimpered . " Hush , baby , " Sissie crooned . She struggled up the stairs , fretting at the darkness and at the unsteadyrailing . She breathed heavily when she got to the top . The door to the flat was half-open . She pushed against it with her bag . Big Ralph was n't there . He could n't be far off , she thought , not with Little Ralph downstairs on the stoop . And it was Sunday , the day she had agreed to return so that he would be home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled the baby on the bed , and changed its diaper . She looked around the flat ; it was pleasant enough ; the odor of fresh paint was there , and the furniture was new and substantial . The furniture made her think of the Weinstein 's . The flat would be a little crowded with four people living in it , but Iris was n't grown ( neither was Little Ralph , really ; he was n't even in school yet ) , and they 'd be in another place  --  a little farther from Bloodfield  --  by the time she got up to some size . Little Ralph 's voice wavered up the stairs : " Daddy , some woman 's upstairs . She got a baby . Daddy  --  is she my mother ? " The last word was pitched low , in almost a whisper . Sissie did n't hear Big Ralph 's reply . Instead there was a crashing up , up , and up the stairs . He burst through the door and came to a stop in the bedroom . " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the bed where she sat , studying her husband.  |p213Ral|ph  's eyes wandered from Sissie to the baby and back . " Are you all right ? " he asked . His eyes dropped to her throat and then he looked quickly away . " Uh-huh , " she answered . " I 'm all right . " Big Ralph took a deep breath . " The baby all right ? " " She 's fine . " " What 's her name again ? " He moved forward and crouched down to see the baby . " Iris . " " That 's pretty . She looks like you , " he said . Sissie detected the relief in his voice ; no matter how hard he looked he would not have found any resemblance to Arthur . " Do you like the name ? " she said . " I like it . " " If you want to change it  --  " " No , I like it . Are you tired ? " " It was a long trip . I am , kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah . Why do n't you get some rest ? " " Maybe I 'd better fix something for Little Ralph ; it 's close to dinnertime . " " He just ate a little while ago . That 's why he 's downstairs ; likes to go play after he eats . " " He did n't know me , " Sissie said . " I did n't want to leave him with those rowdy folks we knew . That 's why I left him at the City Home . " Her eyes were averted . " Besides , it was awful in Chicago . I do n't know what would 've happened to us if there 'd been another mouth to feed . Imagine , in this day and age and in this country , worryin ' about another mouth to feed . " " That 's all right about the City Home , " Ralph said , and hep214was not looking at her either . " He knew you . He was just playing , " he said . " He 's a playful little cuss sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand  --  " " No , he did n't know me , but I 'll make him love me again . " " Sure you will . " In the silence which came then , Sissie toyed with the baby . Ralph lit a cigarette and watched them ; his smile was stiff . " How 'd you like that Lindy ? " he said , to break the awkwardnessof the silence . Sissie brightened at once . " Was n't that good ? Now you know God had to be with that boy . All that way alone over all that ocean . That was good , " she said , shaking her head . " Yeah . Hear about those two Italians who got executed last month ? " " Them Reds ? Oh yes , I heard about them . " Sissie breathed deeply ; it had n't been so bad . She looked at her husband , then lowered her eyes , waiting . Big Ralph said , " Get some rest , girl . I know you got to do for the baby and all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's crazy about ice cream . What shall I bring back for you ? " Sissie pretended to think , then said , " Oh , nothin ' right now , thanks . " Ralph looked at the baby again . " Iris ? " Sissie said , " Iris . "  |p215TWO  YEARS LATER Sissie and Ralph moved to Jewtown . Jewtownlay but a few blocks south of Bloodfield . Trees were plentiful in this area which was only a mile or two square and had acquired its name because Polish and Russian Jews lived there . Jewtown , however , was not predominantly Jewish ; the Jews were most heavily concentrated on the streets in the Joplins ' immediate neighborhood . Two frame synagoguesstood within a block of each other ; on Saturdays the sidewalks in front of the building were crowded with worshipers ; on weekdays one saw reluctant schoolboys entering the basementson their way to cheder . The street on which the Joplins lived was entirely lacking in racial homogeneity . At one end of the block stood anp216Italian restaurant and beside it a bocci court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of the city . Facing the Italian establishment was an Irish diner from which emanatedthe odors of stew and corned beef and cabbage . Ransom 's adjoined the diner . Ransom sold hair pomades for both sexes , cheap perfumes , and penny candies and cigarettes . There was always a stale smell in this small gloomy shop . At Ransom 's one could also pick up the Chicago Defender and the Vigilante . The latter was a Negro sheet , four pages long , dedicated to the promulgation of protest and gossip ; Ransom , an irritable twig of a man , considered himself a militant . But this did not prevent him from being in the policy racket . In addition to taking numbers and acting as the Jewtown drop , he took care of the weekly payoff to the occupants of Police Car 26 . Across the street from Ransom 's was the only Negro barbershop on that side of town . Whenever Sissie passed by , Gideon and his customers waved . Gideon had moved from Bloodfield , his instinct having told him that the swelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would overflow into Jewtown . And he knew that his clientele would follow him wherever he went . Since Gideon cut white as well as Negro hair , he reasoned that he could pick up additional business in Jewtown . Gideon was a true democrat , a veteran of the war ; he knew every liberal cliche . Alpert 's was lit by neon and crammed with barrels of dill pickles and herring , and every variety of delicatessen . The lush scents of this market mingled on the street with the odors from Saslow 's Fish Market . Volinsky and Bloom , bakers , competed with one another , filling their windowsp217with popovers , half-moon cookies , cakes and tarts ; Guido 's sat between them  --  his shop had the sharp scent of Italian sausage and cigars . Schor 's was the kosher butcher shop ; Ayling the nonkosher . Ayling was bitter because Schor 's 11 business was so heavy . Two more fish markets and an ice and coal house completed the commercial aspect of the neighborhood . High above on a hill stood the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooty Gothic towers was visible from Jewtown . From that tower came the majestic sound of the chimes played by the Delta Kappa Epsilon boys . Perhaps the chimes were responsible for the odd bond that joined the university and Jewtown . Generally the chimes were played twice a day , at eight in the morning and at noon , but during the football season they were also used to announce victories with a medley of fight songs . Because Mr. Weinstein had attended the university , Sissie and her family felt even closerthan most to the school . The Weinsteins never missed a game , would go off leaving their son with Sissie . Invariably they returned bringing pennants and celluloid football dolls. for the Ralphs , Big and Little . It was with the commoners ' amused tolerance that theresidents of Jewtown lined the streets to watch the students snake-dance down from the hill in their annual " Beat Colgate " parade , Torches fared , the streets abounded with clean-looking , block-lettered youth . The people of Jewtown dimlyhoped that their children someday would be students , snake- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Warily , sometimes , Sissie rummaged through her dreamsand thought what all the other Jewtowners were thinking . One day , perhaps , that rare black face in the crowd of stu/dents might be her daughter or son . And Big Ralph himself , carried away by bathtub beer , often haltingly voiced the possibilitythat his son would become a football star . " A natural little atha-lete , " he would say proudly , and Sissie , pleased , would snort and smile . The municipal garage cut its trash crews , but Big Ralph promptly got a job with an asphalt contractor . Sometimes on her way to work , Sissie passed the asphalt gang . It was composed entirely of Negroes and reminded her of the chain gangs she had seen at home . With their shoes wrapped in tattered and tarred burlap , the men raked and shoveled the steaming asphalt . When the asphalt was in place , they took the thumpers and patiently pounded the tar , and then stood back to let the steamroller finish the job . But it was work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side in bed . It was work a man could put his back and shoulders to ; he felt good at the end of the day . In the darkness Sissie smiled . Sissie had not seen her father for years , and then he came to visit . His hands were gnarled and he had very little hair . Joseph Peterson  --  Sissie 's father  --  was as large as Big Ralph , and with or without his spectacles on , his eyes were keen , as if he had spent a long time looking at great distances . He still had that manner of speaking rapidly , clipping his words . He brought with him the odor of open windswept places and of sun and slow-moving water . Sissie even imagined one time that the smell of Sephora the mule had come with him as well . The smells were enough to set her thinking again of the land he was trying to keep . He had not discussed the farm with her , but she knew that he had come to see if there was some way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wouldp219the white folks really be able to take the land away ? He kept saying things were going all right , and this only made Sissie feel worse . It was as though she were no longer a part of the family . But suppose she and Ralph took the kids South to help out ? Ralph would more than make up for the loss of Agamemnon . And he 'd scare those crackers into some sense . She would be there to help Willa Mae and Louise . The kids would enjoy being out of doors . These thoughts were pure fantasy , Sissie knew . Big Ralph would never go South , and neither , she reflected , would she , except to visit . That was all behind her . Bad though it was up here , it was better than the South . Here , at least , you could delude yourself . Poor Poppa . Agamemnon gone , to God knew where , and soon Edward , his loyalty exhausted , would leave . Eventually Louise and Willa Mae would also journey North . " Sissie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iris . It was a Sunday afternoon and Ralph and the boy had gone to a baseball game . Sissie watched him place his thumb in the Bible he was reading . He peered over the tops of his glasses , an indication that a serious discussion was about to break . " You sure acts funny about that little girl of yours , Like you scared to be decent to her when your husband 's around . " " Oh , Poppa , " she said . " Do n't turn away when I 'm speaking , girl . Is everything all right ? Is there somethin ' you have n't told me that you should have ? " " No , Poppa . " " Sissie ? " His voice was a warning that she should n't lie to him . " Sir ? "  | " You sure ? " " Yes , Poppa . " " He 's a good boy , " Joseph Peterson said , reopening his Bible . " A good of nigger . Be good for farm work . Man ai n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livin ' so close together . Ca n't even see the sky half the time . Do n't know what 's goin ' t ' happen . All the young folks leavin ' home to come up North as fast as they can save bus fare . " " Yes , Poppa . " Long after her father had gone Sissie pondered over that afternoon . Surely she was as devoted to Iris as she was to the boy ? Why had her father said that she was n't ? And Big Ralph liked the girl ; he had been stiff with her at first , but that had passed . Sissie chuckled . No use telling Ralph now and raking up the past . Some day , she thought , she would tell him , but things were going along so good . Even the bad luck ( Sissie paused to rap on wood ) , seemed to be staying away . Big Ralph entered singing one of his old favorites . " Down the street come Sat'dy night Head held high and walkin light Come Big Stingaree ! Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls is glad when he say : It 's Big Stingaree ! Wheel Stingaree ! Stings sweet all night ' n ' works all day Fells them logs ' n ' sleeps in th ' hay Ol ' Stingaree ! Big Stingaree . . . ! " He winked at Sissie and said , " Watch out for the stinger , Sissie . " She knew that they would make love that night.  |p221They  did not know where Wall Street was or precisely how , if at all , they were related to it and the collapse of the stock market . But the next night when Ralph came home he called to Sissie in a loud cheerful voice from the cellar , " Honey , I 'm gon na take as much of this stuff off my clothes as I can . You go ahead and wash ' cm ; ca n't tell when they 'll call me back . " Sissie paused in her work ; for a moment she wanted to cry because the tone of his voice had been confident . Lately , it seemed , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that made her feel good . When he came up into the kitchen he said , " Ol ' Wiggins tells me he 's goin ' to workthe State Fair , in the toilets . Gon na go upstairs and talk to himabout helpin ' out . " " Oh , " she said impulsively , " I was just thinkin ' that I could go the full week at the Weinsteins ' . " That too was something she had been feeling lately , the wish to give him something tangible ; something that would tell him that she loved him " Let 's see how this goes , " he said , laughing deep in his throat . " Ca n't be as bad as they say it is . Besides , you got the kids here to look after . " He patted her on the buttocks and I went upstairs to see Wiggins . The kids , Sissie thought when he had gone , the kids . How they circumscribed your life . Instead of a new chair , you bought a mattress for the crib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . She tried not to think about it anymore , and she worked briskly until Ralph returned , smiling . He went cheerfully the first morning , garbed in Wiggins ' extra white jacket . He said nothing about the job when he returned home late that night . Something was wrong , Sissiep222knew ; she had wanted to talk and laugh with him . In the morning when she rose , she saw that he had n't touched the supper she 'd left him . She was unable to really approach him during the time he worked at the State Fair . Perhaps he would tell her what was bothering him when the job was all over . They had been in charge of a toilet in the cattle building , Ralph finally told her . They had set up a shoeshine stand and bought paper and cloth towels . When the farmers had come in , smelling of home brew and cow dung , Wiggins and he had stepped forward to brush them off , chanting as they did : " Shake it high , shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . " " One farted in my face , " Ralph said quietly , " and I could 've killed him . " Sissie remained silent . " Them peckerwoods , " he said bitterly . " So goddamn big ' cause they give you a lousy nickel or a dime . Damned few of them had dimes . It must make them happy to be able to give you things instead of getting the hell outa the way and lettin ' you get them yourself . " " I 'm glad you did n't fight , " Sissie said . " I would n't want anything to happen to you . " " 01 ' Wiggins , " Ralph said with a morose smile . " He was pretty good at suckholin ' around . Yassuh , boss . Yassuh , cap'n . ' You know what I found out , Sissie ? " " What ? " " I could n't make a nickel until I acted just the way he did . I did n't feel like a man ; I felt like an ape , grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sambo talk . " Quietly , Sissie said , " But honey , we had to have money . "  | " Why else , " he said in abrupt harshness , " did you think I did it ? " " We 're too poor to be proud , " she said , quietly again . " Nobody 's that poor . That 's all a poor man has , his damned pride , which he ca n't give his family to eat . " " No . " " Stopped by to see Lewis today . " Sissie waited ; if anybody knew of a job it was Lewis . " He 's got an eye out . " " That 's nice . A little resell be good for you . " " We all paid up at Guido 's and Ayling 's ? " " Except for the Wings you got yesterday . " Sissie thought of old man Guido with his little account book in which he recorded the items they bought on credit ; and she thought of Ayling who she was sure added fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's good , " Ralph said , wearily . " Coin ' out on the porch for a while . " Sissie nodded . What did he think of as he stood on the porch night after night , smoking cigarette after cigarette ? From the bedroom she could watch the red dot of his cigaretteglowing and fading . Once she had known almost everythingabout him , now she knew nothing . She stayed awake that night , waiting for him to come to bed . She was alive with love ; she had almost made up her mind to tell him about Iris . She watched his cigarette glow in the dark . IIe kept smoking one cigarette , then another . She finally fell asleep . From Wings cigarettes he switched to Bull Durham rollyour-owns ; thirteen cents was too much to pay for a wholep224pack when you could roll a mess of good cigarettes for a nickel . Mornings , Sissie watched him go out in search of work , his face expressionless . He would be home by noon , before Little Ralph came back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or went down to the cellar and sifted the precious , half-burned pieces of anthracite from the ash , sprinkling them with water . Every day he visited D'Amica 's . " Maybe I 'll hear of something there , " he said . He got two or three houses to paint , some flats to wallpaper , some trash to carry out . But such work was irregular . " I 'm going to go full time at the Weinsteins , " Sissie announced . " She 's been wantin ' me more . " " Who 's going to look after Iris ? " Ralph asked ; his voice was low and menacing . Sissie knew that Ralph knew the answer . " On the days when you go out , " Sissie said , watching him carefully , " you can leave her with Mis ' Wiggins . She 'll fix lunch for Little Ralph too . " " You talked to her already , " he said . His voice was an accusation . " It 's only until you start some steady work , Ralph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shouted , slamming the wall . " Ai n't no more corners to cut , " Sissie said , suddenly unafraid . " Guido 's lookin ' at me fish-eyed . The kids got to have more than neckbones and rice or hoppin ' - john all the time . Cornbread and hoecake bread . . . . " her voice drifted wearily . She watched him go to the porch . A clamor arose in the street . She saw him look up as an airship passed overhead ; a soft , distant look came into his eyes . Sissie backed away from thep225window so that he could not see her . When he came in she said , " I do n't see why you have to be mad . " He shrugged . " It 's only for a little while , " she repeated . " If it 's only for a minute , " he said , brushing past her , " it makes me feel as useless as a ball of cowshit . " " Ralph  --  " " Go ahead , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But what else can we do ? " she pleaded . He shook his head . " What else ? " 1Ie shook his head again . " Nothing . " Two weeks later , she approached him as he sat in the kitchen reading the sports page of the Express . She held a pencil and paper in her hand . " Honey ? " she said , sitting down . " What ? " " Listen . There 's an upstairs flat around the corner . Ten dollars a month cheaper than this . Same number of rooms .... " She watched him deliberately lay the paper aside . He fixed her with a cold stare . " Honey , please listen , " Sissie said . " Wegot to figure out how to stay alive . No furnace , so we I ; ' I can get a couple of pot-bellied coal stoves . Cheaper . " His eyelids flickered . " Just for now , Ralph . We 're scratchin ' andscratchin ' and do n't seem to be able to get ahead at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wondered . There was many a man out there in the street who 'd be happy to have the use of herbrains . She went on more firmly . " Mrs. Weinstein can get me some washing to do at home . " She shoved the paper at him and pointed with the pencil to some figures . " Bring in eight dollars , and saving ten on the move , that 's eighteen dollars , honey . "  |p226He  nodded . His eyes passed over the table , lingered a moment on the paper then drifted back to hers . " Okay ? " she asked . " Sure , " he said , closing his lips tightly . " You 'll have to pick up the laundry for me  --  " The noise of his fist hitting the table startled her . " I 'm a fuckin ' man , " he said rising . " Why in the hell ca n't I be one ? What 's makin ' it so that I ca n't be one ? " Sissie lowered her head . She stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would he hit her ? She closed her eyes and waited . A second or two passed . She opened her eyes . He was still standing motionless . " Okay , " he said , wavinghis hands . " Okay , okay , okay . " They were only a single block away from the old flat , but it seemed miles . They could not see the university , and though they heard the chimes , the bells no longer held any special meaning for them . The street they were on was cobbled . Trolley tracks no longer in use glinted malignantly in the sun . Devoid of trees , the block seemed a desert , the community a ghost town : there were almost no customers in the Greek store at the corner , a weariness hung in the show window of the pawnshop , and there was the dingy gloom of the ice-cream parlor with its marble-topped counter and three-cent phosphates . From the pretzel bakery next door to the new flat came the perpetual odor of baking ; roaches and rats also came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always filled in the morning . Ralph was constantlycovering rat holes with the tops of cans , but the rats always found new entrances . A year , two years passed  --  each day sullen and precarious . But at night they sought each other , as if this were the lastp227escape left to them . Sissie felt that each time they made love , Ralph sought to reassert himself . But when it was over Sissie could only think of rising in the morning and going out to earn their bread . She wanted him to be a man but knew he could n't ; vaguely she perceived that the fault was not his , yet she could n't find out whose fault it was . When she found him struggling with the wash or trying to iron she became frenzied . Soon he gave up helping at all . Nights he sat silently in the kitchen while she ironed . She was quiet , knowing that too much anger was dangerous , but the thought of working day after day kept plaguing her . Something had to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she discovered that she was once more pregnant , she obtained some quinine ; taking quinine , she had heard , would bring on an abortion . At the Weinsteins ' she tried jumping from the top of the stairs . Finally she stopped doing anything about it and spent night after night crying in Ralph 's arms . Why had n't they been more careful ? What would they do with another child ? How could you raise a family in the place in which they lived ? Ralph said he was going to try harder than ever to find work . Sissie lay in his arms , her face wet with tears , and knew he had lost hope . She had seen the long lines of desperate men ; she had passed Gideon 's where the job seekers congregated in the afternoons . Like them , Ralph was beaten . She knew he would find nothing and that they would have to go on relief . As if the new pregnancy were not enough , Little Ralph had taken to running away . Sometimes he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much , " Ralph commented one evening when the boy was gone.  | " Well you do n't hardly at all , " Sissie snapped back . He 's got to be disciplined . " " No cause to tear the skin off his back . " " I never , but he 'll get it when he gets back here . " Ralph said , " He do n't never leave unless you been beatin ' on him . I do n't know where he can be ; looked every place I could think of . What 'd he do , Sissie ? " " Lost some money in the snow . " " Kids always lose money . " " We ca n't afford to , we 're poor . " " Never mind . He 'll be back . " He always did return , and would patiently receive his beating . There was a sullen rebelliousness within him . Once , when Little Ralph had forgotten what he was to get at the store and returned with the wrong thing , Sissie snatched up the leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of time and of reality ; the strap snarled through the air again and again . " Cry , damn you , " Sissie hissed , her breath growing short . When she saw the hatred in his eyes she beat harder . It did n't seem as if she could ever stop . Suddenly she was jerked upright . She whirled and saw the angry face of her husband . He tore the belt from her hand and hit her across the buttocks with it , once , twice , three times , deliberately and with all his strength . He looked her in the eyes and then threw the belt on the floor and walked out . Sissie touched her hips and felt the three welts there . She looked unbelievinglyat the boy and knew the extent of her blind rage , the infiniteness of his hatred for her . Her legs felt rubbery , her knees sagged and she found herself crouching on the floor , like an animal , crying and sobbing . " I did n't mean it , " she repeated over and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , honey , Mother did n't mean it . I 'm sorry . Did Mother hurt you ? Mother 's sorry . Mother 's sorry . Come , let Mother hold you ? " Sissie lifted her head and waited . " Come , " she said , frightened , " let Mother hold you . " Moving stiffly , Little Ralph sidled slowly around her out of the bedroom . He picked up his lumber jacket and cap which were on the chair beside the door , bent to see if his jackknife was still in the little pocket on the side of his high-topped boots , then , like his father , he walked out . Slowly , Sissie rose to her feet when she heard the downstairs door slam . She washed her face and picked up the baby . She hugged Iris to her bosom . Now Sissie attended church more frequently than ever before ; Ralph and Iris were sent to Sunday school . But Mr. Thompkins was always asking for another collection to repair the parsonage in which Reverend Polk lived : there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew bored and angry with all of this begging ; none of the people in the congregation had money . Various groups organized church dinners and those who could afford to attend retired to the basement after the service for the meals . Some of the parishioners invited their employers to these dinners . ReverendPolk always introduced the guests , their names having been slipped to him before church . The strangers sat in the last pew during the service and ate at the special table set aside for that purpose . There was something so pretentious and false about those dinners that Sissie never invited the Weinsteins . The rats and roaches came day and night that summer . Soap and water and scrubbing did n't help . One morning , preparing to go to work , Sissie looked into the childrens ' room . Something gray streaked across the floor . Sissie stared ,  |p230then  screamed . Iris ' face was trickling blood . Little Ralph had his hands raised in horror . Sissie heard Big Ralph running toward the room . She herself stood as if hypnotized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curled , crouched , frozen . Big Ralph reached for the rolling pin and ran into the room with a shout . The rat ran madly across the room . Big Ralph lunged , scattering the children , and the rat tumbled gray and hideous upon the floor under the crib . Big Ralph kept clubbing it , shouting as he did , " Goddamn you ! Goddamnyou ! " The room was filled with the stench of the creature . Ralph wiped up the mess of blood and fur with some newspaper . Sissie dressed the wound on Iris ' face . When she returned home from work that evening , Big Ralph said , " We 're moving tomorrow . " " But Ralph  --  " she began . " Goddamn it , we 're moving ! " he said sharply . Then she saw the bare cupboards , the pans out on the table , the boxes already packed . " Where ? We do n't even have money to pay the moving man . " " Son , " he called to Little Ralph , " bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step on it . " Sissie looked at the boy ; he was smiling at his father . " Hello , " Sissie said . " Hello , Mother . " " Attaboy , " Big Ralph said , taking some pans from Little Ralph . " More now . Hurry . " " Where we movin ' ? " Sissie asked , sitting down . " One seventy-nine Horn Street . Near Asher 's ice and coal house . " " You mean that big upstairs flat with the screens all around the porch ? "  | " Yep . " " But that 's expensive . " " I jewed the landlord down . Three dollars more than this place . Got some money from Lewis , " Ralph said proudly . " We ca n't stay here no more , honey . It 's too awful . You rest awhile . We ate already , so do n't worry about it . I 'll get the kids off to school in the morning and then see about the moving . I 'll have everything there when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . I 'll leave all the furniture for you to arrange , if you want . " Almost as soon as they moved , their luck improved . Offereda part-time cooking job in a fraternity house , Sissie went back to working half-days at the Weinsteins ' . Big Ralph was signed for one of the WPA crews and suddenly again there was singing . Willa Mae was the first to come North and then Louise followed . Big , rawboned young women , stiff and polite in the manner of Southern maidens , they immediately secured jobs with private families . How long , Sissie wondered , would it take for them to lose all their brightness ? Only Joseph Peterson remained on the farm now . Edward had gone up river to Chicago , anxious to get into the insurance or undertakingbusiness . Poppa , the girls said , would give in finally ; there was nothing left on the farm . He just stayed there out of habit . Agamemnon ? Nothing . Not a word . Whenever a family started to break up there was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But maybe he was n't dead , maybe he would appear unexpectedly , learned and wealthy , a fairy godbrother . Anyway , things were n't so bad , what with Ralph andp232Sissie both working . They even accepted the advent of anotherpregnancy , for they had managed to save a little money . She was getting along in years , Sissie reflected , but a soft squeeze of her breasts , a stroke upon the buttocks , a lingering kiss , and she forgot about caution . In bed , in the darkness , Ralph was a man . They should have expected bad luck , they were used to its presence ; but when it came again , as always , it shocked them into silence . One day the news came about Agamemnon . He had been found dead , shot , in Oklahoma . Joseph Peterson urgently needed money for his burial . How could you refuse money for a burial ? How could you only send part of it ? And because so many men needed work , Ralph was placed on rotation ; he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four . Mary Ellen was born that winter . From the beginning Little Ralph was her favorite , and she was his . He lingered to play with her in the morning ; he rushed in at lunchtime and after school so he could be with her . It almost hurt to watch the two of them , they were so close . Mary Ellen learned to recognize Little Ralph 's step on the stairs . When she heard him coming she would laugh and jostle in her high chair . With the coming of spring she walked for Little Ralph , she seemed to trust no one else . Then Mary Ellen caught pneumonia the first cold day of autumn and died two days later . Sissie did n't know who her tears were for ; herself , the baby , or the other children . Big Ralph cried at the wake as though he were bone-weary . Little Ralph hung onto the casket and kissed over and over again that cold , firm cheek . A few months later Sissie came home to discover that Big Ralph had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his work clothes ; rotation had been a farce . Then she arranged for the woman next door to watch out for the kids while she was at work . Late at night sometimes , she sat at the kitchen table slowly drinking from a half-pint bottle of whiskey . Ralph was having trouble in school . Iris was wetting the bed . Only Robbie was good . The other two made her feel like a jailer . Garlic ! What in the hell could that boy be doing sitting in school chewing garlic ? And Iris , pissing on one mattress after another . If only she were free . Free of them , the kids . Or if they were grown and on their own . Was this the meaning of her life , to have kids who did n't obey her , to work her fingers to the bone just to keep crumbs in their mouths and rags on their backs ? Big Ralph was free now , no good , shiftless . Did n't want the responsibility of a family . She had come back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home . They spoke in low voices , traversed wide circles around where she sat . She had begun to lose herself in a succession of lovers who tiptoed up the stairs late at night and left early . One day Ralph arrived home from school late ; he had been kept in and had n't put out the trash at the Weinsteins ' . Sissie 's voice rose in anger , beginning with recriminations and ending in curses . Ralph started to walk out of the room as if disdaining to have anything further to do with her . She picked up the broom . She swung it with all her strength , but his hands shot out and grabbed it in midair . He held the broom motionless between them . Sissie pulled and she panted . " Goddamn you , " she said through her teeth , " let go , goddamnyou . " The boy held on , patiently . He finally let go when he knew she would do nothing . Slowly , Sissie loweredp234the broom , and dragging it on the floor behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no longer a boy . She got up without wiping her face . The children were sitting silently in the living room ; they looked up when she entered . Sissie smiled sadly . " Well , I guess you think you 're a man now , do n't you ? " Ralph did not answer . Sissie crossed the room and stood looking down at him . Grown at fourteen , she thought , with anger , pride and sorrow . Perhaps that was what her life was all about , bringing them up to be men and women . " Ralph , " she said , " I do n't want to fight with you anymore . It 's not good for us . Fightin ' like cats and dogs around here ; it 's awful . We got to love one another more . Okay ? Okay ? " she repeated , and not waiting for an answer , bent to kiss Ralph 's cheek . As she did , his eyes stared into hers with hatred.  |p237OLIVER  HURRIED INTO THE ROOM and approached the bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , old woman , " Oliver said , taking her hand . Her graying hair lay wild and scattered on the pillow . Oliver patted her wrist and lowered it carefully to the bed . " The kids , " Sissie said slowly . " They coming ? " " Mrs. Duncan , please , " the nurse said , rising from her chair . Sissie closed her eyes and then opened them disdainfully . " You rest like she says , " Oliver said . " They 're on the way ; should be here about noon . Jones went to pick them up . " Sissie nodded slowly.  |p238Oliver  sat down . The nurse walked over to the bed and tucked in the blankets . Dr. Clayton entered , glanced at Sissie who lay with closed eyes . " Your children are on the way , Mr. Duncan ? " he asked Oliver . " ' Bout noon , " Oliver answered laconically . " You said she was rallying . " " She 's strong and she has rallied . A powerful woman . If she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oliver said . " How long 's it been ? " Dr. Clayton asked . " You mean the kids ? " Dr. Clayton nodded . " Oh , ' bout thirteen years for the girl , about six for the boy . " " That long ? " " Lost one in Korea . And two others , babies . " " She 's sure proud of those children , " Dr. Clayton said . " I was hopin ' she 'd get to see her granddaughter . You know , Ralph 's little girl . " Dr. Clayton nodded gravely . He remembered the hard days after Meharry , the pneumonia cases , the tubercular cases which had been so rampant in Harlem . Always the babies . If they got up to four or five , they lived . He had never rid himself of the feeling of sadness when the babies died never having lived ; he could not accept the idea that they were better off dead . " Mr. Duncan , " the nurse said , " why do n't you step outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From where he sat , Oliver could see Sissie 's eyes opening . " Pay them twenty dollars a day , " Sissie croaked , " and allp239they can do is keep you awake , these nurses . And the colored ones 're just as bad as the white ones . Worse sometimes . " " Hush , Mrs. Duncan , " Dr. Clayton said . Sissie closed her eyes , and once more slept . Oliver took out his pipe and walked into the corridor . As he stood in the corridor smoking , Oliver 's mind returned to that first day he had met Sissie . Ile had just finished his basic Army training and had gotten his first weekend pass and taken the bus to town . He found himself in a square , almost exactly like a hundred others he 'd seen , with an immense soldiers and sailors monument in the center . The first thing he did was ask the way to the colored section . It did n't take him long to locate a blackjack game and he spent the night gambling . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day Oliver headed for the church . A man his age did n't hang around looking for women . At church he could find a lot of good sisters . A woman and two children sat in the same pew with Oliver and after the service the woman remarked to him as they moved toward the door , " Are n't you a little old to be a soldier boy ? " Oliver smiled and said that it was n't his fault he had got caught . At the door the minister said to the woman , " Always nice to see you and your family , sister Joplin . Heard from Ralph this week ? " " Got a V-letter yesterday , reverend . " " Praise the Lord he 's alive and well . " " Amen , " Sissie said . " Take one of these fine soldiers home for some of your cooking , sister , and He will see that your son , in return , never knows hunger out there in the Pacific . "  |p240Outside  , Oliver paused to put his cap on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , laughing , " Why do n't you join me and my children for dinner ? " " It 'd be my pleasure , ma'am . " " You from Kentucky ? " " Yes 'm . " " I thought so . They raise some mighty polite people there . What 's your name ? Ca n't call you Mr. Soldier . " " Oliver Duncan . " " Mine 's Mrs. Joplin , and this 's my daughter , Iris , and this is Robbie . Ralph , my other son , he 's in the Navy overseas . " Ralph , Oliver thought . He recalled the winter evening Ralph had returned home . Ralph had walked n , seabag slung over his shoulder , carrying a ditty bag and a Japanese .29-caliber rifle . Iris had shrieked and Sissie and Robbie had risen from the table . Oliver had stood , accepting Ralph 's cold appraisal . The two men had shaken hands warmly but neverthelessOliver had sensed Ralph 's hostility . " Your mother and me , Ralph . We 're goin ' to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , yeah ? " Ralph had said , and became silent . The silence had lasted until the break-up of Ralph 's own marriage . After that somehow or other they became friends . Oliver did not like to think of those days , for his marriage to Sissie had had nothing romantic about it . They had worked like dogs , living in as maid and butler in Beverly Hills while Robbie had been taken care of by a friend . But they had saved . They had bought themselves a used Ford with a wornoutclutch . They had stopped living in and had rented their own house . Robbie had worked after school . They had kept on saving , denying themselves almost everything until thep241first trip to Yellowstone . The Ford had given out on the freeway and they had bought a Chevrolet . Oliver had taken a part time job , compelled to earn more than his wife , forever battling to stay the head of the family . The years , it seemed , had been spent speeding back and forth on the freeway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen only briefly on hectic furloughs . Oliver knew that this youngest child had been most free of whatever had tainted the other children 's spirits . Robbie who , if he were tough , did n't reveal it , was the happiest of them all . He left for the Korean War just when the family moved into a larger house . Professional servants now , a part of that vast , knowing underground of American life , Sissie and Oliver had worked their way up to the new Pontiac that was the car they had driven to Union Station to meet Robbie 's remains . It had taken Sissie a long time to get over Robbie 's death , but they had continued to prosper materially . Now they were able to purchase their own house ; Sissie walked into the new home , carrying , as she always did on such occasions , a box of salt , a cake of soap , a loaf of bread and the Bible . Only then did she feel secure ; there was land beneath her feet again ; she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , that desire to own a piece of earth . Now they began to grow fat California peonies and brilliantly colored roses ; they sheared the two banana trees regularly . Tucked behind the garage was the vegetable patch which Sissie spoke of fervently and attended with her usual energy , grunting as she pulled , raked and hoed . Out of the patch came collards , peas and beets . " Fresh from the garden , " she said proudly when there was company for dinner . Now the furniture belonged together ; the bad pieces hadp242been discarded  --  the taste was sure . In the driveway the car stood , sleek , black , big and new ; it was replaced every two years . But though the accoutrements of middle-class life had been obtained they still felt cheated  --  old age was upon them . They kept addressing themselves affectionately as " old man " and " old woman , " aware of how far they had come together . They had earned the right to live ... . Oliver looked at his watch and walked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . She pulled her sweater about her shoulders . Dr. Clayton returned , bringing another doctor . Oliver leaned forward , studying the faces of the two doctors.  | " TO THE RIGHT , " the captain of the plane was saying over the intercom , " you can just see Cleveland  --  " Ralph smiled at the too casual way Iris turned to look out the window. "  --  and in approximately  --  uh  --  a few minutes , you 'll be able to see Chicago  --  " The name of the city was like a trigger ; Ralph thought of those days at Great Lakes : Boot camp . Camp Robert Smalls . New boots and old boots . Cascara sagrada and mineral oil : black and white . The HospitalCorps School , first class of Negroes ( the Japanese snipers , they said , were wreaking havoc on Corpsmen ) . Main side , allp244snap and dash , crisp salutes . Sissie there for graduation . Proud and clinging . Watch as a gift ( broken , salted over , rusted , useless in the Russell Islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fleeing into Chi on the North Shore line , neat , dapper in razor-sharp whites to land at Fifty-fifth Street on the South Side , to break for the Parkway Ballroom by jitney or to the Pershing , the Rhumboogie ; Joe Louis introduced at the boxing matches behind the Regal Theatre . Negro USO at Forty-ninth and Wabash . ( It swung . ) Street fights , pickups , fornicating in rented jitneys , and finally the long drunken ride back to the Lakes , creeping past the guards to keep the liquor in the sock from sloshing so much ; and up early . ( God , the body could take it then ! ) Thoughts of the Navy , still triggered by Chicago , thrust his memory back to the six months of island-hopping without mail . He remembered his desperate and angry letter : " Mother , are you writing ? Is anybody writing ? " He had been in a malaria ward on Bougainville when the mail clerk had come in , dragging a half sack of mail . Ralph had gone through it eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfumed envelopes , Big Ralph 's crude writing , Sissie 's bold scrawl until , near the top of one of the letters : " Dear Mr. Censor . My boy has not got any mail now for six months . Please see that my boy gets his mail . We are all worried . Thank you . His mother , Mrs. Sissie JoplinIt had been one of the things that had made him know that love still existed.  | " My birthplace , " Iris said , nodding her head in a cocky gesture toward Chicago . " What ? " Ralph asked . " Chicago  --  " " Oh ! " he said . " Yeah , yeah . " Chicago and Uncle Edward now grown fat and pompous in the insurance business . " Gramps died there , " Ralph said , and they looked at one another thinking of the end and the beginning of things . The Navy , Ralph thought again . Chicago was already far behind them . The Navy , the goddamned cracker-assed Navy . It might have been the Navy that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not gone away ? He thought , nodding sagely , he might have turned into a rip-roaring faggot because Sissie had been that strong . But there had also been the hatred awakened by her beatings . . . . Skibbidum ! he thought , romanticizing himself into a classic situation . Why , there had been Peggy , dirty Peggy , and Lulu downstairs where the old man coming home had almost caught them one day . Naw ! I was screwing like a jackrabbit , he thought , as soon as I was able . Mostly when we lived in One Seventy-Nine . One seventy-nine . Suddenly the flat had seemed too large with Big Ralph gone , his blues no longer filling the rooms . There had been only Iris ' voice , thin and reedy . Sissie would leave the house before they went to school and would return home long after they did . She talked to them rarely , mainly to ask if they 'd been all right while she had been away . Iris had fallen asleep and snored softly . Ralph looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goings . Year in and year out she had trudged out to save carfare , carrying in her arms bags of half-eaten food , clothesp246too large or too worn for others but good enough for the Joplins . And the tarnished , bent silver which had to be straightened and cleaned so that it would look somehow as though it had always been at One Seventy-Nine ... . " Out scuffling to get those crumbs to put into our mouths and shoes for our feet and praying for something to happen so that all the space in between would somehow get taken care of . " " What 'd you say ? " Iris woke up . " Talking to myself . " " Watch it . " " ' Kay , baby . " When the Depression had finally overtaken the Weinstein Sissie had gone to cook at the sorority and fraternity houses . And he remembered Sissie laughingly telling Miss Cora how , when she was at the ZBT house , one after the other the boys had propositioned her . Even now the thought infuriatedRalph . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The years had been filled with " misters " who had come to sit in the kitchen , laughing loudly , rattling beer glasses . Ralph 's head nodded and his mind went off on another tangent . He thought of the Jehovah 's Witnesses patiently climbing the stairs on Saturday afternoons carrying their copies of Awake ! , Sissie listening impatiently to their talk . On Saturday the Watkins man came too ; old , wretched , his face seamed with dirt , he would drag himself up the stairs . Sissie abused him but he returned again and again until she gave in and purchased something , a liniment or a lemon extract . Finally death relieved him of his weary plodding through Jewtown . Old Chernik , the secondhand furniturep247man , came on Thursday nights to collect the fifty-cent payment . Sissie kept complaining that the furniture she 'd bought had been misrepresented . She 'd mutter , " Dirty old Jew-kike , " when she put on the hall light so he could find his way down the steps , and then , " I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light out a second later . But old Chernik was a wise and patient man , and when the light went out he merely sighed and waited until his eyes became accustomed to the dark . And then there was the insurance man and the milkman and the breadman , each demanding his ounce of flesh . " Do n't do that , " Iris said . " What 'd I do ? " " You hit the seat . Scared me . I thought the damned plane was coming apart . " Ralph said , " Give it time . Sorry . Go back to sleep . " He had begun to think of Ayling , standing behind his stinking chopping block , wearing his black-rimmed glasses , and that stupid straw hat and butcher 's coat . Filthy . Passing out his spoiled meat , leaning his heavy red thumbs on the goddamned scale until Sissie got hold of him one day and almost killed that peckerwood . " Do you remember  --  " he started to say , but Iris had begun to snore again , and he chuckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw hat through the sawdust and then with a more powerful kick up toward the ceiling . Then she had snatched up Ayling 's cleaver and had chased him behind the freezer . Oh , go , Sissie ! Oh , go , Mother ! Got the best meat in town after that . Iris ' head leaned gently against Ralph 's arm , interrupting his reverie . She had n't talked much about the play . He had thought she might mention the scene when the mother comes home and the children gather around her , waiting for her top248shake the snow off her coat . The mother is tired and irritable . She notices a bandage on her daughter 's leg . The mother asks : " What 's that ? " The daughter laughs and says , " I hurt it at school today . " The mother suddenly takes hold of the leg and rips off the bandage . Silence . At the spot upon the leg where the bandage was the tape has left a neat square , and nothing more . The mother throws the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . The mother asks the daughter : " What did you do that for ? " and shouts , " Do n't beg ! "  --  thrusting the child from her . Did Iris know now what it was that she wanted then ? Or had she blocked it out , as he had done with so many things he noticed he was using Bluman 's term . God , he had wanted to smash Sissie down then . Smash Mother down . Instead he had retreated , had crept slowly upstairs to the attic . To Ralph the attic and its summered corners were Thermopylae ( he had studied the Greeks that spring ) , the fortress at Nicaea ( there was an old steel engraving of a Crusade battle in the living room ) , Le Bourget Field and the elephant 's graveyard ( he never identified with the African natives ; he was always Tarzan ) . He prowled aimlessly . There was an old trunk in one corner of the attic . Each summer he squatted before the trunk and emptied its contents . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he went to the roof and climbed the main gable . Sometimes in the dead of winter when one of the coal stoves went out , Ralph would go to a corner of the attic and pry up pieces of flooringwhich he used as kindling . He did n't have the nickel for a bundle of wood and knew that Sissie would be furious if she entered a cold house . He ripped out the floorboards , notp249only for fires but in search of a treasure . Often in the summerhe pried up boards and pounded them in again with the concentration of an archeologist . His treasure trove had included a half dollar , an old newspaper , a rat 's nest , and innumerablebuttons . Only a few boards remained untouched . One afternoon Ralph , " digging " in the attic , had come across his greatest find : sonic letters hidden under a board . The letters had been carefully stacked and tied . But now the string was loose , and dust covered them . He reached down and lifted up the bundle of dried paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another : " Dear Hon , ... " And : " Dear Hon : please , please come back . I missed you so much while I was away and after I came home again . I do not care about the baby , and I 'm sorry for what I tried to do to you . I 'll just make believe the baby 's mine . You ca n't stay there all alone and work and take care of the baby too . Please come back . 1 love you It was signed thickly , " Ralph . " The next letter was written in a sweeping , curlicued style . Ralph read ; " I 'll come home next month . " The letter was signed " Sissie . " The third letter Ralph read was in a still differenthand . It said : " Darling , I wish you would n't go back , not with our child . Soon , if you have patience I will take care of you and we will be very happy . First , of course , I have to finish school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could spare some money I 'd send it , but I ca n't right now . "  |p250This  was signed " Arthur . " Ralph frowned . The next letter had no stamp , but it was sealed . Ralph debatedbut a second , then ripped it open . " Dear Arthur . I am going back to Ralph . I want to make a clean brest of everything . Iris is not your girl . She 's his . I was mad with him and wanted to get back . I did n't tell you right away because I hoped you 'd come and get us . I do n't believe you loved me at all . You just wanted to get what you could . It 's too late to tell Ralph the truth . He wo n't believe me now , and maybe I wo n't tell him at all because this is not the kind of living I thought was here when I left home and I guess I 'm still mad , but I was raised to do the right thing and my place is with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really care about me . " This letter was signed " Sissie . " There were more letters and Ralph read them slowly . When he was finished , he returned the letters and the boards to their places , and climbed through the rear window to the roof and straddle-walked the gable to the chimney . For hours he sat hunched against the column of brick , thinking ... . " Coffee , sir ? " Ralph looked up at the stewardess . " With , " he said . " And your wife ? " " My grandmother , " he said . " Black , I think . Hey , " he said to Iris , " wake up . Coffee coming . " " Umm , it 's so good to sleep , " Iris said , snuggling closer to the seat . " Did the captain say Grand Canyon ? " " Yes . " " I missed it . " The coffee came . Iris glanced at the stewardess.  | " She thought we were married , " Ralph said . " An honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " " All right . Forget it . " " I have . " " Lousy coffee . " " No , it 's not bad . " " Okay . " After a while he asked , " Did you get your nap out ? " " I guess . Hard to sleep . My mind 's on so many things . " She sipped her coffee . " First time I 've ever been across country . See America last . " " You ought to see it , " Ralph said . IIe was thinking of that network of highways moving back and forth across the nation . Where were the futuristic cars of the lightest metal and Plexiglass driven by turbines that the manufacturers had promised in his youth ? The psychogeographic Americans  --  Conestoga wagons gone , the old railways of the West , lined by the graves of Chinese , Irish and Negroes  --  still roared at the highest possible speeds from one ocean to the other , often just to be able to say that they had . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralph said . " South too ? " " No , of course not . I went once . " " What happened ? " " What I expected . But I did n't do what I thought I 'd do . I tucked my tail between my legs and drove twenty-five miles an hour until it was safe to blast , and blast I did . " " Coward . "  | " A bloody one and no shuck . Living there must be like living in a concentration camp or occupied territory . People have guts ; the spooks I mean . " " I know what you mean . " " Baby , you know , if those spooks with their paper bags and cardboard suitcases had n't come North looking for all that gold that the Irish and the Italians and all the others had come for , the North would have been hopeless for Negroes . Those people really wanted things . I hate to think of what it would 've been like if they had n't come . " Iris turned from Ralph frowning disturbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she was once again in the flat upstairs over the A &Z; Market . Iris seemed to hear the sound of Sissie 's stiff , outspread finger tips thrumming against the wall . There had also been the rhythmic creak of the bedsprings , and the muffled voice of a man . Iris remembered how she had perspired as she lay listening to the bodies thudding against the wall . She had wanted , whoever he was , to come to her too . Was it the same man each time ? When , Iris wondered , had she stopped caring and listening ... ? " May I have your cups , please ? " Iris passed her cup and cushion . " What 're you looking so evil about ? " Ralph asked . Iris smiled . " Was I ? " " Man , were you . " " Thinking . " " Sissie ? " Iris nodded . She 'd never told Ralph , who had shared the rear room with Robbie what had gone on . He might have suspected , but he never knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Iris lied , " about the Elks Mother 's Day thing she took us to . " Ralph began laughing quietly . " It was a gas , even then , I remember . " Iris started to laugh as well , thinking back to the Elks Home where the performance had taken place . " Who ran to help me when I fell ? ' " Ralph said , waiting for Iris to pick up the cue . " And who would some pretty story tell ? ' " she said smiling . " Or kiss the place to make it well ? ' " " My mother , ' " they said together , and fell to giggling in their seats . Ralph remembered how the women had looked in their white dresses and purple sashes , and the men in their best suits and fezzes , all going through the program with genteel desperation until at last it was time for the cake and punch . " She really dug those Elks meetings , " Ralph said . " Guess there was n't much else except church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly . " I think so . I think so . But the sign is n't on . Relax . " " Suddenly I ca n't . " " Try , for Christ 's sake . " " All right . " Lord , do n't let her die , Iris thought . A room . She lies still , too still . Curtains at the windows . How many windows ? The curtains , criss-cross or straight ? With blinds too , lavender ? Furniture : bed  --  naturally . Beds very big things in the family . Dressing table ? Chest ? Stool or chair ? No . Only the room in the flat above the A &Z; Market . On a corner . That room thirteen years ago . Not in that onep254now . Another . Three thousand miles away . No . Almost there . Anyway , transpose the past upon the present . Yes . The room is dark . It is clean and casually feminine . There are the odors of perfume and powder and fresh bed linens . Additional odors : pipe smoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looks sad when he smokes or maybe it is just that the pipe makes him look wise . Same thing . He is as he was . But in the room , a hospital room into which she materializes and walks to Sissie and peers down , telling her with her eyes alone that she knows . The church . Calcimined walls yellowing , stained-glass windows . An eye opened , unblinking , red . ( " Crispus Attucks . " ) Three chairs on the dais ; the bishop in the center one and a deacon on the left . Reverend Polk sits on the right . Three . Three wise men watching the procession with eyes that know the cue for grief . Below , the parishioners moving down the outside aisles to the ragged singing " Nearer My God to Thee . " The heavy musk of gardenias . The restless black line , passing in its millenium-old rhythm on the worn wooden floors , scraping , irritating . The puzzled children , frightened more by the living than the dead . She rests peacefully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her color ) , face powdered ( not her shade ) , hair neatly combed . The neat Elks Women 's Auxiliary uniform , all white , unwrinkled , the purple and gold running from hip to shoulder . Background of satin , unbelievably pure white satin . " Nearer my God to Thee , Nearer to Thee  --  e-e-e . . . . " Herself singing.  | " . . . till my restless soulshall find-d-d-dRest ! beyond the river-r-r-r-r .... " Unobtrusively , at the end of the line , the undertakers step up , heads lowered , pull up their white gloves and close the coffin . Softly . They clamp down the lid , obscuring their movements with their bodies . Apologetically . The pallbearers materialize . Elks . With their silly fezzes , tassels swinging . The Auxiliary is behind them , smoothing white dresses . The pallbearersstart out of the church , go down the steps , bumping the walls lightly , and into the street . A pause while the head undertaker opens the doors of his Cadillac hearse . The coffin is placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked . The caravan winds slowly through familiar streets , passes a boy and girl roller-skating along the same route . The caravan treads softly on its rubber . Up the hill over the plateau , out along the edges of the city . Prowling , demanding of passersbythe recognition of the inevitable . Ahead , the motorcycle policeman . Mason . Bored . Amused . Confident . Proper and dutiful . Outside , the green mounds drifting slowly to the rear . Suddenly neat groves of trees , elm , maple , chestnut , poplars , and then an ugly space of sky . Signals , winking blinkers : tink , tink , tink . . . . Juanita . And Mary Ellen . And Robbie traveling dead and perhaps in pieces ten thousand miles to lie beside them , and now Mother , Sissie. . . . tink , tink , tin --  ! Beneaththem now , gravel and dirt . A pebble pressing from beneath a tire : thung ! The metal troupe comes on , glistening . Up front , Mason has concluded his briefing with the caretaker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumps , greenp256bumps , longer than wide . Markers : Juanita Mae , Mary Ellen , Robert Joseph , small , sad , inexpensive . Great headstones , obelisks , praying angels . Vaults . Fresh flowers . Dead flowers . Filthy American flags listless in the wind of the dead . Rolling . Gravel endlessly underneath . There on the slight rise , where the earth is freshly turned and the men stand near it smoking , retreating now at the sight of the caravan , then pausing to lean on their shovels . The procession stops . The handles of the doors open in a series of clunks and clacks . People climb slowly out of the cars , into the hot sun . They move toward the new earth . Brown earth , rich , dark . Its smell is good ; its smell is definite , final . She glances at the men with the shovels . The people gather around . The casket comes . It is placed on the boards and straps . The people move nearer ; they peer into the hole . Reverend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks . People cry . Reverend Polk reaches into the mound of earth . His fingers press absently against the clod he has taken . A slow , theatrical movement . The earth returnshome , spraying from the side of the coffin . The men with shovels come up . The people move back . The straps are lowered . The casket rocks down into its place . The men with the shovels hesitate . Their hesitation is rehearsed . The first shovel slides neatly into the mound of soft earth . A curve of earth arches over and into the hole . It lands solidly upon the casket . Where the face would be . " Baby , you got to relax , " Ralph said to her , looking worried . " I 'm sorry , " she said quickly , tensely . Then , " We 're slowingdown ! " Ralph turned his head . The warning sign was not yet on . " For Christ 's sake , Iris , will you relax ! "  |p257She  sighed and touched a hand to her forehead . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She eased herself back against the seat , trying to force herself to relax . She relaxed when she thought of Time . I will write and ask him to meet me ; I 'll go back to Paris and I 'll ask him to take nee back . I 'll beg him , if I have to . She stared below into the creases of the mountains . Cold , she thought . It would be cold in Paris now . Time would be cold . He never quite got used to the chill of European houses . How silly , she thought . My sadness only makes me think of how happy I might be . She seemed to hear a mocking echo of Sissie 's voice crying out , " You 'll never amount to anything ! " How many other things had Sissie screamed in her frustration , determined to make them somehow show her ? Well , they had shown her . Only she had n't been there to sec . If only she 'd been present at Berns that night . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Ralph 's opening . Sissie had n't even given them the pleasure of being present ; it was as if none of it had counted for anything . In spite of all that she had said . Iris turned again to the window , the view of the brown , cold mountains . She thought of what her return to Barcelona would be like . Emptiness . After Barcelona , what ? Paris ? London ? Rome ? Stockholm ? Estoril ? Amsterdam ? Bonn ? The thought of all those cities , with their airfields , train depots , and hotels made her wince . All the countless men ; she did n't want them . She wanted one man  --  she wanted Time . But it was as if he were dead , as if she had killed him . Sissie had killed her man also and perhaps more than one . She thought of Time with a cable in his hand . " Mother dead . Must see you . Iris . " Ah , a cheap thought . Sissie was to begin a new life with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think it 'd be like if I came back here , Bro ? " Ralph looked at her guardedly . " What it would be like if you came back ? " She nodded . They exchanged weak smiles ; she watched him close his eyes . " The truth ? " he asked . " Yes . " He smiled again . " Okay . " He closed his eyes again and she turned to the window , waiting . Ralph heard her stifle a sigh . He listened for a moment as the giant craft hissed through the air . How to tell her ? He closed his eyes again . What right had she to ask ? Had they not come from the same place , along the same way ? Looking for roots . Gone , baby . Grown quickly and dried up ; the family tree leans in sand , sister . No earth to hold it now . Listen , you 've left behind your cold , pissy bed  --  for how many years , poor sis , did you wet the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Took me a long time to understand that , baby . Maybe you understand too now . White folks ' books , Iris . Give you beaucoup answers . In only three decades you 've gone from pissy beds to perfumed satin ones ; from one pair of runover , paper-padded shoes to a closetful of hundred-dollar shoes ; from rat-ridden rooms to penthouses and the modern castles of the Riviera ; from roller skates to Citroens . From wanting to being wanted  --  and being bored with it , I imagine . In only thirty years . And do n't you think , even in your most depressed moments  --  do they come often now , Sis , like mine ?  |  --  how lucky you are that you were not one of those five or six earlier generations . Aye , there 's the rub , Olivier would say . There 's the paradox , baby , for it is the where we are now as against where we came from so quickly , thrust forward by all those other restless generations , poor , poor bastards we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ours . Perhaps , of all , Robbie might have best bridged the gap , for she loved him . Shc knew he was the last . Some of her love for him was for us , too , Iris ; I 've thought about that a long , long time and I 'm sure of it . He could 've done it , too ; he was a wise , jolly little bastard . He could 've touched you , baby . But he came back in that box . That box , Iris , with the flag . God , can you see yourself explaining your life and work to Sissie ? Can you think about being back home with all the broads you grew up with and not feel goddamned guilty about having made it ? It makes me feel bad ; it makes me feel as though they hate the hell out of me . You can feel it : a word here , a look there , like you were  --  not a criminal  --  oh , I do n't know . Like a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's worse than being a criminal . You 'd come back and that 's a part of the way it 'd be . Unless you brought your own old man with you , there 'd be a line of jive-assed niggers from New York to San Francisco waiting to put you on their arms , willing to grace the pages , the society and gossip pages of our own press . Not because of love , but prestige . That 's a big thing with us now , baby , a horrible and painful thing . You 'd knock ' em out with your Citroen . Also you dig good books , theatre , painting  --  you know , all that shit . You 'd find us a little light ; most of us fake it around the edges ' cause you 're supposed to have a little layer of it , you dig ? Why wep260do n't have more than a little layer is because we 're still concerned with : who in the hell are we and just where do we belong . Maybe we would n't try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our press ; in the movies or on televisionor theatre . Theatre . That 's supposed to be my business now , Iris . Ai n't that a gas ! What a business , but this end 's better than being a Negro actor , I 'll tell yuh ! A star in one production and a walk-on for the next five hundred . Whew . And still they keep coming . Broad said to me once . How in the hell can they make so many movies in New York or about New York and not have a black man , woman or child in a single scene ' . . . . Are you following me , Iris ? It 's not an accident . We have to try , I guess , to be like the white folks who 're all around us . But goddammit , when we get dap in our four-button suits and make it down the avenues with attache cases , people look at us the way they look at those monkeys on the T.V. shows . Lousy shows too , honey ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots on them . They like certain kinds of colored talent . Come to think of it , you would n't fit the format . " The bulkheads 're pretty wet , are they ? " " What ? " " The bulkheads , " Iris said , frowning and smiling at the same time to make him remember what he 'd said in Barcelona . " They 're  --  " " Yeah , " he said remembering and cutting in . " Oh , yeah . I was just thinking about that . " He fell silent a moment , then said without looking at her , " Eve and I had it in the back of our minds to visit you soon . She 'd like Europe . It 'd be good for her and I want her to see it . "  | " Oh , " Iris said , thinking idly that he did n't want her to come back . She was n't angry and not even curious , really . As if to confirm her thought , he said , " There 's something so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her look as meaning , Man , if you really knew ! and said , " I do n't know about the personal bit . I do know that when you speak , you have to hesitate to get the French or the Spanish accents out of the way ; you 've trilled a few is and caught yourself . You 're not in the groove we 're in here ; you 're that much free at least . You look at me and at other Negroes as if we could give you a clue to yourself . I look at you and I think , She does n't know who she is . ' To live here is not only to know who you are but what you are . Sound like shit to you ? " Iris shrugged and wrinkled here forehead . " What do I know ? " " What do you remember ? " She turned her smile full upon him . " Being hungry ; not for food . Something that was n't there . " She chuckled . " And being wet ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd been the Weinsteins ? " She remembered Hope Weinstein , remembered wanting to be like her when they were in high school . Once she had run away when she had seen Hope coming down the street because she had on a sweater Hope had given her . She now recalled the afternoons she had worked at the Weinsteins ' in Sissie 's place . Mrs. Weinstein had given her money for her lessons , cautioning her not to say anything to her mother . She remembered old Mr. Zefner in the cellar , rubbing his coffins , pausing for breath , slurping his cold soup . " Would it have been different ? "  | " Different , yes , " he said , " but still it always costs , you know , whatever you are , to do what you 've done . " NO SMOKINGFASTEN SEAT BELTSThere was the murmur of voices and the click of seat belts being fastened . Iris looked out the window . The view almost reminded her of the Mediterranean , with its white , amarillo , pink and brown houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping below them was a plain where there stood neatly laid out , streets , walks , lawns , back yards . The plane moved , slowly , majestically over the Santa Maria Mountainsand southward past International Airport . Then the ocean , fiercely reflecting the sun , slid beneath them . Iris thought : Time , oh , Time . " You 'll do what you want , " Ralph said , " but if I were you , I would n't come back . " " Funniest thing , " she said as if she had n't been listening . " What ? " " I 've been thinking that I did n't want Mother to die , but when I imagine her , seeing her , she 's already dead . " " She might be . " Iris nodded but did not speak . She turned again to the window as the plane came out of its circle and started to float downward in a long , graceful line . Here we are , Iris was thinking . So here we are full circle . She watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rooftops spread out . It was silent in the plane . Abruptly the power roared back on . The plane shuddered . The wing near Iris shivered convulsively . The ground fell away from them . The plane nosed upward , struggling in thep263buffeting wind . The movement had been so unexpected that Iris and her brother were slammed backward into their seats , heads burrowing into the soft upholstery . Iris heard Ralph swallow hard . She did not look at him . A click which announcedthe opening of the intercom sounded sharply . " This is the captain , ladies and gentlemen . Do n't be alarmed . An unauthorized aircraft slipped in on the landing field just ahead of us . It 's all right now . We 'll be down in another five minutes . " The intercom snapped off . Ralph said , " I expected to find the pilot of another 707 right in my goddamned lap . " Almost , Doughnut , he thought soberly . Iris giggled nervously . When the power had gone on again and the plane had nosed frantically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solution : no sleeping pills , no growing old , no dull , harsh mornings . Just a plane crash . But when the plane had regained altitude she knew that she wanted to live . She giggled again . " That would 've been a bitch , " Ralph murmured , staring past her . " And when these things hit , " he said , " forget it . Do a hundred people make a community ? A whole community wiped out then , that is , if they all lived in one place . " " He 's got it made , " Iris said quietly . She also was watching . Inside the plane the whistling air outside sounded unnaturallyloud . " There , " Iris said when they were down . She looked at herself . " I 'm trembling like a leaf , " she said in surprise . " The plane . You 'll be all right , " Ralph said drawing a deep breath himself . " No ! " Iris said . " I mean no , I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something else , I do n't know . " As they passed down the aisle to the ramp , Ralph bent down and looked out . He could see Century Boulevard , with its few isolated dust-covered palm trees . He grimaced ; he hated Los Angeles . He paused on the ramp and looked back at the silver hulk of the plane . The sun glistened on its fuselage . He had never been sure that he liked such swift traveling . He distrusted placing himself in the hands of some faceless being ; it gave him a helpless feeling as though he had stumbled into the midst of a crowd and was unable to get out . Until he died , he thought soberly , he was committed , like everyone else , to getting to wherever he wanted to go as fast as he could.  |p265SISSIE  'S STUPOR HAD BEEN A COTTONY GRAY and she had driftedthrough its layers , some of them comfortable and warm so that she had wanted to pause in them , and others bitterly cold , so frigid that she had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seemed to spread her arms , like a bird , to control her downward spin from the zenith of gray , and in so doing had passed many familiar places . Sephora on a hot Mississippi day , slopping down the sides of sun-heated furrows , stinking , her ears long , dark , foreboding , like the points of spears , while the heat rose in twigged waves from the tin roof of the barn ; standing lightly in the still , blistering air , the dry , sharp smell of the chickens and their grain fermenting in sun and clew . And always un/avoidable , the heavy reek of the pigpen . Cutting across the smell , the whinny of the horses . Down , way down beyond , the creek , shallow , the bedstones white with heat , splashing weakly along its route . The fine green line of pines in the distance sharp against the reddish brown , worn earth . Her fingers briefly upon a hot damper when it has been turned just enough to trap the heat and allow in a little air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame . The drafts steady and sure through the emptied ashpan ; the skilletsheating on the opened lids . A June Sunday in church . The choir singing a hymn in ragged a cappella , the rhythm coming in the pauses , emphasis , phrasing . Through the opened window , the smell of sunscorchedgrass . The train rumbling by , its wheels mechanical , moving , rhythmic ; its great tubular body throwing off heat , water hissinginto steam upon it . The odor of the pretzel bakery on a hot day , bringing the rats and the roaches , the rats sinuous and gray , the roaches ' feet moving frantically , rhythm and nonrhythm horribly joined . The sound of her own feet crunching in the freezing snow , the snow slipping down into her boots to melt and soak the paper covering the hole in the sole of her shoe . And then across the cold face of morning , the lilt of the tags jingling upon the neck of a skinny dog skittering from garbage can to garbage can . The silent cacophony of a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweaters and jackets , not looking at her , not talking , noses running , sniffling and hawking the mucous . The masculine cadence of hard coal tumbling uponp267wood and paper flashing flame in the belly of a stove , crackingand popping . The way home through the crowds of kids on The Hill with the chimes sounding high above , deep-lunged , pulsating . Well-clothed white kids with their loose steps and naked voices and unveiled eyes ; wearing good boots in which to run and walk ; red-checked , merry in the cold . The fan belt of Car 26 running , whishing lightly around and around , the pulsating motor and the officer leaning out : " Cold , baby ? Get in . Take you to a real hot place . " Mr. Moyshe beating nails into the coffin , making sounds like the blacksmith . Mr. Moyshe taking her hand , making herstroke the coffin . " How fine ? How fine ? " and then loudly , out of the gray , the rhythm of his sanding block upon the coffin . She was screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant . Standing proudly beside her is Joseph Peterson , stern , and proud . He vanishes . Mrs. Weinsteinis also gone ; Little Ralph and Iris stand in their places . At first both stare accusingly at her , then Little Ralph swells until he explodes , but there is no sound . Iris is now distant and small ; she hums and dances and eludes Sissie 's outstretched hands , a secretive smile on her face . The voice of Big Ralph comes , bellowing to the rhythm of the guitar and bass drum , " Do the breakaway ! Do the breakaway ! " Sissie 's eyes opened . The sudden movement of white seems like snow sliding from the gable of a roof . The nurse . She turned her glance in the other direction . Oliver . Where were the kids ? she wondered . They should be here . Thank God she was still alive . With great effort she raised her hand ; the nurse moved.  | " What is she doing ? " Dr. Clayton asked , crowding close to the bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her hand , " the nurse said . " When your children come do n't talk , just listen , Mrs. Duncan , " Dr. Clayton said , " you must n't excite yourself . " " I will talk . " " Sissie , " Oliver said in soft remonstrance . Dr. Clayton leaned on the bed . " Mrs. Duncan , " he said patiently . " Please try to understand . You 're seriously ill . A woman like you who was always on the go might not understand that . But you are sick . " He paused to exchange glances with the other doctor , who said , " Go ahead . " Dr. Clayton patted Oliver 's arm then turned again to Sissie . " Yesterday we took a carotid arteriogram ; it told us about blood clots . A small one passed through the brain without damaging it . We 're now giving you anticoagulants to preventformation of clots large enough to injure you . " Sissie blinked . " Yes . " Dr. Clayton went on , touching his hand to his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heart is throwing off tissue which blocks up the arteries . The more you move , the more you excite yourself , the harder the heart pumps and the harder it works right now , the more tissue it tears off and throws . " He paused . The sudden , powerful roar of a jet plane , a different sound than that of jets whose passings he had become used to , filled the room suddenly and ominously for a second , making the window panes rattle . Dr. Clayton removed his hands from the bed . " When those clots get stuck , Mrs. Duncan , there 's trouble . Now you 've got to remainstill . " " Now tell me this , " Sissie said in a low , blurred voice.  | " Could I die just lying here not talking and not moving ? " Dr. Clayton lowered his head as if in deep thought . " Yes . " Another silence . " But , " Dr. Clayton said , " Your chances are one hundred per cent improved if you do n't upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( loin ' nothin ' ? " " Yes . " " Then I 'll sec my kids when they conk . " " Sissic , " Oliver said . " Sure wish you 'd listen to the doctor . The kids 'll understand . " In the same tone of voice Sissie said again , " But I could die anyway . " Jones did n't talk much and Ralph was glad . Jones was an old friend of Oliver 's and Ralph remembered him . Now they sped along the broad streets . Ralph stared coldly at the neat homes , the palm trees , trying to convey to his sister without speech that he disliked the city , disliked it intensely . But Sissie had liked it . And Oliver . Country-assed town , Ralph thought . Filled with crackers who had brought everything with them . And the cops oh , wow , the cops . Beat your black ass just as soon as look at you . Tell me nothing about Los Angeles cops ... . Right there , Iris was thinking , turning her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nice weather here . Kind of weather I 'd like if I lived here in America . Snow 's nice too , I guess . Jones braked suddenly and eased the car through a dip . Ralph grinned . " Forgot all about those things , " he said to Jones . Jones nodded. **25;4405;TOOLONG , ' she said . Yes "  --  here the carter paused to nod and grin  --  " so she did . She put on the maid 's garments . When the rebels burst into the palace and into that very room where she had slept , the maid stood there naked , and the Queen was gone . " " Did they think the maid was Queen ? " a young man asked . His eyes were glittering and his mouth hung loose , thinking of the scene . " She was putting on the Queen 's robes when they seized her , and she said she was the Queen . ' Take your hands from me , ' she cried , as the Queen might , and they let her dress and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank it empty of tea . Then he said , as though he did not care , " I wish I had been there when they found themselves wrong . A maid instead of Queen ! She made fools of them . " But the carter , fresh from the capital , knew everything . " They took her to the Regent himself and when he saw what they had brought him instead of the Queen he cursed and swore and had them put in prison . The maid he had strangled . " Il-han rose from his floor cushion . " I must get on my way , " he told them . " I have business . " What he did not tell even his man servant as they rode on was the fear in his own heart . The Regent knew , he must have known , that the Kim clan had served the Queen . Since she had sat on the throne beside the King , the Kim had been favored above all others , and among the Kim , he himself was the most favored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And when he , Kim Il-han , was not found in his house , would he not put to death his wife and children and his old father ? Revengeis the tyrant 's right . " We will not stop at inns , " he told the servant . " Bargain for fresh horses . We ride until we reach the capital . " The city was quiet when he entered the great south gate . Upon the streets the people came and went as though it was their purpose to reveal no change . None looked at him openly as heP101passed and if he was recognized , none spoke . His robes were worn with travel and his beard unshaven but these could only be excuses . Here he must be known . Did none dare to speak to him ? He rode without stop through the streets , less crowded than they should be , he imagined , and yet the markets were open , the fish markets and the butcheries , the pastry shops and vegetablestalls . Persimmons were still piled in the streets and the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passersby . One small boy fell before his horse and lay screaming in the dust , but he did not stop when he saw the child run away unhurt . Straight on he rode until he came to his own gate . There he dismounted and threw the reins to his servant and entered . The outer gate was open , but when he tried the gate of the house it was barred and he saw the gateman peering at him through the window in the wicket . Even then the gate did not open , and looking in from where he stood outside , Il-han saw the man runningtoward the house to tell the news of his arrival , no doubt . He waited impatiently and then the man was back again , opening the gate only enough to let him in before he put the bar through the iron bolts again . " You are home , master , thank Buddha , " the man exclaimed . " Is my family here ? " Il-han asked . " Yes  --  and your honored father with us , " the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer room was warmed but empty , and he stood listening . The house was silent . Not even a child 's voice cried . He was about to pursue his way when the doors slid back and Sunia stood there , unbelieving . One instant she stood , and then cried aloud . " Oh  --  " She was in his arms , her arms about him , and her head on his breast . They stood close for a long moment . Then she drew back and looked up at him . " You know ? " He nodded . The walls had ears in times like these . She stood tiptoe then and put her lips close to his ear.  | " She is here . " She stood back to see if he understood . He lifted his eyebrows . " She ? " " The Queen ! " For a moment he was speechless indeed . The Queen ? How dared she take refuge here in his house and risk the lives of his children ? Where were her guardsmen ? " No one knows she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tells them she is a lady from the court . She says she saw the Queen killed and she can not eat . She lies in her bed all day , weepingas if for the Queen . No one goes near her . She has the curtainsdrawn . At night I take her food . " " How long will this be believed ! " 1l-han muttered . No more could be said for by now the household had the news of his return . The young tutor came in with his elder son grown tall in these many months , and the nurse brought in the younger child , who now could walk , his two feet far apart in caution . 11-han could only hide his fears and make pretense at welcome and smiles and praise . The servants came to bow before him and to exclaim their joy at his safe return , and he was compelled to be the calm master upon whom all could rely . And not one spoke of secret fears or made report of what had taken place in the palace while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each gave some token of his thanks for faithfulness . To the servants he gave gifts of money and to his two sons he gave small jade animals that he had found in his travels and to the tutor he gave an ancient book of poetry which the abbot had given him in the mountain monastery . " Now I must bathe , " he said , " and be shaven and put on fresh garments . It is good to come home and may I never leave my house again . " So saying , he went into his own rooms and bathed , and his barber came and shaved him and washed and combed his long black hair and bound it up again into its usual coil upon his head . After this , Sunia came to him and sat by him while he ate , and his sons were brought to him again before they were put to bed.  |p103So  the evening passed until night fell and the house was still and ; tll through the hours he thought only of the Queen hidden in an inner chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken to a safer shelter . Though his servants were loyal , he believed , yet some gossip might escape one of the women washingthe family garments at the river 's edge . It would be enough for such a woman only to say , " We have a strange lady in our master 's house . She lies in bed all day and draws the curtains and she will not eat . " " Now , " he told Sunia when the house was still . " Now take inc to her . " The Queen , dressed in a common woman 's garment , sat on her floor cushion by a small table , in her hands a piece of red satin which she was embroidering . The light of two candles shone upon her quietly moving hands and she did not look up when the door slid back , until he stepped inside . " Majesty ! " The word rose to his lips and he spoke it softly . No word must reveal who she was . He stood looking at her in silence and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , the red satin a gleaming heap between them . " I am making your second son a pair of shoes , " she said . He did not reply . He came close and knelt before her on the other side of the cushion , and Sunia followed and knelt beside him . He spoke so softly that his lips moved almost without voice . " We must leave this house tonight . You are not safe and I cannotprotect you . I may not be able to protect even my family . Dress yourself warmly and put out the candles as though you were going to sleep . I will come here to fetch you and we will take horse and ride to some distant place . I have a friend in ( ; hung-jo  --  " She did not reply . For minutes she sat with her great dark eyes fixed upon him . Then she folded the square of red satin and thrust the needle through . " I shall be ready , " she said , and added not one word . Ile and Sunia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there to say in such a time , even between him and Sunia ? She prepared a bundle of warm clothing and put in some dried foods , in case they dared not stop at inns or in case snow fell and held them back in some lonely spot . She asked only one question while he changed his house robes to warmer ones . " Should you not take your servant with you ? " He hesitated . " He is a faithful creature but he has been away from his family all these moons . There are certain dangers , too , if we are discovered . " She interrupted . " I can not think of your being alone . If you were killed in ambush , who would conic back to tell me ? " Her face was quivering with suppressed weeping and his heart yielded while his will rose to make her strong . He took her hands and held then in his . " I need your courage , " the told her . " All that I have is not enough for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my duty to serve the Queen , because in her is the only hope of our country . Do you think that otherwise I could leave you  --  or defend her ? She must be kept alive , she must return , she must wile the King away again from his father . Fortunately , I hear that he loves her and leans on her . Fortunately he does not love his father . He longs to rebel against him and hates himself because he is too weak to rebel . Or so I hear . A few months , Sunia , and if I plan well , the Queen will be back and the throne secure for a while , at least . " " Why must it be you ? " she murmured , distracted . " Because she trusts me , " he said . She looked at him over her shoulder . " You had better wear your fur-lined coat , and I will fetch it , " she said . In the small cold hours of the night he went to the door of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ready with three horses outside the gate , for this much he had yielded to Sunia , but he commanded him to ask no questions , whatever he guessed . Now while Sunia slid back the doors , he stood outside the Queen 's room until Sunia came out , her handp105clasping the Queen 's hand . None spoke . The Queen was wrapped in fur-lined robes and a silk scarf was wound around her head and fell over her face like a veil . He walked ahead and she followed with Sunia while around them the house slept . Outside the gate , in the fortunate dark of the moon , the horses waited . Even the gateman slept , for the servant had opened the gate secretly , and now he stood holding the bridles of the three horses . Il-han helped the Queen to mount . Then he turned to Sunia . " Go into the house , core of my heart , " he said . " Go and sleep warmly and dream that I am home again , as surely I shall be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They clung together for an instant in the darkness and then she turned resolutely to obey him . He waited until he heard her draw the iron bar against the gate . Then he mounted his horse and they rode through the night , the hooves of the horses soundlessagainst the cobblestones because the man servant had wrapped the horses ' feet in rags . When they reached the city gate , the guard held his lantern high to see who wished to flee the city . The Queen put aside her scarf , he saw her face , and speechless he turned and drew back the iron bar . That night and for the next few days Il-han did not take the usual stone-paved highway to the city of Chung-jo . Instead he guided his horse through country roads and mountain paths , stopping not at inns when darkness fell but with some peasant family in a village . Never before had the Queen met face to face with these many whom she ruled , and Il-han found that he had not one woman to protect and hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover that a farmer 's house had but one room , the other one or two being no better than closets , and suddenly she was all Queen . " What , " she exclaimed to Il-han the first night , " am I to lie among all these stinking folk ? " " Remember you are a commoner now , on your way to visit distant relatives , and I am your brother . " She yielded at once . " I have always wanted a brother , " she said sweetly.  |p106Lucky  that he had warned her not to speak in the presence of any strangers , for her sweet voice and pure accents would have betrayed her anywhere as no common traveler . " Be shy , " he had told her , " remember that women should not speak unless spoken to by father , brother or husband . No one will suspect you if you do not speak . " Now that she was somewhat safe , the old mischief and gaiety glinted irrepressible in her eyes and smiles . He looked away . Steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet he knew that if he had not the safety of his love for Sunia she might have put him into torment . Were she no more than Queen , she would have been temptation , but she was also the most beautiful woman he had ever seen , and she used her beauty as only a Queen dares to use such a weapon , knowing that if a man makes trespass she can have his head cut off , or poison put in his food . l lc believed that she would not stoop to such evils , but he knew , too , that a man can never trust a Queen . He held her then in unfailing respect , not drawing nearer than a subject may , and this though she tempted him on purpose , as a woman will , though it was a game he would not play . " And remember , " he told her one night when she complained that she could not eat the coarse food of the country folk , " remember that these are your people and this food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see better than a bit of pork once or twice a year . And if the room they live in crowds you , and the smells are too foul for you to breathe , then remember that these are still your people and they have no palace in which to live . " " Nor have I , " she said mournfully . " You have , " he said firmly . " If you hold to your courage , you shall be in your palace again within the year . " In these ways he kept her to her best , and was heartened because she grew less willful and more steadfast as the days passed . She learned to watch the people and see how they did , instead of turning away from them , and in so doing she became more the queen and less the woman.  |p107They  reached Chung-jo on a cold winter 's night . Il-han went to his friend 's house , and knocked on the gate with the handle of his whip . His friend opened the door himself , for he was poet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is Il-han , " he told his friend . " Il-han ! Come in , come in quickly  --  " His friend 's voice was joyful , for they had once gone to school together and it had been years since they had met . Il-han gave his horse 's bridle to the servant and stepped into the gate and spoke to his friend 's ear . " I have a royal refugee with me . She must be safely hidden . I know the woman in your house will receive and hide her some-how . " The poet could not believe what he heard . Gossip from the capital had proclaimed the Queen 's death . Yet , some said , no one had found her body , nor had the rivers cast up a body that could be hers , and though the wells had been searched , they had not yielded her . True , there was a woman dead who wore royal robes , but it was found that she was not the Queen . " You are not saying  --  " his friend gasped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Let me bring her in now . She is half frozen , as we all are . She needs rest and food . " He waited for his friend to protest that he could not accept such danger as the concealment of a queen . But this poet was a true one . He revered learning and so he had stayed poor and having little to lose , he was brave . " I will tell my wife , " he said . " Meanwhile the door is open . , cad her into my house . " So saying , he went ahead and II-han helped the Queen dismountand he led her into the house . " I have chosen this hiding place for you because my friend is a good man , " he told her . " And it is well that he is poor . He will not have many people coming and going . You will be safe . But I ask that you make yourself one of the persons in this house . You are not royal here . Imagine that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was humbled by now , through her many days of hard travel . For the first time she saw how her people lived and who they were . Never again would she be so wasteful of money and jewels and fine silks . She had the heart and mind of a noblewoman , truebone and clear , and she was changed . " I will remember , " she told 11-han . He had not imagined how difficult , nevertheless , it would be to leave her there as the poet 's wife cone bowing and half dazed to receive them . Her husband had bidden her not to mention the name of the Queen and not to say Majesty and she obeyed but she was overwhelmed . " If you will conk Nvith me , " she murmured . The Queen bowed her head and then turned to implore II-han . " You will stay a day or two ? " " Not even an hour or two , " 11-han replied . " I must return at once and begin my plans for your return . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Because I will not tell you something that will be a burden on you . You are to live here quietly , helping this family as a friend might . Share the duties of this housewife  --  they have no servants . Listen to her talk , but do not talk much for yourself . Use this time for learning what it is to be a poor man with no treasure except a love of learning and of beauty . These people , too , are your subjects . " " Is this farewell ? " she asked and he saw fright in her wide eyes . " We meet again soon , " he said . He stood and watched as the poet 's wife led her away . Sud- , denly she turned and came swiftly to him again . He looked at her , questioning , but saying nothing , she reached into her bosom and then pressed something into his right hand . He looked and saw what it was . " I can not take it , " he exclaimedbeneath his breath . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which was carved her royal name . " You must , " she told him , her voice very low . " You may need to use my name in some high place to save your life  --  or mine . " P109He stood amazed while she ran back to the waiting woman , and he marveled that she put such trust in him . His heart was moved and he knew himself forever her loyal subject , yes , and more . He stayed then for a brief space with his friend while the servant fed and rested the horses . " Why should you hasten away ? " the poet urged . " It is better if there are no horses at your gate when the dawn comes , " Il-han said , " and better if I and my servant are not here in your house . A woman can be hidden more easily than a man . Ah yes  --  before I forget  --  let your wife lend her some plain clothing when she needs it . She wears all that she has . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distant relative , newly widowed , who has come to stay with you because she has no other home . " " I am still bemused , " the poet said . " It will take time for me to get back to myself . " " I shall be here again before many moons , " Il-han told him . The poet held him by the arm . " Wait  --  my wife wants to know what she eats . " " She eats anything , " Il-han said firmly , and went away . The Queen was left much alone in the lowly house of the poet . She understood that this was not enmity but reverence for her royal person . The poet 's wife was always near but speechless with awe unless the Queen encouraged her . The poet kept apart in a separate small hut where he sat upon a straw mat before a low table and read his few books and brushed his poems . Each morning he presented himself to her , bowed to ask of her welfare , and then withdrew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her mother had foretold her wanderings , for she had been born at sunrise one morning , and at the same moment a cock crowed . According to the four pillars of her destiny , the hour , the day , the month , the year in which she was born , she had lived thus far according to prophecy , a woman of willfulness she did notp110deny , but also of strength . When she thought of her own strength , she thought of the King . She had believed him to be weak , but there were times now when she was not sure . Perhaps he had hidden his true self from her . I ie was the son of a strong mother and through his childhood he had cultivated habits of secret resistance against his father , loving him and hating him , deciding what he would do but telling no one what it was until the act was complete . The return of the Regent  --  had it been perhapswith the consent of the King ? If it were only the Regent 's love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since he had eyes and cars everywhere throughout the capital ? And if he had allowed his father , the Regent , to return , was it because he hated her , his Queen , and rebelled against her as he had rebelled against his mother before her , and so because she favored the Chinese as suzerains , he had chosen his father who was against such suzerainty ? When did the King become the man ? And when did the royal family tangle become enmeshed with the troubles of the nation , and beyond that , with the decliningstrength of China and the dangerous strength of Japan made new by Meiji emperors ? She grew restless with such musings as the days passed . There could be no hope of messages from Kim Il-han . He had warned her that communication was impossible . " When it is safe for you to return , " he had said as he left her , " your palanquin will be at the gate . Step into it without asking a question . It is I who send it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then angry . Once she went to the gate , as she should not , and saw a brook tumbling out of the mountains , and beside it a wanderingcobbled country road . The poet 's house was outside the village , a cluster of grass-roofed houses belonging , she supposed , to landfolk and their families , except that out of villages came poets . Such men , four or five , gathered at the poet 's house often , and then the poet 's wife asked her to stay within the small side room . " I would beg my husband not to allow his friends to come  |p111while  you are with us , " she told the Queen , " but they are used to coming , and were he to stop them now they would put questions . " The Queen heard this with interest . She who was accustomed to command ! The poet 's wife saw her unbelieving look , and went on in haste to explain . " You do not know what poets are ! They are so willful that they dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wisdom they are already old men when they are born . What I have to endure ! I tell you , it is not easy to be married to a poet . " " All the more reason , " the Queen said , " for me to hear these poets . Leave the door open a crack  --  " At this very moment while she stood in the garden she saw the poets coming from the village . They wore their long white robes , those robes which their wives washed fresh for them every day , doubtless , as the poet 's wife did in this house , and they wore their high black horsehair hats tied under their chins , the tapering crowns making the men seem taller than they were . They walked one behind the other , the smallest and the oldest first , so that she could see each head above the other . She waited as long as she dared so that she could see their faces , and then made haste into the small room , leaving the door open a crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could sit in darkness and peer through the crack at the five men who crowded into the one room , each upon a floor cushion , the low table in the middle . Greetings were given and taken , the easy greetings of old friends , and she saw that they were contented men , though poor . Since she had been reared in the learning of ancient China , she remembered what Confucius had said : " Though I eat coarse rice and drink only water , though my bent arm is my pillow , happiness may yet be mine , for ill-gained wealth and empty honors are only floating clouds . " Yet these poets , she soon perceived , were men of mirth as well as wisdom . They were not dismayed when the poet 's wife brought them only pots of weak green tea without cakes . Sipping the tea , they encouraged one another to begin the day 's enjoymentby reciting the poems each had written since the last timep112they met , and with proper courtesy each waited on the others until the eldest took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees , he recited in a clear voice , surprisingly loud for so small and old a man , a poem about a beautiful woman who could change herself into a fox at night . When her husband , who was also a poet , went hopefully to bed with her , he woke to find the marks of tiny claws on his hands and checks , and the pillow beside him was empty . It was the youngest poet whose poem was of sorrow and death in the shadows of a pine grove . The more she listened the more the Queen perceived that the old men dreamed of youth and beauty and the young men dreamed of melancholy and doom . Most confounding to her was the fact that none of them spoke even once of the terrors of the present age , the enemies pressing from without the nation and the quarrels and the wars within . These men , both young and old , learned though they were , seemed not to know that they lived in peril of the times or that the past could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost unless they bestirred themselves to save their people . When she perceived this , it was all she could do to keep from throwing open the door and revealing herself as their Queen . To what end ? So that she could cry at them to wake their minds ! " How dare you , " she longed to cry at them , " how dare you live in these mists of dreams and poetry while I , your Queen , am in danger of my life ? Wake up , you men ! Old and young , you are all children . Must I be your mother forever ? " She forbade herself such indulgence . She must be silent for the sake of more than these , and silent she was , biting her thumbnail and forcing herself to be quiet . She must wait and still wait until some night the poet 's wife would rouse her and whisper to her , " The palanquin is at the door . " Kim Il-han was not idle although he was prudent and did not venture from his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered violence . To his father he sent word that he was not well , that his illness was not defined by the physicians andp113he felt it his duty not to come near his father until he was sure he was harmless . Daily messages passed between the two houses , nevertheless , his father 's and his own , his servant coming and going , and his father , too , was prudent , and he said he had slight disorder of the stomach and must stay inside his own gates . The old man knew , of course , that his son 's illness was not of the body . These were dangerous times for the Kim clan . Step by step , Il-han planned the restoration of the Queen . His tool in this planning was his son 's tutor . He called the young man to his private room one evening when the household lay asleep , and without daring to explain his whole purpose , he sent the young man to summon a handful of other statesmen whom he could trust . These gathered , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one today and another one tomorrow , weaving a web between their houses , and the messenger was always the tutor . " You must trust me , " II-han told him . " I am working to save us all . " " Will you restore the Queen ? " the tutor asked . " The times are changed , " he added . Il-han looked at him sharply . The face he saw was lean and young , the mouth too gentle , but the eyes were clear and demanding . " Nothing is forever , " II-han said at last . " If she returns , she too must change . " " I trust you , sir , " the young man rejoined , " so long as you know there must be change , " and taking up the letters that Il-han had given him , he went to obey . The first step was plain . The Regent must be removed . He must be taken bodily out of the country and sent to a place across the seas from whence he could not return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies . Who were his enemies ? The Chinese were his enemies and the chief of these was the Empress Tzu-hsi . Il-han would not plot to take the life of the Regent , nor would he allow others to do so , for to use such cruelty would inflame his people against the Queen . Once thep114Regent was gone , the next step would be to send the palanquin to the poet 's house and restore the Queen to her palace . From his quiet house , while the children played in the gardens and Sunia tended her flowers and directed her women , Il-han spun his web wide . He had the genius to direct without seeming to command . Thus among his fellow statesmen as he had opportunity , or made it , he put his thoughts into a question here , or he made a reflection there , a suggestion that others , following his words eagerly , took up and put into action . His friends were peaceful men , and to them , also , he knew he could not propose violent deeds . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our neighbors in the Middle Kingdom , " he said one day in conference in his own house , " are ever ready to help us . Let us now use their enmity against Japan , and make it our weapon . " It was a day in late spring when he so spoke . Outside the open doors a hunt of bees gathering among the yellow flowers of a persimmon tree told him that a hive had split . These were the wanderers seeking a new life for themselves with their queen , a symbol , perhaps , of what he sought too for his own kind . He clapped his hands for a servant and when the man came he gave a command . " Tell the gardener that bees are hiving . Let him catch that mass of bees hanging there from the branch of the persimmon tree and persuade them into a new hive so that we may have the honey . " The man obeyed and Il-han rose and drew the door shut so that the bees would not be disturbed . Then he sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said to his guests . " There is honey to be had if we snare the bees . " They laughed moderately in politeness and waited , a circle of gentlemen in white robes , their faces bland beneath the black hair coiled on their crowns . I1-han continued . " Let us invite China to strengthen her armies in our city . WithP115this new army we will silence the Japanese , now growing too strong under the Regent 's favor . " " How will the Chinese restore order among us ? " The man who asked this question was a scholar , one known to favor new ways and western learning . " They need do one thing only , " Il-han said . " And that one thing ? " " Remove the person of the Regent . Take him to China . Imprisonhim  --  not in jail , but in a house . And keep him there , perhapsforever  --  until he dies . " He allowed his calm gaze to move from one astounded face to the next . The boldness , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were silent , pondering what he had said , and he watched their faces . Doubt gave way to dawning hope and then approval . The older men thought only of the Regent removed and the house of Min returned and peace restored . The younger men thought of internal strife ended and room and time for new plans and ways . " If you approve , " Il-han said , " then nod your heads . " One after the other heads nodded . Il-han took up his cup and drank down the tea , and they all did the same . " How will you do what you propose ? " one asked when all had set their bowls down again . " A messenger will be enough , " Il-han replied . " What messenger dares to go on such a mission ? " another asked . " I know a man , " I1-han said . II-han spoke that same night to the young tutor , when all his guests were gone . " You are to leave at once for Tientsin . Here is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seal . Yes , I have the seal ! She gave it to me when we parted . Put it in the hands of our emissary in Tientsin . He is a Kim , as you well know  --  my cousin thrice removed . Let him read it and then ask how long it will be before the Chinese army can reach us . Tell him not too large an army  --  we are to be helped , not occupied ! Fourp116thousand men will be enough , or a few hundreds more to allow for death and illness . " He opened the secret drawer in his desk and took out a small bag of rough dark linen . " Here is silver , enough to take you there and bring you back . Where will you hide the letter ? " " In the coil of my hair , " the young man said . Il-han laughed . " Good ! Then you must take care that no enemy beheads you . " They parted and the next day when the tutor was missed , Il-han said only that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ginseng root to export to China . Since ginseng was valuable and the dealers in China were never satisfied , and its export was part of the business of the house of Kim , he was believed . Indeed , this ginseng root was a treasure for all physicians , for according to an ancient Chinese prescription , ginseng fortifies the nobler parts of man or woman , fixes the animal spirits , cures the palpitationscaused by sudden frights , dispels malignant vapors , and strengthens the judgment . When taken over the years , it makes the body light and active and prolongs life . " I am married to you , " Sunia said , " but you are not married to me . " The hour was past midnight . The house was silent . They were lying in their bed , in the quiet of the sleeping house . He had come into this room at the day 's end , determined to give himself wholly to his wife for the next hours . He had done what he could for his country and his Queen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's patience and tonight he needed her with all the richness and the simplicity of her being . Without words , then , he had taken her into his arms and for a while they had lain in quiet . Then the deep tide began to rise from his innermost center , and with ardor he had fulfilled himselfand her . She had first yielded and had then responded with such delicacy of understanding and such instinctive passion that he breathed a deep sigh of profound happiness . Was there ever.  |p117such  a wife , such a woman ? She asked no question , she spoke no word . Then , in the midst of his completion , she made this monstrous accusation . She was married to him , but he was not married to her ! He considered for a moment . In what manner should he reply ? Should he be angry ? Or witty ? Or laugh ? He chose to answer as though he did not believe her serious . " Shall we make an argument ? " he inquired , his voice indolent with content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her long dark hair . " There is no argument , " she told him . " I am speaking truth . " " Then anything I say must be untruth , " he countered , " sowhat shall I say ? " " Nothing . " Her voice was small and far away and she was very busy with her hair . He waited until she had finished to the end of her braid and then he took her by the braid and pulled her back gently to his shoulder . " Can it be , " he inquired , " can it really be that you are jealous of a queen ? " She hid her face against his bare flesh . " Can you imagine , " he went on most tenderly , " can you for one foolish moment dream that I could ever take a queen into my arms and hold her as I hold you , and adore her body as I adore yours ? " She began to laugh . " No , but ... " The laughter died away and she still hid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not tell me , " he said at last , " will you blame me if I say I do not know what you are talking about ? " She sat up suddenly and turned her naked back to him , a most lovely back as he observed , the spine straight , the waist soft and small , the nape delicate , the skin fair and smooth . " There is more to a woman than body , " she said . " Tell me what more , " he said , half teasing . She looked at him over her shoulder.  | " If you make fun of me , I shall not speak a word . " " I am not making fun  --  I am only waiting . " She was silent , stealing a look at him now and again over her shoulder to see if he were laughing at her . He made his face grave and he did not put out his hand to touch her . " You never loved me  --  so  --  " Here she paused for the word she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So  --  so  --  so strongly as you did tonight . You were feeling something new . Why ? " " Nothing new , " he said , " only more . Remember that for many days I have had not one moment to think of you  --  or the children . " " Something new , " she insisted . He sat up . " The wonders of a woman 's mind , " he exclaimed . " The tortuous , twisting corridors in which she loses herself  --  and the man ! Speak out , Sunia ! " hell me what you are thinking . What have I done ? Are y '  --  u trying to tell me that I am dreaming of a geisha or one of the maids ? " " No , " she said , her voice a whisper . She got to her feet and went to the wall screen and opened it . Outside the rain was falling and she felt the mist against her face . He went after her and closed the screen . " Are you mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die ? " " Perhaps I do , " she said . She sat down again on the floor cushion beside the low table and lifted the teapot from its quilted cover . She poured the hot tea in the bowl and took the bowl in both hands to warm them while she sipped . " Be sensible , " he urged . " I have neither time nor heart for complexities between us . Have I failed you as a husband ? Then I must ask forgiveness . But first I must know for what I am to be forgiven . " " It is not a question of forgiveness , " she said , looking into her tea bowl . " And perhaps you yourself do not know what is happening to you . " " What is happening to me , wise woman ? " he inquired .  |p119She  lifted her brooding eyes to meet his eyes . " You are being possessed , " she said . " The Queen is possessing you by her helplessness  --  byher high position  --  by her beauty and her power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempting to a man , but a queen ! When she comes into any room it is the Queen who enters . You are flattered , of course . But you are overwhelmed by such honor . You , singled out , set apart , by the Queen ? How can one who is only a  --  a  --  woman  --  compete with a queen ? She possesses your mind  --  yes  --  she does  --  do n't speak ! " For he had leaped to his feet , but she pushed him off . " Stay away from me , Il-han ! It is true . For a man like you , with your mind  --  oh , there are more ways of enchanting a man like you than by the body , I know it very well . And I am not clever like you , or  --  or witty or brilliant or even very intelligent beside you  --  and though you will never possess her , yet I am your possession , and you will think me a poor creature . You do so think , already ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home as a man returns from a glorious dream . And now , when it is you who have her in hiding , it is only you who know where she is  --  why , I daresay you are dreaming dreams ! " Her voice rose with anger and then broke into sadness . He was confounded . He sank back upon the bed and clasped his hands behind his head . How could he reply to so monstrous an insult ? And yet she could so penetrate by instinct that he wondered if indeed she had perceived some truth that he had not . He did think constantly of the Queen . Her person was sacredly dear to him , not as a man , he nevertheless believed , but as a symbol of the nation and the people to whom he was dedicated . Yet he was a man . And it was true that some enchantment always came into his mind when he was with the Queen . He could look at any beautiful geisha and feel no desire to look again . But when a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence , when she had a mind , then her body was illumined and he looked . He sighed and closed his eyes . He had no time for selfinvestigation . And did it matter ? He had a duty to restore thep120Queen to the throne and he would do it . And when she was on the throne she was Queen , and only Queen . " Will you listen to me ? " he said to Sunia . " Will you hear me tell you what must be done and what my duty is ? There must be unity among our people , else the great hungry nations who surround us can lick us up as a toad licks up a mouthful of ants by the flicker of its tongue . Will you hear me , Sunia ? As my wife ? " She put down the tea bowl . " I will hear you . " " I must keep my head clear , " he said . " I must listen to all factions , but I must choose , step by step , my own path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make friends with the West . We must find new allies . Yet for the moment China must come to our help against Japan so that we may restore the Queen  --  and the King  --  to the throne . " Shc was shrewd enough , this wife of his ! " Why do you falter when you speak of the King ? " she inquired now . " Put the Queen first , and then you stammer . What of the King ? " " Come here to me , " he said . " Lie down , " he said when she stood beside him . " Rest your head on the pillow by mine . " She obeyed , wondering . When her head was beside his , he turned and spoke into her ear . " I believe the King is not loyal to the Queen . It is he who helped the Regent to return to the palace . " " The Regent is his father , " she reminded him . " The Queen is the Queen , " he retorted , " and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for enough had been said so that she understood , at least in part , that it was possible for him to be possessed not by a woman , not even by a queen , but by the love of his country . In silence they lay close , without passion , but closer than passion could bring them they lay close . In the poet 's house the Queen lived through the long days and the longer nights . Summer changed to autumn and winter lin/gered . Never before had she had the chance and the time to ponder her life as a woman . Now as the hours of the day stretched endlessly long , she watched the poet and his wife as they lived through their simple round . The woman 's whole life was in the man , the wife a part of the husband , and this the Queen saw . " Are you never weary of tending this one man ? " she inquired one day when she was alone with the wife , for the poet had walked to the village to buy paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was grinding wheat meal between two stones , and she stopped and wiped the sweat from her face with the hem of her skirt . " Who would tend him if I did not , " she asked , " and what else have Ito do ? " " True , " the Queen said . " But do you never find yourself weary ? Do you not dream sometimes of another life ? " " What other life ? " the wife replied . " This is my duty , and he is my life . " The Queen persisted . " Then what do you dream of ? " The wife considered . " I dream of having enough money to buy an ox . I could drive the ox in the field instead of pulling the plow myself . And I would get him a fine white robe such as he deserves to have as a poet , instead of the patched rag he wears now . Yes , I might even buy two white robes , and certainly he needs a new hat . I mend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail of the horse our neighbor has , but it would be well for him to have a new hat . This one belonged to his father who died . He has never had a hat of his own , and his head is smaller than his father 's and the hat rests on his ears . But what can I do ? " " Ah , what indeed , " the Queen replied with sympathy . In the long night that followed inevitably upon the day , she thought about the King for the first time as her husband . Would she be happy to tend him day and night ? No , she would not . Nor would he wish her to tend him . He sent for her and she went when he commanded . That is , she went sometimes , but there were also times when she excused herself because the timep122was not her time . Then he could be angry , and insist that her woman bring him proof . If there were no proof she sent a cloth dipped in the blood of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she did not hate him , and indifferently she went to him . She was a warm woman , and lucky that she was , for the King was ardent , and without love the two of them could mate well enough . But she was slow to be pregnant , especially since now she knew that her son , the heir , would always have the mind of a child . Had she loved the father she might have cherished the child nevertheless . As it was , she sent the boy to a distant part of the palace where servants cared for him . She saw him sometimes playing in some garden , and she spoke to him kindly enough but she left him soon and knew that in truth she was childless and alone . Shc lay on her poor bed now in this poor house , and she would not weep . She admonished herself : Remember your vow ; you promised your own heart that you would not weep any more , for any cause . The long night ended and it was the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rumor crept through the nation even to the village and then to the poet . The Chinese Empress had sent an army to rescue the Queen . The poet closed the wall doors and put out the lamp on the table . In the darkness he whispered the powerful news to her listening ear . " The Imperial Chinese armies have marched into the capital ! Forty-five hundred men armed not only with good swords , but with foreign weapons ! They have overwhelmed the palace guards . They have seized the Regent himself and he is to be taken to China and held there in prison . Only the King is left . " She heard this in the early morning . The poet 's wife had wakened her and led her into the other room where the poet stood waiting . She could not suppress her trembling . " How true can this be ? " she inquired . " True enough , " he said , " so that I advise your being ready to return . " Six days the Queen waited and five restless nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently into the room where she sat embroidering . " Majesty , " she said , " the royal palanquin is at the door . " And so saying she knelt and put her forehead down on her folded hands . The Queen lifted her up then and let herself be dressed and led to the door . The time was evening , at twilight , a lucky time , for the villagers were busy with their meal , and the bearers , with their guard , had come by side roads and along the paths that pass between the fields . Moreover , a light snow fell , and this served to keep people in their houses , the doors closed . Nevertheless , when the Queen appeared the chief guardsman , after obeisance , urged her . " Majesty , I am commanded to beg you to make haste . We travel by night , and there are enemies among the mountains , in the valleys and behind rocks . " The Queen acknowledged this by a slight nod . She turned to the poet and his wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure . Yes , it was her own palanquin , her private conveyance , a gift from the King at her marriage . It was made of fine wood and the panels were lacquered in gold . Into each panel was a jeweled center of many colored stones and the windows were of Chinese glass , hand-painted . At her desire the King had ordered that at each corner there should be a Confucian cross of gold , " So that , " she had told him , " I shall be safe wherever I travel in the four corners of the world . " So indeed she had been saved and now she made a sign that the front curtain of the palanquin was to be lifted so that she could enter . And she did enter , and she sat herself down on the thick cushions covered with gold brocade and she smelled the fragrance of the rose jar which was her favorite scent wherever she was . To her it was the atmosphere of home and she breathed it in deeply . Then the curtain was lowered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the night . It was night , too , when , days later , she reached the capital . The streets were empty except for the blind . By law only thep124blind were allowed to walk abroad at night and now they walked in silence , tapping their sticks in front of them upon the cobblestones . Suddenly her mood changed . She felt alone again and cold . She was returning to the palace , but could it be the same ? And what of her serving woman , who had exchanged garments with her , hiding her Queen in her cotton skirt and jacket and taking on herself the royal robes which meant her death ? She had been killed , without doubt , and her gentle ghost would haunt the palace forever . " Has the Queen returned safely ? " It was Sunia 's first question in the morning . " She has returned , " II-han replied . Sunia was superintending the arrival of the first plum blossomssent in from the forcing house in the country . The blossoms were white and all but scentless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question she had sent the two men servants away . " You did not want to tell me ? " she inquired , busying herself with the arrangement of a branch . Plum trees in the winter , in spring the cherry blossoms , in summer the hanging clusters of the purple wisteria , in autumn the golden poplars , these were the seasons named in flowers and trees . " You were sleeping like a child , " he replied . " And you know how I dislike waking even a child . Who knows where the soul wanders in sleep ? I once saw a man wake demented because soul had left the body and could not find its way back quickly enough to the body . " She laughed . " And you tease me because I believe in the householdspirits ! " The two children entered at this moment , running away from nurse and tutor . The nurse came panting after the younger boy . She caught hold of his jacket and held him fast while Il-han watched . " It is time this younger one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Not until after the next summer , I beg you , " Sunia said . The elder son came to her side and leaned against her . He was taller by a head than he had been only a few months ago , but his willful face had not changed . The lively black eyes were still bold . Seeing that his elder brother was with the mother , the younger one approached his father while the nurse stood aside , in silence . Il-han took the child in his arms . This was a slender child , gentle as a girl , obedient , smiling as he smoothed his father 's cheek with his small warm hand . " Are you going away again ? " he asked . " Only to the palace , " II-han replied . " Why do you go to the palace ? " " Because the Queen has come back . " The elder ran to him as he spoke . " Shall you wear your court dress , Father ? " " Yes . That is why I came to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I will help you , " the child said . " I and my mother . " And soon they were busy with his court dress , difficult to wear , and Sunia advised while a man servant and two women fetched the garments and put them on II-han , standing like an image except that he groaned with impatience . Over his undergarmentsof white silk they put on him the long blue satin tunic which hung to his ankles and was tied on the right breast by a silk band . The neckband was oval and under it was fastened a collar of white cotton . A belt , rectangular in shape and protrudingin front and back , was secured by a strong cord of silk . Below his chest was fastened a plastron finely woven , and made of satin embroidered in solid gold thread . Upon the gold were two cranes in flight , embroidered in silver thread . These two cranes were the symbol of his high rank , for lesser nobles were allowed but one crane . Upon his feet were white cotton socks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after his long hair had been combed and freshly coiled , he placed his high black hat shaped like a cone with visor both front and back . At thep126sides were two winglike ears , symbol of his readiness to hear quickly the royal commands . When he was dressed and ready to leave for audience , his two sons were awestruck . They stood before him like two young acolytes before a Buddha . Sunia laughed . " Is he your father or not ? " she inquired of her sons . " He is my father , " the elder one said proudly , but the younger one wept and hid his face in his nurse 's skirts . Meanwhile the tutor had entered in search of his pupil , and Il-han dismissed them all , except Sunia . " Leave me , " he said to them . " I must clear my mind and preparemy spirit . " When they had gone , he tool : Sunia by the hand and led her to the tallest plum tree , now in snowy bloom . " Sunia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend the Queen ? " She looked at him amazed . " Are you teasing me ? " " No , I am asking you , " he said . " And if I refuse ? You would go anyway . " " I would not . " She gave her sudden ripple of laughter . " There is no man in the whole of Korea like you , " she declared . " Why do you say that ? " he asked , amazed in his turn . " Because it is true , " she replied , " and now go tell the Queen I command you to attend her . I push you out of the house , so  --  " And pretending to push him , she sent him off while she laughed . She laughed , but something stung in her heart , for still she knew the Queen had a power over him that she could not comprehend . As for Il-han , he went his way in his own palanquin , pondering upon the two women he knew best , his wife and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women of pleasure , " the accomplishedpersons , " as they were called , trained to sing and dance and converse with men . They were not indeed women so much as persons , something between man and woman , andp127apart from both . Yet besides them he had scarcely so much as seen any other woman before he was given Sunia for his wife . Ladies of birth and wealth rode hidden in covered palanquins , and as for the bareheaded women in street and field , no man looked at them unless he wished to be attacked . These common women had a fierce pride in their womanhood and their men stood by them . Only a boy or a man insane would have dared to approach them . He sighed at such thoughts and wished that he were to enter the palace of the King rather than the Queen . But to the Queen he was committed and these royal two were as far apart as the Empress of China from the Emperor of Japan . ... He perceived as soon as he had entered into the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinner , and even the fullness of her brocaded skirt and the short loose jacket did not conceal the slenderness of her body . Her face was less round and girlish than it had been and he was awed anew by her beauty , by the gentle sadness in her eyes which he had always seen lively , and by the pallor of her fair skin . She was quiet when he entered , somewhat distant as she sat upon her thronelike cushion while he stood . For the first time she did not bid him kneel or seat himself . She let him stand , keeping him at a distance for her own reasons . He made his obeisances nevertheless and gave his greetings and he waited for her to direct what he should say and thus she began : " Everything here in the palace is the same . And everything is different . " " May I inquire if your Majesty has conferred with the King ? " he asked . " We have not met , " she replied , " but I have been told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first for you to come before me so that I might learn what is the state of the nation as you see it . I know that you will speak the truth . Alas , I can say this of no other living soul . And I know , too , that I can no longer trust even myself . I am not wise enough . Who could have dreamed that I would be forced to flee from my own palace ?  |p128I  have been in a far country far away  --  very far  --  very far ... " She looked about the royal room as though she saw it for the first time . " Majesty , " he said , " I can not wholly regret that you have seen how your people live , in grass-roofed huts , with meager food . " " And yet more happy than I am here , " she put in . " The poet 's wife  --  how fortunate she is to have no greater burden than the day 's work in her small house and all for one man whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is suited to her nature , " Il-han replied . " And you know very well , Majesty , that you could never live in a small house . You are truebone , and the palace is your home , your people arc your responsibility . This is suited to your nature . " She sighed and smiled and sighed again . " You will not allow me to envy anyone or even to pity myself . Proceed ! Enlighten me ! What must I know ? " Still she did not invite him to be seated and he stood , his head bowed so that he saw only the hem of her full skirt , beneath which peeped the upturned toes of her gold satin slippers . " The Regent , " he said , " is now imprisoned in a house in a city not too near Peking . He is comfortable , but he is guarded and he can not escape . I am in communication with that great Chinese statesman  --  " " Li Hung-chang ? " she cried with some anier . " Among all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Il-han replied firmly , " He is only wise enough to see that , while China will not lose her independence , we may lose ours , for she can not protect us . For this reason , upon his advice , we must accept the newest western country as our ally . The treaty with the United States , which we have let pause , must now be ratified so that the Americans may send a representative here to the court  --  " " You tell me this  --  " " I tell you because I must . We must have a friend to takep129China 's place , for if we have not , Japan will encroach and possess us . " " Japan never ! Remember that we drove back Hideyoshi three hundred years ago ! " " Will you never forget Hideyoshi ? The Japanese are stronger than we are now . " " They were stronger then than we were but our Admiral Yi used his cunning brain and his iron turtle ships  --  " " When will you forget those turtle ships ? The Japanese have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a hermit nation of Japan as we have of our country . They have visited western countries and learned from them . And they are preparing to fight China  --  I so prophesy ! " " I can not believe that a handful of islands could dream such folly against a vast continent  --  " He interrupted her . " Majesty , I am no Christian , but the Christianshave a quaint story about a giant whom no one dared to kill until a shepherd lad with a sling let fly a pebble with such good aim that the stone sank into the giant 's forehead and ended him . Today it is not size that means strength  --  it is the youth with the pebble . Some day , Majesty , the new nations will devise a weapon no bigger than a child 's playing ball , and that weapon will destroy a continent . " " Do not tell me about Christians , " she retorted . " They are wanderers and troublemakers wherever they are . We should always put them to death . " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he agreed . " They swarm everywhere , and they carry the pebbles of revolution . But we can no longer kill them , Majesty . We must accept them , not because of their religion , but because they come from the West and they bring western learning to us . Let them come , Christian though they are . We must learn everything of them except religion . We can not go to their country , therefore we must let them come here , for our own sakes . " " If they come , " she declared , " I will not receive them . Andp130I will see to it that the King does not receive them . They must live as exiles . " He gave her a long look , and she returned it . Then she rose . " I am more weary than I thought , " she said . " You are dismissed . " And so saying , she clapped her hands and her ladies came out from the next room and led her away . He stood there irresolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think so . But he had done his duty . There remained now the King . What of the King ? Should he ask for audience ? Was it possible that his father had already been in audience ? He thought quickly , and decided that he would go to his father and see how far apart they were , father and son , before he asked audience with the King . When he arrived at his father 's house an hour later , unexpected , he was frightened to discover that his elder was ill . He was announced at the gate and his father 's chief servant himself drew back the bar and bowed before him . " Sir , " he said , " we have been looking for you . Your father was preparing to go to the King this morning , at command , but when he had taken food , he suddenly fell unconscious and we have not been able to rouse him . The doctor is here  --  " Il-han brushed the man aside strongly and strode through the gate and to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of what he might see . His father was old , and yet somehow he had never thought of death , so strong was his father 's spirit , a brave stubborn spirit , difficult and yet one to be loved . He entered the room and saw about the bed the servants weeping , and the doctor kneeling beside his father and feeling for the thirty-seven ways of the pulse . Il-han did not interrupt him . He stood waiting until the doctor rose and bowed . " Sir , " the doctor said , " your illustrious father is suffering from the fatigues of old age and drying of the blood . He needs a healingstimulant . I prescribe a brew of sanghwatung . Do not scorn it because it is cheap . There is no better restorative for chill and fatigue . Your father rose before dawn to prepare for the royalP131audience . It is no wonder that at his age he became unconscious . " Since all had long known the value of this brew , I1-han accepted the doctor 's decision , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father until the elder became conscious again , his soul returned safely into his body . As the day wore on , however , the old man did not waken . Instead his left side became rigid in paralysis and he breathed in great gasping sighs . Even though he was moved into another room for benefit of change , he did not waken or improve . I1-han became more alarmed with every hour , and at last he decided upon the extreme measure . he summoned his servant who was waiting outside in the gatehouse . " It appears to me , " he told the man , " that my father is growing worse and not better . He is not able to swallow and therefore he can not drink even the sanghwatung . You are to go now to the western doctor , that American who lives by the east gate . Invite him to come and give his opinion . " The servant was horror-struck . " Surely , master , you dare not  --  " " I dare anything if it may save my father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Il-han commanded . The man bowed and went away , and in less than an hour by the water clock the foreign doctor entered the room . He was tall and he wore black coat and trousers , and on his face he grew a thick sandy beard . He was indeed a fearful sight , for above the unnatural color of the beard he had strange blue eyes , and short hair . His eyebrows were bushy , and in the candlelight thick hair glinted even on his hands . For an instant II-han regretted what he had done . How could he trust a man whose appearance was so savage as this ? The very odor of the man was wild , a strong meaty reek , like a wolf 's musk . The man himself was calm . He bowed a short awkward bow to I1-han and then he sat down beside his patient . " What happened to this old man ? " he asked . He put the inquiry to Il-han in simple Korean such as ignorantp132people use , but Il-han was surprised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned to his servant . " Explain to this foreigner , " he commanded him . While the man obeyed , Il-han observed the man closely . Though he knew there were these persons in the city , he had never seen one close . This , then , was an American ! It was to such a breed that he and his countrymen must look for friendship ! What had they in common ? Could there be friendship between a tiger and a deer ? When the servant had finished , the man rose to his feet and addressed Il-han . " Your father is suffering from a blood clot in the brain . " Il-han was so surprised that he forgot himself and spoke directly to the man instead of through the servant , " How can you say this when you can not sec into my father 's skull ? " " l know the illness , " the man replied . " The symptoms are clear . 1 will leave you some medicine , but I must tell you that it is likely your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very near to death now . " Il-han was horrified at such speech . To mention death , to say that it must come , was almost to bring it down by force . He turned to the servant in cold anger . " Remove this foreigner . Pay him his money and take him outside the gate and draw the iron bar . " " I ask no money , " the foreigner said proudly , and lifting the small black bag he had brought with him , he took out a small bottle , set it on the low table and strode from the room with such great steps that the servant was compelled to run even to follow him . As for the bottle , Il-han threw it out the window into the pool in the garden . In the night , two hours before dawn , his father died without waking . The hour of death was exactly known , for upon his father 's mouth Il-han had placed a wisp of soft cotton . Kneeling beside the floor bed he watched the slight stirring of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant , who marked down on a ready sheet of paper the hour by the water clock . Il-han rose to his feet and covered his father 's body with a silken quilt . Then he beckoned the servant to his side . " Instruct my father 's household , " he commanded . " According to custom , there must be no wailing for an hour , so that my father 's spirit be not disturbed in its flight . Meanwhile you are to return to my own house and fetch my sons and their mother and such other persons as are needed to care for them . We will remain here until my father 's burial . " " Sir , " the servant replied , " before I obey , may I ask for the honor of inviting the illustrious soul to return ? I have ready the inner coat of cotton cloth which was prepared for this moment when your father reached his sixtieth birthday . " II-han considered this request . It was proper for a member of the household or a distant relative , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he might have refused his servant except that the man grew up in this house and had cared for Il-han himself as a child and had served him through his youth , leaving only when Il-han himself left to set up his own household after marriage . " You may do so , " he said . The man then climbed to the roof of the house and standing exactly over the place where his old master lay dead , he prepared himself for the solemn rite . The hour was dawn , and rays of the rising sun crept through the mountains in long bright shafts . The wind blew fresh and cooled by the night . It was indeed a beautiful day upon which to die . So thinking , the man lifted up the coat , and holding the collar in his left hand and the hem in his right , he faced the south and waved the coat three times . The first time he announced in a loud voice the full name of the dead nobleman . The second time he announced the nobleman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After this he cried out again , and this time to invite the departed soul to return . When all was done he came down from the roof and placed the coat over the body of thep134dead , and wailed in a loud voice again and again . Then with the help of others , he lifted the body upon a special bed which faced the south , and he placed around it a paper screen . After such announcement and invitation , the household prepared for the ceremonies due the dead . Il-han 's father had lived alone after his mother 's death many years before . In spite of loneliness he had not taken another wife , not even a young woman . His servants had cared for him , men and women , and now they set about their sorrowful work . The women put away all jewelry , and men and women let down their long hair . In the kitchen the cook boiled rice into pots of thin soup , for no rice could be cooked dry during the days of mourning . In the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft white paper and warns perfumed water . I lis hair was combed and tied loosely , not in its usual coil . ' Hie combings from the hair were brushed into the hair , and all that had been separated from the body during the long lifetime and had been saved was now restored , the nail parings , the hair droppings , and four teeth which had been extracted when they caused pain . These were put into two pouches and placed right and left beside the body so that in the next life the person could be whole as when he was born . The mouth was opened with a spoon of willow wood and into it was placed a pearl , which was held fast by three spoonfuls of gluten rice . This pearl was the death pearl , grown only in the giant clams which are found in the Naktong River , a rare pearl , pure but without luster , found in but one out of ten thousand clams and without fault , for it grows of itself within the shell . Indeed , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handed down from generation to generation . The pearl in his father 's mouth had belonged to a Kim five generations before and some day it would also be placed in I1-han 's own mouth , and after him in the mouth of his eldest son . When the ritual was finished , Il-han left the room , and the servant finished his duty by putting balls of cotton into the dead man 's ears and covering his tranquil face with a cloth of handspun linen . Now the household busied itself . New garments must be madep135for the dead , and a new mattress for his coffin , new blanket and new pillow . The men who serve the dead must be summoned and also the geomancer , whose duty it was to decide upon the place of burial , a place suited to the winds and the waters . The coffin too had to be built , and of pinewood , for the pine tree is evergreenand is a symbol of manhood . It does not wither or cast its leaves until it dies . Serpents and turtles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pine tree . Nor does the pine tree rot at the core to remain an empty shell . It dies whole , and quickly , and begins another life , and this , too , is good . The old life should not cling to the new and hamper the growth beyond . What is finished is ended and if dust is the end , then may the end come entire when it comes . The parts of this coffin were put together with wooden pegs for nails , and the cracks were filled with honey and resin , the walls and bottom lined with white cloth , and upon this bottom a mattress was laid . Inside the lid the word Heaven was brushed , and at the four corners the word Sea . Into this final home Il-han , in his position as master of mourning , now helped his father to lie and the coffin was lifted into the place of honor on a raised platform . By this hour neighbors and friends and relatives knew of the death and they came to mourn . With each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of times , and then the guests were served with wine and food . The next day at sunrise Il-han , still as master of mourning , lit the early incense and again wailed in mourning , and food was brought for the dead as though he were living . So it was again in the evening until all ceremonies were performed according to ritual . Then Il-han sat alone in the room where as a child he had studied his Confucian books with his old tutor , and while he waited for Sunia , he was aware of a new loneliness . His mother 's death had come in his early childhood and the wound had not been deep , for he was her only child and she had been ill and feeble since his birth . His father was his family in those days , and his closest friend , and there had been no estrangement betweenp136them , for the elder man had declined political posts and had retired more and more deeply into his books as the years passed . To Il-han he had often said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles for power between this man and that , the treacheries of court life , the enmities between surroundingnations . He was content to keep his own spirit pure , and he believed that he could do nothing for his fellow patriots that served them better than to remain untouched by deceit and private profit . Yet he did not judge these faults in others , nor did he change the traditions . Ile did not , for example , consider sharingthe Kim lands with the peasants who tilled it . When Il-han , in his impetuous youth , declared that his father should rectify those sins of the past whereby the Kim clan had , like other yangban clans , seized great portions of the nation 's land , his father had merely replied that each generation must take care of its own sins , and he believed that he himself had committed no sins . It was past noon of the next day when Sunia arrived with her retinue of children and servants . Il-han met her at the entrance and he saw her face was pale , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed the children to embrace their father , and he lifted them into his arms , first the elder and then the younger . Their eyes were large and frightened and he comfortedthem , saying that he was glad they had come and that their grandfather could not speak to them now , but they might run into the garden and play with the little monkey chained there to a tree , and he could come to them later . Then he returned to his room and Sunia followed . " Sunia , " he said , as soon as they were alone . " You must wait upon the Queen , announcing my father 's death . Tell her I will wait upon her myself as soon as the rites are fulfilled . " She was looking at him with tender and sorrowful eyes , but at these words her tenderness changed . " Even now you think of her first , " she said . " Because it is my duty , " he told her . " Go to her yourself , then , " she said.  |p137With  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the room which opened upon a small private garden . There in a pool no larger than a big bowl a few goldfish swam in the clear water , and the sun glinted on their ruffled fins . I1-han was suddenly seized with rage for all women . Queen and commoner alike , they thought first of themselves and of whether they were loved by men . His reason told him that he was unjust , for surely women must think of love , else how can children be born ? It is children they desire and for this they seek men 's love above all else . Yet Sunia had no cause to complain of him for lack of love or of children . So his angry heart exclaimed , and then his reason reminded him that he had been many months away from home , and since his return his mind had been much troubled , and Sunia was quick to discern that his whole self was not with her . Yet , because he feared to rouse her jealousy  --  still inexplicable to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he had not explained to her the weight upon him , now that he had seen his country whole and the people clinging to its earth and scratching its surface for their food . He turned his back on her , too , and thus they stood for minutesuntil his heart took hold again  --  yes , and his reason . Let these two meet , his wife and his Queen , this time in the palace , and let each take the measure of the other . Surely Sunia would come home to him again and know the depths of her folly . And he was stronger than Sunia , and as man should be stronger than woman he should make peace first . With such feelings and reasonings , he went to her now and put his hands on her shoulders and turned her about to face him . Her eyes filled with tears and her lips quivered as she looked up at him . " Do what I ask of you , " he said . " Go and see for yourself . She is your Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it always did , and he went on . " I left her presence in anger , Sunia , such anger that I was about to ask for immediate audience with the King . Then I thought I should come to my father first , since it was he who had accessp138to the King . When I came here , I found him  --  as you know . I cannotreturn to the Queen now , with my mind divided and my heart in sorrow . Do this for me , my wife . " She put up both her hands then and stroked his cheeks with her palms and he knew she would obey . When she went to prepare herself , he ordered his servant to precede Sunia and ask for audience with the Queen , declaring the emergency , and he ordered her palanquin to be made ready and to be hung with streamers of coarse white cotton , signifying a death in the family . When she had gone , he escorting her to the gate and seeing her into her palanquin and the curtain lowered which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's house and gathered together the head servants . When they were assembled , standing before him while he sat on the floor cushion behind the table , he gave his commands . " I have decided for reasons of state that we must hasten the burial of my honored ancestor . He would not wish to imperil the nation because of his death and our national affairs are not yet settled , although the Queen has returned to us . Therefore the burial must not be later than the ninth day after his death , for as you well know , it must then be delayed for three months . In that time it is possible that we may have war . Therefore we must arrange the funeral for the seventh day . " The servants looked at one another , stricken . They were elderly men , the four of them , long in the service of his father , and now that their master was dead they were afraid to disobey his son and heir . Yet they wished to do honor to their dead master and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the eldest said , " to show such haste as this is unworthy of your honored ancestor , our master . In common families , yes , seven days are enough to make a few worthless mourning garments . But in this house it would be unseemly . The longer the delay between death and burial , the higher the family . It is only yesterday that he  --  left us . Only today is the priest of the dead here , and at this very moment he is binding the sacred body with the seven ceremonial cords . "  |p139Il-han  interrupted him . " I trust this priest knows his business . " " He does , young master , " the servant replied . " I stood by him while he bound the cords about the shoulders , elbows , wrists and thumbs , hips , knees , calves and ankles , all in proper order . True , I had to remind him of the evil spirits that enter even into such a house as this when the master dies . Under my own eyes then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character sign , which  --  " " I know , I know , " Il-han said impatiently . The servant , because of his age , continued inexorably slowly . He remembered Il-han as a lively mischievous small boy and an impetuous youth , and though his surface was courteous , his mind continued stubborn . " As to the mourning , young master , consider what must be made . The cloth is to be bought and sewn into garments for the family , even to the eighth cousins removed , and after them for the household servants . I have written all this down  --  " " Read it to me , " Il-han demanded . The head steward beckoned to the next in rank , who took a scroll of paper from his bosom which he unrolled and read aloud in a deep loud voice . " For the chief mourners , yourself , young master , and your two sons , undergarments of coarse cotton , leggings of coarse linen , shoes of straw . On the upper body , a long coat of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hat of bamboo , a headband of coarse linen , and a face screen of coarse linen , one foot long and half as wide , upheld by two bamboo sticks . I trust , young master , that your two sons are able to hold the screens before their faces , but if not  --  " " Proceed , " Il-han said shortly . These old men were making a festival of his father 's funeral ! The man obeyed . " The ladies of the first generation will wear coarse linen and straw shoes . Their jeweled hairpins must be taken away and they will be given wooden pins . As for the next female relatives , their mourning will be the same . They need not wear hats of bamboo and shoes of straw or headbands and theirp140waist cords may be white . Distant relatives need wear only the leggings and a hempen twisted cord . But all must wear white . No colors , of course  --  even on children . " Il-han could endure no more . " In Buddha 's name , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The four old men were wounded . They fixed their eyes on the wall behind his head and waited for the chief steward to reply . " Master , " he said with dignity , " all will be ready on the fourth day after death , which is the day of putting on mourning . " " Then let the burial be on the seventh day , " Il-han commandedand he clapped his hands together to signify they were dismissed . Meanwhile , Sunia stood before the Queen . She had upon her arrival been ushered into the anteroom , and there she waited a long time , too long she felt with indignation , and she believed it was because the Queen was making an ado over her apparel and jewels and hairdress . If so , she could not blame the Queen , for when she appeared at the end of an hour or more , she was beautiful indeed . Sunia had more than once begged Il-han to tell her how the Queen looked in her royal robes , and Il-han had always refused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had replied . " I try never to look higher than her knees , and if possible no higher than the hem of her skirt . " " But you do look higher , " Sunia had insisted , teasing and serious at the same time . " Not if I can help it , " he said sturdily . " But sometimes you can not help it ? " At this he had been angry or pretended to be . " Whatever you are trying to make me say I will not say it , " he had declared . Now Sunia saw the Queen in full splendor , and it was as if it were for the first time , so changed she was by her royal robes and in her palace . The Queen entered , leaning upon the arms of two women , though she needed to lean on no one . She was notp141taller than most women are but she held her head regally . Her features were perfect and in proportion , the nose straight , the cheekbones high , the mouth delicate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her eyes large and black , their gaze direct and fearless . Her skin was white as cream , her cheeks were pink as a young girl 's , and her lips were red . She was too beautiful even for a Queen and yet Sunia was comforted , for it was a high , proud beauty , willful and passionate , of a sort that demanded a man 's service rather than won his heart . Relieved somewhat of her jealousy , she looked at the Queen with lively interest , and suddenly they were two women together . The Queen smiled . " I used to imagine you before I saw you in your house , but I was always wrong . " Sunia laughed . " What did you imagine , Majesty ? " " I thought you would be a small woman , " the Queen said , gazing at her . " Small and soft and childlike . Instead  --  we could be sisters ! " Oh , what a clever woman , Sunia said to herself , how clever to destroy the distance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And yet in spite of this self-caution , how successful the way was , for against her own judgment , which indeed was never to trust a queen , she found herself drawn to this woman . Could a queen be so without pretense as this , and yet who but a queen could be so fearlessly frank ? " Majesty , " she said , remembering . " I have come in obedience to my children 's father . He has sent me here to announce the death of his own father . " The Queen waved her two women away and came close to Sunia . " Oh no , " she breathed . " I heard the rumor and I did not believe it , thinking he would come at once to tell me , somehow  --  " " He has his duties as only son , " Sunia said . " And he asks forgiveness for sending me in his place . " The Queen came down the two steps into the waiting room and sat down beside the sparrow table , a square table of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk , whose corners were hung with streamers of silk.  | " Sit here beside me , " she commanded Sunia . " Tell me every-thing . " Sunia obeyed , except what was everything ? " Death came yesterday , suddenly , " she said . " Luckily he  --  my children 's father  --  had just entered his father 's house , and so he went at once to the bedside . Physicians were called , both our own and the western one . " " Not American ! " the Queen gasped . " I can not believe that my faithful courtier would  --  " " He wished to try everything , Majesty . And the foreigner , though he could not prevent it , foretold the death . " " He would , he would , " the Queen exclaimed , and she pulled a silk kerchief from her sleeve and wiped her eyes . " And how is he ? " she inquired . " He ? " Sunia asked innocently . " My courtier . " " My children 's father is in mourning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sunia spoke with some coolness and made as if she would rise to end the audience , but the Queen took both her hands and pulled her down again . " You shall not leave me yet , " she said . " Let us be friends . Let us be sisters . Do you know I am alone here in the palace ? I have no friend except the Queen Mother , and she is old and lives only in ancient times . So do I , too , live alone , by my wish , but I am not allowed peace . I am told by him  --  your  --  your lord  --  that everything is changed and that I must be wary and alert from day to day , and even that I must receive a new ambassador from the West  --  an American . Does he tell you all these secrets ? " " No , Majesty , " Sunia said . The Queen put her palms to her cheeks in distraction . " I wish he did , " she murmured . " I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sunia took courage . " Does not the King . . . " " Oh , say nothing of the King , " the Queen said impatiently ,  |p143and  let her hands fall . " When do we meet , he and I ? If I am summoned you may be sure it is not for communication . " She looked for a long moment at Sunia . " Do you know , " she said , " I lived for many days in the poor grass-roofed house of a poet . He and his wife , the two of them , lived there with me and they hid me . But I saw how they lived . They were friends , he and she . When I was in the small secret room where I was hid , I could hear them talking together and laughing . Such small things they talked about , as where the gray cat had hidden her kittens , or whether a certain wild bird had returned from beyond the southern seas , and whether the next day they could buy a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem he had written that day and she listened and said it was the most beautiful poem he had yet written . And at night they lay down to sleep together in the same bed  --  " She turned her head away , she pressed Sunia 's hand between both hers . " And why I tell you all this , I do not know . It is very silly . Return to your children 's father . Tell him not to hasten himself . I will wait patiently until his filial duties are finished . Tell him I will make no move meanwhile . " She rose , smiled at Sunia , released the hand she held . Then her two women came to her , and leaning upon their arms again she left the audience room . " Well ? " Il-han asked when Sunia returned . He was in the garden with his two sons , although until a short while ago he had been in the room of the dead where his father lay . He had examined the handiwork of the priest and then he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accordingto custom , when a meal was served to the household , food must also be brought here to the dead , and only when the head servant came in with the bowls on a tray had Il-han left his father to go in search of his sons . They were still in the garden with tutor and nurse , and they had made friends with the monkey , laughing over his antics and feeding him with peanuts the nurse shelled as fast as she could.  |p144Il-han  had only finished saying to the tutor that the time had come when the younger son should also be under his care , to which the tutor had replied that he felt the younger should be under the care of another than himself . " This elder son , " he was saying , " is of such a nature , so brilliant and so strong , that he rakes my whole strength . Your younger son , sir , is different , and I fear that I am not able to teach and nurture two such different  --  " At this moment Sunia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the tutor 's words hanging and went to her at once . They entered the house together and he drew the wall screens shut as he spoke . " Well , " she replied , " I have seen the Queen . " " But did you give her my message ? " " Of course I did , " she replied , " and she tells you not to make haste , but to fulfill your filial duties and she will wait patiently until your return . " " Is that all ? " She looked at him thoughtfully . What should she say ? It was not all . She could say that the Queen was even more beautiful than she had remembered , she could say that the Queen behaved to her as though they were sisters , she could say  --  she could say nothing . " That is all , " she said . Now she paused to look at him between half-closed lids . " Why do you look at me like that ? " he demanded . She smiled . " How am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me something , " he said bluntly . When she only went on smiling , he turned away from her impatiently . " It is impossible for women to stop pretending or imagining or something or other . You delight in puzzling me ! " And with that he strode out of the room . On the day before his father 's burial he went to the site of the grave , since it was his duty to be present while the grave was marked and dug . The site was outside the city wall , for it wasp145against the law for any to be buried inside the city wall of the capital . The day was warm with spring , indeed a day for life and not for death . He rode his horse ahead of his servant , who sat on a smaller horse behind him . The cherry trees were coming into blossom , their soft white and pink a mass of delicate color against the gray of the mountain rock . People were stirring from their houses , the children running about with bare arms slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun smoking their pipes , and old women crouched close to the earth , searching for the early green weeds to cook with bits of flesh or fowl and to eat with the day 's rice . The city 's most skilled geomancer had chosen the site for the grave and was waiting for him . I1-han rode across the valley and halfway up a low hill , and there in a sheltered cove open to the sun , he found the man already marking the grave . With him were the gravediggers . Il-han dismounted and after suitable greeting he examined every view and aspect and then gave permissionfor the grave to be dug . While this solemn work was in process , he stood looking out over the city , a great city , a vast huddle of the houses of the poor , the palaces of the royal family and the noble clans , these set in parks of pine and blossoming cherry . Here in the capital were the extremes of his country and his people . How long could such division continue , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize their folly ? Only the closest union inside the country could fend off foreign attack . His troubled mind searched again for answers to the question , eternal and dangerous , and he reviewed the dangers . He heaved a sigh as deep as his soul and was glad that his father was dead . Yet of what use was death ? His two sons were alive and must meet the future he dreaded , and how could he help them except by somehow preserving for them their country , whole and independent ? " Sir , " the geomancer said . " Will you approve ? " He turned and walked toward the grave and looked into it . The earth was scanty , and rocks had been heaved out of it to make the pit and piled until the grave was rimmed with suchP146rocks . To one side were the two gravestones upon which were already carved the high qualities of his father as poet and patriot , one to be buried at the foot of the grave and the other to be set up for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I1-han told the geomancer . There remained now only to wait for the mourners who were to bring food offerings to the spirit of the mountain , who was now to receive the body of his father , and 11-han waited until he saw the procession coming on foot from among the rocks . The bowls of food were then set forth in proper arrangement and the rites were concluded . There remained but one more duty , and it was to declare to his dead father that the grave was ready for his body , which he did as soon as he returned to his father 's house . In the presence of his father 's dead body he made declaration . On the morning of the seventh day , his servant reported to Il-han that the shelters had been built near the grave , the funeral bier was made , and this because the family was too high to use a rented bier , the banners were complete , and all was ready for the funeral . To this Il-han made no answer except to incline his head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during these days , and alone he had returned to the library of his father 's house , dressed every day in mourning and eating only a little coarse food , while he studied the Buddhist scriptures and the Confucian classics in order that his soul and mind might be purified . He had so continued thus throughout the days until the hour came for the funeral procession to assemble . In the late afternoon of this seventh day all gathered together in readiness to proceed to the mountain . Twilight was near , the suitable time between day and night when his father 's spirit would not be disturbed . In his place as the son and master of mourning , Il-han viewed the procession as it formed . He was content with what had been done . The procession then set forth . At its head were the torchmen , who held great torches made of brushwood branches bound together . These were lighted and were dragged along the ground , firing as they went a trail ofp147lively sparks . Now and again the men lifted the torches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them again to the earth . Next came the lantern bearers in two lines , carrying lanterns of ironwork covered with the best silk in red and blue colors , and after those came a banner bearer on foot , carrying in both hands a banner of silk on which was written the name of the illustrious dead and the many honors he had accumulated in his lifetime . In the center of the procession was the shrine , carried by bearers , and in the shrine , which was made of the finest wood , carved in detail , was set the spirit tablet . On both sides and following the shrine were the women mourners , and after them other lantern bearers whose duty it was to illuminate the catafalqueitself , borne by a host of bearers chanting a mournful tune to keep their feet in step . Since the dead had been a man of honor and wealth , a bell ringer walked in front , ringing his bell as he went , and around the catafalque on all sides were banner bearers carrying the banners sent by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catafalque Il-han rode in a sedan chair carried by bearers , and behind him in other chairs were Sunia and his sons and the lesser relatives and mourners . Slowly the long procession went its way through the streets , the people stopping to stare and to follow , and thus they approached the Water Mouth Gate , which was the gate for the dead . The first darkness had fallen when at last they reached the mountain and there they stopped for the night in the shelters that had been raised for this purpose . They slept in rude beds , but Il-han could not sleep . He lay down and got up again , many times , and at last he walked outside in the cold night air . The moon shone so clear that the whole world seemed to lie before him , as still in sleep as the dead . Though it is in the course of nature that a son live longer than his father , yet a deep and solemn mood fell upon him as he realized that from now on , until he himself lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct of affairs inside his house and beyond its walls to the nation and even beyond to thep148world . An age had ended with his father , an age when his nation had chosen to be hermit , seeking only to hide itself from the surrounding nations and so to live in peace . Yet there could be no peace now , when foreign ships were sailing toward them across foreign seas , and quarrel rising between a new and young Japan and an old and dying dynasty in China . And what of the giant toward the north ? He turned himself to the north , and there above the sharp and pointed peak of the mountain , above that solid rock , he saw the northern star , at this moment as red as blood . In the morning , Il-han roused the procession and they went on and upward to the site . All was ready there , and with due ceremonythe coffin was placed upon transverse poles and covered with a wide length of white cloth , while the geomancer stood near , a compass in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there been more sons , these sons would have lowered the coffin , but since there was only Il-han , others helped him at the task . The empty grave , cleansed of all evil vapors and plaguing spirits , now received its owner , while incense burned and women faced the east and the mourners wailed their formal wails of sorrow . Now Il-han , with the help of the men , slowly filled the grave with earth . Deeply as he had felt his father 's death , this was the moment of most acute sorrow . The clods fell upon the coffin with sad dull thuds and he heard his sons scream in fear . Yet he did not turn his head nor speak to comfort them until the task was done . Then he stood on the first terrace below the grave , and facing it in his clear strong voice he announced to the spirit of the mountain that the dead was now buried in its rock and soil . For a moment he stood , carving into his memory the scene he surveyed . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain , on a leveled place , the dug earth raised about it in a bank so that the grave itself lay in the hollow of a crescent . Here at its foot the earth was terraced down to the slope of the mountain and here he stood , saying in his heart the long farewell to his father . There remained but one more task and it was top149appoint a caretaker for the grave . For this he summoned the chief steward , who accepted the charge with a deep bow and folded hands . Thus the day ended and with his family and his retinue Il-han returned to his own house . When the days of this mourning were over , Il-han asked audienceof the King and not the Queen . During the long quiet hours of isolation which respect for his father demanded , he had consideredcarefully his duty . Without the title or high office desired neither by his father nor himself , independent as they had always been in wealth and family , he could refuse the obligationsof position , and yet he had the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So long as his father lived , he had not presumed to approach the King and he maintained his access to the Queen . Now , however , he had by death come into his father 's place , and it was fitting that he should first approach the King . He made known his wish by courier , and the King set an appointed time for private audience . It was at dawn on the seventh day of the seventh month of that moon year . The season was summer . At the set hour Il-han entered his palanquin and was borne to the palace , his servant riding on horse before him to announce his arrival at the gates . King Kojong , the twenty-sixth monarch of the dynasty of Yi , was still in the prime of his manhood . His mother , Queen Cho , and his father , the Regent , Tae-wen-gun , were early separated in spirit and mind and fact , and he had grown up in the vacuum which existed between them . Each was strong , his father with a male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had been played upon by both and had therefore grown slowly to maturity . There were times when he still struggledagainst these conflicting influences , to which had been added a third , his marriage to a beautiful girl of the powerful house of Min . His secret taste in women was for small soft yielding childlikep150females . Instead he was tied to a strong willful woman who seemed never to have been a child . Yet she fascinated him , that part of him which was still boy , the boy whom he tried so constantly to ignore , to destroy , to eliminate from himself , and who he yet feared was his essential being . There was no one to whom he could talk about himself . For while there were the conflicts in him , these secret influences dividing him and distracting him , he understood very well that he was at the mercy also of the conflicts outside him . He was not an ignorant king . As a child he had been schooled in Confucianism and Buddhism , and in the history of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father , the Regent , had but one purpose , which was to close the country and make it a hermit nation . Alas , he , the son and present King , knew that this was no longer possible . Incredible as it seemed , the persistent weapon of the Vest had been religion , a religion based , his father had taught him , upon superstition first proclaimed by a small local group of persons who called themselves Jews , who had killed a revolutionary among their own people , one named Jesus . The human race was always in turmoil from these revolutionaries , his father had maintained , and the Koreans had no need of importing foreign ones when they had plenty of their own . With this excuse , his father had approved the murder of all foreign priests who continued to penetrate into the country , in spite of doom . Now his father , the Regent , was imprisoned in China , and he , the King , could decide for himself what must be done . Certainly he must come to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to China , refusing to realize that Japan was in the ascendency . They had quarreled over this matter only the night before . He had sent for her , an unusual circumstance , for they had long remained apart . Yet when she returned from her flight she had , he thought , changed for the better . She had come before him formally upon her arrival , and he found her gentler than she had been since their son was found to be of weak mind . She was still beautiful , and he thought he could detect in her manner some slight wish , or longing , or per/haps only the inclination of desire in a woman who knows her youth is nearly gone . Therefore he had invited her to dine with him alone last night , with the thought that if her charm held , they might renew something of the past and she might conceive a son while there was yet time . He had subdued her more than once in the years when their passion had been strong , and it amazed him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless been spoiled . They had fallen into the old argument , and had parted early with formal bows and with mutual impatience , and after she was gone he had sent for a palace lady of pleasure . Now , the morning after , he heard the announcement that the son of his old friend and recently dead adviser waited for audience , and was ready to step into his father 's place . He knew Kim Il-han to be an adviser to the Queen , and he did not hurry himself . Let the man wait ! It was fully two hours before he sent his chief chamberlain to the Hall of Waiting to say audience was granted . The delay would calm his subject 's possible arrogance , he told himself , and then , to mitigate or merely to confuse , he would himself be informal and friendly upon meeting . At high noon he strode into the audience hall and seated himselfupon the throne , which here was scarcely more than an ornate chair , set low to the floor so that he could draw up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down and crossed his knees in the western fashion . He had never seen a white man , but he was told that they sat on seats and let their legs hang or crossed their knees and he knew that subjects observed every detail of a monarch 's behavior , anxious to catch any straw in any wind . Il-han entered now and knelt before the King . He placed his hands together flat on the polished floor , thumb to thumb . Then he bent his head until his forehead touched his hands and waited . " You may stand , " the King said pleasantly . Il-han stood , his eyes on the floor , and again he waited . " You may speak , " the King said in the same kind voice . Without raising his eyes , Il-han then spoke . " Majesty , I comep152as the son of my father , now deceased . I come , as he did , only as a private citizen , but as one responsible , with others , for the people , and therefore ready for service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture of the hand that Il-han was to seat himself on the floor cushion before the throne . " Let us forget ceremony , " the King said when the ceremonies were finished . " I trust you because you are your father 's son . He was a wise man . He told me once that the three nations who surround us are like the balls a juggler must keep in the air and in motion , and we must be the juggler . Do you agree ? " " Majesty , I would even add more such balls , " Il-han replied . " The western nations are eying us across the four seas . How many halls there will be for us to juggle , I can not tell . But there will be more than three , and some may have to be cast aside . " The King uncrossed his legs impatiently and crossed them again . I le did not wear his garments of state today , but about his neck was a heavy chain of jade pieces strung on gold . At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cranes under a pine tree , and with this emblem his right hand was now busy . He had a full underlip , a sign of his passionate nature , and he pinched it now between thumb and finger , in deep thought . " Will you accept office ? " he asked at last . " Will you be , let us say , prime minister ? Chancellor ? What you will  --  " I1-han raised his eyes to meet the royal gaze and was startled by the boldness he saw . The King 's eyes were narrow , the cornerssharp and the pupils very black under wide short black brows . They were not the eyes of a poet or a thinker but of a man accustomed to act . His hand , fingering the full lower lip , was dark and strong . " Majesty , " Il-han said , while he let his eyes fall again to the embroidered cranes and the pine tree on the King 's breast , " forgive me if I decline office . I wait for your command , day and night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall not be free to speak , to move , to report , to observe , to ask for audience ,  |p153to  be of use to you , I hope , as your own hand is useful , obedient to your brain and heart . " The King laughed . " What you mean is that you prefer not to owe me anything ! Well , that is rare enough . " He clapped his hands and servants entered . " Bring us food and drink , " he commanded . While the servants obeyed , he went on , " Now , let us discuss the position of this jewel you call our country . I do not deceive myself as to why Li Hung-chang wishes us to receive an envoy from the United States . It is his weapon against Japan , who threatens war . In such a war we would be their point of departurefor China . Tell me , what is the United States ? " He put the question suddenly to Il-han , who was embarrassed because he did not know the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recollect that the sailors shipwrecked on our shores some fifteen years ago were Americansand I have heard that they were very savage . They molested our women , and our people , outraged , put them to death . " " Not immediately , " the King reminded him . " The sailors were at first only arrested . Then others came out from ships to rescue them , and these men seized their shipmates from us , and with them certain of our men , as hostages . It was only then that our outraged people attacked the ship , killed eight of the Americans , and captured the others and burned the ship  --  all of this deserved , I was told . " Here the King paused and thought awhile and II-han was amazed to hear such detail . " Perhaps the truth does not matter now , " the King said at last , " but I may as well tell it to you . It was my father who commanded that the ship be attacked . He feared that it brought more Catholic priests to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in earlier years . My father believes , has always believed , that western religions disturb the peace wherever they go . This he has observed from such foreign persons in China and in Japan and while he ruled he forbade all foreign priests to set foot on our shores , and if they did so secretly he had them killed.  |p154Alas  , some of our own people have been beguiled by them , and have themselves become Christian . I will not speak of this . " Here he paused , and Il-han knew the King was reminded of that Kim ancestor of Il-han 's who had been killed because he was Catholic . " I have followed my father , " the King continued . " While I was very young I refused to see the American , surnamed Low , who arrived in our port with a fleet of ships . But today I do not know .... " The servants brought the food now and set it on the table and stood by to serve . But the King sent them away again . " They stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were gone , " but they are not images . Their eyes see , their ears hear , and their tongues carry talcs . Proceed ! " " Majesty , I am honored that you tell me your thoughts . I am your subject and I ought only to listen and not to speak . " " Speak , " the King commanded . " I am surrounded by men who will not speak . Sometimes I think everyone in the palace has cut out his tongue except the Queen . She has no fears ! I daresay if Buddha himself were reincarnated here she would tell him how to behave and what to think . " The King spoke willfully , aware that this was no fit talk between himself and a subject and he enjoyed it the more for that reason . Il-han made a small smile and did not reply . Instead he went on thus : " Majesty , your father , the Regent , has done what he believed right in his time . For example , he resisted the Japanese as stoutly as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed at times to devise insults for them , hoping they would leave our shores . They did not leave . I beg you , Majesty , not to follow your father . I beg you to think for yourself , to decide for yourself what must be done to preserve our nation and our people . Of all the western peoples , the Americans seem the least vicious . They are young , they have no experience , and they know what it is to fight for independence for themselves . I have heard that overp155a hundred years ago they fought the country that ruled them , and won . " " What are you saying ? " the King demanded . " I am saying that we must accept the Americans , as Li Hungchangadvises , " Il-han replied . The King clenched his fists and pounded the table so that the dishes jumped . " By a treaty which takes still more from us ! " he shouted . " By a treaty , " Il-han agreed . The two men looked straight into each other 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet . " I can eat nothing , " he declared , and he turned his back on Il-han and strode from the room . How then could Il-han eat ? He also rose , and putting on his outer garment , he went away . The servants saw him go and came into the empty room . The dishes of delicacies had not even been uncovered , and the servants took them to the kitchens and there with great relish and high laughter they ate the meats prepared for the King . In the night , when Il-han returned from the long conference with the King , he told Sunia that he had been offered a high post in government and that he had declined . Ile did not regret his refusal , yet he wondered if she , perhaps , being more simple than he by nature , or so he imagined , might secretly envy other women whose husbands were publicly known . I is had a certain fame as a scholar , a thinker , one who did not fear to do what he liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this enough ? When she replied , he perceived that he had been wrong , and again he marveled , as he had often before , how it is that a man can live with a woman and have sons by her and still know very little of what she is . For Sunia spoke at once when he finished what he had to tell . " You did very well to refuse a post , " she said . It was night and they lay on the floor mattresses . A candle burned on the low table at his side . The house was silent andp156beyond the drawn screens the night was dark . He had talked for a long time , and she had listened . " Why do you say so ? " he asked now . " For one reason , " she said . " You always forget small things . You are a great man , but only in great things . You speak to kings and queens as though you were their brother , but you do not know one servant in this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder sometimes if you would even know your sons , if you saw them in a crowd of children . Now you will have time to know your sons  --  and me , too , I daresay ! " She broke off to laugh , and she had ready laughter , but he was surprised at what she had said . " You describe a very foolish fellow , " he complained , " and I think I am better than that . " She turned on her side then and leaned her head on her elbow and looked down into his rebellious face . " You are only foolish , I say , in small things . If you were clever in small ways you would be foolish in great ones and I am satisfied with what you are . More than that , I know very well that I am a fortunate woman , a lucky wife , a blessed mother . " " Now , now , " he said , laughing in turn . " You blame yourself too much . A woman gets what she deserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he aroused by the sight of the lovely face so near , her eyes lustrous and dark in the candlelight . In this way he knew her very well , for when she was ready a peculiar fragrance came from her body . He had learned , but not easily , that while without this fragrance she could submit , it was without response , and then he was robbed of half his joy . While he was a bridegroom , a husband too young , he had not been able to restrain his passion , or suit its timing to hers , even though he cursed himself because , if he did not , they were further apart afterward . But with the fullness of manhood he learned , and he was rewarded . Better to have her whole , at her own time , than resisting when she was not . Now her fragrance came sweet and strong , and he held her P157long and close . When they drew apart , they were closer than ever before , and they lay in peace and silence , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour or so and was thirsty and she poured a bowl of tea and then came out with what she had been thinking . " While we are in mourning , you can do nothing outside , and you must promise me to learn the difference between our two sons . I feel each is different from the other , each not ordinary , but I have not the wit to know what the difference is . This is the first thing I have to say . " He drank the tea and held his bowl for more . " Then there is a second ? And a third , doubtless ! When a man has a little time to be idle , be sure his wife will fill it for him . " She pretended to snatch the bowl away from him . " Dare to think I am like other wives ! " " Fortunately you are not . " He was suddenly wide awake , relaxed , amused , and wondering whether , if he indulged her , her fragrance would flow again . She had changed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of clean freshness . " You are to stop thinking your own private thoughts , " she retorted . " You are to listen to me , if you please ! I1-han , I say you should know some of these Americans before you advise the King again . You are in a high , responsible place . You advise rulers . Yet how do you know if Americans arc good or evil ? What if you lead the King into wrongdoing and our people suffer because you know too little of what you arc talking about ? " This was the surprising woman . While he could have sworn she had no concern for anything beyond her household , she came forward with this simple wise conclusion . Unpleasant though it was to consider consorting with foreigners , what she had said was true . Chinese he knew , and Japanese , and a few Russians , but he knew almost no Americans . All inclination for renewed lovemaking ebbed out of him . " Go to sleep , " he told Sunia . " You have said enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many nights to come . " And he pinched out the flame of the candle between his thumb and forefinger . In these days of mourning for the one dead , Il-han devoted himself to the living . Each morning he sat near while the tutor taught his elder son and he was pleased by the boy 's quickness where he was interested and then displeased because where he had no interest he idled . Nevertheless he did not interfere and as the days passed he saw that the tutor understood the child well , and when the child looked away from his books he did not reproach him . Instead he bade the boy run in the garden or he gave him a brush and colored inks and let him paint a picture . " In a picture , " he told Il-han privately , " I discover the child 's hidden thoughts and feelings . " " What does he paint ? " Il-han asked . The tutor was troubled . " He paints violence , " he said at last . " In this gentle and noble household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth , or a devil peering out from the bamboos , or a hawk with a mouse bleeding in its claws . " Il-han heard this with surprise . " No one has ever treated this child harshly . Why should he have such thoughts ? " " I surmise that it comes from the times in which we live , " the tutor replied . " He hears of robbers in the city and of bandits in the mountains and he has asked me many times why the Queen was all but murdered , and he is aware of the quarrels among the noble clans . When he is in the country at your honored father 's house , as he has always wished to be in the summer , he makes friends with the sons of the farmers who till your lands , sir , and they are wild children . I try to keep him away from them , but he escapes me and I find him there in the village , his good clothes torn and dusty , and his face and hands as black as theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he uses coarse language that he has heard them use . Indeed , he has told me more thanp159once that he wishes he were the son of a peasant , so that he could be free to run the streets and do what he likes . " This was grave news , and Il-han was pricked by his conscience . While he had been concerned with the Queen and the King , his son had found companionship among the ignorant and the poor . That very day , when the morning 's lessons were over and the noon meal eaten , he took his elder son by the hand and led him toward the bamboo grove . " Let us see whether the young shoots are ready to break through again , " he coaxed . The season was too early , he feared , but no , when they came into the shadows of the grove , the bamboos so thick together that the sunlight fell through in drops of light , they saw the earth was loosened by the uprising shoots . Here and there a pointed sheath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth . " Do you remember , " Il-han asked his son , " how once you broke the shoots and killed the trees ? " " You said they were only reeds  --  not trees . " The boy spoke willfully , but Il-han could see that he did remember . Still holding the boy 's hand he explained what he had said before . " You were too small to understand what I told you . Although they were only hollow reeds they were living , and they spring anew from old roots . I said that in our country the bamboo shoot is the symbol of the strong uprising spirit of a man . Perhaps the man is a great poet , or an artist , or perhaps he is a leader among the people , even a revolutionist . It is easy to crush these bamboo shoots . You could do it even when you were very small . It is easy to destroy but hard to create . Remember that , when you want to destroy something . " The boy was struggling to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go until he had finished what he wanted to say . Now he loosed him and the boy , as soon as he felt himself free , ran swiftly away . Il-han looked after the flying slender figure , and was deeply troubled . From then on he kept watch of this son , and when he saw him push his younger brother ,  |p160or  tear down what the younger son had built of stones or small blocks of wood , he took the elder firmly by the hands and held his hands behind his back and reminded him again and again . " It is easy to destroy , but it is hard to create . Do not destroy what your brother creates . " Sunia observed this one day . " It is not enough merely not to destroy , " she said . " Why not help him to create something himself ? " Again she had said something to stir his mind , and Il-han thought of his ancestor Chong-ho , surnamed Kim , who was the first mapmaker . This ancestor , as a boy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . 1 le had wandered over mountainsand beside rivers , and he began to wonder where the rivers had their sources , and how the mountains lay , and what the shape was of the winding coastlines , and how many islands were beyond . Il-han told his elder son one day of the mapmaker . " This ancestor of ours asked everyone where he could find a map of our country which would tell him all these things . There was no such map . He promised himself then that he would be a mapmaker when he grew up , and he studied every map he could find , traveling here and there to see whether the maps were true . They were not true . Mountains and rivers were in confusionand the shorelines were straight where they should be curved into bays and coves , and the sources of the rivers were only imagined . When he was a man he came here to Seoul and asked the rulers to help him , but no one cared for maps or knew their usefulness . He was discouraged but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , measuring and drawing picturesand writing down what he found , until he had made the first complete map of Korea . Then it had to be printed . Still no one helped him and he worked and saved and bought blocks of wood and carved the shape of the map upon them . He inked these blocks and stamped them on paper and there was the map ! Alas , the King in those times only thought that our ancestor was helping some enemy , and he had the maps burned withp161the blocks of wood . But our ancestor had memorized the map , and then the King decided that he should be killed . The boy listened to this , and his face turned pale . " How did they kill him ? " " Does it matter ? " Il-han replied . " I want to know , " the boy insisted . " They cut off his head , " Il-han said shortly . The boy thought for a moment . Then he said in a cool voice , as though without interest , " There must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Il-han answered , " but that is not important . I tell the story because I want you to know of our ancestor , and how brave he was to create something so good and useful as a map , and how foolish it was to destroy him . Even the King was ignorant . " He did not know whether his son heard him . He thought he had not , for he felt the child 's hand on the back of his neck . " What now ? " Il-han inquired , and pulled the young hand away from his neck . " The bone , " his son said , his great eyes staring and dark . " They must have used a saw to cut the bone . " At this Il-han pushed the child 's hand aside and went away . But in the night he woke suddenly and fully heard in the distancethe sound of the night watchman in the street , on guardagainst fires . Among the huts of the poor a fire burning in themiddle of a room could set a thatched roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faulty flue or rubbish thrown out bya careless servant could destroy the city . All night the fire guardwalked the streets , striking his two bamboo sticks together sothat folk , waking , would know that he was watching over theirsafety . Il-han listened to the man come nearer , until the clackclackwas loud and clear and then it faded again into the distance . It was not this sound that had waked him , for he slept throughit every night of his life . No , he was waked by a deep worryinside his mind and his heart , a worry he had set aside in theday , and which now rose up in the darkness of the night . Fromthis time on , he swore to himself , he would spend some partP162of every day with his elder son . For he could not forget the hand feeling the bone in his neck , the small cold hand . ... The younger son was another creature . This child could not bear to crush a fly or pull a cat 's tail . It was Il-han 's habit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took no great notice . Indeed the first notice he gave to this second son , beyond the worry of his shortened ear , was on his first birthday , one of the three highest days in a man 's life , the second being his wedding day and the third his sixtieth birthday . True , he could never forget that this baby son had looked as pretty as a girl on that day . For Sunia had ordered her women to make special garments for him , light blue silk trousers , a peach-pink short coat , the sleeves striped in red , blue and green , a blue vest buttoned with jade buttons , and on his head the pointed cap on the sides of which were the Chineses letters for long life and prosperity . Il-han had noticed that Sunia had cut the sides of this hat long to cover the child 's ears . She could not forget , and in her persistent grieving that her child was not perfect , he recalled again that he had heard of foreign doctors who could mend such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he wished not to add a sadness to the bright day . Guests had come bearing presents for the child and feasts were prepared for all , the best for the relatives and guests and lesser dishes for the servants they brought with them , as well as for his own . What he remembered now was his small son seated on the warm floor , while before him Sunia placed the objects for his choice , a sword , short and square-bladed , a book , a writing brush , a lute , and other such things . The child had looked at them for a while , seeming even at so young an age to know what they meant . Then he had put out his hand and grasped the handle of the sword , but he could not lift it and he cried and again he had tried to lift the sword and each time he failed and cried again . Sunia had coaxed the child with other objects , but he refused and hid his face in her bosom , sobbing . This younger son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bones fine and the flesh soft . From whichp163ancestor the elder child had drawn his square shoulders and unusual height none knew , but the second child looked like Ilhan'sfather . He had the same large poetic eyes , and fine brows and high forehead . There were times when Sunia said she believed that the old man 's spirit after he died had entered into the child , so quiet and staid were the child 's movements , and yet graceful . He liked to play with small animals , with birds , butterflies and goldfish . Especially he loved lighted lanterns and flying kites and music . Sunia could play the Black Crane harp , so-called because in the time of Koguryo a musician had made a new instrument from the ancient Chinese harp , and while he played a hundred melodies upon it , a black crane had come down from the sky and danced . This harp could persuade Il-han 's second son to come out of any melancholy or fit of weeping if he fell down or were ill . These were the qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still too young to reveal his individual mind and soul . Nevertheless , when he sat with this child on his lap and if the child followed him into the garden and clung to his forefinger , Il-han always saw the deformity of his ear and he determined that one day he would ask a foreign physician to mend it . He examined this ear carefully himself , and he concluded that the necessary flesh and skin of the lobe were all there , but that it had been crushed , perhaps by some position the child had taken inside the mother 's womb . his son 's folded ear lobe now became a reason for Il-han that he should bestir himself when the period of mourning was over and acquaint himself with men of the West , through whom he might find one to be a surgeon . Yet before he could fulfill this purpose , Il-han received a courierfrom the King 's palace , commanding his presence . Since the period of mourning was over on that very day , I1-han could not refuse . He put on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received by the King . " Do not stand on the ceremonies , " the King said when Il-han  |p164|pre|pared  obeisance . " You are to ready yourself to go on a mission to the United States . " Il-han was already kneeling before the King , his head bowed on his hands , and when he heard these words over his head he could not move . He , go across the wild seas to a country that for him was no more than a few words he had heard spoken ! His mouth went dry . " Majesty , " he mumbled , " when must this be ? " " If we are to make a treaty with the Americans , " the King said , " then I must know what their country is and what the people are . I have appointed three young men on this mission , but you are to accompany them and see that they behave well and that they observe everything . You may stand . " Il-han rose to his feet and stood with folded arms and bowed head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " In some haste , " the King replied , " for it is our wish to move quickly . We ratify the treaty with the United States at once , and before you and these others leave our country . I hear that the old Empress in Peking is displeased with Li Hung-chang , and declares that all treaties must still be made through China . But we must deal directly now with the Americans and establish our right as a sovereign nation so to do . " " Whom then do you send , Majesty ? " II-han next inquired . " First , " the King replied , " I have appointed my brother-in-law , Prince Min Yong-ik , Heir Apparent to the throne . " This prince Il-han knew very well . He was by adoption a nephew to the Queen , and was her ally . In the revolt the Regent had ordered him killed , but he had escaped his murderers by putting on the robes of a Buddhist monk and hiding himself in the mountains . The King proceeded . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister . I send him because he has already been ambassador to Japan , and he is not ignorant of other countries than our own . The third is one whom I keep constantly near my person , for I trust him . He is So Kwang-pom . " This young man II-han also knew . His family was an ancient  |p165one  , whose members through centuries had been known as wise and just . In this generation So Kwang-pom believed zealously that Korea should be independent of China , and he had headed a party of other men who so believed . He had even once gone secretly to Japan and had returned to tell the King fearlessly how Japan was changing into new ways , and was making new weapons , and dreaming even of making war upon China . The young man was a baron , and by inheritance , and this gave him the right to have access to the King . All three men were young , about thirty years of age , but this third one was the most modern and bold , while Min @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Queen . " Besides yourself , " the King was saying , " I have chosen two others , Chai Kyung-soh , who is skilled in military affairs , and Yu Kil-chun , who has also lived long in Japan . " I1-han bowed his head . " How can I refuse the royal com-mand ? " The King accepted this decision and with a brief nod , he strode from the room . Il-han could only return to his house , his mind in a daze that the King had moved ahead of his advice and with such speed . On a certain day in late spring of that same year , sixteen days after the King had told him that he must go abroad , Il-han was again on his way to the palace by command . He wore his court robes , on his breast the square of silver brocade embroidered with three cranes to signify his high rank . The day was fine and he had commanded the front curtain of his palanquin to be raised so that he could enjoy the mild air and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal summons was the ratification of the treaty with the United States , a solemn ceremony . True , ratificationhad been long delayed , but preparation had begun even before the revolt of the Regent and all the sad events that had taken place until he was safely exiled . The important first steps were taken when Shufeldt , an American officer whose rank was Commodore , had negotiated the treaty under the approval of the Chinese statesman Li Hung-chang who , wishing at that timep166to remain in his own country , had sent his representative , Yuan Shih-k'ai , to live in Seoul and uphold China as suzerain over Korea , and this although the treaty asserted that Korea was a sovereign nation and needed no conference with Chinese before it was ratified . Thus far affairs had proceeded until the Regent routed the Queen from the palace and disturbed the nation . Now that the King was again in power he commanded ratification on this day . For Il-han the day was the beginning of his long journey abroad . He had not yet told Sunia , knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning his health , the strange foods he must cat , the foreign waters he must drink , the wild winds he must breathe , all different from those in his native land . Yet today , after the treaty had been ratified , he would have to tell her , for there could be no delay in the journey . Two hours after noon , then , on this nineteenth day of the fifth month of the solar year of 1883 , and the sixth month of the lunar year , Il-han stood in the great hall of the Royal Office of Foreign Affairs . With him were Min Yong-wok , president of this office , and the chiefs of the four royal Departments , each with his retinue . Il-han was present at the King 's command as special representative . The day was mild with approaching summer , the wall screens were drawn , and the gardens lay in full view in the clear sunlight . At the appointed hour all were ready and ten Americans entered the hall . Il-han had never seen them close and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall men and they wore naval uniforms of red and gold jackets over black trousers . One man wore gold wings on his shoulders , the sign of highest rank . The ten came forward and the court crier announced in a loud voice the name of the leader . " General Lucius H. Foote , Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Kingdom of Korea ! " The name Foote , translated , astonished the Koreans , and for a moment Il-han himself was confounded . Was this a mischievous  |p167trick  of the announcer , a design to embarrass the foreigners ? Foot ? Could a man of high rank be so absurdly named ? He caught the eye of Min Yong-wok , and they exchanged a questioninglook . But no , the Americans were not angry , since they understood no Korean , and they presented the treaty in English to President Min , and the president presented , in return , the Korean copy . The ratified treaties were exchanged between the two men and thus a bridge was raised between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took no more than a few moments . The Americans then withdrew and I1-han returned to his house , marveling that in so short a time two nations could enter into friendship , their millions of people tied together by a piece of paper and written words . " I shall die while you are away , " Sunia said . " You will not , " 11-han said . It was the middle of the night . They were in their own room and the house was silent about them . Outside in the garden pools the young frogs piped their early song of love and summer . He had told Sunia that he was going to America at the King 's command . She had listened without a word , and now she said simply that she would die . She did not answer his denial . There beside him she lay , her hands locked under her head . He looked down into her face , pale in the moonlight . " You will not have time to die , " he went on . " While I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must visit her , hear her complaints , advise her , watch over her , consider her . " " I will not , " Sunia said . " You will , for I command you to do it , " I1-han replied . " Moreover , you are to become acquainted with the wife of the new American ambassador . You are to know her , you are to present her to the Queen as your friend . " " I do not know even her name , " Sunia said , not moving . " She is Madame Foote , " II-han said.  |p168Sunia  heard this and suddenly she laughed . " You are making jokes ! Foot ? No  --  noHe let her laugh , glad of the change in her mood , and she sat up and wound her long hair around her head . " How can I call her Madame Foot ? I shall laugh every time I see her . The female Foot ! How did the man Foot look ? " " Like any man , " Il-han said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and red eyebrows over blue eyes . " He was glad that Sunia was diverted , and he went on to describe the Americans , their height , their high noses , their great hands and long feet , their trouscrcd legs and clipped hair . " Were they savage ? " Sunia asked . " No , " Il-han said , " only strange . But they understand courtesy and they seem civilized in their own fashion . " In such ways he led her to accept the matter of his crossing the sea and entering into foreign countries . It was no easy task , nevertheless , and all through the summer months , while preparationwas made , she busy with his garments both for heat and cold , with sundry packets of dried foods and ginseng roots and other medicinal herbs , there came dark hours in the night when she clung to him , weeping . She insisted that at least his coffin must be chosen before he went , lest he die while he was abroad and his body be sent home with no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good coffin of pinewood , and had it placed in the gatehouse , while he laughed at her and told her he would come back healthy and fat and far from dead . The day of departure drew near , in spite of everything , and Il-han made his last visit to the palace , appearing before the Queen and then the King . To the Queen he commended his wife Sunia . " Let my humble one take my place , Majesty , " he said . " Accept her service , and let her do your bidding . Tell her what you would tell me , for she is loyal and has a faithful heart . I have only one request to make for myself , before I leave . " " I shall not promise to grant it , " the Queen said . She was in no good mood on this last day , for she did not favor friendshipp169with the Americans and had mightily opposed the journey . Il-han ignored her petulance . He proceeded as though she had not spoken . " I ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassador to visit you here in your palace . " At this the Queen rose up from her throne . " What , " she cried . " I ? You forget yourself ! " " The time will come when it must be done , Majesty , " he said with patience . " Better that you act now with grace and of your own accord than later by compulsion . " She walked back and forth twice and thrice , her full skirts flowing behind her . On the fourth time she drew near to the end door of the audience hall which led into her own private rooms . There , without looking back at him , or pausing to speak one word , she disappeared . For a long time he waited and she did not return . Then a palace woman came out and bowed to him and folded her hands at her waist and spoke like a parrot . " Her Majesty bids you farewell and wishes you a safe journey . " She bowed again and turning went back from whence she had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breast he felt a strange sore pain of an unexpected wound struck by one he loved . He hid it deep inside himself , and refused to allow himself to examine his own heart . He had no time , he told himself , to fret about a woman 's ways , queen though she was . He bore the monstrous burden of his people and carrying this burden always with him , he bade his household farewell , accepting the anxious hopes for his safe return . The last moments he spent alone with Sunia and their sons and to comfort her he stood before the ancestral tablets and together they lit incense and she prayed , her voice a yearning whisper . " Guard him all the way , " she besought those dead . " Keep him safe in health and bring him home again living and with success . " The second son , whom I1-han held in his arms , began suddenly  |p170to  cry , but the elder stood as stiff as any soldier and said nothing . There was no time left for child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long instant and tore himself away . He stepped into his palanquin while a crowd stood by to watch and cry farewell . Then he felt himself lifted from the ground and borne swiftly on his way . On the fifteenth day of the ninth month of that solar year , II-han and his fellow compatriots arrived at the capital city of the United States . During the long sea journey he had studied the language of these new people , the only one so to learn , for the others saw no need to know a language they would never use . But he , with the help of a young Catholic interpreter , shaped his lips to the unusual syllables , and when he reached Washington , a city named for the first President of these people , he was able to read signs and the large print of newspapers and even to understand a few words spoken . Already ll-han knew that his own people had much to learn from the Americans . Even the ship in which they traveled had been dazzling in marvels and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life had been upon the seas . With this man he had climbed upon the bridge and watched the turningof the wheel that steered the ship , and he descended into the bowels of the ship and saw the great furnaces where naked men threw coal into the monstrous maws to make steam that drove the ship with power . The train in which they had crossed the continent had provided further marvels , the engine powered by the same steam , and at such speed that even he was dizzied , though not vomiting as his fellows did . Five days they sped across mountain and plain , and he was overwhelmed by the vastness of the country , and astonished at the fewness of its people . Here in the American capital he met the greatest marvels , especially the water , hot and cold , that gushed from the wall , and lamps whose fuel was an invisible gas . Much discomfort there was too . He could not sleep well in a bed high from thep171floor , and twice he fell out as though he were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pulled the mattress to the floor . The food was unpalatable and tasteless and he missed Sunia 's kimchee , and the spices and the richness of his own foods . Moreover , there were those eating implements , a pronged fork , a sharp knife , and he could not cut the slabs of meat , nor down it running red with blood . He chose a spoon and such foods as he could sup . These were small matters , and soon he learned his way about the city , though only with the help of a young naval officer who had been appointed to stay with the delegation from Korea , an ensign named George C. Foulk . Seeing the name printed , Il-han spoke it complete until the young man had laughed . " Call me George , " he said . This George Foulk had lived four years in China and Japan and once had even spent a few months in Korea , so that he spoke Chinese and Japanese and some Korean . II-han was fortunatethat he himself was not official in rank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others waited here and there , he walked about the city with George and listened with lively interest to what the young man explained of history and science and art in the streets and museums and buildings . All that he , Il-han , saw and heard he stored in his mind , to be used for his own country when the time came . Nevertheless , the formal meeting with the President of the country , whose name was Chester A. Arthur , Il-han must attend as special representative of the King of Korea . It took place not in the capital but in the city of New York in a great hotel where the President was staying , for what reason 11-han did not know . Thither they went and were installed in palatial rooms , where they waited for the appointed time . The day arrived and the hour , and I1-han prepared himself . He wore his richest robes of state , a loose coat of flowered plum-colored silk over a white silk undertunic . Over these he put his ancestral belt of broad gold plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satin embroidered with three cranes in white silk thread , sur/rounded with a border of many colors . On his head he wore the tall hat traditional for yangban noblemen , made of horsehair woven upon a bamboo frame and tied beneath his chin . Besides himself only Min Yong-ik , the head of the delegation , wore such robes . Two others could wear aprons with one crane embroidered on them . The rest wore no breast aprons but the coats of plum-colored silk and the white silk tunics in blue or green with tall hats . Shortly before noon , word came that the President was ready to receive them . He stood in the center of the parlor of his private suite , and 11-han , entering first , saw a thick-bodied man wearing tight gray trousers and a long dark coat cut back from the waist . On his right was his Secretary of State , a man surnamedFrclinghuysen , who stood quiet and apart . On his left was his Assistant Secretary , surnamed Davis , and several others , among them George Foulk . I1-han and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a line before the American dignitary . Then at a signal from Min Yong-ik they knelt at the same moment , and raising their hands high above their heads , they bent their bodies forward slowly in unison until their foreheadstouched the carpeted floor . They remained in this position for moments , and then rose and went toward the President , who , with his suite , had bowed deeply as they entered and so remained until the Koreans had risen . Now Frelinghuysen came forward and he led Prince Min to the President and introduced him . The two clasped their hands together , Prince and President , and they looked deeply into each other 's eyes , murmuring compliments , each in his own tongue . One after the other the Koreans were introduced to the Americans , and then the Prince and the President exchanged formal greetings , each in his own tongue , translated in turn . After the ceremonies , the Koreans retired , and on that same days they took ship . With the American officers delegated to accompany them , they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manufactories.  |p173Time  fails me Il-han wrote to Sunia in the days following to tell you of the many sights I have seen . My head is crowded with sights , my mind is enriched , and I shall need the rest of my life to tell you everything . I have seen great farms where machines take the place of men and beasts , and these I have observed most carefully , for you know my concern with the life of our landfolk . Alas , we are centuries behind these Americans ! But I have seen the factories where textiles are made , especially in a city named Lowell , and there , too , I perceive how far behindwe are with our handlooms . I can not deny that our stuffs are finer , especially our silks , but can we compete with machines ? I have seen hospitals and telegraph offices and shipping yards , the great shops of jewelers and merchants of all kinds . Tiffany in New York is a mighty name in jewelries , and I was glad I had not you beside me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have contained you , or myself for that matter , who wish to give you all you long for . The post office  --  ah , that we had such speed and exactitude , a letter posted today hundreds of miles away by tomorrow , and this not by foot but by train ! And I saw sugar refineries where the whitest sugar is made , all by machines , and fire vehicles , whereby fires in great cities are put out before they destroy a hundred houses , and great newspaper offices , and above all , I saw the military academy at a place on a great river , where young men are trained as officers of the national army here . These and much more I have seen , and when you and I are old , Sunia , and sitting upon our ondul floor together , I shall still have new things to tell you , for a lifetime is not enough for all I have seen . When the mission was ended , the Koreans bade farewell to the President in his palace , for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its duties . On the last day , they divided themselves . Some went to Europe and homeward by the Suez Canal , some went home directly by the way which they had come , but upon the President 's invitation three went homeward on an American warship , and with these went Il-han , for George Foulk accompanied them , and Il-han wished to stay by this young man and with his help gatherp174more information concerning the history and political life of the western peoples . By now Il-han could read books in English partly by himself , but George Foulk was there to help him when he could not understand , and Il-han made translations of such works for the King to read , and for the Queen , if she would . Only Prince Min would have nothing to do with such works . He declared that Korea could never match the western countries and therefore her strength must remain in her own old ways . So saying , he retired to his cabin on the ship and returned to the Confucian books he had brought with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foulk to Europe , where they disembarked at Marseilles , and for seventeendays they traveled through other new countries and saw still more new sights , until II-han , fearing that by now one sight would he confused with another , spent every evening writing down what he had seen during the day and where he had seen it . It was spring again before he reached home , and indeed all but summer , for it was the last day of the fifth month of the solar year , 1884 , when the ship weighed anchor in the harbor at Chemulpo . From there they were escorted to the capital in sedan chairs and on horseback , and Il-han chose a horse , and so did George Foulk . Side by side they rode through the sunlit landscape , but neither saw the surrounding beauty . They talked long and quietly together , and the burden of their talk was Il-han 's fear that Prince Min 's influence might be against reforms . " Our only hope , " he said , " is to leave the past and move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand now that a small country can grow strong by means of science and machines . We must search out our best young men and send them to your country to learn , and return them here to teach . We must open colleges for our youths . Yet how can I persuade the King when Prince Min is so powerful ? And certainly I shall not be able to persuade the Queen , whose relative he is . I make a prophecy and I pray it will not come true . The Prince , I prophesy with fear and sadness , will pretend to have interest in what he hasp175seen , but it is only pretense . He will pretend to suggest reforms and then he will prevent them in secret . This is my fear . " He gazed far across the land as he spoke . The season was the planting of rice and in the valleys the farm families , young and old , were thrusting the young plants into the shallow waters of the rice fields . In the bamboo groves the new shoots were waist-high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own house Il-han descended from his horse and beat upon the gate with the stock of his whip . He was alone , for Foulk had parted from him at the city gate to go to the American Embassy , and the others had stopped earlier at their own homes . Il-han 's house was the farthest and so he was last and he stood waiting . The gate opened a crack and he saw his servant peer through , and then fling the gate wide and fall to his knees to put his forehead in the dust . " Master  --  master  --  you sent no word ! We did not know when to expect you . " " I did not know the exact hour or even the day , " Il-han replied . He lifted the man as he spoke and then strode through the gate into the gardens and to the house . Silence was everywhere , and he inquired of the servants , who now came running , where their mistress was and his sons . " Master , your sons are flying kites on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and our mistress waits upon the Queen . " " Does she go often to wait upon the Queen ? " 11-han inquired . " Indeed she is the Queen 's favorite , " a woman servant put in . Il-han could but go to his own rooms then to await Sunia 's return . Meanwhile he sent for bath water and fresh garments and for the barber to shave him , and while he made himself clean , he rejoiced in his return to his own house . All seemed better even than he remembered , and when he was finished with barber and bathboy and servant , he strolled in the gardens , and saw how the trees had grown , how the plants flowered . The blossoms on the persimmon trees were yellow and in full bloom and the goldfish were merry in the pools and a bird sang in thep176bamboo grove . Here he waited for Sunia , and suddenly he saw her , her full skirts of apple-green silk flying behind her in the speed of her coming . He opened his arms , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves kindly , and she ran into his embrace . Oh , good it was to feel her in his arms , her warm body pressing against his , her sweet cheek against his ! " You should have told me , " she breathed . " I have missed all the expecting . How can I believe you are here ? " She drew back to look at him , to feel his arms , press his hands , clasp his waist again . " You arc older , " she exclaimed . " I think you are thinner . " She paused to stare at him aghast . " You have cut off your hair ! " He had not told her that he had cut his hair . " I cut it  --  " he said and was stopped by her stricken look . " You mean you are not  --  you wish you were not  --  married to me ! " What could he say ? It was true that when a man married it was old custom that on the crown of his head he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are new times , " he said somewhat feebly . She looked at him with doubt and then a smile caught the corners of her mouth . " You want to look different from other men here , you want to be anything that is willful and stubborn . Oh , you are not changed , not a whit , hair or no hair . " They embraced again , with passion , and hand in hand they walked into the house . " Before the children come home , " Sunia said , " let me tell you why I am so late . " She proceeded then to tell her tale and Il-han listened , marvelinghow she too had changed and was no longer the shy girlish woman she had been . Here then was the gist of her story . While Il-han was in foreign lands , the American General Foote had endeavored to present himself to the King and the Queen , but the Queen had refused to receive him , and she forbade the King to receive him.  | " What , " she had exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me ? Let the chief of the Foreign Office receive this Foote , not we who are truebone royalty . We are too high for him . Is he a yangban in this country or even in his own ? " When she was told that Americans had no yangban she grew more willful . " All the more reason , " she declared , " for not receiving one of them in our palaces . " Thus it went until Sunia devised a clever scheme of her own . She had become friends with the Queen in her own woman ways , and she perceived that the Queen liked new sights . Thereuponshe herself went one day to call upon the female Foote , and quite alone except for a woman servant , she entered the mansion where these Footes lived . All was strange to see . The tables and chairs were high , the floors were covered with thick wool mats , and the walls were decorated with foreign scenes and portraits of unknown persons . The female Foote received her kindly , nevertheless , welcoming her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the high chairs , from which her feet swung clear of the floor , it was so high , and she was afraid of falling off , until the lady Foote saw her distress and bade a servant put a stool under her feet . This foreign lady could speak some Korean , much to Sunia 's surprise , though with a strange twist of the tongue , and she was free and gay and she asked many questions which Sunia answered , until soon they were two women talking together . The lady then asked Sunia if she would like to sec the house , and when Sunia said she would , for her curiosity was sharp , the lady Foote took her everywhere upstairs and down but the worst was when Sunia was compelled to come down the stairs again , which she could do only by sitting and sliding from step to step lest she fall headlong , since never before had she been that high . She saw many things in that house , a machine that could sew fine stitches , another machine that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep off mosquitoes , an iron cook stove , and such things , more than she could count.  |p178All  this she told the Queen , and when the Queen asked how the lady Foote was dressed , Sunia said , " She wears a full skirt held out by a thin hoop , and her upper body sits on top like a Buddha on a mountain . " At this the Queen laughed aloud . Then she looked thoughtful . At last she spoke . " Perhaps I will invite her to come here and show herself . " " Majesty , I pray you will do so , " Sunia replied . " It is more diverting than a play to sec her walk . Her feet are hidden and one would think she went hither and thither on wheels . And her waist , Majesty ! It is small like this . " She measured a little circle with her two hands . The Queen marveled . " How can that he ? Is she divided in two ? " Sunia had wondered for herself how it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant in that home , who had told her that the lady Foote encased her middle in a steel-enforced box . So she told the Queen . " She boxes herself in at the waist , to make herself small . " Upon this the Queen could not restrain her curiosity , and the lady Foote was invited and the Queen sent her own palanquin to fetch her to the palace . Alas , as the bearers told everywhere , the lady could not squeeze into the palanquin because of her wide skirts . " However high we raised the front of the palanquin , " they told , grinning at every word , " she could not get herself inside . Even her husband stood there laughing , and we all laughed . But she was not put off one bit and , laughing with us , she backed in like a mule between shafts . Then her skirts stood out so far that we could not put down the front curtain and so we carried her through the streets . The thousands stood to watch us , for word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their houses . Some even hid beneath the palanquin and we beat them out with bamboo sticks . " Thus the foreigner was carried through the streets until they came to the palace . There she had new difficulty in descending  |p179from  the palanquin and she must be pulled out and set straight , whereupon her skirts belled out in a vast circle , a pretty sight , Sunia said , for her gown was made of rich golden silk , long in the back like a tail , and the front was hung about with wide lace and there was lace falling from her sleeves over her hands . Only one part of her was unseemly , and this was her front , where her breasts stood out like hillocks under the silk . This , Sunia concluded , was the misfortune of the foreign women , that they had big breasts . At this moment she paused and looked at Il-han sidewise . " And did all the women in America have such swollen breasts ? " she inquired . Il-han looked sidewise at her in return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . So she went on with her tale . When the King heard the female Foote was coming he declared that he too must see her , which he could not unless the Queen allowed . She granted his wish , however , and Sunia met the guest in the reception hall and led her through the antechamberand into the throne room , where the King and Queen sat on their thrones , with a nephew prince at their side . Sunia had taught the guest how to salute the truebone royal pair and she , though foreign , performed the salutations very well and then stood while the King and Queen rose . The King wore a long robe of dark red silk , the Queen wore a long flowing skirt of blue silk and a jacket of yellow silk most exquisitely embroidered with multicolored flowers and fastened with buttons of amber and pearl . Her long black hair was fastened in a smooth coil at her neck with pins of filigree gold set with jewels . Upon her nobly shaped head she wore an ornament also of jewels , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tassels . The King and Queen exchanged speeches with the lady , their guest , and she responded so freely and with such spirit in her simple language that soon they were laughing together . The royal pair then sat down again , and an ebony stool was broughtp180for the guest since she could not sit upon a floor cushion , so upheldwas she by her hooped skirts . " The Queen , " Sunia told Il-han , " was by then so pleased with the ease and freedom of the lady Foote , that she declared she would make a fete champetre for her in the palace gardens , and she invited her on that very day to return another day for this fete . " " And did she so ? " II-han inquired , marveling at the ease with which Sunia had accomplished such a victory over the Queen . " Never was there such a fete , " Sunia exclaimed and she describedit , her hands flying like birds while she talked . The fete , she said , excelled all fetes that were ever heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms escortedthe Queen and the guest through the gardens . All the trees had been brought to blossom at the right day , apricots and plum and cherry , and great displays of chrysanthemums , out of season , glowed among gold-lacquered pagodas and pavilions . Fairy teahouses and miniature temples the Queen had commandedbuilt for the occasion , and music sounded through the groves of bamboo and flowering trees and among willows droopingover ponds . Bright-hued birds the Queen had commanded to sing and fly had been brought from the southern islands and servants in garments as bright flitted everywhere like butterflies . The guest wore new garments , Sunia said , the skirts wider than she had before and her arms were bare , but she wore gloves of soft white leather so long that they clothed her arms like sleeves . The court ladies clamored to try these gloves on their own hands , but their hands were like baby hands inside the gloves . These ladies played with the guest 's diamonds and felt her boxedinwaist and asked where she bought the creams that made her skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it took all day to see the many sights the Queen had commanded for the astonishment of this foreign guest . Musicians sat inside the pagodas and strummed their lutes and two-stringed violins , gongs sounded their mellow notes . Near the bank of a lake where lotus bloomed , a budp181opened to reveal a small naked child whose waiting mother lifted him from his rosy bed . A sailing boat on another lake carriedgirls who danced old legends on the decks , acrobats swung from branches of the trees along the shores , and everywhere about the vast gardens troupes of actors made playlets for amusementof the Queen and her guest . " Indeed we all went mad with merriment , " Sunia said , laughingat her memories , " and when the lady Foote parted from the Queen the two embraced as though they were sisters and the Queen could not bear to let her go . And a good lucky thing it was that the fete came first  --  " Here Sunia 's face grew grave and she paused . " What next ? " Il-han @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , " Sunia said . " One moment she is all kindness and gaiety and the next she is a cruel witch . " He nodded . " So what did she do ? " he asked . " You know how many of the Queen 's kinsmen were murderedby the Regent , " she said . I1-han nodded again . " Well , " Sunia went on , " even before all this merriment the Queen made up her mind in secret that she would command the death of all those who had taken part in the return of the Regent . " " No , " II-han cried , aghast . " Yes , " Sunia said . " As soon as you were gone she commanded them to be killed . Some had already fled beyond her reach and she commanded that their wives and children should be slaugh-tered . " II-han covered his eyes with his hands at this , but Sunia went on , her voice steady . " Yes , she did , and it would have so been done except that Iwent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . I wentthat same night and begged her to move the Queen 's heart . " I1-han lifted his head from his hands . " Who told you ? " " Your man servant , " she said , " and he heard it from a eunuchp182in the palace , whose sister was among those doomed by the Queen . Upon that the lady Foote came in haste , uninvited and unannounced , only two days after the fete , and she faced the Queen . " Sunia paused to sigh and shake her head and bite her underlip . " She had asked me to accompany her , and I saw and heard all . Oh , that Queen ! Her face was hard as white marble , and her heart was not moved , not by one word that the lady Foote could speak . Why have you conic here ? ' she screamed . Who bade you come ? Leave the palace ! ' This she commanded . And then she screamed , I will sec your face no more . ' Such screams she made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last she knelt before the Queen , she took her hand , and she began to speak of the lord Buddha who bade us take no life , not even the life of a worm , lest it be hindered on its upward way , and she spoke of the noble Confucius , who taught us that the great are always merciful to the small , for in such mercy is their great-ness . " Il-han broke in . " Did the Queen listen ? " His throat was dry and his voice came in a whisper . " At last she did , " Sunia said , " but only when the foreign lady spoke of our own gods . She listened and her eyes grew soft and after a long while she said that the lives of all should be spared . At this the foreign lady wept and then the Queen wept , and they clasped hands and the Queen begged the lady never to leave Korea . And she sent her home in her own royal palanquin and she gave her that palanquin as a gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen home to the palace from exile in the poet 's house . " So long had Sunia talked that the sun was setting over the wall and now they heard the voices of the children at the gate . Il-han looked at her with eyes not only tender but proud . " You have done well , my wife , better than I myself could have done . From now on I share all my life with you . Man and woman , we are equal , partners in everything . I shall have no secrets from you , ever , so long as I live . "  |p183They  clasped hands and Sunia 's eyes brimmed with tears . Better than words of love were his words of acceptance and praise . " Alas , that my prophecy must be fulfilled ! " Il-han exclaimed . On this day he had met with George Foulk to renew their friendship , which they now did in a teahouse beside a small lake where lotus bloomed . Sitting on their floor cushions beside the low table , while a singing girl played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tones that the Prince , Min Yong-ik , had come the day before to make a private call upon the American Minister , Foote . The Prince had come , George Foulk said , with only three in his retinue and he had commanded even these three to stand outside the room where he was received by the American . Foulk had been summoned to act as interpreter , and so only he knew what had taken place . The Prince , he said , had seemed in a dark mood . His face was pale and his eyes were sunken as though he had not slept . He let his head hang , after salutations , and when the American inquired kindly whether he had enjoyed his journeyto the West , the Prince replied that he had come home deeply troubled and in sadness . " Why sadness ? " the American inquired . " I hope that my people did not show you discourtesy . " " No , " the Prince replied . " Everywhere we were given honor . My sadness is because I do not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressed and divided , and without hope . I low can we survive as a free people , when we are crowded by these surrounding powers ? Sooner or later they will cut us up and eat us in three parts , or one , triumphant , will swallow us whole . We are doomed by destiny , I and my people . I was born in the dark . I went into the light . I have returned into the dark again . I can not see my way clearly . I hope , yet even hope is feeble . " When Il-han heard this now , he could only repeat his fears . " You will see , " he told George Foulk . " The King will announce  |p184many  reforms , but none will take root . The Prince will not allow it . I1-han 's fears became reality . At first the King could not move fast enough to make reforms . He sent for Il-han again and again , inquiring into every detail of all that he had seen in America , and when he learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sent requests almost daily to the Americans , begging for military officers to show how a new army could be raised and trained and he asked for teachers of machinery and teachers in government and in every way of life , until George Foulk told Il-han privately that the Americans were distracted by such demands , and even put to embarrassment before the other western nations . " The other western nations are looking at us askance , " Foulk said . " They imagine that we are trying to settle into your country and take it for ourselves , whereas we have no such intent . " They parted in gloom each time these two , Korean and American , only to meet again and again , each to learn of the other in private ways . Il-han did not tell what he knew from Foulk to anyone except Sunia , and he and Sunia agreed that it was too soon to speak to the King , and not safe to speak to the Queen . Let the King swing his nets far , and when they saw what fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , although Il-han called upon both King and Queen in duty , he was cool in what he said , and gave no advice , nor was advice asked . But he knew that while the King worked feverishly for quick reforms and the building of a new nation before Japan grew strong and before a war broke out between Japan and China , or Russia and Japan , for Japan was set for war and conquest , the Queen worked in secret with Prince Min to stop each reform before it became real . In spite of such intrigue , the King persisted , never believing that the Queen worked against him . She was always gentle with him and came docile to his command , and he thought her as changed as he was when in the privacy of the royal chamber , one night after rare intercourse , he told her of what he had done and what he pleased to do . She listened , admiring and agreeing , and givingp185him encouragement , only to return to her own palace and plot with Prince Min @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she and the Prince loved their country , too , but in their way , and what they did was in true conviction that they must stay with China , their protector and suzerain from ancient times . Even Il-han was deceived to a degree that later astonished him when the revelation of all this took place at a great dinner given by Hong Yong-sik to celebrate the new postal system which the King had commanded to be established throughout the country . Since this Hong Yong-sik had been among those who went on the mission abroad , on return he had abetted the King and urged him on , until the King had made him the head of the new national post office . Hong had not only accepted the position , but he had become the leader of all those who opposed the old regime and , above all , Prince Min himself . Who could believe that Hong Yong-sik would go to such lengths ? On the day of the dinner , when the guests were assembledin the great hall , all was merriment and music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the next guest of honor was Prince Min himself , and after him I1-han and then George Foulk . Below these were other Americans , among them a physician surnamed Allen , and below him other Korean yangban . In the midst of the feast suddenly there was a shout . " Fire ! " The word rang through the hall . " Fire  --  fire ! " All started to their feet , but Prince Min rose first , for it was a law that a high military official should attend any fire in his neighborhood and give all aid to put it out before it spread elsewhere . But I1-han guessed that the cry was only a signal and he ran after Prince Min to warn him . Alas , it was too late , for certainamong the guests in the lower seats were running after the Prince . They tore off their brilliant robes of many-colored silks as they ran and showed themselves in common cotton garments underneath . These men pursued the Prince and caught him at the open door and they drew out short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped , climbing over the walls and leaping down the other side . Prince Min staggered back into the hall . Seven cuts had gashed his head open and one cheek had been carved out and hung down over his jawbone . His several arteries were cut and blood poured from him . Il-han sprang forward to catch the Prince as he fell , but he was not more quick than the American ambassador , who lifted Prince Min 's feet . Together they laid him down upon the cushions . The servants were wailing and running here and there in uselessness , but General Foote shouted to the American physician , Allen , and this man in a short time stopped the flow of blood with tourniquets of cloth torn from garments and held fast with the same chopsticks with which a few minutes before the guests had been caring the delicacies . The Prince by now knew nothing . Whether he would live or die could not be told , but after some time the physician Allen declared that there was hope for his life , and he sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus the life was saved . Il-han stayed near throughout , and when at last there was some assurance that the Prince would live , he urged the American ambassador to return to his embassy . " Your lady will be frightened to see you , " he said . " If you will permit me , I will go with you myself . " The American accepted this and the two men then went on foot , for by now there was no bearer or any equipage to be found , and George Foulk followed . Total confusion was everywhereand Il-han did not tell the American that he feared this attempt at murder was only the beginning of new revolt against the Queen . Together they walked through the crowded streets , pushing their way between the people , the snow crunching and cracking under their feet , until they came to the Embassy . Here when the gates opened Il-han saw for the first time the lady Foote . She stood in the doorway of the house , her full skirts of crimson silk flowing about her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lantern a servant held behind her.  |p187She  screamed when she saw her husband , for he was covered with blood . " You are hurt ! " she cried . " It is not my blood , " he replied . " It is the blood of Prince Min . They have tried to murder him , but they have failed . " So much Il-han could understand , and he prepared to withdraw , yet when he looked again at these two he was impressed by the intelligence he saw on their faces , and he remembered how good the lady had been and how she had kept the Queen from the folly of murder . He lingered a moment . " Your Excellency , " he said to the ambassador , George Foulk translating . " I must warn you now that this is indeed the beginning of a fire which we may not be able to put down . Let me ask the King to send his royal guard here to escort you to the palace where we can protect you . " Bloodstained as he was , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height and he took his lady 's left hand and put it in the curve of his right elbow . " I thank you , my friend , " he said , " but we must remain in our own place , my wife and I. In all circumstances I must insist upon the inviolability of my government 's embassy . Here there must be a center of peace , however the mob riots outside our walls . " When George Foulk had repeated this in his own language , II-han could only bow and withdraw . He looked back once , at the gate , and he saw those two , man and wife , standing side by side in the doorway . The woman 's face was as calm in determinationas the man 's , and he could but envy them their faith in themselves and in their government . ... When he returned to his house , he found Sunia gone . His man servant waited for him , weeping and distracted . " I begged her not to go , master , " the man wailed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . " " Surely she did not go in search of me ! " Il-han exclaimed . " She went to the Queen , " the man wailed . " She thought you might have gone to save the Queen . "  |p188The  tutor now ran out . " Sir , " he said , " it is the King who is in danger . " " How do you know ? " Il-han demanded . " I am told  --  I am told , " the tutor said urgently . " Never mind how , but it is said that the King has asked the Japanese minister for help and Japanese soldiers have surrounded the palace . A battle is taking place at this very moment . " I1-han turned at once . " Take care of my sons , " he commanded , and he ran into the street followed by his servant . On foot he made his way through the crowds now shouting and screaming , some for the King , some for the Queen , most of them only addingto the noise and madness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they too maddened to see him or care who it was that burrowed here and there and always toward the palace . At the palace gates he spoke to the chief guard and gave his name . All knew him as loyal to the King and allowed him to pass . 1 le entered then and saw in the gardens before the palace the bodies of the dead , some bleeding into the snow beneath a pine tree , some lying on the ice of a frozen lotus pond , and others scattered , twisted and crumpled . He bent and searched each face as he passed , and recognized one and another . They were all followers of the Queen , upholders of her determination to stay with the Chinese and oppose the reformers . Pools of blood lay in every crevice and low place , on stones and frozen ground , as he made his way toward the palace , expecting as he went to see the Queen herself bound with ropes and dragged out to her death . Then he lifted his eyes by chance and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag flying in the wintry wind . At this sight he took courage , and he wondered if the Queen , hiding somewhere inside her palace , saw that flag , too , and took courage with him . Suddenly , before he could reach the entrance to the palace , he heard a fresh uproar in the streets , and the sound of cannon . He stopped and listened and heard Chinese voices crying their war cries , and he knew what had happened . Yuan Shih-k'ai , the Chinese general sent by the Empress Tzu-hsi to maintain thep189power of her throne over Korea , had ordered soldiers to protect the palace and the truebone royal King and Queen . What could this mean but a battle between Chinese and Japanese , here in the palace itself ? I1-han ran into the palace then and into the King 's throne room . There the King sat on his throne , and by him sat the Queen , both in their royal robes , surrounded by a handful of Japanese soldiers . " In Buddha 's name , " the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majesty , " I1-han gasped , and threw himself before them , " I came to see if you were hurt . " " Your wife was here first , " the Queen said , " and I sent her home again under guard . If I am to die , I die alone . " " You will not die alone , " the King said . Before he could speak another word , the doors burst open and the Chinese soldiers swarmed in , carrying foreign guns and short Chinese swords . At the sight of them in such number , Japanese soldiers fled , leaping through windows and crashing through doors . Hundreds of Chinese followed them as they struggled to get to the Japanese warship that was in the harbor , but the Chinesecut them down until few indeed reached the safety of their ship . Then in fury the Chinese fell upon the wives and children of all Japanese in the city and cut them to pieces , too , and threw the parts into the water surrounding the ship . So violent was the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans for safety , and in that whole city only the American flag still waved in the wintry wind . Inside the Embassy the Americans took counsel , for they believed that they too would be attacked in the senseless frenzy of the mob , and they planned that if the mob broke through the gates and tore down the flag , only the lady Foote could save them . She alone was well loved by the people , for all knew how she had persuaded the Queen not to kill the families of those who had rebelled against her , and how she had done this by reminding the Queen of her own gods . If the mob broke in , therefore , it was planned that the lady Foote would sit in a chair in the middle of an empty room with all the valuable documents beside her , andp190she would ask the people to spare her and for her sake all her fellow citizens . This Il-han did not know until afterwards , when George Foulk told him . For in the end the mob did not enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above its walls . While this was going on II-han remained with the King and the Queen , for by now they were surrounded by the Chinese , and Il-han stayed with them until the city was quiet . When the Queen rose to return to her own palace he knelt before her and said nothing until she spoke . " Lift your head , " she commanded , and he lifted his head . " Get to your feet , " she said , and he rose to his feet . She gave him a long steady look . " There will be another time , " she said . " Watch for it  --  and come earlier to save me . " " Yes , Majesty , " he said . He waited until she was gone , and then he turned to the King , preparing once more to kneel but the King stopped him with lifted hand . " Here is sorrow , " he said , " when a kingdom comes between a man and his wife . " He dropped his hand then and bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I1-han reached his own gate , it was barred as though for siege . He beat upon the gate and he waited but there was no answer . " Beat again with me , " he commanded his servant . They beat four-handed , raising such clatter that doors opened along the street and neighbors put out their heads . When they saw what was going on , they shut their doors again in haste . In such times every small sign was of significance , and I1-han felt his heart grow cold with fear . Had some vengeance been wreaked upon his family by unknown enemies ? Enemies he knew he had for he had been friend first to the Queen and then to the King , and in his double duty doubtless he had made ene/mies on both sides . He was casting about in his mind to know what he could do , when suddenly the gate opened a crack and the gateman looked out . When he saw who was there he beckonedto Il-han to come in , but he held the door so that only he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate again . " What is this ? " Il-han asked . He looked about as he spoke . Silence was everywhere . The usual bustle of servants , the shouts and laughter of his children , and Sunia 's voice of welcome , all were gone . " Master , " the gateman whispered . " We had warning just beforesunset that this house would be attacked in the night . " " Warning ? " Il-han exclaimed . " How did it come ? " " The tutor told our mistress , " the man replied . " He was awayall day , after you left , and he came in at noon and he told . " " But why ? " The man shook his head . " I know nothing . Only my mistress bade us make all haste to leave and under her command we put clothing and food into boxes and baskets and as soon as darkness fell all went to the country except me . She bade me stay here until you came and to saddle your horse ready . I have saddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Il-han was astounded and somewhat vexed . " I Iow can I leave the city at this time ? All is in confusion and I do not know at what moment I shall be sent for at court . " The servant interrupted . " Master , these questions can be answeredwhen you are with our mistress again . Now we must leave , for who knows what lies ahead ? You could be seized at any moment . You must retire now to your grass roof , otherwise you will lose your life , and if the Queen is angry with you , your family , too , will die . Who knows whether she will listen a second time to the American woman ? " When Il-han still hesitated , the servant began to weep silently but I1-han would not allow such pleading . " Do not distract me with tears , " he said sternly . " I have more to consider at this moment than my own life or even the lives of my sons . "  |p192U|pon  this the servant sobbed aloud . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father stood here even as you do . I was only a boy but I stood beside him . But he was wise  --  he chose to retire to his grass roof and live and protest , rather than to let his voice be silenced in death . " " My father ? " Il-han exclaimed . " Go to his house , " the servant said . " Search his books and you will find what he was . You never knew him . " Why this moved Il-han he himself did not know , but he bowed his head in assent and the Hain went to the stables and led out the two horses , saddled and ready . 11-ban held in his restless horse until he heard the gate of his house barred behind him and then he galloped into the night . It was soon after midnight when he drew rein before the wooden gate set into the earthen wall which surrounded the farmhouse where his father had lived for so many years , alone except for his few old servants some of whom still lived here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside on the stone step , staring into the darkness and huddled in his padded jacket . The night wind blew chill and the moon was dark when Il-han came down from his horse and the old man wakened and lit his paper lantern and held it up . " It is your master , " Il-han 's manservant told him . " We are waiting for you , " the old man said , coughing in the night wind . With this he opened the gate , and Il-han strode into the courtyard . The sound of the horses ' feet told Sunia that Il-han had come and she opened the door of the house and he saw her there , her head lifted , the candles burning in the room behind her . He entered and closed the door . " I thought you would never come , " she said . " The road was endless , " he replied . " Tell me what happened . " Before she could reply they heard a knock on the inner door , and she called entrance and the tutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was no longer young.  |p193He  came in , not shy or hesitating , and he looked Il-han full in the face . " Sir , " he said , " shall I speak now or shall I wait until you are bathed and have eaten and rested ? " " How can I rest or bathe or eat when I know nothing of what has happened ? " Il-han replied . " Can anyone hear us ? " Sunia asked , her voice low . " I have my men on guard , " the tutor said . " Your men ! " Il-han exclaimed . " Who are you ? " The tutor motioned to Il-han to be seated , and Il-han sat down on the floor cushion at the table in the center of the room . He was suddenly very weary , and he braced himself for whatever news he must hear . When he sat , Sunia sat also , and he gestured to the tutor to be seated . Had he been only the tutor he would not have dared to seat himself , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been his master , the tutor spoke . " I do not know whether you have heard that a new revolution is growing everywhere like fire in the wild grass . Yet it is so . The landfolk are ready to rise up in every village and on every field . They can no longer suffer what they are suffering nor will they any more pay with their life and their strength for what is being forced upon them . " A dark foreboding fell upon Il-han . " I suppose you mean the Tonghak . " " Only a name for being in despair , sir , " the tutor said . " 1 must tell you that it was I who gave your household warning . I am grateful to you for sheltering me all these years in your house , as your father sheltered mine . Now I must warn you that the turmoil has only begun . The landfolk have lost hope . They have come together under the Tonghak banner and no one can foretell what they will do . " " Tonghak ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am , " the young man said . He stepped back and folded his arms and looked straight into Il-han 's eyes . " I can not understand this , " Il-han exclaimed . " You have hadp194ease and courtesy in my house . None has oppressed you or watched you . Why do you join with those Tonghak rebels ? " " Sir , " the man said , " I am a patriot . I take my place with our people . And who knows them better than you do , sir ? The landfolkare the ones who pay for everything . They only are the taxed , for we have no industries such as you say the western nations have . Here all taxes fall upon the land . When the King wants money for these new ventures of his , the new army , the post office , the trips abroad , such as the one you made , not to speak of the diplomats and the delegations , the new machines he wants to buy , where does the King get the money ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough , who pays for the corruptioninside the Court ? And outside as well , for every petty magistrate has his little court , and the Queen has her relatives and her favorites , and who pays  --  who pays ? The countryfolk who till the land , even the land they can not own , which they can neither buy nor sell because it belongs to some great landord , and he does not pay the tax , oh no , it is the lowly peasant who only rents the land who pays the tax ! Sir , does your conscience never stab you in the heart ? " Il-han stared at the tutor as though he saw a madman . " Am I to blame ? " he demanded . " You are to blame , " the tutor said , his voice and his face very stern . " You are to blame because you do not know . You do not allow yourself to know . You traveled through the country for many months , did you not , and you saw nothing except mountain and valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever heard of a Russian named Tolstoy ? " " I know no Russians , " Il-han said . " Tolstoy was a man like you , a landowner , " the tutor went on . " Yet his conscience woke . He saw his people , the people whom he owned because they belonged on his land , and when he saw them he understood that they were human beings and he began to suffer . Sir , you must suffer ! It is for this that I have saved you . " Il-han could not swallow such talk . It was enough for him top195be amazed that the meek young man who he had thought was only a scholar , employed to teach his elder son , now showed himself a stranger . " How have you saved me ? " he demanded . " I saved you as my father saved your father , " the tutor replied . " When angry people were about to kill your father in his time , my father persuaded them to let him retire to this grass roof . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tutor was relentless . " A good man , but he did not lift his voice when others were evil . And you too , you are a good man , but you do not lift your voice . You have access to the King and to the Queen but you have not raised your voice for your people . " Il-han returned look for look . " What would you have me say ? " For the first time the man 's black eyes wavered . " I do not know . " He waited a moment , biting his lip . Then he lifted his eyes again to Il-han 's eyes . " For that , too , I blame you . It is you who should know , and because you should know , because you must know , I have saved your life and the lives of your family . Today , in the congress of the Tonghak , I stood up and declared that among those who are to die you must not be killed . You  --  you are not to die ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brave enough , when you knew , to speak against the corruption of the government , and against the taxes heavy as death , and the pushing men from Japan who are bringing their cheap goods here for our folk to buy because there are no other goods . And above all , you must speak bravely against the Japanese tricksters who by one means and another are buying land from the landownersbecause the landfolk can no longer pay even the taxes on their harvests . " These words fell upon II-ban like blows from an iron cleaver . For a while he could not reply , and indeed for so long that the tutor could not endure the silence and he cried out again.  | " I tell you , it is only for this that I have saved you and your sons ! " To which Il-han again after a long silence could only answer with deep sighs and few words . " Tonight I must rest , " he said . " But tomorrow ? " the tutor insisted . " Tomorrow I will think , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went away , and suddenly I1-han was so weary that he could only look at Sunia , begging for her help . " You need not speak a word , " she said . " Your bath is hot , your supper is waiting and then you must sleep . " He rose . " You who understand  --  " Ile felt her hand slip into his and hand in hand they went toward the rooms she had prepared for their life . " What shall I call you ? " he asked the tutor . It was noon of the next day when he summoned the man to come to him alone . He had not yet seen his sons , and he had told Sunia that he would not until he had spoken again with the tutor . His older son was old enough to have been shaped by his tutor beyond knowledge , and he must know not only what the tutor had to say further but also what he was . It seemed to him , after his sleepless night , that all his years until now had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen and the call of the King , conceiving this to be his duty . Even his long journeysinto his own country and then into the foreign countries had been in service of the truebone royal house , rather than for the sake of the people . Was it indeed true that people and rulers must be separate ? When he served one , must it mean that he did not serve the other ? " I can no longer think of you as my son 's tutor , " Il-han said when the tutor came again into his presence . " You are someone I do not know . Your surname is Choi but what is your name ? " " Sung-ho , " the man replied . He smiled half ruefully . " I wish I could call myself after the great Ta-san of the past , but I amP197not worthy . I must continue merely to use the name my father raised for me when I went to school . " " Perhaps you will make a great name of it , " Il-han said . Sung-ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , " Il-han went on . " Ask what you will , " Sung-ho replied . Il-han saw how confident the man was , how bright his look , how straight his carriage . He sat on his cushion without diffidence , eager and ready . " Is it you who have shaped my elder son so that he prefers to live here in the country under this grass roof rather than in the city ? " " Inevitably I have shaped him , " Sung-ho replied . " At first it was only that the city was hot in summer while here it is always cool . But as I shaped him , I shaped myself . Had I not spent summershere with your father under this grass roof I might never have come to know the landfolk . " " Are the people on my land Tonghak ? " II-han asked . " They are , " Sung-ho replied . " At least all who are young . " Il-han smiled wryly . " Does this mean that you will all rise upin the middle of some night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said sturdily . " It means that we look to you to speak for us . " Il-han was somewhat confounded at this . Was he then in duress ? He poured two bowls of tea , so that he could have time to think , and he handed one to Sung-ho , but not with both hands as he would to an equal . To his surprise , Sung-ho also took the bowl with one hand , and not with both hands as he must from his superior . Il-han went on . " Tonghak is a dumping pot for all sorts of rascals and rebels , debtors who will not pay their debts , thieves who will not pay their taxes . " Sung-ho did not yield one whit . " You know very well how common people insist upon tricks and conjurings from those whom they love and admire , and who they think can protectp198them , and is it just to demand that every Tonghak be free from corruption when the yangban themselves are corrupt ? " It was Il-han who must yield . " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sung-ho softened his voice . " I exempt you always from the corruption of your kind . I know you to be an honest man , and I swore this in order to save your life . " I1-han laughed . " You will not allow me to forget that I owe you my life ! " " I will not allow you to forget , " Sung-ho agreed , and he did not laugh . Before II-han could proceed , he heard the voices of his two sons , one shouting in anger , the other wailing in pain . Both he and Sung-ho leaped to their feet , but the door burst open and II-han saw his elder son walking toward him and dragging somethingbehind him . This something was nothing else than his sobbingyounger son , bound hand and foot with rope . In his right hand the elder son held a dagger-shaped stick of bamboo . " What are you doing ? " Il-han shouted and seized his elder son while Sung-ho lifted the younger child to his feet and pulled away the rope . Without stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Il-han lifted his hand and slapped him first on one cheek and then on the other , and this so hard that the boy 's head turned left and right and left and right . Now it was the elder one who began to roar loud sobs . " You ! " I1-han said between set teeth . " You , who are a savage ! " " No , " the child sobbed . " I am Tonghak , and he is a yangban who takes money  --  " The younger child was loosed by now and I1-han clasped him and lifted him to his shoulder . The two men exchanged looks . " You have made my elder son into a criminal , " Il-han declared . Sung-ho returned his hard look with another as hard . " Forgive me , " he said . " I do not belong in your house . " With these words , he disappeared and from that time on II-han saw him no more , nor did he know where he went or whether he would ever return.  |p199Here  Il-han was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying , and a servant ran to tell Sunia , and in a moment or two she was there . The child she comforted was the elder one , Il-han observed , and he protested . " Do not comfort that one , " he exclaimed . " He would kill his brother if he could . " " How can you say so ? " she exclaimed . " He is only a child . " She put her arms around the elder son and murmured to him , and Il-han stood holding the younger one on his shoulder until suddenly he was impatient . " Come , come , Sunia , " he said , " let us make some order in this family of ours . Take the children away and feed them and put them to bed . Leave me alone for a while . " She obeyed , casting hostile looks at him as she went , to which he paid no heed . His own confusion must first be resolved before he could be father and husband again . Impatient to be alone , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor cushion facing the garden and sank himself into meditation . The disorder in his family was the disorder of his people . How diverse were the elements ! Here under the grass roof of his father'shouse , here where his father had lived out his long life as a scholar and a recluse , the spirit of the past descended again . Must he repeat the life of his father in his own life ? I lc had endeavoredto avoid the national disease of dissension . I lc had maintained a prudent and middle course , now with the Queen , now with the King , aware of old loyalties , yet ready for new . To live a floating life , swimming with the tide and never against it , ready for all change provided it was for the good of his country , he had nevertheless come to the same place where his father had come in the years before he himself was born , and this by a totally different path . His father had never wavered in his faithfulnessto the past , and so had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now he , the son , was hated by all , by those who clung to the Queen and by those who clung to the King . Was there no place for him in his own country ? If not ,  |p200what  could he teach his sons ? Here in his own house the Tonghakrebellion was brewing , while he unknowing had pursued his middle way . He felt lost and distracted and the day passed withoutclearing his mind or lifting his spirit . " All that I know about myself , " he told Sunia in the restless night , " is that I am Korean . I am born of this soil , I have been nurtured on its fruits and its waters . The blood and bones of my ancestors are my blood and my bones . Therefore I must know myself first . " She let him talk , his head on her breast . And after a while he said , " I have never had time to know myself . I have always been at the call of others . Now I shall answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass-roof house against the world . I shall be alone with myself . " Womanlike , she listened to such musings and answered yes , yes , do so , whatever you think best , and when morning came she busied herself again about the old house , silk-spinning and making kimchee and keeping festivals . To live in this country house after the years in the city was in itself a task , for here nothing was convenient . The kitchens were old and the caldrons worn thin , mice and rats ran everywhere , lizards came creeping out of walls , and spiders festooned their webs among the blackenedroof beams . In the wall closets the bed mattresses were mildewed , in the rooms the floor cushions were torn and their linings split . There were also her sons , and where to find a new tutor for them was a burden . " You must teach them , " she told Il-han one day , " or else you must find a teacher . " Who would dare come now to this house to teach his sons ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest they grow up fools and yokels . Yet he found the teaching a task , and he could only force himself to it , teaching them two hours in the morning and then setting them free for the rest of the day , and Sunia complained that they were twice as mischievous after he had taught them as they were before , the elder one always in the lead . At last she set Il-han 's man servant to watch them and keepp201them from falling into the fishponds and smothering in the rice vats and running down the road to be lost . As for Il-han , he did not know what to teach his sons and he could only teach them what he himself was trying to learn . As he studied afresh the history of his people , each day he made a simple lesson for his children of what he himself had learned the day before . His father 's books were his source and his treasure , and how vast the library was he had not realized until now . Here in the shelves of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for each of the subjects of learning , one for literature , another for history , another for philosophy , and the fourth for mathematics , economics and the calendar . With philosophy was also politics , for these two were inseparablytogether both in history and in the present , and one can not be considered without the other . He knew that his people were divided by geography . Those of the rugged north , where craggy mountains split the sky , were more rude , less cultivated , less learned than those of the south . Troublemakers they were called , revolutionary by nature , and the cause for this was partly in that most landfolk owned their own land . Moreover , they did not plant rice paddies but they grew wheat on dry fields . They were scornful of the people of the south , declaring them effete and lazy , scheming rascals withoutambition , working on land that others owned . This division went so deep that even here in the capital city , south meant those nobles whose families lived in the southern part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many generations , and north meant those whose houses were in the northern part of the city . The Noron , or northern , faction , was sometimes in power in government , and sometimes the Namin , or southern faction , took power . The struggle in the capital was the symbol of the struggle everywhere among his people , and he himself was a symbol , for he and his fellows had as children been kept within the circle of the Namin , and Sunia 's family had been Namin , like his , else neither his familynor hers would have considered it possible to allow marriage between them . Namin would not marry Noron . Yet it seemed toP202him sometimes as he continued day after day to study the books in the library and to express them in essence to his sons , young as they were , that this very division had its benefits . For while one faction was in power , the opposition in retreat fought it with vigor and device , and their rebellion was expressed in strong music and passionate poetry so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sources of dissension . This conception seemed to him so apt , so correct , that he cast about in his mind one day as to how to express it to his sons in language which they could understand . It was autumn again , the season of high skies and fat horses . Sunia and her women were making kimchec , and the smell of fresh cabbage , of white radishesa foot long , of red peppers and garlic and onions , ground ginger and cooked beef scented the air . She ran into his room , he looked up front his book and saw her there , wrapped in a wide blue cotton apron , her hands wet with salt , her beautiful face pleading and impatient . " Can you not keep the boys with you today ? " she demanded . " We are distracted with their naughty ways . The elder one throws the cabbages here and there like balls , and the little one follows him . I can not watch them and get the kimchee into the vats , too . That elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have smothered him without knowing it . " " Send them here , " he said , his own patience tried . They came in then , the two of them hand in hand , dressed in clean garments and with hair freshly combed . His heart melted at the sight of them in spite of himself , but he made himself stern . " Sit down , " he said as coldly as he could . They sat down , awed for the moment by his coldness , and he bit his lip , contemplating them as they sat facing him . Their brown eyes , so trusting and clear , their cream-white skin tanned by the sun , their red cheeks and lips , made him long to embrace them but he would not allow himself the pleasure . However his love welled up in him , he must control it and make the surface cool and firm . " Today , " he began , " I will tell you the story of Ta-san . Listen  |p203carefully  , for when I have finished I will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry if you show me that you have not listened . " " Is the story true ? " his elder son asked . " True , " he said , " and full of meaning for us nowadays , althoughTa-san lived before you were born or even I was born . But my father , your grandfather , knew him and learned much from him . " He then told the story of Ta-san , concerning whom he had found many notes written by his father . He would not confess to himself that it was the tutor 's mention of Ta-san that had rekindled I1-han 's interest and sent him searching among his father 's notes . " You must know , " he told his sons , " that our country , Korea , was the first in the world to make the printed word  --  that is , with movable type . " Here Il-han paused . He paused to see if his elder son would ask what movable type was , but he did not . Il-han then went onwithout explanation , for he believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to destroy natural curiosity . " There were many books when Ta-san lived and he read them . In this he was fortunate , for though our people have for a long time had books , common folk could not read them , first because they did not know their letters and second because they were notpermitted to share knowledge . Our rulers controlled all learning . But Ta-san could read and he read not only the books in his father 's house but also the books in the King 's palace , because he had passed his examinations with such high honor that even the King noticed him , yet he did not read all day . As he grew older , the King asked him to do many great tasks . One of them , for example , was to build the second capital at Suwon , where the King could retreat if the capital itself were attacked by enemies , and while Ta-san made plans for the second capital , he also devisedvised a way whereby big stones and trunks of trees could be lifted by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called a crane , could be used . He made many such inventions.  | " One day he found some books that told of what other countriesdid . Until now Ta-san had thought that all knowledge was in our country and in China , but in these new books he found such new thoughts that there was even a new god . Oh , but this made his enemies happy , for it was forbidden to read such books , and now they said Ta-san was a traitor and he had to leave his fine city house and move to a house in the country , far away . There he sat reading and reading and writing great books and speaking his mind  --  " " Like you , Father , " his younger son put in . Il-han had been thinking that his son had not listened and when the child said this with such intelligence and understanding , Il-han looked at him with a scrutiny he had never before given him . " Like me , " he agreed , " and in some ways Ta-san was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been before . True , the Noron were then in power , and he was a Namin , as our ancestors were , and so he could only write his books and keep them . But the day came when he was free again , and then the books he wrote could be read by all who could read . Some day you will read them , too , as I did , and as I am doing now . " " Why ? " This came from the literal mind of his elder son . " Because he did not sit in idleness , " Il-han said . " Because he roamed the earth and went among its peoples , while his body was confined to his own house and gardens . He made beautiful gardens , too , and he even built a waterfall . " " Then we will build a waterfall , " his elder son declared . The notion seized upon both children and they were on their feet in a moment and making for the door . " Wait , " Il-han called after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will do it together . " They halted , astonished that he could consider such play , and he reproached himself that he had not shared their life but forced them always into his . So he took a hand of each and they went into the garden , far from the kitchen court where the kimcheep205was being made , and I1-han spent that whole day with his sons , choosing a place in the brook where the water could be debouchedinto another channel to make a pool fed by the waterfall . This work took days to complete , and Il-han found the key to the teaching of his sons . First they must sit and learn for an hour or so much more as he felt they could bear , and then they went to the building of the waterfall and the pool . He saw to it that the work went slowly and so the months passed toward winter . To II-han 's own surprise , this life with his sons deepened his own life . No longer was learning apart from life . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he considered how he could apply it to his own tenant farmers , who maintained this farm he had inherited from his ancestors . Ta-san had declared that farmers should work collectively , each pooling his land into the general community ownerships . The harvests , he said , were to be allotted , after taxes , to the farmers in proportion to the labor they had given . Il-han could not approve the plan as a whole , yet he was amazed that within the stern controls of the Yi dynasty , so long ago Ta-san could conceive such changes , even though they were never used . And he pondered long upon the question of how his own tenants could be justly rewarded for their labor on his land . Here he sat inside his comfortable grass roof , shaded from the summer sun and warmed in winter by the ondul floors , and he drew in the money they earned for him , while they toiled in his fields and lived in crowded huts and ate coarse food . Wrong , wrong , his heart told him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man begin ? Moreover , he had not the power that even Ta-san had , though in exile . He assuaged his heart then by calling in his tenants that year after the harvest , and he met them on the threshing floor before the gate . They stood in the late sunshine , a ragged crew of sun-browned men , their horny hands hanging while they bowed to him . Nonep206spoke , and all were anxious , for why should a landlord speak to his tenants except to tell them that the rent was raised ? He perceived their anxiety and made haste to allay it . " I greet you , " he said , " to thank you for the harvests , which are good beyond the average . This I take it is at least partly because you have done your work well . For the rest , we must thank Heaven for rain and sun in proportion to the need . " They still looked at him with sullen eyes , doubting his intent , and suddenly he was afraid of them . The distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no bridge . " I will not keep you , " lie said . " I wish only to tell you that your share of the harvests will be doubled this year . " They could not believe him . ' l'hcy still gazed at him in fear mixed with doubt . Whoever heard of a landlord who doubled the share of the tenant ? Such good fortune was too rare . As for Il-han , he saw their doubt and he was angry at their ingratitude . No one spoke . He waited and when he saw that they had no intent to speak , he felt his heart grow cold and hard . " This is all I have to say , " he told them , and he turned and strode into his house and barred the gate behind him . Yet when he had time to think over their brief meeting , he blamed himself for his anger . Why should they feel gratitude ? For years they had toiled only to receive a meager share of the harvest . Even to double that share was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of centuries . It could not be mended in a day by one man on one farm . On one cold New Year 's Eve several years later , I1-han reckonedthat all he had done and thought and felt , added together , showed only two accomplishments . One was that his sons grew well and he had developed their minds beyond expectation . They were passing from babyhood to boyhood , the elder edging into his youth , although at thirteen he was still turbulent and impatientand argumentative , and he chose to make many quarrels with his brother , who in defense drew apart from him and becamesolitary . In a way this was a comfort to II-han , for hisp207younger son sometimes sought his company alone , partly for protection against the elder brother , but also because he and his father were much alike in loving books and writing poetry . This younger son had besides a tender love of music and he learned to play upon the kono harp so well that this became a cause of jealousy in the older brother . The elder was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very handsome lad he was , tall and strong , his eyes bright and bold , his nose straight , his lips thin , and he made fun of his younger brother 's light build . W hen he was angry , he even taunted the younger one for the imperfection of the lobe of his ear until one day Il-han , himself in rage , took his younger son to the American physician who had saved Min Yong-ik 's life , and he asked him to make the ear right again . The physician by this time was aged , and his hands trembled . Yet he examined the ear and then he called his assistant , a young Korean whom he had taught during the years . " Your hand is better at this than mine , " he told the man . " I will stand beside you and help you , but you must hold the knife . " Il-han stood watching . First they put his son to sleep , holding some liquid-soaked cotton to his nostrils as he lay on a table . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleep was too much like death , the young doctor , his hands encased in thin rubber gloves such as Il-han had never seen before , took a small thin knife from a tray held by a woman aide , and he cut the boy 's ear lobe and split it cleverly . Next with a needle and thread he sewed it into shape and attached it to the head . When all was finished , he tied on a bandage . " Come back after a few days , " the old American doctor said , " and in ten days or so , you will see your son 's ear as like the other as his two eyes are alike . " Sunia made much ado when I1-han brought the boy home again , for he had not told her , knowing she would be fearful and forbid it . But the ear healed well , and then the boy was perfect . Il-han was glad , except that he thought the elder son was colder to him than ever after the younger son was made perfect.  |p208So  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book that Il-han had been writing all these years . In it he put down , day after day , every wrong deed he heard done in the capital or in the nation . Friends visited him , though not often , and always in secret , and unknown men came to tell him stories of their sufferings , and again and again unknown members of the Tonghakcame to his house and he received them because of Choi Sung-ho , but Sung-ho himself never returned , and when Il-han asked a Tonghak where he was , that man shook his head or shrugged his shoulders and none seemed to know who he was or if any knew him , they did not know where he was . From whatever he learned from such persons and from every other source possible to him now , 11-han wrote in his book . He wrote down what every yangban spent on bribes and trickeries , and what every soban connived . When new governors were appointedfor the provinces , he found out what time they left and when they arrived , how much they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , or slept with as they went , who was bribed for what , and who welcomed them when they came to their new places , and who paid for the feasts and the dancing girls , and whether Japanese spies talked with them , and whether they met in secret with Japanese or Chinese or Russians , and if they traveled and where and how long they stayed away from their posts and who were their hosts and what favors were asked and if they were granted . When each such evil was known and written down in his book , and he saw how corruption weighed more heavily year by year upon the miserable landfolk , I1-han then wrote pages of what he believed should happen and how righteousness and justice could still be saved . In the long evenings Sunia , her day 's work done , sat listening while he read aloud to her what he had written . Sometimes she was so weary with her household cares that when he paused to ask what she thought , he saw she slept . He never waked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping face how much she had aged . The youthful beauty was gone , the lines of middle-age were clear , the same lines that he saw in his own face in the mirror in his bed/room . Seeing her , he only sighed and closed the book softly and let her sleep . Yet there were other times when she did not sleep and when she listened , admiring , yearning for the world he wrote of in contrast to what was . On one such night he saw her weeping when he looked up to ask her if he wrote well . " Now , Sunia , " he said , " have I written something wrong ? " She shook the tears from her eyes and tried to smile . " No , you have written all too well . But  --  but  --  oh , why can you not be heard ? Will anyone ever read this book ? I can not bear to think your life is wasted here under this grass roof . " He did not answer . Her question was the one he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps for his times and for his people , but not for himself . He had set the task of knowing what he was  --  he , a Korean . Now he knew . IIe closed the book . " It is time to sleep , " he said . " The night grows dark and there is no moon . " In the early evening of a certain night a messenger came on foot to the gate of Il-han 's grass roof home . Since he was a stranger , the gatekeeper would not admit him until he had himselfinspected the man 's appearance . When he had looked at the man from head to foot , he let him in , but held him in the gatehouseunder the guard of three other servants until he went to find his master and report the presence and the appearance of this stranger . Il-han had finished his evening reading of the Confucian classicswith his sons . In the mornings now their studies were in mathematics and history , in the afternoons their studies were in literature , and in the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them the Book of Poetry or the Book of Changes , expounding in simple words the meaning of the sonorous , ancient words . Each learning period was short for he knew how easily the thoughts of the young wander afield , yet he believed that by this thrice-repeated period each day , his sons ' minds would be permeated with learning and with knowledge of the good , andp210he dreamed that though his life might be useless , in the lives of his sons his own might continue with benefit to his people . In the calm of such comfort , then , he had bid his sons sleep well while he settled himself to his own studies , Sunia being absent at the moment and in the kitchen supervising the brew of a ginseng tea which he found soothing to his inner organs at the end of the day . At this moment the gatekeeper was announced by a servant and I1-han nodded his head for the man to enter . The gatekeeper came in and standing near the door in respect he bowed and then spoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate . I did not let him enter until I had looked at him well . tic is a foreigner . " Il-han let his pen fall from his hand . " Is he wearing foreign dress ? " " No , " the man replied . " He is in proper dress like yours , master . But his face is not our face . " " Did he give his name ? " Il-han asked . " He said that you would know him if you saw him . " " How could you understand a foreigner 's language ? " Il-han inquired . " He speaks our language , " the gatekeeper replied . They looked at each other , master and man . One thought was in each mind . Was this a ruse in order perhaps to stab Il-han ? Of all those whom the King had sent to America on the mission , only II-han remained free in his own house . Min Yong-ik , when he had recovered from his wounds , lived in exile , hiding here and hiding there , rejected even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Yong-sik , who had chosen not to flee with the Japanese when the Chinese soldiers entered the palace , had been cut to pieces before the King 's eyes . So Kwang-pom escaped to Japan and had lived there in exile these ten years , and here in his own country he was now called a traitor . Others were in prison , or in exile in unknown distant villages and farms . " Master , " the gatekeeper said in a low voice , " I will put my knife through this stranger , and throw his body in the pond . " For a moment Il-han was frightened , but at himself , becausep211he was tempted . It would be easy  --  a thing he would never do but if a gatekeeper , faithful to the family  --  who would know , or if knowing , blame the master ? The next moment he recalled what he was and was ashamed . What  --  had the evil of the times permeated him , too , and to the soul ? Because men were killed everywhere in treachery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus he inquired of himself , and the answer was no , and no again . He took his pen and fitted it into the silver cap and he closed his book and got to his feet . " I myself will look at this stranger , " he said . He strode across the garden and down the winding path between the mulberry trees kept for the feeding of silkworms , and then he stooped his head , for he was very tall , and entered the low-roofed gatehouse . Inside , the candle of cow 's fat guttered and in its wavering light he could only see a man leaning sidewise against the wall , his face in profile as he stared into the candlelight . He lifted his head when Il-han came near and then he spoke . " Have you been here all these years ? " Il-han knew him instantly , though the face was haggard and the eyes aged . It was George Foulk . He put out both his hands and the American clasped them . " I thought you were dead ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all your family and your house sealed . " " Is my house sealed ? " Il-han asked . " You have never gone back ? " " I have not gone back , " Il-han said , " but my servants have gone and the house was not sealed . " " Then it is only recently , " Foulk replied . " I sent my own guard to discover who lived in your house , and the gate was sealed and a soldier stood there . At first he too said you were dead , but when he felt money in his palm he said you were living but in exile here in the country . My friend , I must talk with you . Enough has happened in these years to fill a century . " In the shadow of the trees and the twilight Il-han led the American , still grasping his hand , into the house by a side en/trance . There he bade his servant allow no one to enter the room where they would talk , and not even Sunia was to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden of confessing , perhapssome day when confession might be extorted , that she had ever seen the American in his house . In the quiet of his study , the wall screens closed , he drew Foulk down to the floor cushion beside his , so that they might speak in voices too low for anyoneto hear . He trusted his servants , and yet he trusted no one , not even Sunia , for she was a woman and to save his life or her children 's she might one day tell anything . " Speak , " Il-han said . " The night is not long enough for me to know all you have to tell . Why do you come to me now after this long silence ? " " I want you to know that I am leaving Korea , " Foulk said . Now there was silence between them . Each gazed at the other in this silence . " Even you , " 11-han said at last . " Then , indeed we are lost . It means , does it not , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans , " Foulk said . " My people know nothing of yours . This is our sin against you . We are ignorant . In ignorancemy government has done nothing to save your people , for the result of ignorance is indifference , and indifference is a desert in which a whole nation can die . I cannnot stay to see your people die . I  --  love Korea . " These words fell upon Il-han 's ears , each a separate blow as he comprehended their import . " Tell me what has happened , " he said . In reply Foulk then told such a story that I1-han could not have believed except that he knew this American was all of a piece , so loyal in friendship , so true , that anything he said was true . The beginning , as Foulk told it , went back to the year of the treaty with the United States whereby Korea was declared by the Americans a sovereign nation , independent of China , her ancient suzerain . Independent , Korea could and did grant tradep213rights to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his wife and secretary and the translator Saito . " A mistake , that Saito , " Il-han put in . " You should not have engaged a Japanese translator . Who knows what words he added or took away for his own benefit ? " " A mistake , that Saito , " Foulk granted and went on with his story . " The Americans discovered , " he said , " that the King and his cabinet were too weak to exercise sovereignty , however many good men were with him . Men like you , Il-han Kim , even true patriots like you , were accustomed to subservience to the Chinese or the Japanese . You did not believe that you could be strong if you would be . " " I remember , " Il-han said slowly . " The king said he danced for joy when the Americans came . " " Yet how can we Americans overcome your fears rooted in the centuries ? " Foulk replied . " The King has leaned on us for everything . This has not only angered China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Germany would not ratify their treaties . My government was alarmed and they sent word at first to Foote and when he was gone , to me , that we could advise the King only personally , unless our government sent advice . Yet how could those men far away in Washington , those prudent local men , understand the vast troubles of your valuable country ? Knowing too little , we do too little . " He turned his head away , he bit his lips , muttering , " My government has not even sent me enough money to pay the legation expenses . My ambassador had no money for hiring a clerk and the secretary was serving without salary . We have no money to buy land for a proper legation building  --  not even land ! We should have consulates  --  other nations have their consulates , and they laugh at our parsimony . The great , rich United States of America ! I chose land at Inchon for a beginning , but no money has come for the purchase . Do you wonder that other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked around and around the room , his feet noiseless on the ondul floor . " I should not tell you this  --  it is our family business  --  we Americans  --  andI could endure it all , but your King  --  he keeps pressing me , begging me to give him American advisers . He has a hundred plans  --  all good ones  --  a good man , this King of yours  --  he could build the nation if he had half a chance , and if our government only knew  --  if they could only see what they are throwing away  --  the chance to help him build a strong independent free Korea  --  a bulwark in Asia ! " " Why do you not go home and tell them ? " Il-han asked . He was embarrassed by many emotions , fear for his people , dismay lest the Americans were indeed unable to help them , and despair for the . King . They must fall into the abyss of the greedy nations if no hand stretched out to them in friendship . Who could save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all else , " Foulk was saying , " my ambassador was reduced in rank . He was no longer Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary . He was only Minister Resident and Consul General . Of course he resigned . " Il-han could bear no more . " Stupidity  --  stupidity , " he cried under his breath . " How could your government send us a ministerof first rank and then degrade him ? " " He resigned , " Foulk said , " and there is no one to replace him . I am the only one left . " " Shufeldt ? " Il-han suggested . " Shufeldt will not come , " Foulk replied . " He knows too well what it means  --  a prudent man ! I wish I were as prudent ! " " How old is all this trouble between your ambassador and your government ? " Il-han inquired . " Old  --  old , " Foulk groaned . He sat down again . " Even before the dinner when Min Yong-ik was nearly killed . " " And you did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed , " Foulk said , " and I still had hope that we could persuade those men in Washington . " " When did your ambassador leave us ? " Il-han asked  | " The year after that dinner . " " And you ? " " I have been in charge ever since , without rank and helpless . And now I too give up . I want one Korean to know why  --  and you I can trust . " " I pray you , tell me everything , " Il-han urged . " It may be that I  --  " " No hope , " Foulk repeated . " But if you  --  want to know the worst , here it is . " With this he enumerated , one by one on his ten fingers , the steps by which he had come to his present despair . Left alone , he had returned to the task of beseeching his superiors to send the American advisers for whom the King so urgently asked . " The most pressing need of Korea in her present deplorable situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her troops  --  many of them . Well , what happened ? Three teachers were recommended by the Department of State ! The King said he would pay for their expenses , but they were not permitted to come , except under private support . And where was I to find the money ? " Now that he had begun his confession to I1-han it seemed that Foulk could not stop himself . He wrung his hands together , he ground his teeth in anguish . " I had no money , I tell you ! Because I was acting charge d'affaires I could n't even draw my navy pay  --  I was allotted half the minister 's fund , but I could n't draw the money . And then that German , that von Mollcndorf , he got himself appointed head of customs in your capital , since no American advisers came , and he has worked against me continually , trying to get German advisers into Korea with the hope of establishing German influence here  --  " " He did not succeed ! " Il-han exclaimed . Foulk went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doom and Il-han could only hold his head and groan as he listened . " No , but failing to get German advisers , he employed Russian advisers , at least for your armies . Then and for once China and  |p216Ja|pan  united in pleading with the King that American advisers be sent  --  they being above all afraid of Russia . Well , the American military advisers are now scheduled to come next year  --  four years too late ! The King has lost confidence in my country and my government and how can I blame him ? " Here I1-han opened his mouth to speak , but Foulk was not finished . " My pay drafts have been returned . Insufficient funds ! Appropriations for Korea have been exhausted ! And meanwhile I must handle affairs at Chemulpo as well as at Seoul , my country being the only one without a consul in Chemulpo ! I resigned six months ago ! " " But you are still here . " Foulk made bitter laughter . " No one reads the dispatches I send , therefore no one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your people  --  " Foull* paused here and leaned his elbows on the low desk , and shaded his eyes with his hands . His voice broke . " Your glorious people still look on me as the representative of the United States , the lodestar of their hope of independence ! But I have had to tell them  --  the leader of the new independence group  --  a brave young man  --  I wo n't speak his name even here  --  I have told him that my government is interested only in collectingthe indemnity for the General Sherman  --  lost so many years ago . " Foulk 's voice was trembling . He paused , he pressed his lips together and went on abruptly . " I can no longer carry the burden of representing my government  --  and my people  --  without even clerical or secretarial help . But I have n't enough money to pay the most necessary bills for the legation . It has all made me ill . My health has failed . I  --  look at this . " He held out his hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones gaunt and the skin drawn taut over the wasting muscles . What could I1-han say ? He clasped the hands of his friend in his own hands again and he bent his head down until his foreheadrested on their clasped hands and his tears overflowed . Foulkp217waited a long moment and then without further word he withdrew his hands gently and left the room . Some time afterwards , how long Il-han did not know , Sunia slid the door open . " Will you not come to bed now ? " she asked but timidly . " No , " Il-han said , and did not look up . She slid the door shut again and went away , and he sat the night through alone . ... Hours passed uncounted . Whether he was in the body or out of the body he did not know . Did he hate the Americans ? He could have hated them except that he remembered them as he had gone to and fro among them in their own country , a kindly people , enjoying the manifold benefits of their life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without friendship , as he now perceived . They were still too young for friendship , incapable of the deep bonds which bind one human being to others . Friendliness is shallow though pleasant , and it was unreasonable to expect a depth beyond their capacity . The mind must know , the heart must feel , before there can be understanding , and they did not know the long sad history of his people , nor could they feel the terror of being a small country set by chance among giants . The King had expected far too much . He and his fellows , Il-han himself , had expected too much of the Americans . It was their own ignorance of foreign peoples to mistake the easy promises of friendliness for the loyalty of true friendship . No , he could not hate them . Yet without them he knew his people were doomed . What then could he do ? His heart urged him to leave his grass roof and go to the King and the Queen and offer himself for their service , any service at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rid himself of the burden of his own knowledge . The King was no fool  --  he must know very well by now that he could trust no foreigners , the Americans having failed . And the Queen had never trusted them . The country was like a ship at sea , anchor lost , rudder broken , and captain helpless . He and all Koreans could only stay by their ship , wait out thep218storm , let destiny take its course . In kindness and forgiveness , he hoped that the friendly people in America would not know the opportunity they had lost and which would never again be offeredthem . Pray Buddha they would not some day be compelled to pay the costs ! " Father ! " Il-han heard his elder son 's voice and was startled , as though he had never heard it before . It was no longer the high voice of a child . It had dropped halfway down the scale , it was cracked and hoarse , the voice of a boy ready to become a man . How had this come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been too engrossed in the even smoothness of his cloistered days to notice . " Come in , my son , " he said . Ile stared at the lad as he entered the room . Surely he was taller today than yesterday , his hands bigger , his bones heavier . And his face was changed , the features thickening into adoles-cence- " Why are you looking at me , Father ? " the boy demanded . " You are growing up . " " I have been growing up for a long time , Father . " " Why have I not seen it ? " " Because you are always looking at your books , even when you teach us . Father ! " " Well ? " " I want to go to school in the city . " " What are you saying ? " I1-han closed his book and motioned to his son to kneel on the floor cushion opposite him . " You think I am not a good teacher ? " His son faced him with black eyes as bold as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn the new . " Il-han was about to reply sharply and then remembered as sharply . In his youth he had accused his father in the same fash/ion . In his son 's voice he heard his own again . He kept himself calm . " Are there such schools in the city ? " " Yes , Father , and there are some teachers from America . " " They are Christians ! " His son shrugged . " There are also schools with Japanese teachers . " " You wish to learn from Japanese ? " " I wish only to learn , " his son retorted . What could Il-han say ? He was wounded to the heart that his son considered him no longer fit to be his teacher , and yet he would not acknowledge his private hurt . He continued his argument . " It is all very well to have new learning , but this does not mean the old is without importance . " His son replied insolently . " We have had enough of this old stuff ! " Il-han @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he struck his son a blow on the cheek . The boy 's face grew red , his great eyes flashed . He rose , bowed and left the room . Il-han heaved deep sighs . He felt suddenly faint and his heart beat too fast . This son  --  as he strode out of the room he had looked a man , shoulders broad , long legs  --  ah , he should not have struck his son ! What could be done now ? Impossible for a father to repent to a son ! The elder generation does not ask forgiveness of the younger . And what if the son was right and he was no longer a fit teacher for this time of confusion ? What indeed did he himself know now of the world beyond this grass roof ? He pushed aside the book wherein he had been writing a poem . Of late he had found refuge for his troubled spirit in poetry  --  Oh , heaven , had not his father also taken to writing poetry , and what of the village poet in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Poetry was a drug , a vice , a cover for helplessness , or perhaps only indolence . He sat for a long time in meditation , searching his soul , accusing himself , submittinghis spirit to a humility difficult indeed for a man so proud.  |p220For  days after that he did not speak to his son . He conducted the lessons for both sons as usual . The elder son took no part , asked no question , did not look at his father , but he came and took his place and remained in silence . After ten days Il-han told the younger son to leave the room , for he had something to say to the elder . The younger son obeyed and Il-han was left alone with his elder son . He called him by name now , for the first time . " Yul-chun , I have considered your wish to go to a school in the city . You know I am in exile here in my own house . Is it not dangerous for you in the city when it is known you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yul-chun said . " I have friends there . " I1-han was amazed . " 1 low can you have friends when I have none ? " " I have friends , " Yul-chun repeated stubbornly . The two gazed at each other . It was Il-han who yielded . So his son had friends of whom he knew nothing ! A generation earlier a father would have insisted on knowing who his son 's friends were and how they had been made . But this , this was a new generation , one very far from the past , and he did not ask . He could not , for what if the son refused to tell the father ? What force had the father now to compel obedience ? " Well enough , " he said at last . " Then go . " " I shall live with my friends , " Yul-chun said . " Well enough , " Il-han replied again . " Only let your mother know where the house is . And you will need money . " He opened the secret drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he kept money for daily needs and gave the bag to his son . " Let me know when you need more . " He held back the grim words in his mind  --  with all his independencehe takes money from me . There was a bitter comfort in the knowledge and he needed any comfort . When his son had left the room Il-han went in search of Sunia and found her in the storehouse , standing by the scales to watch the measuring of rice for the household . Her dark hair was powdered with the white dust of the rice , and her eyebrows andp221eyelashes were white . It is how she will look when she is old , he thought , and for a moment he was saddened . Then he spoke to her in a low voice . " Will you come aside ? I have something to tell you . " She lingered until the tenant had called out the weight of the grain and then she followed I1-han into the garden where they sat down upon a stone seat in the shade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to school in the city , " he told her . She was wiping the rice dust from her face with her kerchief and she did not reply . " Are you not surprised ? " he asked . " No , " she said . " I knew that he would go . " " And did not tell me ? " " I told him he must wait a year , " she said . " I told him he was not to trouble you while he was too young to leave home . " " And you think he is not too young ? " " I think he is too old to stay , " she said . " So , " he said slowly , " so you have known all along ! You have kept it secret from me . How many such secrets have you ? " She laughed and then was grave . " I have only one purpose in all I do . It is to keep you at peace . If I told you every vagary and whim and ardor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in turmoil . You could not work . " " Work , " he repeated sadly . " I am not sure I have a work . An occupation , say ! " " Work , " she repeated firmly . " Some day all that you write down in your books will be of use . Who else is keeping the record ? " She had a way , most comforting , of making him value himself . " I pray you are right , " he said . " So then , we arc to let him go ? " " Yes , because we can not keep him . " He mused for a moment . " What has happened that the young no longer obey their elders as we did ? " " They see the havoc around about them , " she replied . " They know that we have failed . They no longer respect us. "  |p222She  spoke the cruel words with such calm that he was afraid of her . Then he rose . " You are right . We must let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With that he went to his lonely room and took up his pen to brush the characters of a poem now rising to the surface of his mind . It was strange how these poems came to him nowadays , the distillation of his private emotions , of his disillusionment , of his solitude , of his yearning for a future in which , nevertheless , he could not believe . Nothing now could stay the doom he foresaw for his people and his country . He was surprised that his household could so easily settle itself into a life without the elder son . Peace became its atmosphere , a peace sometimes too deep , Sunia said , for the younger son gave her no trouble. " 1 miss that elder son 's naughty ways , " she told Il-han . " Nothinghappens now that he has gone . Nothing is broken , no wild animals are brought in from the field , the floors are not dirtied , clothes are not torn , shoes are not lost . I hear no complaints about food . I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not making a commotion in the city , " Il-han said . Yet he too was secretly pleased to see Yul-chun once or twice a month when he came home with all his garments soiled and needing to be washed , and with his pockets empty of money . " I daresay you are full of new learning , " I1-han remarked in his dry way . " Your hair wants cutting , " Sunia said briskly , and went to fetch her scissors . Yul-chun shouted after her . " I will not have you cut my hair , Mother ! They 'll say I have a country haircut . " " I will cut it ! " she called back . And cut it she did , holding him by the ears and hooking his head under her arm , he half laughing , half angry . " I will never come home any more if you treat me like this , " he cried while he looked ruefully into the mirror on the wall.  | " Then cut your hair before you come , " she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for money from his father and for love from hey . He still could not do without her tender scolding and teasing love , and he liked to have her examine his clothes and sew on missing buttons and cry how filthy his socks were and how worn his shoes . In short , he needed to know that however far he went away , she was still his mother . And Il-han watched half sadly , and pondered the difference between father love and mother love . With all his teaching and his concern for his son 's mind and character , Yul-chun did not love him as he loved the mother whose concern was all for his body . Body love was deepest of all love perhaps  --  woman love in mother and in wife . Yet was it not this love that kept men forever children ? Though for that matter , how could he himself live without Sunia ? Who would feed him , keep him clean and tended and free of care if he had not her ? In his son he saw himself again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son was in the city , Il-han began in his own way to take more cognizance of the changes in the times . He bade his servant go to the city now and then , not only to observe secretly , but also to see what was new and to listen to talk on the street and in teashops and gathering places . In this way he learned that the Tonghak rebels were growing in number and though they were repressed by the King and his forces , neverthelessthey broke out here and there through the provinces with increasing success . At last their leader was caught and put in prison for execution , and this roused the landfolk to new frenzy and despair . By this time they had no trust in the government , for they saw how the foreign powers pressed upon the King , and they knew how the Queen plotted to keep the Chinese in power in the war that was about to break between China and japan as in mutual anger these two nations quarreled in Korea . In the early spring , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young leader was still in prison , many Tonghak rebels gathered near the capital and they chose forty men from among them as their representatives , and those went to the King facep223to face to ask first that their leader be released and next for measures to better their hard lives . The King was wise enough to meet these Tonghak with courtesy and good promises , and so they returned peacefully to their homes . Yet the King had fresh troubles , for the foreign powers , whose envoys sat in the capital like vultures to watch all he did , were angry because he had received the Tonghak , for among the requests which they made was that he should set up an anti-foreign policy and expel all foreigners from the country . The King was caught between his people and the foreigners and so did nothing . Months passed and when the Tonghak saw that the King did nothing , they rose in greater anger than ever . Twenty thousand came to the town of Pounn pretending to make a religious festival there , but instead they demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from foreign powers alike . Everywhere over the land cries were heard in one city and another . Alas , in the city of Kobu , in the area of Pyonggap , the magistrate outdid all other yangban in corruption , for here he compelled the landfolk to repair the walls of a great reservoir , whose waters were used for irrigating the fields . When these farmers had repaired the reservoir , he levied a heavy tax on the water , which they then used for their fields , and he kept the money for himself . This caused much fury and the landfolk tore down the dam they had repaired , and they stormed into the city and drove the magistrate away from his palace while they occupied the city . The King and his cabinet then sent armies from the capital to rout the rebels , and hearing this from his servant , Il-han sent a man to follow the armies and watch all that took place . The man came back after many days to report that the government forces were overwhelmed and the Tonghak had moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next begged for help from the Chinese , who sent their armies and only then did the rebels retreat against such force . " And , master , " the man said when he had related all this to Il-han , " whom do you think I saw there in the battles ? "  |p225I1-han  knew in his heart and could not speak . " I saw my young master , and he was with his tutor , who lived so many years in your house ! " The servant turned away in pity when he saw Il-han 's face . The times grew still worse . A Chinese army , fifteen hundred strong , with eight field guns , arrived at the Gulf of Asan and marched to the capital . When the Emperor in Japan heard this he sent an army of five thousand soldiers to meet them . There in the Korean capital they went into battle , Chinese and Japanese , and the treaties declaring the independence of Korea became dust . The greater numbers won . Japan drove out the Chinese and then attacked the rebels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Japanese soldiers dragged the Tonghak leader from his prison and put him to death and the rebels in dismay retired into hiding . All this I1-han heard from his several men whom he regularly sent out to bring him news . They spoke no more of the tutor , and Yul-chun came home as usual and said nothing and Il-han said nothing , and in the frightful silence between them , he lived in dread . Now that the Tonghak leader was dead , he knew that indeed the Japanese were in power and the King was dependent upon them for his own place . But what of the Queen ? It was of her he thought . She would never give up her love for the Chinese , and her hatred of the present confusion could only increase her love for them . She would not yield or bend her will . Her proud imperious heart was stubborn with love . Even Sunia grew afraid for her , and she paused near him one day on her way to some household task . " I hope you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let her solve the troubles she has brought upon herself . " He looked up at her quickly . " I am not thinking of the Queen , " he told her and knew he lied . Indeed , why should he think of the Queen ? He could not help her and he would only be blamed if he came out of exile and went to her now . Nor could he keep himself secret if he.  |p225went  . Where the Queen was , nothing was secret . Her every word , her every look , was seen and pondered . Spies surrounded her , and though she was reckless and did what she willed , he who was known as her adviser in the past , if he left his house would be killed somewhere in a side street of the city or in a secret corridor of the palace , and no one would know . He did not lack courage but must he die , he hoped that it could be for a worthy reason and with an effect that lived beyond his death . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his private spies , now increased to eleven men , brought him further reports of the confusions which were taking place . China and Japan , these two , were in constant combat for the prize of his country , its trade , its central position in that part of the world , and the Japanese were carrying the war into China itself , and with every victory they seized new territory . Meanwhile they made this war an excuse for their armies to pour into Korea as reserves , and every day Il-han heard of fresh outrage against his people . ... " The strong have now become too strong , " Il-han 's wise old man servant told him . The day was hot , in the midsummer of that year , and Il-han sat in his white undergarments under a persimmon tree in the garden . The fruit was small and green and the tree was overloadedso that some fruit fell to the ground , and his younger son was throwing the fruit against a target fixed on the trunk of the tree . Il-han watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been waiting for some other nation to see it , " he now said . He clapped his hands as he spoke , for his son had struck the target in the middle . Then he went on speaking . " Yet there may be a benefit for us in the rising jealousy between the nations . None will want to see Japan grow too powerful . " " Ah ha , " the servant said , " you have hit the target , too ! " He came closer and made his voice low . " The Russian Czar today warned the Japanese Emperor through his envoy here that the territories newly seized from China must be restored . "  | " Will it be so ? " Il-han inquired . " Is Japan strong enough to fight Russia ? " the servant asked . " Some day yes , but not yet . That is what I hear said in the streets and in the shops . Japan must yield now but she will hate China the more , and this war will go on . As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waited for his master to speak . Instead Il-han cried out in sudden pain . His son , misjudging distance , had let fly a hard green fruit and it struck Il-han just below the left eye . Il-han pressed his hand to his eye and the boy was overcome with remorse and burst into tears . Sunia came running at the sound of sobbing , and Il-han hastened to explain that he was not blind , that it was a small matter , an accident , but between comfortingthe child and reassuring his wife he did not say what he had been ready to say . When the hubbub was over , his servant was gone and then he was glad he had not said what troubled him so deeply . He knew now that the Queen was doomed . Two days before the mid-autumn festival , in the tenth month of that solar year , Il-han 's spies reported that it was common talk in the streets that the guards in the Queen 's palace were being replaced . Outwardly all was as usual , they told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen said that arms and accouterments were being taken from the palace on the pretense that they were needed elsewhere , and useless weapons were put in their place . The King 's palace was also thus weakened and this at a time when he needed the best defenses . On the afternoon of the seventh day of the festival , one of Il-ban 's spies observed that even the gates and doors of the Queen 's palace seemed to be open and unguarded , and he returned with the news . " Did you speak to anyone of this ? " Il-han demanded . " How could I speak ? " the man replied . " It was seen , but no one cried danger . " " Saddle my horse , " Il-han commanded , and dismissed the man . He would go himself to inquire into what was taking place . Thenp228he considered . Should he tell Sunia or should he not ? Not , he decided . Quietly as a thief he went to his own rooms and changed his clothes to old garments Sunia had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain garments and it was his demand that she should always let him see what she gave away so that he could reclaim what he would not part with . In the midst of this changing he heard her flying feet and the door slid back . " So  --  you think to steal out of the house ! " she cried . " And why do you drag forth those rags which are only fit for beg-gars ? " He looked at her , half rueful , half smiling . " How is it you smell out my least coining and going ? What if I only put on old clothes to go into the garden and  --  plant a tree  --  or  --  " " Make no games with nlc , " she said , coming full into the room . " You never plant trees . Why should you plant one now ? " I le saw that deceit was impossible and he gave way . " Sunia , the Queen is in danger . " She advanced on him . " Is she your concern forever ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She is the concern of every Korean . " The red flew into her cheeks and the fire into her dark eyes . " And why do you think only you can save her ? " she cried . " At least I can see for myself  --  " " See her for yourself , you mean ! " " Sunia ! " " Dare to call my name ! " she cried . " I am no Queen  --  and if you care more for her than you do for us who are your family  --  you have two sons , if you care nothing for a wife , and are they to lose their lives because you hanker for a Queen ? They will be caught and killed , but that does not matter , I suppose , although you will have no more sons from me  --  but you care nothing for that , either , I suppose ! " She was beside herself and he in turn grew angry . He let her rail and in cold silence he drew on the old clothes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low on his face . She ran to the doorway as he came and stood there to preventp229him . He lifted her as though she were a child and set her aside and went on his way , looking neither to the right nor to the left . ... It was late when he arrived at the city gate , but it stood open and unguarded , as though prepared for those who must flee . He passed through , none noticing , and guided his horse to the northern part of the city , where the Queen 's palace stood at the far end of the approach to the royal palaces . This approach was a fine road three hundred feet wide and one third of a mile in length . On both sides stood the ministries of State , some of which he saw were newly built . And new , too , were barracks where Japanese soldiers came and went , marching and countermarching . The palaces were surrounded by a wall twelve feet high and the gates were , as the man said , open and unguarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . He then went through the entrance which was in the western wall and came to the small lake and the foreign house belonging to the King and where he sometimes stayed . The palace where the King lived usually was close by and the Queen 's palace was to the east but adjoining . To the left were the quarters where lived the Royal Guard . This afternoon I1-han saw no guards , but the sun was very hot , and it was possible that some were sleeping inside the palaces . Beyond all these was a pine grove covering some five acres of land . Into this pine grove Il-han now went , and he sat on a rock behind a large leaning pine and waited . If nothing took place , he would return home again without making himself known , but if there was a misfortune he would be there to save the Queen if he could . The King he knew would not be killed for then the succession would be endangered , and the country thrown into swift revolution . Throughout the night he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creaturescame out to creep and call . He heard , or so he thought , the sound of marching and countermarching , but remembering the Japanese guards , he supposed that this was part of their duty . The black hours were passing , he guessed that day was not toop230far away and he was considering whether he should not return again to his horse and reach home before too many people were about the streets when a shout reached his ears . Then he heard screams and cries , and listening with ear to the windward , he knew instantly that the palace was under attack . He ran out into the darkness with all speed but he caught his foot on a root and fell . He got himself up again , although he had wrenched his hip , and he hobbled on . Now the Royal Guards were awake and shouting as they ran toward the palace . He was carried along with them , still hidden by the darkness when they paused , bewilderedand inquiring , only to hear that there was no attack , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries of the Japanese near the western wall . At this the guards went back again to their barracks . Il-han , however , did not return to the pine grove . Instead he hid behind a shrine set in a rock garden . He had not long to wait , for the outcry had roused the Colonel of the Royal Guard , who , distrustingthe commotion among the Japanese soldiers , was already on his way to the Ministry of War . When he reached the main entrance to the palace grounds he was surrounded by the Japanesesoldiers , and Il-han , looking out from behind the rock , saw in the flare of torches that all he had feared was about to happen . Eight shots rang out and the Colonel fell , whereupon the soldiers drew out their swords and cut the dead man to pieces and threw those pieces into the small lake nearby . Now indeed Il-han knew that he must find the Queen and quickly , if he was to save her . He came out from his hiding place and , much hampered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to her palace . Alas , he could make no speed . The Japanese soldiers were pushing forward in a shouting , bellowing , roaring mass , their bayonets pointed ahead of them as they met the fleeing hordes of palace servants . The Royal Guards were once more aroused and they let fly their bullets helter-skelter and killed some seven or eight of the soldiers before they were swept into the mass of others advancing and so cut down . Meanwhile the soldiers pressed on into the Queen'sP231palace , followed by beggars and local ruffians bent on loot . Among these Il-han could hide and he burrowed his way among them , trying by every means to reach the Queen first , though what he could do now to save her he did not know . The mob filled the palace , and the rough soldiers seized every woman by the hair as soon as they saw her , demanding to know whether she was the Queen . Whatever the women said , the soldiersbeheaded them and threw the heads aside or tossed them from a window . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , and now Il-han , pressed among them , heard two shots . Then he heard a low scream and he knew it was the Queen who screamed . The scream ended in a long moaning sigh . He bent his head and bit his lips until he tasted his own blood , but he could do nothing . She was dead . The crowd stopped , men looked at one another , and then one by one they went away , the looters to loot and those who had committed the deed to escape so that none was known to be guilty . When all were gone and only Il-han was left , he went into the room where the Queen lay alone and he looked down into the lovely face he knew so well , still the same lovely face though aged now with the years during which he had not once seen her . He crouched down beside her and took her hand , still warm . Blood flowed from her left breast and from her smooth neck and he lifted the edge of her wide silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crimson and it did not show the stain except that the stuff turned a deeper crimson . So he sat in the empty palace until sunrise and he sat on into the morning until at about the ninth hour a gardener came to the door , barefoot , so that Il-han did not hear his footsteps . He peered in and saw II-han , whom he did not know , so long had Il-han been absent from the palace . " Who are you , brother ? " he asked . " I am her servant , " Il-han said . The man came near and stared down into the pale face of the dead Queen . " She liked white lotus flowers , " he said at last ,
