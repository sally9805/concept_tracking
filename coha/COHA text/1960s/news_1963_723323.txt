txt The average earnings of the nation 's factory workers rose to above $100 a week in June for the first time . The Labor Department also reported today that the number of workers on nonfarm payrolls had continued to increase last month at a better pace than the seasonal expectation . Secretary W. Willard Wirtz hailed the report . He also hailed a report of two weeks ago that employment had exceeded 70 , - 000,000 in June for the first time . He said these were " impressive figures " and declared : " They are not only sources for some satisfaction in themselves ; they are indicative of the continual improvement in the over-all economy . " Notes Jobless Rate But he noted that " the general comfort " implicit in the figures " must not blind us to an unemployment rate that has remained above 5 per cent since November , 1957 , to a youth unemployment rate of 16 per cent that burns with a continuously hotter  --  and shorter ? fuse , and to the heavy and disproportionate burden of unemployment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs of a large segment of our citizenry . " This national unemployment rate in June was 5.7 per cent . The rate among Negroes was about twice that . The record levels of income and employment , Mr. Wirtz said , offer the means to achieve the larger purposes of society . He listed these as full employment , equality of opportunity , elimination of poverty , improvement of educational facilities and opportunities , regeneration of urban areas and development of chronically ailing economic regions . The average weekly earnings of the nation 's 12,500,000 factory production workers are the result of two things ? their average rate of pay and the average number of hours they work , including overtime . The rise last month to the record of $100.61 was from $99.47 in May . This was the result principally of a seasonal increase of three-tenths of an hour in the work week plus a big jump of seven-tenths of an hour between April and May . June 's figure for average weekly hours , including overtime ? at 40.9 ? was a postwar - high for the month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spring of 1962 . Factory overtime rose by twotenths of an hour between May and June to three full hours ? the highest level recorded for the month since the : sureau of Labor Statistics be , - an taking their measure in 1956 . Bureau experts calculate that roughly 10.8 per cent of the average factory worker 's pay now comes to him in the form of premium pay for overtime and holiday work . ' One explanation advanced for this is that the hiring - of new workers has become too expensive because of social insurance costs , pay guarantees and other fringes , and that employers prefer , as long as they are able , to pay overtime rather , than add employes . Average hourly earnings rose only a penny between May and June , to $2.46 . Over the year , average weekly and hourly earnings both were up by 3 per cent . The work week in June of 1962 was 40.7 hours . Although the experts had been expecting for some time that weekly earnings would cross the $100 threshold , the usually phlegmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . The bureau called it " a new milestone in U.S. economic history . " 10 Times Level of 1909 In a special report , thebureau said that factory workers ' gross earnings now were more than 10 times their level in 1909 , when such figures were first compiled . In that year , production workers earned a little under $10 for a 51 hour week . By 1919 , they were making $22 and accounted for 32 per cent of all employes on nonfarm payrolls . Now , they account for 22 per cent ? a reflection of the changing nature of work and technology . Earnings passed the $25 mark in 1920 , hovered between $21 and $26 until the depression , then plunged to less than $15 in March of 1933 . Recovery was slow . Earnings did not reach $25 again until 1940 . They nearly doubled during World War II , reaching $47 in late 1944 . A brief drop in the early postwar period was followed by a rise to $50 in 1947 and a rapid increase to $75 eight years later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases in prices in the last half century has meant that the real gain was a good deal less than the apparent one . In 1914 , earnings averaged $10.92 , one-ninth of the current level . But when adjusted for price changes the " real " earnings in 1914 were a third of today 's level . Furthermore , in the last 20 years , deductions for Federal income taxes . and Social Security have been of growing importance . Until 1943 , the worker 's gross earnings were a pretty good measure of what he actually got . Since then the disparity has been growing . In 1947 , a worker with three dependents averaged $49.17 a week and took home $47.58 . In June of this year he mad ( $100.61 , but took home $88.38 After adjustment for pric ( changes , the worker 's takehome pay rose about a thirc between 1947 and now .
