At first glance , the tiny exhibit at the National Cash Register Co. ' s pavilion at the New York World 's Fair seems singularly insignificant . But the sheet of transparent plastic , less than 2 in. square , is covered closely with 1,240 barely visible rectangles . And when examined with a microscope , each tiny rectangle spreads out into a page of the Bible . Both the Old and New Testament - all 773,746 words of the King James Version - are all clearly recorded on that one slip of plastic . The job took only four hours . <P> The Bible was reproduced by what Bob Chollar , the company 's head of research , calls photochromic micro images , or PCMI . The film has none of the silver halide grains that are the vital element in conventional photographic film ; instead there is a very thin layer of a dye that darkens rapidly when exposed to ultraviolet light . The resulting picture has no " grain . " Images of Bible pages projected in ultraviolet were reduced by lenses and focused one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film was moved mechanically to array the tiny pages in close-packed rows . This miracle of miniaturization , which makes the traditional Lord 's Prayer engraved on a pinhead seem downright brobdingnagian , can cram 1,000,000 book pages on a stack of 3-in. by 5-in. index cards about 4 in. high . It could pack all the books in the Library of Congress into six ordinary filing cabinets . To read one of these literary slides , a viewer can use a device similar to a microscope , or the material can be projected in standard page-size on a translucent screen . <P> While hailing the miniaturizing ability of PCMI , the company 's scientists think it has another talent that is even more important . Records made by ultraviolet light are easily correctable . When the recording operator or one of his machines makes an inevitable mistake , the unwanted page can be erased by one quick flash of yellow light . A new page can be printed by ultraviolet in the same place . The observer can watch both erasure and printing in green light , which does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally complete , with all its million pages of print in the desired places , it can be made permanent by a secret process that makes it insensitive to light of any color .
