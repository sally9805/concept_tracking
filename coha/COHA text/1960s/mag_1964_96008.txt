Someday someone is going to play the perfect round of golf . It will happen in about the same year that they discover a politician or a taxi driver who is n't on the hustle , or a shoelace that does n't break when you are in a hurry . Until that perfect game of golf is played , the 18 holes that Ben Hogan turned in from tee to green in Houston the other day will have to do . Playing against Sam Snead in a TV exhibition called Shell 's Wonderful World of Golf , Hogan hit 35 shots about as well as they could be hit . He also stroked 34 putts like a man with an advanced case of Parkinson 's disease for a final score of 69 and a three-stroke victory over Snead . When it was all over , Gene Sarazen , who narrates the show for the Shell Oil Company , said , " Ben , from tee to green that is the finest round of golf that has been played in my lifetime . " For reference , Sarazen won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about anyone else alive could have said the same thing as Sarazen . Throughout the entire 18 holes , Hogan never hit a shot more than 10 feet off the line of flight he intended it to travel . He never once hit the ball into the rough or a hazard . On all 18 greens , he was putting for either a birdie or an eagle . If someone like Arnold Palmer or Billy Casper had been putting for him , he might well have scored in the 50s. // In these days when promoters outnumber sand traps , visions of a last great Snead-Hogan confrontation had been dancing in many a restless noggin . To any golf fan past the age of 35 it would be a kind of dream match , although the younger generation might rate its excitement potential on a par with a Norma Talmadge love scene . Nonetheless , these two ancients , each of whom is 52 this year , still give the current champions some uncomfortable moments in the few tournaments they enter . // The match was finally put together by Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranging such sporting climaxes . He caught up with Hogan in April at the Masters , where Ben had shot a brilliant third-round 67 and finished in a tie for ninth . Knowing that Hogan was then feeling fairly sanguine about his putting after a decade of yips , Corcoran persuaded him to give a TV match some thought . When Hogan eventually agreed , it marked his first venture into the business of televised matches  --  he had long avoided them . // Snead had played in many  --  perhaps more than any other golfer . All he asked was a chance to get in a practice round before the match . To make that possible , a Houston industrialist named Pierre Schlumberger ( pronounced shlumbarejay ) sent his company jet to pick up Snead at his home club of Greenbrier in West Virginia on a Sunday morning . That afternoon , Sam was out on the Houston Country Club course firing five and six balls on every hole from every position . Hogan was also on the course , as he had been for the previous two days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjacent holes , they did not even nod . They have never been particularly fond of each other . // The blunt fact is that two more antithetical types than Hogan and Snead could hardly exist . At the apex of his career , Hogan was about as convivial as a Trappist monk . He conquered golf with willpower , forcing his slight physique to its utmost . Snead was the carefree hillbilly , everybody 's pal , a kind of Will Rogers of the fairways with his homey wit and hayseed yarns . The only thing the two men had in common was a total commitment to golf . // Snead and Hogan met in head-to-head matches  --  exclusive of team matches  --  only three times in their long and parallel careers , and Snead won them all . The first was in San Francisco in 1941 , where Snead had a 66 to Hogan 's 68 . The next was a playoff at the 1950 Los Angeles Open , an event that marked Hogan 's return to competition after an automobile accident that nearly took his life 11 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masters they tied again after 72 holes , and Snead won again , 70-71 . Hogan 's supporters maintain that these were not true tests because Hogan must prepare himself mentally for a match , and once the four rounds are finished he has trouble cranking himself up for an epilogue . Put a club in Snead 's hands , and he could hit the ball perfectly in the middle of Times Square on New Year 's Eve . // As recently as 1962 , Snead wrote in a book , " All I know is that it 's true that Hogan and Byron Nelson won plenty of tournaments which I did n't , but any time Hogan and I met in a head-to-head playoff , I won . We met three times over the years when we were rivals . The score reads : Snead 3 , Hogan 0 . " // Be all that as it may , the Houston match had the feeling of a final showdown . It began on Monday morning under ugly skies . As the two golfers warmed up on the practice tee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trademark  --  Hogan in his white linen cap , Snead in his coconut straw hat . Hogan looked superbly fit , albeit a few pounds heavier than imagination and memory would have it . Snead , on the other hand , was beginning to overlap his trouser tops a bit . // When all the cameras were in position , Associate Producer and Commentator George Rogers gave a short speech through a portable electric megaphone to the several hundred club members who had showed up for the start of the match . He told them that a considerable amount of prestige and money was involved and please not to click their cameras while the players were hitting the ball . Then he introduced the contestants as if they were boxers : " Visiting from White Sulphur Springs , W. Va .  --  Sam Snead . And Texas ' own Ben Hogan. " // Lee Sholem , the director of the show , explained some of the ground rules of TV golf . When he gave the signal for the action to begin , the player hitting first was to select his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the forecaddies in orange coveralls would run out on the fairway and mark the position where the ball had come to rest . Only then could the other player select his club from the bag and make his shot . // " Do we have to do that on every hole ? " Hogan asked . // " Yes , " said the director . // " Whew ! " said Hogan. // " By the 18th , you 'll get used to it , " the director told him . Hogan looked unconvinced . // The sound man blew his whistle , and the director beckoned to Hogan to begin play . Ben drew his driver out of his bag , said " We 're off and running , " teed up the ball and sent a perfect shot whistling far down the fairway . The gallery applauded . Next , Snead hit a drive with a slight draw on it , and it rolled 10 yards past Hogan 's ball to the left side of the fairway . The gallery applauded again . // Out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras were unloaded from golf carts and regrouped near the balls . Farther down the fairway at the back edge of the green were a couple of trees that must have come from Burn-ham Wood , for they had not been there moments earlier . Peering through the branches of these trees were additional cameras . When all was ready , Hogan hit a lovely six-iron some nine feet to the right of the pin . Sam 's seven-iron was 20 feet to the left . // The gallery now walked to the green , waited another 10 minutes for the cameras and watched as both men got their pars . The traveling trees went careening down the 2nd fairway like drunks on the town . As Hogan waited to drive off the 2nd tee , he looked at Snead 's clubs and said , " Sam , I see you 've got a new driver . " // " Yeah , " said Snead . " Since ' 57. " // Hogan hit a virtually perfect drive . " Too far to the right , " he said with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snead . " Two feet . " // Snead punctuated this comment by hitting his drive 30 yards past Hogan's. // Hogan used a three-iron for his second shot , and all the way it looked as if it might hit the flagstick , but it rolled 20 feet past . Snead pulled a six-iron slightly , and it stopped on the frog hair to the left of the green , but he got his par as did Hogan . Rain had begun to fall , hesitantly at first , during the half an hour consumed at the 2nd hole , but it came down in earnest as the two men finished putting . Everyone stood around under umbrellas , and the setting reminded one of the cemetery scene in Our Town . At last there was a letup , although thunder and lightning rumbled and crackled overhead . Hogan sent a fine drive down the middle of the 3rd fairway , a 510-yard dogleg right . Snead followed with an enormous drive over the bunker that guards the elbow of the fairway . By the time they reached their balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so everyone stampeded for the clubhouse . It was 10:30 in the morning , and only two holes had been completed . // Hogan and Snead waited in the golf shop for awhile , and someone reminded Sam that he was now facing the only three things he feared in life . " Remember , Sam ? " the man asked . " Remember , you said one time that the only things you were scared of were lightning , aside-hill putt and Ben Hogan. " // " Ah nev ' said that , " Snead drawled . " Mah old pal , Porky Oliver , made that up . " Snead likes to think there is no man in golf who can take him when he is right . In his book , he had written , " After a quarter century of swinging , I 'm not afraid to meet any man in the world in a head-to-head match , and that 's because I 've never let outside business turn me soft and paunchy . My measurements are almost the same as 20 years ago  --  185 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The players moved inside the clubhouse for lunch , and afterward Snead took a nap in the steam room while Hogan sat with his wife , Valerie , and their friends . By 2:30 the rain began to ease off , and the producers decided to resume play . // When the golfers got back to the 3rd hole the gallery had grown to a thousand or so . Hogan 's ball lay in the middle of the fairway , where he had left it four hours earlier . After such a long and frustrating delay , it hardly seemed likely that he could continue such precise golf as he had played in the morning , but once the cameras were turning again he struck a perfect three-wood to the green some 25 feet short of the pin . Snead. whose ball was 40 yards past Hogan 's , hit a four-iron to the green , but he was 40 feet short . Both two-putted for birdie 4s , putting them one under par . // At the 4th hole , a moderate par 3 , Hogan three-putted from 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back even with par and a stroke behind Snead . He looked grim , a look that sent chills up the spines of his fellow golfers 10 or 15 years ago , and he got the stroke back with a birdie on 5 . They halved the 6th hole in par , and at the 7th , Snead decided to gamble . This crescent-shaped par 4 is only 300 yards long , and the direct line from tee to green is over a high stand of timber . Hogan hit an iron straight down the fairway , but Snead decided to try to hit his tee shot over the tall trees to the green . It was a mistake . His drive struck a tree and rebounded to within 150 yards of the tee . Now his only shot to the green was to thread the ball through the woods , and he tried it with a five-iron , hooding the club to keep the ball low . Luck alone guided the ball safely through the thick foliage , and it stopped just off the green . From there , Snead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , Sam could have had a 10 . Hogan 's par was routine . // It was now close to 5 o'clock , and the light was getting too dim for color film , so the match was adjourned until Tuesday morning at 8 . The players were all even so far at one under par , and each was in a comfortable frame of mind . Snead made light of his only two errors , then thought awhile and added , " Ben 's playing very well . " // Hogan said , " I 'm hitting the ball as well as I know how . " And he had the right word for his putting . He called it " a disgrace . " // The next day was a beauty  --  not a cloud and an amiable breeze to take the scorch out of the Texas sun . The players finished the first 9 in par , and by then Hogan told Sarazen , " Those putts scare me to death . If it keeps up , I 'm going to have to quit playing golf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrocious . His head was swaying forward as he stroked the ball , and he was sweeping at it with his arms like any Sunday hacker . When his Bullseye putter struck the ball there was a dull thunk as if the clubhead were made of wood . Even so , Ben was in a remarkably serene mood . He had adjusted his game to the slow tempo demanded by the cameras and seemed far less impatient than Snead. // The first really wild shot of the match came when Snead sliced his drive into an adjoining fairway on the 11th . He scrambled back for his par , and going down the 12th fairway he said to a friend , " This would be a very dull match if it were n't for me . Everything would just be straight down the middle . " // At the 12th hole , a 570-yard par 5 , Hogan hit a superb nine-iron approach from a downhill lie on the fairway to within 10 feet of the pin and sank the putt for a birdie 4 . A great big smile lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his birdie , and Hogan took the lead for the first time . Ben missed an eight-foot putt for a birdie at 13 , but he picked up another stroke when Snead three-putted the 14th green . At the 15th , Ben sank another eight-footer for a birdie 3 , building his lead to three strokes . Even so , the strain of the long day was getting to him . " I 'll never do one of these again , " he said to no one in particular as he waited at the 16th tee . // It was getting past noon , and the question came up as to whether they would break for lunch or finish the match and then eat . Director Sholem decided to continue . " We have never played a match on this show that went so smoothly , " he said . " With golfers like this , there is no problem . They hit the ball so perfectly that we can get both their shots with one setup most of the time . Just think , not once have we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two holes an hour . It 's incredible . " // The match was running out on Snead . They set off down the 17th with Hogan still holding a three-stroke lead and hitting every shot as if it were on a string from the tee to the hole . In the middle of the 17th fairway , Hogan made a joke with Director Sholem before hitting his second shot , and Fred Corcoran , watching from the sidelines , said , " School 's out . Ben just laughed . " Snead then hit a gorgeous nine-iron to the 17th green , and it floated down like a feather only six feet from the hole . He sank the putt for a birdie 4 , leaving him only two down as the players headed for 18 . The deficit was not insurmountable . Hogan , stopping to chat with a friend on the 17th green , said , " Want to trade a set of nerves ? I 'll trade anyone , sight unseen . " // Snead had just about given up , though . Standing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director Sholem inquired politely if anything out there on the fairway bothered him . " Only thing bothers me is catching that plane this afternoon so I can get a little farther up north , " he said . // " What are you complaining about ? " a man in the gallery called out . " We have to live down here . " // That made Sam smile , and he began telling some of the people around the 18th tee about the charms of West Virginia . " There 's a cool breeze comes up the valley , " he said , " and them deer walk right past your house , and all you got to do is get you a little .22 and  --  phttt  --  you got your dinner . " // " I 've been contributing to you , " said one of the gallery . " I just bought a set of your woods . " // " Send them to me , " Sam answered . " Mine ai n't working so good . Now , if the good Lord would just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be all right . " // It was Snead 's turn to drive first , and he creased the middle of the fairway with a screamer . Then , as he sometimes does when things are not going well for him , he walked off the tee , climbed into a golf cart and started up the fairway before Hogan had hit his shot . It is a form of rudeness that fails to endear Snead to his competitors . // Hogan pursed his lips and hit a drive that was even beyond Snead 's  --  and just as straight . He was showing he could drive the ball as far as Snead if he really cared to . // Snead had to get down in two from where his ball lay on the fairway if he had any hope of gaining a tie , and even then Hogan would have to three-putt . Sam hit a six-iron to the green , but he pushed it wide to the right , and he was 12 inches short with the 30-foot putt he needed for a birdie . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hogan two-putted for his 69. // Afterward in the locker room , Snead told the handful of sportswriters who had followed the match , " The 72 was n't so bad , but I did n't hit the ball well . My irons just were n't any good . I changed my irons and played with this new set I just got from the factory , and I only had a couple of practice rounds with them at Greenbrier before I came down here . But that 's as well as I 've ever seen Ben play  --  from tee to green . " // Hogan echoed the thought a few minutes later . " That 's as good as I can play , " he said . " But it was just like going through the miseries of hell out there on the greens . I thought I had been putting pretty well for the last few months , and I thought maybe I might have that thing licked , but it was terrible . I was planning to play some of the tournaments this summer  --  I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . There 's not much point to it if I ca n't putt . " // Be that as it may , Ben Hogan had proven that he could beat Sam Snead head-to-head . Unfortunately , it was for nothing more valuable than the $3,000 winner 's share of a $5,000 purse and the championship of some ephemeral TV hour next winter . Oh yes , for one other thing , too : for the pride of an always proud athlete .
