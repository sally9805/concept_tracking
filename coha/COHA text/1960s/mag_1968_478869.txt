The arts have a way of spawning organizations , societies , federations. and enclaves of the devoted with all the zest and some of the mumbo jumbo and slogans of the fraternal organizations that are so much a part of the American community . I backed into such an organization recently more or less by accident in a friend 's living room in Salisbury , Connecticut . I asked an innocent enough question , " Tell me about your film society . How does it work ? " and in a few days I found myself buried under a pile of literature and deep in conversation in New York with the Executive Secretary of the American Federation of Film Societies , of which he said there are some 2,500 in this country with heaven knows how many members . Do not for a moment think that this is merely an organized lot of movie buffs ; on the contrary , it is a deadly serious business for deadly serious lovers of the cinema . About fifteen years ago I was spending a weekend in Salisbury with Robert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I remember , to the town library and looked at a film projected by a sixteen-millimeter machine in the library 's main meeting room ; we sat on hard wooden folding chairs . This was not a regular meeting of the local film society , of which Mrs. Osborn isthe originator and moving spirit and master intelligence , but was merely an occasion for her to take a look at a film to see whether it was up to the standards she sets for the Salisbury Film Society . Curiously , and not to my credit , / remember the chairs but I can not remember the film , and I am inclined to think of members of film societies as hard-chair devotees of the art of the cinema , though 1 have recently learned that this notion of the primitive state of this movement is now quite out-of-date . The kind of film society Mrs. Osborn runs is a rather rare kind today though it was the sort that started the movement . Its membership is now limited to thirty and there is a long list of applicants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with white-columned houses and tall elms and wide lawns , who are waiting for present members to yield their places for one reason or another . " It is very important , " Mrs. Osborn told me , " that this group be kept small and congenial so that people know each other and have a chance to discuss what they have seen . Some of them have been members since we started in 1951 , and by now they have a tremendous backlog of experience with film . " Mrs. Osborn gave me a copy of a small paperback book called Film Society Primer which was published twelve years ago when the movement was still young , and it contains a chapter written by her about the origins and early programs of the Salisbury society . It was not the initial intention of the society " to study the history of the film as an art , " as Mrs. Osborn put it , but it was established " with an honest desire to make this a vehicle for bringing all kinds of outstanding films to the community . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't a great deal going on in Salisbury at that time to relieve the long cold winters . Salisbury , a town of about 2,000 voters , has two private boarding schools for boys ( and hence an unusual supply of teachers ) and a number of painters , writers , and other professionals , some of them retired . The fare offered by the local movie house was the routine fare and routinely unappetizing to the fussier ( if that is the word ) members of the community . The first offering of the society ( 149 people had joined on faith ) lasted from eight until nearly midnight and included Edwin S. Porter 's Dream of a Rarebit Fiend , Harold Lloyd in High and Dizzy , Buster Kea-ton 's The Navigator , and as if that were n't enough to shake the audience loose from its senses , there was also W. C. Fields in Never Give a Sucker 25 AFTER HOURS an Even Break . The subscribers , Mrs. Osborn said , " were in agony from sustained laughter long before the lens began to fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that session , hundreds of films have been exposed to the eyes of the sophisticated in Salisbury ? films from Europe and Asia , from the archives of early film history , from the newest experiments , from mass culture and mini culture . The local theater , somewhat put out by the fact that the number of members of the film society exceeded the total of its usual audience , joined forces with the society for a short interval . There were technical difficulties which made the showing of sixteen-millimeter films a nuisance to the theater ( " New foreign films , " Mrs. Osborn explained , " were available on thirty-five-millimeter , but not the classics , and there were almost no interesting shorts , documentaries , or experimental films except on sixteen-millimeter " ) . There were other troubles having to do , as I understand it , with diluting the strength of the aesthetic brew to which the hard-chair members were accustomed . So the membership shrank to what eventually became living-room size ... indeed the Osborns ' living room , from the ceiling of which hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one bright red . It now meets elsewhere , however , in a barn-like addition to a house in Salisbury . It was in the Osborns ' living room , where the sun poured in through a glass wall , that Mrs. Osborn told me about film societies . Since she first became involved with them , they have become , if by no means a part of mass culture , something far more than an arcane pastime for the few . " Feature films can be rented , " she said . " for as little as seventeen to twenty dollars for certain old classics . New things often are as much as seventy-five , but the average in our budget is about fifty to sixty dollars per program including shorts . We charge our members sixteen dollars for a series of eight programs and we just about break even ; our total budget for the year runs to about five hundred dollars . College film societies are a quite different matter ; they charge five dollars for a series ? but then they have hundreds of subscribers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly typical of local , non-campus societies in its origins and the nature of its membership . Such societies grow rapidly out of the enthusiasm of a very small group and then settle down after a season or two to meetings of those who are genuinely concerned with what they consider ( and they are probably right ) the most important art form of our time . I asked Mrs. Osborn what kinds of people these were in Salisbury . " We have some young people and wish we had room for more , " she said , " and as you would expect a number of history and English and art teachers and , of course , writers . Lewis Mum-ford used to come quite regularly when he was living in Anienia , and so did Lewis Gannett until he died . The local superintendent of schools has been a member for ten years . " One impact of the society on the community has been a greatly increased use of film in local schools . " Teachers who are members see the possibilities of using film , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary run-of-the-mill educational films but films that supplement history teaching , for instance , All Quiet on the Western Front , Battle of the Rails , and Triumph of the Will . Some teachers have started film societies in high schools in the vicinity , and last year I was invited to speak at a meeting of all the art supervisors of the Connecticut public schools . I showed them samples of experimental films , documentaries , newsreels , and so on to give them some idea of the scope of films and how they might use them . " It is not enough for the members of film societies merely to let the foreign , the famous , the historical , the experimental , the documentary , and the art movies pass before their increasingly knowing and critical eyes ; they are instructed in the nature of how to look and what to look for . Program notes are almost as much a part of the ritual as the films themselves ; they describe the special qualities and histories of the films on the progra.rn with information about directors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraisals and comparisons with other films and suggestions for what particular qualities of technique to watch for . " This kind of viewing , " AFTER HOURS Mrs. Osborn said , " produces more discriminating audiences . They may still want to see Bonnie and Clyde at the local theater , but they shy away from How to Stuff a Wild Bikini . Our members now look for films by such directors as Fellini , Antonioni , Satyajit Ray , Godard , Truffaut , and many others whose features they first saw in Salisbury . " I asked Mrs. Osborn how she selected the films for her society , and she told me that the membership has a strong voice in what it wants to see and that she spends a great deal of time at screenings that are put on in New York especially for film society programmers , at the so-called film festivals , and at week-long meetings such as the International Film Seminars , where she said , " We look at films in the Flaherty spirit ? documentaries and feature films of significance ? and at new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we call them , have been at Arden House ; " this year they 'll be at Windham College in Vermont . The people who come are filmmakers , librarians ( film librarians , that is ) , producers , and many students . . . about a hundred in all . There are a lot of people there who teach film ? courses in the history and aesthetics of the film . Harvard as yet has no such course . Yale started one last year . Most college courses in film are how-to-do-it , like the ones at UCLA , Northwestern , NYU , and Boston University . Dartmouth has courses of all kinds . " Some years ago when Mrs. Osborn was Elodie Courter , she originated and ran the first circulating art exhibitions for the Museum of Modern Art in New York , and she has known and been close to the workings of that Museum 's film library from its inception . It is still , in her estimation , the very best source for films for film societies , though she mentioned a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , which she finds especially helpful ? Contemporary Films , Inc. , Brandon Films , Inc. , and the Audio Film Center . " In the last three or four years , " *Arden House , formerly the estate of the Averell Harriman family at Harriman , New York , is now part of Columbia University and is used for conferences of many different kinds.she said , " a lot of new libraries have sprung up . There 's an enormous audience for the art film . " She went to a cabinet in her library and came back with a stack of catalogues a foot high . " See what I mean ? " she said . Tee following week I learned to my surprise that the kind of film society that graces Salisbury is a drop in the cinematic bucket . Ninety-five per cent of film societies are in schools and on college campuses , or so I was assured by William A. Starr , the Executive Secretary of the American Federation of Film Societies , an organization of which Mrs. Osborn was at one time the Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one at the University of Nebraska probably has the most members ( 2,000 students and 800 " townies " ) , and the most active is the one at Dartmouth . " There is a film every day of the week at Dartmouth , " Mr. Starr said , " and there are a thousand members of the film society . " The first university to take the films seriously was the University of Southern California , which still has the largest movie department of all educational institutions in the country . It was started in 1932 as a center to prepare students for the movie industry , and the emphasis of the courses was ( and still is1 on production ; aesthetics , history , and the social implications of film were tangential to job training . There are now many colleges that offer a course or two in what might be called film connoisseurship . Mr. Starr gave me an article by Jack C. Ellis of Northwestern , who has been chairman of the American Federation of Film Societies , in which he says , " Film is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of providing uniquely important aesthetic experience for the viewer and a flexible and potentially eloquent means of self-expression for the creator . " Film-appreciation *Figures about film societies are mysterious . In the literature I have been given the number of societies is variously stated as anywhere from 2,000 to 4,000 . One authority says there are about 800 college film societis , and another says that most of the 4,000 are " on ox near a college campus . " AFTER HOURS courses , in other words , are a little better off than art-appreciation courses were when Charles Eliot Norton introduced the history of art at Harvard in the 1870s . The visual arts , it seems , have always had a difficult time fighting their way into the curriculum as respectable disciplines . " We are trying to make an impact on American society , " Mr. Starr said as though he had said it often before to audiences larger than one . " There is an increasing group concerned with the cinema 's not living up to its potential . " He said something about " substantive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained to me the difference between cinema , film , and movies . Cinema is an art ; film , is the generic term that covers pictures that move ; movies mean entertainment ; and all three put together constitute " a medium of education , communication , and art . " To me the most surprising revelation that Mr. Starr made was that a low-budget ( $40,000 to $50,000 ) film can , if it is interesting enough , make a profit entirely from rentals to film societies without ever being shown in a commercial theater . I asked Mr. Starr what the effect of film societies had been on the proliferation of " art film " houses . Fifteen years ago in New York there were just three or four which struggled for existence , now there are dozens with long queues waiting to get in to see foreign and experimental and historically important films . He was , not surprisingly , unable to be specific in his answer , but he believes the impact has been considerable . " There have been many thousands of young people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been raised , " he said . In some respects film societies verge on big business . A piece by Vincent Canby in the New York Times in February said that " film lirectors ? especially the avant-garde , ' ar-out ( or far-under ) types ? have iecorne extremely valuable commodiies on the lecture trails , particularly hose trails that lead through univerity campuses . " Jean-Luc Godard , he French director , was scheduled to ? cture at eighteen campuses this pring at fees up to $1,500 , though e quit after going to only five . Other moviemakers were traveling from campus to campus showing their films and lecturing and in addition to lecture fees were getting a percentage of the gate . Andy Warhol , who in his younger days of relative obscurity used to draw illustrations for this magazine ( he is now the high potentate of Pop art and " master of the underground cinema " ) , was also booked to lecture at colleges . He sent an actor in his place , however , because , as Canby said in the Times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Warhol felt it might be better to send out someone who was more entertaining . ' " To Mr. Starr , however , there is something far more important than the size to which film societies have grown . He sees in them the future of the art of cinema because , he says , " We know that it is only a matter of time before the students who have been brought up in the film societies will be the makers of tomorrow 's cinema . The trouble with most traditional filmmakers has always been that they are not cultivated men . " It would be interesting to speculate , too , about the extent to which film societies like Mrs. Osborn 's in Salisbury , the one at Dartmouth and the several thousand elsewhere , organized con amore , inspired through the Federation of Film Societies , the creation of the American Film Institute , a nongovernmental organization that has received generous support from the federal government 's arts program . A year ago it set aside $1,210,000 to collect and preserve classic American movies that threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last January it put up $500,000 for a program to help student and independent filmmakers to make short films , and just recently it has offered to help finance commercial distribution of worthy new films made in the United States with relatively low budgets . It takes a great deal of pressure to make this kind of intelligent patronage befall any of the arts . It is the members of the film societies , I suspect , once a hard-chair and now a hard-core constituency of deeply concerned enthusiasts , that has brought about this near miracle of cooperation between government and industry for the benefit of the fastidious .
