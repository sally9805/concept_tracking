When he set out to revamp high school physics in 1956 , M.I.T. Physicist Jerrold Zacharias sparked a chain reaction of reform that is beginning to push all U.S. education toward dramatically new ways of learning . <P> Zacharias ' M.I.T.-sponsored Physical Science Study Committee used a simple principle : it got top university scholars to reinterest themselves in high schools , after decades of leaving such tasks as textbook writing to standpat educationists . University physicists , knowing the basic unity of their subject , were shocked at the bits-and-pieces approach of high school texts , and devised a thematic course now used by 30% of all high school physics students . The example was so appealing that other university scholars plunged into other school subjects . Now , math , biology , chemistry , foreign languages and even English are all bubbling with more new ideas than U.S. schools have ever seen at one time . <P> " Discovery . " Zacharias ' committee soon became a nonprofit corporation : Educational Services Inc . At its headquarters in Watertown , Mass. , scholars and schoolmen joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paperback books , such cheap props as ping-pong balls and drinking straws . E.S.I. has gone on not only to launch summer teacher-training institutes , but also to rewrite U.S. engineering courses and elementary-school science . Last week the Ford Foundation handed over $1,000,000 to help E.S.I , surge ahead on all fronts . Its most ambitious plan yet : revitalizing the teaching of humanities , notably history and social studies . What Ford is paying for , says James Killian Jr. , chairman of the M.I.T. Corporation ( and of E.S.I. 's trustees ) , is " the most exciting advance in American education today . " <P> Humanities may prove a lot tougher to help than science . The key idea in " new " math and physics is " discovery " : rather than memorizing Newton 's laws of motion , for example , students are led through experiments to conclude that the laws exist . But history is a can of worms : its " truths " tend to be value judgments , not physical facts . However much a superb teacher leads a student to true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly subjective . <P> " Postholing . " Nonetheless , E.S.I. 's innovators can not help improving the dead-fact history taught in so many U.S. schools , teaching that ignores the new insights of anthropology , sociology , economics , psychology . Last summer , E.S.I , scholars in such fields met to mull ideas that boil down to one main approach : use all the new scholarly tools for probing deeply ( " postholing " ) into one specific situation , rather than skimming over great hunks of history at a time . As M.I.T. Historian Elting Morison , editor of Theodore Roosevelt 's letters and a key E.S.I. scholar , put it : " It may be that a student can learn more about American Government by studying original materials to reconstruct a single case-say , the events surrounding the building of the battleship Kentucky in 1900-than by reading all the civics books in print .
