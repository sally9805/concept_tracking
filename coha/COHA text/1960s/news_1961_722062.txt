txt President de Gaulle threatened tonight to dissolve Parliament and reassume dictatorial powers if necessary to carry through his domestic and international policies . In a television and radio addres : , to the nation , the Frenen President restated his determination to bring Algeria to independence through negotiation with the Moslem rebel ; ? and through self-determination . Ile also eNpressed his strong resi.:La ! V:e to any cOliCc. ; : iioris to Sovict . Union an the Berlin and his defiance of the old-line pa politicians challenzina Ins rule . Algeria Plan Confirmed lie confirmed earlier reports of his intention to set up a prri.:i , . ional Algerian executive body to form immediately an Algerian military force to carry out the provisional executives orders and preparatiens for a self-determination referendum . ' At the same time , he renewed his offer to the rebel Algerian Provisional Govern-1 ment to negotiate terms of ; peace and Algerian independ-1 ence with safeguards for the ; interests of the European mi- ; nority in Algeria . He sought to parry both the threat of new subversive action by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secret Armed Organization  --  and the mounting legal opposition by old-line politicians under such leaders as former Premiers Pierre Dr.endes-France and Guy Mollet . Army Given Tribute The President tried to separate the Algerian subversive elements from their essential army support by paying tribute to the " victory " won by the army against the Moslem rebels in Algeria . With more optimism than most observers here can muster , the President added : " Finally , at the risk of collapse . it was and still is necessary that , despite . the repeated incitements to disobey and to desert tendered by those who went astray , the army remains , then as well as now , attached to its duty . It did so then : it is doing so now . All honor to it . " General de Gaulle adopted a sterner tope toward the civilian politicians who have begun clamoring for replacement of the Gaullist regime by a coalition of party politicians . This was the theme voiced a week ago by M. Mendes-France , now a member of the dissident Socialist party . Appealing directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint in // every recent electoral test , General de Gaulle recalled the near chaos to which the party system had brought France in May , 1958 , when he was returned to power to ward off the threat of civil war . " But what judgment , " he asked , " should be rendered with regard to the partisans of the former system who would exploit the public concerns in order to attempt to bring the Republic back to certain games that we know of ; in the name of what force , what virtue , what efficient means would they raise their claims ? " Since everyone is aware of the brink on which the country and the Republic were tottering three years ago ; since no one ? including those very partisans ? doubts that the affairs of this century are too difficult for today 's maneuvers ; since one can be convinced that if these men were to succeed , by miracle , in restoring their regime momentarily , the extreme political factions would soon engulf them and destroy the country . " Intentions Clear Making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say : " If it so happened that the political situation were to jeopardize the regular functioning of the powers  --  government and Parliament ? and thereby , in these threatening times , the very fate of the country , the people would have to make themselves heard through the means available to them . And then , in case of public danger , it would he incumbent upon me , as is known , to take all the measures demanded by the circumstances . " This was a clear threat to dissolve Parliament and call for new elections in which President de Gaulle would presumably bring all of his prestige and influence to bear to promote the election of Deputies favorable to his policies . It was a threat that might overawe the Deputies about to reassemble tomorrow for a new session , but which would certainly tend to increase their resentment of General de Gaulle 's dominant position . Civil War Threat Seen M. ' Mendes-France based his appeal for a party coalition to replace General de Gaulle on the contention that the Presi. dent 's one-man rule had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forces of the army and civilian extremists opposed to Algerian independence . General de Gaulle turned this argument around and tonight contended that the restoration of the " parliamentary games " of the Fourth Republic would offer an opportunity to the " activist extremes " to " submerge and rend the country . " This was his promise to reassume , if necessary , the dictatorial powers available to him under Article 16 of the Constitution of the Fifth Republic . General de Gaulle availed himself of these powers during the army mutiny in Algeria in April . He employed them for five months to purge subversive elements in the army and civilian administrations , to intern suspected extremists and to decree laws for the safeguard of the Republic . - But this legalized dictatorship vastly accelerated the political opposition to the President and he voluntarily laid down his powers , effective Oct. 1 . Guarantee Remains " It was possible this time to apply this special provision ? which operated effectively at the time of the events last April ? to a limited field and , since the alarm appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discontinue the application of this special provision as of yesterday , " he said . " But it remains , nevertheless , in its fullest extent , the supreme guarantee of the country and of the State . " On Algeria and the international crisis over Berlin , General de Gaulle had little new to say . But he tied both of them closely to the maintenance of domestic , peace and order  --  that is , the ! Gaullist regime ? in France . He sought to turn the Euro-I pean population of Algeria away , from its allegiance to the ex tremist forces . " We solemnly call upon the French people in Algeria , whatever their regrets for an ei , a , that is over , to stand by France , to give forthright assistance to the birth of a new Algeria , of the kind that France desires , that is , one in which the French will have their rightful place , " he said .                   @ @
