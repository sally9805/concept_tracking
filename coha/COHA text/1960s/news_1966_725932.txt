txt Cape Kennedy , Fla. , Nov. 15 Tuesday ? Spacecraft troubles interrupted the sleep of the Gemini 12 astronauts , James A. Lovell Jr . and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr . late last night , but they were not expected to interfere with the scheduled completion of their mission shortly after noon today . Nevertheless , the astronauts appear to be in for a bumpy ride when they splash down in predicted 4-foot waves . Fuel Cell Problem The problem was in a heater in the spacecraft 's fuel cell system . The astronauts were awakened when readings on the ground showed that an automatic heater was tending to push the pressure in the system 's hydrogen tank too high . It was the third night in a- row that they were awakened prematurely . If the situation had continued , the excess pressure would have escaped from a vent on the side of the craft , causing it to roll slightly . It was solved by the astronauts opening a circuit breaker , thereby cutting off power to the heater . They were then allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3:30 a. m . Chicago time to start their final day 's schedule . Mission End Not Affected National Aeronautics and Space administration officials said cutting off the heater would not affect the completion of the mission since there is enough pressure in the hydrogen side of the fuel cell system to last thru the end of the mission . The fuel cell system produces electrical power for the space . craft thru the interaction of hydrogen and oxygen . As a byproduct , the system produces water for the astronauts . Weather exnerts for NASA said waves of 4 feet with swells of from 5 to 7 feet are expected in the western Atlantic recovery area 707 miles southeast of Cape Kennedy . Wo n't Bar Recovery Visibility is expected to be 9 miles , with winds from the north at about 15 m. p. h. and scattered to broken cloud coverage at 2,000 feet . Despite the seas ' being higher than in most earlier recoveries , today 's weather is not expected to interfere with the recovery . The astronauts will be over the Pacific on the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer on board the spacecraft will fire its retro rockets at 12:46 p. m . Chicago time . Approximately 30 minutes later they will splash down in the recovery area where helicopters from the aircraft carrier Wasp will be waiting to pick them up . The astronauts spent a fairly quiet afternoon yesterday , performing experiments and taking photographs of the earth . This came after the loss yesterday morning of a third thruster on their spacecraft . The astronauts went to sleep at 7 p. m. in preparation for their last day in space . Earlier the astronauts set the second record of their flight , chalking up a total of 5 hours and 36 minutes with a hatch open in space on a single flight . The previous record , set on last September 's Gemini 11 flight , was 2 hours and 47 minutes . Aldrin Sets Record The first record was set Monday when Aldrin successfully took a 2 hour and 9 minute working walk in space , beating the old record by one minute . The record for open batch time is based on Aldrin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spent standing in his open cockpit Saturday , and another 59 minutes spent stand ing up in his cockpit yesterday morning .
