 | Why Europeans Criticize the U.S.A. I ARRIVED in Princeton , N.J. , some years ago to take up a teaching position . My wife was with me , and we were housed in the quarters of a professor who was on sabbatical leave . On the day of our arrival , neighbors visited my wife and asked her if she could cook . " Very little , " she admitted . " But I hope I 'll find a cook . " " You wo n't , " they told her . " But we 'll take turns , cook your first meals and teach you . " Which they did , with patience and consideration that we Have never forgotten . This , to me , typifies the United States ? a friendly , generous country with real equality among its people . Unfortunately , many of my fellow Europeans feel quite differently , and frequently go out of their way to be critical of Americans . It is slight solace to realize that much of this criticism comes from persons who know little about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , read in American books , or heard from American tourists . For it is precisely these people who compose the great majority of Europeans . It is vital , therefore , for those on both sides of the Atlantic to understand the nature of such criticism so that we can erase whatever basis exists for it . Only then can we get on 79  |p8o  with the main business of our common good . The reproach that one most often hears is that the United States seems to have a superiority complex with respect to Europe . Americans always seem to be thinking , " We have the only real civilization . We 'll try to teach you ! " This was President Wilson 's attitude in 1919 . He exasperated his European partners because he spoke to them like a prophet . To him the Fourteen Points were a veritable Mosaic Law . " Fourteen ! " Clemenceau once snorted . " God himself had only ten ! " The same situation has occurred frequently since the end of World War II . The Americans have imposed their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Vietnam , at Suez and in North Africa . The consequences have sometimes been disastrous . An Italian secretary who has often worked for American organizations once said to me , " The trouble is that Americans think that whatever has been successful in their own country will necessarily be good for Europe , Asia or Africa . This is just not so . Whether it be in NATO or the United Nations , they refuse to treat with Europeans on a basis of equality . They think of Europe as a useful place to establish military bases , but they never deal with Europeans as allies whose opinions should be considered . " This is true not only in politics , Europeans contend , but also in the whole range of day-to-day living habits . Americans condemn in Europe everything which is different from their own customs . They are suspicious of its hygiene and of its food . They constantly ask such questions as : " Is the water drinkable in Dijon ? " " Is it safe to use French toilets ? " " Is n't your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained to me , " Your Paris traffic regulations just do n't make sense . Why do n't you make all the streets one-way , with alternate east and west traffic , the way we do in New York ? That would solve all your problems . " Of course it would , in theory . But he had forgotten that it took 17 centuries to build Paris , and it can hardly be converted into an American gridiron overnight , even if we so desired . The result of all this is that the European , tired of receiving advice and listening to sermons , begins to look for things in American life that he can criticize . " They have an easy life , all right , " he tells himself , " but there must be troubles underneath it all . And their wives do n't know how to cook a really tasty meal ? it must be terrible to have to eat out of cans all year long . " And so the superiority complex that Europeans feel in Americans leads to counterattacks out of pure self-defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ignorant of the United States than Americans are of Europe . The Frenchman who would be offended if an American asked him whether France was 1963 WHY EUROPEANS CRITICIZE THE U.S.A. 81  | larger than Belgium does not himself know where Los Angeles is . We also tend to forget the many American travelers who go out of their way to understand customs different from their own , who make their visits to Europe veritable artistic or literary pilgrimages . THE SECOND criticism that a majority of Europeans make ? unjustly , in my opinion ? concerns your policy of foreign aid . " Yes , " they say , " Americans have spent a lot of money abroad . But why ? Only to establish their own economic imperialism throughout the world , to set up markets where they can sell their excess production , to get control of foreign raw materials and industries . " The truth is that the Marshall Plan was generous , efficacious and disinterested . Marshall said , in all sincerity , " Our policy is directed , not against any country or doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Marshall Plan in fact put Europe back on its feet . The American people are not imperialist . Obviously U.S. financiers hope that their investments will be profitable . And obviously the U.S. government hopes that its foreign aid will stop the spread of communism . But the American people could not care less about acquiring new territory or extending their influence over other peoples . They are sincerely hostile to all aggression , to all imperialism . THE THIRD major criticism is that Americans are materialists . " The only things that interest them are their gadgets . They have no spiritual life , no culture , no traditions . Their God is the almighty dollar . When you visit their country , the guides always tell you how big a thing is , how much it cost . And when Americans visit a country like Greece , they stop in front of the Acropolis and ask , How much did this cost to build ? ' They adore statistics , and put blind faith in them . Their over-accelerated pace of life leaves no time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so , in spite of their wealth , they are unhappy . " European intellectuals who have never been in America contend that " the proof of this materialism is that the social position of the intellectual is much lower in the United States than in Europe . Their education ca n't compare with ours . And all their artists have been imported from Europe . " . The answer to this one is easy . First , the passion for machines is now as widespread in Europe as in the United States . The average European also wants his own car , refrigerator , television . Second , the way of life of people who own gadgets is not necessarily any more materialist than that of anyone else . On the contrary : machines liberate men from the debasing aspects of their work ; they are symbols of emancipation and equality . Americans , far from being materialists , are incorri- gible idealists , the Don Quixotes of our time . As far as American education is concerned , there is a great deal to be said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The schools , at all levels , are open to all . Thirtythree percent of American youngsters go to college . Secondary education may be of higher caliber in France , but only a limited percentage of French children complete their secondary education , and American youngsters quickly catch up with Europeans at the university level . Thirty million American adults go to evening classes . Graduate schools , research laboratories and scientific institutions like M.I.T. or Cal Tech are at least the equal of their European counterparts . The best proof of this is that in 1960 there were 58,000 foreign students in the United States , 7000 of them Europeans ; 8000 foreign doctors were completing their studies in America , 1400 of them Europeans . No greater compliment could be paid . As for culture , the United States no longer borrows from Europe . In the 19th century , of course , American culture was largely that of the Old World , since most Americans had come from Europe . Today , however , many American-grown writers ? such as Ernest Hemingway , William Faulkner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are profoundly admired by young European writers . Moreover , our theaters are putting on plays by Arthur Miller , Tennessee Williams , Thornton Wilder , William Saroyan . And Walt Disney 's movies have become , to us , classics . American writers have won six Nobel Prizes . George Gershwin , Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein are world-famous musicians . Jerome Robbins is one of the world 's great masters of choreography . In architecture , Rockefeller Center , the new office buildings along New York City 's Park Avenue , the residential districts of Kansas City are models for the world . And this culture is not limited to an elite . It is much more widespread than in Europe . Eight thousand American libraries lend 11,500,000 books each week . Paperback books are found not only in bookstores but in drugstores , airports and railway stations , giving everyone access to the great works of past and present at very small cost . Music is no less appreciated . Europeans have trouble believing that U.S. citizens sponsor 1200 symphony orchestras , and that 30 million concert tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music 24 hours a day . Thirst for learning , cultivate one 's self , are the United States . THE LAST criticism I will mention , and perhaps the one which most damages the reputation of the United States abroad , concerns race relations . I once heard a Frenchman a desire to universal in  | say , " I ca n't understand the riots they have in their schools just because a little Negro child has been enrolled . For a nation which claims to be advanced and wants to give lessons to the rest of the world , this is unpardonable . " A famous European writer has said , " The Negro question is a cancer that will kill America . " I can not agree . Of course the question is very serious , and it must be resolved in terms of justice and equality . But I am certain that it will be resolved . There still remain , in some states , intransigent white extremists ; but as far as the country as a whole is concerned , the question has already been settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the issue . Their decrees are not always obeyed , but compliance is becoming more and more universal . The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People informed me that , although much remains to be done , progress has been great , and that the problem will be resolved without violence initiated by the advocates of civil rights . As 1963 opens , the standard of living of American Negroes is inferior to that of white Americans , but it is still higher than that of most other peoples in the world . In no other nation has an ethnic minority made such remarkable progress in so short a time . It will take many years to integrate the Negroes completely into American society ; but constructive steps are being taken , and in 30 to 50 years integration will be total . EUROPEANS must not judge the United States hastily . It is an immense country with great diversity . Mississippi is as different from Minnesota as Spain is from Sweden . There is not one image of America but many . Every time I hear someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know that the opposite statement could be made and that both might be true . Nor should we expect Americans to resemble Europeans from every point of view . Nations are what they are because of their history , their geography , their customs . Differences have to be accepted . But great resemblances must also be recognized . Almost unconsciously , America and Europe are drawing together . Rapidity of transportation , new media of information , imminent worldwide television are bringing nations closer to one another . The true image is obliterating the fictional one . We may not always agree with our American friends on methods to be employed , but we are in accord with them on ends to be pursued . All of us , Europeans and Americans , have a job to do together to maintain the defense of the Western world and to build a sound future . If we remain united , we will preserve peace and liberty . If we allow ourselves to become divided , it will mean the end of civilization . The choice is easy to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
