As one of the world 's great treasure houses of art , the Vatican has long acted as if all painters of merit stopped painting and all sculptors stopped sculpting some time during the 17th century . Last week , almost by stealth , the Vatican opened two galleries devoted solely to late 19th and 20th century art . There was no ceremony , not even an announcement to the press . <P> Included were the work of 19 Italians and five Frenchmen , all on their very best behavior . Rodin is represented by a terra cotta study of his Thinker , Rouault by a somber Autumn . About the liveliest item in the show is a couple of playful cats done by Sculptor Pericle Fazzini . As usual , Giorgio de Chirico was unhappy about the choice of his work-an uninspired Still Life with Fruit and Milan Cathedral Seen from Rooftops . Said he : " Of course all my works are good , but these are of lesser importance . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
