txt The former head of United Nations operations in Katanga Province in the Congo charged today that he had resigned because of a campaign of pressure against him by Britain and France . Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien of Ireland said in a bitter statement that Britain had been " particularly active , in this respect , and not unduly fastidious about the methods it employed . " He maintained that the longrange objective of the campaign was to intimidate members of the United Nations Secretariat from carrying out measures opposed by Britain and France . The effect of such a campaign , he warned , could be fully as disruptive to United Nations operations as the more openly hostile tactics of the Soviet Union . Dr. O'Brien announced that he had resigned from Ireland 's Foreign Service , of which he was formerly the second-rank // ing career official . He had done this , he said , " in order to recover my freedom of speech and action . " Dr. O'Brien was sent to Katanga in June to Implement a resolution of the Security Council last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers from the Katanga Army . When he arrived , Dr. O'Brien said , he found that there were more than 500 foreign soldiers still ! serving in Katanga , including 200 officers of the Belgian army . His instructions from the late Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold , he said , were to " end a situation in which a Security Council resolution was being openly flouted . " Call for Removal Cited ? When he began pressing for removal of the mercenaries , : Dr. O'Brien continued , he found ! himself exposed to " mounting : criticism " by Belgium , Britain ' and France . After he succeeded : in bringing about the evacuation of a large group of mercenaries at the end of August , he added , the British and French began to press for his removal . This pressure became " active and heavy , " Dr. O'Brien charged , after the United Nations forces moved against Katanga in September . He noted that a " hate campaign " launched by President Moise Tshombe of Katanga had received " more or less open support " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had requested the Irish Foreign Minister , Frank Aiken , to ask the Acting Secretary General of the United Nations , U Thant , to relieve him from his post . He strongly implied , however , that British-French pressure had made his request highly welcome to Secretariat officials . " The immediate end pursued and eventually obtained , " Dr. O'Brien said , " was to make my continued presence in the organization a burden both to the Secretariat and to myself . " In discussing his statement , the former official stressed that his criticism was not directed in any way towards Mr. Thant or other members of ? the Secretariat . There was no comment on Dr. O'Brien 's charges by Secretariat officials other than a statement saying the accusations undoubtedly would be studied " with great interest . " Privately , one official said that " many of us would agree " with Dr. O'Brien 's account of British and French ressure . Dr. O'Brien was particularly critical of what he said was British and French undermining of the execution of the Security Council resolution on Katanga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. O'Brien noted that the Soviet Union was accused of obstructing the work of the United Nations by the excessive use of the veto , " A danger not less great , and must less known , " he said , " is failure by a permanent member to vote against  --  and thereby veto  --  resolutions to which it is in fact radically opposed , In this way the organization becomes committed to tasks the fulfillment of which is obstructed by very powerful members of the organization . " " Servants of the organization trying to carry out these tasks on behalf of the Security Council are squeezed out by members of the Council itself , " he continued . Dr. O'Brien charged that the British-French campaign against him had the ultimate purpose of warning Secretariat officials " that whatever resolutions of the Security Council may say , it is unwise to apply them if these powers do not wish them to be applied . " Dr. O'Brien did not mention the United States in the statement , which he had written out in longhand on six sheets of stationery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States had " firmly supported " the resolutions of the Security Council . He asserted that other Secretariat officials had been the victims of similar opposition . Although he did not give any names , one of those he was underst000d to have in mind was Rajeshwar Dayal of India , vio resigned earlier this year as head of the United Nations operation in the Congo after heavy criticism by some Western diplomats of his alleged " softness " toward the followers of the late Patrice Lumumba . The Irish diplomat said that while others who had undergone such treatment ' had remained silent because they judged it " in the best interest of the United Nations , " he could not agree . " If my resignation and consequent publicity make it even a little harder for these members of the Council to obstruct the implementation of the Council 's new resolution also  --  thereby wrecking the United Nations operation in the Congo , then my resignation will have been well ! worthwhile . " The new resolution , approved Nov. 24 , called for a renewed : effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations headquarters in the middle of November by the Acting Secretary General for what was then described as " consultations . " Ever since September , however , there have been reports here that he was about to be replaced . No announcement has been made , after his release yesterday , as to who will replace him . Dr. O'Brien said he was not sure what he would do next . He has no immediate plans to return to Ireland . He said that he had given some thought to writing a book in which he might give a more detailed account of the difficulties he had experienced . The 44-year-old Irishman , a graduate of Trinity College in Dublin , had been in the Foreign Service of his country since 1942 . He had served on the Irish delegations to five General Assembly sessions , where he became acquainted with Mr. Hammarskjold . When the late Secretary Gen- : eral asked him last June to undertake the Katanga mission , ' Dr. O'Brien was Assistant Sec-. retary of the Irish Department ! of External Affairs .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
