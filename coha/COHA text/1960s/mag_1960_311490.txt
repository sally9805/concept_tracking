To 1,683,000 U.S. Army and Air Force men and their families stationed in 27 countries , payday usually means a visit to the PX , the world 's biggest exclusive shopping preserve . Last week the payday rush was on in 5,933 PXs , helping to make the Army and Air Force Exchange Service rank in dollar volume below only Sears , Roebuck , J. C. Penney , Montgomery Ward and F. W. Woolworth among retail chains . To maintain its place as one of the U.S. military 's greatest fringe benefits , PX branches stock up to 30,000 items , sell everything from underwear to refrigerators-all at cut-rate prices designed for the private who earns only $78 a month , the master sergeant who earns $310 . Yet the PX earns money , last year made a $60 million profit on sales of $895 million-and is doing even better in 1960. * <P> To become so big , the PX has changed greatly since its founding 65 years ago to sell horse blankets and snuff . From the raggle-taggle mobile units and Quonset huts that most G.I.s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PX system has moved into fancier quarters , now includes shopping centers the size of a city block . They are designed to meet the needs of the new-style serviceman and his family . Eighty-seven percent of all officers and some 50% of all enlisted men are married , with an average of two children . Says the wife of a sergeant stationed in Frankfurt . West Germany : " If they ever took the PX away from us , I 'd be on the next boat home . " <P> Dine-A-Mite &; Poker Chips . The man responsible for keeping soldiers and their families well supplied is Brigadier General Ray Joseph Laux , 52 , a grey-haired , blue-eyed Quartermaster Corps planning expert . From his office at worldwide exchange headquarters in Manhattan , General Laux commands a retailing complex that could demand the services of a $200,000-a-year executive in the world of business ; he does the job for $16,725 a year . Of the PX 's 67,500 employees , some 44,000 are foreign nationals working abroad . This mix sometimes presents problems . In Morocco , faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to set up a system of poker chips to place orders : red for a hamburger , blue for coffee , etc . <P> To please its customers , the European Exchange System ( 2,918 branches ) , biggest of 14 PX districts , has built seven PX drive-in snack bars along West German Autobahnen with such names as Java Junction and Dine-A-Mite . Over the past ten years the European System has nearly doubled its stock of items , which now includes Italian fashions , men 's custom-tailored suits , frozen pheasants and ten different brands of can openers . The PX system also includes barbershops , delicatessens , auto parts shops , dry cleaning and laundry service , and shoe , watch and radio repair shops . <P> But what pleases the soldier most about the PX is its prices , which run about 20% below U.S. retail prices . Reason : the PX does not have to pay income taxes , gets free shipment of goods overseas , has its stores built for it , spends little for advertising or promotion . Clothing sells for 15% to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less , quality cameras for up to 45% less . And by buying from the PX , the soldier is actually dealing himself a bonus : all PX profits go to military welfare funds .
