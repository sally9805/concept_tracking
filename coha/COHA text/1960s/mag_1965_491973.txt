Inside dressing room " A " at New York 's Majestic Theater , he sits and waits for the curtain . He has dabbed makeup powder on his cheeks , smoothed his hair with grease and placed a narrow strip of bandage over his right eye . He has donned khaki pants , white sneakers and a bright orange jersey which conceals the microphone taped to his chest . Now he turns to face a mirror framed by 30 lights  --  a scrawny , one-eyed , broken-nosed Negro with a jutting jaw . " Five minutes , " echoes the call from the stage director 's desk . " Five minutes , please . " He has been in the dressing room for more than an hour . He left his brownstone town house on East 93rd Street just before seven o'clock and drove downtown in his gray Rolls-Royce with his chauffeur riding in the back . At the theater a waiter brought steaming pots of soul-food to the dressing room  --  pigs ' knuckles and neckbones and tails and feet and rice and black-eyed peas . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Baby . " he grinned . " I just eat this stuff on the nights that I 'm colored . Wait till you see what PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRANK DANDRIDGE SAMMY DAVIS I eat on the nights that I 'm Jewish . " He finished his dinner and slumped down on a couch . The television set blared noisily . A babble of voices mounted in the hallway outside , but he slept until 815 . Then his valet , a balding . sad-eyed , quietly efficient man named Murphy Bennett . nudged him and said it was time to dress . Three years ago , when Richard Burton played in Camelot at the Majestic , this dressing room belonged to him and he called it his pub . Now the decor is different . Pasted on the walls are the 218 cables and telegrams that flowed in on opening night  --  from Bobby Kennedy , Peter Lawford , Nathan Leopold , Jack Benny and California Gov . Edmund G. ( Pats Brown . Interspersed among them are photographs of Queen Elizabeth , John F. Kennedy , Audrey Hepburn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , " the caption reads , " but you ca n't kill an idea . " .. to your places . " The stage manager 's call nips at his reverie . Out front the curtain is rising . and through a dressing-room speaker he can hear the staccato gymnasium sounds that take the place of an overture . Now the sounds become a rhythm , an acoustical tattoo , as fighters spar , skip rope and pummel leather punching bags . A young production aide is standing at the doorway . " Are you ready ? " he asks . " Baby , " says Sammy Davis , bounding out of the dressing room , " I was born ready . " In the original version of Clifford Odets 's play , Golden Boy , the protagonist was an Italian youth torn between a promising career as a violinist and the more immediate rewards of the prize ring . As a straight dramatic role , the part  --  played first by Luther Adler on Broadway in 1937 , then by William Holden in the movie version two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revival  --  was demanding enough . But now , in the context of a musical , the part is tougher than ever . As Joe Wellington , a bitter , ambitious youth struggling to escape his Harlem ghetto and linclsuccessthrough violence in the distant , diamond-studded world downtown , Sammy Davis is taxed as never before . He must remain on stage for 105 of the production 's 125 minutes ; he must dance four numbers and sing 10 songs . He must also act . He must make the audience understand  --  if not sympathize with  --  the frustrations of a basically unsympathetic character . And he must establish the integrity of his love for a white woman to such a degree that the audience is not repulsed by their affair . Golden Boy is a potpourri of brilliance and imperfection . But there are few imperfections in Davis 's performance . He dominates that stage , and now the smart money people are saying the show will have a long , successful run . Sammy Davis had yearned to win acclaim as a legitimate actor . He staked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated $800 , - 000 in earnings to accept the part , and he poured all his energies and talents into five grueling months of tryouts and rehearsals . " It 's been a long , uphill climb , " he says . " Do n't let anyone ever tell you different . " On the surface , the most surprising thing is that he even bothered to make that climb . For at 38 this versatile performer  --  Milton Berle once called him " the greatest entertainer in the world " ? had seemingly conquered every conceivable challenge in his field . As a dancer , mimic and comedian he had drawn standing-room-only crowds consistently throughout the world . He had been the only American entertainer ever invited to play two consecutive command performances by the Queen of England . As a singer he had made 32 albums ; in 1963 alone his records sold more than one millioncopies . As a television star he was the first Negro to break the color barrier in a dramatic show . As a movie actor he had appeared in 10 films . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the star of a 1956 musical called Air . Wonderful , which ran for more than a year . Since 1957 Davis had received  --  and rejected  --  more than a dozen offers to return to Broadway . His close friend , Frank Sinatra , cautioned him against another stage appearance ; so did his managers . They pointed out he could earn $1.5 million a year simply by staying where he was . The weight of logic seemed to he on their side . Why , then , did he gamble on Golden Boy ? " After Mr. Wonderful , " he says , " I was pretty leery about the theater . I said the only thing I 'd come back for was something I believed in greatly . Well , baby , this is it . It shocks , not just to be shocking , but only to be honest . " Then , too , he had been living on the road nine months a year for more years than he could remember . A Broadway appearance would allow him to spend more time at home with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mark and Tracey . Yet probably the single most compelling factor behind his decision to accept the part was a compulsive desire to prove that he could excel as an actor . Few people accepted him as one , and the rejection stung . " Sammy does n't want people to think of him as The Nightclub Entertainer anymore , " explains his valet , Murphy Bennett . " He wants people to look at him and say , ' There goes Sammy Davis , The Actor . ' " The image Davis projects today is not quite so clear-cut . In public he sometimes appears overly aggressive , irritatingly sure of himself . Yet in private he often seems lonely , plagued by self-doubts and easily hurt . Hispersonality is , in fact , a study in contradictions . He reads voraciously , speaks articulately on subjects ranging from poetry to the trouble in Vietnam . He believes in flying saucers with a fierce intensity ( " I 've seen ' ern , baby " ) , and he fancies himself an amateur James Bond . ( " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arm . I learned to drink like Bond , and I even started taking cold showers . Only I could n't stand the cold water . " ) He has dropped the Jr . from his name and insists today on being treated with the respect due an entertainer who has Made it Big . He loves making money , and he spends it wildly on records ( 6,000 albums ) and clothes ( 600 pairs of shoes . 200 suits ) and gadgets ( " They ai n't gon na put out a gimmick in the world that I ai n't gon na have ; they 're too much fun " ) and cars ( a Rolls-Royce , a Corvette Sting Ray , a Lincoln Continental , a Buick station wagon , a Ford Mustang and a custom-made Cadillac with a built-in bar and two telephones ) . He also gives time and money unflinchingly to charity . Hillard Elkins is a man who knows something about the Davis drive . Elkins has been an actor and an actor 's manager . and now he is Golden Boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top very quickly . " Ten years ago , " Elkins begins , " Sammy 's goal was simply to make more money than any other Negro entertainer . He did that . Now his goal is to be the best in anything he does . He knew he 'd reached the zenith in nightclubs . Where could he go to grow ? Nowhere . So he accepted a challenge that most performers will not accept . " Adds Golden Boy director Arthur Penn : " The man is almost presumptuous . He has a vision of excellence that by virtue of his education and background he simply has no right to have . But he has it nonetheless . " Davis 's education and background did leave something to be desired . Born at 140th Street and 8th Avenue in Harlem , he spent his first birthday in a crib backstage at the old Hippodrome . His father , mother and adopted uncle . Will Mastin , were vaudeville troupers . At four he made his movie debut in a Warner Brothers comedy called Rufus Jones for President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his talent may have delighted audiences , it angered the authorities , who yanked him offstage for violating child-labor laws . Determined to keep the act together , Mastin stuck a fat cigar between his teeth and introduced him as a 45-year-old dancing midget . He never spent a day in school . In 1943 , at the age of 17 , he joined the Army . Eventually transferred into Special Services , Davis wrote , directed and produced camp shows and sharpened his talents as a singer , dancer and mimic . Upon his discharge he rejoined his father and uncle in the Will Mastin Trio and began to play a succession of one-night gigs in third-rate theaters . In 1951 Jack Benny helped them get a booking at Ciro 's in Hollywood . The manager offered $500 a week ; they wanted $550 . Finally their agent promised to pay the first week 's difference from his own pocket . They signed the contract and , within two weeks , shared top billing . Their income tripled . " After the war , " Davis once told an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could n't work certain hotels because of the Negro bit . Certain headliners refused to go on with us because we stole the show . I was so hungry . I was trying to do everything . I could do 50 impersonations . Play the drums . Play the trumpet . Play the bass fiddle . Play the piano . Dance . Sing . Tell jokes . Well , then we made it . After that night in Ciro 's , every day for the next three years I had a new chick , Wine , women and song . les the old story of the guy who does n't have it and then he gets it . He fluffs friends . He does a hundred things wrong . He knows he 's doing wrong , see , but he ca n't stop . " I bought 12 suits at a time , $175 a whack . I bought tailor-made shirts , cars  --  fast ones . I bought gold cigarette cases for everybody . All my life I wanted to buy something in a store and not ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1954 I must have blown S150,000 . " Such extravagance failed to harm Davis 's growing popularity . He made guest appearances on The Sieve Allen Show and the Colgate Comedy Hour . He made a pilot television film for ABC called Three 's Company , which remained on the shelf for lack of a sponsor . And  --  with the trio  --  he played the nightclub circuit : New York , Chicago . Hollywood . Miami , Las Vegas . Davis worked relentlessly on developing other talents . He became enamored of photography and submitted a batch of pictures to a national magazine . He used the name David Samuels . Only after the pictures were accepted did he reveal who David Samuels was . " I had to find out if I was any good , " he says . " Then he decided to learn how to play the vibes , " comedian Karl Barrie remembers . " He did n't just take it on one level . He mastered it . So many performers will take a thing halfway and stop when they get applause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately unhappy . His hopes were accelerating faster than his ability to realize them . He felt SAMMY DAVIS imprisoned by the color of his skin . He sensed . correctly , that no amount of financial success would ever enable him to overcome that . " I was tempted , man , to go abroad . to get outta here . " Then he rejected that idea . " It was swinging all right in London and Paris , " he says . " hut none of the Negro artists there were actually creating anything . I suddenly realized that I never saw a single happy expatriate . " Davis has always had a unique , almost masochistic talent for adding handicaps to the ones he acquired at birth . In November , 1954 , he suffered one that almost ended his career  --  an auto accident that resulted in the loss of his left eye . " I spent three . four days in total darkness , " he recalls . " I began thinking about my faults . That 's when I began to change . " Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was trying to find a religion that would say something to me and talk about Inv needs , " he says . " I met a rabbi at a benefit in Las Vegas and got interested in Judaism . It gave me something I 'd been missing  --  peace of mind . So I converted . For a long time I was reluctant to go into a synagogue . / was afraid people would think I was trying to pull something . I may joke about it , but it 's not something I take lightly . " The loss of an eye and his religious conversion seemed only to enhance his stage appeal . His income soared . Soon he found new ways to spend it . He bought an interest in a Hollywood nightclub called the Moulin Rouge . He became a partner in a restaurant operation . He gambled heavily and aroused the interest of the Internal Revenue Service . which claimed that he and his father owed the Government $56,000 . " I 'm not one of the great businessmen of all times , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no setup for it . NI y businessmanager . Jim Waters , and my lawyers started to take over a few years ago , and I 'm afraid they succeeded in straightening me out . " In 1960 Davis added a third significant handicap  --  one that few of his friends thought he could ever overcome . For years his romantic affiliations had spiced the gossip columns . He dated Kim Novak ( Their relationship reportedly came to a crashing halt only when Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn asked Davis , " You 're blind in one eye . Would you like to try for two ? " ) . He married Negro dancer Loray White ( They separated three months later and eventually were divorced ) . He became engaged briefly in 1959 to a blond Canadian named Joan Stuart . Then he met Swedish actress May Britt . " 1 invited her to a barbecue , " Davis recalls , " and she brought a date . And she did n't sit at my table  --  she sat at another table . And she did n't sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I figured I 'd light it to the bitter end . " On November 13 , 1960 , in the living room of Davis 's Hollywood home , Rabbi William M. Kramer pronounced the couple man and wife . " We used to get 15 to 25 hate letters every day , " Davis recalls . " You just do n't believe people can be that low . " Until last year the couple retained bodyguards for their protection . " Sammy explained the way it could be , before we married , " May says , " and everything happened just the way he said it would . But I loved the man then , and I still love him . Besides , people are getting used to us now . You get to the point where you almost relax and then , wham , it hits you . But so far the kids have not been affected . At three and four , they lead a pretty sheltered life . And Sammy is a marvelous husband . Much more than I expected . I would have settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . Davis is asked endless questions about interracial marriages . They bore him and sometimes make him angry . " All I can say is that my marriage works . " he snaps . Curiously , Davis had won acceptance as an entertainer prior to 1960 in almost every corner of the globe  --  except in Harlem . There he was criticized unjustly for being " anti-Negro . " " Sammy 's career just threw him into another element , " explains George Rhodes , his musical conductor . " But those cats uptown  --  they figured he was trying to be something he was n't , that he did n't want to be around his own people . They did n't realize you have to be downtown to get your head above the water . " The situation changed when Davis began getting involved in the struggle for equal rights . " Seven years ago , " he says , " I could n't have cared less . But now I care . In the past few years I 've read about Negro history until the good eye gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . The reason I want to fight now is my two kids . I want to be able to look at them and say , ' It 's going to be better . ' " As he became increasingly committed to " the cause , " Davis sought entertainment vehicles which could further it . The opportunity materialized in an unexpected quarter . " It was around October , 1961 , " recalls producer Hillard Elkins . " I was in London , and I heard Sammy was appearing at the Prince of Wales Theater . So I caught the midnight show . He started doing this number . He was wearing blue jeans and an old T-shirt . and all of a sudden 1 said to myself , ' That 's Golden Boy . ' " We got together the next day and I said , ' Sammy , I 've got the greatest idea of the century . You 've got ta do Golden Boy . It 's the story of a young Negro breaking out of the ghetto , and  --  well , it 's your show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he 'd think it over . And then around Christmas he called and said , ' Swing , baby . " Elkins swung . He purchased the rights to Golden Boy and persuaded Odets to try to rewrite his drama as a musical . In March , 1963 , he signed Davis to a contract  --  and established a Broadway precedent . He agreed to pay Davis 10 percent of the weekly box-office gross , 15 percent of the production 's profits and a fat expense account . The total is approximately $10,000 per week  --  the highest figure ever earned by a star on Broadway . Rehearsals began at New York 's Ethel Barrymore Theater last May 18 . " We 're going to Philadelphia to break in the show , Boston to have some fun and Detroit for the race riots , " Elkins joked . But from the beginning , almost nothing happened according to plan , Odets had submitted two drafts before his death in August , 1963 . Both missed their mark . A series of " play doctors " then tackled the problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story above the level of mediocrity . Golden Boy opened at Philadelphia 's Shubert Theater on June 26 . Reviews were mixed . Critics were kind to Davis , but found the script unconvincing . Five weeks later the show moved on to Boston . The book had been revised and tightened . " But I felt we were still in a lot of trouble , " Elkins recalls . Critics agreed : Golden Boy was deep in crisis . Less than eight weeks remained before its scheduled Broadway opening . Director Peter Coe had been fired . Producer Elkins had exhausted his supply of rewrite men . Davis was disconsolate . Everything he had wanted so badly to achieve seemed to be eluding his grasp . " Sammy 's biggest difficulty , " says playwright William Gibson , who had been called in to rescue the script , " was the lack of material . He was trying to establish the whole entertainment value of the show in the songs . He knew there was nothing else except the songs . And he was overacting . " On August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Critics panned it once again . For nearly two weeks , ever since Gibson had finished rewriting the script , the cast had played one show at night and rehearsed a totally different show during the day . Davis poured himself into the effort , dredging up emotions and experiences from his own past to help Gibson understand the meaning of Negro frustration . Now he was physically and emotionally exhausted . One final effort remained . " We called it ' Operation Transfer , " producer Elkins says . " We closed the old show on a Saturday night , rehearsed around the clock and opened up a brand-new show on Monday night . " Adds Davis , " It was the hardest thing I 've ever gone through in my life . " Audience response to the new effort was hearteningly encouraging . " For the first time in months we felt that we were on the right track , " Elkins remembers . Yet much remained to be done . In mid-September the show moved on to New York . Elkins postponed its opening date three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day off . He did n't get it . The show was still in serious trouble , and everyone knew it . Music and lyrics still sounded strangely out of place . Whole scenes seemed disjointed . Characters lacked motivation . In Philadelphia and Boston . Davis played the part of a Negro musician who turned to the prize ring . In Detroit he dropped the musician 's identity and became a premed student . The character still strained credulity . Then Gibson had an idea . Why not make him simply a bitter young Negro , a boy whose tremendous ambitions lead eventually to his self-destruction ? Revisions continued . On Friday  --  four days before the opening curtain  --  Davis learned that other changes would be added over the weekend . " That Friday night was the only time he was ever obstreperous about acting , " Penn recalls . " He could n't absorb what I was saying . He had worked himself to the end of his resources , and he could n't do more . " The next day Davis disappeared . Five minutes before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elkins and said she did n't know where her husband was . Elkins canceled the matinee . He put on the show that night with able understudy Lamont Washington in the title role . Seventy percent of the audience walked out in disappointment . Desperately Elkins tried to locate his star . At four o'clock on Sunday morning Davis called the producer . " Welcome home . Penrod . " Elkins said . trying to appear blas ? . " If you want to open Tuesday , we 'd better rehearse today . " " I 'll be there , " Davis said . He was . " I never ran away from anything before in my life , " Davis says . " But if I had n't run on Saturday , there would have been nothing , absolutely nothing . That Saturday did n't come out of fear , or thinking , ' Oh , God , what are the critics going to say ? ' I 'd been promised a day off and I never got it . I know my voice . Three doctors all said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to sing on opening night . ' " The weather on opening night was dismal . A bone-chilling drizzle fell on the city , adding to the mood of general pessimism . The curtain rose early , just after seven o'clock , and it was obvious almost immediately that something was wrong . Davis 's voice was harsh and gravelly ; he was spitting out his lines instead of letting them flow from inner conviction . His first song was disappointing . An uneasy feeling swept over the audience . Suddenly , toward the middle of Act I , he recovered . The songs flowed smoother and he was understatingemotions  --  doing at last what Penn and Gibson had told him so many times to do . He maneuvered through the difficult kissing scene with Paula Wayne without a mishap . He handled the tricky father-son confrontation in the second act with feeling and skill . Then the show was over . Waves of applause brought him back on stage three times . Yet as he walked to the dressing room , he still seemed mired in a quicksand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . He waited until the crowds had left his dressing room , slipped on a tuxedo and went , finally , to the opening-night party at a restaurant across town to await the reviews . Tension rose . Finally someone yelled that Walter Kerr 's review ( in the Herald Tribune ) was in . " He hates it , huh ? " Davis asked . But Kerr did n't hate anything . " Mr. Davis , " he wrote , " is not so much at the top of his form as he is on top of a brand-new situation , licking it hands down .... The performance is there and it is serious , expert , affecting . " Someone else said Howard Taubman of The Times was giving the show a rave . The atmosphere of tension dissolved into wild frivolity . " did n't think we were gon na get the Times and the Trib . " Davis beamed . " It 's a hit . A great big hit . I feel ten feet tall . " Every night for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , clad in a blue terry-cloth robe , Davis lounged on the floor , sipping from a golden mug containing bourbon and Coke . " You wo n't believe this , " he remarked , " but right now do you know that Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis are at Vegas at the Sands ? Gambling ? Drinking ? They 're not legit , though . " Someone in the room said , " Well , Sam . looks like you 're pretty busy . " " Man , " Davis replied . " They got me workin ' like they think I 'm colored or sumpin ' . Damn . " He stayed in the dressing room for half an hour , and the knot of admirers slowly disentangled . He changed into a brown-checked suit , grabbed his coat , sprang down the steps and burst into a cluster of fans waiting by the stage-door entrance . " Do n't you ever get tired of signing autographs ? " someone asked . " No , baby , " Davis replied , scrawling his name with a spiderweb flourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't gon na give up now . " He finished and started walking down the corridor to the street . his black cane tapping a cadence on the asphalt . Chauffeur Herb Seeger was waiting with the Rolls-Royce . " Hey , " someone shouted . " There goes Sammy Davis . " Davis whirled and waved . " How ya doin ' , my man ? " he asked . Then he stepped into the car and was gone . ?
