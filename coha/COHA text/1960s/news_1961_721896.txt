txt WASHINGTON , June 22 ? Soviet diplomacy , like Soviet ballet and opera , is technically perfect , but unoriginal and predictable . It moves from one extreme to the other , from Swan Lake to Boris Godunov , very quickly . Thus , just a few days ago , we saw Sweet Nikita in Vienna , cooing peace , and now we have Naughty Nik in full-dress uniform , spouting fire . He is fishing for compromises . If he roars in the center of the stage , no doubt he thinks he can startle the timid , split the alliance , and arrange a deal . But he is not likely to hand the East Germans the power to start a world war , even if he " recognizes " them , for Prussian communism is even worse than Russian communism , and nobody knows it better than Khrushchev . Despite all the talk of military " solutions " of the Berlin dilemma , and of armored trains roaring through Helmstadt ( presumably with Alec Guinness as engineer ) , the Russians are really engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What the Russians Want They want to stabilize their empire from the Elbe River eastward . They want to sterilize Berlin . The want to halt the flow of refugees from East Germany through Berlin to the West ( for the sight of people fleeing the Communist Nirvana does not look good ) . And they want to eliminate Berlin as a source of Westem propaganda and a symbol of capitalistic prosperity . Obviously , this can not be done by war , any more than the West can assure the freedom of West Berlin by war , so the talk of war , while it makes big headlines , makes very little sense . The problem is to devise a counter-strategy that will meet not Khrushchev 's phony heroics but the substance of his plan . This will not be easy , because Berlin is surrounded by Communist territory , but it is not impossible either . For if Khrushchev 's objective is to create stability in Eastern Europe , it is certainly possible to make clear to him in advance that he can not force stability there against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits it , but it has in the last few years acquiesced in a Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe . It has not only increased its trade with the Eastern European Communists but actually given substantial aid to Poland and helped improve the condition of life in that country . If Khrushchev insists on defying the West 's legal rights in West Berlin and makes a peace treaty with East Germany on his own terms , there are all kinds of legalistic and economic counter-actions the West can take against the Communists . Two-Way Stretch This is not a one-way proposition . The West is not helpless in this game . The East Germans need access to the West to carry on their trade just as the West needs access to Berlin to meet its obligations there . The Russians need all kinds of communicatinns in the world , which are in our hands , just as our communications to Berlin are in their hands . So long as Khrushchev abides by the present status quo , disagreeable as it is all around , the West is willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Eastern Europe , and to limit the armaments of the West Germans , and even to increase trade with the Communist empire , but if he tries to enforce his own settlement , the West can at least deny him the stability he wants , This does not mean that the planning can not go on to deal with a military crisis in Germany . Of course it must go on because it is just possible , though unlikely , that Khrushchev is as bullheaded as he sounds , but it does mean that the planning must take into account the measures short of war that are available . A dangerous mood has been developing here that we can do nothing except get ready for a fight ; that Khrushchev is working on a military and not on a nonmilitary strategy . Chances are he is doing nothing of the kind . Having tried persuasion in Vienna and failed , he is now trying intimidation . The problem is to see that this fails too without getting in a panic about his angry threats .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
