AS the Viet Nam war grows bloodier , covering it becomes a more dangerous occupation for newsmen representing all media . Many correspondents are working under enemy fire-as ours were last week in the process of reporting for this issue 's stories on the war . Bureau Chief William Rademaekers was based in combustible Saigon , as were Correspondents Don Sider , Peter Vanderwicken and John Cantwell . After covering the bitter fighting in Hu , Karsten Prager flew out to Danang to send his report . <P> Also in Hu early in the week was Correspondent David Greenway . Moving with a Marine company at the Citadel , Greenway decided to go forward with a squad that was assigned to knock out a North Vietnamese army machine-gun post . As the squad reached a wall still standing amid the rubble , a Marine stood up to look through what had been a window , and an enemy soldier shot him through the neck . Greenway and a medical corpsman dragged the victim to the company command post , and once out of the line of fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> There , three other newsmen joined to help carry the man back to the rear . Just as the newsmen picked up the dying Marine , an enemy mortar round landed a few yards from them , blowing them into a ditch . Shrapnel hit Greenway in the left leg . He was taken out of Hu in a helicopter and treated at the U.S. military hospital at Phu Bai . <P> At week 's end , walking with a crutch , Greenway was back at work , but from his home in Hong Kong . <P> IT 'S not necessarily who won or lost a particular contest , but how and why they came to be winners or losers and what it all means to the players and to the game . That , in sum , is our philosophy of how we should cover sports . And so our Sport team , headed by Senior Editor George G. Daniels , pushes aside the routine and instead seeks out insights that will fit stories into the larger context of what sports have to do with life . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this week 's cover subject , Hockey Superstar Bobby Hull , observing the man at home , in his car , on the rink , at work on radio commercials , in his lawyer 's office , in a bar , signing autographs in a barbershop . Part of the reporting and most of the in-house research for Sport is done by Researcher Geraldine Kirshenbaum , who is often amused when sports people get nervous about having a feminine reporter around . Some hockey public relations men tried to keep her away from the players " because their language is so terrible and these men would be embarrassed to have a girl hear it . " She heard enough to confirm the point : the players ' language is terrible . Key man on our Sport team is Charles Parmiter , who has been writing the section since 1961 and whose application of talent to subject matches the intensity of Bobby Hull devoting himself to hockey . <P> Together , Daniels , Parmiter , Goodman and Kirshenbaum go at their tasks in the belief that what we must aim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
