txt  | measurement can be found . One thing that has never been observed to change as we go from our laboratory into a moving reference frame is the velocity of light as measured in the new frame . The clocks and rods that are speeding along the track in the moving system may or may not be different in some way from those left behind in the laboratory , but we can be sure that the velocity of light measured with the clocks and rods belonging to the new frame will measure the same as in the rest frame . As Fig. 4-7 shows , we have already admitted the possibility that the far ends of the rods may not pass in coincidence as we have arranged for 0 and 0 ' to do . We have drawn Fig. 4-7a on the assumption that a rod moving in the +x direction in the laboratory ( for some unknown reason ) becomes shorter . We shall show that this assumption will lead us into contradiction with the postulates and , therefore , that it can not be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and at A to aid us in finding out what would happen if the rods passed each other as shown . We arrange the equipment so that the lightpulse generator located at A ' will generate a short red flash just as it passes beneath the fixed rod . Similarly , we place a generator on A , so that the ( extension of the ) moving rod will cause it to emit a green flash at the instant of passing . These light pulses are exactly locatable in each reference system , whatever their measure of time or space may be , since each was an event of negligible duration occurring in a geometrical volume of negligible size . We look then , for the arrival of the two light flashes at 0 and 0 ' , where we have established clocks . It is conceivable that setting the clock at 0 ' into motion has in some way affected its time-measuring qualities , but this is not important for the moment , since our only concern is to record the relative time of arrival of the red and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash caused by the space-time coincidence of the points 0 ' and O. If the apparatus were not adjusted properly , so that 0 and 0 ' failed to pass in close spatial coincidence , then neither of the two clocks would start , and we should know that the experiment was unsuccessful . We change the adjustment of the track , etc. , until both clocks start when O'A ' passes underneath OA . The clock at 0 remains fixed in the laboratory , and since we have assumed that O'A ' is shorter than OA so that A ' passes closer to the x axis than A , we shall certainly see the red flash arrive first. * Thus the face of the oscilloscope clock at 0 will first show the arrival of the red flash ( an optical filter identifies its redness , at the moment of arrival , and automatically causes an extra , identifying mark to appear beside the actual deflection ) and later show the arrival of the green flash . Still describing the operation of the equipment from the standpoint of the laboratory ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is located somewhere down the track when it receives the first light flash and still further down the track when it receives the second light flash ( extreme right-hand diagram , Fig. 4-7a ) . Without even knowing exactly where 0 ' was ( in the laboratory ) at the moment it received the first flash and the second , we can see that the order of reception is the same as for the fixed clock ; In a vucuutn , the velocity of light in nuarurcd to be independent of wavelength .  | that is , the red flash arrives first . This follows , since it is plain that the path from A ' to the moving clock when it receives the red flash is shorter than the path from A to the moving clock when it receives the green flash . Thus , both the moving and the rest instruments agree that the red flash arrives first , and both sets of instruments yield the result that O'A ' is shorter than OA . Should this result occur , we should have to conclude that if a rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter . If this is so , a rod moving in the ? x direction must become longer . This follows from Fig. 4-7b , in which we let rod OA move in the ? x direction with the velocity v. This is exactly the same experiment ( as in Fig. 4-7a ) ? we have merely drawn the diagram with O'A ' fixed and OA moving to the left with the same speed , v. The relative motion of the two rods is identical . Both sets of instruments , therefore , must yield the same result as in Fig. 7-4a : The red flash arrives first . If a rod moving in the +x direction becomes shorter than one to which , at rest , it was exactly equal and if a rod moving in the ? x direction becomes longer , we have discovered a way to tell absolute direction in space without looking at any object outside the laboratory ! But this , of course , violates the postulate that we can not measure velocity ( either direction or magnitude ) with respect to empty space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are forced to conclude ? that O'A " when traveling in the +x direction can not be shorter than OA . Next , we suppose that O'A ' , when moving in the +x direction , is longer than OA . A similar argument leads us once again to the conclusion that , if this lengthening occurred , we could determine direction of motion with respect to empty space . We are forced , therefore , to discard this new assumption and to conclude that the moving rod and the rod at rest must be exactly equal . Then A ' goes exactly under A , the red and green flashes are emitted at the same instant and at the same point in space , with the result that the two pulses arrive together at both the moving and the rest clocks . Only this conclusion will deny us the possibility of determining absolute direction of motion . After the experiment is over , we look at the clock faces and see the exactly superimposed red and green signals , located , in each case , by the time necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single coincidence A'A ' to each of the clocks , one at 0 and one at 0 ' . After a laborious argument , we have arrived at a simple but very important result : Uniform relative velocity along the x axis does not affect length measured perpendicular to it ; that is YoYo ( 4-6a ) and , similarly , = zo ( 4-6b ) These relationships are essential to the further development of the consequences of the theory . It is true , of course , that we have arrived at the above conclusion through the use of a gedanken experiment . To perform this experiment literally very  | high velocities would be required ( 0.1 c would be desirable ) , and this is quite impractical . The experiment is consistent with all we know about physical laws and serves , therefore , as a guide to reasoning , but it is only on the results of real-laboratory experiments that theories stand or fall . Individual features of the theory sometimes can not be tested in isolation ; then only the combination of several features will permit predictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference fringe in an eyepiece , the location of a line on a photographic plate , the number of counts in the register of a given particle detector , etc . The present result will play a key role in the analysis of the next gedanken experiment the measurement of the same time interval in two systems in uniform relative motion ? and this experiment does lead to predictions about physically realizable experiments . We shall be able to make a prediction about the number of counts in a real-laboratory particle detector as it is moved to various positions along the x axis . Needless to say , the prediction of the variation of the counts with distance agrees with the theory of relativity and not with the classical concepts of time measurement . Einstein 's theory predicted the phenomenon of time dilatation in 1905 , but it was not until more than 30 years had elapsed that physics progressed to the point where a direct test was possible . As we have pointed out before , it is the ability of a theory to predict completely new experimental results and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincingly . Rather than try to defend the validity of the results of the above gedanken experiment , we shall assume their truth , and use them in the further development of the theory . The theory as a logical unit will stand or fall on its over-all ability to agree with experiments . 4.5 The Measurement of Time at Distant Points We have already seen how a simple clock can measure directly the time between two point events that occur at the clock . The time of flight of the light packet from 0 to a mirror and back , as in Fig. 4-6 , is an example of this " pure " time measurement . Such a time interval is called a proper time interval . In the next section , 4.6 , we shall need to measure the time interval between two events that do not occur at the same point in an inertial frame . The problem arises of how to measure such a time interval uniquely . A very short pulse of light will originate at 0 in the laboratory frame and , after reflection from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distant point ( along the +x axis ) . The time interval to be measured begins at 0 and ends at a distant point . We shall measure it with automatic instruments . It is necessary here , and in some of the experiments to be described later , that a whole array of clocks be placed at fixed locations along the I x axis , as shown in Fig. 4-8a . For reasons to be explained later , we shall he interested only in the reading recorded on one of the clock faces , clock K , for example ;  | so we shall direct our attention to this particular clock in the subsequent diagrams of Fig. 4-8 . As a simple example of the measurement of the time interval between two spatially separated events , we shall observe the time interval that starts at the origin 0 ( Fig. 4-8 ) , with the emission of a short pulse of light and ends at ( a ) Light pulse starts out from  | clock 8 located at x = x8 with the reception of the same pulse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals of this type , Einstein proposed the following operation : Calculate the time interval in terms of the distance traveled by a light pulse between the two spatially separated points . For example , if we define the instant a light pulse leaves 0 ( Fig. 4-8a ) as t = 0 , then the pulse is defined to arrive at A at the time t = yo/c , as in Fig. 4-8b . Similarly , the same pulse ( spreading radially from 0 ) is defined to arrive at clock 8 at the time t = x8/c ( Fig. 4-8c ) . Finally ( assuming no delay in re-radiation , in agreement with experiment ) , the re-radiated or reflected pulse from A is defined to arrive at clock 8 at the time t = ( ) Io + r8 ) /c , since yo + r8 is the total distance traveled by the light pulse . We see , then , that the straight-line distance traveled by a light pulse divided by the universally constant velocity of light , c , is the time difference between two spatially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light pulse from 0 , and ( 2 ) the reception of the light pulse at the distant point . Since the laboratory operations involved in measuring this newly defined type of time are different from those involved in measuring the time interval between two events occurring at the same point ( the proper time ? see the first paragraph of this section ) , it is necessary that the new type of time be given a different name . When a time interval , or even part of it , is calculated from a distance measurement , that time interval is called nonproper . Conceptually , proper and nonproper time are different things , since they refer to different operations in the laboratory . We now return to the problem of measuring the nonproper time interval between the emission of a light pulse from 0 and the reception at clock 8 of the re-radiated pulse from A. We now assume that we do not know where A is at the time the original pulse arrives , but , nonetheless , we wish to measure the time of arrival of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start upon the arrival of the initial pulse coming directly from O. Using the distancedefined time , we say that clock 8 starts at t = x8/c . Later , by clock-defined time , the re-radiated pulse arrives at clock 8 and is recorded . Let t8 be the ( proper ) time at clock 8 between the arrival of the original pulse and the reradiated pulse ( both of these events occur at the same point in space ) . The interval Lit between the emission of the pulse at 0 and the reception of the re-radiated pulse at the distant point x = x8 ( the location of clock 8 ) is defined as Zit = t8 + x8 ( 4-7 ) x8 is the location of clock 8 along the x axis , and t8 is the pure time reading , in seconds , recorded on its face . We add the extra time x8/c to the clock reading , since the clock starts late by this amount . The time interval Lit in ( 4-7 ) is a combination of a pure distance measurement . r8 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ( 4-7 ) is calculated front t .1 : L L ... . t ir vaned u nnn Aru Arr tittle  | interval . In terms of actual laboratory operations , dt , as defined by ( 4-7 ) , is a completely unambiguous quantity . The ( fixed ) location of clock 8 along the meter stick lying on the x axis is read with the same numerical result by all possible observers . The permanent time marker on the scale of the clock 8 along the meter stick lying on the x axis is read with the same numerical result by all possible observers . The permanent time marker on the scale of the clock face is also observed to have a particular location by all possible observers . Thus , the quantity Lit is as objective as any experimental quantity can be . It is the use of the particular c = 3 X 108 meters per sec as the yard-stick for distance-measured time that gives this number such a fundamental position in the theory of relativity . It is not merely that this number is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the standard of time measurement as well . Suppose that an array of clocks , each in a known fixed position , are all started by a single light pulse coming from a given point O. Let ri be the distance of the ith clock from the point O. Then , if each clock is set back by a time rile , the clocks are said to be synchronized , and all read the same time , usually called coordinate time or , sometimes , laboratory time . 4.6 The Measurement of the Same Time Interval in Two Systems with Uniform Relative Motion We wish to locate two distinctive events in each of two reference systems and to measure the time interval between the events using two different sets of instruments : the rest instruments and the moving instruments . The basic technique is the same as that already described the two systems are permitted to communicate information only over infinitesimally small distances and with signals of infinitesimal duration . We can then be absolutely sure that the two events are really the same . For example , consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-box spark generator in the O'O coincidence in Fig. 4-7 that we discussed above . The appearance of the flash is communicated with negligible time delay to both systems , and its location in space on the meter-stick scales ( which are lying along the coordinate axes ) is always a sharp point ? in both systems . Thus the 0 ' 0 coincidence is a true common event in both systems . Fig. 4-9a shows the moving rod O'A ' moving normal to its length and approaching the rest rod OA with the constant velocity v. The two rods are equal when compared at rest . A light flash is to be generated by the coincidence of O'O , and this flash is to be the beginning of the time interval that will be measured with both sets of instruments  --  one set at rest with respect to the moving rod ( ) ' . I ' and the other set at rest with respect to rod ( ) A ( the laboratory set ) . We first analyze the experiment from the standpoint of the moving instru-  | ments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4-9b the 00 ' coincidence actually occurs , and the moving clock that is riding along with O'A ' starts running . This clock was one of many identical clocks ( compared at rest in the laboratory ) but , since it is now moving in the laboratory , we are not sure that it operates precisely as it did when it was at rest . In Fig. 4-9c the light pulse is mirror The measurement of a proper time interval described in the moving system . The time interval starts in ( b ) with the coincidence of O'O and terminates in ( e ) upon the reception of the light pulse back at 0 ' , the same space point in the moving system at which the first event occurred . on its way to the mirror . In Fig. 4-9d , the pulse arrives at the mirror at A ' , and we know it is reflected , even though there are no instruments at A ' to record any feature of the reflection process , since it reappears at 0 ' , in Fig. 4-9e . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this time , and , since v =-= constant and also since the rod OA is assumed to be in an inertial frame , the moving system must be an inertial frame as well . Thus , according to the basic postulates , the spreading ring of light emanating from O ' may be imagined to be a sphere ( since it travels in all directions with a constant velocity e 3 ? I ( N ' meters veer sec ) as measured by the rod v. : and the clock nerving with it . We say  | " imagined to he a sphere " because its real , in-flight form can not in fact be observed . Its in-flight form can only be inferred from the readings of clocks and the positions of pointers on meter sticks , etc . One of the cardinal rules of scientific philosophy , known as Occam 's razor , states that one should always use the simplest assumptions needed to account for observations . The paths of the planets across the celestial sphere , no matter how complex , can be accounted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , more simply , by assuming that they are committed to a pattern of cycles and epicycles , or , even more simply still , by Newton 's laws of motion , gravitation , and heliocentricity . We should accept Newton 's theory for no other reason than that its ordering of planetary observations employs the fewest arbitrary assumptions . Newton 's theory has , of course , the additional virtue of explaining many observations besides planetary motion , but it can be recognized immediately as the most satisfactory theory on the basis of planetary observations alone . Using , therefore , Occam 's principle of the economy of postulates , we may slice away all nonessential mental images about the shape of the light pulse spreading out from 0 ' , since these mental images do not lead to any new real-life observations . Indeed , the memory of the observations of water waves spreading in neat circles from their point of origin in the medium now does us great disservice , for , as we shall see shortly , light waves can not be doing anything so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine what the light pulse is doing as it travels between one observation point and the next . The heart of the mystery of relativity lies in the " unnatural " manner in which light pulses seem to get from one point to another in space . From here on , we shall merely use the indubitable fact established by the MichelsonMorley experiment : that a light pulse , when observed entirely within an inertial frame , acts as if it were a spreading spherical ring . We shall make no effort to imagine what it is really like . Returning to the problem of calculating the time reading recorded on the face of the moving clock at 0 ' , we know that the frame in which O'A ' is at rest is inertial and that , in any such frame , the velocity of light is always c = 3 X l08 meters per sec . Also , the time interval measured was the interval between two events that occurred at the same place in the inertial frame . This type of time interval measurement has been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time is this : the two events occurred at the same spatial point in an inertial frame and were recorded by a single clock at rest at that point . An inertial reference frame in which a particle is at rest , even momentarily , is called a proper frame , and , in general , measurements made on the particle with respect to this frame are called proper measurements . Measurements made on a moving particle are , in general , nonproper measurements . Returning to Fig. 4-9e , we ask : What is the reading on the persistent screen of the recording oscilloscope clock ? Suppose that yo ' was a meter stick . Then , as Fig. 4-9e shows , the clock will read 10 " sec , since we postulate that , for all inertial frames , the velocity of light as measured within the frame  | In Fig. 4-10b the O'O coincidence occurs , and the light pulse starts out . Since the rest system ( the laboratory ) is also an inertial frame , we know that light will spread out from 0 as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 0 , and we see it thus , in Fig. 4-10c . It is indeed fortunate at this point that we have Occam 's razor to save us from the vain attempt to imagine the same " thing " spreading simultaneously in a spherical pattern from both 0 and 0 ' . ( Remember : To explain the Michelson-Morley experiment we need treat only one inertial frame at a time . We do not have to visualize what the pulse of light waves ? whatever it may consist of ? is actually doing . ) In Fig. 4-10d , we see ( or rather imagine ) the arrival of the light at A ' where a re-radiated wave is initiated . This wave returns in the general direction of the x axis Fig. 4-10e , where ( Fig. 4-10f ) the light pulse arrives at 0 ' , which by now has moved some distance to the right of O. We have already discussed the reception of this light flash on the clock riding along with 0 ' . We have also provided additional instruments traveling with 0 ' which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will generate a new light flash at 0 ' . Arrayed at rest along the x axis awaiting this eventuality are a whole row of clocks ( there are many clocks in a continuous array along the x axis , and they are very small ) . The one clock that happens to be nearest 0 ' receives this new light signal and has an " x " marked upon its face . Note that the communication between the two systems is once again effected by a short flash of light over a negligibly small spatial distance and , therefore , can be uniquely located in both coordinate systems . In the example in Fig. 4-10f , we see that clock number 8 was marked . ( We do not know ahead of time just where 0 ' will be when it receives its flash , so we have many clocks available in a row . However , once we know which of the rest clocks was located at the point where 0 ' received its flash , we may concentrate upon this one , since " it was there when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the terminating event of the time interval . ) Although clock 8 was present at the termination of the time interval being measured , it was not present at the 00 ' coincidence that started the time interval . The time interval between these two spatially separated events ( a nonproper time interval ) is measured using the method of the previous section ( 4.5 ) . In Fig. 4-10g , the light pulse that was formed at the 00 ' coincidence travels along the - E- x axis along the array of rest clocks , and each clock , in turn , starts as it receives the pulse . Thus clock 8 started at a time calculated from the transit time of light , x8/c . At this time , the pulse was at the point P ( see Fig. 4-9g ) , en route to the mirror . Clock 8 then runs while the light goes from P up to the mirror , down to 0 ' , and , simultaneously , to clock 8 . Clock 8 directly receives the reflected pulse from the mirror at A ' as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that identifies it as the clock actually located at the point in space where the event occurred that terminated the time interval. * As Fig. 4-10h  | All possible observers will read the same numbers for y0 , x8 , and t8 ; so , all will compute the same value for At . Similarly , the proper time interval At ' , which is simply the reading permanently recorded on the face of the ( moving ) clock at 0 ' , is read by all possible observers to have one unique value . But , by the experiment of Fig. 4-7 , we obtained the result that distance measured normal to the direction of relative motion is unchanged ; that is , by ( 4-6a ) ,  | This is the famous time dilatation of the theory of relativity . It relates the proper time interval At ' , which is recorded on the face of the clock at 0 ' , to the nonproper time interval At , which is computed from : ( 1 ) the recorded time on a laboratory clock face ( clock 8 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( 3 ) the distance yo where the moving mirror made the transit of the y axis . These two time intervals At ' and At are defined by the same pair of point , space-time events . One is measured entirely by instruments moving with O'A ' and the other entirely by instruments at rest in the laboratory . We should re-emphasize the significance of the fact that the time interval being measured is bounded by point , space-time events , since only events of this type can be unambiguously located in any reference frame . A very shortduration spark , leaping between two closely spaced electrodes is an example of a point , space-time event . It makes no difference whether the electrodes are both at rest , both moving , or one at rest and the other moving ; if the spark has very small spatial extent and very small duration , it will appear as a point in space and an instant in time in all inertial frames ( and even in accelerated frames ) . To say that a clock in a distant space ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clock on earth is a meaningless statement ? unless the ticks of both clocks can be uniquely and unambiguously located in each of the two inertial frames . In example 5 below , we discuss the problem of observing point , space-time events in an orbiting satellite and accurately locating them with respect to the earth . Let us now return to a discussion of the profound significance of Eq . ( 4-14 ) . This equation tells us that At , the time interval inferred by the rest instruments , is larger than At ' ; therefore the expression " time dilatation . " For example , let yo = ya = 1 meter , and let v = lc ; then the rest instruments measure the two point , space-time events to be separated in time by the amount At = At = 3 x 10 ? 8 = 1.15 X x 10 ? 8 sec 1/1 ? fl2 V1 ? ( 2 ) 2 a dilatation of 15 percent compared with the proper time measurement made by the single clock at 0 ' that was present at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The postulates of relativity ( All the laws of physics are identical in all inertial frames , including the constancy of the velocity of light . It is impossible to devise an experiment that will detect a state of absolute motion. ) lead us to  | the conclusion that moving instruments measure the same time interval with a different numerical result from rest instruments ! The readings on the clocks faces and the locations of all the clocks with respect to their own coordinate systems are fixed and permanent . These scale readings can be examined at any time by any observer ( even when looking through a distorted optical system ) , moving in any type of system ( accelerated or not ) , and the same readings will always be obtained . There is no doubt that the moving instruments and the rest instruments disagree , and all observers agree that the instruments disagree ! Time is not some universal thing that flows on uniformly for all , but is a relative quantity , dependent on the state of motion of the instruments that measure it . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the time-dilatation equation ( 4-14 ) was derived for the particular case in which the time of flight of a pulse of light is used to form the time interval , one can readily see that the results must apply to all types of timeinterval-generating devices . In the moving frame at point 0 ' let there be a small mechanical clock and also a mirror . Let the original light pulse echo back and forth between 0 ' and A ' , generating uniformly spaced time markers every 3 x 10-8 sec . Suppose , for simplicity , that the clock ticked once in this same interval . The clock and the echoing light pulse would then keep in exact time ( proper time , in both cases ) , and any conclusions reached about the nonproper measurement of the interval between the light pulses would also have to apply to the exactly identical interval between the ticks of the mechanical clock . Thus the moving mechanical clock which reads proper time in its own frame would appear to run slow when compared with rest instruments in the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the use of the rest instruments will again involve a combination of pure distance measurement and time measurement . The fact that the nonproper time interval computed from the measurements of the laboratory , or rest , instruments is different from the pure , or proper , time interval directly measured at the mechanical clock should not really surprise us , since the two types of measurement involve different operations , as follows : ( 1 ) To measure the proper time interval Lit ' , ( a ) Read the recorded time interval on the face of the clock at 0 ' . This reading is the proper time interval . ( 2 ) To measure the nonproper time interval LA ( a ) Read yo , the point where A ' crossed the y axis , or , alternatively , read the location of A ' against the calibrations on the y ' axis . Both give the same number . ( b ) Read the location of the marked clock ( number 8 in the example ) against the calibration scale on the x axis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of the marked clock ( t ? , in the example ) . Considered by itself , this clock reading is a proper time interval . Both events occurred at the clock .  | From these observations of fixed pointers and from the measured value of the velocity of light ( which measures the same in all inertial reference frames ) one calculates the nonproper time interval using ( 4-13b ) . This detailed comparison of laboratory operations makes it clear that the actual determination of proper and nonproper time involve very different activities on the part of the observer and that one is justified in summarizing these two sets of operations in different words : proper time , and nonproper time . 4.7 The Experimental Observation of Time Dilatation The remarkable conclusion that moving instruments measure a time interval differently than instruments at rest in the laboratory has been an integral part of the theory of relativity since 1905 . It was only after 30 years or more , however , that it was possible to test the principle by direct experiments . The phenomenon is most dramatically shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered in the late 1930s and the 1940s . These particles have a very distinctive decay time when observed at rest in the laboratory ( proper time ) , but , when set in motion at very high velocity ? nearly the velocity of light they act as if their characteristic decay time were much longer . The effect is very large , and it is in agreement with the predictions of the theory . The laboratory operations are different in some details from those of the gedanken experiment of the previous section , in which the time of flight of a light pulse formed the measured time interval , but the result is the same . This gives experimental proof that the principle of time dilatation is a general one . Rather than go directly to the meson experiments , we shall first analyze a simpler ( imaginary ) case which illustrates the principles involved in the measurements . We shall call it " The Case of the Disappearing Clocks . " We first manufacture a large number of identical clocks which can be started by a light pulse but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces ; that is , after a ( proper ) time interval of 10-8 sec they disappear . Now , one at a time , we set them in uniform motion in the laboratory with a velocity v directed along the +x axis , as in Fig. 4-11a . Each clock is started by a light pulse automatically generated by the clock 's passing 0 ( Fig. 4-11b ) . They all continue along the x axis while they are running , as in Fig. 4-11c . Finally , they automatically explode at xe , as in Fig. 4-11d . We wish to measure xa , so that ( knowing v ) we can infer their running time before explosion . We shall place along the x axis a clock detector , which records the arrival of an unexploded clock but which is unaffected by the fragments of an exploded clock . If the detector is placed closer to 0 than x , ; , it will record the arrival of all the clocks , but , if it is placed at a greater distance than x , , , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the x axis where the counting rate suddenly drops to zero  | figure identifies the end of the time interval that began when the clock crossed the y axis at O. This nonproper time interval is Zit = V ( 4-15 ) The measurement of v can he carried out in the manner shown in Fig. 4-12 . A rest clock ( clock 2 ) placed at x @#@ xe uses the signal produced by the arrival of a clock at the adjacent clock detector to produce a deflection . Clock 2 is started in the usual manner by the arrival from 0 of the light pulse that was generated by the moving clock at the instant it passed O. The time of flight of the moving clock is xo/c H- to , where to is the pure-time reading of clock 2 ; so the measured velocity of the moving clock is  | All the quantities on the right of ( 4-17 ) are directly measurable . The proper time interval ( between the starting and the exploding of any of the identical moving clocks ) has already been measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame is inertial , this would be the reading on a measuring clock moving with the exploding clock . The two clocks start together , and the measuring clock records on its face the time of demise of the exploding clock . Thus , the recorded time interval on the moving clock is Lit ' = 10 ? 8 sec ( 4-18 ) This is a proper time measurement , since it was measured at one point by a clock at rest with respect to the exploding clock . In contrast , we note that the nonproper time interval At in ( 4-17 ) is ( as is also the case in the gedanken experiment ) a combination of space measurement ( location of objects along a distance scale ) and time measurement ( clock  | readings ) . The theory ( 4-14 ) tells us that the time interval measured by the laboratory instruments should be larger than 10 " sec . Let us take an example in which the measured velocity of the moving clocks is 0.99 c. * If time dilatation did not exist , then all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 x 108 ) ( 10 ? 8 ) = 2.97 meters If , on the other hand , time dilatation does exist , then ( 4-14 ) requires that the moving clocks explode at a xe = ( 0.99 X 3 x 108 ) 1 v1 0.992 = 21.3 meters At these high velocities , the consequences of time dilatation are very large , since , before exploding , the moving clocks would travel about 7 times the distance one would expect from the measured behavior of the clocks at rest and the nonrelativistic theory . Quantitative support for the predictions of the theory is given by the decay properties of two types of mesons , p. and 7r . These subatomic particles , when brought to rest , decay exponentially at a distinctive rate instead of all decaying ( exploding ) after a sharply defined interval as in the case discussed above . The IT mesons have the decay curve shown in Fig. 4-13 . If , at t = 0 , there are 1,000 mesons present , it is found experimentally that , after a time interval of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reduced to l/e* times the original number ; that is , in this time interval , very nearly 632 will decay ( explode into fragments ) leaving about 368 unexploded . After a second time interval of 2.6 x 10-8 sec , the surviving mesons are down to about ( 1/e ) x 368 = 135 , and a similar attenuation occurs for each successive time interval . The number of 7T mesons surviving after time At is N = Noe t/ ( 2. sxto-e ) t = proper time ( 4-19 ) where N8 is the number in existence at the beginning of the time interval , that is , at t = 0 . These mesons can be produced by the impact of a short burst of highenergy particles or gamma rays on a target , and they travel in a beam along which meson detectors are located . The detectors measure the number of mesons ? in the unexploded state ? that reach various distances along the beam . It has been observed experimentally that the 7r-meson decay rate based on attentuation with distance agrees with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Typically , a beam of 7r mesons will travel 30 meters and have only a modest attenuation due to decay . These mesons have a high energy and are traveling at about 0.99 times the velocity of light . The meson velocity can be measured directly as in Fig. 4-12 , since a pulse of light ( gamma rays ) is also produced when the mesons are formed . It is usually simpler , however , to determine the velocity by other means ? such as measuring the curvature of the path in a magnetic field . We place a meson detector first at zero distance along the beam and then at 30 meters along the beam , and observe the number of mesons per second detected in each case . What , according to the theory of relativity , should the ratio of the two counting rates be ? First , we note that , for the 30-meter path , the mesons have a measured transit time of d t = 30/ ( 0.99 x 3 x 108 ) = 10.1 x 10-8 sec . This time , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , nonproper time . The proper time d t ' ( which would be measured by a clock moving along with the pack of mesons ) corresponding to the nonproper time interval dt = 10.1 x 10-8 sec is , by ( 4-14 ) , At ' = V1 ? ( v/c ) 2 dt = 1/1 ? 0.992 x 10.1 x 10-8 = 0.14 x 10.1 x 10-8 = 1.4 x 10-8 sec The decay curve of Fig. 4-13 shows that , after this proper time interval , about half of the original mesons will survive , in agreement with the laboratory observations . Thus , if 1,000 mesons per sec are observed at x = 0 , about 500 per sec will be observed at x = 30 meters. * e is the natural of logarithms , base 2.718 ; so 1/e = 0.368. t R. I ' . Durbin , II .

For the mesons in these experiments , v 0.75c , and V1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | What would have occurred if time dilatation did not exist ? In the transit time of 10.1 x 10 8 sec , the mesons would have had their numbers reduced by a factor of nearly ( 1/e ) 4 , or - 15 . Thus , the number surviving to reach the 30-meter point would have been only 18 out of 1,000 . Experimentally , about 500 survive , in agreement with relativity . The predictions of nonrelativistic theory are incorrect by a large factor . The meson experiment has the unique characteristic of testing very directly ' the predictions of one of the key transformation equations in special relativity . We really do have moving clocks with a natural ticking rate . They can indeed be caused to move in the laboratory at very high velocities , and they can communicate information to the rest instruments across infinitesimal distances and over negligibly small time intervals . We do not really know why they decay as they do . We do not imagine them to be sending light signals back and forth between mirrors ( as in the gedanken experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these tiny clocks do obey the laws of relativity and do show that the theory of time dilatation is very basic and general , not dependent upon the particular form of the gedanken experiment used in its derivation . We have used the expression " time dilatation " many times ; time dilatation occurs when the nonproper time interval between two events is larger than the proper time interval between the same two events . The meson experiments exhibit this effect ; they ( and many other experiments* ) have demonstrated that moving instruments and rest instruments measure the same time interval differently . In the next section we shall examine another basic operation : the measurement of length parallel to the direction of motion . This will complete the set of fundamental relationships connecting measurements of the four kinematical quantities ( the three spatial distance intervals , and the time interval ) as measured in two different inertial frames . 4.8 The Measurement of the Same Length in Two Systems with Uniform Relative Motion Parallel to the Length We have seen in Sec. 4.4 that rods that are identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when placed in relative motion perpendicular to their length . We now analyze the case in which the rods are in relative motion parallel to their length . Rather than attempt to compare a moving rod directly with a rod at rest in the laboratory , we shall * The characteristic frequencies of vibration f for moving atomic and nuclear structures ( as revealed through the associated electromagnetic radiation ) have been observed to be lower by the amount d f , than for the same structures observed at rest , where Af/f = 1 ? 1/1 ? v2/c2 v2/2c2 , in accordance with the time-dilatation relationship . See Ives and Stillwell , J. Optical Soc . Am. , 28 , 215 ( 1938 ) , and Hay , Schiffer , Cranshaw , and Egelstaff , Phys . Rev. Letters , 4 , 164 ( 1960 ) .  | first perform the simpler task of using light signals as a tool for measuring the length of the moving rod . We shall perform a new gedanken experiment using a rod whose length ( measured by meter sticks at rest with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a proper length . With the aid of light signals we shall then determine the length of the same moving rod using instruments that are at rest in the laboratory . Fig. 4-14 shows the rod set into motion in the +x direction and carrying a clock at 0 ' and a mirror at M ' . As 0 ' crosses the y axis of the rest system , a light pulse is generated which instantly starts the clock at 0 ' . We wish to reflect this light pulse off the mirror M ' and return it to 0 ' , and , by its time of flight , measure the ( known ) length of the rod in the moving system . Although Fla. 4-14 The rod of proper length x'o carrying the mirror M ' moves to the right in the laboratory with the velocity v. What is the length measured by the laboratory instruments ? ( See Fig. 4-15 for the detailed analysis. ) the length O 'M ' can plainly be read on the meter sticks moving with it , we choose the light-pulse method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 0 ' are point-events in space-time and can , therefore , be clearly located in the laboratory , or rest , system . It is from the permanent records produced by these two point-events in the rest-system instruments that we shall he able to infer the length x ? of the moving rod as measured by the rest instruments . We begin by analyzing the simple problem of the measurement of the length of the rod in the moving system using a light pulse . Fig. 4-15 shows the rod at rest and the laboratory moving to the left with a velocity v. The only function performed by the moving laboratory is to trigger a light pulse at 0 ' when the y axis of the laboratory , located at 0 , passes underneath it . The y axis quickly disappears to the left and is of no further interest in this part of the problem . The sequence of diagrams in Fig. 4-15 is just the standard inertial-frame observation . A light pulse spreads spherically from 0 ' , arrives at the mirror M ' , and again spreads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' where it is recorded on the clock face . The clock reads the proper time interval Lit ' , and , since the ( vacuum ) velocity of light in all inertial frames a is always exactly c , we at once calculate the length of the rod from  | The distance xo is , of course , just the fixed location of M ' on the meter sticks which are moving along with the rod . We could have read the location of M ' without even doing the experiment with the light signal and the clock . As we have explained above , however , we shall need the pulsed light signals to make point , space-time events that are also uniquely obserable with the rest-system instruments . figure  | What distance x0 do the laboratory , or rest , instruments measure as the separation between 0 ' and M ' ? This measurement operation is analyzed with the aid of the sequence of diagrams in Fig. 4-16 . In a we see 0 ' approach the y axis of the rest system , and in b a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is moving along with 0 ' , and also spreads out ahead to 0 ' , as in c , finally catching up with the mirror M ' in d , at t = t1 . As can be seen directly from Fig. 4-16d , ( 4-20 ) where xo is still an unknown distance as far as the rest instruments are concerned . The light pulse reflects from M ' and spreads outward in a spherical shell ( Fig. 4-16e ) from the point in the laboratory where the reflected pulse was formed , finally arriving back at 0 ' ( Fig. 4-16f ) . Upon arrival at 0 ' , the moving clock instantly generates a special light signal , which it sends downward to a row of rest clocks previously arrayed along the x axis , marking thereby in the rest coordinate frame the exact location of 0 ' at the instant that 0 ' received the reflected pulse from M ' . In Fig. 4-16f and g , clock 11 is marked with an " x . " Thus , as in the case of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location of the beginning and the ending of a single time interval uniquely located in both coordinate frames . The time t2 , marking ( in the rest frame ) the termination of the common time interval , will now be calculated . At t = t1 ( Fig. 4-16d ) , the reflected light pulse is xo meters from 0 ' , but 0 ' is moving to the right with a velocity v , and the reflected light pulse is moving to the left with a velocity c . The time elapsed from reflection at M ' ( t = t1 ) to reception at 0 ' ( t = t2 ) is given , therefore , by ( t2 ? t1 ) ( c + v ) = xo ( 4-21 ) t2 is the total time ( as measured with the laboratory instruments ) that has elapsed between the initial transmission from the 0'O coincidence to the final reception back at 0 ' . Thus t2 is simply d t , the nonproper time interval corresponding to the proper time interval ( 4-19 ) , At , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrival of the light pulse at the mirror II'I ' , is not directly observable , so we eliminate t1 between ( 4-20 ) and ( 4-21 ) , obtaining t2 =zit = 2x ? 1 1 v2/c2 ( 4-23 ) From Fig. 4-15 we see that t2 = x11/c 4- t11 and v = x11/t2i so , if we solve for the unknown xo , ( 4-23 ) becomes xo = ( ct2/2 ) ( 1 ? v2/c2 ) , or figure  | figure  | In this equation , all the terms on the right are fixed-pointer readings that can be observed at any time after the end of the experiment . They permit the calculation of the effective length xo that the rest instruments measure between 0 ' and the mirror M ' . We note that this distance measurement is a combination of actual distance measurements and clock readings and is called nonproper , whereas the proper distance xo is simply the fixed location of M ' on the meter sticks traveling with the moving system . The latter measurement is a pure distance measurement ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time interval Jt ' ) . In either case , the proper distance xo is measured with instruments at rest with respect to the object being observed , and the nonproper distance xo is measured with instruments that are not at rest with respect to the object being observed . It is not obvious from ( 4-24 ) what xo will turn out to be in comparison with xo , but we can use the time-dilatation relationship ( 4-14 ) dt =4t1/1 ? N2 = c to make a bridge between the proper-time-interval measurement ( 4-22 ) and the corresponding nonproper-time measurement for the identical interval , given by ( 4-23 ) ; that is , 2xo = 2xo 1 1/1 ? gs C c 1 ? g2 At ' At or xo=xo ' /1 ? g2 v =- c ( 4-25 ) We see , then , that the laboratory , or rest , instruments measure a shorter distance between 0 ' and M ' than do the moving instruments . For example , if xo = 1 meter and v = 0.99c , the readings of the rest instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 4-24 ) would give the result xo = 0.14 meter . This result is most readily calculated , however , directly from ( 4-25 ) . To the rest instruments , the meter stick would appear to be contracted . ' This fundamental relativistic relationship was originally proposed by Lorentz and Fitzgerald as an essentially ad hoc explanation for the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment . They postulated that the whole apparatus contracted , along the direction of the " ether wind , " by just the amount needed for the " slow echo " ? that is , the echo that had to travel down and up the stream ? to get back in exact time coincidence with the " fast echo " that traveled across the stream . Although the equation here derived is the same as that proposed by Lorentz ? and Fitzgerald , the significance of the terms is very different . In the light of the postulates of relativity , the Michelson-Morley experiment is done entirely with proper measurements , since all the instruments are at rest , and no question arises about any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirrors and light source . There is a sharp contrast between the ad hoc Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction hypothesis and the profound and farreaching principle that uniform motion with respect to empty space can not be detected . It is important to note that , if the rod O 'M ' of Fig. 4-15 were moving to the left with the velocity v , the analysis would be basically the same as above , and the same length contraction ( 4-25 ) would result . That is , as measured by instruments that are at rest , rods moving in either the negative or the positive x direction contract the same amount . This result is also reflected by the presence of v2 in the length-contraction equation ( and in the time-dilatation equation ) . Neither length contraction nor time dilatation will permit the absolute direction of relative motion to be discerned . In the analysis of the relative lengths of rods moving with uniform velocity normal to their length ( Sec. 4.4 ) , we noted that , if a rod moving to the right was shorter than the rod at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . Such behavior would permit the determination of the absolute direction of relative motion and would , therefore , violate the postulates of relativity . Our conclusion in that case was that the two rods must be equal . One might ask respecting the analysis in Sec. 4.4 why a rod moving normal to its laboratory velocity could not be postulated to be shorter whether it moved to the left or right ( this actually occurs for the case of motion parallel to the length , as we have just seen . The difference between the behavior of rods in motion perpendicular to the length and parallel to the length ( Fig. 4-7 , as compared with Fig. 4-16 ) is simple but very important . In the hypothetical case of Fig. 4-7 both sets of instruments measure a particular rod , O'A ' , to be shorter . Thus it " really is " shorter . In the physically correct case of Fig. 4-16 , the laboratory instruments measure rod O 'M ' to be shorter than an identical rod OM ( not shown in Fig. 4-16 ) at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instruments moving with O 'M ' measure it to be longer than the rod OM . Thus , instead of the two sets of instruments agreeing that a particular rod is shorter , as in Fig. 4-7 , the instruments of Fig. 4-16 disagree about which rod is shorter . The first case ( if it were true ) , with its completely unambiguous determination of which rod is the shorter , would permit the determination of absolute direction . The second case , however , with its complete ambiguity about which rod is " really " the shorter , denies the determination of absolute motion . 4.9 The Relativistic Transformation for Space and Time Intervals . The Lorentz Trans-formation We have derived , using gedanken experiments , the basic relationships between the readings of moving instruments and rest instruments when they refer to the same points in spacetime ; these are  | where the primed system moves at uniform velocity v along the x axis of the unprimed rest system . These equations show that the measurement of both time and distance intervals is dependent upon the relative velocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its motion . These equations are the heart of special relativity . From here on , it is merely a matter of details . The revolution in the concepts of space and time has occurred . ( 4-26 ) is the basis of the Lorentz transformation equations . These basic transformation relationships have a number of consequences which we shall not have the space to discuss in a quantitative manner , but one of them , the relativistic addition of velocities , ought to be mentioned . If object A is moving in the +x direction of the laboratory with a velocity vA = 0.9c and if object B is moving in the ? x direction with the velocity vB = 0.9c , one might think that the relative velocity of A and B would be 1.8c ? which exceeds the velocity of light . This , of course , does not happen . If one refers all the measurements to a single inertial frame moving with A , for example , and uses carefully the basic transformation relationships ( 4-26 ) to the two other frames ( the laboratory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching A at a velocity slightly less than 4.10 The Equivalence of Inertial Frames It is important to note that the equations ( 4-26 ) depend only on the square of the velocity v. Thus , it makes no difference whether the moving system is traveling in the +x direction or the ? x direction with respect to the rest system . The comparison of proper and nonproper measurements can not distinguish the direction in space of the relative-velocity vector . Also , choosing the direction of relative motion to be along the +x axis does not limit the generality of the results , for the orientation of a set of axes inside an inertial frame is completely arbitrary , since inside an inertial frame there is no method by which to prefer one direction over another . * We write dx , dy , and dz , rather than x , y , and z , since in every case the length referred to is the distance interval between two spatial points . t The Lorentz transformation and the relativistic velocity addition are discussed in most textbooks in modern physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennard , and ' I ' . Lauritsen , " Introduction to Modern Physics , " any edition , McGraw-Hill Book Co , Inc. , New York , chap . 2 ; A. P. French , " Principles of Modern Physics , " John Wiley 44 Sons , New York , 1958 , chap . 6 . If particle A has the velocity v with respect to the inertial frame F and if particle B has the velocity w with respect to F , then the relative velocity u of A and B is not v w , but ( v i w ) / ( I + vw/c'l ) .  | Finally , we note that , although we have discussed the gcdankcn experiments in terms of measurements by a set of rest instruments ( the laboratory instruments ) and a set of moving instruments ( which we imagined to he riding on a cart ) , we could obtain equivalent results by calling the moving cart the " rest frame " and regarding the laboratory as moving to the ? x direction with the velocity of magnitude v. To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the measurement of a time interval as in Sec. 4.6 . There , the proper time measurement was made by the cart instrument ( a single clock at O ' ) , and the nonproper time measurement was made by the laboratory instruments ( an array of clocks in the rest frame ) . If we now regard the cart as the rest frame , the laboratory rod OA is moving to the left ( Fig. 4-10 ) , and we need an array of clocks ( along the x ' axis ) on the cart . One of the clocks in this new array is marked at the instant a light flash is received by the single laboratory clock now located at O. The instruments on the cart are now measuring nonproper time , since they infer a time interval by means of a combination of a clock reading ( the marked clock ) and a distance reading ( the distance of the marked clock from 0 ' ) . As a result of our calling the cart the " rest frame , " two things have happened : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling in the negative x direction ; and ( 2 ) we have been forced to use a new set of instruments on the cart for making the nonproper measurements . As we have seen above , however , the sign of the velocity makes no difference to the mathematical relationships deduced , and , therefore , the nonproper time interval measured by the new rest instruments ( the cart instruments ) will be larger than the proper time interval measured by the single laboratory clock located at O. As before , the factor is 1/V1 ? /32 . Thus , whichever system we choose to call the rest system , we obtain the result : ( nonproper time interval ) = 1 ( proper time interval ) . V1 i3a It makes no difference , therefore , which of the two inertial frames we call the rest frame ; the permanently recorded readings of the set of instruments making the nonproper measurements give a calculated time interval that always disagrees by the same factor , 1/A/1 ? /32 , with the time interval obtained from the permanently recorded readings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible that the magnitude of v is not the same in the two cases ? After all , the relative velocity v is always calculated from the readings of the rest instruments , using ( 4-13a ) . Thus , calling the cart the rest frame will force us to measure v with a completely different set of instruments ? the set moving with the cart . The postulates require , however , that we obtain exactly the same numerical value for the relative velocity v. For , if the measured value of the relative velocity v were different , we could then determine an absolute direction of motion ( in violation of the postulates ) . The principle of special relativity forces us to require that all inertial frames  | be equivalent . There can be no possible way to prefer one frame above the other , for , any objectively measurable difference between inertial reference frames would permit the identification of at least the direction of a relativevelocity vector with respect to " empty space . " Indeed , " the complete equivalence of all inertial frames " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special relativity . 4.11 The Dependence of Inertial Mass on Velocity Once having found that the basic measurements of space and time intervals depend upon the motion of the instruments with respect to objects or events being measured , it is not surprising that many of the physical quantities of uniformly moving objects should have different measured values when observed by instruments in the laboratory . The real reason that the quantities are different is rooted in the distorted measurements of space and time that we use in the measurement process . As we shall see in this section , the inertial mass of an object measures larger when it is moving in the laboratory with the velocity v than when it is observed at rest . The cause of this phenomenon is simply time dilatation , but , rather than work out each physical experiment directly from first principles , we shall come to think of the physical quantity mass as actually increasing with velocity . In many cases , it is a great saving in effort to by-pass a detailed analysis of an experiment in terms of the fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in mass . VVe must never forget , however , that the heart of the matter lies in the fundamental differences between proper and nonproper time and distance measurements that follow from the basic postulates of relativity . In order to analyze the inertial qualities of a massive particle moving in the laboratory with a velocity v , we shall perform a gedanken experiment involving a collision between a moving particle and another particle located in the laboratory . We start the experiment with two particles 1 and 2 , which when compared together in any rest frame ( the laboratory , for example ) have identical inertial properties. * For example , they accelerate exactly the same when pulled by a spring with a given extension . Thus , in any given inertial frame ml=m2 This equality is determined by experiment . Also , we require these particles , in collision , to be perfectly elastic . Thus , if the two particles are directed toward each other with equal velocities , as measured with respect to a common inertial frame , after collision each will rebound with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same inertial mass in one inertial frame and different inertial masses in some other inertial frame , this measurement would permit one frame to be distinguished from the other , in violation of the principle of relativity .  | We now place particle 2 in a uniformly moving frame F2 and keep mass 1 in the laboratory frame Fi ( see Fig. 4-17 ) . F2 moves with the velocity v in the 1 x direction of Fl . We wish to perform a collision experiment in the y direction but without interfering with the constant translation in the x direction . In Fig. 4-17a , particle 2 has an ( unknown ) inertial mass m2 , as measured by the laboratory instruments , that is , those instruments in Fl . Our objective is to find the value of m2 . Particle 2 is given a small velocity v2 in the ? y ' direction , as measured in F2 . Particle 1 , whose inertial mass is ml ( as measured in Fl ) is given a small velocity vi in the +y direction , measured in Fl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so chosen that , in Fig. 4-17 , they approach each other in b , collide in c , and rebound elastically in d and e . The y velocities after the collision are ul and u2 , each measured in the reference frame belonging A collision between two particles . When compared in the same frame , the two particles have equal mass. //  | to the particle . In the subsequent discussion , we are concerned with the effect of the collision on the y velocities . The x velocities are unaffected . As a matter of experimental choice ( in gedanken experiments , one always chooses the simplest possible situation ) , we cause the magnitudes of the initial velocities of each particle ( each measured in its own frame ) to be equal ; that is , v1 I = v2 ( 4-27 ) measured in F , measured in F2 If the collision is elastic ( as we are also assuming , for simplicity ) the recoil velocity ul of particle 1 must have the same magnitude as its initial velocity v1 ; that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , particle 1 , as observed in Fl , does not lose energy in the collision . It is then necessary that particle 2 lose no energy either , since , if it did , the two identical inertical frames Fl and F2 , each containing one of the two identical particles , could be distinguished from each other by purely internal measuremeats ? in violation of the principle that all inertial frames are equivalent . ( We have arbitrarily chosen Fl to be the laboratory , or rest frame , but the results of the experiment can not depend upon this choice . ) ' Therefore , in F2 , the magnitude of the final velocity u2 of particle 2 must equal the magnitude of its initial velocity v2 , u2 = v2 both measured in F2 ( 4-29 ) Thus , by ( 4-27 ) , ( 4-28 ) , and ( 4-29 ) , we have the result that the two recoil velocities ul and u2 , each measured in its own frame , have equal magnitudes ; that is , lull = us ( 4-30 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe the experiment entirely in terms of measurements taken in Fl , since this frame has arbitrarily been chosen as the laboratory . The first step is to measure v2 , the initial velocity of particle 2 , with instruments located in F2 , and then to measure the same quantity with instruments located in Fl . In time Lit ' ( in F2 ) particle 2 will have moved a distance of magnitude Ay ' ( in F2 ) in the ? y ' direction , which is perpendicular to the direction of relative motion of Fl and F2 . As measured in F2 , therefore , v2 = dt , measured in F2 ( 4-31 ) provided that v2 e c. * * The velocity of a moving object is not simply a pure distance divided by a pure time measurement , as can be seen by referring to ( 4-16 ) , xo v = ( xo/c ) + to but involves a mixture of time and distance measurements . Thus , Ay ' vy ( dy ' /c ) At ' ( 4-31 ) is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , that is , x ' .2 - c. )  | As measured with the instruments in Ft , the initial velocity of particle 2 is v2 = d t measured in Fl By the basic transformation equations ( 4-26 ) , so , designating by V2 the quantity v2 as measured in Fl , we obtain the the quantity quantity v2 as v2 as measured measured in F1 in F2 By describing the quantity v2 ( they component of the initial velocity of the moving particle as measured in its own inertial frame F2 ) in terms of the laboratory measurements , we have taken a key step . As we shall see Below , it is ( 4-31a ) and its consequence ( 4-32 ) that cause the intertial mass of particle 2 when it is moving to appear larger than m2 , its value measured near zero velocity in any inertial frame . The difference in the two values for v2 ( recorded by the two different sets of instruments ) is directly due to time dilatation . This basic phenomenon , therefore , may be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with velocity , which is computed below. * We continue our analysis of the motion of particle 2 as measured with the instruments in Fl . Before the collision , particle 2 has the velocity v2A/ 1 - 732 in the ? y direction ; therefore , by an identical argument , after the collision particle 2 has the velocity u2-/1 /32 in the - FT direction . But , by ( 4-29 ) , u2 = v2 I ; so dv2 , the change in velocity of particle 2 , as measured in Fl , is dV2=2v2 ' /1 where v2 is measured in F2 . However , by ( 4-27 ) , we stipulated that 1v2=vi measured in F2 measured in F1 and we have , finally , the change in the velocity of particle 2 d V2 = 2 vi A/1 ? /32 vl is measured in Fl ( 4-33 ) * We have considered only transverse accelerations in a collision . If particles are allowed to collide in the direction of their common velocity , both time dilatation and length contraction enter into the measurements . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " deviant " acceleration of the moving particle is the fundamental , ( Lorentz ) relativistic space-time transformation . ( 4-31a )  | Since the relative velocity v of the two frames can also be measured in F1 , the entire right-hand side of ( 4-33 ) , which is the change in the velocity of the moving particle 2 , is measured in the single frame F1 . We now turn our attention to the simpler task of measuring the change in the velocity of particle 1 , which is essentially at rest in the laboratory system all the time . Before the collision particle 1 has the velocity v1 , and after the collision it has the velocity u1 , both measured in F1 . Since the collision is elastic , 1 ul v1 I both measured in F1 ; see Eq . ( 4-28 ) ; so dv1 , the change in the velocity of m1 , is Llv1 = 2v1 v1 measured in F1 ( 4-34 ) By ( 4-33 ) and ( 4-34 ) , the changes in the velocities of both particles 2 and 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do these instruments measure the inertial mass of particle 2 to be ? This raises the question of which basic operations are performed in measuring the unknown inertial mass of a particle ( see example 8 , Chap . 3 ) . Let particle A have the unknown inertial mass mA , and let particle B have the known inertial mass MB . To measure mA we allow A to collide with B , observe the change in the velocity of each particle , and , using the principle of the conservation of momentum for an isolated system mA dVA = mB dVB we calculate the unknown mass dvB MA =MB dva The collision test is a true test of inertial behavior , since both objects experience the same magnitude of force for the same time dt at the point of contact ( Newton 's third law ) . Their relative accelerations are defined to equal the inverse ratio of their masses ( Newton 's second law ) . The conservation of momentum and the method of measuring mass based upon it are firmly established principles if both particles have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 4-35 ) to define the meaning of " the inertial mass of a particle already moving with the velocity v. " Using particle 1 of known mass m1 , we strike the moving particle 2 of unknown mass m with a blow in the y direction . From the observation of the change in the y component of the velocity of each particle and the definition ( 4-35 ) , we calculate the value of m ; thus , m2 ? ml V2 ( for particle 2 ) where dv1 and JV2 are both measured in a single frame , F1 , and ml is also measured in F , . All the terms on the right side of ( 4-36 ) , therefore , are measured in F1 ; so we say that m. is measured , or observed , with instruments located in F1.  | Using ( 4-33 ) and ( 4-34 ) , which give AV , and dvi , respectively , for the elastic collision of Fig. 4-16 , m=m12v1 2 v1 ( 4-37 ) We have made a special point , however , of selecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same inertial mass as measured by instruments in any inertial frame for the case in which both are essentially at rest ( v c ) . The inertial mass of a particle measured when it is essentially at rest is called its proper mass or , more commonly , its rest mass . Thus we have chosen particle 2 and particle 1 with exactly the same rest mass m ? , m ? =m1=m2 If tested for its inertial reaction while moving , however , particle 2 will demonstrate an effective inertial mass m ( which we shall now designate by m ) which is larger than its rest mass m ? . This is apparent from ( 4-37 ) or from the same equation using the new notation m = m0 = v ( 4-38 ) 2 c This equation is the famous relativistic relationship between the effective inertial mass of a particle measured while it is moving with velocity'v and the rest mass of the same particle . In both cases , the basic test given to the particle is a collision with another particle of known mass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures its inertial mass . If a particle experiences a large acceleration under some standard test blow ( imparted impulse , or momentum ) it is said to have a small inertial mass . If it demonstrates only a small acceleration under the standard test , it is said to have a large inertial mass . In the test we have been discussing , the " kick , " or change in momentum , imparted to particle 2 in the y direction is measured by the laboratory instruments to be smaller than expected ( judging from the measurements made on particle 2 when it was at rest ) . We assign it a larger inertial mass , since we accept Eq . ( 4-35 ) with its three measured quantities on the right side as the operational definition of the inertial mass of a moving particle . There is no doubt about it . Moving particles are harder to accelerate than the same particles when nearly at rest . There is , however , an alternative and more exact way of thinking about the inertial properties of a moving particle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that belongs to the particle and never changes . When the particle is set in motion , however , and then exposed to some external force that causes a deflection from its original straight-line path , the laboratory instruments are forced to make nonproper measurements on the deflections . The laboratory instruments , therefore , measure dilatated ( nonproper ) time intervals , and ( in case the resulting displacement is parallel to v ) contracted ( nonproper ) space intervals . When the particle is not moving , these same instruments measure  | proper time intervals and proper space intervals . The increased mass , therefore , is a sort of artifact which results from the " distorted " measurements of space and time that are the heart of the theory of relativity . In the preceding analysis one can easily locate the exact point at which the fundamental , relativistic space-time transformation crept in ? Eq . ( 4-31a ) . There , in measuring the transverse ( y-directed ) velocity component of the moving particle with the laboratory instruments , we had to use a nonproper time interval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in space and terminated with an event at a different point in space . As we have seen , such intervals measured longer than the proper time interval between the same two space-time events . As a result of time dilatation , the laboratory instruments measured the transverse velocity component of the moving particle to be smaller than the same quantity measured with instruments traveling along with the moving particle . Rather , therefore , than think of the inertial mass as increasing because of its velocity , we could instead think of the particle as possessing a constant rest mass but note that , because of unavoidable effects on the measurements of space and time , the observed deflection of the particle produced by a given impact decreases as its velocity increases . There is great advantage , however , in thinking in terms of the relativistic increase in mass . First , it preserves the concept of the conservation of momentum in its familiar form ( 4-35 ) . Second , a single , simple relationship ( 4-38 ) connecting effective inertial mass m and rest mass mo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( longitudinal accelerations as well as transverse ones , for example ) in which the precise manner in which the distorted space-time measurements enter can be revealed only by careful analysis . This remarkable prediction of the theory of special relativity has been confirmed in a very direct manner . In 1902 , before Einstein had formulated the theory , Kaufmann , working with electric and magnetic deflections of " radium rays " ( now known as electrons , or n-rays ) , had already demon-strated that the inertial mass of these with velocity , compared with particles ( as disclosed by the difficulty with the theoretical curve . which they were deflected ) increased with the particle energy , or velocity. * Owing to experimental limitations , however , the exact form of the relationship of mass and velocity was not clearly discernable . Kaufmann was interested in making these measurements , sinde the theory of electricity and magnetism ? which is so intimately related to relativity ? had already predicted the same equation ( 4-38 ) for charged particles . Einstein showed that this relationship * Kaufmann , Physik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | between mass and velocity must he true for all objects , including charged particles , by deriving the equation from the broad principles of relativity . In 1909 , A. H. Bucherer and , in 1937 , C. T. Zahn , with much greater accuracy , showed that the experimentally observed relationship between mass and velocity for electrons was very close to ( 4-38 ) . Typical data are plotted in Fig. 4-18 . The collisions of neutral particles , such as neutrons , also demonstrate the same variation of inertial mass with velocity . The phenomenon has not yet been demonstrated in the laboratory for macroscopic masses , because of the difficulty of obtaining large velocities . 4.12 The Equivalence of Mass and Energy From the fact that inertial mass varies with velocity we can quickly show that the excess mass that appears as an increase in velocity is intimately related to the kinetic energy of the particle as measured in the rest system . The relativistic expression for the inertial mass The term on the extreme right is the familiar expression for the kinetic energy . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 4-40 ) Thus , for particles moving at low velocities , KE . Am c2 We now extend this definition to apply to particles at all velocities , that is , KE ? Amc2 KE ? moc2 ( ? 1 ) ( 4-41 ) v2/c2 We see , then , that we must regard the extra mass Am that appears to be added to the rest mass mo when the particle is given a velocity v as arising from the inertial mass possessed by the kinetic energy itself . The conversion factor is just c2.  | A more extended analysis of relativity implies that all forms of energy should possess inertial properties , with the same conversion factor c2. 4.13 Force , in Special Relativity It is found that the definition of force as the time rate of change of momentum continues to be useful in relativity . Let v be parallel to the x axis ; then F , and F2 are normal to v and will merely cause v to change direction , not magnitude . Thus , for F , and F2 , v2 = constant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = ma does not carry over into relativity , with a single expression for m . We shall have occasion later to consider forces perpendicular to v , which we shall designate as FL . We then use Fl = maL , where m is the ordinary relativistic mass , and a1 , the transverse acceleration , is normal to v. Using the above definition of force , we can compute the kinetic energy of a particle accelerated from rest in the +x direction : which justifies the definition ( 4-41 ) . The quantity mc2 is called the total energy , and m ? c2 is called the rest energy . The difference ( for the freely moving particle ) is called the kinetic energy . ( 4-42 )  | 4.14 Examples : The Application of the Theory of Relativity Example 1 . Measurement of Acceleration Normal to Direction of Relative Motion Two particles , each of rest mass m ? , are joined along the y axis by a compressed spring and are initially at rest in the laboratory , which is an inertial frame . When the constraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the laboratory to move a distance of 0.5 meter in 10-5 sec . The system is now placed on a cart which moves along the x axis with the velocity 0.9c , and instruments at rest with instruments observing it are respect to it . in the laboratory . figure the constraint is removed as the system passes the y axis of the laboratory coordinate frame . At a distance of 3,000 meters in the ? x direction , the two particles are detected . How far will they have been displaced along the y axis as a result of their acceleration ? The problem stated above is illustrated in Fig. 4-19 . On the left , in Fig. 4-18a , the initial experiment is displayed . y ' = 0.5 meter , and At ' = 10-5 sec . These are very nearly proper measurements , since , from Ay ' = 4a ' ( At ' ) 2 ( 4-43 ) we have a ' = 1010 m sec-2 , and , therefore v ' , the final y component of the velocity at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At ' ) = 105 m sec-1 This velocity is still very small compared with the velocity of light ; therefore , the value of a ' is essentially a proper measurement . We now set the system in motion on a cart , with a large velocity v = 0.9c , and , as Fig. 4-19b shows , the constraint is released as the system crosses the  | y axis at ( ) . At a distance of 3,000 meters , the two particles are detected , and are each found to have suffered a displacement of dy meters due to the acceleration . We wish to calculate this displacement as observed in the laboratory . Using the laboratory instruments , the velocity of the cart is measured as v  --  = 0.9 x 3 x 108 m sec-1 ; thus , the elapsed time measured in the laboratory from the initiation of the acceleration to the arrival of the particles at x = 3,000 meters is d t = 3,000 = 1.1 x 10-5 sec 0.9 x 3 x 108 The laboratory instruments measure the acceleration a1 of either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 2a1 ( dt ) 2 ( 4-44a ) We know , however , that both sets of instruments ( those moving with the cart and those in the laboratory ) read the same value for dy at any point , including the point chosen ( x = 3,000 meters ) ; thus , from ( 4-43 ) and ( 4-44a ) , 2a ' ( dt ' ) 2 2a1 ( 4t ) 2 ( 4-44b ) We also know from relativity that the common time interval is read differently by the clock riding on the cart ( very nearly proper time ) and the combination of distance and time measurements used to calculate the ( nonproper ) time interval in the laboratory frame . Thus , since This is true no matter what the source of the acceleration may be , and we shall have occasion to use it in discussing electricity . Since in our example , a ' = 1010 m sec-2 as measured by the instruments riding on the inertial frame of the cart , the acceleration as measured by the laboratory instruments is a1 = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m sec-2 In 3,000 meters of flight , requiring an elapsed time dt as measured in the laboratory , the displacement Ay normal to the direction of motion is  | At the moment the above observation was made in the laboratory ( at t 1.1 x 10-5 sec ) a clock moving with the system would record the transit of the mark at 3,000 meters . Since this clock started at the time the system crossed the y axis in the laboratory the time recorded on its face is = ( 1.1 x 10-5 ) 1/0.19 = 0.44 x 10-5 sec We see that , since a ' depends on t ' 2 , it is the apparent slowness of the moving clock that is the basic reason for the disagreement between the two different values of the acceleration as measured by the two different sets of instruments Eq . ( 4-45 ) . If the moving clock had been running " normally " , a displacement in the y direction of amount ay ' = x 1010 x ( 1.1 x 10-5 ) 2 = 0.62 meter would have occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In electricity , this phenomenon is known as relativistic focusing . It plays a very important role in the operation of high-energy accelerators . It is found that , in accordance with the theory of relativity , beams of either positive or negative charged particles ? which normally repel each other strongly owing to electrostatic forces , and would normally spread rapidly in directions transverse to their motion ? actually spread very little in the transverse directions . It is as if they were being prevented from spreading by a new attractive force that is present only when they are both moving rapidly in the laboratory . This force partially compensates for the normal repulsive force that would cause them to spread quickly apart if they were observed at rest . We shall see in the next chapter for the case of electricity that the effects we are here discussing may he ascribed to the magnetic field . The above derivation of the phenomenon is based , however , only on kinematical arguments , and must , therefore , be true whatever the cause of the mutual acceleration of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concept of relativistic mass increase can not alone explain the remarkable sluggishness of the masses when they are riding on the cart , since the inertial mass increases only as 1/1/1 ? v2/c2 , whereas the effect on the transverse acceleration a1 = force/mass is proportional to ( 1/1 ? v2/c2 ) 2 . It is not merely , therefore , that the mass of the particles is greater ; it must also be true that the net force exerted by the spring is smaller ( by the factor A/1 ? v2/c2 ) . Thus , not only mass but also force is affected by motion . Since it is always true that inertial mass increases with velocity , it is also always true that any transverse force decreases with velocity .  | Example 2 . Why do moving clocks run slow ? * The picture at the end of example 1 in which the mass was increasing and the spring was becoming weaker as the velocity of the observed system increased provides us with an alternative way of thinking about why a moving clock runs slow . Let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mo , together with the spring , compose a clock . If the spring is either stretched or compressed and if the two particles are released simultaneously , they will vibrate symmetrically about the central point of the spring . Each will execute simple harmonic motion about its own equilibrium point . The center of the spring will stand still . Let k ? be the spring constant of one half of the spring ( as measured with instruments at rest with respect to the spring ) . In an inertial frame in which the clock is at rest , both particles obey Newton 's second law m0 dt 2 ? koy ' or dt 2 = ? m y ' ( 4-46 ) which has the standard form of the differential equation for the harmonic oscillator , ( 2-15 ) . Each particle will execute a sinusoidal oscillation with a period given by ( 2-16 ) , T ' = 27r s 4jk ? ( 4-47 ) which forms the natural period of the clock . T ' is a proper time interval , since the object being observed is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to the recording instruments . We now wish to explain why the period of vibration of the clock measures longer if the clock is set into uniform motion with the velocity v in the x direction and then is observed with the laboratory instruments . We first note that the oscillating particles of the moving clock have more inertia , so that in calculating the period we should use mo/A/1 82 rather than mo . Since the above analysis of transverse acceleration demonstrates that the net force transverse to the direction of motion is weaker by the factor A/I ? R2 , we must use ko , /1 i R2 * The expression " moving clocks run slow " is a brief but not very precise statement of a concept . What it means is that moving clocks , if observed only with laboratory instruments , appear to run slow . Even more precisely , it means : Any two uniquely identified , point , space-time events that both occur at a moving clock ( such as two consecutive ticks , for example ) , if observed and exactly located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be found by those instruments to he spaced a larger number of seconds apart than the number recorded at the moving clock . It is operationally meaningless to state that a clock in a distant space ship with which we have no communication is running slow . The concept applies only when the particular events involved in the time measurement are actually located and observed in both inertial frames .  | rather than ko as the spring constant . The nonproper period T of the moving clock is , therefore , the fundamental relationship between proper and nonproper time interval . For this simple case where only transverse accelerations are involved , it is possible to say : Moving clocks appear to run more slowly than identical clocks at rest " because " the inertial mass of their moving parts is greater and their springs are weaker . In reality , this is no explanation . It is time dilatation itself that is the more fundamental concept . Time dilatation is a primary deduction from the basic postulates of relativity . The use of the concepts of larger inertial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the calculation come out right , that is , of making it agree with the basic transformation relationships ( 4-26 ) , one of which is the time-dilatation formula . Going back one more step , we still ask : Why does time dilatation occur ? Reference to Fig. 4-10 and the accompanying derivation will reveal that it is the remarkable characteristic of the light signals ( they always have the same measured velocity in any direction in any reference frame ) that is the immediate source of the difference between dt ' and zit . If , for example , we were to allow light to travel a little faster than c along the two paths labeled rs in Fig. 4-10 ( which would happen if light signals when once " launched upon a medium " were carried along by the medium just as a spreading ring of water waves is in fact carried along by a river ) , J t and Lit ' would have the same numerical value . As we have already pointed out at the end of Sec. 4.6 , a light signal echoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true clock . We conclude : Moving clocks " run slow " because the velocity of light measures the same in all inertial frames . Example 3 . The Relationship between Energy and Momentum Show that the relativistic relationship between the total energy E = mc2 and momentum p = my is  | Example 5 . The Observation of Time Dilatation Using a Satellite When observed at rest in the laboratory , a clock ticks at the rate of exactly one tick every second . It is placed upon a low-flying satellite that moves in a circular orbit , just above the earth 's surface . ( For simplicity , we assume that there is no atmosphere . ) Every time the clock ticks , it makes a permanent mark on the earth 's surface . The distance between consecutive marks is measured . What is the exact value of this distance ? Assume that the measured velocity of the stallite is exactly 8 x 103 meters per sec . Solution : In. this problem , the condition for the application of the theory of relativity is met , namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time and space and can be located exactly in both reference frames . We are given the precise value of the proper time between clock ticks , d t ' = 1 sec . The two events ? a pair of ticks ? are recorded on the earth , or laboratory , coordinate system , where they are separated in space and where they form , therefore , a nonproper interval dt which will have a larger numerical value than At ' .  | During the time interval At as measured in the laboratory , the satellite will have traveled the distance Thus , the spacing between marks is only slightly greater than the 8,000 meters that would have been measured had time dilatation not occurred . Such a tiny difference in distance ( 8 x 10-9 meter ) would , as a practical matter , be impossible to detect between two points separated by about 8,000 meters . Over a much longer distance , however , it might be detected . Let the satellite and clock run for 1 year ( 3.16 x 10 ' sec ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties of the satellite clock . The accrued displacement of each mark from its non-time-dilatated position would be 3.16 x 10 ' times greater ; that is , Total displacement after 1 year from the position expected if time dilatation did not occur ti8 x 103 x 1.06 x 3.16 x 10 ' = 268 meters This distance would be easily measurable if the satellite were really just above the earth 's surface . However , even at practical altitudes such as 300 miles , modern radar and radio-beacon devices should be able to determine the location of a satellite with respect to the earth to an accuracy of perhaps 10 or 20 meters . If necessary , the satellite could also run a longer time ( such as 10 years ) , which would relax the requirements on position-measurement accuracy . An earth clock , identical with that on the satellite , ( both must be stable to 1 part in 1011 or even better , if possible ) is needed to measure the velocity of the satellite to the required accuracy . ( The effect being observed has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clocks should be at least 10 to 100 times more accurate than 1 part in 109 . ) Since one needs to measure only the deviation from a calculated spatial position , one does not need to know to high accuracy the exact path length around the earth . One should note that , besides the velocity-dependent effect on timekeeping due to special relativity , there is also an expected altitude-dependent effect  | predicted by general relativity . At low altitudes , which we have of the moving clock , with the same result . The instruments moving with the clock measure the earth to have a velocity of exactly 8 x 103 meters per sec ( relative velocity always measures the same , referred to either coordinate frame ) . The problem is to measure the distance between any two marks that can be seen on the earth along the track of the satellite . The satellite sends out light signals and receives responses from the marked points , and from these responses the distance between the tracks is deduced . Since the satellite is making a mark once every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past at 8 x 103 meters per sec , the recorded readings on the satellite instruments will give the nonproper distance between marks Ax=vAt ' = 8 x 103 x 1 = 8,000 meters This distance measurement is nonproper , since the two points whose separation is being determined are moving with respect to the instruments that are making the measurement . Such distances always measure smaller than the proper distance between the two marks which the laboratory ( earth ) observers are measuring with fixed meter sticks ( moving rods measure short ) . Since as the proper distance between the marks , calculated from measurements made on the satellite . This result , which is based on the principle of length contraction , is in exact agreement with the proper distance between the same two marks calculated from ( 4-51 ) using the principle of time dilatation . In an experimental test , which has yet to be performed with macroscopic clocks , this calculated distance should agree with the actual distance measured on the ground using a measuring tape . It is apparent that time dilatation and length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure the satellite clock to be running slow , and the instruments on the satellite measure the spacing between the marks on the earth to be contracted . From either point of view , the same numerical value is obtained for the distance between the marks .  | Example 6 . The Calculation of Time Dilatation for Clocks Undergoing Acceleration : The Clock Paradox . The special theory of relativity applies exactly to kinematic measurements of point , space-time events in inertial frames and does not explicitly describe the consequences of acceleration . As a practical matter , however , acceleration is often unavoidable . For example , in Sec. 4.11 , on the dependence of inertial mass on velocity , the two colliding objects were both accelerated , permitting thereby a determination of the mass of the moving object . The results were found to be in agreement with experiment . Similarly , the expression " one of two clocks , identical when at rest , is given a velocity v " implies that the acceleration that is essential for placing the one clock in the new inertial frame ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) does not of itself cause any change in the clock . It is implied that only the new state of velocity affects the clock 's timekeeping properties . Again , this assumption agrees with experiments . Consider the case in which some of the high-velocity ar mesons in a beam are stopped ( that is , accelerated ) and allowed to decay at rest , while others in the same beam ( the original inertial frame ) are allowed to decay in flight . The experimental results agree with predictions based simply on the velocity-dependent relativistic effects . Thus , not only is acceleration unavoidable in special relativity ( it is needed to shift objects from one inertial frame to another ) , but there is evidence that its occurrence has no affect other than the basic one of placing thesobject in a new state of velocity . Acceleration can be accurately accounted for , providing all the motions involved are referred to some single inertial frame . We assume that the acceleration process per se does not alter the characteristics of the object being described . We shall analyze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In each case , clock 1 travels and experiences accelerations while clock 2 remains at rest in the inertial frame of the figure and does not experience any accelerations . In Fig. 4-20a , at t = 0 , clock 1 departs from 0 ( coincident with an emitted light pulse ) , travels to point A at v = 0.4c , is accelerated over a very short distance to the speed v = 0.8c , and then continues on , passing close to clock 2 ( which was started when the light pulse from 0 arrived ) . A photograph is taken of the two clock faces at the moment of coincidence . What will the readings be ? We apply the time-dilatation equation to each of the two parts of the path in Fig. 4-20a . In the laboratory , the transit time of clock 1 from 0 to A is 300/0.4c = 2.5 x 10-6 sec , and from A to B is 300/0.8c = 1.25 x 10-6 sec ; thus the total transit time from 0 to B is 3.75 x 10-6 sec . The three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals are each nonproper . Since clock 2 starts at t = 600/c = 2.0 x 10  --  6 sec , it will read 1.75 sec when clock 1 passes . Assuming that clock 1 reads zero as it departs from 0 , it will read 2.5 ! 10-6 /l 0.4 ' 2.29 10 6 sec when it passes A ( which is proper  | time ) . The trip from A to B will require an additional proper time , but in a different inertial frame , of amount 1.25 X. 10-6 A/1 ? 0.82 = 0.75 X 10-6 sec . Thus , when clock 1 passes B it will read 3.04 x 10-6 sec , whereas clock 2 ( which started late ) reads 1.75 X 10-6 sec ( the total transit time of clock 1 from 0 to B is 3.75 X 10-6 sec and is nonproper as measured in the laboratory , since the events marking it are separated in space ) . figure This treatment of clock 1 is an example of the description of an object in a succession of inertial frames . In Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps , and we again assume that the acceleration occurring at A does not produce any intrinsic change in the timekeeping properties of the traveling clock . As measured in the laboratory , the ( nonproper ) transit time for clock 1 to travel from 0 to A to B is 2 X ( 300/0.8c ) = 2.5 X 10-6 sec , but , since clock 2 starts late by 1.0 10-6 sec , clock 2 reads 1.5 X 10-6 sec at the moment clock 1 passes . Clock 1 measures the proper time 1.25 X 10-6 A/1 ? v2/c2 = 0.75 X 10-6 see in the trip from 0 to A , and it measures a second proper time interval of the same duration in its trip from A to B , but in a different inertial frame . The total proper time recorded by clock I at B is , thus , 2 0.75 10- " sec , which  | happens by an accident of geometry and speed to he just equal to the time recorded on clock 2 when the two clocks pass in coincidence . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Fig. 4-20c . The solution is already apparent from the two previous examples . Clock 1 records a proper time of 0.75 ; ( ( 10-6 sec in going from 0 to A , and , in a different inertial frame , it records an equal amount of proper time on the trip back to O , making 1.5 x 10-6 sec for the total proper time for the complete trip . Clock 2 , on the other hand , starts when clock 1 departs , and , since the transit time for clock 1 out to A and back is 2 x 300/0.8c = 2.5 @#@ 10-6 sec , clock 2 will read this time at the final coincidence at O. We see that the traveling clock runs slow compared with the rest clock . It is the traveling clock that shifts from one inertial frame to another ( it could , for example , shift among many inertial frames before it finally comes back to 0 , where clock 2 waits ) . Note that we have analyzed this problem with reference to a single inertial frame ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? but we should obtain the same result if we used any other single inertial frame . The " paradox " arises if we try to describe the events in Fig. 4-20c from a reference frame fixed to clock 1 . In such a frame ( which is not a single inertial frame , but rather a succession of such frames ) clock 2 appears to accelerate to the left , turn around at a point 300 meters distant , and then return to where clock 1 awaits it . Since clock 2 is now the traveling clock , it should run slow because of time dilatation ; hence the " paradox " . The source of the difficulty the unjustified assumption that a frame fixed to clock 2 is equivalent to a single inertial frame . If it is treated as a series of inertial frames with acceleration occurring between them , one obtains the original result , given above. * PROBLEM S : Relativity 4-1 .

In the experiment of Durbin , Loar , and Havens , referred to in the discussion following Eq .

Compare this theoretical result with the experimental observation described in a. 4-10 . A moving clock A traveling with the uniform velocity v in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there produces a very short pulse of light which radiates in all directions ( see Fig. 4-21 ) . The light pulse travels to mirror M , figure  | is reflected , overtakes the clock , and makes a permanent mark on the clock face indicating its arrival at the moving clock . The clock immediately sends a signal to the x axis ( an infinitesimal distance ) marking its location at the instant the light flash catches up to it .

The slave clocks operate as follows : The master clock ticks at moving clock the rate of 1010 per sec ( an atomic oscillator ) . and at each tick it sends a short pulse of light to the slave clocks , which then advance by 10-10 sec . To the accuracy of one tick , therefore , the two slave clocks exactly follow the master clock . They are set initially to zero and put in place , and the master clock is started . The two slave clocks start together and keep together . A fourth clock A , when at rest beside the master clock , is observed to run at an identical rate . It is then given a velocity v in the +x direction , as shown in the figure , passing in close proximity to each of the slave clocks in turn .

It carries two mirrors . M1 is on the front end and M2 is on the rear end .

It is difficult to imagine how waves can travel without having a medium in which to be propagated , but one can readily imagine a particle traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Michelson-Morley experiment as described in Fig. 4-6 , let the signals be composed of a shower of small particles , of very short duration , which leave 0 simultaneously in all directions , each having the same  | speed c with respect to the source . Since the particles are assumed to travel independently of the medium , their travel time from 0 to M , , and M2 would be uninfluenced by any postulated motion of the medium with respect to the earth . Show , however , with reference to Fig. 4-9 and 4-10 , that signals that had a constant velocity c with respect to their source would cause the effect of time dilatation to disappear ? a result which is in disagreement with experiment . IThe ballistic theory is also in disagreement with de Sitter 's analysis of eclipsing binary stars , which showed that , if as much as one five-hundredth of the velocity of the star were added to ( or subtracted from ) c , noticeable eccentricities in the stellar orbits would result.  | ELECTRICITY All physical theories are based fundamentally on experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results are collected . Only in retrospect , however , when the theory is in an advanced stage , is it possible fully to appreciate the significance of many of the experiments . Since our primary purpose is to demonstrate the unification of physics that is made possible by a small number of concepts , we shall not follow the historical order of discovery , but rather take for the experimental foundation of our study of electricity those experiments most clearly related to the basic concepts as we now understand them . No one can really appreciate science as an intellectual adventure and social phenomenon without a systematic study of the actual historical events themselves . Only by following some of the earlier scientists down a few erroneous paths and by seeing the puzzle as it is gradually solved at each stage can one gain a true appreciation of how new concepts in science actually are developed . The historical approach has some disadvantages , however . It is frequently confusing , and , in addition , it often obscures the conceptual unity that later knowledge provides . In any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key experiments in electricity without much regard for their position in the historical development of the subject . We shall be particularly concerned with the fact that the principal features of dynamic electricity can be deduced by simple arguments from special relativity . To the greatest possible extent , we shall treat the electric and magnetic effects observed for moving charges as exemplifying the consequences of relativity . It happens , in electricity , that relativistic phenomena are exposed to easy observation even at velocities very small compared with the velocity of light . Indeed , the most interesting aspects of electricity and magnetism are essentially relativistic effects , and their general nature ? although not necessarily all their detailed features  --  can be predicted with the aid of relativity , starting from the primary electric force observed between charges at rest .  | 5.1 The Key Phenomena of Electrostatics The first basic feature of electricity is that it has two distinctive forms , positive and negative . Pith balls touched to a hard rubber rod that has been rubbed on cat 's fur pick up a charge from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sign of the electric charge on the rubber rod is arbitrarily called negative . If other pith balls are touched to the fur , they repel each other , but they have a mutual attraction with the pith ball that has been touched to the rod . The sign of the charge on the fur is called positive . The law of force readily formulated on the basis of these observations states : Like charges repel , and unlike charges attract . Because opposite signs of charge exist , it is possible in many cases to cancel out the direct electrostatic force demonstrated by the pith balls and to leave exposed to easy observation the relativistic phenomena associated with velocity and acceleration . Of the basic forces in nature ? gravitational , electric , and nuclear ? only the electric exhibits the phenomenon of the two opposite signs of charge , and it is only with respect to electrical phenomena , therefore , that relativistic effects can be easily observed even at small velocities . The second basic feature of electricity is the experimentally observed law of force between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ql and q2 are the quantities of charge ( to be defined below ) on the two ( small ) objects between which the force is being measured , r is the distance in meters between the centers of the charges , and the constant 1/4 - eo is an arbitrary constant adjusted to suit the units used elsewhere in the formula . If q is a negative electric charge , it is given a negative algebraic sign in ( 5-1 ) . If q is a positive charge , it is given a positive sign . Fe is the force in newtons between the two charges . A positive sign for Fe indicates an attractive force . Thus , the law that like charges repel and unlike charges attract is satisfied automatically by ( 5-1 ) . Although distance and force are familiar quantities , electric charge is a completely new , fundamental entity , and it requires completely new units . The unit of charge is defined by means of Coulomb 's law , as follows : When two point charges of equal magnitude , separated by a distance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x 109 newtons , each of the charges is said to have a magnitude of one coulomb ( coul ) . The reason for the particular value ( 9 109 nt-m2 per coul2 ) and the unusual form ( 1/4iw0 ) used for the constant in Eq . ( 5-1 ) is rooted in historical aspects of the subject that we do not have space here to discuss . The definition of the unit size of any new quantity is basically arbitrary . It is desirable , of course , that the unit chosen he widely used ? as the coulomb is . Ilow can one be sure that the two charges being tested have the same magnitude ? One uses a third charge , whose magnitude need not be known .  | Charges 1 and 2 , which are being compared , arc each placed , in turn , at a given distance from charge 3 and held in place with a spring balance or other forcemeasuring device . Charge is added to or taken from either I or 2 until the instrument measures the same magnitude of force when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge 3 . Since 1 newton is 0.225 lb of force , it is clear that no one has ever assembled two 1-coul point charges and arranged them 1 meter apart ( 9 x 109 nt 106 tons ! ) . Actual pith balls , or small metal spheres used in typical electrostatic experiments ( that is , experiments directly involving Coulomb 's law ) , have charges of the order of 10-6 coul . Placed 0.1 meter apart , two equal charges of this magnitude will experience a mutual force of which is easily measured . The definition of negative and positive charge is basically arbitrary . It is necessary only that the test be reliable . By the rubber-rod-and-cat's-fur test , which is reliable though not very convenient , we find that electrons ( see below ) are negative . The response of electrons to some unknown charge is often the simplest test for the sign of the unknown charge , since electrons are easily produced , uniquely identified , and readily detected . ? Using the new units , Coulomb 's law becomes Fe ( newtons ) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ q2 ( coulombs ) ( 52 ) r2 ( m ) The third basic feature of electricity is that electric charge is discontinuous , or quantized . In 1913 , Robert Millikan used microscopic droplets of oil as charged pith balls in between two large electric charges ( the two horizontal charged plates of Fig. 5-1 ) . Millikan balanced the electrostatic force Fe against the gravitational force mg on the oil droplet . Viewed with a microscope , the state of equilibrium of the droplet g Fp oil drop could be determined so accurately mg small positive charge that charges as small as 10-21 coul + + + + + + + + + + could be measured . Millikan found P , that , whether the electric charge on Fic. 5-1 The Millikan oil-drop the drop was positive or negative , he experiment . never observed a quantity less than 1.60 x 10-19 coul and that all larger quantities of charge were integral multiples of this amount . The reason why electric charge is quantified in this manner and the reason for the particular magnitude of the unit charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed on individual droplets in Millikan 's historic experiment . This  | particular quantized charge has yet to be meaningfully related to , that is , derived from , any other physical constant or constants . The simple fact , the quantization of electric charge ? so familiar it almost seems to be no mystery , but nonetheless completely unexplained ? illustrates vividly how far we still are from a really complete theory of the physical world . Millikan 's measurement provides us with a natural unit of charge , e = 1.6 x 10  --  19 coul , called the electronic charge . For ordinary electrons , e is negative , but it is positive for many particles  --  the proton ( the nucleus of the hydrogen atom ) , for example . The fourth basic feature of electricity is its intimate relationship with the structure of matter . Each of the atoms of the chemical elements that compose matter as we know it consists of a central massive nucleus containing an integral number of positive electronic charges and a surrounding " cloud " of electrons having the same number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( normal ) atom as a whole , therefore , is electrically neutral . Under many conditions , however , the charges of matter can be partially separated . For example , when the fur rubs on the rubber rod , electrons become detached from the atoms of the fur and , for some reason , stick to the atoms of the rubber rod . The work needed to pull some of the more loosely bound electrons from the atoms composing the fur ( against the normal attractive force between the negative electrons and their central positive nucleus ) comes from the experimenter . The process of electrostatic charging by friction is actually very complicated and not well understood . There are other ways more subject to quantitative analysis by which one can pull electrons or even whole positive ions ( an ion is an atom with one or more electrons missing ) away from a physical object . One simple way ( discovered experimentally by Edison ) is to heat up a piece of metal in a vacuum in which a positively charged object is near the hot metal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boil off " the metallic surface . This process is called thermionic emission . The electrons fly through the vacuum , since they are attracted by the positive charge . ( Electrons do not move freely through air or other gas , because of constant collisions with the gas atoms . ) After traversing the vacuum , the electrons come to rest on the positively charged object ( the anode ) , ultimately reducing its net charge to zero unless they are conducted away to another region where there is still more positive charge . In our discussion of electricity , we shall often employ the concept of beams of electrons produced by thermionic emission . The ability of some materials , mainly metals , to permit the ( nearly ) free flow of electrons through their structures is of great practical importance . Only since the advent of quantum mechanics , however , has a satisfactory theory of this phenomenon been found , although the main phenomenological features have been known for a long time . If at some instant there happens to be even a very tiny excess positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called free electrons present everywhere inside the metal flow rapidly toward this region which is deficient  | of negative charge . Left alone , the copper wire will soon have no region of excess positive charge , since the free , or conduction , electrons so distribute themselves that there is no net attractive force toward any region of the wire . If the wire is connected , however , between two very large objects ( one positive and one negative ) , the electrons in the wire will continue to flow . For every electron taken from the negative object , one electron is deposited on the positive object ; so the wire itself is essentially uncharged at all times . This process continues until the charge on the two objects has readjusted in such a way that there is , in the end , no net force acting on any of the electrons . At this stage the flow of charge ceases . In typical metals , the atoms are spaced in regular arrays , with their centers about 2 x 10-10 meter apart . There is usually one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , a metal wire 1 meter in length and 10-6 sq meter in cross section ( about 1 mm in diameter ) contains about 10-6/ ( 2 x 10-10 ) 3 ? 1023 atoms and about the same number of free electrons . Since each electron carries a charge of 1.6 x 10-19 coul , we see that a 1-meter length of rather thin wire contains on the order of 104 coul of charge , all of which is free to move . The enormous quantity of free charge contained within even small conducting objects is of great practical importance . Besides conductors , which have many electrons that are completely free to move , there are semi-conductors , in which a relatively small number of electrons are partially free , and finally insulators , in which there are no free electrons at least under normal conditions . In gases and in liquids , both positive and negative charges can move with considerable freedom . In a vacuum , electrons , positive ions , or negative ions ( atoms with an excess electron ) can be moved about in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity , the charges observed to move in the laboratory may have either sign . Because of its electrical nature , matter reacts to the presence of electric charge in many different ways . We shall be principally concerned , however , only with the behavior of conductors . If all we knew about electricity were what we have discussed above ? generally designated by the term electrostatics ? the subject would be rather drab . The really interesting part of the subject concerns the behavior of electric charges when they are moving in the laboratory with a velocity v or accelerating in the laboratory with an acceleration a . Now , when we start measuring the behavior of moving objects with instruments at rest , we know that we must take special relativity into account at every step . We should not be surprised , therefore , to find that the fundamental concept that all inertial frames are equivalent plays a role in the determination of the nature of the behavior of moving charges , since charges too are moving objects . The really surprising thing about the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it causes some observable effects , but that it plays so dominant a role . One does not have to go ( as one must with ordinary mechanical motions ) to extremely high velocities such as v 0. l c to observe a z percent effect superimposed upon  | the ordinary low-velocity , phenomena. * In electricity , because there are two opposite signs of charge , the fundamental , powerful , Coulomb force can be almost entirely canceled , leaving the relativistic effects completely exposed , even at low velocities and small accelerations . Many of the phenomena of dynamic electricity were discovered before the principle of relativity was formulated . Indeed , they contributed strongly to its discovery . Maxwell 's theory , which related these diverse electrodynamic effects , is the first theory ever formed that agreed with relativity , and it preceded Einstein by 30 years or more . The reason is simple : Laboratory observations neatly exposed many of the relativistic effects so that they had to be included in the theory . The laboratory observations of dynamic electricity were done by many careful observers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Joseph Henry . These experimenters used great ingenuity and care , and no significant feature observable by the techniques then existing was missed . Using these data and adding some ideas of his own , Maxwell formulated a theory of electricity and magnetism . Unlike classical mechanics , which is incorrect at high velocities , the classical theory of electricity works accurately at all velocities , high and low . 5.2 The Electric Field and Potential Difference How do two objects influence each other through empty space ? One way of thinking about the process is to suppose that charge 1 produces a special state , or " quality , " in space at some distant point P , called the electric field . Charge 2 is now placed at P , and its behavior is used to measure the presence of the electric field . The test charge , 2 , acts as if it were experiencing a force . This is evidenced in the laboratory either by its acceleration or by the fixed deflection of a spring balance constraining it ( unless we also constrain charge 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position when charge 2 is brought near , since , by Coulomb 's law , there is an observed mutual force between the two charges ) . If we define the electric field Ee as an ordinary vector , we have figure  | of the distance in meters from q to the field point I ' , and t ' is the unit vector defined by f = r/r. always has its origin at the source charge q and always points toward the field point P. Thus , E , , points outward from positive charges and inward toward negative charges . Figure 5-2 shows the field at one point P caused by a single positive charge q located at the origin . If there are two charges present , as in Fig. 5-3 ( where , for convenience , we temporarily drop the subscript e from Ee ) , the electric field at P is found figure  | positive unit charge at rest placed at the point 1 ' . For the electrostatic field , this force is called the Coulomb force Fe ( 5-2 ) , and so ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ q is the magnitude in coulombs of the test charge , and Fe is the force in newtons acting on the test charge . We shall see below that , in addition to Fe , the dynamic motion of the source charge also produces forces on a test charge at rest . Thus , electric fields arise by virtue of both the position and the motion of the source charge . The electric field is a great aid to computation , since , in many cases , one can derive simple formulas that permit the calculation of the field for several geometric arrangements of electric charge commonly encountered in practice . It is also a conceptual aid , since it helps us visualize the fact that the space at every point near a charge has distinctive properties . Nevertheless , however useful the electric field may be , we can not observe it directly , and it must properly be regarded as a mental construct of a higher level of abstraction than , for example , the pith ball , which , when placed at point P and released , leaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a rest position , is the basis for the operational definition of the electric field . There is one more very useful concept to be defined : electric potential difference . In Fig. 5-4 , the charge q is located at the origin and is surrounded in every direction by an electric field . We wish to calculate the work required from an external source of energy to move a positive test charge of 1 cowl from one point to another in the electric field of q , from A to B , for example . The unit test charge is initially at A and experiences a force of Fe nt directed radially away from q . It is held in equilibrium by an equal and opposite , externally applied force Fext = ? Fe . There are many possible paths from A to B , but we choose to move initially along an arc of radius rA to point C , which is directly out from B on a radial line . The motion of the test charge is assumed to be frictionless and also very slow , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in position . Along the arc from A to C , the displacement dr of the point of application of Fext is always exactly normal to the direction  | of the force , so the force does no work . From C in to the point I3 , however , the point of application of the external force is moving in the direction of the force , so the external force is now doing work on the test charge . The force increases in magnitude , of course , as the test charge approaches 0 , since the test charge must be held in equilibrium at all times . All the work done by the external force occurs in this part of the path . Since Fext = ? Ee = ? 4rrgor2 the work done on the unit charge by an external force in moving it from the initial point A to the final point B is If rA #@# rB , as in Fig. 5-4 , then the work done by the external force is positive . It can easily be shown that another path , such as ADEFB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is done in traveling along any arc centered at q , so all the work is done on the radial part of the displacement , giving the same total work as that calculated above . Any arbitrary path can be approximated by a series of infinitesimally small steps , and , since only the radial parts involve work , the result ( 5-7 ) is independent of the path taken from A to B. The only factors of importance are the initial and final radial distances of the test charge from q , the charge causing the electric field . We define the electric potential difference VB ? VA between the final point of the path B and the initial point A in an electric field as the work ( in joules ) performed by an external force ( at all times just sufficient to balance the electric force ) in moving a unit positive charge (  - -  1 coul ) from the initial point A to the final point B. If , as in Fig. 5-4 , there is only one source charge present , then , from ( 5-7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joule per coulomb , has been given a special name , the volt . Potential difference is a scalar quantity , and , when many charges are present , as is often the case , the total potential difference between any two spatial points is the algebraic sum of the potential differences between those two points , calculated for each charge separately . For the total electric field , by contrast , one must add the fields from the individual charges vectorially . As a simple example of the calculation of potential difference , we consider 1I.PCTRI ( ' FFPI.I ) .4 Nn POTENTl.4I. n It'Pl.RENCb : I ( iI  | the two charges q1 and q2 of Fig. 5-5 . In moving the unit positive test charge from A to B ( considering only q , ) , the external force performs the work volts , or joules coul- ' On the other hand , in moving from A to B ( considering only q2 ) , the external force performs the work figure When the work done by an external force on a system is found to be negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the external environment . In Fig. 5-5 , from the start of its path to the end , the positive test charge makes a net radial motion toward the negative charge q2 . All this time , q2 is pulling on the test charge , and the external force needed to balance the field is holding back . Thus , in the case of q2 , the system does work on the source of the external force . The total potential difference between A and B is VB ? VA = 11.5 x 103 ? 2.2 x 103 = 9.3 x 103 volts VB is said to have a higher potential than A , since it requires a net positive amount of external work to cause the unit positive test charge to move from /1 to B along any path . In practice , of course , potential difference is measured with very small test charges . The ratio of work done ( in joules ) to test charge ( in coulombs ) is the potential difference . If an electric potential difference exists between two points , there must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them , since it is the force from the electric field that , in opposing the motion of the unit test charge , makes necessary the external work that defines the potential difference .  | From the equation for potential difference ( 5-8 ) it is apparent that , if the initial point A is located at a very great distance ( rat 00 ) , then the potential difference becomes simply which depends only upon the distance rB of the final point from the source charge q . The quantity is called the potential at a point P located r meters from a charge q . V is actually the potential difference between one point at distance r from q and a second point at infinity . Accordingly , one defines the potential at infinity as zero . Under static conditions , a conducting object can not have a potential difference between any two points on its surface or in its interior . If any regions having potential difference did exist , they would quickly be neutralized by the free charge , which always distributes itself so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the surface and to cancel completely any interior electric field . Thus , under static conditions , all points on a conductor are at a constant potential . In summary , the total electric field at a point located rl from qi and r2 from q2 is ( 5-10 ) vector sum The potential at the same point is V 4rE ( qi +q ) ( 5-11 ) 0 1 r2. algebraic sum 5.3 Electric Current Physics is an experimental science , and careful , repeatable observations are both the logical starting point and the last court of appeal in every area of inquiry . Therefore , we shall start our description of the behavior of electric charges in motion by summarizing the key experimental observations . Unfortunately , this is no simple task , since , in a detailed sense at least , the interactions of moving charges are surprisingly complicated . To bring the description of the experiments into a small compass , we shall employ highly idealized gedanken experiments . In some cases , however , we shall briefly describe realistic experimental operations that correspond closely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows . We specify the geometrical configuration and the state of motion of one set of charges , called the source ( 5-9 ) = 1 q1 q2 E ' e 4 ' 7E0 0 ' 1 rl + r2 r21  | charges . Then , at some point P , called the field point , we place a very small charge , the test charge , whose behavior we observe . From the behavior of the test charge we infer the nature of the fields that the source charges produce at P. The test charge is conceived as being very small ? such as the charged oil drop in Millikan 's experiment ? so that it produces a negligible influence on the source charges . Thus , the set of moving source charges produces a set of fields at P , and the small test charge at P ( which also can be caused to move , as necessary ) measures these fields . For the sake of completeness , we shall describe experiments of two different basic types . In one , the source charges are moving in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the source charges are isolated in space . Both types of source-charge motion are found to generate the full set of electrodynamic fields . We shall first consider the motion of charges along a long , thin conductor , such as a metal wire . As a whole , a wire is electrically neutral , but when it is connected between two objects that have opposite electrical charge , the free electrons begin to flow along the wire , transferring the excess negative charge from the negatively charged object ( which has an excess of negative charge ) and depositing it on the positively charged object ( which has a deficiency of negative charge ) . In this process , however , the wire does not change significantly its own state of electrical neutrality . Also , no matter what the geometrical form of the wire may be , once a steady flow has been established , the flow of charge in each part is the same . The steady flow of charge is maintained against the frictional losses experienced by the moving charges by means of a small electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wire in a manner which follows from the laws of electrostatics and the nature of conductors and which has nothing directly to do with electrodynamics . The acceleration of the charges in the wire ( which occurs for a short interval just after the connection to the charged objects is formed ) does involve electrodynamic effects , since the electrons in their motion influence each other , but it is not necessary to analyze this aspect in detail . We shall merely assume that we can measure the state of motion of the charges and that , at any time t , the charges in all parts of the conducting loop have essentially the same speed v and , therefore , the same magnitude of acceleration a , the same da/dt , etc . That is , we assume that the charges move in unison . A flow of charges in a wire , through a vacuum , or through any other medium , form an electric current . We shall be concerned only with thin wires or with thin beams of particles moving in a vacuum . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meter whose flow constitutes the current . I.et the average velocity of the charged particles be v meters per sec. * Thus , * The conduction electrons have randomly directed velocities which are much larger than the drift velocity , just as the gas molecules in the wind have high randomly directed velocities which are much larger than the speed of the wind . The average of the random velocities , however , is zero .  | in 1 sec , nov particles will pass a given point . If each particle carries an electric charge of q coul , then nogv cowl will be carried past a given point each second . This quantity is called the electric current i . Thus , i = nogv ( 5-12 ) measured in coulombs per second ( coul sec-1 ) , or amperes ( amp ) . Also , we define the linear charge density po measured in coulombs per meter ( coul m-1 ) . Since we assume that no and q are constants , we have where a is the acceleration of the charges . There is a long-standing convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electric current has the direction given by the velocity of the positive charges . Thus , for example , positive ions moving in the +x direction form an electric qurrent flowing in the +x direction . A completely equivalent current , however , can be formed by negative charges ( such as negative ions or electrons ) moving in the ? x direction ( negative velocity ) . Although it is true that electrons are the charged particles that actually move inside metallic conductors , we shall , nonetheless , do most of our analysis by ascribing the motion to positive charges . This is done only for reasons of simplicity . It does not affect the conclusions in any way , since it turns out that all the dynamic effects produced by positive charges moving in one direction are identical with those produced by negative electric charges moving in the opposite direction . In addition , there are many cases in which positive charges actually do form the electric current ? a positive ion beam in a vacuum , positive ions drifting through a gas or a liquid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reasons of simplicity , we shall usually assume that the test charge is positive . It is found that all electric forces exactly reverse in direction if the sign of the test charge is reversed , so it is sufficient to describe the behavior of only one type of charge . Let us estimate the average velocity v of the conduction electrons for a typical case . Consider a wire with a diameter of 10-3 meter . As we have noted in Sec. 5.1 , a 1-meter length of such a wire contains about 1023 atoms ; so , if we assume ( in accordance with other evidence ) , that there is one conduction electron per atom , we have no = 1023 charges per meter , with each charge q 1.6 X 10-19 coul . Let the electric current be i = 102 coul per sec , or 102 amp . Then , by ( 5-12 ) , we have v = 6 x 10-3 meter per sec . A steady current this large ( 100 amp ) would cause serious heating in a copper wire of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one seldom encounters conduction electron velocities much in excess of 10 2 meter per sec , and they can range below this value by many orders of magnitude . 5.4 The Experimental Observation of the Four Fields of Dynamic Electricity We are now ready to describe three idealized experiments with the source charges flowing in closed loops , as shown in Fig. 5-6 . In each case , we assume a uniform charge density everywhere in the loop . The loops are made of thin conducting wires and contain an equal number of negative charges , all of which are at rest . The field point P is located on the right , and each loop is so formed figure  | that two of its four sides point toward 1 ' and two are essentially normal to the direction to P. For our purposes the exact shape of the loop is not particularly important , since it can be shown that , when P is a distance of several loop diameters away , the fields at P are very insensitive to the exact form of the loop . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplify some calculations that will be made later . The three different parts of Fig. 5-6 differ primarily in the specified motion of the source charges flowing in the loops . In part a , the charges have uniform velocity ( or , more accurately , uniform speed ) ; in part b , uniform acceleration ; and , in part c , uniform da/dt . We shall see that each experiment will reveal a new aspect of the electrodynamic fields . In order to cause the steady current in Fig. 5-6a , we may imagine a small battery connected in the loop ( the battery is in series with the wire ) . For example , one could use a small battery like that used in a flashlight and a loop of wire about 1 meter long with one end connected to each terminal . The charge , which is continually supplied at the terminals of the battery , flows continuously through the wire . A device conceptually simpler than a chemical battery is a small capacitor , made of two closely spaced conducting plates that have equal and opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small fraction of the total stored charge of the capacitor has been transferred through the wire , the potential difference between the terminals will remain essentially constant , and the charged capacitor will act like a battery . After the transient effects associated with the starting of the current have died away , the current will be ( essentially ) constant , and , therefore , by ( 5-12 ) , the velocity of the charges along the wire will also be constant . In order to get the time-varying currents shown in Fig. 5-6b and c , we shall assume that each loop contains a small battery whose potential difference increases with time in such a manner that the currents have the magnitudes kt and kt2 , respectively , where k is a constant . Thus , by ( 5-14 ) and ( 5-15 ) , one loop contains charges for which a = k/po , and the other , charges for which da/dt = kip , . Experiment 1 . The Source Charges Have Constant Velocity In Fig. 5-6a , we first suppose that the test charge q2 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velocity v2 = 0 . We then observe that , if q2 is released from all constraints so that it is completely free to move in any direction , it does not accelerate ; that is , it experiences no net force by virtue of the uniformly moving source charges . ( As we have noted , the loop is neutral ; so the electrostatic force arising from the large number of positive source charges ql is exactly balanced by an opposite force due to the equal number of negative charges . ) We conclude that either the uniformly moving charges in the closed loop do not produce any electric field by virtue of their velocity or that the uniform velocity does produce an electric field , but the vector sum of all the contributions from each region of the loop happen to add up to zero at any field point P. As we shall see later , the second alternative is correct . We say that no net electric field exists at P , since  | the nonzero test charge q2 , which is at rest at I ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . This means , by definition , that E = 0 . We now give the test charge q2 a velocity v2 , arbitrarily choosing the y direction . We then observe a fundamentally new effect of great importance : the moving test charge q2 accelerates in the ? x direction . This indicates the presence of new force F ? . If we follow the motion of q2 for a short time , we note that the acceleration , which is revealed by the observation of dv over a time interval At , does not continue in its initial direction ( the ? x direction ) but always remains exactly normal to the instantaneous velocity v2 of q2 . Thus , in the example in Fig. 5-6a , as v2 is rotated in the counterclockwise sense , F ? , also turns , exactly the same amount , remaining exactly normal to v2 . Rarely in the macroscopic world do we observe a force with these remarkable properties . * It suddenly jumps into existence , so to speak , the instant the test charge q2 is given a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimentally to be proportional both to q2 and to v2 . Furthermore , it is proportional to vl , the speed of the source charges , and also to their number N. At large distances r from the loop , its magnitude is found to be proportional to 1/r3 . For the moment , we shall not attempt to give a complete description of this unusual force , which is called the magnetic force , but shall merely note that the expression summarizes most of its unique features . Fm is proportional both to q2 ( the test charge ) and to Nql ( the total source charge ) , but it is not unique in these respects , since the other dynamic forces soon to be discussed are also proportional to both these quantities . The Magnetic Induction Field B ? What is the source of Fm ? The fact that it appears instantly when the test charge is given a velocity suggests that the space at the field point P has some special property that arises from the uniformly flowing charges in the loop . ( We assume that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vi for a time longer that r/c , the minimum signal-transmission time . ) It has been found that , if one assumes that at P there exists a new type of field quantity B , , , , the magnetic induction field , which is proportional to vl ( by a vector rule to be discussed in more detail in Sec. 5.5 ) and which , for the case in Fig. 5-6a , points in to the page , then the observed force Fm , is found to be given by Fm = g2 ( v2 x Bv ) where B ? is measured in newton-seconds per coulomb per meter ( nt-sec soul m-1 ) . ' The Coriolis force , which arises when one seeks to describe the motion of an object in a rotating coordinate system , also has the property of being normal to the observed velocity of the object .  | Thus , B ? arises from the velocity of the source charges and can he sensed only if a velocity is given to the test charge ; then it reveals itself as a unique perpendicular-to-v @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units nt-sec per coul per meter , since F ? L is measured in newtons . We now ask : What happens if the test charge is accelerated ? Does a new type of electrical force appear ? Experimentally , the answer is no. * It is found that only the velocity of the test charge produces a new electrical force , and then only when a magnetic field is present . Thus , a test charge with a velocity v is essential for the direct observation of a magnetic field . The unique perpendicular-to-v force on the test charge may be regarded as the operational definition of a magnetic field . Surprising as the nature of the magnetic force may be , there is another force ? the reaction force due to inertia that also has a very special dependence upon the state of motion of the test object . Let an isolated object of mass m move with a constant velocity in an inertial frame . It appears to sense no force . Now accelerate the object by pushing on it with a rod . The rod instantly experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object . It is as if the reaction force sprang into existence only when the object was accelerated . When v becomes constant once again , the reaction force instantly disappears.t The magnetic force F , , , is employed in two important practical devices : electric motors and electric generators . To see in principle how the motoo works , imagine a long rod , parallel to the y axis and passing through P ( see Fig. 5-6a ) . By means of sliding contacts ( which will permit the rod to slide parallel to its length along the x direction ) , connect a battery to the rod . Thus , many charges , such as q2 in the figure , will move in the +y direction . Each of the charges qa will be pulled to the left by its own magnetic force F , , , . Thus , the rod itself will be pulled to the left . Connect a weight to the rod by means of a pulley or some other device , so that the leftward motion of the rod will lift the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do work . To see in principle how the electric generator works . simply take the rod * Under very rapid , time-varying accelerations a charge experiences a " radiation reaction force . " This is because the charge is emitting energy in the form of electromagnetic waves , and this energy must come from the agent causing the acceleration . For macroscopic experiments , and even for charges moving at atomic frequencies , this force is generally very small compared with the ordinary reaction force arising from the inertia of the charged particle . t In the latter part of the nineteenth century , Ernst Mach speculated that the distant matter of the universe caused some sort of local field ( due basically to gravitational effects ) that could not be sensed by matter at rest or with uniform velocity , but was instantly sensed by an accelerating object . Thus inertial mass was thought to arise from a gravitational interaction with distant matter and should be expected to be proportional to gravitational mass , in accordance with observation . This theory has remained a speculation , principally because ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way to control significantly the sources of this field . Any mass that can he manipulated experimentally produces an extremely small direct gravitational force on any test object , and any dynamic effects of this gravitational force are much too small to he observed .  | ( as described in the above paragraph ) and , by means of ' some external mechanical agent , cause it to move to the left ( the . v direction ) with some velocity v2 . Since Br points into the page , the force F , , , acting on each positive charge q2 in the rod will he directed in the ? y direction . If a wire is connected to the ends of the rod ( again by means of sliding contacts , so that the wire may be at rest in the laboratory while the rod moves ) , the charges q2 in the rod will be forced to flow along the rod and , therefore , through the wire , as long as the rod is kept in motion , that is , as long as F. acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical force is used to cause electric charges to flow around a closed path , or circuit , just as if they came from a battery . The Lorentz Force Equation Careful study has shown that there are just two types of field that can be sensed by a test charge : ( 1 ) the electric field E , which is sensed by a test charge both when it is at rest and when it has a velocity v , and ( 2 ) the magnetic field B , which is sensed by a test charge only when it has a velocity v. Thus , in general , the total force on the test charge q is found to be F = qE - ( v x B ) ( newtons ) ( 5-17 ) We shall employ this equation , known as the Lorentz force equation , to define both the electric and the magnetic fields , which , as we shall see , arise from different states of motion of the source charges . Thus , a charge at rest produces an electric field , which we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conducting loop with a uniform velocity produce a magnetic field , which we have called B2 , the first of the four dynamic fields of electricity . It is immediately apparent from the principle of relativity that E and B are closely related and that they depend upon the reference frame in which they are measured . Consider the simple case of Fig. 5-6a , where , in the laboratory reference frame , E = 0 , but B ? is nonzero and is directed into the page . Over a short interval Lit , q2 will be displaced in the ? x direction a small distance dx == 2(Fm/m) 1 t2 ( where m is the mass of q2 ) and a large distance v2 Lit in the l y direction . Let these same displacements now be described from the standpoint of an inertial frame F moving in the +y direction with the velocity v2 . In this frame q2 is initially at rest . In the same time interval dt ( we assume v2 ' c , so that time dilatation is negligible in frame F ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ? x direction . Since charge q2 , which is at rest with respect to frame F , experiences a force in the ? x direction , we conclude that , as observed from reference frame F , ? n e.c , , , ric field exists and is pointing in the x direction . Thus , in the laboratory frame , an electric field does not exist at P , but , in frame F , which is moving in the +y direction with the velocity v2 , an electric field does exist . But , since all inertial frames are equivalent , either frame is as satisfactory as the other for describing any physical operation , and we are forced to conclude that what is observed as an electric or a magnetic field depends upon the state of the observing instruments .  | It is significant that , with respect to frame F of the above paragraph , the loop is moving in the ? y direction ( it has the velocity - v2 ) . ' 1'lrus , we have the result ( also observed by Faraday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as well as a magnetic field , which one can readily show also exists in frame F ) . This suggests that , under the right conditions , an electric field may be observed which arises from the velocity of the source charges . When the loop is stationary , the electric field at P ( which is the sum of the contributions from all the parts of the loop ) is zero , but , when the loop is moving , the cancellation is no longer exact , and a net electric field appears . Electrons and many other elementary particles behave as if the electric charge of which they are composed were spinning about an internal axis , since they produce magnetic fields , which , by every test , are identical with the magnetic fields of the complete elementary charge , moving as a unit . In magnetic materials , for example , many electron-spin axes are aligned , giving an easily observable external magnetic field , but this field is the same as that produced by a coil of wire carrying a current . We shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a consequence of the motion of electric charges , in accordance with the principle of relativity . Accordingly , we entitle this chapter simply Electricity , rather than the more conventional Electricity and Magnetism . Experiment 2 . The Source Charges Have Constant Acceleration We now turn to the discussion of the second experiment , which is shown in Fig. 5-6b . In this case we assume that the source charges in the loop all have the constant magnitude of acceleration al ; that is , by ( 5-14 ) , di/dt == poal , where al is a nonzero constant . The source charges also have a velocity , so they will also be producing a magnetic induction field B , , at the field point P , but this does not concern us at present . The important experimental observation is this : A test charge q2 which is at rest in the laboratory now experiences a force F . Therefore , by definition , an electric field exists at P and equals F. , /q2 . We shall designate this field as E. It is known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is proportional to the acceleration al of the source charges and that it decreases with distance ( for r #@# diameter of the loop ) as l/r2 . Since Ei is proportional to the acceleration al of the source charges , it is only natural to think that this electric field arises by virtue of their acceleration . We shall see later , however , that this is not the case . Observed at P at the time t , E , is found to arise principally from the velocity that each source charge or possessed at the earlier time t ? ri/c ( r1 is the distance from qi as it was located at the time t ? r1/c to the field point P ) . The contributions to E , that come from the more distant parts of the loop ( side 1 ) have to leave earliest , and , by the time these signals pass the nearer parts of the loop ( side 3 ) , the charges there are in a different state of velocity ( in this case , a higher velocity ) . Whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contributions to E , corning from different parts of the loop cancel out , they no longer cancel out when the velocity  | vt of the source charges in the loop is time-varying . At the moment , however , we are concerned only with outlining the principal phenomenological effects of dynamic electricity , and we shall postpone until later the quantitative discussion of how , as a consequence of the finite velocity of signals retardation , the acceleration of the source charges in a loop reveals the existence of a velocitydependent electric field , which we shall call E. As we have already noted , this field , with its intrinsic dependence on the velocity of the source charges , may be shown to be the main contributor to Faraday 's experimentally observed electric induction field Ei near a loop carrying a time-varying current . The induction electric field has several important practical uses : the transformer , the inductance of a coil , and the betatron . In Sec. 5.7 we shall discuss further the nature of Ei and its relationship to these important applications . Experiment 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the last experiment in the series presented in Fig. 5-6 . In part c of the figure we once again require that the source charges ql be moving all together , but now their acceleration al has a time variation , and , in general , since i 0 and di/dt 0 , we shall expect that both B , and E. will be observed at the field point P , and this is in fact the case . In addition to these fields , however , the test charge reveals the existence of two new fields Ea and Ba , both of which are proportional to dal/dt and which decrease with distance according to 1/r . With da1/dt for the source charges directed in the counterclockwise sense ( as shown in the Fig. 5-6c ) and with the test charge q2 at rest , a force FE is observed acting on q2 in the ? y direction . It reveals the existence of a new electric field , which we shall call Ea . With the test charge q2 moving ( in the +y direction , for example ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) force FB is observed ( pointing in the x direction ) . It reveals the existence of a magnetic field pointing into the page at P , which we shall call Ba . Ea is called the electric radiation field , and Ba is called the magnetic radiation field . Basically , both arise from the acceleration of the source charges in the closed loop ; hence the subscript a . But they are not revealed when the acceleration is constant ; for then the contributions to each of these fields from the various parts of the loop add up to zero . When the acceleration is timevarying , however , the effect of retardation causes the different parts of the loop to be observed from P in different states of acceleration , thus destroying what originally was perfect cancellation and exposing the existence of the two fields . At the laboratory time t , at P , each field depends upon the acceleration that each source charge qt had at the earlier time t ? rt/c , where rt is the distance from qt ( as it was located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Retardation can also be described by giving the position , velocity , and acceleration of the source charge q , at the laboratory time t and then noting that the fields that are generated will not appear at the chosen field point meters distant , until the later  | The distinctive 1/r dependence of E , , and B ? means that , at large distances , these fields will be in each case relatively larger than the other two dynamic fields E and B. In the case of the loop , these latter fields decrease with distance much more rapidly ( according to 1/r2 and 1/r3 , respectively ) . It is found that the two radiation fields , which are propagated together at the velocity c in free space , can carry energy and momentum away from the source charges , even though the fields never encounter any other charges . That is , they can carry energy and momentum out into empty space . They form , of course , electromagnetic waves and are observed as radio signals and also as visible light , x-rays , y-rays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source charges . If , at some time t in the laboratory , a charge ql accelerates , then , at a point P ( r meters distant ) and at time t + rile , a signal composed of E , , and Ba will appear . We should note that the force FB , which arises from Ba acting on a moving test charge , is in practice very small . It was not , in fact , observed directly until some 40 years after its existence was postulated by Maxwell 's theory . It was observed as the pressure of light ( see example 5 : The Pressure of Light . ) In the plane of the loop , the electromagnetic radiation field is observed in all directions . Such a " radiating " loop is called a magnetic dipole transmitter . Its behavior is quantitatively analyzed in Sec. 5.7 . Although our discussion has been largely qualitative , we have seen how merely changing the state of motion of the source charges gives rise to different effects , which we have classified as the four fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field ; E , , the electric induction field ; B , , , the magnetic radiation field ; and Ea , the electric radiation field . The two dynamic electric fields ( and also the electrostatic field Ee ) are sensed by test charges whether they are at rest or in motion . The two dynamic magnetic fields are sensed only by test charges in motion and then only by the unique perpendicular-to-v force . No static magnetic field having properties similar to E , ; has ever been observed . Such a field would be produced by a " free magnetic pole , " which would be analogous to a point electric charge . Without any proof , we have asserted that E . may be regarded as being principally due to the velocity of the source charges and that E , , and B ? may be regarded as being due to the acceleration of the source charges . In the description of the next experiment , however , we shall see that these relationships are directly observable in a way that is not obscured by the complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loops . In spite of this complexity , we have nonetheless chosen to start our discussion using closed current-carrying loops , since these loops have played so crucial a role in the historical development of the theory of electricity . In addition , current loops are used in many practical electrical devices , such as motors , generators , and transformers , as well as in the transmission and reception of electromagnetic radiation ( " loop " antennas ) .  | Experiment 4 . The Source Charges Are Isolated and Are Accelerating : The Electric Dipole 7'ransnlittcr Up to now , we have discussed only the fields that are observed near currentcarrying loops in which many moving charges cooperate to produce the distinctive behavior of the test charge . We now describe an experiment in which a single isolated source charge is in a known state of motion . This experiment will reveal the specific association ( not immediately obvious in the case of the loops ) between the motion of the charge and each of the four fields . We take a single source charge q1 , place it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time t , give it a specified velocity v1 , a specified acceleration ai , and , if necessary , a specified dal/dt , etc . Then , at a distance rl from qi and at a later time t + r5/c ( for it is found experimentally that all electric and magnetic fields change their values at distant points with the speed of light , c ) , we look for the effect of the dynamic fields on the test charge q2 . In Fig. 5-7 , there are shown two source charges equal in magnitude but opposite in sign . The charge ? q1 is assumed to be fixed in the laboratory ; thus , it produces only an electrostatic field . The charge +q1 , however , which is located very near ? q1 but is not exactly superimposed on it , has ( at t = 0 ) the velocity vl and the acceleration al , both parallel to the y axis , with the directions shown in the figure . We assume that +q1 is caused to accelerate by the attractive electrostatic force from ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful function of partially canceling the electrostatic field generated by +q1 , greatly easing the task of observing the weaker dynamic fields generated by the motion of +q1 . At a distance r , which is large compared with the distance d separating the two source charges , we place a test charge q2 . First , q2 is at rest , so it can sense only electric fields . At the time t = r/c , q2 is observed to accelerate along the y axis , indicating that it is experiencing a total electric field E. In the particular example shown in Fig. 5-7 , E will he directed in the -1 y direction , since this it the direction of the vector sum of the three electric fields E , . , E , . , and E , , ,  | to be described below , each of which is parallel to they axis and which , together , form the total electric field E.* If the test charge q2 , is given a velocity v2 , in the y direction , for example , it will show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that caused by E. This new force is proportional to v2i and it is parallel to the x axis , thus indicating the existence of a net magnetic field B normal to the page . B is the vector sum of Ba and B , , , and whether it points into or out of the page depends upon the relative magnitude of the two contributions . Thus , although at the field point one observes only one electric and one magnetic field , all five of the basic fields of electricity can be distinguished , since the contribution to E made by each of the three electric fields and the contribution to B made by each of the two magnetic fields can be readily sorted out . Each depends in a distinctive manner on motion of the source charge q1 , and , in addition , the magnitude of each field has a characteristic dependence on r . The observations show that the five different fields observed at the field point at the laboratory time t depend in the following manner on the position , the velocity , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time t ? r/c : ( 1 ) The electrostatic field ( which arises from both of the source charges ) is given by figure  | figure These equations are based upon observations for which v c and are , therefore , correct only to the extent that this requirement is met . The equations for E ? and E ? are correct only if the field point is located in a direction normal to vl and al , respectively , as in Fig. 5-7 . For other directions , they must have additional terms . These will be given later . The equations for B ? and Bo are correct for all directions . We note that , because of the large constant 9 X 109 = 1/47rE0 characteristic of the electrostatic field , Ee is intrinsically very large . Compared with this constant , the characteristic constants of the other fields are all much smaller . For E , , , the constant is smaller by the factor 1/c ; for both Ea and B , , , the constant is smaller by the factor 1/c2 ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small characteristic constants make these fields intrinsically weak and , in the event that Ee is not greatly attenuated , difficult to observe . In describing Faraday 's **25;42;TOOLONG experiments using a loop carrying a constant current ( Fig. 5-6b ) , we attributed the force on the test charge to the electric induction field E. This field does not appear in the above list . The E ; field for Fig. 5-7 is just the vector sum of the Ee fields from +ql and ? qt plus the E ? field from +qr ( there is no E ? field from ? ql , since it is at rest ) . That is , the Ei field is simply the sum of all the electric fields except the radiation electric fields . Ei is a particularly useful concept for currentcarrying loops , and it is discussed in detail in Sec. 5.7 . We now note the distinctive dependence of each of five fields on r . We know from the study of electrostatics thatEe has an intrinsic dependence upon distance , of the form 1/r2 ; the combination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation d ) causes Ee to have the unusual direction shown in Fig. 5-7 and to depend upon 1/r3. * * This direction- and r-dependence of E. can readily be seen by reference to Fig. 5-7 , where d is the distance between the two charges at the time t = 0 . The charge +qi causes an E , field ( E , . ) , to appear at P ( at t r/c ) , pointing radially outward from +qi . Similarly , the charge ql causes an E , . field ( E ? ) 2 , pointing from P toward  --  qi . Since  | Both E , , and B , , depend upon distance as l /r9 . Both E ? and B , , , the radiation fields , depend upon distance as I/r . Thus , at very small distances , E , , will have the largest magnitude . At intermediate distances , E ? will be relatively important , although not necessarily dominant ; and , at very large distances , E ? will , on the average , be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will tend to have greater magnitude than B , , . Since , however , the dynamic fields are controlled also by either vl or al ( which are , in general , independently adjustable ) , it follows that , on an instantaneous basis , they can have a wide range of relative magnitudes and directions . Fortunately , there is one experiment that can , in principle , be used to demonstrate the full panopoly of fields , that is , Hertz 's spark transmitter . A simple form of this transmitter can be made from two conducting spheres , a centimeter or so in diameter , which are given equal and opposite electric charges . When the spheres are brought close together ( so that the gap is a small fraction of a millimeter ) , a spark will jump between them . The spark provides visible and audible evidence that , in the gap between the two spheres , the air becomes ionized and forms a very good conductor . The electrons , which were initially at rest on the negatively charged sphere , accelerate violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the conducting path is made available by the spark . Thus the basic electrostatic force is used to produce a very large effective acceleration and , also ( a short time later ) , a very large effective velocity of a localized group of charges . Owing in part to their own intrinsic inertia and also to the inductance effects characteristic of charges moving together , the electrons will overshoot ; that is , more of them will flow onto the initially positive sphere than are needed to neutralize it , momentarily reversing the signs of the charges on the two spheres . The electrons will then surge back toward the sphere from which they originally came ( which is now positive ) , but again they will overshoot . In practice , this oscillatory behavior will continue for three or four complete cycles before so much energy is lost ( mainly in the form of heat and visible light ) that the group motion of the electrons ceases , and the two spheres are both neutral . Experimentally , for spheres about 5 cm in diameter , the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oscillate more rapidly , and larger ones more slowly . With a very small probe or receiving antenna connected to a sensitive electronic amplifier , E , , E , , , and E ? can be observed , and their principal features ( which we have described above ) can be deduced . The direct observation of B , , and B , , requires the sensing of the perpendicular-to-v force acting on a moving test charge or , what amounts to the same thing , the torque on an assembly of spinning charges . The latter technique , using atomic- or nuclear-sized magnetic dipoles , is the only technique practicable for the direct detection of magnetic fields as weak and as rapidly d r , the angle 0/2 that each field makes with the x axis is approximately d/2r . The x components of the two E , fields are oppositely directed and cancel , whereas the two y components are both in the I y direction and add . The y components each have a magnitude ( I /4ne ? ) ( q/r ' ) ( 0/2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qd/r ' )  | oscillating as those produced by the simple spark transmitter , and , even by this means , for adequate sensitivity , wave trains much longer than 3 or 4 cycles are usually needed . The basic problem is simply that the forces arising from the magnetic fields are intrinsically small and , therefore , difficult to detect directly . I historically , B , , was observed and its properties measured by studying the forces between current-carrying wires . Ba , on the other hand , was first observed in a direct form by the pressure produced by light ( see example 5 ) . As an illustration of the relative magnitudes of the five fields , we shall consider a numerical example that corresponds rather closely to a real electric dipole transmitter . Let the source charge +q1 oscillate along the y direction , having the sinusoidal motion y = A sin 2irft ( 5-22 ) We shall assume that the fixed charge ? q1 is located at y = 0 and that , in effect , the positive charge moves right through the negative charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = d = 2irfA cos 27rft ( 5-23 ) and the acceleration is al dt = 4n2f 2A sin 27rft ( 5-24 ) Let q , = 10-6 coul , A = 10-3 meters , and f = 109 cycles per sec . Then the maximum values of v , and a1 are ( vi ) max = 6.3 x 106 m sec- ' ( al ) max = 4 x 1016 m sec-2 but they occur at different times ( one quarter of a cycle apart ) . Also , we note that dmax = A = 10-3 m . The magnitude of the acceleration is very great and is unattainable for macroscopic objects . We now use Eq . ( 5-18 ) through ( 5-22 ) to compute the numerical values of the maximum fields . Let r = 10 ? 1 m , which is large compared with A but less than the wavelength A of the radiation ( the wavelength is the distance that a signal will travel during one cycle ; here , A = of = 0.3 meter ) . For r = 10-1 meter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the oscillation , we obtain ( Ec ) max = 9 x 103 nt coul- ' ( Ev ) max = 19 x 103 nt coul- ' ( E , ) max = 40 x 103 nt coul-1 ( 13u ) max = 6.3 x 10- ' nt-sec coul- ' m-1 ( B ? ) max 13 x 10-5 nt-sec coul-1 m-1 Thus we see that , at this particular distance , the three electric fields are about the same order of magnitude , and the two magnetic fields also have roughly comparable magnitudes . This situation changes radically with r , however .  | For example , let the observation he made at r 102 meter , an increase in distance of a factor of 103 . At this distance , E , , is 103 times smaller , since it is proportional to 1/r ; E , , is 106 times smaller , since it depends on I /r2 ; and E , . is 109 times smaller , since it depends upon 1 /r3 . Similarly , B , , is 103 times smaller , and B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at large enough distances , the radiation fields inevitably dominate the others . We now illustrate the relative size of the force exerted on a test charge by the electric and the magnetic radiation fields ( for the case , r = 10  --  1 meter ) . Let us suppose that a positive test charge q2 = 1.6 X 10-19 coul is located at the field point in Fig. 5-7 and is moving , for example , in the +x direction with the velocity v2 = 3 X 10 ' m sec-1 ( this velocity , incidentally , is typical of electrons in a cathode-ray-tube beam ) . ( EE ) max by itself will produce a force of magnitude ( FE ) max = g2(Ea)max = 1.6 X 10-19 X 40 X 103 = 64 X 10-16 nt and ( BB ) max by itself ( since v2 Ba ) will produce a force of magnitude ( FB ) max = g2v2(Ba)max = 1.6 X 10-19 X 3 X 107 X 13 X 10-5 = 64 X 10-17 nt Both forces will be parallel to the y axis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velocity and acceleration vectors of the source charge had at a time earlier by r/c sec , and they will reach their maximum values one quarter of a cycle apart . We note that the magnetic force is only one tenth as large as the electric force . This follows from the fact that the formula for Ba has an extra c in the denominator , as compared with Ea , and the Lorentz magnetic-force formula has an extra term v2 in the numerator . Thus , the maximum force on the test charge from the magnetic radiation field will always be smaller than the maximum force from the electric radiation field by the factor v2/c , where v2 is the velocity of the test charge . We now ask : What maximum deflection of the beam of test charges would be produced by Ea and Ba ? First , we note that either force maintains a given direction for only 0.5 x 10-9 sec ( one half a cycle ) ; so we have to determine the deflection that would occur during this time interval . For simplicity of analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located at the field point in Fig. 5-7 and moving in the +x direction with a velocity of 3 X 107 meters per sec . For a time interval of 0.5 X 10-9 sec , the detecting particles will move only 1.5 x 10-2 meter . If , therefore , we wish to have all the particles in substantially the same fields for their whole time of flight At from the beginning of the beam to its end , we must have a total beam length that is substantially less than this distance ( 1.5 x 10-2 meter ) . We shall assume , therefore , that the particle beam is 0.5 x 10-2 meter in length from its origin to its terminus . So the time of flight for any one particle is At = 0.5 x 10- 2/ ( 3 x 107 ) = 0.17 X 10-9 sec . The beam terminates on a fluorescent screen , where it produces a sharply defined spot . The ( rapidly alternating ) deflection of this spot will be an indication of the presence of the fields . We are considering  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance of r 10 meter , the other fields would also be present in substantial intensity . 1. et the beam be composed of ( positive ) particles of mass m = 0.9 x 10 ? 3 ? kg ( the electronic mass ) . Since both forces happen in this case to be transverse to the beam velocity and since we assume that their initial y component is zero , they will each produce a deflection ( in the y direction ) of amount The force F due to ( E , , , ) max has a magnitude of 64 x 10 ? 16 nt . Also , m = 0.9 x 10-30 kg , and At = 0.17 x 10-9 sec ; so Ay 1 x 10-4 m = 1 x 10-2 cm a distance that is easily observable . The magnetic radiation field Ba will produce a maximum deflection of one tenth this amount . A stronger transmitter would produce large fields and larger deflections . If , by means of auxiliary equipment , the detection beam were deflected at a uniform rate in the z direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more easily observe the details of the time variation of the net force on the detection beam . Then , by making observations at different distances and by changing the velocity of the beam ( which changes the magnetic forces but not the electric forces ) , one could sort out the five fields and determine their characteristics experimentally . One result of making precise time measurements is that we can observe that all five fields are propagated with the speed of light , c . That is , each field is found to have a value at time t exactly correlated with the position , the velocity , and the acceleration possessed by the source charge at the earlier time t ? r/c . The experiment we have just been discussing is particularly significant in that all the features of electricity are displayed and this is accomplished with equipment that is , in concept , extremely simple . Although the classification of the effects of electricity in terms of the basic electrostatic field and the four electrodynamic fields may at first sight seem arbitrary , it is apparent from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associating the different aspects of the electromagnetic field with the sources that generate it . In some respects , the customary description of these fields using Maxwell 's equations is better than the description we use here , and in other respects the present method is superior . Directing one 's attention to the motion of the source charges often provides a vivid and intuitively satisfying picture of what is going on when charges influence each other . This method of describing the fields and forces also has the advantage that it has a particularly close and simple correspondence with effects predicted from relativity , starting with the basic Coulomb force ( and some auxiliary assumptions ) , as is discussed at length in Appendix I. No matter how they are described , however , there is no escaping the fact that the forces and fields of electrodynamics are subtle and complex .  | 5.5 The Relationship between Electrodynamics and Special Relativity An important step toward the discovery of the principle of special relativity was accomplished by H. A. Lorentz when he found that Maxwell 's equations were unchanged in form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Einstein ) which we referred to in Chap . 4 and which is now known as the Lorentz transformation . Indeed , considerations of electrodynamics in general and the behavior of light in particular were the bases for the formulation of relativity . This situation came about because , in the late nineteenth century , only objects with low velocities ( very small compared with c ) had been studied with any care , and therefore the only recognizable relativistic effects were those connected with electrodynamics , where , because of the unique existence of particles of opposite sign , extremely minute relativistic effects could be observed with ease . Now electricity ( and magnetism ) is a particular theory about a particular type of force fields , whereas relativity is a principle of universal validity . It is not surprising , therefore , that , starting from the more general principle , one can deduce at least the main features of the particular theory . Appendix I outlines how the principal characteristics of the four dynamic fields we hate discussed can be determined with the aid of simple arguments based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject in an appendix , since , even in its simplest form , the analysis is fairly lengthy and is not , furthermore , essential for the rest of this chapter , which is concerned with stating and applying the laws of the electric and magnetic fields deduced from Maxwell 's equations for the case of charges in a known state of motion . In this section , therefore , we shall merely state the gist of the argument and leave the details to Appendix I. In addition to the theory of relativity , we employ the experimental fact of Coulomb 's law . Also , we assume ( 1 ) that the intrinsic electric charge of a particle is unchanged by its state of motion , ( 2 ) that all signals in electrodynamics are transmitted with velocity c , and ( 3 ) that electrostatic potential energy has inertial properties . From this we deduce the principal features of the four dynamics fields by the following analysis : ( 1 ) We observe that two charges of the same sign undergo mutual acceleration when released from rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both been given a velocity v in the laboratory , normal to the line r joining them . When observed in motion , the charges are observed to accelerate normal to v , but with a lower acceleration ( due to time dilatation ) . This reduced acceleration is explained by assuming that , in addition to the electric force between the two particles , there exists also a velocity force between the two particles ( which in this case is attractive ) . This force has just the properties that are predicted on the basis of B ? and the Lorentz force law . ( 2 ) We assume that the mutual electrostatic energy of assembly L 1R ' q/47reor of two charges q , each of rest mass iuo and separated by a distance r ,  | has inertial mass of amount d W/c2 . The two charges are accelerated together in a direction normal to r . The reduced acceleration that arises from the fact that the inertial mass of the assembly of charges is now 2mo + Ll W/c2 rather than 2mo is explained by assuming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an electric field at the other charge , directed opposite to the acceleration . This field is found to have the properties of Ea . This method of analysis breaks down when the two charges are accelerated parallel to r ? which is interpreted as showing that , although the electrostatic field energy has some inertial properties , it nonetheless does differ from ordinary mass . This latter case is discussed in Appendix II . ( 3 ) By requiring that the inertia of the electrostatic field energy be independent of the first power of the velocity of an assembly of charges ( an indispensable property of inertia ) , we obtain E. ( 4 ) By accelerating the two charges that were used to deduce B , , , in a direction parallel to their mutual velocity , we show that a magnetic field having the properties of Ba can be expected to exist . The analysis in Appendix I does not attempt to be complete , and the deviation of electromagnetic mass from ordinary mass shows that at least one of the assumptions we have used in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complete and general deduction of electrodynamics , starting from Coulomb 's law and exploiting relativity but employing somewhat different assumptions , may be found in a recent book by P. C. Shedd. * ( ) ur principal purpose here is to show that the four electrodynamic fields are intimately related to relativity and that they provide a useful method of classification of electrodynamic phenomena . 5.6 The Fields of Moving Charges as Observed in Electricity At the time Maxwell formed his theory ( about 1870 ) , the effects that we have ascribed to the elctrostatic field Ee , the induction electric field E2 , and the induction magnetic field B , had been observed . But , in these early experiments , which used only current-carrying loops and permanent magnets ( which act like coils carrying a constant current ) , there was as yet no experimental evidence of the effects we have ascribed to Ea and Ba , t In order to make a workable set of equations , Maxwell found it necessary . to postulate a term known as the displacement current , which was not directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any region containing a time-varying electric field , there existed also a corresponding ? Paul C. Shedd , Fundamentals of Electromagnetic Waves . Englewood Cliffs , N. J. : Prentice-hall , Inc. , 1954. t As is shown in Sec. 5.7 , it is extremely difficult to observe the radiation fields very close to a loop carrying a current that is oscillating in direction even as rapidly as a few thousand cycles per second . This is due to the presence of the very much larger induction hells.  | magnetic field . The set of partial differential equations in E and B that resulted from the terms demanded by the existing experiments together with the new term led directly to the prediction that fields having the characteristics of E , , and Ba both existed and that they were propagated through space with the velocity c . Ea was observed by Hertz some 15 years later using a spark transmitter , but the direct observation of Ba ( that is , the characteristic perpendicularto-v force due to Ba on a moving test charge ) was not made until Petr Lebedev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hull observed it in 1903 ( see example 5 ) . Starting from Maxwell 's equations for the case in which the position , the velocity , and the acceleration of an isolated source charge are specified , one can deduce the five fields we have been discussing , including their full angular dependence. * Alternatively , one could make careful measurements near a dipole transmitter , sort out all the fields , and determine by experiment all their characteristics ( for the case v . c ) . At this point , however , we shall simply state the complete formulas for the five fields . In Appendix I we have justified their form for certain special cases , using the theory of relativity , but the formulas stated below will be treated simply as postulates and will be used to calculate the behavior of charges in various states of motion . In Table 5-1 , we tabulate the complete fields , the force law for test charges , and the principal definitions of electricity . This table contains an essentially complete theory of electricity for the case in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although we assume that the test charges are small enough not to react to a significant degree on the source charges , it is possible , in principle , to make a series of approximations in which the ( delayed ) influence of the moving test charges on the source charges and vice versa can be allowed for . Thus , although we use relatively simple vector formulas instead of partial differential equations , the formulation of electricity ( and magnetism ) given in Table 5-1 is of broad applicability.t The only items present in Table 5-1 that we have not yet discussed are the additional terms in the numerators of E ? and Ea that give their complete angular dependence . It is clear that the numerator ( 3v ? i ) i v of the new expression for E , reduces to ? v for the case v L I , in agreement with ( 5-19 ) , since in this case v = O. Also , the numerators x ( r x a ) of Ea reduces to ? a for the case a L r , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * See , for example , W. K. H. Panofsky and M. Phillips , Classical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism . Cambridge , Mass. , Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. , Inc. , 1955 , p. 299. 1- If both the source charge and the test charge are isolated charges , then the relativistic correction to the electrostatic field E , , whose magnitude is proportional to v5/cz see the footnote to Eq . ( 5-18 ) , and also Appendix I , Eq . ( I-15 ) , produces effects on the motion of the test charge which are often of the same order of magnitude as the magnetic forces . ? The expression 1 ' X ( 1 ' X a ) signifies that one is to form ( 1 ) the cross product x a , obtaining a new vector b ( of magnitude I x a sin 90 " a ) , which is normal to the plane ofr and a ; and ( 2 ) the vector products x b , obtaining the final vector ( also of magnitude a ) . Thus , whenr I a , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B(t) are observed at the field point P at time t , but the position the velocity v , and the acceleration a of the source charge q pertain all to the earlier time t r/c . Specifically , r points from q as it was at t r/c toward the field point P. 1 nt-sec caul m or I weber m 2 IO ' ' gauss  | For the case v II a and both v it and a I 2 , the five fields of Table 5-1 have the directions shown in Fig. 5-8 , and the magnitudes are given by the formulas as they were originally listed in Eq . ( 5-18 ) through ( 5-22 ) . . Both the above figures require a little practice for their interpretation . The source charge is shown at one time , t ? r/c , and the fields at the point P at a later time , t . A more realistic description of what is going on would be provided by a sequence of diagrams , the first showing the position and motion of the Fic. 5-9 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of motion .  | source at the specified instant , and subsequent ones showing only the fields as they progress outward , finally arriving at the point I ' after an interval of r/c sec . For simplicity , however , we condense this sequence into one figure , showing the source at one time and the fields at a distant point P at a later time . We now return to a more detailed discussion of Fig. 5-9 . E , , is usually many orders of magnitude larger than the other electric fields and points radially outward from P ( along r ) . E , . is described by two components . One is radial ( along ' ) , and the other is directed opposite to v. The vector sum of these two components is the total electric induction field E. This expression for E , may seem rather complicated , but , for the case of the isolated charge , there is no simpler way of describing this particular field . For the special but very important case in which the source charges are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a simple way of describing the combined effects of E , and E , , , or Ei . We discuss Ei near the end of Sec. 5.7 . The electric radiation field Ei , has its direction and acceleration dependence expressed by the term i ? x ( r x a ) . In calculating this vector , we first determine r x a , which points out of the page and has the magnitude a sin 0 , since the angle between r and x a is 90 degrees . If we define aj as the component of a normal to f ( shown as the dotted vector a1 in Fig. 5-9 ) , then , in general , r X ( r x a ) = ? a ( 5-25 ) and we can write Ea more simply : El ? 4rq c2 ? a1 a1 = a sin 0 ( 5-26 ) Similarly , since the term a x r , which appears in the numerator of Ba , also has the magnitude a sin 0 , we can describe Ba by q a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5-27 ) 0c3 We see that the magnitude of each of the radiation fields is directly proportional to the projection of a normal tor . When the field point is located along the extension of a , then the projection of a normal to r is zero ( 0 = 0 ) , and there is no radiation ; but , when the field point is in a direction normal to a ( B 90 ? ) , the radiation is a maximum . Equations ( 5-26 ) and ( 5-27 ) are often the most convenient formulas to use in computing the radiation fields . The five fields in Table 5-1 are all observable near the electric oscillating dipole in forms that correspond closely to those given in the equations . In Sec. 5.7 , which follows , we show that the electric and magnetic fields of ' fable 5-1 also explain quantitatively the experimental effects associated with current-carrying loops that were discussed in connection with Fig. 5-6 . I n the examples , Sec. 5.8 , we shall illustrate the application of these formulas to a number of simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Currentcarrying Loops In order to analyze the fields produced by loops in which many electric charges are in motion , we first ask the question : What happens if there are two or more charges , both of which are producing fields at some field point I ' ? The fields , of course , superimpose by ordinary vector addition , the E fields all adding together to make a total E field , and the B fields all adding together to make a total B field . But there is one very important point to remember : If the two source charges qi and q2 have different distances rl and r2 from the selected field point , then the signals must depart from the charges as they were at different earlier times . If , for example , as in Fig. 5-10 , r2 is greater than r1 , Fla. 5-10 In order for the signals from ql and q2 to arrive at the field point P at the same time t , it is necessary for the signal from q2 to leave earlier ( at t ? r2/c ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( at t ? rl/c ) , since q2 is farther from P. then q2 is observed from P at the time t with the position , velocity , and acceleration it had at the ( earliest ) time t ? r2/c , and q2 is observed as it was at the somewhat later time t ? r1/c . Thus , three different parts of Fig. 5-10 refer to three different times . They are related by the fact that the fields arising from the two source charges arrive at P at a common instant , t . If the velocity of the two charges in Fig. 5-10 is time-varying , that is , if the charges are accelerating , then , since the charges are viewed from P as they were at different earlier times , they will be seen in different states of velocity . It is the effect of retardation that makes the loop experiments of Fig. 5-6 appear so different from the experiments with the electric dipole transmitter of Fig. 5-7 , in which there was only one moving charge . The fundamental phenomena , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 ) a loop in which the charges all have the same constant speed vo , ( 2 ) a loop in which all the charges have the same constant magnitude of acceleration ao , and ( 3 ) a loop in which all the charges have the same da/dt . These three cases correspond to the three basic experiments discussed with reference to Fig. 5-6 . In applying the formulas of Table 5-I , we shall employ a loop that has a special shape , selected so as to simplify the calculations .  | The Fields of a Loop Carrying a Constant Current . Our immediate objective is to show why no electric field is observed near a loop that is carrying a constant current , even though there is an electric field E ? generated by virtue of the velocity of the charges . We consider the loop shown in Fig. 5-11a . Two of the sides ( 2 and 4 ) are pointing directly at the chosen field point P , and the other two sides are normal to the line from the center of the loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensions of the loop , b and d , are both considered to be very small compared with ro . We assume that there are many charges of uniform density po coul per meter moving in unison around the loop at the constant speed N. The charges are symbolized by the equally spaced dots in Fig. 5-11a , where we draw the loop as it would appear at some common instant of laboratory time . * ( a ) As viewed at a common instant of laboratory time , t = 0 . ( h ) As viewed from P at t = ( ro - I-  b/2 ) /c , where , because of the effects of retardation , side 2 appears to have a deficiency , and side 4 an axcess , of charges . Flee 5-11 Charges flowing in a loop at the constant speed Vo . ? In principle , this observation can be made as follows : A very large number of observers , all equipped with identical clocks , are assumed to be located around the perimeter of the loop and are at relit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 4 : They are started by a light pulse coming from hone single point ,  | All the calculated fields will 1w found to depend only on the area bd of the loop . The special shape chosen for Fig. 5-1 I does not limit the generality of the results , provided only that both of the linear dimensions of any loop are small compared with the distance to the field point . Also , for simplicity , we shall not compute the fields for points lying out of the plane of the page . ' These limitations may seem rather severe , but the fact is that the accurate calculation of any electrodynamic field ( except in a very small number of highly symmetrical cases ) is always extremely complicated . Our purpose is merely to apply the theory in the simplest possible cases . We shall need to know the normal amount of charge on each side of the loop , which is defined as po times the length of the side . Thus , to a very good approximation , the normal total charge on side 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 is q4 = pob ( 5-29 ) On the other hand , the length of side 1 is d + 8b/2 , where 8 d/ro ; thus , the normal total charge on side 1 is 4t = pod ( 1 + 2br0 ) ( 5-30 ) and on side 3 is 43 = pod ( 1 2r0 ) ( 5-31 ) Since , at any given instant , an observer at P does not see all parts of the loop as they were at the same laboratory time and since the charges are moving , it is not surprising that the density of the charges appears to be different in different parts of the loop . Figure 5-11a shows the charges as they are actually located at t = O. At this instant , let a light signal leave point A , indicating the presence of the particular charge located at A. As this light signal proceeds in the direction of P , it sweeps over other charges , each of which adds its signal to the original one . The signals from all the charges from A to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A will arrive at P together , indicating by their total intensity the number of charges that appear to be located on side 2 . Now , it takes b/c sec for the light signal to proceed from A to B , and , during this time , each charge in the loop will have traveled a distance vo(b/c) meters along the loop . This means that , while the light signal was proceeding from A to B " counting " the charges , a total charge of amount povo(b/c) turned the corner at B. When these charges are counted ( as they will be ) they are found on side 3. at a known distance ri from each clock i , and then the hands of each clock are set back a time ri/c . As a result , all clocks read a common time , which we call the laboratory time . At some selected laboratory time t , each observer records whether or not a charge is located in spatial coincidence with him . The results of all these observations are then sent to some common point and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the laboratory at the chosen common laboratory time t.  | " Thus , at the instant t ( ro I h/2 ) /c the total charge that , observed at P , appears to he located on side 2 is Pob ? Povo = Pob ( 1 ? ) ( 5-32 ) ' I'hus , the charges along side 2 appear to be stretched out , having wider spacing than normal , as is shown in Fig. 5-lib . This figure shows charges at many different times . They are all related by the fact that their signals all arrive at P at a common instant t = ( r0 + b/2 ) /c . During the transit time b/c of the light signal across the loop , the same number of charges turn each corner ; thus , when the charges on side 3 send in their signals ( all at the same time ) the normal number are present there . However , as the information-collecting sphere that is shrinking down on the field point P proceeds from D to C along side 4 , it will intercept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 at t = 0 plus the charges that turned the corner from side 3 . This excess charge is  |p0v0(b/c)  ; thus , the total apparent charge on side 4 is Like side 3 , side 1 has the normal number of charges . Thus , all the moving charges are accounted for , but side 2 appears to have a deficiency of moving charges , and side 4 appears to have an exactly corresponding excess . We assume that the loop is electrically neutral ; that is , there is a uniform density po of negative charges at rest along the loop ( as usual , we regard the positive charges as moving ) . Sides 1 and 3 have exactly the same number of moving and rest charges ( as viewed from P ) ; therefore , the net electrostatic field Ea at P due to sides 1 and 3 is exactly zero . Side 4 , however , has an excess of positive charge and produces at P a net E. field ( Ee ) 4i which points from P away from side 4 ( see Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p0h(v0/c)  , the magnitude of ( Ee ) 4 is  | Although , for currents in wires , vo/c is of the order of 10 ' or even less , and , therefore , the imbalance between the total charge on side 2 and that on side 4 is correspondingly small , nonetheless , because of the very large magnitude of Ee , the effect is important . It turns out that it is precisely this fractionally small imbalance that cancels out the intrinsic velocity-dependent field E ? produced by the moving charges . To obtain the total E ? - field produced by the moving charges we use the complete formula for E ? given in Table 5-1 . Agreement with the calculated results in this and other experiments provides a check on this particular vector formula for E. First , consider side 1 . Here vo + r1 ; so 3vo r1 = 0 , and the numerator of E ? becomes ( 3vo ? 1.1 ) x1 ? vo = ? vo ( 5-37 ) and the E ? field produced at P by side 1 is given by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 2 + y direction ( 5-38 ) where , since side 1 has the normal density of moving charge , by ( 5-30 ) , q1 is pod ( 1 + b/2ro ) . The charges are all moving in the ? y direction , so ( E , ) , is directed in the +y direction . For side 3 , vo is again normal to the unit vector r3i and ( Ev ) 3 is given by an expression similar to ( 5-38 ) :  | which , at all velocities vo , is seen to cancel out the total electrostatic field ( 5-36 ) . Thus , in agreement with experiment , a loop at rest carrying a constant current noevo = povo is calculated to produce no net external electric field . If the current-carrying loop is not at rest in the laboratory , however , the exact balance between the net Ee field and the net E ? field is upset . The velocity of the charges along the various sides as seen from P is now changed ( because of the added velocity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric field does appear at P. We shall not attempt to anlyze this case , since the calculation is complicated in detail , although not in principle . It is simpler to calculate the result for this case by letting the loop be at rest and having the test charge move ( see discussion immediately below ) . We now calculate the net magnetic induction field B ? produced by the constant-current loop of Fig. 5-11 . The magnetic field of a charge q is given by B = v x 47re0c2 Y2 As before , we calculate the contribution to B ? from each of the four sides of the loop and add them vectorially . The apparent charges on sides 1 and 3 are the normal amounts ( 5-30 ) and ( 5-31 ) , respectively , and the apparent charges on sides 2 and 4 are given by ( 5-32 ) and ( 5-33 ) . In this case , however , since we are directly calculating a magnetic field , which is already a small quantity , we may neglect the fact that the moving charge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge on side 4 is very slightly in excess of normal . Thus , we may use the normal charge density po in all the calculations for B. Referring to Fig. 5-1la , we note first that for sides 2 and 4 the terms v ? X r2 and vo x I are both zero . So these sides make no contribution to  | where povo = io , the constant electric current flowing around the loop , and bd is the area of loop , in agreement with the experimentally observed relationship ( 5-16 ) . Let us consider a numerical example . A square loop , 10 cm on a side , carrying a current of 100 amp will produce at a distance of 10 meters ( in the plane of the loop ) a magnetic induction field of amount B 9 X 109 X 102 x ( 10 ? 1 ) 2 10-1 nt-sec cowl-1 m-1 , or weber m-2 v ( 3 x 103 ) 2 x 103 This field is called the magnetic dipole field . The Fields of a Loop in Which the Current Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the second of the basic experiments with the current-carrying loops of Fig. 5-6 . In this experiment , the charges in the loop are accelerating at a constant rate in the counterclockwise sense , and an electric field E , - is observed at P , pointing in the ? y direction . We shall now calculate this field and show that it arises because of the existence of the velocitydependent electric field E , , . With the aid of Fig. 5-12 , we shall first describe qualitatively the means by which the electric induction field appears and then analyze the experiment in more detail . In Fig. 5-12a , the charges in the loop are seen at one common instant of laboratory time and have a uniform density po . At t = 0 they are moving in unison , with the same speed vo and with the same magnitude of acceleration ao , a constant . Now , however , the speed of the charges is increasing at a constant rate , and , as viewed from P at the later time t = ( r0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( those along side 1 ) are seen to have the speed vo ( see Fig. 5-12b ) . By the time the information-collecting sphere ( which we assume departs from side 1 at t = 0 ) reaches the nearer side of the loop ( side 3 ) , the speed of the charges has increased to vo + ao(b/c) , since the charges on side 3 were accelerating during the entire time interval b/c required for the light signal to cross the loop . As before , the apparent charge density on sides 1 and 3 is normal , but the apparent charge density on side 2 is subnormal , having the value po ( 1  --  vas , /c ) ,  | figure The velocity vav is the average velocity of the charges over the time interval 0 to t = b/c , as viewed from P. Actually , of course , the charges all have the same velocity at any given instant of laboratory time , but this velocity is increasing uniformly with time , and , as the information-collecting sphere sweeps over the charges on side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times and , therefore , at different velocities .  | Compared with the case where v is constant , ( li , , ) a now has an additional term ( the term proportional to ao ) , and so side 3 contributes a larger electric induction field in the ? y direction . As might be expected , the vector sum of E. and E. , , from all four sides of the loop is now no longer zero , but has a net value in the direction of the new term on the right in ( Ev ) 3i that is , in the ? y direction . This calculation is made in detail in Appendix III , where it is found that the sum of Ee and Ev for all the charges in the loop , to which we give the designation As is shown in Appendix III , a part of E , is proportional to vav/ro , and this part exactly cancels a similar term arising from Ee , leaving exposed to view that part of Ev which is proportional to ao/ro . Thus , E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , directly produced by the velocity of the source charges . It is , however , exposed to view only when the speed of the charges in the loop is not constant . We now show that , when the charges in the loop have a constant acceleration , there are no radiation fields at P. For Ea , we use ( 5-26 ) , that is , Thus , ( Ea ) , exactly cancels ( Ea ) 3 , and we have the final result that , when the acceleration is constant , Ea is exactly zero . The analysis for Ba is very similar to that for Ea . Sides 2 and 4 each contribute zero , since , for them , a x r is zero . Also the contributions from sides 1 and 3 cancel exactly . Thus , ( 5-53 ) is the only electric field produced by the loop when the acceleration of the charges is constant . We can readily compute B , , for the loop of Fig. 5-12 . Sides 2 and 4 contribute nothing , since , for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term whose b1.EC'TRIC ' AND MAGNETIC ' FIELDS 195 magnitude is identical with ( E , , ) , of ( 5-51 ) , except that an extra factor of c appears in the denominator . Its direction is out of the page . Side 3 contributes a term to B ? which is identical in magnitude with ( E , , ) 3 of ( 5-52 ) , except for the extra c in the denominator , and it points into the page . The sum of the B ? fields from all four sides is The first term , with its 1/ro dependence , is the magnetic dipole field . The second term in ( 5-56 ) has the same a0/ro dependence as the Ei field ( 5-53 ) , which arises from the same loop , and is also generated by the velocity of the charges , but it is observable only when the velocity changes during the transit time of light across the loop . As a numerical example , we compute the electric and magnetic induction fields of a loop for which b = d = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i =  |p0v  , then di/dt =  |p0a  . At a given time t = 0 , let the current be 102 amp , and let it change at the constant rate of 103 amp in 10-3 sec ; that is ,  |p0v0  = 102 amp , and di/dt =  |p0a0  = 106 amp sec-1 . Then , using ( 5-53 ) , I f the acceleration of the charges is in the counterclockwise sense , as in Fig. 5-12 , then Ei at P will be directed in the ? y direction . I ii this example , the acceleration-dependent term in B is much smaller than the velocity-dependent term , but , at large enough distances , because of its dependence on 1/r2 ( rather than 1/r3 ) , the acceleration-dependent term would dominate . A Simple Formula for Ei Although from a conceptual standpoint the total electric field Ei = Ee + Ev produced by a loop in which the charges are accelerating uniformly may be considered to exist by virtue of the velocity of the charges ( whose effect is exposed to view by retardation ) it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? as we have done above . The same result can be obtained by a simpler expression . If we assume that each element of a current of length Lll containing a total charge po Al produces at the field point P the electric field 4E. ,  | where a is the acceleration of all the charges in the current element , then , if we apply this formula to closed loops , we get the same result as ( 5-53 ) , where we used Ee + E. That is , the use of ( 5-59 ) automatically allows for the existence of Ee and also for the effects of retardation . To demonstrate the correctness of this new formula for computing the electric induction fields of loops , we apply it to the loop in Fig. 5-12a . From side 1 , which has a charge density po and a length dl = d ( 1 + b/2ro ) , we obtain an Ei field at P given by so the contributions from sides 1 and 3 exactly cancel . From side 2 , which has the charge density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : from P , away from side 4 ( 5-63 ) The vector sum of ( dEi ) 2 and 0E04 is directed in the ? y direction and has the magnitude 0E02(9/2) + ( LEi ) 4(8/2) where 8 d/ro ; thus , for d ro , in agreement with Eq . ( 5-53 ) , which was obtained by using the more complicated calculation that allowed for retardation , etc . An Example of Ei : The Betatron As an example of the use of either ( 5-53 ) or ( 5-64 ) , we shall compute the energy gained by a single positive particle of electronic mass in one complete circuit of the secondary path , in Fig. 5-13 . We suppose that the particle is free to move along the circular secondary path , starting from rest at point P. The particle is guided by a specially prepared magnetic field , which , at every instant , is given just the correct magnitude to keep the charged particle on the specified circular path in spite of the fact that it is accelerating . We note that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path and has a  | constant magnitude at all points on the secondary . Thus , the charged particle will be uniformly accelerated along the path during its entire trip . I , et i in the primary loop change by 1000 amp in 10-4 sec , and let r1 = An example of the calculation of the electric induction field ? the Betatron . The force on the positive particle of charge 1.6 x 10-19 coul is in the clockwise sense , as shown by EZ in Fig. 5-13 . It has the magnitude Force = 3.14 x 10-2 x 1.6 x 10-19 = 5.03 x 10-21 nt and the work done on the particle when it makes one complete turn is Work = ( force ) ( 2rrr ? ) = 31.6 x 10-21 joule ( 5-66 ) The particle 's rest mass is 0.9 x 10 ? 30 kg , and its tangential acceleration is 5.6 ; , 109 meters per sec per sec . In t = 10-4 sec , it will travel a distance of iat2 - 28 meters , or 4.4 complete turns . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counterclockwise sense in Fig. 5-13 . I f the unit charge of 1 coul were released on the secondary , then , in one turn , E , would do work in amount 3.14 X 10-2 joule ; so the emf of circuital potential around the secondary is 3.14 x 10-2 volts per turn . Figure 5-13 illustrates graphically the circuital , or curling , nature of the electric induction field E , ( and E ? ) . Its behavior stands in sharp contrast with the simple radial patterns of the electric field vectors belonging to the electrostatic field E , coming from charges at rest .  | The Relationship between F ; and Faraday 's Law of Induction . The method we have been using to compute B ? and the force on a moving test charge that it produces is essentially the same as that used in the customary formulation of electromagnetism , but the employment of E , is not quite so common . The induction electric field , however , is closely related to Faraday 's law of induction . If the total magnetic flux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where B , , , is the normal component of B at the area element dA , then Faraday 's law of induction may be written The electromotive force ( emf ) is defined as the work done on a unit positive charge by the electric field E in one complete turn around C. The E of ( 5-68 ) is the induction electric field K. This follows from the definition of the vector potential A ( A = curl B ) of an electric current i flowing in a fixed circuit : and from Maxwell 's equations ( where the path of the charges is time independent ) : circuit of source charges Thus , E may be visualized as the vector sum of the E , fields as defined in Eq . ( 5-59 ) above . What our earlier discussions have shown is this : The E2 of the slowly varying , or quasi-static , currents of electrodynamics does not arise from the acceleration of the source charges per se , but rather from a combination of E , ; and E , , plus the subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example of Faraday 's law ( 5-68 ) . Let the source or primary current start from zero and increase in the counterclockwise sense , as shown . Then B points out of the page within the primary loop and into the page everywhere else . A detailed calculation using Faraday 's law shows that there is a net increase in the flux coming out of the page and that the emf is just E , 271-r0 , where F. , has the value calculated by ( 5-53 ) or  | Radiation from a Loop in Which the Charges Have a Time-varying Acceleration . To complete our discussion of the basic loop experiments of Fig. 5-6 , we examine the case in which the source charges have a time-varying acceleration . In Fig. 5-14 we show the standard loop with the same time-varying acceleration as in Fig. 5-6c . Bo ( into the page ) figure We assume that all the charges move in unison and that their acceleration is given by a = ao + kt ( 5-71 ) where k is a positive constant . The loop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 and the other parts at suitably later times . At t = 0 , all the charges have the acceleration ao , and it is from this state of motion that the charges on side 1 transmit their signal toward P. By the time this signal has reached side 3 , however ( a delay of b/c sec ) , all the charges have the larger acceleration a3 = as -+ k ( 5-72 ) Whereas in the case a = const , the radiation field from side 3 exactly canceled that from side 1 , now , because of the larger acceleration at side 3 , the signals from side 3 will exceed those from side 1 , producing a net radiation field . The contribution of side 1 to Ea is still given by ( 5-54 ) ; that is , ( E ? ) 1 47reoa ro + y direction ( 5-73 ) The contribution to Ea from side 3 now differs from ( 5-55 ) , however , in that we must use the new value for the acceleration ( 5-72 ) . Thus ,  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
