txt Mayor Lindsay announced yesterday that he would seek a second term . " I run because too much is at stake to abandon the effort my administration has begun , " he said , adding later in his state-ment : " I do n't intend to abandon this effort to better the quality of life in New York  --  not without a fight . " Standing with an impressive array of elected Republicans and party fund-raisers , Mr. Lindsay said his fight would begin in the party 's primary against " reactionary elements that seek to destroy the progressive traditions of Republicanism in New York . " 1965 Scene Recalled The Mayor said that he would enter the June 17 Republican primary  --  against two conservatives , Senator John J. Marchi and Assemblyman Vito P. Battista  --  and would again seek the nomination of the Liberal party , which supported him in 1965 . The setting and tone of the announcement were sharply different from four years ago , when Mr. Lindsay , then a Manhattan Representative , stood alone except for his family in the Concourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor with a pledge to halt " the decline and fall of New York . " Yesterday , by contrast , he was in the ballroom of Gracie Mansion , where sunlight sparkled on the crystal chandeliers . Other Leaders Present With him were not only Mrs. Lindsay , three of the Lindsay children and the Mayor 's brothers , nephews , and nieces , but also Governor Rockefeller ; Senators Jacob K. Javits and Charles E. Goodell ; former Gov . Thomas E. Dewey , Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz , John Hay Whitney , the financier ; Gustave L. Levy , chairman of the New York Stock Exchange ; Herbert Brownell , former United States Attorneys General , and Mrs. Fiorello H. La Guardia . " I wo n't pretend my administration has been without error or disappointment , " he told the roomful of reporters , friends and scores of high city officials . " You can not achieve fundamental changes in a city of eight million people without mistakes . But we have a record ? in the tasks we have accomplished , the directions we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As the Mayor began , " I will run for re-election . . . " there was sustained applause from the Vows of people wearing red , green , orange , lavender and brown buttons that said simply : " Mayor Lindsay . " ' There was another wave of applause later when he hesitated for a moment , then said : " I intend to run a campaign I can be proud of , for I would rather lose because of what I believe in than win by betraying the principles I have stood f Or : " There were some cheers and a few boos for Mr. Lindsay as he began his campaign a few hours later with walking tours of Astoria in Queens , and Bensonhurst and Bedford-Styvesant in Brooklyn . The mood was mild compared to the uproar during his ghetto walks last summer and his recent trudges through snow-clogged streets in Queens . He heard curses in Astoria , but in Bensonhurst he caught an apple tossed to him by a smiling grocer and he grinned in response ' to applause and shouts of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone told him what two women were saying in the doorway of a beauty parlor on Nostrand Avienue in " Brooklyn : " He 's sure aged a lot in four years ! " Ovation in Flatbush Last night Mr. Lindsay visited the Flatbush Republican Club at 2431 Church Avenue , Brooklyn , where 200 party workers gave him a standing ovation . ? The Mayor , who was escorted into the barnlike building by an honor guard of 10 Boy Scouts , delivered a brief speech that warned against attacks from the Conservative party . Later , outside the Bay Ridge Republican Club at 8501 Seventh Avenue , 50 demonstrators shouted ' ' Down with Lindsay ! " as the Mayor arrived to address 300 supporters who were crowded inside . Some demonstrators displayed Conservative party stickers , others wore American ' Independent party buttons and several carried placards ? complaining about snow-removal problems . Three hundred persons inside applauded the Mayor , who said : " I have complete faith that the voting public  --  overwhelmingly Democratic as it is  --  will not put party first over good government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles came when his 8-year-old son , John Jr. , finally took his hands out of his pockets to clap for his father and when Governor Rockefeller stepped ? up to the microphones and said : " I hope he wins in the primary . I hope he wins the general election . I want to lay to rest ' those reports of a feud between me and the Mayor . John , best of luck to you ? thanks for inviting me . " After other Republican officials had added their endorsements , the Lindsay family moved out to ? the mansion porch overlooking the East River . The scene was the same as in 1965 : Photographers asked Mrs. Lindsay and her daughters to kiss the Mayor and they politely said they did their kissing in private . There was an indication earlier that the family was not quite unanimous in wanting Mr. Lindsay to go through another campaign . When the Mayor said in his announcement , " My wife , Mary , and our four children join ' me in this decision , " one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " After the picture-taking , the Mayor slipped down to his basement office with his campaign manager , Richard R. Aurelio ; and they began the next phase of the campaign  --  discussing running mates for City Council President and ControlMore than two dozen potential candidates are still under consideration and Mr. Lindsay was said to have " a completely open mind " ' on the subject . The candidacy statement was drafted to emphasize some of the things Mr. Lindsay feels he has accomplished ? expansion and modernization of the police force , reduced air pollution , increased use of parks , modernization of the transit system , balanced budgets and middleincome housing construction records . The Mayor indirectly reacted to criticism of violence in the schools and his efforts to decentralize the school system by saying : ' We took ? on the job of making our school system work for our children . More new schools are being built than ever before . And , despite the tragic strike and confrontation in our schools  --  a period as regrettable to me as it was to everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the children and parents they are designed to serve is a valid one . " No matter who is elected Mayor in November , the years ahead will not be easy . " We must insure that the law is respected , obeyed and enforced  --  and that changes are sought only through peaceful means . " Theme of Campaign At the beginning of his statement , the Mayor in effect defined what is expected to be the theme of his campaign : " I run because too much is at stake to abandon the effort my administration has begun . Much has been done and much more is under way , both in spirit . and in specific achievement . It has not been easy ; change is never easy . But I believe the tide of physical and spiritual decay has been turned . " And near the end , he said : " Finally I want to make this statement of purpose : I believe we can end bigotry and discrimination . I believe we can bring safety to our neighborhoods and harmony to our city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty . I believe all of us can live together in mutual respect . "
