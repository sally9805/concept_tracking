" President Kennedy , a man who has suffered both illness and serious injury , enters the White House in the knowledge that his health is excellent and his medical future bright . " Thus last week reported the American Medical Association magazine , Today 's Health , in a detailed medical history of the incoming President . <P> Kennedy 's 1960 chart shows a couple of colds , a touch of laryngitis and a short-lived bout with sinusitis . At 43 , he is a trim , tanned 6 ft. , although a recent gain of 10 Ibs. ( to 175 ) showed in his plump cheeks . His blood pressure is a normal 112/80 . But he has had a troubled medical past . <P> Rammed &; Sunk . At 13 , Jack Kennedy dropped out of Connecticut 's Canterbury School with acute appendicitis . Recurring jaundice later forced his withdrawal from the London School of Economics and Princeton . Playing junior-varsity football at Harvard , he injured his spine , and in the Pacific , during World War II , he picked up malaria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese destroyer Amagri , Kennedy was flung violently to the deck , and his old back injury was aggravated , causing spinal muscle spasms and sciatica . <P> A 1944 operation at Chelsea ( Mass . ) Naval Hospital relieved the spasms , but Kennedy then found that his left leg was a quarter-inch shorter than his right , and the resulting seesaw effect tended increasingly to bring the spasms back . By 1954 he was a cripple on crutches . He hobbled into New York 's Hospital for Special Surgery . Doctors tried a delicate spinal fusion . It failed , and Kennedy contracted a near-fatal staphylococcus infection . Another operation four months later was successful , and novocain treatments broke the cycle of muscle spasms . The President still must wear a quarter-inch riser in the heel of his left shoes and sneakers , and a small brace to support his back muscles . <P> Campaign Issue . Even as his back pains troubled him early in the ' 50s , Kennedy was suffering from another disease that later became a campaign issue . Last July , aides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , charged that Senator Kennedy was a victim of Addison 's disease . As described by Dr. Thomas Addison in 1849 , that disease is a rare , acute adrenal tuberculosis ( signs : extreme lethargy , deep skin pigmentation ) that generally ends in death . Doctors nowadays often apply the name to nontubercular , nonfatal adrenal insufficiency . That , Kennedy 's doctors say , is what he has , and until several years ago he took desoxycorticosterone and cortisone to make up the lack . He still takes other corticosteroids by mouth , although his last tests showed his adrenal function to be normal . <P> The doctors ' latest report to Kennedy says : " Your health is excellent . Your vitality , endurance and resistance to infection are above average . Your ability to handle an exhausting work load is unquestionably superior . "
