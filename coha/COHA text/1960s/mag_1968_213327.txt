As modern medical technology has made the definition and determination of death increasingly complex , the transplant era has made both problems increasingly urgent . Virtually every physician and surgeon in the world wants to have his say . When the World Medical Association met in Sydney last week , 212 members from 28 nations debated the issues . They eventually adopted a tentative guideline document , the Declaration of Sydney , subject to detailed reconsideration next year . Simultaneously , a committee of 13 top-ranking Harvard professors proclaimed their code in the Journal of the A.M.A. <P> The documents were remarkably similar . Although the Sydney assembly could not agree on a precise definition of death , there is now a virtually worldwide consensus on the following criteria for establishing that irreversible coma , or death , has indeed occurred : <P> 1 ) Total lack of response to external stimuli , even the most painful that can ethically be applied . <P> 2 ) Absence of all spontaneous muscular movements , notably breathing . If the patient is on a mechanical respirator , this may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is incapable of breathing for himself . <P> 3 ) Absence of reflexes . The dilated pupils must not contract when a bright light is shone directly into them . There must be no eye movements in response to pouring ice water into the ears , no muscular contractions after hammer-tapping the tendons of the biceps , triceps or quadriceps . <P> 4 ) Flat encephalogram or absence of " brain waves . " <P> Significantly , the heart received least attention from the thanatologists . Both the difficulty and the urgency of their task resulted largely from the fact that a heart-lung machine can keep major parts of a body " alive " long after effective death . The long-held notion that death can be pinpointed in time , four or five minutes after heart action and breathing have stopped , is erroneous , said Cleveland 's Dr. Charles L. Hudson , principal U.S. delegate in Sydney . <P> " Death , " Hudson said , " is a gradual process at the cellular level , with tissues varying in their ability to withstand deprivation of oxygen . Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated cells but in the fate of a person . Here the point of death is not so important as the certainty that the process has become irreversible . " <P> No Murders . It was this point of irreversibility that most concerned the Harvard committee . Under the chairmanship of Dr. Henry K. Beecher , it outlined a series of technical steps to ensure that any flat EEG is really an accurate recording , then added that the tests " shall be repeated at least 24 hours later with no change . " On its face , this language appeared to rule out the prompt transplantation of an accident victim 's heart , but the committee felt that it was necessary to cover a few special cases . A victim of barbiturate poisoning may recover full brain function after 24 hours , or even longer , in deep coma . But in cases of massive head wounds , said Neurosurgeon William Sweet , a member of the committee , the brain damage would be the dominant consideration . Then the physician might decide , long before 24 hours had elapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
