Seldom has a football team changed as much between seasons as the Houston Oilers . Last year they were small , disgruntled , inept and last in the Eastern Division . This year they are big , happy , talented and could very well be first . The change began in January when Oiler Owner Bud Adams hired Don Klosterman away from the Kansas City Chiefs to become his general manager . Since then Klosterman has survived more than his share of ordeals  --  the Ladd-Faison mess , the firing of Coach Bones Taylor , the scuffle between Adams and a reporter , the John Brodie wrangle , to name a few  --  but he has reorganized the Oilers and has helped to put the team into a challenging position . Now it is up to new Coach Wally Lemm , new talent ( primarily Ernie Ladd ) and the new attitude to put the Oilers into their first AFL championship game since 1962. // " One thing I have learned this year is that loyalty is not just a word , " says Oiler Flanker Charley Hennigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dissatisfied with his job . " We have loyalty on this club now , and we all want to win . I could n't have said that before . " Loyalty , of course , will carry a team only so far . Then size , speed and ability must take over . // In the matter of size there is a tremendous difference at one of the most important places . Ladd , who is 6 feet 9 and weighs 315 , has moved in at right tackle after a long and involved trade from San Diego . " By himself , Ladd makes Houston 50% better on defense , " says one AFL coach . Ladd automatically gives Houston a vastly improved pass rush and stops a favorite ploy of Oiler opponents , which is running up the middle . In the past the Oilers had a defensive line that was small for professional football and was vulnerable to bigger teams that ran straight at them . This year Houston not only has Ladd but has added Pat Holmes , 6 feet 5 and 270 pounds , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulk and quickness in front of him , Middle Linebacker Doug Cline becomes much more effective . Cline 's backup man , Ronnie Caveness , is very quick and will find his 220-pound weight no handicap behind Ladd and Holmes . Scott Appleton , a regular last year , has become a swing tackle able to replace either Ladd or Holmes , increasing the Oilers ' depth . With Don Floyd at right end and Gary Cutsinger on the left , and with 275-pound Jim Hayes able to play either place , the Oiler defensive line has changed in a few months from one of the league 's feeblest to one of its toughest . // The linebacking is good , with Johnny Baker on the left and Danny Brabham on the right , but in the secondary the Oilers are worried about left corner back . Tony Banfield had an off year last season after knee surgery and though he was All-AFL in 1962 , he has been dropped . // Lemm , who coached the Oilers to an AFL championship in 1961 before moving to the St. Louis Cardinals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The main problems are finding consistency at center and depth in the interior line . John Frongillo , who has a long record of injuries , and the veteran John Wittenborn will try to handle the snapbacks and the chore of finding blitzing linebackers . First-unit Guards Sonny Bishop and Bob Talamini are good pass blockers . Rookie George Rice , the No. 3 draft choice and also a possibility at defensive tackle , will play behind them . The first-unit tackles are veterans Rich Michael and Walt Suggs , but they could be pressed by a pair of promising rookies , Glen Ray Hines and George Allen . By midseason that crowd of rookies may show Lemm he has the bench he wants . It may take that long for the Oilers to perfect their timing , because Lemm looked at more than 100 candidates . // Tight End Willie Frazier has been traded , but there will not be much of a drop in ability with Bob McLeod , a good receiver , moving in . The spread end , Charlie Frazier , has been one of the pleasantest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before last spring but now is enthusiastic about his speed and moves . Lawrence Elkins missed last season because of a knee injury and is ranked No. 2 behind Frazier at end and behind Hennigan at flanker . // The running-back position is one that Lemm can hardly help gloating over . He has two excellent men in Sid Blanks and Ode Burrell . Blanks , who had a sensational rookie year in 1964 , missed all of last season because of a knee injury . He is running sharply again this autumn . Burrell is small ( 185 ) , but he runs inside the tackles like a much larger man and has the speed to turn the end . He was Houston 's leading ground-gainer in 1965. // The Oilers went through their preseason schedule with four fullbacks  --  Donnie Stone , Charlie Tolar , John Henry Johnson and Hoyle Granger . Stone has played with Denver and Buffalo and is dependable and durable . Tolar has been the Oiler fullback since the club was organized . Johnson , the NFL veteran , signed with Houston for one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a rookie . Granger , a 227-pound rookie , was being groomed for next season , but somebody had to go , and it was Granger. // Lemm may also have trouble deciding which of his quarterbacks to use . He has veteran George Blanda ( also valuable as a place kicker ) , third-year man Don Trull and six-year veteran Jacky Lee , just back from a weird loan to Denver . " Blanda has the experience , " says Lemm . " Trull is pretty cool and can throw deep better than I had thought he could . Lee has a very strong arm . " After a few bad seasons the 38-year-old Blanda has become caught up in the new attitude of the Oilers . He is thinner and more congenial , looks younger and has been working hard . Lemm probably will decide to stay with Blanda at quarterback but keep the others warming up . That system has worked before . For the new Oilers , it could bring a division championship .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
