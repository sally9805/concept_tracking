Do you think about buildings ? You live and work in them , but do you ever really think about them ? New ones are piling up all around you . Did it ever occur to you that they might be killing the city by overcrowding ? Do you try to judge buildings , wondering why some are good and others bad ? Does one structure delight you and another depress you as just one more faceless faade , adding up to more monotony , more soul-destroying boredom ? Architecture has always been the mirror image of a civilization , expressing its needs , its priorities , its aspirations . How do you like what you 're getting ? Do you react ? Do you care ? <P> <P> WHO poses these questions ? Concerned architects , builders and planners do , and one of them presses the points with special urgency . He is Nathaniel Alexander Owings , a latter-day Jeremiah who is also a devout optimist , and who is the senior partner in America 's most forceful and prestigious architectural firm . At 65 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in S.O.M.-Skidmore , Owings &; Merrill . <P> He oversees a nationwide enterprise with offices in Chicago , New York City , San Francisco , Portland , Ore. , and Washington , D.C. In his long career he has presided over more than $3 billion worth of construction . It began with the beaver board exuberance of the 1933 Chicago World 's Fair . It led on to some of the largest and handsomest corporate structures anywhere , ranging from Manhattan 's Lever House to San Francisco 's Crown Zellerbach building . It raised Owings to national prominence as head of the presidential commission to replan the capital 's Pennsylvania Avenue . Above all , Owings is engaged , along with many others , in a major effort to impose some direction , order and esthetic responsibility on the chaotic growth of building in America . <P> Convulsive Surge . The U.S. remains in the grip of the greatest construction boom in history , and the topping off is not in sight . Since World War II , building has become the nation 's second largest industry ( food production is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gross national product , created new structures valued at $1 trillion-and that 's a 13-figure number . In the past decade , Houston , for instance , has packed 17 major new structures into a 20-square-block area . Los Angeles has overcome its earthquake fears and built 107 high-rise office buildings . Denver has put up one new office building per year , while Manhattan boasts no fewer than 135 new office structures . <P> <P> Statistics can not express the convulsive reality . The American metropolis seems constantly to be tearing itself down and building itself up again . The din and confusion of building has become a built-in part of the city 's confusion . Everywhere old towers crumble , excavations appear , followed by the quick climb of high steel skeletons . They rise straight from the busy city streets , the clusters of trucks , cement mixers and cranes hopelessly aggravating the snarl of traffic . Amid all this there arise new questions about the price of progress .                  @ @ @
