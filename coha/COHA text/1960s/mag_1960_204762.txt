Barnstorming through Nevada last February , Presidential Hopeful Jack Kennedy dropped word at a press conference that it would sure be fine to have a Western Governor as a running mate . Nevada 's Governor Grant Sawyer soon got the word . Sawyer 's friends mentally crossed off those Westerners who plainly had no chance-California 's Pat Brown ( like Kennedy , a Roman Catholic ) , Washington 's Albert Rosellini ( Catholic ) , Oregon 's Mark Hatfield ( Republican ) - and came to the logical conclusion that Kennedy certainly must have been talking about Grant Sawyer . As the Sawyer pride swelled , so did his admiration of and enthusiasm for Kennedy . <P> In Kansas last March , Kennedy told reporters that Governor George Docking stood " near the top " of any list of vice-presidential choices , and Kennedy pointedly declined to name any others who were as " outstanding " as the Kansan . Docking is still neutral , but he has a warm spot in his heart for Kennedy . <P> In Michigan for months , Kennedy and his front men have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's top Democrats : Kennedy would like to balance his ticket with a Midwestern Governor whose record of liberalism can be counted on to woo the votes of labor , farmers , Negroes , minority groups . To Michigan Democrats this can only mean their outgoing , job-hunting Governor G. Mennen ( " Soapy " ) Williams . <P> Subtly . Kennedy and his aides have planted the hope of the vice-presidency in the bosom of many a man who will be controlling votes at the Democratic Convention . Usual procedure is for Kennedy or an aide-often Brother Bob or Ted-to huddle with a hopeful and then analyze the situation . The analysis is penetrating , and the conclusion , though unspoken , is inescapable : the listener has just the right qualities , and , what is more , Jack likes him . Since almost any respectable , non-Irish , non-Eastern non-Catholic has the basic qualities , the field is extensive . <P> The same " liberal Midwestern Governor " message that Kennedy men slipped to Soapy Williams has reached Iowa 's Governor Herschel Cellel Loveless , and Minnesota 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farther West , Kennedy 's braintrusters have spread news that they are also considering Washington 's Senator Henry ( " Scoop " ) Jackson , New Mexico 's Senator Clinton Anderson , California 's Senator Clair Engle , and even Arizona 's Congressman Stewart Udall . South of the Mason-Dixon line , their only live entry has been Florida 's Governor Leroy Collins . <P> The vice-presidential gambit is as old as presidential politics , and even the gullible know in their political hearts that no real promises have been made . With the smell of victory in the air , the Kennedy forces are ready to make that more than clear . " The field is wide open , " said a top Kennedy lieutenant last week . " The wider open it is , the better it is for Kennedy . " Everybody but Harry Truman is eligible .
