God is about to destroy Southern California for its sinfulness . Driven by this conviction , nearly 600 members of half a dozen pentecostal churches in the Golden State are pulling up stakes and getting out before the holocaust . <P> The inspiration for the exodus comes from the Rev. Donald Abernathy of the Apostolic Gospel Church of Bell Gardens , a Los Angeles suburb . Last spring he had a series of visions that convinced him that the Los Angeles area would soon be torn apart by an earthquake . In his graphic revelations , Abernathy said , " buildings crumbled , freeways buckled , water gushed up from cracks in the ground and volcanoes erupted in the nearby mountains . Then the destruction moved north toward San Francisco . " In two subsequent visions , Abernathy saw an airplane ticket stamped with the word " Atlanta . " Taking this as divine direction , he led 180 members of his congregation on a migration to Atlanta last month . They traveled not by airplane , however , but in cars with trailers . <P> Before leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congregations . Most of them , too , have decided to move . Last month more than 100 members of a church in Avenal , 50 miles southwest of Fresno , emigrated to Kennett , Mo . A 50-member congregation in Porterville transferred to Independence , Mo . One hundred members of a church in Lompoc also trekked to Georgia . The Rev. Robert Theobold , pastor of the Friendly Bible Apostolic Church at Port Hueneme , plans to resettle his congregation of 90 men , women and children in Murfreesboro , Tenn . Theobold , who claims to have received mystical confirmation of Abernathy 's vision , believes that the earthquakes " will leave Southern California like Sodom and Gomorrah before the end of 1970 . " Theobold says that his flock will leave before Oct. 12 , " the deadline given me by God for departure . " <P> While there are personal hardships involved , members of the emigrating churches are convinced that they are obeying God 's will in leaving their homes and jobs . They also believe that Southern California has only itself to blame for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of wickedness here : Hollywood , big business , prosperity , homosexuality , topless places . " If the horrible event happens , seismologists will not be surprised . They have repeatedly warned that , because of the stresses along the San Andreas fault extending through the state , California is overdue for a disastrous earthquake .
