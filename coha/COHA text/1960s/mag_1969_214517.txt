IN any Western country with a heritage of Judaeo-Christian ethics , the regulation of abortion is an immensely complex problem in which the basic medical factors are obscured by religious , moral and emotional considerations . Great Britain is now learning the lesson of history in a most unfortunate way . A new law permitting abortion under certain circumstances was passed less than a year ago as a humane effort to treat the matter as an essentially medical issue between patient and doctor . Although the new law has proved helpful to British women , it has swamped physicians and produced some socially divisive results . It has also turned London into the abortion capital of the Western world . <P> Great Britain 's historical opposition to abortion comes from both common and canon law . In 1803 Lord Ellenborough pushed through a bill to make abortion a crime punishable by death if performed after the fetus had " quickened . " In 1837 Parliament revised the law , eliminating the death penalty , but in the process lost the distinction between abortion before and after quickening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal except to save the life of the pregnant woman . <P> Legal Challenge . To Obstetrician Aleck William Bourne ( now retired but a hale 82 ) , this strict regulation seemed outrageous . In 1938 he performed an abortion on a 14-year-old girl , who had been gang-raped by horse guardsmen , then invited the Attorney General of England to prosecute him . After 40 minutes ' deliberation , the jury acquitted Bourne-and the " Bourne rule " stood for 30 years . Its effect was to make abortion available to any Englishwoman who was articulate and well-off enough to persuade doctors to certify , by a liberal interpretation of the law , that continuation of her pregnancy would endanger her life . Inevitably , there were uncounted and uncountable illegal , back-street abortions for the less privileged , with the danger of serious illness or death from infection or plain butchery . <P> Agitation in Britain for liberalization resulted in bitter debates in both houses of Parliament in 1966 and 1967 . The debate culminated last year in the passage of an act that permitted a registered physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other physician concurred in his judgment , on any one of three conditions : <P> 1 ) that continuation of the pregnancy would involve greater risk to the life of the woman than if pregnancy ended ; <P> 2 ) that its continuation would involve greater risk of injury to the physical or mental health of the woman or of any existing children of her family ; <P> 3 ) that there would be " substantial risk " that the child would suffer from such physical or mental disabilities as to be seriously handicapped . <P> Import Trade . The permissiveness of the law was intended to be its virtue , but it has proved to be a fault . Because the law imposes no residence requirement , the " miscarriage trade " that used to flow from Britain to Poland and Yugoslavia has been reversed . Now wealthy Americans , Canadians and Europeans , as well as women even from countries with such liberal abortion laws as Denmark 's , are homing in on London . There , they can get abortions quickly and safely in private hospitals or nursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P>
