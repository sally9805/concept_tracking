txt Transportation problems and the delicate issue of sovereignty are preventing a relief effort by international agencies that are trying to arrest widespread starvation in Biafra , the secessionist former Eastern Region of Nigeria . Relief experts fear that more than a million people will die before the end of August unless Biafra receives 20 times the amount of aid now getting through by air . This is the latest assessment by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross ; the World Council of Churches ; the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief , the British-based relief organization , and Caritas , the international Roman Catholic . charity organization . Representatives of these agencies have been meeting here in Biafra to try to arrange transportation of thousands of tons of protein-rich food . The federal Nigerian Government in Lagos wants all relief channeled through federal hands . The view here is that the federal Government fears that any sanction of relief shipments direct to Biafra from neutral territory would bolster the secessionist region 's claim to sovereignty . Biafrans have rejected aid by way of Nigeria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisoned , partly to avoid any act that would show a dependence on the Nigerian Government . The eastern region announced on May 30 , 1967 , that it had seceded from Nigeria . Civil war broke out on July 7 . Biafra has fared poorly in the war , and has lost Enugu , the capital , and other major cities , to federal forces . Biafrans Cite Blockade Biafrans charge that importing of food is threatened by a Nigerian naval blockade and the presence of federal planes , piloted by Egyptians , that prevent daylight flights into the territory . Gabriel Ijewere , counselor of the Nigerian Embassy in Washington , denied that his country 's air force or a naval blockade were being used to prevent the importation of food and other supplies by Biafra . The handful of planes in the Biafran airlift are limited to night flights from nearby Portuguese and Spanish islands in the Gulf of Guinea . The poor cargo-handling capacity at Biafra 's only remaining airport , the location of which is secret , now limits the amount of food that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying two nightly shuttles . The result is a logistical bottleneck preventing hundreds of tons of food from reaching Biafra . By July 12 , ships with 1,700 tons of pow-1 dered milk and dried fish will have unloaded at the nearby Spanish island of Fernando Po . But it will take nearly six weeks before the shipment finally reaches Biafra by air at the rate of 40 tons a night . Dr. Herman Middelkoop , a 45-year-old Dutch rural health specialist who represents the World Council of Churches here , said : " Our present goal , 40 tons a night , will only postpone the death of a few people . It is like giving a drip feed to a person with a stroke . " Several million people are likely to be dead by the end of August and I have no doubt that even six million people will die in the next six months without a cease-fire and massive help . " The Swiss representative of the Red Cross in Biafra , Henri Jaggi , said : " Either we sit still and watch while six million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease-fire . " A two-week tour through refugee camps , hospitals and villages in Biafra showed the extent of the tragedy everywhere . At Queen Elizabeth Hospital here in Umuahia , Biafras administrative capital a small medical team attempts to treat thousands of refugees and villagers every day . In the team are John Paterson , 67 years old , an agricultural expert sent by the Church of Scotland , Dr. Ann Jackson , 31 , also sent by the Church of Scotland , who runs the children 's ward at Queen Elizabeth ; Sister Brechtje Folkerts , 35 , of the Dutch Reformed Church , and several Biafran nurses . Last week , more than 400 mothers and children were waiting for the medical team at Umuagu , six miles north of here . The group was able to give only one cup of powdered milk to about a third of the children . This was to last two weeks , until the next visit . Most of the children had the obvious signs of kwashiorkor , or severe protein starvation , including golden-colored hair , swollen ankles and legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak to lift their heads . The weary Dr. Jackson told many of the mothers : " You 're too late . " Most of these children will die within the next few weeks , " she said . " We have only 30 beds for children at the hospital . I ca n't handle any of them from here . Another month , and half the people here will be dead . " " All my life I have been seing a little of this , but now it is an extreme beyond words , " said Mr. Paterson , who has been working in the area for 44 years . At Umuawa-Ude , a mile away , children greeted the medical team clutching empty cardboard boxes that had contained a German protein preparation given to them two weeks ago . The team had one large pail of food left , and several hundred children pushed around it to get one husk of corn each . Many mothers on the outskirts of the crowd pleaded with the visitor to push a path ahead for them , as they were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , a large crowd of children had not received anything . They pressed around a relief worker as he threw out the last kernels . The children scrambled on the ground for the remains . One emaciated girl picked powdered milk off the smock of her younger sister . Two elderly women collapsed and , as the children walked away from the empty pail , the lifted their hands and begged . In Umuahia , Mr. Jaggi showed the records of an appeal the Red Cross had made to all national Red Cross societies at the end of April . As of the middle of June , 19 national societies had responded . The contribution of the British Red Cross was $2,350 . The American Red Cross had not responded , he said . At a meeting here last week , representatives of the international agencies in Biafra weighed the cost of ships , air charters and food to provide 1,100 tons of aid per day for the almost 63 million people in Biafra . The total cost was put at $19.2-million a month . So far , several hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Catholic and Protestant churches , and the Oxford Committee . Blocking of Aid Denied Gabriel Ijewere , counselor of the Nigerian Embassy in Washington , denied yesterday that his country 's air force or a naval blockade was being used to prevent the importation of food and other supplies by Biafra . He asserted that the federal Government of Nigeria had " given permission for food , medical supplies and other relief items to be sent to rebelheld areas , but there are no airports large enough in the rebel-held area and they have no seaport . " The counselor also said that the federal Government had agreed to have relief supplies sent to federal-held towns for transport to rebel-held places , but that rebel leaders had rejected this . Mr. Ijewere suggested that rebel leaders were more interested in getting arms than food and medical supplies . In this connection , a letter to The New York Times from Timothy Adebanjo , the ' Nigerian Embassy 's First Secretary , declared : " Unfortunately , the rebels seem to be concentrating on propaganda which they think would mobilize world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the rebels might be allowed to fly in supplies of their own from Europe and to use this opportunity to bring in large quantities of arms that would only prolong the conflict and result in even , more suffering for the people whose interests they claim to espouse . " On the other hand , the Biafran Ministry of Information , in a statement issued in New York at 342 Madison Avenue , declared that " Biafra faces the worst refugee problem in living memory . " The statement said : " It is an astronomical human , problem , a tragedy to the con ? i tinent of Africa and a challenge to all lovers of humanity . In all , there are five million displaced persons In Biafra . In other words , one out of every three persons in Biafra is a refugee  --  a thing unheard of in the history of any other nation in the world . Of this number , one million ? mostly destitute women and children and the sick  --  live in refugee camps under difficult conditions . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
