No spotlights swept the sky when it happened . No vinyl microskirted star lets babbled by ; no gawkers gathered under a spangled marquee . Yet the event was as important as any premiere in Hollywood history . On the day in 1966 when Jack Warner sold his studio to the parvenu Seven Arts Productions , a new movie epoch began . <P> Warner was the last of the old-style movie moguls - the wily pioneers like Goldwyn , Mayer and Cohn - who ruled their lots like caliphs , buying stars like steers , firing directors as easily as office boys , and selecting scripts by gut instinct . And the power vacuum they left behind is being filled by men with polished fingernails and vocabularies to match . The arrival of the newcomers may not guarantee a Celluloid City renaissance . But it has already generated a measurable optimism . <P> The major Hollywood production centers are purring with some 150 feature films scheduled for 1968 . Budgets are bigger than ever , now that the vast conglomerate industries have moved in and allowed the studios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tween the new financiers and the new film makers , studios are turning to the new executives . Cool , crisp as a bank note , three such men , none of them yet 40 , are already the masters of production at some of the nation 's biggest and best-known studios : <P> 20th Century-Fox now takes orders from Richard Zanuck , 33 , executive vice president in charge of production . A tough , laconic demon for physical fitness ( he does 50 push-ups a day before starting work ) , Darryl Zanuck 's only son sometimes talks like one of the old-time tyrants . " I 'll practically do anything short of murder to achieve what I want , " he says . After graduating from Stanford and serving as an Army lieutenant , he got his first film job as production assistant on his father 's 1957 version of The Sun Also Rises . In 1962 , Darryl Zanuck , after taking charge of Fox , put his son then 27-in charge of production . Cynical studio executives snickered about the son still rising . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood has a phone with a hot line to Dad in New York , his sometime critics grudgingly concede that the kid with the sulphurous temper has something-and besides he is n't a kid any more . Since the financial success of The Sound of Music- a Dick Zanuck product all the way-Fox has moved steadily from post-Cleopatra losses to $15,420,000 in net profits in 1967 . Listed for production are such ambitious projects as : Hello , Dolly ! ; Lawrence Durrell 's Alexandria Quartet ; Staircase , a comedy about two aging homosexuals ; The Great White Hope , a corrosive drama of Negro prejudice .
