Royal Lytham and St. Anne 's , the site of the 103rd British Open , is a lean and dour golf links whose fairways thread their narrow green way between the shallow coastal sand dunes that mark the countryside of Lancashire in northern England . There last week a pair of much glorified Americans ran into some inglorious difficulties , a playoff developed between two of the most dissimilar people ever to confront each other face to face in any sport , and the new champion turned out to be a man whose looks and personality matched the golf course itself , lean and dour Bob Charles of New Zealand . // When he defeated California 's plump , bumptious Phil Rodgers by eight strokes in the 36-hole playoff , Charles became the first left-handed golfer ever to win such a major tournament . He thus heartened lefties everywhere who are perpetually uneasy because the world thinks they do things wrong-way-round , and in a different way he heartened all Britannia , for he is the very model of a modern British champion . // Judged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. , British tournament golf seems as out of date as gaslight , but the British like to see the game they founded played their way . Dignity from the players , please . No hat throwing . No shouting . No dancing , no prancing . Just plain , unalloyed golf . Cool as the North Sea and slim as a two-iron , Bob Charles could hardly fit this mold more perfectly . Nor could his playoff challenger have been better cast to give what TV-oriented fans in the U.S. have come to look upon as a vital ingredient of tournament golf : showmanship . When things are going well for Phil Rodgers , he is a waltzing , wisecracking Jackie Gleason of golf . When they are not , he mopes and lets the world mope with him . When he sinks a putt he will shout , clap his hands or march around like a drum major . When he misses he is a Hamlet beset . // " A lot of the time , " says Rodgers , " I even take myself by surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good chip , and before T knew I was doing it I found myself screaming , ' Get in the hole , get in the hole . ' " // His stunting seemed to strike the British galleries , trained as they are in the stiff-upper-lip approach to sport , as refreshing . But when they laughed , as often as not it came out as a nervous giggle of embarrassment rather than as a hearty guffaw of pleasure . // They knew how to react to Charles . Somber as an Alp and hardly more talkative , he showed his followers the kind of implacable golf and unchangeable mien that the British had not seen since Ben Hogan won their Open by four strokes in 1953 . They had called Hogan the " Wee Ice Mon " and loved him as one of their own . Now here came Charles , who really was one of their own , assuming one is willing to take the British view that New Zealand is as much a part of the homeland as Piccadilly . // Nor was it any freak happenstance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of famed Americans and then slice Rodgers to shreds in a playoff . By far the finest left-handed golfer ever , he had won the Houston Classic in April , had earned $20,000 on the U.S. pro tour this year ( SI , May 23 ) and had the kind of straight , unforced game that was well suited to Royal Lytham and its narrow fairways. // The playoff became a necessity when both Rodgers and Charles finished with 3-under-par 277s on Friday , thanks to pars on the last hole . Rodgers crouched over a 15-foot birdie putt on the final hole of the 36 played that day , needing only to sink it to win the championship . He then hit such a weak , nervous putt that it stopped two feet short . With that he laughed  --  somewhat shakily , of course . After barely curling in the second putt , he dropped his tweed cap over the hole and rubber-legged his way , vaudeville style , off the green . Charles , who had been partnered with Rodgers , was somewhat shocked at all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then stepped forward and rammed in his own four-foot putt to preserve the tie . // In the 36-hole playoff the next day , while his demonstrative opponent was either clapping happily or kicking his putter in anguish , depending on the situation , Charles was calmly one-putting 12 of the first 20 greens to build a seemingly insurmountable margin of five shots . But his lead shrank to one stroke when he hooked a drive out of bounds and Rodgers sank some putts of his own . Then on the 8th hole of the afternoon round , Charles broke Rodgers ' last challenge . First , Rodgers rolled in a downhill 50-foot birdie putt and cake-walked ecstatically around the green . Amazingly , Charles stroked in a 30-foot birdie putt of his own . With no more than a flicker of a smile on his face he turned and walked off to the next tee , leaving his caddie to retrieve the ball and Rodgers to try to retrieve his shaken spirit . The caddie got the ball , but Rodgers never got back his composure . While Phil fumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He won the gallery over with his efficient dignity , and he won the playoff 140 to 148. // By winning , Charles not only bested an unusually strong field  --  Arnold Palmer was trying for his third British Open in a row , Peter Thomson his fifth championship , Gary Player and Kel Nagle their second , Jack Nicklaus and Doug Sanders their first  --  but an extremely tight and trying course . The rough was worse than at the U.S. Open in Brook-line , the fairways were heavily sprinkled with deep , tiny bunkers , and the greens were small and hard , requiring that approach shots land short and bounce toward the hole . // Beyond all this , the course presented a truly unique difficulty : the British railway system . All day long small , black steam engines puffed by , going to and from the sprawling resort town of Blackpool , some six miles north along the Irish Sea . " The railroad trains are simply one of the hazards a player must learn to overcome at Royal Lytham , " declared Charles Lawrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mischievous smile directed toward American visitors hardly accustomed to mixing locomotives with their golf . // Lawrie 's statement could only bring an emphatic nod of agreement from near-winner Jack Nicklaus . During the second round , while working hard for a par out of the rough on the left of the 8th hole , he started to hit an approach shot . Just then a steam engine the size of a trolley , but pulling a dozen coal cars and a battered caboose , huffed and clanked its way out of the Ansdell-Fairhaven station behind the 8th green . As Nicklaus was about to settle back into his stance again , the engineer reached up and produced two deafening toots on the engine 's steam whistle . It was his statement of independence of a game that seemed to exhaust so much energy with such little result . // Later in the tournament this unusual hazard intervened once more . Leading by two shots with only two holes to go in the last round , Nicklaus was in deep grass on a mound behind the 17th green preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the 16th fairway Charles and Rodgers , now tied for second , waited and watched . As Jack stood over the ball , glowering at the hole , a commuter train whistled shrilly . Jack waited until the train had passed , then fluffed his pitch and took a bogey 5. // The silent treatment // While the trains presented one problem , the almost deathly quiet of Royal Lytham 's galleries produced another . During last year 's British Open at Troon in Scotland , the crowd had broken loose and run wildly over the course , surging around Palmer and shouting loudly . This year the spectators , who totaled 20,000 for the entire tournament , trooped around the course like mourners at a funeral . Fine approach shots were greeted with only light hand clapping , sizable birdie putts with slightly heavier applause , and short birdie putts , very often , with almost no noise at all . // " Those Scots tend to get a little too excited , " explained a Royal Lytham marshal lounging by the side of the 14th fairway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of yelling . When a player hears some firm clapping he knows he has hit a good , crisp shot . " // This English restraint , combined with the almost total lack of scoreboards around the course , made it difficult for the players , especially during the critical closing moments of the tournament , to figure out who was doing what , where . Charles and Rodgers , playing together , could , of course , keep track of each other , but Nicklaus , two groups ahead , might as well have been playing in France . // After he had bogeyed the 71st ( or 17th ) hole to lose one stroke of his lead , Nicklaus waited on the 72nd tee to try to determine what his closest pursuers had done on the 70th . " I wanted to know what I needed , " he said later . " When I knew they must have played out the 16th and I still had not heard a sound from down there I figured they must have passed the hole without a birdie and that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodgers and Charles had birdied 16 . When Nicklaus bogeyed 18 and the other two parred in he was beaten . // Arnold Palmer 's failure  --  he finished 26th  --  was a real shock to British golf fans , who have made him something of a national hero . As the Open began , the odds on Palmer were 2 to 1 , absurdly low for any professional golf event . // " Arnold is such an engaging person , " said Pat Ward-Thomas of The Guardian , one of Great Britain 's most authoritative sportswriters . " He is so expressive and so capable of astounding things on a golf course ; a combination of warmth and great talent that we do n't see over here too much . " It was that kind of feeling that was reflected in the betting . // Palmer certainly felt the support that welled from his large galleries , but he did not respond with his customary flair . // " I could feel them moaning and groaning while I was moaning and groaning , but I just could n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you are not sure why . " // Thus in the end the U.S. hopes were left to Rodgers , whose 67-68-73-69 represented the best golf he had played in months . Tied for the lead or ahead throughout the first two days , he seemed ready to win his first big title when Charles came from five strokes back with a brilliant third-round 66 and the coolness to force the playoff. // " I really have to offer my condolences to Phil , " said Charles at the presentation ceremony . " I think I just demoralized him with my putter . I hate to think how many putts I sank . It is a shame we ca n't be joint holders of the trophy . " Demoralize is a fair word for what he did to Rodgers . So is slaughter . // " People are going to like Charles over here , " said three-time British Open Champion Henry Cotton after it was all over . " He plays golf in the British manner . No clowning , no exuberant gestures , no exorbitant facial expressions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself , like Hogan , just by the efficient way he plays . " // To left-handers , at least , he has already made a hero of himself .
