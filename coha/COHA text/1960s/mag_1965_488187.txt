The abrupt announcement in mid-August that Singapore had been excluded from the Malaysian Federation and become , overnight , an independent state , left the world and its press in some confusion . It was far from clear at first whether this was secession , expulsion or mutually agreed withdrawal . It is now all too evident that it was , in fact , expulsion . Tunku Abdur Rahman , Prime Minister of Malaysia , came back from the Commonwealth Conference in London and simply told Mr. Lee Kuan Yew , Premier of Singapore , that his state must go . In subsequent explanations of this unilateral decision it was made plain that the real cause was the Tunku 's fear that if Singapore , pre-208 dominantly Chinese , remained in the federation , the extreme Malay nationalists could no longer be controlled and would press upon the Prime Minister policies leading swiftly to racial conflict between Chinese and Malays . The amputation of ' Singapore , it was hoped , would alleviate this pressure and deprive the extremists of their principal weapon  --  the constant denunciation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for acts of physical coercion against him and his supporters . Up to a point this aim was achieved . Data Syed Albar , leader of the extreme party , resigned in anger his ' post as secretary of the United Malay National Organization . ( UMNO ) , the Malay party in the government coalition , and bitterly denounced his leadet , the Tunku , for getting rid of his favor-ite whipping boy . A Malay of aristocratic descent , the Tunku perhaps comforts himself , with the reflection that Albar is not even a Malay , but a man of Arab ancestry born in the Celebes , who did not migrate to . Malaya till he was 30 . Lee Kuan Yew did not fail to bring these facts to public notice in a television interview , pointing out C. P. FitzGerald teaches Far Eastern history at Australian National University He is the author , most recently , of The Third ' China ( F. W. Cheshire , Ltd ) . His other works on the country where he lived for twenty-five years include China . A Short Cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the contrary , came from a family that had been settled in Singapore for more than a century . After the first recriminations , it has become clear that neither Malaysia nor Singapore wishes to pursue the quarrel to the bitter end . Singapore was promptly recognized as a sovereign state by Britain , the United States and other powers , but as yet by no means all the Afro-Asian states have followed suit . The attitude of , Indonesia , above all , remains ambivalent . The reaction in Singapore , which was one of , rejoicing , with firecracker celebrations in the streets when the news was made known , was at least in part inspired by the belief that independent Singapore could . escape from the quarrel with Indonesia ( which could henceforward be left to " Malaysia " ) and resume its profitable trade with ' Java , Sumatra and the outer islands . Mr. Lee soon showed that this was too simple an assessment of the new situation . He can not , under present circumstances , follow a foreign policy which Malaysia would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that Indonesia has ceased to make raids and clandestine attacks upon Singapore itself , hitherto a conspicuous feature of " confrontation . " But it may be assumed that Singapore will seek to appease the quarrel and use what influence it has to restore normal relations . Another question arising from the exclusion of Singapore is whether this event does not represent a victory for President Sukarno 's policy of " confrontation " and its aim , to " crush Malaysia . " Certainly the Indonesians have made this claim , arguing that the expulsion of Singapore proves their contention that Malaysia was an artificial creation of incongruous elements which should never have been associated , which were forcibly united only by the " neo-colonial imperialists " ( British , in this instance ) as an instrument of their nefarious policies . They predict , and expect , that the next break will come in Borneo , where the states of ' Sarawak and Sabah , also non-Malay , though not dominantly Chinese in population , will soon break away . That the Malays in Kuala Lumpur share this prediction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaimed its utter impossibility and from his October 11 , 1965 somewhat premature claim that any such talk was " treason . " It can truly be thought that the association of Sarawak and ' Sabah in Malaysia , originally designed to compensate for the inclusion of dominantly Chinese Singapore , has lost itspurpose . There was some eco- noMic link between Singapore and the Borneo lands ; there is almost none between peninsula Malaya and these countries . The chief remaining function of the federation for the Borneo states is to provide a political framework within which British and Australian military assistance can be provided to resist Indonesian infiltration . Britain is pledged to defend Malaysia against these attacks ; if Sarawak and Sabah were no longer part of Malaysia , this pledge might be rendered invalid , or at least would need to be reconsidered . Britain is pressed by financial problems and many influential people there would not be sorry to find a reason for getting out of this onerous commitment . On the other hand it is not at all clear that Indonesia does gain anything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of confrontation . Mr. Lee knows that Sukarno and his supporters regard the British naval base at Singapore as the chief bastion of the hated n , eo-colonialism in Southeast Asia ; he also knows that the base is of the , highest importance to the economy of Singapore ; it employs large numbers of citizens of the new state at good wages , brings in welcome money and stimulates commerce . Moreover , whatever the past ' sins of British imperialism , it is a fact that as long as the British are in the Singapore base the Indonesians can not hope to crush either Singapore or even peninsula Malaysia . Mr. Lee , in his television interview , reminded the public that the armed forces of the state of Singapore were but two battalions  --  one of which is in any case still in Borneo fighting Indonesian infiltration . He did , at the same time , gently remind the Western peoples that the population of his country , was as numerous as that of New Zealand . Singapore has no intention of becoming the pawn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its able leaders have any inclination to seek new alliances in other quarters . But the real cause of the ' rupture between Singapore and peninsula Malaya was not confrontation , but the underlying tension between Malays and Chinese which had built up for many years , but which was of no political significance as long as both peoples were equally under British colonial rule . Nineteenth-century laissez faire may have been good for business , but it was bad for future race relations . Malaya needed willing and industrious workers : the Malays were peasant farmers , or their aristo cratic masters . The Chinese were glad to come and work at running the village shop , tin mining , rubber planting , distribution , transport , banking , wharf labor and every other urban occupation . Thus was built up a race pattern wherein the Malays retained the land and lived mainly on it , the Chinese built up and inhabited the cities , dominating the economy , while the British reserved to themselves all real political power and the biggest of big business . With the withdrawal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sup-209 pressed , Malays and Chinese were left face to face . Singapore was at first not part of the new Federation of Malaya , lest its overwhelming Chinese population and ' economic importance should dominate , the new state . When it became clear that this separation was inconvenient and possibly dangerous , Malaysia was created with the addition of the Borneo states to balance the Chinese in Singapore . But the tensions were not eliminated by this political carpentry . The Chinese are not only in Singapore but , up to a 40 per cent minority , in peninsula Malaya also . They are there in great numbers in the cities , such as Kuala Lumpur , the capital ; Penang , the main port ; Ipoh and Taiping , ' the tin mining centers . They are politically represented by the Malayan Chinese Association , one of the two partners in the coalition government . But this party mainly represents the rich businessmen , the tin-mining millionaires and the tycoons of commerce . The poorer Chinese , the laborers and the urban petty bourgeois , had little influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being immigrants , although of long standing . After the formation of Malaysia , the Peoples Action Party of Singapore , Mr. Lee Kuan Yew 's party , started to operate in the peninsula states , and although at first it made slight headway , its avowed aim was to create a popular party which would challenge the coalition of Malay aristocracy ' and Chinese wealth whiCh comprised the federal government . The Chinese , by virtue of their occupations and their derivation from poor immigrants over the past century , are urban , progressive , a relatively classless society , the Malays are conservative , either aristocratic landowners or poor and often illiterate peasants . They have no tradition of , and little aptitude for , business , commerce or industry . Thus social as well as racial tension has undermined the new federation , and bids fair to continue as the chief problem of the peninsula after Singapore has been excluded . This situation was only marginally connected with Indonesian confrontation , and not at all with the problem of communism . The exclusion of Singapore promises very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , a temporary relaxation of political pressures . For Singapore it could mean much more . The aim of the Peoples Action Party , the government , is to create a truly multiracial society in the island . The party includes several prominent non-Chinese : Indians , Ceylonese and others of ' the numerous small minorities which settled under colonial rule in the prosperous port city . The Chinese are at least 80 per , cent of the population , so can not be challenged by any other group . Strength gives tolerance : it is not true that such communities retain all the characteristics of the nations from which their ancestors came . The ' Chinese are from many parts of south China , and speak several different dialects . They came from underprivileged families in a neglected , politically unimportant region of the old J-Chinese empire . They have , become prosperous and in many cases very wealthy in their new country . They look upon it as their home , while ' retaining a pride of race and traditional , attachment to the old country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples such as Australians and New Zealanders , long established in distant lands but still sharing the old culture and having many links with the old homeland . Indians tend to shed the more restrictive practices of caste once theysettle in Malaya or Singapore , and though MosleMs of Arab or Indian descent retain their religion , they are not identified with the Moslem Malays . Many Chinese , large numbers of south Indians , Eurasians , and others are Christian . Malaya , and in particular Singapore , has been a melting pot in which , although the various races have not fused to form a new people , they have rubbed off the sharp edges of their national cultures . It is for these reasons that Singapore has a better chance to evolve a truly equal-status , multiracial community than seems yet to be possible on the mainland . Such is the ideal which is followed , sometimes with insufficient tact , by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew . His trouble with the Malays of Kuala Lumpur arose principally from the single-mindedness with which he proclaimed the doctrine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others . A man of brilliant gifts , with an outstanding academic record in his own country and later at Cambridge , he has the handicap of being unable to suffer fools gladly ? or in silence . Several years ago , when still the leader of an unrecognized movement under the colonial regime , his mordant criticism and pungent comment on the ruling authorities won him their dislike and almost fear . They then used to comfort themselves with the belief that Lee Kuan Yew and his supporters were " men of straw " : ten years later the British in Singapore were very glad to see such solid bricks made from this straw , a wall which they recognized was the best , perhaps the only , sound defense against the progress of communism in the island city . Yet no one has up to now really contemplated the problems and the possible perils of an independent Singapore . It was denied this status when Malaya became fully independent , because it was feared that Singapore could not stand alone , and might succumb to Communist influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Action Party fully accepted this solution . It has now been rejected by the Malays , so abruptly , and with so little consultation among the other members of the British Commonwealth , that it is necessary to conclude that this was an act of impulse , a yielding to pressure . The question remains whether , since the deed is now done , the dangers of an independent Singapore are as fearful as they seemed to be a few years ago . Whether Singapore is viable economically is yet uncertain , but it probably is , if no unnatural restraint is put upon its trade and developing industry . The political stability of the new state may seem more in doubt , but the P.A.P . holds a commanding majority of the electorate , has to its credit great achievements in the field of housing and social welfare for the poor and working class , and has won the respect , if not always the affection , of the business community . But Singapore is more than a great commercial city and port of call ; it is also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the naval base , held under agreement by the British and also used by Australian forces in the region . In the view of military experts no other base could replace Singapore : if the British can not use this stronghold , they can not operate effectively in Southeast Asia . Neither Malaysia nor the Borneo states could be defended without Singapore . It is also more and more generally realized that a base in a country which feels hostility to the foreign power which uses the base is probably nearly useless . Cyprus showed this fact , and Aden now underlines it . Is independent Singapore going to be tolerant of the British in the base , or gradually grow hostile to its continuance ? There is no doubt that in Britain a large number of people feel that the burden of Eastern commitments is too heavy . There was a distinct tendency at the news of Singapore 's expulsion from Malaysia to suggest that the time had come to reconsider the whole problem and to contemplate withdrawal . Many politicians of all parties feel that it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of maintaining British forces in these distant countries when the people concerned seem at best indifferent to British interests , and frequently opposed to them . It is in this context that the remarks made by Lee Kuan Yew , so sharp in tone toward the United States , must be interpreted . Singapore , he said , would never permit the Americans to use the base . If the British went , then no other power , least of all October 11 , 1965 America , should have it He added a number of criticisms of American policy and attitudes in east Asia ; these may represent his feelings , but they also served to put him on the path of grace in the eyes of many of his Asian neighbors . It may be suggested , though , that this was the sauce : the meat was the threat directed against Britain 's disposition to cast off its burden ; if you go , we will not let you pass the responsibility , and the base , to America , so you had better understand that you must stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very good guarantee of Singapore 's safety from Indonesian threats and Malay pressures . So the British were told that their past sins were forgiven , if not forgotten . The future of the Borneo states , Sarawak and Sabah , remains far from clear . These relatively undeveloped and poor countries were brought into Malaysia both to balance the numbers of the Singapore Chinese , and because it was thought that they were too weak to form a new state of their own . This opinion was not shared by the 30 per cent Chinese minority in Sarawak , who had expected and hoped to become the dominant community in a Sarawak once more independent . They opposed entry into Malaysia from the first , and their left wing has actively cooperated with the Indonesian infiltrators along the frontier . Now that Singapore has been excluded , they ask ( and not only the Chinese ask this ) why , if Singapore can be expelled from the federation to suit the politics of Kuala Lumpur , they should be told , almost in the same breath , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that it is " treason , " as the Tunku put it , to suggest such a change . To many it seems more logical and quite proper to question the arrangements which governed their accession to the federation , now that its constitution is so radically altered , and at least to state a claim for reconsideration and revision of these provisions . There are also strong doubts that the far-off Borneo states , no longer politically important as a counterweight to Singapore , will receive in the future much care or consideration from the Malay nationalists in Kuala Lumpur , especially if the successor to the present Prime Minister should prove to be a man of narrower outlook . One possibility which has been mooted is that Brunei , the smallest of the Borneo States but rich in oil , which refused to come into Malaysia , could now become the focus for a new North Borneo Federation . Its oil revenues would underpin the new state and historical tradition supports the idea , for long ago Brunei ( from which the word Borneo is derived ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great island . So far , it seems that this suggestion meets with no response from Brunei and is dismissed as subversion by Kuala Lumpur . Though it is certain that Indonesian confrontation was not the first or even a major cause of the divorce between Singapore and Malaysia , it is far from certain that the result of that change will not be Victory for confrontation : it may lead to that fragmentation of the Malaysian Federation which Sukarno so ardently desires . If Borneo becomes so restive that it can be held in the federation only by force , it is not at all plain who is expected to provide this power . The British and the Australians are unlikely to exercise on behalf of the Malays a role which they would not undertake for their own account . If opposition to Kuala Lumpur took ' the form of Communist insurrection , they might do so , though with widely expanded misgivings ; if the opposition were nationalist it would command sympathy and there would be very strong opposition to the use of British , and Australian forces to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed ' there is nothing which the government in Kuala Lumpur could effectively do to intervene . These are the circumstances in which Indonesia could very well score the triumph in Borneo which it can hardly hope for in Malaya or in Singapore . The Chinese are the one people in Southeast Asia upon whom the creation of an independent state of Singapore may have lasting and profound effects . In the whole region , from Burma to the Philippines , they number about 14 million : a people with a cohesive racial identity , a common culture , a shared way of life , but without a country or a common nationality . Like the Jews in past times , a Chinese in Southeast Asia could always be recognized to be a Chinese , but 211 he was nonetheless a national of the state in which he lived , and very often a second-class citizen in that country . Singapore could change this situation . Here , for the first time , is a Chinese-ruled and inhabited country in Southeast Asia . Small , no doubt , but wealthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either with the Communist mainland of China or the Nationalist regime in Taiwan . It could be the nucleus of the " Third China " ? and by its very independent existence give a status and security to all Chinese in Southeast Asia which they have hitherto lacked , just as the creation of the state of Israel has raised and secured the position of Jews all over the world . There are dangers as well as advantages in this prospect ; in many countries of Southeast Asia the Chinese community is both unpopular and suffers from discriminatory legislation . In some countries these chauvinist policies could be strengthened by the fear that the local Chinese community was turning to Singapore for guidance and protection . On the other hand , the economic power of Singapore will make it a state worth respecting and conciliating . The Tunku 's hasty decision to excise Singapore from Malaysia will prove to have injected a new and unpredictable element into the already complex mixture of Southeast Asian affairs .                @ @ @ @ @
