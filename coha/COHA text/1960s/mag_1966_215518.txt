On exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution is a solid-state computer of 1957 vintage , the first practical large-scale model ever built . This cybernetic antique served as the guidance system for U.S. ICBMs until 1961 and ticked off more than 300 countdowns . The unit was built by the Burroughs Corp . of Detroit , which , though short on share of market-less than 4% com pared with IBM 's 75%-is long on invention , reliability , and lately , profits . <P> Behind the profits are more efficient operations , specialized production , and a shift from space and defense to commercial work . Moreover , Burroughs ' computer operations are now nearing break-even . The company 's 1966 sales will probably reach $500 million , net earnings will be close to $28 million , more than half again as much as the total for 1965 . The sweet sound of financial success should echo for some time to come . <P> Arithmometers to Computers . Next year Burroughs will provide U.S. Steel with the first components of its new B 8500 series , perhaps the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Basic costs for this model are nearly $8,000,000 , or $150,000 per month for companies who prefer to lease their equipment . Already customers are queueing up . U.S. Steel will pay $20 million for its souped up version , which will comprise 221 pieces of electronic brainery . The University of Wisconsin has also ordered a B 8500 for $15 million . <P> The B 8500 is a dream world away from the machine that gave Burroughs its start in St. Louis in 1888 . This was William Seward Burroughs ' arithmometer , an iron-and-glass adding device . For years Burroughs built purely mechanical adding machines , typewriters , cash registers and check printers . Turning to defense production during World War II , the company developed the Norden bombsight , then began dabbling in computers in 1947 , with a small research lab . Burroughs has since developed automated check-reading devices , computers and a new family of moderately priced electronic " business systems " that handle accounting , inventory , payroll , production programming and record keeping for banks or businesses that do not want a high-powered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sells more adding machines than ever before , " according to Chairman Ray R. Eppert , 64 , although it has long since dropped the manufacturing of typewriters and cash registers . The company has capitalized on its years of experience with such hand-operated machinery by applying it to the mechanical aspects of computer technology : punch-card processing , preliminary programming and complex operating instructions . Burroughs paces the industry in providing these essential " software " items along with the hardware - the computers themselves . <P> Two years ago , Chairman Eppert , who started at Burroughs as a shipping clerk 45 years ago , began looking for a successor , found him in Ray W. Macdonald , head of the company 's international sales . Under Macdonald , the company 's overseas operations grew to equal its domestic organization . Macdonald , now 54 , was appointed president last January , will succeed Eppert as chief executive officer Feb. 1 . His expectation : annual sales of $1 billion by the early 1970s.                 @ @ @ @
