Through pattering rain , ten armed soldiers and three officers marched up the driveway of the San Salvador mansion of President Jose Maria Lemus at 10'clock one morning last week . The group 's leader drew his pearl-handled Luger pistol , rapped discreetly at the door , waited . The door opened , and there stood Lemus- barefoot , wearing blue pajamas . " What 's up ? ' ' he asked . " You are no longer President , my colonel , " said the officer . " In fact , you are under arrest . ' ' <P> Still in pajamas , the ex-President was whisked to a downtown fort for 24 hours ' safekeeping before flying off to Costa Rica , where his wife Coralia has relatives . In a bloodless power shift , El Salvador 's middle and upper classes had acted to remedy a situation that had the makings of a bloody , Castro-style revolution . <P> Lemus downfall lay in his steelhanded concept of duty . By long-established custom the wealthy families who control the tiny , crowded ( 305 persons per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run the government so long as they keep order . Lemus tackled the problem of order keeping , aggravated both by agents of Fidel Castro and by one of the Americas ' broadest gulfs between haves and have-nots ( average daily agricultural wage : 60 ) . He outlawed unruly opposition parties , saw to it that persuasive opponents of the regime were jailed . Eight weeks ago Lemus got too tough even for El Salvador . When parading students protested a ban on public meetings , his police responded with clubs , fire hoses and point-blank rifle fire ; boys were beaten and several girls were raped . Horrified by such excess and fearful of total , bloody revolt , the nation 's respectable moderates organized a preventive coup . <P> To replace Lemus the moderates chose a six-man junta : three army officers , three civilians . Colonel Miguel Angel Castillo , at 44 the oldest junta member , was customs-guard chief under Lemus ; Colonel Csar Yez Urias. 40 , was a key officer at San Carlos Fort , where the country 's ammunition is kept ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of El Zapote Fort overlooking the presidential palace , where the army stored most of its weapons . The civilians-Dr . Fabio Castillo , 42 , and Lawyers Ren Fortin Magaa , 29 , and Ricardo Falla Cceres , 30 - are all connected with the university and are considered moderately liberal . <P> The junta promised free presidential elections on schedule in 1962 , freed political prisoners , dissolved Congress and promised to elect a new one soon . To answer the inevitable question , the junta chose as its spokesman Lawyer Fortin Magana . It " definitely will not be of the Cuban type , ' ' he said . To a crowd outside the palace he called : " Because we believe that you deserve more than a crumb of bread and justice is precisely why we are here . " How much more than a crumb it would take to keep El Salvador pacified remained to be seen .
