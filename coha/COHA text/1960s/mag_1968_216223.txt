In an age where much rests on the judgment of public men , the question is of considerable interest . As it happens , most of the weight is on the generalist 's side . <P> <P> ARISTOTLE : The knowledge of the house is not limited to the builder only .

In the course of those meetings General of the Army Omar Bradley , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and the Secretary of State entered into a secret treaty . They agreed that henceforth between them the phrases " from a purely military point of view " and " from a purely political point of view " would be forbidden as utterly meaningless . <P> JOHN GARDNER : Very few of our most prominent people take a really large view of the leadership assignment .
