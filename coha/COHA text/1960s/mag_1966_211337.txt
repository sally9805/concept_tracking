When ex-G.I . George Jorgensen went to Denmark and returned , after a series of operations , as " Christine , " the U.S. public and medical profession alike were appalled at what seemed to be " mutilative surgery . " Attitudes have changed so much since 1952 that last year a Baltimore court ordered Johns Hopkins surgeons to perform an identical operation on a 17-year-old boy . And last week the university announced that it has opened a center for the diagnosis and treatment of transsexuals . Hopkins surgeons have already operated on five men and five women . <P> Emotional Crossover . The longtime champion of these unhappy people is Berlin-born Dr. Harry Benjamin , 81 , who swings his practice between Manhattan and San Francisco . It was he who coined the word transsexual , and his new book , The Transsexual Phenomenon ( Julian Press ; $8.50 ) , is already the standard reference on the problem . It is of prime importance , says Dr. Benjamin , to define what a transsexual is not . He is not a hermaphrodite , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs of both sexes . He is not a pseudohermaphrodite , with the organs of his own sex so unusually formed that they are mistaken for those of the other . He is not a homosexual in the accepted sense . He usually has a normal male physique , but feels emotionally like a woman . The converse criteria apply to the masculine-oriented woman . Both types of transsexuals are likely to be transvestites , preferring the clothing of the " opposite " sex . <P> There is no explanation in heredity or hormones . A possible cause in some cases is that a boy was born when his mother wanted a girl , and she treated him as a girl . By adulthood , says Dr. Benjamin , the crossover of emotion and thought may be so deeply ingrained that " true transsexuals feel that they belong to the other sex , they want to be and function as members of the opposite sex , not only to appear as such . " Psychiatric treatment , including long-continued analysis , has proved virtually worthless to patients who do not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Since the mind of the transsexual can not be adjusted to the body , it is logical and justifiable to attempt the opposite , to adjust the body to the mind . " <P> Radical Procedures . Adjusting the body means , for the male transsexual , castration and the creation of an artificial vagina . For the female , it means enclosing the urethra in a pseudo penis ( which is not capable of intromission ) and reducing the breasts . These procedures are so radical that most U.S. surgeons have been reluctant to try them . Among Dr. Benjamin 's 152 transsexual patients , only 51 have had surgery , and nearly all have had that surgery outside the U.S. <P> Last week 's announcement from Johns Hopkins marked the first time that a prestigious medical center has risked its reputation to give organized help to transsexuals , who are estimated to number 2,000 or more in the U.S. They are probably about evenly divided between men and women , according to Hopkins Psychiatrist Norman J. Knorr , but more men than women ask for , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
