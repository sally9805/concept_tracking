DEAR SIRS : The delegates to our Democratic convention have surely taught us the bitter lesson that they , and not the people , nominate the Piesident . The only way we now have left to change this system is to withhold our votes from their nominee and all the machine Democrats run-ning in 1968 , to teach them the even more bitter lesson that the people , and not the delegates , must elect a President . Lilie W. Naness silence Los Angeles , Calif . DEAR SIRS : In Springfield , Ill. , on Sept. 12 , George C. Wallace said : " If the police could run this country about two years , they would straighten it out " That is a call for a police ? state  --  not behind some " curtain , " not in some backward little country but right here at home Almost five weeks have passed since that ultra-rightist remark . Lyndon Johnson has n't commented on it ; nor has Everett Dirksen . Neither Hubert Humphrey nor Richard Nixon has disavowed such a proposal . ( In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then campaigns about " law and order " and " more money , power and armaments for the police . " ) Spiro Agnew and Edmund Muskie are strangely silent . There have been no indignant editorials in the press . A serious candidate for President of the United States of America calls for a police state and theie is no hue and cry I contend that this is very ominous . Paul E State a case of rigging Brewster , N.Y . DEAR SIRS : The balloting in the American Physical Society reported in the editorial , " New Politics Among Scientists " The Nation , Sept. 301. has had a surprising aftermath . The " Schwartz amendment " which , in Professor Schwartz 's own words , was intended to promote " greater participation by the members . . . in studying how our professional concerns intermingle with public issues , " was defeated by a vote of 9,214 to 3,553 . It now appears that the balloting was , in a sense , " rigged . " The September issue of Physics Today contains three letters protesting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a prejudicial statement by the APS Council . One of the letters , signed by nine members at the University of Pittsbuigh and including both opponents and supporters of the proposed amendment , terms the inclusion " outrageous " and urges that the vote be declared invalid . The APS Council offered a semi-apology , based principally on the ' fact that a separate mailing would have cost more than $2M0 but acknowledging that , " in view of the questions raised , this economy move was perhaps unwise . " The term seems too mild . The amendment would probably not have carried in any case , but it can hardly be doubted that it would have drawn a larger vote if the council had stated its position earlier and refrained from " electioneering at the polls " Physicists are busy people and to follow authoritative leadership at the moment of voting is the easy way out of a complex , unprecedented , highly charged situation . The council 's obliviousness to its violation of elementary proprieties illustrates , I suggest , the tendency to regard political dissent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a free society . On that basis , almost any measure to curb it acquires legitimacy , and we know what that can lead to . Coil 1 ) 7 eher EDITORIALS The Military Supermarket Sen. Daniel Brewster , a member of the Armed Services Committee and a Democratic hawk seeking re-election in Maryland , toured the big war-planes plant of Fairchild-Hiller at Hagerstown last week , accompanied by a company executive and a representative of the United Auto Workers . Employment at the plant , reports George C. Wilson in The Washington Post , has nose-dived from 10,000 to 1,700 . On its face , this visit would appear to be a good example of how the military-industrial complex brings pressure to bear in election campaigns , the more so since Senator Brewster is running against Rep. Charles Mathias , a Republican dove . But Mr. Mathias also campaigns in the defense plants ( Maryland is fourteenth among the states in military prime contracts ) , and he does not feel that the military-industrial complex  --  despite the mutuality of interest among Senator Brewster , the Pentagon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Mr. Mathias sees the question of political influence in a somewhat different light . " We have reached the stage in our development , " he told Mr. Wilson , " where no longer is one man pioneering a weapon that could help the military . . . . We now have instead a kind of military supermarket in which the procurement services can shop around . " The shopping shows every indication of a careful political calculation . For example , Lockheed , the largest defense firm , last year opened a plant in Charleston , S.C. , home of Rep. L. Mandel Rivers , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee . Last year also , General Dynamics , second largest defense plant , placed an electronics subsidiary in Camden , Ark. , after Sen. John L. McClellan , chairman of the Government Operations Committee , had visited the Fort Worth plant where General Dynamics makes the F-111 ( TFX ) . Senator McClellan has said that he asked the president of General Dynamics to take a look at what Arkansas had to offer when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then big defense firms get windfall benefits from their far-sighted location of plants in politically strategic areas . For example , the way has now been cleared so that Lockheed may purchase the huge government plant it has been operating in Marietta , Ga. , home state of Sen. Richard Russell of the Armed Services Committee . The installation covers 730 acres , employs 25,000 workers , and has what is called the world 's largest aircraft assembly plant under one roof . It has been declared " excess " ? that is , by present Air Force needs . Valued at $113,886,000 , it will be knocked down to Lockheed at a price which is undisclosed but which Mr. Wilson reports will be much less than the figure quoted . Because Lockheed had put $60 million into the plant , the Air Force would not permit any other company to bid . Under government regulations Congress had thirty days after the plant had been declared " surplus " to object , to the deal , but the deadline passed and no legislator raised his voice . The military supermarket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , but strategic distribution of resources can and does insure splendid political support . There is no need , a 's Mr. Wilson points out , for defense ? firms to engage in the old-style quid pro quo of American politics ; careful cultivation of " the community of interest " among executives , stockholders , workers and political figures in key areas will do the trick . In a word , it is not the military-industrial complex per se that should be feared so much as the nearly universal willingness to accept the benefits that flow from the military supermarket in the name of national security . Dick in Wall Street Mr. Nixon 's campaign foray into Wall Street occupied more than half Of the first page of the business and finance section of the October 6 New York Times , running over into the inside pages . One story , " Nixon Over Wall Street : His Statement Is a Puzzler " by Terry Robards , originated in New York ; the other , ' Capitol View : A Blunder " by Eileen Shanahan , was a survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question ? what or who impelled him to do it ? The Nixon statement ( which the candidate may not have examined with due care ) is regarded by the reporters ' sources as teeming with substantive errors . Not made public but sent to top executives in the securities business , it was a heavy-handed attack on the " heavy-handed bureaucratic regulatory schemes " of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Johnson Administration , coupled with a strongly implied promise that a Nixon administration would deal more gently with the Wall Street segment of private enterprise . But since Wall Street has been getting along tolerably well with the SEC , even Nixon 's friends are unable to see the need for such emphatic reassurance at this time . In a seemingly wild swing , Mr. Nixon denounced the proposed reduction of sales commissions and the ban on commission splitting among brokers  --  measures which had been approved by the president and board of governors of the New York Stock Exchange and which are about to be voted on by the Exchange membership . Among other misconceptions is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment on'the securities markets . This investigation was initiated not by the SEC but by a Republican member of Congress , Rep. Hastings Keith of Massachusetts ; it was approved by Congress without opposition from any quarter and in fact the affected Wall Street interests testified in its favor . What , then , would Mr. Nixon propose to do about it ? It could be as late as mid-1970 before he could secure a majority on the SEC . Nor do his assurances to his Wall Street contacts take into account the legal obligation of Presidents ( whether Republican or Democratic ) to allow ' regulatory agencies to function autonomously . When this rule is violated , it is usually done with decent circumspection . The Times quotes a senior partner of a large securities THE NATION/ October 21 , 1968 firm : " I hate to say it , but what he has done is written a letter which , in effect , says , ' Look , send me some money and well lift the pressure off you when we get in . ' " Consistent though this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an oversimplification , as implied by another top man who asked , " Is he that hard up for money . . . ? " Yet another senior industry official commented : " It is the first serious mistake of his campaign . He had the votes and he had the money , so why did he have to do it ? " It may be that Nixon was used as a cats-paw by interests opposed to current regulatory compromises in Wall Street . If so , his staff work is not as good as it is reputed to be . Moreover , he lost sight of the major problem of the prudent men in the Street : to preserve a respectable fa  --  ade behind which so-called " investors " can play the stock market as other gamblers ( or the same ones ) play the horses . The present balance between regulators and regulated . is conducive to this end ; Nixon is no friend of Wall Street if he upsets it . Illiterate Greeks Two days after the referendum on the new constitution in Greece ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York : the junta 's strong man , Colonel Papa- ' dopoulos , had arrived in New York unexpectedly . While pickets started forming outside the Hotel Pierre and radio and ' TV networks were seeking to interview him , it became known that the visitor from Athens was actually Foreign Minister P. Pipinelis , who promptly arranged appointments with members of the American Establishment , from Senator Javits to Secretary Rusk . Incredible as the rumor may seem , it still points to the fact that the Greek junta considers the United States its sponsor , and feels that its members may seek inspiration and solace here . The opposition to the junta ( liberals , loyalists , conservatives and leftists ) tacitly accepts this view , with the result that most of its exiled leaders living in London or Paris have refused to visit the United States , with the exception of Mr. Andreas Papandreou , a former American citizen . The referendum can be viewed only in this context : as an instrument whereby the junta seeks to impress some of its American friends  --  and possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 , 1967 . It is not sufficient to say that the referendum was rigged or that it was conducted under martial law ; the question is why it was conducted at all . The answer may be that the junta wanted not only an additional excuse to keep the initiative for itself , and impress " friendly " Americans in the State Department and at the Pentagon , but also to confuse its enemies . It is characteristic that while most American newspapers , including The New York Times and The Washington Post , have blasted the Athens regime for rigging the referendum , they have conceded that the new constitution is not all that bad . The New York Times even guesses that the Greeks might have voted for it in a free referendum . It would seem that these newspapers can not have read this constitution . The point is not whether it is liberal , or 388 illiberal , or that it suspends certain articles ; the point Is that the as-yet-unknown drafters of the document are profoundly illiterate . They confuse constitutional principles , laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system on the three powers ( executive , legislative , judiciary ) , but somehow list at least six , adding the church , a National Council and the army . One of the few known contributors to this charter is D. George Kousoulas , professor of political science at Howard University , and formerly with the USIA , who has been commuting between Athens and Washington for the last year and a half . So it seems that American know-how has contributed not only to a climate conducive to military dictatorship but also to a lowering of the level of constitutional literacy in " underdeveloped " Greece . A Secret No More The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions ( Communist controlled ) has , by an 8-to-1 majority ( the one dissenting vote being cast by the Soviet representative ) , condemned the Russian interference in Czechoslovakia . The action was taken on August 28 but was kept secret until quite recently , when it was made known in Italy . The fact that the action was taken on the apparent initiative of the French and Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the General Federation of Labor in France , serves as Secretary-General of the WFTU and Renato Bitossi , an Italian Communist Senator , is Chairman  --  does not detract from its significance . The WFTU has some fifty-seven affiliates and through them claims a total membership of 120 million . Two issues in particular have in the past prevented the East-West cooperation of trade union and left-of-center groups : a belief on the part of Communist organizations that socialism necessarily implies some form of one-party control , and the related belief that a measure of uniforfnity of opinion , particularly among artists and intellectuals , must be enforced to safeguard Socialist regimes . The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia has badly shaken these dogmas . For the first time since 1945 , therefore , an opportunity is arising to build a measure of East-West opposition among left-of-center ' groups to the drift toward war . If all varieties of Left leadership in the non-Communist world would now formally welcome and support the WFTU position on Czechoslovakia , that might well constitute the first step toward international Socialist action  --  if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East-West " left " opposition to it . The Action Gap After a long and hard sell , President Johnson and his economic and fiscal aides persuaded Congress to boost income taxes , so as to keep the economy in check and inflation from becoming rampant ( as the phrase usually goes ) . When people begin to feel the tax bite , the Administration argument went , they 'll trim back their spending , and pretty soon economic equilibrium will be restored . rye NATION/ October 210 196$ But here it is two and a , half months after the tax hike , and inflation is as rampant as ever . Even some of LBJ 's associates , like Treasury Under Secretary Joseph W. Barr , are beginning to confess publicly that " the response to the surcharge thus far has been slower than anticipated . " The people speak somewhat more harshly . " One of the reasons given for the 10 per cent surtax on incomes was to combat inflation , " a letter writer complained in The Washington Post . " However , in August the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ThiS is another definite example of the American people being sold a bill of goods I. ' by LBJ and his incompetent financial advisers . " In August the consumer price index went up for the nineteenth consecutive month . Prices have risen a whopping 4 per cent in the last eight months , the sharpest such boost in eleven years . And , to compound the deviltry , a Bureau of Labor Statistics spokesman corn. ments : " There is every sign that the figures will continue to increase throughout the rest of the year . " Nor , so far , has the higher tax scale ( which was retroactive on business to January 1 ) had much effect on the economy as a whole . A poll of the nation 's leading private economists forecasts only a " brief . hesitation late this year and early in 1969 , " for " inventory adjustinents " in the private sector . This 183-man group , members of the National Association of Business Economists , also cautioned that inflation would be a continuing problem , and that it would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vice President as a bigger spender than Nixon . If LBJ and his team had got around the country more ( instead of limiting their appearances- to business luncheons and conventions ) , they would have found that today 's American family is solvent as hell , despite the gripes . For example , fewer home owners in the country are two or more payments behind in their mortgages than at any time since mid-1960 . Delinquency ratios on bank-installment loans are the lowest in nine years . Personal bankruptcies declined in the twelve months ending June 30 for the first time in sixteen years . Sitting pretty , the American family therefore took the bigger tax bite in stride and kept right on spending . In fact , retail sales reached a record in August , and there 's every sign that another record was set in September . " The indisputable fact of the matter , " said a recent investment letter published by Goodbody &; Co : , " is that the economy 's buoyancy has many of the government 's top experts flabbergasted . The expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the income tax surcharge would provide the necessary brakes for excessive exuberance , and the makings of what could become a runaway inflation , just have n't materialized . " Another economic thought is now emerging . There is general agreement , even among some Nixon men , that the 10 per cent surcharge will have to be extended beyond next June 30 , the present expiration date . When he committed the nation to the land war in Vietnam , the President for too long delayed owning up ( in public at least ) to the costs involved . Had Johnson asked for higher taxes THE NATiolq/October 21 , , 194 in 1965 , , he  --  and the Vice President  --  might have escaped the gap now building up around the 1968 surcharge . Gruening Senator Gruening , the gallant 81-year-old physician , newspaper reporter , editor ( of The Nation among other publications ) , author , Latin American expert , and distinguished administrator , has now decided to go along with a write-in campaign which he did not initiate . The facts are these : In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic nomination by Mike Gravel , 38-year-old speaker of the Alaska legislature , by the slim margin of 1,954 votes . The Republican nominee is Charles Rasmuson , chairman of the board of the National Bank of Alaska and reputedly the richest man in the state . Senator Gruening was quite willing to accept the primary verdict ; at his age and after a lifetime of notable achievements he did not need another Senate term to round out his career . However , the voters  --  notably those in college communities ( University of Alaska , Alaska Methodist University ) ? set in motion a write-in campaign . " The war is the overriding issue with us , " said one college student , " and this business of two evils just wo n't do any more . The Senator is a positive candidate . " Once the write-in was under way , the Senator agreed to campaign and is doing so with the vigor and enthusiasm of a young Eskimo . ( At 81 he still does twenty-five pushups plus sixteen other sets of calisthenics every day , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These people , " he said of those who initiated the write-in , " represent the hope of the future and I ca n't let them down . " Write-in campaigns are difficult , but the Senator has substantial support . The Daily News of Anchorage and the Juneau Empire are giving his campaign excellent coverage and may well endorse his candidacy . What the campaign needs is money . The best  --  and , quickest  --  way to supply it is simply to send contributions to Senator Ernest Gruening , Anchorage , Alaska . The Negro Vote Always a matter of journalistic interest in Presidential elections , the Negro vote has assumed novel dimensions this year . What percentage of that vote will the Democratic nominees receive ? Will Nixon get the one-third he won in 1960 , or the 5 per cent that went to Goldwater in 1964 ? What will be the size of the Negro turnout , and will it show variations , North to South ? ' What effect will George Wallace have on Negro voting behavior this year ? What do Negroes think and feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do they think and feel ' about their own relation , as voters , to the political process at the national level ? ' What some Negroes say , what many Negroes think and feel , and how most Negroes will vote are , this year , separate , if related questions . John F. Hatchett , until recently director of the Afro-American Student Center at New York University , has referred to Nixon and Humphrey as " racist 382 , bastards . " Mr. Hatchett , who feels that no white American is free of racism ( are all Negroes , one wonders , immune from the same virus ? ) has to say of George Wallace : " At least he is honest about what he stands for . " Honest , perhaps , but not candid . Hatchett 's point of view is interesting , but is it representative ? In full awareness of the novel overtones to " the Negro vote " in this year 's election , The Nation turned to three Negro reporters : L. F. Palmer , Jr. , in Chicago ; Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Muskie entourage in the Midwest industrial cities ) , and Vernon E. Jordan , Jr. , stationed in Atlanta , who is an expert on Negro voting in the South ( see articles beginning on page 392 ) .
