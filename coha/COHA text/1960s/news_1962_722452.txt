txt Washington , May . 19 - Sen. Harry F. Byrd D , Va. today announced sharp opposition to President . Kennedy 's proposals to withhold 20 per cent of per- , sonal income from interest and dividends and to allow a tax break to some segments of business . He charged that " members of Congress have been placed under tremendous pressure by representatives of the ' administration pressing for enactment of these proposals . " His opposition came in the text of a speech prepared for delivery on the floor of the Senate on Monday and released to reporters today . Byrd said the treasury department has not come up with a workable system of withholding the interest and dividend payments . Burden to ' Both Sines " The proposal neither removes the hardships for the small shareholder or depositor who owes little or no tax , nor is it a workable  --  system for the banks and corporations paying the interest and dividends , " he said . Byrd also took sharp issue with President Kennedy on red tape . " He Kennedy has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Byrd said . " But I believe he will change his mind when the internal revenue service undertakes the job of processing 8 million or more exemption certificates and millions of quarterly refunds . " The President said it will not harm the elderly , the widows and orphans , and others of low income  --  but these are the very groups which owe little or no tax and must choose between the exemption and refund provisions . Even if they choose correctly , they are likely to be deprived of the use of their income for a time . Lists 4 Points " Unfortunately , they are likely also to be the ones who thru 1pck of information will not get back what the government justly owes them . " The senator listed four main points in his argument . They are : 1 . " Withholding taxes on interest and . dividends can not be compared w it h withholding taxes on salaries and wages ; its administration would be terribly complex , if not impracticable and unworkable. 2 . " It would , by its inherent deficiencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' or inconvenience we only on taxpaying citizens but also on institutions and businesses used by the government to collect the taxes . 3 . " Respect for our tax system must be maintained . It is necessarily complex enough . Unnecessary confusion must be avoided . The agitating characteristics of this proposal are already clear from public reaction . Tax evasion can not be condoned , but this withholding proposal should be enacted only as a last resort . 4 . " An alternative is available , and it should first be given full trial . The internal revenue service is now assigning numbers to taxpayers to eliminate identification difficulties , and at the same time it is installing computers to show currently what taxpayers owe the government and vice versa . This combination should and will provide information for effective curtailment of tax evasion . " Makes an Exception Byrd 's opposition was seen as a bard blow to the two major sections of the administration 's tax revision bill . The measure passed the House March 29 by a. vote of 219 to 196 , with strong Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a long list of witnesses in open hearings thru May 11 , and will now go into private sessions . Byrd said that in his position as chairman of the committee , he usually refrained from announcing his decision on legislative matters until the committee acts . " I am now constrained , " he said , " by current circumstances and long experience with federal tax legislation to make this statement at this time ; and I do so in my own right as an individual senator from Virginia . " A Kennedy Technique A veteran Capitol hill observer also noted that Byrd was breaking his own precedent by making an advance copy of the speech available for publication prior to the actual speech . This procedure often gives one message double exposure - once at release and then again when the speech is actually made . The method has been used extensively by the Kennedy administration corps of press agents . Byrd said he had given the closest possible study to the President 's statement on the tax measure at the press conference , and had listened to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dillon , before reaching his " firm " position . " Payment Before the Fact " The senator said there were numerous reasons why he was opposed to a 7 per cent tax incentive for investment in machinery and productive equipment . He indicated these are his four major objections : 1 . " It is wrong in principle . It is in the nature of a government payment before the fact instead of a credit for an accomplished fact . 2 . " It is a subsidy in the nature of a windfall to be given to businesses which comply with a government policy . 3 . " It is discriminatory in its application among various businesses , even among those similar in kind . Incentive is a stated purpose of the proposal , but it would be retroactive to last Jan. 1 , and it is difficult to understand how the provisions would be an incentive for investments made before it is enacted . It would be a bonanza for certain corporations which could reach 600 million dollars . Better Credit Available 4 . " An alternative is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now taking action , to modernize internal revenue regulations to provide realistic depreciation credit for plant and equipment . " In a touch of irony , Internal revenue Commissioner . Mortimer Caplin , one of the administration aids who has been trying to get Byrd to change his mind , spoke in the capital of Virginia this morning and suggested that Congress has " the obligation to enact fair , equitable , and understandable laws . " New Problems Posed The senator noted that the dividend proposal would pose problems in the application of the dividend and interest system in the cases of trust funds , partnership investment clubs , and mutual fund clubs , which have become popular in many areas of the country . Of the machinery expenditure credit , he said : " Under present conditionswhen we are faced with a deficit in the current year of 7 to 10 billion dollars and the likelihood Of another deficit of 3 to 4 billion dollars next year  --  I could only " view it as an act of fiscal irresponsibility were we to adopt a 1.4 billion investment credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . "
