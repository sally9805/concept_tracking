O YE JIGS &; JULEPS ! ( 50 pp. ) - Virginia Gary Hudson-Macmillan ( $2.50 ) . <P> Last year 's flyweight bestseller was Winnie Ille Pu , a Latin translation of A. A. Milne 's wonderful beary story . Almost no one could read it , but it sold awfully well ( it looked impressive on the coffee table , and the English original made a dandy pony ) . The book that seems certain to be this year 's small mad success is not written in Latin , and it is not really a children 's book . But it is , or is claimed to be , a child 's book . O Ye Jigs &; Juleps ! , a sheaf of very severe , very funny essays about adult nonsense , shows the world of Louisville as it was seen in 1904 by ten-year-old Virginia Cary Hudson , then a pupil in an Episcopal boarding school . Its publishers say , word of honor , that it is Virginia 's work , discovered decades later in an attic trunk by her daughter . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English teacher allowed her to write out her assignments . <P> Whatever the case , Jigs does not quite have the ring of authenticity achieved by that small classic The Young Visiters , supposedly written at the turn of the century by nine-year-old Daisy Ashford . Nevertheless , Jigs makes some of the best out-loud reading since the original Pooh . " Sacraments are what you do in Church . What you do at home is something else , " Virginia began the rambling essays she wrote for her boarding-school teacher . " When you are little and ugly somebody carries you in church on a pillow , and you come out a child of God and inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven . They pour water on your head and that 's a sacrament . When you are twelve you walk back in yourself with your best dress and shoes on , and you walk up to the Bishop , and he stands up , and you kneel down , and he mashes on your head and you are an Episcopal . Then you are supposed to increase in spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bread in the choir room and it tasted just like my gold fish wafers . " <P> Not all of Virginia 's accounts are godly ; she recalls that " Oscar Sargent bet me my whole bag of gumdrops that Miss Nelly McDonnell 's cat could n't scratch himself out if we buried him . I bet he could . But if he could , he did n't . Oscar says to me. he says ' What do people do with dead bodies ? ' " Still , she is a properly brought up little girl , and she ends every chapter with a prayer . The one that closes the chapter about her garden party ( at which the bishop drank a triple julep and she danced with some little colored boys ) goes like this : " Oh ye Sun and Moon , oh ye beans and roses , oh ye jigs and juleps . Bless ye the Lord . Praise Him and Magnify Him Forever . Amen . "                  @ @ @
