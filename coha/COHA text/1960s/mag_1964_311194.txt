Fortnight ago , a silver-haired Southern gentleman named John Crowe Ransom stood up in Manhattan to receive the 1964 National Book Award for poetry . As founder and editor of the Kenyon Review , mentor to a platoon of celebrated poets and writers , and father of the New Criticism , Ransom is probably the most influential U.S. scholar-critic of the past 40 years . As the author of a few slender books of poetry , he has drawn the highest praise from the knottiest intellectuals of his time . <P> It might be assumed , therefore , that his prizewinning Selected Poems ( Knopf ; $4 ) could not be usefully perused without benefit of The Golden Bough , Kierkegaard , or Kant 's Critique of Pure Reason . Not so . Many of Ran som 's gentle verses deal in genteel terms with subjects easily apprehended by the lingering tea-and-antimacassar set in Ransom 's own home town of Pulaski , Tenn . His topics run to ceremonious family occasions , chivalric legends , brief encounters between might-have-been lovers , small social events , the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pet hen that has been stung to death by a bee : <P> So there was Janet Kneeling on the wet grass , crying her brown hen ( Translated far beyond the daughters of men ) To rise and walk upon it . <P> And weeping fast as she had breath Janet implored us , " Wake her from her sleep ! " <P> And would not be instructed in how deep Was the forgetful kingdom of death . <P> Taken alone , deceptively simple poems like this seem to lack substance . But like the threads of a spider web , a garland of such verse woven together creates a captivating world . Its charm , perhaps , is that it seems oldfashioned . Ransom 's courtly poetic rhetoric seems antique to the ear of an age that banned charm and rhetoric from poetry in order to come to grips with life . Newcomers wandering in Ransom 's poetic kingdom are likely to bark a shin on such arch words as " pernoctated , " or be mildly astonished at the poet 's unfashionable fondness for bucolic life , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery of getting ahead . Ransom 's poems , Critic Randall Jarrell has correctly observed , " are full of an affection that can not help itself for an innocence that can not help itself . " <P> Frozen Dust . Customarily a cavalier poet , even about serious subjects , Ransom sometimes compresses feeling under a surface of grave understatement that eventually reveals , like New England reticence , the hidden vein of pure joy or grief beneath . In the small encounters that he chronicles , a clash of two points of view or a strange moment of fear is often apprehended with a sudden , minute clarity , like two specks of dust frozen in the searchlight of a morning shaft of sun : <P> Robin 's sisters and my Aunt 's lily daughter Laughed and talked , and tinkled light as wrens If there were a little colony all hens To go walking by the steep turn of Sweetwater . Let them alone dear Aunt , just for one minute Till I go fishing in the dark of my mind : <P> Where have I seen before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bare of bonnet , Flowing with music of their strange quick tongue And adventuring with delicate paces by the stream , - Myself a child , old suddenly at the scream From one of the white throats which it hid among ?
