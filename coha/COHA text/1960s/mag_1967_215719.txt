Pope Paul VI issued yet another statement last week cautioning the faithful about ultra-reformist tendencies in the wake of the Second Vatican Council . <P> The Pontiff rebuked those who are trying " to attribute to the council every type of novelty , even going so far as to question fundamental doctrines of Catholicism , declaring that truths defined by the church are matters of opinion . " The Pope 's warning was read with special interest in The Netherlands , where the church is the center of avant-garde thinking within Catholicism . At present , Dutch clerics are involved in theological disputes with Rome over two bestselling books that deal with fundamental church issues . <P> <P> Out of the Vatican ? Slimmer of the pair is The Grave of God , a 178-page volume about the future of the church by Father Robert Adolfs , prior of the Augustinian friars in Eindhoven . Unless the church changes , writes Adolfs , " she has no future . Imperceptibly , she will come more and more to perform functional duties within a social order which is essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own grave , which will at the same time be the grave of God . " Adolfs maintains that the church should give up all claims to worldly power , calls on the hierarchy to divest itself of its " Renaissance splendor , " and suggests that the Pope shed his regal vestments , quit the Vatican Palace and live in Rome . <P> Last week , warming to his subject , Adolfs wrote in the New Christian : <P> " Every time the Pope speaks he reflects the old atmosphere , the old church structures . One can only conclude that the Pope is either a puppet in the hands of conservative Curia cardinals or-which seems more probable-he is himself a conservative to the backbone . " <P> Although his book received an imprimatur from a Dutch bishop , Adolfs was summoned by the assistant general of the Augustinian order last June to a " brotherly dialogue " at an out-of-the-way hostel for vagrants in Eindhoven . Adolfs was read a two-page assessment of his book by an anonymous reviewer , then instructed to reply to a list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was warned , " you will be prohibited to write . " According to Adolfs , the questions reflected a misreading of his book and were " alien to everything that is alive in the church . In this kind of atmosphere , I would implicate myself by answering them . " Adolfs was ordered to have publication of the book stopped immediately ; he left the matter to his Dutch publisher , who is now well into the book 's third edition and plans to keep the presses rolling anyhow . <P> <P> Homosexuals &; Calvin . The second dispute is much more serious , involving the entire Dutch episcopate and a new 625-page catechism that has been on the bestseller list since it was published last October under the imprimatur of Holland 's Bernard Jan Cardinal Alfrink.
