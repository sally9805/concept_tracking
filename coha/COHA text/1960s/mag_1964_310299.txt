Increases in the huge U.S. debt limit - and there have been four of them in the past two years alone-seem to signal a riproaring , breast-beating debate in Congress on Government spending . But last week , when Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon went before the House Ways and Means Committee to request a $9 billion boost that would lift the limit to an alltime high of $324 billion , there was hardly a protest to be heard . The committee did not even bother with a roll call , instead gave speedy voice-vote approval to Dillon 's request . <P> The fact is that President Johnson has gone a long way toward taking the bite out of the spending issue . Two weeks ago , for example , he announced that spending in fiscal 1964 and 1965 would be $700 million under his January estimate , and that the overall deficits for the two years would be decreased by $300 million to a two-year total of $14.6 billion . And while such economizers as Virginia 's Democratic Senator Harry Byrd , who wants to cut spending by $6.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more to say on the matter , the new limit is expected to breeze through Congress with less difficulty than in many a year . <P> Facing more resistance , however , is the Administration 's request to extend for another year some $530 million in excise taxes that were first levied at the beginning of World War II . Led by Wisconsin 's John Byrnes , the Republican members of Ways and Means sought to reduce the 10% levy on jewelry , furs , perfume , cosmetics , watches , luggage and other leather goods to 5% by July 1 and to nothing the following year . With one exception , the committee 's Democrats lined up against Byrnes 's proposal to defeat it by a party-line vote of 14 to 11 . But that is not likely to be the last of it . Byrnes said he would try to excise the excise taxes when they reach the House floor , and a hot debate is in prospect .                    @
