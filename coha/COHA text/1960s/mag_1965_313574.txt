Peterpat . In primordial days , man went forth from his cave to vie with Tyrannosaurus rex . Nowadays , he leaves his office cubicle to do battle with Tyrannosaurus regina-his wife . That is the sempiternal issue with which Enid Rudd has made her playwriting debut in this wry , observant , warm and almost steadily amusing comedy . <P> Peter ( Dick Shawn ) and Pat ( Joan Hackett ) enter marriage with eight-ninths of a child , one-tenth of an income , and 999/1,000 of a conviction on Pat 's part that she has enough love for the three of them . The infant is not seen but heard , and the squally Eine kleine Nachtmusik rasps on Peter 's and Pat 's sleep-starved nerves with the first intimation that they are somewhere east of Eden . <P> Within a few years Peter strikes it rich with a videotic series called Ben Bullet . He takes to wearing one of those silk-sheen suits that look like beaten stainless steel . In his pocket is an offstage mistress , but under his collar is prickly Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kill-and-make-up reconciliation scene . Under Joe Layton 's fluid direction , it is a remarkably resourceful display of in-bed infighting . The sight gags are eruptively funny and the dialogue blends the flip quip with the rueful truth , as when Pat says to Peter apropos of his mistress : " Just think , if you had married her ten years ago , today you could be having an affair with me . " <P> Dick Shawn and Joan Hackett are admirable foils . He paints the clown-husband character with broad vaudevillian brush strokes . She is a comic pointilliste , and her precise inflections of wifeliness dot the brain like a quiver of hatpins . Peterpat sometimes gets enveloped in the vapors of farce , but one deep breath of comic wisdom animates it-marriage is as funny as hell .
