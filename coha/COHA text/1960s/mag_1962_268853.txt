Sweet Bird of Youth ( MGM ) messed up its cage for a season on Broadway , and has now been plumed with Metrocolor . <P> Surprisingly , the play-which contains some of the sleaziest writing done by Tennessee Williams since he became an important playwright-has emerged from its ordeal by camera , thanks principally to Writer-Director Richard Brooks ( Elmer Gantry , as a fast , smart , squalid melodrama that offers its customers three of the year 's top film performances . <P> Like the play , the picture tells the story of a Hollywood beach bum ( Paul Newman ) who rolls on the casting couch with an aging cinemama ( Geraldine Page ) . <P> Most of the time the dame is socked in with vodka or pot , and the no-talent hero tows her around like a whale on a flatcar . <P> Figuring to show the home folks what a big fish he has caught , he Caddies her down to the small Southern town where he grew up . The big blowhard is unaware that on his last trip home he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed Begley ) pregnant , and that she subsequently had an abortion . Now the political boss is a real mean man , and when he hears that the hero is in town . . . <P> Newman , as the young dog who is putting on the cat , creates a memorable portrait of a phony . Begley is pluperfect as the sort of jolly old political Santa who would n't harm a flea-he 's much too busy squashing people . But the picture belongs to Actress Page , who starred with Newman in the Broadway play . She swirls to the girls ' room as if to a coronation , she cuddles her oxygen mask as a normal woman might cuddle a newborn babe , she dimples in maidenly dither at her gigolo 's advances , she proceeds a moment later with hard-nosed efficiency to collect what she has paid for . She is a mascaraed monument to the era of the superstar , a veritable muse of publicity .                    @
