txt // Jutes ' and the belief that it was by special divine favour that their ancestors were allowed to conquer Britain . Pride in this conquest is shown in the final words of the poem on the battle of Brunanburh : the proud assailants , warriors eager for glory , overcame the Britons and won a country . ' Bede 's book also kept them aware of their debt to Rome , whence Gregory , Apostle of the English ' had sent them the true faith . They were not to know that in 1o66 the papacy would bless the banner of a foreign usurper . Bede 's history would take them only to 731 , but there was also available the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle , which was first compiled from earlier sources about Sao and circulated to some religious houses , and thereafter continued in some places . A version which reached the north was interpolated with material taken from Bede and from sets of northern annals . Two of the three surviving versions which were being kept up in the reign of the Confessor were continuations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was by this time at St Augustine 's , Canterbury , while the other , which betrays a special interest in the affairs of Northumbria and of the diocese of Worcester which was sometimes held in plurality with that of York , was probably at York ( though some scholars would place it at Worcester ) . A third version , not based on the northern recension , was being written at Abingdon . These three versions are at times independent , and at other times two of them share a common source . There were other copies of the Chronicle which were not actively kept up , but which would be available for consultation on past history , and we learn of some lost copies ; others may have been lost without trace . Thus many men would have an opportunity of reading about the Danish raids of the ninth century , about Alfred 's victories and about the tenth-century re-conquest of the Danelaw . They could read also of the calamities of the reign of Ethelred , but THE ANGLO-SAXON ACHIEVEMENT ? 2I the older men would remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers ' reminiscences . An interest in various English saints helped to keep alive some knowledge of earlier history and customs . Manuscripts of early Latin saints ' lives , Bede 's Life of Cuthbert and the anony mous Life , Eddius 's Life of Wilfrid ( c. 709 ) , Felix 's Life of Guthlac ( 730-40 ) , continued to be produced , as were also tenth-century works like Frithegod 's Life of Wilfrid and Abbo 's Lift of Edmund , and the Lives of the monastic reformers , Dunstan , Oswald and Ethelwold . Felix 's Life of Guthlac was translated into English , and there were several short vernacular Lives of English saints , some of them intended to be preached on their festivals . Many an illiterate Englishman would have learnt about some of these saints , though his knowledge might include later legendary material which had grown up round the cult . Men of Latin culture continued to use the non-historical works of Bede , and the writings of Aldhelm ( c. 686 ) , whose difficult and ornate diction was often supplied with glosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied . Manu scripts containing letters and poems by Alcuin were written in England in the eleventh century , and his works On Virtues and Vices ' and the To Sigwulf on Genesis ' were translated into English , the latter by AElfric ( c. i000 ) . The fact that most of the pre-Viking age English poetry has come down to us in four manuscripts written in the late tenth and early eleventh cen turies may point to a deliberate attempt to preserve from oblivion their early literature . Yet , as far as one can judge , most Englishmen of the eleventh century would know little or nothing about what to modern scholars is one of the greatest of Anglo-Saxon achievements , the work of the missionaries on the Continent in the eighth century , especially that of Boniface . Since he is not mentioned // by Bede or the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle , and since he was buried in Fulda in Germany and thus no English house could claim him as a wonder-working saint , little is heard of him in late English sources . No manuscript of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , nor any of the collections of his correspondence and that of his successor Lul , which were made by their followers abroad . Only three of his letters can be shown to have been known in England at this time , and it was not interest in Boniface that preserved them . Two , in the original Latin , owe their preservation to the importance of their contents , for in one he and seven other missionary bishops attempted to persuade Ethelbald of Mercia to reform his ways , and in the other he sent decrees of a continental synod to Archbishop Cuthbert of Canterbury . A different type of interest led to the translation into English of a letter describing a vision of the next world seen by a monk of Wenlock , a type of literature which had a wide appeal . The scholar Archbishop Wulfstan II of York ( 1002 ? 23 ) knew of some other eighthcentury documents , but the average Englishman was probably quite unaware of this glorious period in his nation 's past . Some who travelled abroad may have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses ; a far greater number of people would be aware that the productions in illumination , embroidery and metal-work of their own day were highly valued abroad . Up till now , we have considered mainly what literate Englishmen in the Confessor 's reign could read about past history . One must also reckon with oral tradition , which would reach far lower down the social scale . Some events may have been celebrated in poems , for it would be unwise to assume that the few historical poems which found their way into the Chronicle , and the single poem on a local hero , Byrhtnoth of Maldon , which // a series of chances has preserved , are all which once existed : secular poetry had comparatively little chance of being written down . When King Ethelred 's son Athelstan left to his brother Edmund in his will in I015 the sword which King Offa owned ' , we can well believe that he knew far more about this great eighth-century king than he could have learnt from the scanty entries in the Chronicle ; the great dyke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency . Abbot Elfric was probably not drawing on written sources alone when he selected as kings to compare with the Emperor Theodosius as being victorious through God ' , Alfred who often fought against the Danes , until he won the victory and protected his people ' , Athelstan who fought against Olaf and slew his army and put him himself to flight ' and Edgar who exalted the praise of God everywhere among his people , the strongest of all kings over the English nation ' , for whom God subdued his adversaries , kings and earls , so that they came to him without any fighting , desiring peace ' . Though not all the stories which reached the early twelfth-century historian William of Malmesbury are acceptable as history , there is no reason to disbelieve his claim that the places where Alfred suffered ill-fortune were still being pointed out by the local people . There must have survived a widespread admiration for Alfred as a man who snatched victory when in an apparently desperate position ; otherwise we should not find two religious houses in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saint : Durham attributed the victory to the help of St Cuthbert ; St Neots claimed it for their saint , and in the vernacular Life of St Neat occurs the earliest recorded version of the story of the cakes , told to emphasize the depths of misfortune from which the saint rescued the king . Alfred lived on in popular memory also as the writer of books : when Elfric speaks of the books which King Alfred wisely translated ' he probably knew which 24 ? DOROTHY WHITELOCK these were , but the words of his contemporary , the chronicler IEthelweard , an unknown number of books ' , and those in the Life of St New ' , he composed many books through God 's spirit ' , suggest a vaguer tradition . Middle English poetry shows that long after the Norman conquest the memory survived of Alfred as the wisest man that was in England ' . Stories concerning Athelstan also reached William of Malmesbury ; and as for Edgar , traditions concerning his care for justice , his organizing of the fleet and his reform of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are therefore probably justified in believing that many people in Edward the Confessor 's time were fully conscious that their nation had produced strong and victorious kings , and learned and saintly men ; and they thought of their nation as a unity , in spite of local variations in customs and institutions . They would be unlikely to welcome the prospect of a ruler from an upstart state across the Channel ; they would not consider their civilization and government inferior to that of Normandy , nor , as we shall see , had they any reason to do so . It is hardly necessary nowadays to go to great trouble to refute earlier charges of decadence or incompetence levelled against the Anglo-Saxons of the eleventh century , for studies of surviving records and objects have already shed a favourable light on many aspects of their culture , and continue to do so . It is enough to let the facts speak for themselves . In the course of a long history , the monarchy had acquired greater powers than those possessed by most rulers in western Europe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the task of ruling the whole of England , had established a measure of uniformity in certain large matters , while permitting local differences in institutions and customs , especially between the Danelaw and the rest of England . The division into shires , // which was ancient in Wessex , was extended over the whole country as far as the Tees , the shire-meeting being held twice a year . The division into hundreds , which may also have been ancient in some parts of the country , was spread everywhere , except in some Danelaw areas , where the functions of the hundred were performed by a district known as a weapontake ; the hundred ordinance of the mid-tenth century secured uniformity in administration . Its court met every four weeks . Its duties included the maintenance of order by taking action against cattle-thieving , by ensuring that every man had sureties capable of bringing him to court , and by its jurisdiction over all but the gravest criminal suits . The hundred court also apportioned the incidence of taxation . There were also borough courts , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts where two or more hundreds were combined , while in the north there was a court of the riding . The shire court dealt with both criminal causes and civil causes concerning land , and it is in connexion with the latter that documents survive which supply us with vivid glimpses of the thegns of the shire settling local disputes . It is interesting to see how often they prefer to bring the parties to some measure of agreement rather than enforce the letter of the law . Typical is the statement in an account of a Worcestershire lawsuit between a certain Leofric of Blackwell and a man called Wulfstan : Then both Leofric 's friends and Wulfstan 's said that it would be better for them to come to an agreement than to keep up any quarrel between them . ' Though many details of the working of the various courts are obscure , there is enough to show that there was an efficient system of local government in force , and this impression is supported by the insistence of the Norman kings that it should in essentials remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shire or the hundred , and a writ of Henry I in It o8 declares that the shire court and the // hundred court are to be held in the same places and at the same fixed periods as they were held in the time of King Edward , and not otherwise . Though most suits were dealt with at these local assemblies , it was the king 's justice they administered . The hundred was normally presided over by a king 's reeve , the shire by the ealdorman or the sheriff , along with the bishop in suits which concerned the church . The increasing tendency in the later Saxon period for the ealdorman to be in charge of several shires led to greater responsibility of the sheriff for his own shire ; but both ealdorman and sheriff were royal officials , and in addition , the king might sometimes send a special messenger to the meeting . There were some hundreds in private hands , which meant that the representative of the holder of the privilege presided , and that the profits of jurisdiction went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a royal grant . Moreover , there were certain serious criminal charges which were almost always reserved to the king , and not included in a grant of privilege , namely breach of the king 's protection , forcible entry into a house , ambush , the harbouring of fugitives and the fine for neglect of military service . Only a very few highly privileged persons were allowed to handle these . The law which the courts administered was a mass of customary law with various local differences , but supplemented and modified by the statutes of successive kings ; for kings in England had been for centuries accustomed to legislate , and codes survive from seventh-century kings of Kent , from Ine of Wessex ( 688-94 ) , from Alfred and from most of his successors up to Cnut . The laws of Offa of Mercia , which were known to King Alfred , have not survived . Archbishop Wulfstan II , who held the province of York I002-23 , speaks many times with admiration of the laws of Edgar , and made great use of the code which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codes for King Ethelred and a comprehensive code for Cnut . This was the last Anglo-Saxon law-code , and when King Edward in Io65 had to yield to the Northumbrians in revolt against their earl , Tostig , we are told : and he renewed there the law of King Cnut . ' When documents of the Norman kings insist on the observance of the laws of King Edward 's time , they mean this code and established custom , and Cnut 's laws are given the place of honour by the Latin writers who in the reign of Henry I translated and made compilations of the Anglo-Saxon codes and wrote treatises of the law . This was not done in a purely antiquarian spirit , for only a few changes had been introduced by William I , e.g. the murder-fine to protect his Norman followers , the use of the ordeal of battle as an alternative to the Anglo-Saxon methods , and a sharper differentiation between ecclesiastical and lay courts . The continued respect paid to Anglo-Saxon law is strikingly illustrated by the bringing of the aged bishop IEthelric of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 1076 in order to answer questions on Anglo-Saxon law . The two most comprehensive manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon laws were compiled in Henry 's reign , namely the Textus Roffensis and the St Pauls manuscript now in Corpus Christi College , Cambridge . If William was content to make few alterations in the law , he also had little reason to be discontented with the royal rights held by his predecessors . Besides the profits of jurisdiction , the king had over the whole land the three public dues , fortress work , bridge work and military service . From these , immunity was hardly ever granted . Though the precise details of the amount of military service which could be demanded are uncertain , and seem to have varied in some places in accordance with individual agreements made with the king , there is no doubt that his rights were extensive . The Anglo-Saxon military organization was adequate to preserve the land reasonably 28 ? DOROTHY WHITELOCK secure from the Welsh and the Scots , and at Stamford Bridge a great army led by the foremost Scandinavian warrior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings had made arrangements for a feudal army , by granting estates to be held by knight-service , they still continued on occasions to call out the native levy . The king possessed extensive royal lands in most parts of his kingdom , and they could be increased by the forfeiture of lands for grave offences , and by the royal right of inheritance after foreigners or others who died without heir . He had widespread rights to tolls , and from many estates he still received foodrents , relics from a time when this charge had been incumbent on all lands , though by the eleventh century the granting of land by charter , as bookland ' , which was freed from this payment , had greatly decreased the area which paid it . It was probably in relation to these food-rents and to military service that the country was first assessed in hides ( in some Danelaw areas in carucates ) ; but by the late Saxon period this assessment was mainly important for the collection of the geld . This tax , one of the main sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off Viking invaders , but was later used to pay a standing army or navy , and eventually to meet any special need . To operate it , an efficient and flexible system had been evolved by which the geld was taken at a rate per hide which could be varied according to needs , and a sum was demanded from each shire according to the number of hides it was assumed to contain ; this sum was then divided among the hundreds of the shire , and eventually among the estates in the hundred in relation to their assessment in hides . The collection of this tax , and the handling of the royal revenue from all its varied sources , imply an expert and centralized financial system in advance of its day ; the Norman kings used it with little modification for a long period . They also inherited // an excellent coinage : beside the Anglo-Saxon silver pennies the coins of the duchy of Normandy before I o66 make a poor show . From the eighth century onwards the high quality of Anglo-Saxon coins caused them to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coinage on the English model was introduced into Scandinavia . A firm central control was kept ; by the end of the period dies were cut at London , and circulated to the local mints , of which in Edward 's reign there were about seventy ; new issues were made at regular intervals , and the money paid by the moneyers for the new dies went into the royal coffers . A few ecclesiastics , e.g. the two archbishops and the bishops of Hereford and Rochester , were allowed their own moneyers . The fact that coins of Harold 's brief reign survive from more than half of the known mints is evidence for the speed and efficiency with which the system worked . William took it over in full working order . There was thus a high measure of centralized government , and its successful working was made possible by what Sir Frank Stenton has called the most efficient means of publishing the ruler 's will which western Europe has so far known ' , that is the writ ' , a simple letter in the native language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions regarding the king 's wishes or information regarding his acts . Numbers of these writs have survived , usually addressed to the bishop , earl , sheriff and thegns of the shire , or to the bishop , town-reeve and citizens of the borough . A casual reference in a late tenthcentury homily , If the king sends his writ to any one of his thegns ' , suggests that it was common for the king to communicate by this means with individuals , but naturally the writs which had most chance of surviving were those which a religious house had an interest in preserving , those which made grants to them or re-established their claims to estates or privileges . For these purposes the writ began to supersede the older 30 ? DOROTHY WHITELOCK formal Latin diploma ' as evidence of such rights , though diplomas of the old type could still be drawn up occasionally , even after the Conquest . The Norman kings took over the writ in order to communicate with their subjects for all manner of administrative purposes , though gradually it came to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses . One writ of special interest just after the Conquest is not a royal one , but written in the name of the Confessor 's widow , Edith , sister of King Harold : it is addressed to the hundred of Wedmore , informing it of a grant to the canons of Wells , which is the reason for its preservation ; but in addition it asks that you will pronounce for me a just judgement concerning Wudumann to whom I entrusted by horse(s) and who has for six years withheld my rent ' . No doubt numbers of writs dealing solely with ephemeral matters of this nature have perished without trace . The powers of an Anglo-Saxon king were considerable , though during the later Saxon period the increasing tendency to combine several shires under a single ealdorman , or earl , as he was universally called by Edward 's reign , gave this official more influence than had previously been the case . The politics of this reign were disturbed by the rivalry between the families of Earl Godwine and Earl Leofwine . Yet the notion of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the earl was the king 's nominee : Archbishop Wulfstan 's statement , a thegn becomes entitled to an earldom by the king 's gift ' , was copied in a manuscript about the time of the Conquest . In practice , something like a hereditary right of the house of Leofric to the earldom of the original Mercia seems to have been acknowledged , but this did not prevent small earldoms from being carved out of the great area which had formed the Mercian kingdom , and these were given to men of other families . For example , Swegn , Godwine 's son , held the Mercian shires of // Gloucester , Hereford and Oxford along with the West Saxon shires of Berkshire and Somerset , and on his death Hereford and Oxford , at any rate , were given to the king 's half-Norman nephew , Ralf . An earldom in the East Midlands was held along with Northumbria by Siward , and then it passed to Tostig , Godwine 's son , in whose time it can be shown to include Huntingdonshire , Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given to Siward 's son Waltheof . Godwine was earl of Wessex and Kent , and earldoms were created for his sons as they grew up : Swegn held the one already mentioned , Harold had East Anglia until he succeeded his father to Wessex , Tostig was appointed to Northumbria in 105 5 , Gyrth was given East Anglia when zElfgar , Earl Leofric 's son , who had succeeded Harold in this area , became earl of Mercia after his father , and Oxfordshire also was added to Gyrth 's earldom , and finally , Leofwine , Godwine 's son , held Essex , Hertfordshire , Middlesex and Buckinghamshire along with Kent and Surrey . Harold combined Herefordshire with his earldom of Wessex . The complicated re-arrangement of earldoms during this reign looks like deliberate policy : it would not weaken the house of Godwine as long as members of this held so many earldoms , but it would prevent the establishment of earldoms with settled boundaries in which sons might claim to succeed their fathers by right , instead of by royal gift . Without unduly minimizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their triumphant return from exile in 105 z , we should note that this return was made possible in part by the wish of both sides to avoid serious civil war . As the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says : It was hateful to almost all of them to fight against men of their own race . . . and also they did not wish the country to be laid the more open to foreigners through their destroying each other . ' Even after Godwine 's victorious return , the king was no mere cipher , completely 32 ? DOROTHY WHITELOCK controlled by a powerful subject : loyalist attachment to the house of Alfred was strong , and , as we have seen , many institutions made the power of a central government felt throughout the country , mighty though the local earl might be . Though powerful men , Osgod Clapa in 1049 , Godwine and his sons in 105 2 , Earl Elfgar in 105 5 and 105 8 , Tostig in io66 , did not shrink from using armed force to recover their position after they had been exiled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as private warfare , and there was no need in England to establish a truce of God ' as was done in Normandy to prevent private warfare during certain periods . Naturally , England was not free from deeds of violence . Northumbria in particular was a wild land , and we read of a long feud between two local families , in which the part played by a certain Thurbrand in the slaying of Earl Uhtred in 1 o 16 was avenged by Uhtred 's son Aldred , who then in his turn was killed by Thurbrand 's son Carle ; the last act in this drama was the slaughter by Aldred 's grandson Earl Waltheof of most of Carle 's sons in 1073 . Yet this does not seem to have involved others than the families concerned , and in any case the north was exceptional . The Northumbrians who rose against Tostig in 1065 did great damage round Northampton while waiting for the king 's reply : they killed people and burned houses and corn and took all the cattle that they could get at . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , so that that shire and other neighbouring shires were the worse for it for many years . ' Individual acts of treachery and cruelty are occasionally recorded , such as the blinding of the atheling Alfred in 103 5 , and Earl Swegn 's murder of his cousin Beorn in 1049 . Similar incidents can be found in all countries at this time , and perhaps what one should notice is how both these actions shocked contemporary English opinion : they were not taken as normal . Judged on eleventh-century standards , AngloTHE // Saxon England must have appeared a comparatively peaceful place . The readiness of local thegns to settle disputes by compromise no doubt is one element in the comparative freedom from private conflicts . One gets the impression from the documents that the country was rich in good sense . Without internal peace , England would not have recovered so rapidly from the devastations of the Danish wars . Its wealth is not disputed , and the bulk of surviving coinage implies a considerable amount of trade . Already in the reign of Ethelred we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbours , and English traders in Rome , while a document from about this time refers to the presence in London of traders from Normandy , Ponthieu , Flanders , Lorraine , France and the territories of the emperor . There was also considerable trade with Scandinavia , especially from York and the eastern ports , and Bristol and Chester handled trade with Ireland ; one gets a casual reference to Irish traders with cloaks to sell in Cambridge . The imports seem mainly to have been luxury goods , wine , spices and incense , precious metals , gems , ivory and silk , rich robes , furs , glass vessels and some types of pottery ; oil and blubberfish are mentioned also . We learn less about exports . Fine embroidery and metal-work of English manufacture were prized on the Continent , but the chief exports were probably wool and agricultural produce , especially cheese . The fact that these things could be produced in excess of home needs suggests that in some areas at least the land was being competently farmed according to eleventh-century standards . Both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christian men ; yet some traffic of slaves to Ireland was carried on at Bristol as late as the reign of William I. The slave class was probably shrinking before the Conquest because of the frequency of manumission by the owners as a charitable act for the good of 34 ? DOROTHY WHITELOCK their souls . Manumission continued after the Conquest , and gradually the clear distinction between a slave and a free man of the lower classes on economically much the same level became blurred , since the Norman lords judged more by tenurial dependence than by the possession of a wergild ( the price to be paid in compensation if a man were slain ) , which was in Anglo-Saxon times the mark of a freeman . The increase in trade had been accompanied by an extension of urban life . This had received encouragement from the policy of Alfred and his son Edward the Elder of building fortified boroughs as a defence against the Danes , for these offered security as trading centres . It became increasingly common for landowners to possess at least one house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually had property in many large towns , and especially in London . Most citizens were regarded as tenants of the king , and in general he retained the main share of rents , services and profits of jurisdiction , though in many boroughs the earl had a third of the profits , and in some , as at York and Worcester , the archbishop or bishop owned part of the borough ; it was common also for landowners with houses in a borough to have the right of jurisdiction over their own men occupying them . Boroughs were in charge of a town-reeve , and there was a borough court which King Edgar ordered to meet three times a year . It is not possible to access accurately the population of Anglo-Saxon towns , since Domesday Book gives only the number of messuages and we do not know how big an average of inhabitants one should allow to each . London and Winchester are not described in Domesday Book ; York seems to have had some ' , Boo messuages , Norwich 1,320 , Lincoln 1,5 1o , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gloucester , Worcester , Thetford , Ipswich , etc , though smaller , were by no means negligible . After the Conquest , and partly as // a result of it , trade increased and with it the size of towns ; but not uniformly nor immediately : Domesday Book reveals a decay in some towns between 1066 and 1 o86 . Criticism of the eleventh-century Anglo-Saxon church nowadays comes mainly from those who judge a church by its monastic fervour . The zeal of the reformers of the tenth century , which had led to the displacement of secular canons by monks in some places , and to the foundation or re-foundation of many Benedictine monasteries , had largely spent itself by the eleventh century , and the only sizable Benedictine houses to be founded then were Burton-on-Trent about 1004 , and Bury St Edmunds , founded by Cnut in iozo , though there were also smaller foundations . An attempt was made in the laws of King Ethelred to insist on a communal dormitory and refectory in churches served by bodies of canons , and , though this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reign , such as Archbishop AElfric at Beverley and Bishop Giso at Wells , imposed it . New foundations in this reign tended to be for bodies of canons , as were Stow , Lincolnshire , founded in the early eleventh century , and later endowed by Earl Leofric , and Waltham Holy Cross , enriched by Earl Harold , and the smaller foundations of Axminster and Cirencester . Throughout the period people also continued to be generous in gifts to the older establishments , in lands , money and ornaments . Lay donors include the earls , Siward , Ralf , Odda , Leofric , Tostig and Harold ; and of particular interest are the many grants made by landowners to parish churches . Individual piety showed itself also in the prevalence of pilgrimages , to Rome and even to Jerusalem . It became common in the eleventh century for bishoprics to be given to the king 's priests , men who had served him in his writing office , whereas before the episcopate had had a 36 ? DOROTHY WHITELOCK preponderance of monks . This method of rewarding ecclesiastics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to England , nor does it follow that the king 's priests who were thus advanced ( and by no means all of them were ) were unsuited for the episcopal office . Contemporary criticism seems levelled at only two of them , Ulf , a Norman whom Edward made bishop of Dorchester , and who would have been deprived at the Council of Vercelli ( 105o ) if he had not had recourse to bribery ( or so the Anglo-Saxon chronicler believed ) and Stigand , a grasping prelate who held sees and abbacies in plurality , even after becoming archbishop of Canterbury . Most of the bishops appointed from among the king 's priests appear to have given satisfaction , and not only as administrators . Leofric of Exeter collected books and enriched his church with them and with artistic treasures , as well as with land . On the other hand , when the choice fell upon a monk , as it not infrequently did , some of these proved active men of affairs . It is true that the reign of the Confessor produced no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1002-23 ) , who combined deep scholarship with political and administrative ability , and carried out reforms in many aspects of religion , the effects of which reached far beyond his diocese , but the episcopate in Io66 included St Wulfstan of Worcester , a man of piety who was regarded as an ideal bishop , and Aldred of York , an outstanding administrator and political figure . Few appointments seem to have been made without good reason , though in England as elsewhere there was some danger of influence and simony . However , the English church did not appoint to sees mere youths related to the reigning house , as was sometimes done in the duchy of Normandy . What is of particular interest in regard to the late AngloSaxon church is the amount of evidence showing a deep concern with the religious needs of the laity and with the condition // of the parish priests in charge of them . A large number of homilies were produced , especially by IElfric , abbot of Eynsham , to be preached by the clergy to bring home to ordinary men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from heresy , and to inculcate proper Christian behaviour . lElfric issued between 990 and 991 two volumes of homilies for the major festivals of the Christian year , and during the rest of his life he continued to revise these , and to add new homilies for Sundays not covered in his original work , as well as a series mainly of lives of saints , which might urge men to emulation of their virtues . From the manuscripts of these works which survive , it is clear that they were much used and copied . His contemporary , Archbishop Wulfstan II , also wrote many homilies , some of straightforward instruction on doctrine and morals , some of impassioned appeal for repentance . These too became widely known . Both these writers also produced works in Latin and in English which are directed towards the improvement of the secular clergy : ) Elfric wrote for these pastoral letters , at the request of Bishop Wulfsige of Sherborne and of Archbishop Wulfstan , who himself is the author of sets of canons . One of Wulfstan 's most interesting writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction and examination of candidates for orders . This is a practical document , and while it admits that there might be occasions when out of necessity one would have to ordain a half-trained ' candidate , it insists that such a man must give an undertaking to continue his studies . Both Wulfstan and Elfric , monks by training , make many appeals for a celibate priesthood , but with little obvious success ; Wulfstan seems to have had to tolerate married priests in his northern diocese . His writings also consider the duties of bishops and of bodies of secular canons ; there seems in fact no section of the church which he does not examine . Though after his death in IO23 the Anglo-Saxon D // church produced no one to equal him , a continued interest in these reforms is shown by the production of manuscripts of his work , as well as of IElfric 's , and of translations of canonical writings of continental authors . There is no reason to suppose that the average bishop neglected the spiritual needs of his diocese ; care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their church , though the nature of our surviving records makes this appear to loom more largely . Latin scholarship had flourished after the tenth-century monastic revival , as is proved by saints ' lives and canons written in this language , by the continued production throughout the period of manuscripts of Latin authors , and by the wide knowledge of these visible in the works of men like IElfric and Wulfstan , who were familiar with many works of the Fathers and of Bede , Aldhelm and Alcuin , as well as with canonical writers , especially of the eighth and ninth centuries . For the teaching of Latin , IElfric composed a Latin ? English grammar , and an amusing colloquy to exercise his pupils in Latin vocabulary . Yet the glory of the late Anglo-Saxon period was its English writing . At a time when no vernacular prose of any distinction had appeared on the Continent , the Anglo-Saxons had developed a language of great copiousness and flexibility , capable of rendering Latin works on theology , philosophy and science . They had translated the gospels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Benedictine Rule and that of Chrodogang of Metz , some of Alcuin 's treatises , and of the canonical writings of Amalarius of Metz and Theodulf of Orleans , and some of Bede 's scientific work . These translations show a great advance in style on the renderings in Alfred 's reign of Gregory 's Pastoral Care and Dialogues , Augustine 's Soliloquies , Boethius 's Consolation of Philosophy , Bede 's Ecclesiastical History and Orosius 's History against the Pagans , which were // still available . Many of fElfric 's homilies are based on Latin sources , but not slavishly ; they show a control of language , a grace and a balance , which has never been surpassed . A different , but still a distinguished style was written by Wulfstan , capable of eloquence and force , and there are other excellent varieties of style in various anonymous authors . Strong and vivid narrative , not dependent on Latin originals , is found in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle . Though the reign of Edward produced no writers of the calibre of IElfric or Wulfstan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some charters show that the power to write good English prose not only continued until Io66 , but survived in some places as late as the early twelfth century . But the copious vocabulary needed for abstruse subjects did not survive , since after the Conquest Latin was used for such themes . A distin guished foreign scholar has commented : It is almost pathetic to ponder on the expenditure of energy that was literally wasted , and the unrealised endeavour swept away by political change , through no inherent deficiency of its own . ' l No good Anglo-Saxon poetry later than the poem on the battle of Maldon , composed not long after the event of 991 , has survived ; the few later poems in the Chronicle and some didactic religious verse are of very inferior quality . As has been mentioned above , the chances of survival of secular poetry of the Maldon type are poor , and hence we can not be sure that this poem was the swan-song in which the heroic ideals of loyalty and courage , of preferring death to flight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideals themselves were not dead , and that the stand made by some of Harold 's followers after his death at Hastings would have lent itself to a similar treatment to that given to Byrhtnoth 's bodyguard 40 ? DOROTHY WHITELOCK at Maldon : I-Iere lies our lord , all cut down , the hero in the dust . Long may he mourn who thinks now to turn from the battle-play . ' What , however , we do know is that Anglo-Saxon poetry in the alliterative metre must have survived underground , to emerge again , with modifications , in Middle English in Lagamon 's Brut and in the fourteenth-century alliterative poetry of the West Midlands . The Benedictine revival of the late tenth century resulted in a great flowering of manuscript illumination , which owed much to continental models , but soon branched out in independence . It produced two main types : fully painted miniatures and pictures , often in a framework of acanthus-leaf design , in rich colours and gold ; and outline drawing of great vivacity , characterized by delicacy of line and a remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine manuscripts from the last hundred years of Anglo-Saxon rule , mainly psalters , gospels , benedictionals and other books of ecclesiastical use , though there are others : the Psychomachia of Prudentius was often illustrated , and there is an illustrated copy of Gregory 's Commentary on E ( ( echiel , one of Aratus 's astronomical work , the Phcenomena , one of Elfric 's Heptateuch and one of the Junius manuscript of Old English religious poetry in the Bodleian Library . Several illuminated manuscripts produced in England were taken abroad . Our records tell us of some donors , for example that Cnut and his wife Emma gave a sacramentary and a psalter to Cologne , that Emma gave a benedictional to Robert , abbot of Jumieges and that an abbot of Ramsey gave illuminated manuscripts to Fleury . But even without such references , surviving manuscripts would show the export of English illuminated manuscripts to the Continent , and their influence can be seen in the products of some continental houses , such as St Bertin 's at St Omer and St Vaast at THE ANGLO-SAXON ACHIEVEMENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illumination , some of the earlier freedom and spontaneity has given way before an urge to stylization and pattern , but it remains an expressive and beautiful art . In some English houses , at least , its influence continued after io66 , all the more easily because the Normans had been familiar at home with the styles based on the Anglo-Saxon manuscripts which they had imported . Plate I reproduces one of many beautiful outline drawings contained in a psalter of about 1050 . Artistic products in other media had less chance of survival : objects in precious metal tended to be melted down in times of stringency , and textiles and wood are perishable materials . The richness of Anglo-Saxon England in works of art in these materials can be learnt mainly from references in our sources , in narratives , in wills and lists of benefactions , and in inventories , often of later date . We learn of crucifixes and images in , or covered with gold and silver , sometimes studded with precious stones , of valuable church plate and candelabra , of magnificent vestments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in precious metal and in textiles was valued abroad . The quality of English embroidery can be seen in the remarkable stole , made between 909 and 916 , which was found in St Cuthbert 's coffin , and the post-Conquest Bayeux tapestry is English work . Ivories also survive , and some smaller objects of metal , to show the artistry and skill of Anglo-Saxon craftsmen . Plates za and b illustrate two ivory objects of the late tenth or early eleventh century . As for stone-carving , the date of some of the finest examples is disputed , but most experts now assign to the late Saxon period such dignified sculptures as the Langford and Romsey roods and the Barnack Christ in Majesty ' ( Plate 3 ) . No just appraisal of late Anglo-Saxon architecture can be made , seeing that none of the cathedrals or larger monastic churches have survived . It would appear , however , that even 42 ? DOROTHY WHITELOCK ambitious prelates had not been inspired to emulate the grandiose churches which were springing up on the Continent , and , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Westminster was built in the new fashion . The Anglo-Saxons seem to have been loath to sweep away earlier buildings long hallowed by religious use , and in some places the need for greater accommodation was met by the adding of a new church on the axis of one or more older churches . At St Augustine 's , Canterbury , Abbot Wulfric planned to join two earlier churches by means of a great rotunda , but the Conquest intervened , and it was never completed . We have to judge , therefore , from the smaller churches . Far more Anglo-Saxon work survives in our parish churches than has hitherto been realized , and records show that several were being built right at the end of the period . We read , for example , of churches consecrated by Wulfstan , bishop of Worcester , 1062-95 . Among the more impressive examples of late Anglo-Saxon architecture are the churches of Stow , Lincolnshire ; Worth , Sussex ; Hadstock , Essex ; St Benet 's in Cambridge ; and the well-known towers of Earl 's Barton and Barnack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples of the decoration by means of pilaster-strips , arcading and long-and-short work at the quoins , and of the double belfry windows , characteristic of this period . It has not been the intention of this chapter to demonstrate how much of the civilization of the Anglo-Saxons survived the Norman conquest ; this has been touched on here and there , when it was necessary to use post-Conquest evidence to prove that some aspect of this civilization was still vigorous in 1066 . The Normans made many changes : a new aristocracy replaced the English higher classes , mainly holding its lands by knight service , and one result of this was to lessen the freedom with // which women could hold land ; the higher ecclesiastical offices were filled by Normans , and this brought the English church more rapidly into contact with continental developments in scholarship than would otherwise have happened ; for a time Latin largely superseded English for official purposes , and Norman French as the spoken language of the upper classes . Yet , in the end , it was English , reinforced with much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger monarchy than that of the Anglo-Saxon kings , but in doing so he was building on the foundations which these had laid . Yet , even if the Conquest had been as destructive of what went before as used once to be believed , the six centuries of Anglo-Saxon rule in England would remain a remarkable achievement . This book is designed to commemorate the ninehundredth anniversary of the battle of Hastings . The battle is described in detail and its consequences are to be considered both in relation to the ancient English kingdom which was thereby to pass under a new ruler , and in connexion with the political and ecclesiastical changes which thereafter ensued . The other papers in this volume thus deal with large questions of general importance to English history , with which the present essay has no concern . But there may be room in such a commemoration for a comment on the personality and career of the central figure in the drama of io66 ? the Norman duke who on the evening of 14 October io66 stood victor on the downs above Hastings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallowed as king of the English in the abbey church of St Peter at Westminster . But even if the subject be thus rigidly circumscribed , it none the less presents difficulties . So much has been written on William the Conqueror that it might well be doubted whether anything more could usefully be said about him . He is familiar to schoolboys and scholars ; facts and fictions about him are part of the currency of general conversation ; and even to-day he is one of the few figures in the English story about whom it is considered shameful , or eccentric , to profess ignorance . The fact , indeed , deserves some note . England is perhaps unique y 48 ? DAVID C. DOUGLAS among the nations in having taken so thoroughly to herself a successful invader from overseas ; and she has been content to start the long succession of her numbered kings from a man who began his rule by conquest . Considering the remote age in which he lived , and the circumstances of his life , it is surely remarkable that this eleventhcentury magnate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English consciousness . That he has done so might of itself be cited as testimony to his historical importance . But it has been due also to the fact that the literature concerning him has been not only of long duration but of a very peculiar character . A mass of erudition has been expended upon his life and work ; and over the centuries a war of words has raged about him . His career has provided a constant text for political controversies and social sermons , to such an extent that sometimes he has almost seemed to remain a figure in contemporary politics . He has been presented in terms of Whig theory , of sectarian fervour , and of modern nationalism . He has been hailed as one of the founders of British greatness and as the cause of one of the most lamentable of English defeats . He has been pictured as an enemy of Protestantism and as both the author and the subverter of the English constitution . Indeed , it might almost be said that the influence which he has exercised on English growth has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by what men thought , or imagined , or hoped , that he did . Even to-day , it is hard to escape from the consequences of these controversies , but it is clear that any description of the Conqueror , and any account of his life , must seek to do so . William , if it be possible , must be pictured against his own eleventh-century background . More particularly must he be placed in his own Norman setting . Not only was he a Norman by birth , but the major part of his life was spent in Normandy . // It was as a Norman duke that he came to England , and his conquest was effected by one who had already shown himself the exceptional ruler of an exceptional province . And it was as a Norman king of the English that ( for good or ill ) he influenced the subsequent development of England . His career did not begin in io66 nor did it then end , and it will be a primary purpose of this essay to suggest that what he accomplished as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved as duke . William the Conqueror was born in 1027 or o28 , being the bastard son of Robert I , sixth duke of Normandy , by Herleve , a girl of Falaise , and on his father 's death in 1035 , he became , when still a child , the ruler of a province which was then unique in Christendom . Normandy in 103 5 can be regarded as the product of two contrasted traditions , both of which were to affect the whole career of William himself . The first was Scandinavian . It is very usual to ascribe the special characteristics of Normandy to the intrusion of a Scandinavian population into this region of Gaul during the previous century , and to find the starting-point of the history of medieval Normandy in the establishment of Rolf the Viking ( Rollo ) and his followers in Neustria between 911 and 918 by means of grants made by the Emperor Charles III . Nor is evidence wanting to support such an interpretation . Later chroniclers assert that there was a considerable repopulation of Neustria in the tenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had formerly distinguished the province of Rouen was severely disrupted by the invaders . The surviving lists of Norman bishops show gaps at this time which are testimony to the disintegration that had occurred , and it is probable that in the third decade of the tenth century not a single monastery remained in the Norman land . Again , despite 50 ? DAVID C. DOUGLAS the politic conversion of Rollo to Christianity , the ruling dynasty itself seems only slowly to have renounced the traditions of its Viking past . Even as late as 996 , a French chronicler could refer to the Norman duke as a pirate chief ' , and within twenty-five years of the birth of William the Conqueror his grandfather welcomed in his capital of Rouen a Viking host which had recently spread devastation over a considerable area of north-western France . In short , it would be rash indeed to minimize the Scandinavian factor in the making of the Normandy which William ruled . On the other hand , it would be equally rash to give it too great a prominence . On many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenth century do not seem to have interrupted a tenurial continuity which apparently here proceeded with scarcely more modification than elsewhere in Gaul , and the place-names of Normandy have been held to indicate a society in which men from the north formed only a minority . These , moreover , seem soon to have been absorbed . Ademar of Chabannes , writing about 1030 , goes out of his way to emphasize how quickly the new settlers had adapted themselves to the civilization into which they had entered , and we have the contemporary word of Dudo of Saint-Quentin that by 1025 Scandinavian speech was already obsolete in Rouen though it still persisted in Bayeux . At the same time , trade and ideas flowed across the insubstantial land boundaries of Normandy and up and down the great waterway of the Seine . Viking Normandy , in fact , quickly assimilated the surrounding culture of France , and despite the survival of Scandinavian traditions among them , William and his followers when they came to England were French in their speech , in the essentials of their culture and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier history of Normandy that one of the chief results of the Norman conquest was to deflect the destinies of medieval // England away from the Scandinavian north and towards Latin Europe . William 's reign as duke of Normandy was also to be conditioned by the fact that the province over which he presided was itself of ancient delimitation . It was in fact almost precisely the pre-Viking ecclesiastical province of Rouen with its six dependent bishoprics , and this in turn was based upon a division of the old Roman Empire . The ducal ancestors of William had thus been able to build upon established foundations , and they had in fact used many of the older institutions of government , inheriting traditional rights to revenue and to military obligations , inheriting , too , such powers as had been vested in the counts of the Carolingian age , and also authority over constituted local officials such as the vicomtes . This was , in fact , to stand William in good stead during his terrible minority , and it helps to explain his survival during the perils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 103 5 tested the ducal authority to the uttermost , and the horrors of his boyhood have been often and luridly described . His court was a shambles ; his guardians nearly all perished by murder ; and he had himself frequently to be taken from his home by night to seek refuge in neighbouring dwellings . Elsewhere the province was given over to private wars among the greater Norman families , almost all of whom were involved at this time in violence or disaster . There is no doubt that William 's minority was one of the darkest periods in Norman history . That these calamities were not ( as might have been expected ) fatal to William , and to Normandy , was certainly due in part to the inherited authority that had come to be vested in the ducal office . It is remarkable , for instance , that during these tumultuous years nearly all the vicomtes regularly discharged their duties ; the ducal revenues continued to be collected ; and the bishops of Normandy seem , in general , to have given their 52 ? DAVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear also that the boy duke , or those who acted for him , had a specifically ducal force at their disposal . In short , the traditions of ducal authority and the administrative machinery which might give it effect were sufficiently strong to enable the ducal power to survive the critical decade between 103 5 and 1046 . How important this was can be judged by reference to the revolt of the western vicomtes which broke out in 1047 , when the duke needed to be rescued by his overlord , the French king . By that time , however , William had reached maturity , and was beginning to exercise his personal influence on the afflicted duchy he had inherited . Yet if the battle of Val-es-Dunes signalized the end of Duke William 's minority , it marked also the beginning of six more years of uninterrupted war in his struggle for survival . It is unlikely for instance that the strong fortress of Brionne in central Normandy held by his enemy Guy of Burgundy ' was retaken before the end of 1049 , and it is doubtful whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Io50 . At the same time Geoffrey Martel , count of Anjou , who had risen to a position of dominance in western France was starting to exercise pressure on Normandy through Maine . As a result , during the winter of 1051 ? 2 Duke William was engaged in his famous campaign which resulted in the sack of Alencon after siege , and in the capture of Domfront . In all this continuous warfare between 1046 and 1052 it should be noted , moreover , that William had the support , active or passive , of King Henry of France . But before 15 August in the latter year Henry transferred his support from the Norman duke to the count of Anjou , and henceforth the king of France , far from being the ally of Duke William , was always to be his most formidable opponent in Gaul . This transformation of political filiations has been described by a great French historian as constituting nothing less than a turning point in history ' , and certainly its // results were to be far-reaching . The relations between Nor mandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more than a century with consequences that were not to be fulfilled until after 1154 when Henry II from Anjou became duke of Normandy and king of England . These were long-term developments , but the immediate effect of the change was to create a lethal threat to Duke William whose danger was further enhanced by the fact that it was not only from outside Normandy that he was now menaced . During these same months , two of his uncles , William , count of Arques and Mauger , archbishop of Rouen , who between them controlled much of eastern Normandy , revolted against their young nephew . William , therefore , once again faced destruction , for there is little doubt that if this coalition from Arques and Rouen , from Anjou and Paris had ever been brought in unison against him , he must have succumbed . In the event , he was able to capture the stronghold of Arques before Normandy , early in 1054 , was invaded by a strong force collected from all over France by the French king . It entered Normandy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in February 1054 at the battle of Morte mer . It was an important engagement , for at Mortemer the crisis of Duke William 's Norman reign was met and passed , and never again was the integrity of his duchy to be threatened as it had been imperilled between Io46 and 1054 . The French king 's raid in 105 7 which was repelled at Varaville was a minor affair , and the deaths of Geoffrey of Anjou and King Henry of France in Io6o did but give final assurance that the perils which had been faced during the previous fourteen years had at last been surmounted . The severity of the long struggle which occupied all the youth and early manhood of William the Conqueror needs to be borne in mind in estimating his character and assessing his 54 ? DAVID C. DOUGLAS achievement . Indeed , one of the most difficult questions of Anglo-Norman history is here involved . In Io66 William was able to effect the conquest of a great kingdom . But it is by no means easy to explain how he was able to undertake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he was able to bring it to a successful conclusion . In 1054 , when he was at last freed from his worst perils , he was some twenty-six years of age ; all his life , he had been involved in defensive war ; and Mortemer is separated by only twelve years from Hastings . The contrast between the strength of Normandy in Io66 and its weakness at the beginning of William 's reign is in fact so remarkable that it is only to be explained firstly by the personality of this young ruler , and secondly by reference to aristocratic and ecclesiastical developments within Normandy which William somehow succeeded in harnessing to his own policy and his own purpose . It is unnecessary to emphasize the importance to William 's achievement of those great Norman families whose names were to become household words in medieval England , and indeed in medieval Europe . This was perhaps the most remarkable secular aristocracy produced in Europe during the earlier Middle Ages , so that it is important to note that it was in Io66 only of comparatively recent establishment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traced back before the first quarter of the eleventh century , and many of the greatest of them such as Tosny , Beaumont , Grandmesnil and Montgomery only then acquired their landed wealth , and the territorial names by which they later came to be distinguished . Their advance was , however , thereafter to be extremely rapid , and it presented special problems for Duke William . It is thus of fundamental importance to an explanation of William 's later achievement that under his rule as duke the rise of this aristocracy should // have been made to contribute not to the disunity of his duchy but to its strength . For this was not inevitable . Feudal organization developed gradually in Normandy with the tumultuous rise of this new nobility : it was not imposed , as in England , by the administrative policy of a prince . All the more notable , therefore , was it that William managed to enlist the support of these families to his own cause during his hazardous reign as duke . His success in this must be attributed to his own personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find closely associated with the duke a group of young men ( tirones ) which included William fitz Osbern ( later earl of Hereford ) William I of Warenne ( later earl of Surrey ) and Roger II of Montgomery ( later earl of Shrewsbury ) . Again , during the defence of Normandy against the French king in 1054 the war was waged by families who were in each case operating near their own estates : Tosny , for instance , in central Normandy ; Mortemer and Giffard in the east . The result was notable ; and it was to affect all the future . After the defeat of William , count of Arques , in 105 3 , there was no major revolt among the Norman aristocracy , and in io66 the vast majority of the Norman nobility were ready to stake all their newly-won fortunes on the success of Duke William 's adventure overseas . Equally important to the development of Normandy under Duke William was an ecclesiastical revival . This , particularly in respect of the Norman monasteries , has attracted so much attention from historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is important to note that this movement , also , was of comparative late development . The first definite evidence that the Norman bishoprics were being reconstituted comes from a charter of 990 , and of the ten principal religious houses that were in existence in Normandy at the time of William 's accession only four had been re-established before 56 ? DAVID C. DOUGLAS I000 , and four more had been set up since his birth . The subsequent resuscitation of Norman monastic life was , however , to be astonishingly rapid , and after 1047 , the new Norman aristocracy took over from the ducal house the work of patronage ; so that by 1066 the Norman land was famed throughout western Europe for the extent and for the quality of its monastic life . Distinct from this , but by no means negligible , was the work of the Norman bishops between 103 5 and Io66 . Their achievements were in the main ? though not exclusively ? mundane . Hugh , bishop of Lisieux , and John , bishop of Avranches , were by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and England would have been very different apart from the careers of Odo , bishop of Bayeux , and Geoffrey , bishop of Coutances . The general result of this ecclesiastical revival was to prove little short of spectacular . An ecclesiastical province , of no abnormal size , which in Io66 could be represented by men of such contrasted distinction as Odo of Bayeux and Geoffrey of Coutances , Maurilius , archbishop of Rouen , John of ' Avranches , Hugh of Lisieux , Lanfranc , then abbot of St Stephen 's , Caen , John , abbot of Fecamp , Herluin , abbot of Le Bec , and the young St Anselm , was in very truth not to be ignored . The ecclesiastical and aristocratic developments in Normandy during Duke William 's Norman reign were , throughout , most closely associated both with each other and with the policy of the duke . The new aristocracy had shared with the duke the sponsorship of the monastic revival , and , with the single exception of Maurilius , archbishop of Rouen , from I0S4 to 1067 , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducal house or of the greater Norman families . In this way the aristocratic , the ecclesiastical and the ducal advance in Normandy had become merged into a single political achievement which could perhaps be summarized by // saying that in 1065 a man might go from end to end of Normandy without ever passing out of the jurisdiction , secular or ecclesiastical , of a small group of inter-related great families with the duke at their head . For William had established himself at the centre of this progress . He had identified with his own , the aims of the new aristocracy . In like manner , his influence pervaded the reformed Norman church being expressed in all major appointments , and more particularly in the provincial church councils . But perhaps this inter-related development was expressed most clearly in his ducal courts , which , attended by the secular and ecclesiastical magnates of Normandy , steadily increased in importance after 1054 . It was in every way a notable curia which , sometime after Io6o , confirmed at Bayeux the gifts made by Bishop Odo to his cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in 1066 , ratified at Fecamp grants made to the abbey of Coulombes . Most certainly , too , the assembly which met at Caen in July 1066 , and which , as stated in the relevant charter , looked out on the comet which was even then illuminating the Norman skies , was a court of which any European ruler might have been proud . It symbolized the rapid and intense concentration of power which had been accomplished in this province of Gaul , and which was itself one of the most notable political phenomena of mid-eleventh-century Europe . From this , indeed , was to derive much of the strength which made possible the improbable success of William 's invasion of England . William 's invasion of England was not only facilitated by the developing strength of the province he ruled . It was the outcome of a policy which was of long duration . The establishment of the English Danelaw , and of the Viking dynasty in Neustria had forged links between England and Normandy from which 58 . DAVID C. DOUGLAS neither could escape . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Norman duke had given dynastic expression to this inter-dependence , and the deposition of Ethelred , and Emma 's second marriage to Cnut , his supplanter , was of scarcely less importance to Normandy than to England . Nor was it merely the ruling families which were concerned . The political filiations of England with Scandinavia , and the changing position of Normandy within Gaul , were likewise reciprocally involved . Yet if William was , here , heir to a tradition he , none the less , enlarged it . Even during his boyhood the issues that were involved were being given clearer definition . He may well , for instance , have watched the exiled sons of Ethelred II at his father 's court . The athelings , Edward and Alfred , took refuge in Normandy very shortly after the establishment of Cnut in England , and their claims to England were kept alive in the duchy . It was during this period , for instance , that Edward 's sister Goda was given in marriage to Dreux , count of the Vexin , who was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is usually to be relied upon , asserts that William 's father actually planned an invasion of England on Edward 's behalf and collected ships for that purpose . The story is unconfirmed , and , though not impossible , must be received with caution . But there can be no doubt that Edward 's succession to the English throne in Iooz could be regarded as in some sense a victory for Norman policy . The murder of his brother Alfred in England in 1036 had caused an outburst of indignation in Normandy , and it was to be used at a later date as a cardinal point in Norman propaganda which made Godwine , earl of Wessex , responsible for the crime . Certainly , after Edward 's accession , the Norman dynasty , under William , must have felt itself in some measure committed to the cause of the new king in England . It will be recalled also how conscious Edward the Confessor // was of this , and how ready he was to turn to Norman support both in his dealings with the great earls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazardous defence of his kingdom against Scandinavian attack . But certain qualifications should be made with regard to his acts in this respect . His policy of introducing Normans into England was not wholly original , for some Normans had followed Emma to England in Iooi , and , though these receded into the background after her marriage with Cnut , they were precursors of the men who responded to her son 's invitation . Moreover , the new Norman aristocracy was , during these years , too fully occupied in establishing itself at home to pay much attention to England . Indeed , of the laymen who came from France to England in this period few , except Earl Ralph the Timid from the Vexin ( the son of Dreux and Goda ) were of the first rank , and no Norman layman at this time seems to have been given possessions in England of any wide extent . In the church , however , the situation was different . Norman clerks appear in the royal household early in Edward 's reign , and the introduction of Norman prelates into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bishop of London , and more particularly Robert , abbot of Jumieges who became archbishop of Canterbury in 1051 , was a characteristic feature of the reign . Nor is there much doubt that , as generally believed , Edward had by 1051 designated Duke William as his heir . In these circumstances , the unsuccessful rebellion of Earl Godwine in lo 5 I , his triumphant return in 10 5 2 and the succession of Harold to the earldom of Wessex in 1053 , were obviously of direct concern to Normandy since these earls of Wessex were irrevocably opposed to the Norman succession in England . But between i o 5 I and 1054 Duke William could make no intervention in English affairs , since , as has been seen , he was during those years involved in one of the major crises of 6o ? DAVID C. DOUGLAS his own reign . Nor was he able to oppose the plan formulated in England during the next four years to substitute as the Confessor 's heir , the Atheling Edward ( son of Edmund Ironside ) , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return from exile , and his very suspicious death in England in 1057 , the Norman duke must surely have realized that his chief opponent in England was likely to be Harold Godwineson who , from this time forward , was evidently contemplating the succession for himself . All the complex elements in Anglo-Norman relations thus began to be crystallized into an individual rivalry between two of the most remarkable personalities of eleventh-century Europe . But William must also have been aware that the impending struggle would be a triangular contest . It was as well known to him as it is to us that England had recently formed part of a great Scandinavian empire , and that there were Scandinavian princes whose claims were pressing and exigent . Indeed , the threat to Edward himself from this quarter had been persistent . It is permissible to surmise that , in 1047 , only the death of Magnus of Norway had prevented an invasion of England which might well have been successful , and in 105 8 the son of Harald Hardrada , king of Norway , attacked England with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attempt failed in its purpose , but it clearly foreshadowed the greater expedition which Harald Hardrada was himself to launch in l o66 . William 's policy towards England was thus always bound to take account of Scandinavia . Before 1066 it had , moreover , been given further precision not only by the developing strength of Normandy ( which we have watched ) but also by the duke 's changing position in the political structure of Gaul . In Io5o or shortly afterwards William made his famous marriage with Matilda daughter of Baldwin V count of Flanders . The lady was it seems of diminuWILLIAM // tive size , but she appears none the less to have been one of the few persons who were not overawed by her formidable husband , and on occasion she could act as regent for him . William on his part is stated to have been notoriously devoted to her so that she may have had some personal influence on his career . But it was the political implications of this match which were from the first important . The marriage took place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for this reason William 's relations with the papacy were to be strained for nearly a decade , until in 1059 Pope Alexander II sanctioned the marriage , and William and his wife in return undertook to build the two great monasteries in Caen which today commemorate them so worthily in stone . In 1050 , however , the marriage was chiefly significant as indicating the place which the young duke was beginning to win for himself among the greater fedatories of north-western Europe , and in fact the Flemish alliance was to persist until after the Norman conquest of England which it helped to make possible . It was not , however , until after Io6o that William 's position in Gaul began rapidly to be transformed and in such a manner as might vitally affect his relations with England . In that year the deaths of King Henry I and Count Geoffrey of Anjou freed him from his two most formidable opponents in France , while Philip I , the new king of France who was a boy , was placed under the tutelage of the duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count Walter of Maine , who was the Confessor 's nephew , removed a possible claimant to the English succession , and the acquisition of Maine itself by the duke of Normandy further altered the balance of political power in northern France to his advantage . The famous visit which Harold earl of Wessex made to Normandy , as it seems in 1064 , whatever may have been its motives , was to prove of even greater importance , since the resulting oath sworn by Harold to 62 ? DAVID C. DOUGLAS William was understood throughout western Europe as pledging the earl to support the claim of the duke to England , or at all events not to oppose it . Again , the successful Norman expedition against Brittany in the same year minimized the threat of resistance in the west , while the Northumbrian revolt of Io65 indicated what was to be the chief weakness of his principal adversary in England . When , therefore , on 5 January Io66 there occurred the death of the childless king of England , and on the very next day Earl Harold seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to its test at a time peculiarly favourable to its fulfilment . Political power , thus consistently developed , controlled and extended by a great duke , made it possible for the conquest of an ancient kingdom to be attempted . But it does not of itself suffice to explain tvhy the venture was undertaken ; nor does it account for its peculiar consequences . The crisis of Io66 is not to be viewed simply as a struggle between three princes contending for a throne ; and though a lust for plunder ( which was later to be abundantly sated ) undoubtedly fired the Norman followers of William , this does not by itself account for the consequences to England of the Norman conquest . Again , if the Norman success in arms derived in large measure from the recent increase of Norman power under Duke William , this alone can not explain the support which the duke received from outside Normandy , or for the ultimate results of the policy which he was to bring to fruition in England . The character of the propaganda which William employed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus also deserves examination in this respect . This propaganda , it will be recalled , was informed throughout by moral and ecclesiastical sentiments . The murder of Alfred Atheling in 1036 called ( it was said ) for divine vengeance on the son of his murWILLIAM // derer . Stigand , a schismatic archbishop , occupied the throne of St Augustine . The solemn promise of a venerated king had been abrogated , and a solemn oath sworn upon relics demanded the punishment of Heaven on the perjured usurper . We are not here concerned , of course , with the falsity or truth of these assertions . What is notable is firstly the character of William 's propaganda at this juncture , and secondly the extent to which it was accepted in western Europe . As is well known , the Norman case was successfully stated at Rome , and in the event William was to fight at Hastings under a papal banner and with consecrated relics round his neck . The Norman expedition had in fact been made to appear in the nature of a holy war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually considered as a triumph for William 's diplomacy , and this in truth it was . But it was a claim that was particularly attuned to contemporary Norman sentiments , and was indeed probably inspired by them . For the latter half of the eleventh century was emphatically the time when the notion of a holy war was continuously and widely exploited in Norman interests . Again and again the same theme was stressed . In 1059 the Normans Robert Guiscard and Richard of Capua , becoming vassals of the Holy See , had pledged themselves to its defence . In 1062 Pope Alexander II had given his blessing and a banner to Norman knights fighting in Sicily . In 1064 according to both French and Arab sources , the Normans were especially prominent in the crusade of Barbastro ' in Spain . In 1066 the same Alexander II gave William his blessing and a banner for the expedition to England . Between io6o and 1070 the Normans ( though with very diverse motives ) were achieving in Sicily what was in fact to prove the most important victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1070 William was to be solemnly proclaimed by papal legates at Winchester , and in 1072 while William was advancing into 64 ? DAVID C. DOUGLAS Scotland , Roger son of Tancred captured Palermo from the Saracens . These events were , moreover , closely connected , not only in time but also in spirit , for ( as must be emphasized ) they were conducted by men who were brothers and cousins of each other , and fully conscious of their relationship and their common purpose . William the Conqueror is said to have been wont to refresh his courage by contemplating the achievements of Robert Guiscard , and the name of Grandmesnil was as famous in Apulia as it was to become at Leicester . John , abbot of Fecamp , mediated between Pope Leo IX and Richard of Capua , while Geoffrey , bishop of Coutances , received from his relatives in Italy contributions towards the building of his cathedral at home . The Norman warriors of this age were avid of plunder and stained with brigandage , but they were none the less conscious of belonging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might , and also of its selfasserted Christian mission . Its exploits had before Io66 already stretched from Spain through Apulia to Constantinople , from Brittany to the Taurus , and they were soon to extend from Abernethy to Syracuse . Here was a vast zone of interconnected endeavour comparable even to that of the fabled Charlemagne in the Song of Roland . The sentiments it inspired coloured all Norman policy at this time . And , in a real sense , this far-flung extension of Norman power reached its climax in Sussex in October Io66 . William 's expedition to England in the autumn of io66 , the campaign which followed and the battle which was its culmination are to be described elsewhere in this book , as will also be the social and political consequences to England of the Norman conquest . The purpose of the foregoing remarks has been simply to indicate the extent to which William 's success in Io66 // may be related to what he had earlier achieved in the development of Norman power and policy . And it will now be further suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his rule as king may likewise be related to what he had previously achieved as duke . The interconnected movements which under William , as duke , had created the strength of Normandy in Io66 we have discovered to be aristocratic , ecclesiastical and ducal . The chief directions in which Norman influence was exercised in England during the reign of William as king may fairly be described as aristocratic , ecclesiastical and royal . The most striking social consequence of the Norman conquest was undoubtedly the aristocratic revolution which involved the tragic downfall of the Old-English nobility and its replacement by a new secular aristocracy imported from overseas . The magnitude of the change and the vast spoliation it involved are well documented , and they can be considered quite apart from the vexed question of the origins of feudal organization in England . Those members of the Old-English nobility which in Io66 escaped the slaughters of Fulford , Stamford Bridge and Hastings faced a bleak future as the defeated supporters of a lost cause , and they suffered further misfortunes in the early wars of William 's English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king might have been disposed to adopt towards them . The result was catastrophic . The collapse of the Old-English nobility was almost complete by the end of William 's reign . It has been estimated that in Io86 only about 8 per cent of the land of England remained in the possession of this class . It had ceased to be an integral part of English society . The substitution in its place of an aristocracy which was overwhelmingly Norman in origin has likewise been fully established . But the statement needs some qualification in that , even 66 ? DAVID C. DOUGLAS as the expedition had been widely supported in Europe , so also did many of the new holders of English lands come from outside Normandy . Flemings for instance were prominent among them , particularly perhaps in the north , and it was a man from Flanders , Gerbod , who , about 1070 became the first Earl of Chester . More important still were the Bretons who had followed the Conqueror to England . The great honour of Richmond ( Yorkshire ) with its 400 dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brittany , and it was a Breton , Ralph of Gael who , perhaps as early as io67 was made earl of Norfolk . The significance of the non-Norman element in the aristocracy set up by William in England should therefore not be minimized , but this was none the less always subordinate , and political events were soon to diminish its importance . The hostility of Flanders to the Anglo-Norman kingdom which grew after io67 immediately detracted from the Flemish influence on England , and Gerbod , earl of Chester , having fought in the battle of Cassel , disappeared from the English scene , and was replaced as earl by Hugh son of Richard , vicomte of Avranches . In like manner , the suppression of the rebellion of the earls in 1075 was said to have purged ' England from Breton influence , and while Ralph of Gael thereafter ceased to be earl of Norfolk , so also did Brian of Brittany then make way in Cornwall for the Conqueror 's half-brother Robert , count of Mortain . The aristocracy imposed upon England by William the Conqueror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aristocracy which had arisen in Normandy between 1040 and 1066 . By 1086 nearly half the land of England had passed into the possession of this class , and about half of this ( namely a quarter of the total ) had been given to only eleven men , of whom all but two were Normans who had been identified with the young duke during his early career . And the same is true of // the more important personages by whom they were surrounded : the representatives of the comital houses of Eu and Evreux ; Roger Bigot from Calvados ; Robert Malet from the neighbourhood of Evreux ; Robert and Henry the sons of Roger of Beaumont on the Risle . It is an impressive list , but while of course it could be supplemented , it could not be very widely extended . The important secular tenants of English lands in Io86 probably numbered less than two hundred . And from among these the greater men and the greater families stand out to testify to the manner in which the territorial wealth of England had been acquired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Normandy under Duke William . The cohesion which had earlier been achieved by this group in Normandy , and its association with William , were likewise to be reproduced in England . Indeed the Conqueror 's success in retaining his conjoint realm between Io66 and 1087 was due in no small measure to the maintenance of that unity of purpose between William and his magnates which had been attained in Normandy before the Conquest . After Io66 as before , it remained as much to the interest of these men as to the Conqueror himself that dissensions among them should not be allowed to develop . The rebellion of 1075 received no general support from the Norman nobility , and in 1079 elder members of the same aristocracy took common action to recall to their allegiance cadet members of their own families who had supported the revolt of the king 's son Robert against his father . It was a violent age dominated by the rivalries of highly competitive families . But a recognition of mutual obligations by the king and his magnates both in England and in Normandy assisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine its character . In ecclesiastical affairs also a similar relationship can be 68 ? DAVID C. DOUGLAS discerned between William 's reign in England and his previous rule of Normandy . The church in England between I070 and 1087 under the control of William was to experience great changes , many of which tended to make it conform more closely to the pattern which had previously taken shape in the Province of Rouen . Whether these changes were good or bad is not of course here in question : nor need it be debated whether the loss of a fine vernacular culture which was involved was compensated by a closer relation between England and those intellectual movements in western Europe which were con tributing to the renaissance of the twelfth century . The con nexion between the ecclesiastical development of Normandy and England during the Conqueror 's lifetime is however apparent . Between 1o66 and 1o87 the reformed monasteries of Normandy gave no less than twenty-two abbots and five bishops to England ; and even as William as duke had con-trolled the Norman church so also did he now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for the changes in England . All major appointments ( most of which were good ) were in practice in his hands , and the bishop rics of England were very generally in his time to assume the form they were to retain until the Reformation . Most notable of all was the royal participation in the work of ecclesiastical councils which now began to be a regular feature of church life in the kingdom as in the duchy . Thus , William took part in the councils at Winchester in 1070 , I072 and 1076 ; at Rouen in 1074 ; at Lillebonne in Io8o , and at Gloucester in Io85 . This was evidently a ruler who in the words of Professor Knowles was resolved of set purpose to raise the whole level of ecclesiastical discipline in his dominions ' . ' It was in fact the domination he sought to exercise over the church which in part explains his ambivalent attitude towards // the papacy . He had come to England with papal support ; he could claim with some justice to be the sponsor of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western church . But as in Normandy so also now in England he would not abandon the rights over the church which he held to be inherent in his office . The opposition was clear cut and fundamental ; it was to be productive of long-enduring controversies . But its implications during William 's lifetime should not be overstressed . In one respect William 's disputes with Gregory VII were concerned with the means by which might be implemented a policy of ecclesiastical reform which they shared in common . There was more co-operation than controversy between William and the papacy . Relations might be strained almost to breaking point , but the pope with whom William contended could none the less praise his zeal for religion . In conformity with the earlier growth of Normandy under Duke William the Norman impact upon England after ro66 was thus in the first instance to be aristocratic and ecclesiastical . It was , however , to be more specifically royal , in the sense that it was dependent upon the work of a duke who had become a king . The coronation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central event of his life : it fore-shadowed the character of his rule in England . By becoming a king , William assumed all the semi-sacred prestige which the men of the time were disposed to give to the royal office , and this had deep Norman implications since it could be easily related to the religious sanctions which had been so widely claimed for Norman enterprise . At the same time a wider gulf was placed between him and even the greatest of his followers , and he was thereby to be assisted in his endeavour to hold together as a single political entity his dominions on both sides of the Channel . As a sanctified king he could moreover exercise 70 ? DAVID C. DOUGLAS over the church a closer control with a greater appearance of legitimacy . And his position among the other secular rulers of western Europe was transformed . This was , however , only part of the matter . William in l o66 became not only a king : he became more specifically king of the English ( Rex Anglorum ) . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been employed in the coronation of English kings from at least the time of Edgar . As a result his Norman policy which we have watched was now brought into contact with a distinct complex of loyalties , some religious , some traditional , but all emotionally compelling . The policy itself thus at once began to be modified , and in the more practical sphere William was enabled to assume all the powers , and much of the prestige , which had formerly been vested in Old-English royalty . It was a mark of his astute appraisal of the situation that , from the start of his rule in England , he claimed to be the legitimate successor of Edward the Confessor . The reign of Harold II was treated as a usurpation ? as an interregnum . Such claims , exercised and developed at the hands of a man who was also a great constructive statesman , were in fact to entail remarkable and unexpected results . William was a conqueror ; his advent into England was a cause of spoilation ; in the English church and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , in many respects , William could also be considered as a conservative , and it was a mark of his political genius that he could adapt to his purpose the institutions of the land he had won by invasion . As Rex Anglorum he used the royal system of administration . His writs are substantially identical in form with those of Edward the Confessor , though they came soon to be couched in Latin rather than in the vernacular . He employed the sheriff as his chief executive officer in local government though the shrieWILLIAM // valty became progressively Norman in composition . He gave fresh vitality to the courts of shire and hundred , and he utilized ( with ruthless efficiency ) the taxational system that he found in this country . Most of his earliest charters were concerned to insist that the customs which had prevailed in the Confessor 's time should be respected , and this injunction was consistently to be repeated and very often enforced . In the great trials , which were so marked a feature of his reign , appeal was constantly made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that the great transference of landed property which the Conquest entailed was carried out without general anarchy . Even in the church , where the changes were very far-reaching , respect was paid to Old-English traditions , particularly with regard to the rights of the See of Canterbury . It was , in short , directly due to William himself ? the duke who had become a king ? and a king of the English ? that the Norman conquest proved almost as important for what it preserved as for what it created . It is assuredly no part of the purpose of this short essay to describe the constitutional and administrative history of England during the reign of William the Conqueror . But any estimate of William 's character and career must take note of the fact that what he wrought in England was accomplished in the midst of incessant warfare . The formation of the AngloNorman kingdom which was the immediate result of William 's victory altered the balance of political power in western Europe in such a manner as to provoke a continuous and relentless opposition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scandinavia and Scotland were immediately and directly effected , and William 's conjoint realm was in fact only to survive by means of an unremitting military effort which extended over two decades . 72 ? DAVID C. DOUGLAS Looking back on that prolonged defence , which was so strongly to affect the English future , its chief feature may well seem to have been the inherent inter-dependence of all its parts . The suppression of risings in England was always connected with the persisting threat of attack from Scandinavia or Scotland from Anjou or Maine , and the protection of the northern frontier beyond Yorkshire could never be dissociated from the active hostility which was manifested in France or Flanders or beyond the North Sea . It was , moreover , characteristic of this situation that after 1070 the attack directed against the AngloNorman realm should have been ever more closely co-ordinated by the astute diplomacy of Philip I of France whose object throughout was to disrupt the political union of Normandy and England ? which was in fact to be achieved for seventeen years after William 's death . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unity of the Anglo-Norman kingdom , must always have seemed to William to involve a single problem ; and the related campaigns of the king and his lieutenants had a common purpose , whether they were waged in Northumbria or Maine , or whether they were directed against Sweyn Estrithson of Denmark or Fulk le Rechin of Anjou , King Malcolm of Scotland or King Philip of France . The point perhaps deserves more emphasis than it always receives , and it could be plentifully illustrated . The claims of Edgar Atheling to the English throne were for instance to be sponsored successively by King Malcolm and King Philip . The rising of the north in 1069 ? 70 was supported by a fleet from Scandinavia which was to operate off the coast of England for four years . The revolt of Maine began almost simultaneously with the Yorkshire rebellion , and culminated in 1072 with the establishment of Fulk le Rechin at Le Mans . Again , in 1075 , the rebellion of the earls in England was led by a Breton earl of Norfolk , and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it initiated was continued in Brittany , and ended with William 's defeat at Dol ? a reverse which was to rob him of the initiative in France for a decade . Once again , the news of William 's repulse before the walls of Gerberoi in 1079 by King Philip and William 's son , Robert , had no sooner spread to Scotland than King Malcolm of Scotland raided Northumbria and started the rising which led to the murder of Bishop Walchere and the temporary collapse of Norman authority in the north . The same pattern of politics was in fact to persist until the end of the reign . It was entirely characteristic of the earlier defence of the Anglo-Norman realm that during the last twenty months of his life , William should have faced not only the threat of a combined attack from Scandinavia and Flanders ? from Cnut IV of Denmark and Count Robert of Flanders ? but that he should also have been constrained to conduct his final campaign on the south-eastern frontier of Normandy against the king of France . During these months , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Survey , and convoked the Salisbury Moot . But he met his lethal injury at Mantes in the Vexin , and early in the morning of 9 September 1087 he died within sound of the church bells of Rouen . At the close of this astonishing career it is tempting to contemplate the character of the extraordinary man who made it . To do so is not , however , easy , since such diverse judgements have been passed upon William , and he had no intimate biographer who could examine his motives , or probe his private thoughts . He must be judged by his acts , but his acts are sufficiently illuminating . They leave no doubt of his greatness , but they reveal also a man who was harsh and unlovable ? perhaps even personally repellent . Most of his life was spent in war , and war 74 ? DAVID C. DOUGLAS brought out what was brutal in this burly warrior whose physical strength ( until diminished by corpulence ) was exceptional , and who may have looked something like Henry VIII of England . His savagery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1052 were matched by those which he inflicted on Mantes in 1087 , and his devastation of the Home Counties in 1066 was a fit prelude to his harrying of the north in 1070 . Yet it may be questioned whether William , as a warrior , was more brutal than most of his contemporaries , or that he had a blunter sense of ethics or humanity than many of his successors in war down to the twentieth century . And if many of his acts in this respect can not be excused , they can at least be explained . The sack of Alencon made certain the bloodless surrender of Domfront ; the isolation of London in 1066 was based upon considered strategy ; and there were many occasions when William went out of his way ( as in Normandy in 1066 , and at Exeter in 1068 ) to prevent plundering by his troops . The horrible devastation of northern England in 1070 is in truth impossible to palliate , but it took place at a crisis when the Anglo-Norman kingdom was threatened from Northumbria and Scotland from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might perhaps be remarked that William was not the first ? nor the last ? king in England to lay waste a countryside for his sport . As a warrior , William was ( perhaps inevitably ) stained with blood . As a ruler , his avarice was notorious , and his taxation savage . He needed money for his government , and particularly for the numerous mercenaries he employed . The ruthlessness with which he extracted money from England must be set against the good administration he provided . Here , too , however , a balanced judgement is necessary . If William was stern beyond measure ' , there were many who benefited thereby . It was not for nothing that a panic spread among lesser folk when they heard of his death , for they were aware of the // disorders which were likely to follow his passing , and it was an Englishman who knew him , who , at the last , after lamenting his harshness , paid tribute to the good order he maintained . Ruthless in war , he was not a bloodthirsty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrant . Contemporaries found him a man to fear , but also a man to respect . The basis of his achievement was his genius for leadership . Reference is often made to the good fortune which he sometimes enjoyed , as in the deaths of his two chief rivals in France in io6o , and in certain of the circumstances of 1066 . But no reference to luck can possibly be adequate to explain a career of this character , or an achievement of this magnitude . There must have been a wonderful strength of personality in this man who could rise from his bastard beginnings to such power , and who could elicit from the hard-faced men who surrounded him , both in Normandy and England , such a constant measure of support . He was harsh and rapacious , personally pious , courageous in adversity , and indomitably tenacious of purpose . He could suit his policy to opportunity ; but his will was inflexible , and his energy was untiring . Thus between 1051 and 1054 , when in his middle twenties , he captured Alencon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great invasion by the French king , held an important ecclesiastical council and deposed an Archbishop of Rouen . Again , at a later stage of his career , only a matter of months elapsed between his invasion of Scotland late in 1072 and his campaign in Maine in the next year . He was ever on the move , and if both his vices and his virtues were exceptional , so also were the conditions in which his life was spent . His vigorous leadership pervaded his whole career , and not least the last two years of his life when so much was accomplished . This quality alone made possible not only his survival as duke , but also the existence and preservation of the Anglo-Norman kingdom , 76 ? DAVID C. DOUGLAS which he established . As Professor Southern has justly re-marked , he had an unrivalled mastery of the problems of the secular world ? that is to say of other men 's wills ? in both fighting and ruling unapproached in creative power by any other medieval ruler after Charlemagne ' .1 It would , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queror a place among the greatest monarchs of the Middle Ages . He stands four-square , a dominant figure against the background of his own fascinating and tumultuous age . As a warrior he was widely renowned , and probably justly , for if his later campaigns in France were undistinguished , his earlier siege operations in Maine were notable , and in the great enterprise of I o66 his patience , his organization and his generalship were surely of the highest order . But it is above all for his constructive statesmanship that he commands attention ; and here his achievement must appear all the more remarkable when it is recalled that his ceaseless preoccupation with the problems of government was coupled with ceaseless campaign ing . The results of his rule had enduring consequences which stretched even beyond the confines of his own wide dominions . He adapted his policy to a crisis which , in his time , affected Scandinavia and Italy , France and England ; and the develop ment of western Europe in the Middle Ages was substantially affected by what he accomplished . In Normandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . To England he gave a new aristocracy and a reconstituted church . At the same time , he was concerned to respect the traditions of the country he conquered , and he revitalized many of its ancient institu tions . He made his own contribution to the highly individual character of medieval England , and Anglo-Norman history in the eleventh century can not be appraised without reference to his characteristic acts . III ? The Campaign of 1o66 fter the coronation of King Harold , and the appearance of Halley 's Comet , the next episode depicted on the Bayeux Tapestry is the arrival of a ship in Normandy . The date must have been about io January 1o66 . The ship carries a crew of three and an individual who seems to be in a hurry to disembark . He was a messenger , doubtless one of the many Normans living in England ; and he brought the astounding news that Edward the Confessor had died on 5 January and that Harold Godwinson had been crowned king of England the very next day . The messenger found Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the very act , so it is said , of drawing his bow . William returned at once to his hall , where he is reported to have given the matter long and anxious thought , which resulted in his sending an embassy to Harold on 15 January . From the various conflicting accounts nothing definite can be stated about the terms either of William 's message or of Harold 's answer ; but it may be surmised that the former was a challenge of Harold 's right to the crown , and the latter its summary rejection . The mission was fruitless , Harold 's accession was a fait accompli and the matter had passed beyond negotiation . From that moment William must have realized that nothing short of a successful full-scale invasion of England could ever place the crown of that country on his head . A full-scale invasion of England , however , would be far 82 ? CHARLES H. LEMMON beyond anything which he had hitherto attempted . Normans , it is true , had carried out overseas expeditions before , notably to Sicily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries where they were far outnumbered by the native population ; but this expedition would necessarily have to be on a larger scale , and the potential odds against its success would be greater . The English possessed fighting forces which were by no means negligible : a few thousand highly-trained professional Housecarls , probably the finest soldiers in Europe , backed by a Fyrd , or national militia , the potential strength of which , since every five hides of land had to produce one man , might be as high as 48,000 . That the landing would be opposed was only to be expected . Julius Caesar , with two legions comprising about io , 000 highly-trained professional soldiers , carried in ninety-eight transports and escorted by armed triremes , had only landed with difficulty , could not establish himself in the island and was lucky to be able to re-embark . With an inadequate number of purely Norman troops , and without means of transporting an army across the Channel , the difficulties of invading England might well seem insuperable to many on whose support of the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties , the project , from a strategic point of view , exceeded any prudent degree of calculated risk ' . William could not hope to raise sufficient men and ships without outside help ; but first he had to deal with his own barons , who might consider themselves not bound by their feudal tenure to follow him overseas for the purpose of making him king of England . His first step was therefore to lay the matter before fourteen of his relations and most trusted councillors . This inner council approved the purpose of the expedition and pledged their support ; but considered that the concurrence of all the barons of Normandy was necessary . Such a // meeting was convened at Lillebonne . After reciting his rights , and the wrongs which Harold had done , William attempted to bounce the assembly by saying that he would not ask whether they would help him in such a cause . He took their zeal and loyalty for granted ; and he asked only how many ships and men each would bring as a freewill offering . The barons did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of objections , and eventually the meeting broke up in disorder . Thereafter there followed a demonstration of that indefinable power which has been given from time to time to military commanders who have differed widely in personality : the power to draw men to them who will accept their leadership with complete confidence , and follow them wherever they may lead . William interviewed each baron separately : an arduous task , as the number must have exceeded one hundred . One by one they yielded to his persuasions , and agreed not only to serve him in his enterprise , but on this occasion , for once , to double their normal feudal obligations . Immediately each baron had given his promise a clerk entered in a book the number of ships and men that he would supply . The net was then spread more widely ; and William invited soldiers from every quarter to come as volunteers , offering them the spoils of the campaign as an inducement . His negotiations with rulers of states are somewhat obscure : apparently he met King Philip of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king of Denmark , and approached his father-in-law , Baldwin of Flanders . Neither Philip nor Baldwin would , as rulers , give any help ; but the fact remains that a large number of volunteers came from both their states ; and these , with those collected by Eustace , count of Boulogne , brother-in-law of Edward the Confessor , were formed into a division under the command of the Norman , Roger of Montgomerie . The most that William seems to have obtained from the emperor 84 ? CHARLES H. LEMMON was a promise not to hinder recruitment of volunteers in the Empire , and from the king of Denmark his neutrality . The latter was apparently not kept , as Danish volunteers are said to have formed part of Harold 's army . From Brittany , the neighbouring and nominally vassal state , came the largest contingent of troops which was not Norman ; and these were organized as a division under the command of Alan Fergant , cousin of Conan , the reigning count . It has been suggested that the eagerness of the Celtic Bretons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ancestors whom the Saxons had driven from the island . With Pope Alexander II William obtained signal success . His cause was pleaded by the archdeacon of Lisieux on the grounds of Harold 's alleged perjury . A conclave was held , at which I-Iarold was declared a usurper , and William the lawful successor of Edward the Confessor . The pope bestowed his blessing on the expedition , sending William a consecrated banner . In effect , he made the expedition a crusade ; which greatly aided the recruitment of the expeditionary force . Individual recruits now came in from many lands ? mostly soldiers of fortune and mere adventurers attracted by the hope of plunder . It would be from these that the mercenary men-at-arms and archers were enrolled . Norman armies in the past had consisted almost entirely of cavalry ; but this time , it is clear from passages in the chronicles , owing to the difficulty of transporting horses , a large proportion had of necessity to be archers and heavy infantry ; a form of service which was beneath the dignity of knights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the army , and the next scene is headed Here Duke William ordered ships to be built . We are shown how his orders were carried out , the trees being felled , the planks being cut and stacked , the shipwrights at work and the finished ships being launched by block and // tackle . Shipbuilding occupied the summer of 1066 until about 12 August , when those completed were assembled at the port of Dives . The number promised had been 752 ; but Wace states that his father told him there were only 696 . Wace , the poet who wrote the Roman de Rou a century after the event , is not a reliable military historian ; but his figure , the lowest of any chronicler , is credible , and General James used it as a basis to estimate the strength of the forces which crossed the Channel . Other sources James used were Eccleston 's Antiquities , which gives details of the English overseas expeditions of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries when the largest ships carried only forty-four men , the chroniclers ' lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five of the twelve ships shown carry horses . His findings , published in the Royal Engineers ' Journal for January 1907 , were that 400 of the ships each carried nine men with horses , and that the remaining 296 ships each carried an average of twenty-five dismounted men , making his total estimate 11,000 men , which would include sailors , sutlers and camp followers , as the number carried across the channel . Sir James Ramsay 's esti mate in 1898 had been Io , 000 ; and William 's boast to Robert the son of Wymarc may not be without significance : If I had only Io , 000 men , such as the 6o,000 I have , I would still go on . ' The ships specially built for the expedition must be regarded rather as landing craft ' than troop transports . They could have been hardly the size of coastal fishing boats , and more akin to the Prames ' on which Bonaparte hoped to carry his invading troops across the channel , though even these carried eighty men each . They were much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legionaries . A curiosity of the ship-building programme is that no warships ' or armed vessels to serve as escort are mentioned . Caesar protected his transports with armed triremes ; while Bonaparte cancelled all his invasion 86 ? CHARLES H. LEMMON plans because he could not achieve command of the sea . Harold 's fleet was in the channel during the Norman shipbuilding ; though it was , as it happened , withdrawn before the invasion . William attempted no blockade and took a big risk in ignoring command of the sea . Ships such as those shown on the Bayeux Tapestry must have needed the wind very nearly astern ; so that to sail across the channel from Dives a due south wind , which is rather unusual , was necessary . The wind blew obstinately from the west for a whole month ; at the end of which time , about 1z September , William decided to use it to sail up the coast to St Valery at the mouth of the Somme , whence the fleet would have a shorter passage , and be able to cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oo miles of coast must have been hazardous ; for William of Poitiers records terrible shipwrecks ' . One would hardly suppose that the whole army was embarked for this move : the cavalry at least would have marched . In England , the Fyrd , or militia , had been keeping watch on the south coast all through the summer . The number assigned to this task is unlikely to have been more than one quarter of the potential strength of the Fyrd in the whole country , or say 1 z , 000 . Of these , each individual could be called up , when there was no fighting to be done , for two months only . On 8 September the supply of fyrdmen must have run out ; for on that date , only a few days before the Norman fleet moved to St Valery , the last elements of the Fyrd were disembodied . The theory that the fyrdmen were required to help with the harvest is hardly tenable ; because on 14 September , which is the New Style equivalent of their disembodiment date , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed . At the same time , the fleet was sent to London and paid off ; and nothing definite can be gleaned from the chronicles that it // ever met the Norman fleet in combat , or interfered with the invasion . Then a heavy blow fell . On or about 15 September , Harald Hardrada , king of Norway , landed at Riccal on the bank of the Yorkshire Ouse . His shadowy claim to the English throne was based on an alleged agreement in 1038 between his predecessor Magnus and Harthacnut , king of Denmark , before the latter had become king of England . On zo September he heavily defeated the northern earls Edwin and Morcar at the battle of Fulford . Intelligence was good in medieval warfare ; and Harold may quite possibly have heard , in London , at some time from 18 September to the loth , both of the Norwegian landing and of the increased threat arising from the Norman change of embarkation port . He must have issued immediate orders for the re-embodiment of the Fyrd , and left London with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Tadcaster on 24 September . News of the defeat of Edwin and Morcar must have reached him while on the march ; but although his Housecarls , numbering at most 3,000 , could have received but little reinforcement from the Fyrd , owing to shortness of time , he pushed on at the high march-rate of nearly forty miles a day along the Roman road to York expecting to find the Norwegians there . Actually , for no very apparent reason , they had moved out to Stamford Bridge eight miles further on ; where Harold fell upon them on 25 September and destroyed almost their entire army . Harald Hardrada and his own renegade brother Tostig were killed ; and the victorious army , which itself had suffered heavy casualties , then returned to York to rest and celebrate . The weather on the other side of the Channel was cold and wet , and the wind remained in the west until 27 September , when it suddenly changed to the east . The ships were loaded and the troops embarked with all speed . The Bayeux Tapestry 88 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swords and lances being carried down to the ships ; while provisions are also indicated by men carrying a ham and a barrel . A curious hand-wagon , which we are told carried both wine and arms , is an example , perhaps , of the combined Ordnance and Supply vehicles which accompanied the forces . The sun set at 5.34 pm that day , and the crescent moon ( six days old ) also set at about 9.15 pm , so that it was necessary to be out on the open sea by 6.3o pm . William ordered a masthead light to be hoisted on every ship , that the ships should keep together and that all should heave-to for a while in the middle of the night . The reason for the latter was that the period of darkness was too long for both the embarkation and the landing to be made in daylight . The order to set sail again after the heave-to was given by hoisting a masthead light on Mora , the duke 's flagship , and by the sounding of trumpets . How the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor how the ships managed to keep together on a moonless night without frequent collisions and consequent damage . Wind and sea conditions appear to have been ideal ; it began to get light again about 5 am and the sun rose at 6.4 am . William 's flagship , which had been given him by his wife Matilda , had outdistanced the rest of the fleet and had to heave-to again ; some anxiety being caused until a lookout at the masthead reported ships in view . The voyage continued , and the English coast was reached at Pevensey Level about 8.3o am . So ended this very remarkable voyage which for its boldness of conception , the magnitude of the task involved and the efficiency with which it was carried out with the primitive shipping of the eleventh century , does not seem to have received the recognition as an operation of war which it undoubtedly deserves . Only two vessels were lost ; one of which , at least , must have come ashore , as recorded , at Romney in Kent , where the // inhabitants killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perished the official southsayer of the expedition who , the duke declared , was not much loss , as he had been unable to predict his own fate . While the chroniclers leave little doubt that the Norman fleet reached the coast near Pevensey , their accounts of the landing and subsequent movements of troops are obscure and conflicting ; so that it is necessary to consider how the land probably lay in Io66 before a reconstruction can be made . Pevensey Level , ' formed by the combined effect of the great thaw after the last Ice Age , and the west to east sea drift , is now a roughly semi-circular plain about six miles in diameter , mostly of grazing land intersected by drainage channels and separated from the sea by a high bank of shingle . Although in the thirteenth century the sea flowed freely over it , there were , two centuries earlier , as Domesday Book shows , large culti vated areas , like those still to be seen on the Essex coast , which became islands in an expanse of shallow water at high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flats and winding water channels , across which causeways had probably been built . Into this area a peninsula projects from the western side . It is three miles long , and behind it in Io66 , as in Roman times , lay a sheltered harbour . On the point of this peninsula the Romans had built the fortress of Anderida , whose walls still stand to a height of z 5 feet , and the Saxons the seaport and market town of Pevensey , which was small but important enough to levy harbour dues . A Roman road westward to Lewes and London provided the sole communication inland . In io66 a ship entering Pevensey harbour would first pass through a wide gap in the shingle bank , then follow the chan nel through the tidal mud-flats , round the peninsula , and cast anchor in the harbour close under the north walls of Anderida 90 ? CHARLES H. LEMMON ( now Pevensey Castle ) . The chroniclers are generally agreed that the duke himself landed at Pevensey at the third hour ' which , as time is now reckoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , states that disembarkation took place at intervals along the shore ; and another that the invaders seized the shore of the sea , thus indicating landings on the shingle bank , where it would have been easy to run ships ashore to land infantry , but difficult to disembark the horses . Unfortunately the portion of the tapestry which shows the landing of horses gives no clue to the method employed . ( See illustration , plate 5a . ) We may suppose that the ships carrying the duke , with such cavalry as accompanied him , as well as the troops detailed to garrison Pevensey , entered the harbour , where there may have been wharves ; and that the remainder were run ashore at various points along the shingle bank and beach towards Hastings . Again there is general agreement among the chroniclers that the duke moved his army to Hastings with very little delay . As the shingle bank would provide the inhabitants with a means of crossing the marsh , one presumes that there was some track behind it whereby troops landing on it eastward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is now called Cooden , and then march to Hastings . Those , however , who landed on the western side of the harbour , or at Pevensey itself , would have to cross to the eastern side . The usually accepted theory is that they marched around the whole perimeter of Pevensey Level , a distance of twenty-six miles . While several villages near the northern edge of the Level were undoubtedly devastated , this could have been done by raiding parties , and does not prove that any large part of the army passed that way ; nor would the duke have been likely to divide his forces in that manner . William of Poitiers records an incident which may have a bearing on the question . Immediately after landing , William carried out a // reconnaissance accompanied by not more than twenty-five men . The by-paths were so rough that they had to dismount , and William himself carried the corslets of two of his companions , presumably because they were exhausted . Since the Roman road to Lewes , the sole link with the mainland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incident suggests two things : firstly , that William did not plan to march inland by the Lewes road ; and secondly , that he searched without success among the rough tracks leading to islands in the marsh for a way round the end of the harbour by which to unite his army and march to Hastings . There is a possible alternative to a march around the perimeter of the marsh , which is that after the garrison of Pevensey had been installed , the rest of the troops who had landed there , not many in number , re-embarked , dropped down the river with the tide and proceeded to Hastings by rowing if the wind did not serve . The bulk of the cavalry could either have been ordered beforehand to make the port of Hastings if possible ; or the horses could have been left aboard their transports in harbour until the result of the reconnaissance was known . Although the Saxon army was unable to offer any opposition to the Norman landing , on account of the withdrawal of the Fyrd , an excellently organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Norman landing was observed and the news transmitted z6o miles to York , where Harold received it three days afterwards , on 1 October . With the depleted ranks of his Housecarls , and such Fyrd as had either fought in the battle or had come in since , he set out for London , presumably on the 2nd , and , moving at nearly forty miles a day , reached it on the 6th . All bodies of militia met on the way would be ordered to turn about , and messages would be left for those which might arrive later . This march was a fine achievement ; but its speed was not phenomenal for medieval // warfare , and it is clear from passages in the Chronicles that the Housecarls , though they always fought on foot , were in effect mounted infantry , and rode horses on the march , as did also probably a proportion of the Fyrd . In London Harold remained for five full days to assemble the militia due to join there , and to allow those he had outdistanced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to examine the Saxon and Norman armies . The army commanded by King Harold II , the last of the Saxon kings , was composed of men of Anglian , Saxon , Jutish and Danish blood , and also , as some say , of native Danes and Welsh . It was composed of two elements , the Housecarls and the Fyrd . The Housecarls , a royal bodyguard instituted by Cnut , were professional men-at-arms who were dressed in short close-fitting leather jerkins , on which iron rings were sewn , trousers bound with thongs , and sandals . They wore their hair long , and their heads were covered by steel caps with nasal pieces and long leather flaps which fell over the shoulders . They carried pointed shields made of lime wood , which measured about 36 inches by 15 inches . Their principal weapon was the long Danish battleaxe , with which a horse and rider could be cut down at a blow ; but the axe men had to be supported by swordsmen and javelin throwers , and they probably fought in combat groups like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were noted for their perfect drill in action . After supplying a bodyguard for the king , their chief function in battle was to stiffen the ranks of the Fyrd . The Fyrd- , the old constitutional force of the country , was formed in the reign of King Alfred , and has existed as some form of militia down to the present day , the last unit being the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers . The inhabitants of each five hides of land were responsible for providing one soldier for the Fyrd for two months in each year , with twenty shillings for his pay and // rations . The Fyrd was dressed mostly in leather jerkins and caps , and only a few wore chain-covered shirts . Most carried a small round shield ; but the supply seems to have been inadequate , for we read that shields were improvised from window shutters and other pieces of wood ' . Their arms consisted of spears , short axes , bills , scythes , javelins , slings to hurl stones and stone-headed hammers . A very few of them were archers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For some reason these irregular troops of the Saxon army have been represented as a rabble of ill-armed peasantry picked up at hazard , which is quite untrue . While , no doubt , the equipment and experience of the Fyrd may have left much to be desired , and made them inferior in quality to the Norman men-at-arms , they were an organized force of undoubted courage . The Bayeux Tapestry gives an erroneous impression of the appearance of the Saxon army by showing the Housecarls in Norman uniform , and the Fyrd in the dress of Norman camp followers . The Norman military system was feudal . Each baron equipped for service a number of knights , esquires and retainers , as a condition of holding his land . These were mounted , wore mail armour or hauberks to the knees and steel helmets which gave protection to the nose . They were armed with lances , swords and maces , carried kite-shaped shields , and were a skilled and disciplined force of cavalry . The infantry of the Norman army consisted of paid men-at-arms , who wore either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caps . They wore sandals and their legs were bound with thongs . They were armed with short axes , spears , daggers and broadswords , and their discipline was good . The archers ? the artillery of the army ? were armed with the short bow , which had an effective range of ioo , and an extreme range of Igo yards . There were no crossbows , as they were not introduced into western Europe until later . 94 . CHARLES H. LEMMON The strategic aspects of the campaign and the characters of the two commanders may ; now be considered . It is debatable whether there was any pact between William and Harald Hardrada for a simultaneous invasion , for they had met not long before ; or whether Harald Hardrada forestalled William . To Harold , however , it would make no difference ; for he was confronted by a two-pronged attack , and had the difficult decision to make whether to attack the Norwegians , who had actually landed , or to concentrate his forces south of London in view of the increased threat of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the right decision in the circumstances is hardly open to question . On landing , William can have obtained little or no information of the whereabouts of the Saxon army until a messenger arrived from Robert son of Wymarc , a Norman who lived in the neighbourhood . This messenger is shown on the tapestry ; and he brought the news of the battle of Stamford Bridge , a warning that William could not hope to defeat Harold , and the advice that he should give up his enterprise and return to Normandy . William 's answer was to boast of the strength of his army , and add , I would fight with Harold as soon as possible . ' This answer puts William 's intention beyond doubt , and shows that he appreciated that the destruction of the enemy 's armed forces in the field is much more important than the capture of a locality , however politically desirable that may be . This principle of war has been a fruitful source of dissension between heads of state and their military commanders in recent times ; but William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear ; it was the Saxon army which , at the moment , was somewhere north of London . Harold and William differed widely , as good generals often do , in their qualities . Harold was impetuous , bold , quick , resolute ; but kind , affable and much concerned with the welfare // of his followers and subjects . William was cool , careful , calculating and ruthless ; but swift to take advantage of an adversary 's mistake . He was a good strategist and tactician . Knowing that the longer battle was delayed the stronger Harold would become ; that to seek him in the interior would mean a long campaign for which his forces were insufficient to keep open communications with the coast ; and that defeat in the interior would mean annihilation , his knowledge of Harold 's psychology suggested the means of achieving his object . A systematic destruction of villages in the coastal area would provide just the necessary stimulus to bring Harold down to the coast where he wanted him , with whatever troops he had with him at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William 's intention was to deliver his blow before any more enemy troops could arrive . While this plan was being put into operation it is unlikely that he would surrender his freedom of manoeuvre by keeping his troops down by the shore at Hastings . Some position on the Baldslow Ridge , just north of Hastings , seems to be indicated , from which daily foraging and incendiary parties could be sent out . The destruction of some twenty villages around Hastings is either directly mentioned in Domesday Book , or can be deduced from the drop from pre-Conquest to post-Conquest values recorded therein . Some villages mentioned are unidentifiable and may never have been rebuilt . Harold 's plan was simple : to destroy the Norman army as he had just destroyed the Norwegians , and had defeated Gruffyth ap Llewelyn at Ruddlan in Io63 , by effecting surprise through the speed of his advance . Surprise is a most potent factor in war ; and the conclusion that he intended to use the same technique against William seems inescapable . Roads have always exercised a powerful influence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of Roman // roads , doubtless in bad repair , and prehistoric trackways , some of which the Romans had metalled . Other ways were local tracks , unmetalled for the most part , which in Sussex were particularly founderous , and quite unsuitable for the rapid march of an army . The Roman road from Hastings to Rochester and London crossed , at Sedlescombe , the River Brede , which derives its name from its former breadth , and is known to have remained very broad and tidal at that point as late as the sixteenth century . There , in ro66 , the crossing must have been made by ferry , just as travellers on Indian trunk roads have to cross rivers today . This would have rendered that portion impracticable for an army ; but it could be completely avoided by taking a prehistoric trackway which ran along the ridge to the north of Hastings as far as Caldbec Hill ( on the northern outskirts of Battle ) . There the trackway forked ; and by taking the right-hand branch and passing around the source of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while by taking the left-hand branch access could be gained to the Lewes ? London Roman road in the neighbourhood of Maresfield . From Harold 's point of view , therefore , Caldbec Hill was a strategic point which the Norman army must pass if it marched inland ; it was a nodal point of communications ; it wassituated at a suitable distance from Hastings to enable him to pounce on his enemy just as he had pounced on Hardrada from Tadcaster ; and , in case William attacked him first , it was covered by an excellent defensive position . Harold appointed The Hoar Apple Tree ' as a rendezvous ; and when it is learnt that the boundaries of three Hundreds met close to Caldbec Hill , and that there are fourteen known examples of apple trees having been planted at such spots , it can be said with some certainty that Caldbec Hill was the appointed rendezvous . Caldbec Hill is only seven miles from Hastings ; and the 98 ? CHARLES H. LEMMON thought that Harold was about to commit the strategic blunder of attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in the mind of Gyrth , his brother , when he urged him not to lead his army against William , and offered to take command himself . A much sounder plan for Harold would have been to concentrate his forces on the North Downs , where he could command both the roads by which William could advance into the interior . If William refused to be drawn into the interior , Harold , having collected all his troops , could then have advanced and crushed him with superior numbers . Harold , however , was obdurate , and marched the Saxon army out of London , presumably on 12 October , and arrived at Caldbec Hill late on the 13th . The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle remarks tersely that Harold came from the north , and fought against William before all his army had come up . We can pass over the numerous messages , culminating in a challenge to single combat , which are said to have been exchanged between Harold and William . Whether truth or fiction they form the usual stylised prelude to a medieval account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering position selected by Harold , which was to become the battlefield , is a remarkable piece of ground , which , like the field of Naseby , is a watershed . From Caldbec Hill ( 3 50 feet ) a neck of land , on which Battle High Street now stands , runs southwards flanked by rapidly falling ground . Just south of the abbey ( 275 feet ) this narrow ridge dips suddenly to a height of 213 feet at the railway station approach , forming , not a valley as so many accounts state , but a saddle with a valley beginning on either side of it . Two streams , rising about zoo yards apart , flow in opposite directions down the two valleys , which must have been very marshy in 1066 . At the point where the watershed begins to dip , a fairly level cross-ridge // extends from Battle Primary School on the east to the top of the Stumblets , beyond the abbey gardens , on the west . Coming from Hastings , the prehistoric trackway , following the watershed , ran across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-ridge obliquely at about its middle . The chroniclers describe the battle as having been fought in plans Hastinges , which in medieval Latin meant in the unwooded country ( and not in the plains ) about Hastings ; from which it is easy to see how the contracted designation battle of Hastings arose . The battlefield was in fact about one mile from the forest edge , and the top of the ridge was probably rough untilled ground ; but from Domesday Book it can be deduced that the eastern slopes , as also the southern slopes with land extending southward therefrom , were cultivated . The latter area was called Santlache and consisted chiefly of a detached portion of the Saxon manor of Bollington by Bulverhythe . The meaning of Santlache is doubtful ; it may be sandy area ' . The Norman effort to pronounce it , or mere punning , produced Sanguelac and Senlac , meaning blood lake ' , which has achieved a certain popularity , especially in France , as a name for the battle . On this Santlache ridge Harold formed up his troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commander 's post be so accurately located ; since by William 's orders the high altar of the abbey church was built on the exact spot . This place where Harold took up his position under his two standards , the Dragon of Wessex and the Fighting Man , is precisely where a medieval commander might be expected to have his command post . It was on the highest point of the ridge , about the centre of his line , and at the point where the prehistoric trackway from the coast was crossed by a local track called the Wasingate , which is now represented eastwards by Marley Lane , and can still be traced westwards as a track and avenue to Park Farm . By forming up his troops about fifty yards in front of his command
