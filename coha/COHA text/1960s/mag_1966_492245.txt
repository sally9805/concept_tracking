T he first thing we do . " says Dick the Butcher in Shakespeare 's Henry VI . " let 's kill all the lawyers . " It is a solution that has on occasion appealed to Americans , too . When George Washington was dying . he refused to let a lawyer anywhere near his will , and ordered that any dispute about it should be settled out of court by three arbitrators , During the early years of the 19th century , while Chief Justice John Marshall was making the Supreme Court the arbiter of American political destiny , the citizenry in market towns all over the country fought to destroy law as a profession . Nearly all the New England States passed laws requiring the courts to allow anyone . with or without legal training , to represent any one else and collect fees for his services .

" You can hire logic , in the shape of a lawyer , to prove anything you want to prove , " wrote Oliver Wendell Holmes . poet , doctor and father of a great judge ; and if these were the sentiments of New England , the attitudes of the West were unprintable .

Not everyone likes it . even now Clergymen . artists , political radicals criticize the law , because they know people would get on together if only ? The lawyer knows that there is no only , that people do n't get on . and that the need is for a structure to control the damage done by their disagreements . And while the law inevitably expresses and serves the interests of those who are already powerful , it is also the only known device by which power can be constrained . " Disputes .

In every generation , from Erskine defending Tom Paine to James B. Donovan defending the Russian spy Rudolf Abel . there have been conservative lawyers who have risked a profitable commercial practice to guarantee a decent trial to people whose unpopularity could easily rub off on their counsel . Even Sandburg made an exception for Lincoln . After teaching . law is the largest profession  --  almost 300,000 licensed practitioners , 200.000 of them working as lawyers . Nearly 10.000 judges are on one form or another of the public payroll . 500 of them as " appellate court " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are employed full time listening to the arguments of lawyers who wish to protest or confirm the decisions of the court which first heard the case . According to the public-opinion polls , the job of appellate court judge has the highest prestige of any occupation in America . The American legal system is the most complicated ever devised by the wit of man , and very few statements can be made which will accurately describe the law throughout the United States . The 50 states are separate sovereignties. each an independent jurisdiction in handling questions of contract . ownership , wills , crime , civil wrongs  --  the bulk of the matters which concern the law , Lawyers qualify to practice in their own state ; to practice elsewhere they have to satisfy another committee of the purity of their characters . and in many cases take another bar exam .

Each state has different statutory laws , and a different body of decided cases , to handle such accidents . This particular problem is now easy because it comes up so often , but some of the questions of Conflict of Jurisdiction and Conflict of Laws are incredibly labyrinthine . In recent years American lawyers have been working more and more with the problems of their clients ' European subsidiaries , an area which the Europeans call " private international law " and regard as one of the most abstruse of legal specialties . For the American lawyers . it 's altogether normal ; they deal with " private international law " every day for every client who does business in more than one state .

This " de.crsity jurisdiction " was created ratt by the Constitution but by the Judiciary Act of 1789 , and presumably it could he taken away tomorrow by simple act of Congress . Until recently , most lawyers and judges thought it Amid be taken away . The original justification , that people from other states could not get a fair trial before juries who were the home folks of their opponents , looked ludicrous ; federal judges , since 1938. have been under orders to make their decisions according to the law that would apply in the state court , and juries in both courts are locals .

Ultimately , quite apart from technical questions of jurisdiction , the federal Constitution is " the law of the land . " The Supreme Court under Marshall successfully asserted its power to review decisions of the highest courts of the states , provided a " federal question " had been raised  --  and the final arbiter of whether or not a case raises a " federal question " is the Supreme Court itself . Operating first under the " interstate commerce " clause of the Constitution , and then under the " due process " clause of the 14th Amendment , the federal courts have found increasing numbers of " federal questions " in appeals from judgments of the state courts . Periodically the state courts rebel . A " pastoral letter " from the Chief Judge of New Jersey to his lower courts in the summer of 1965 instructed them to ignore a ruling by a Federal Court of Appeals on the admissibility of confessions ( federal courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last decade ) . Last July . the Court of Appeals of New York State flatly refused , briefly , to permit an election for the state legislature on a new apportionment that had been approved by a bench of three federal district judges but which was in clear violation of the state constitution . The federal district judges took the only conceivable " maybe " out of their order , and the New York courts backed away . One of the lawyers defending the position of the New York courts made the parting comment , " You have just seen federal supremacy in hying color .

As early as the 1830 's , de Tocqueville described the lawyers as the American aristocracy . By virtue of its importance in the society , the law drew and still draws a disproportionate share of the national intelligence to its service . In this century , the lawyers have become virtually a dominant caste . They permeate American political life . Almost 60 percent of our Congressmen and almost 7 ( 1 percent of our Senators are lawyers ; and the proportion has been fairly stable since the turn of the century .

" Experience and training have given the lawyers what Judge Learned Hand once called ' a bathtub mind " ? they can fill their heads with the facts immediately necessary . then pull the plug . scour away all recollection of the last matter . and refill for the new situation . The best of them are fantastically educable : Dean , for example , once got deep enough into Japanese law and culture to invent a type of Japanese mortgage which would make Japanese securities safe investments for American institutions . And they are immensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of viable compromise . As Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote in 1941 . " Struggles over power that in Europe call out regiments of troops , in America call out battalions of Lawyers . " The streams of lawyers who flow through Washington as Assistant Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries form an American substitute for the highly trained and professional civil servants who actually run all the other governments of the western world . A schoolboy 's misquotation of John Adams put the matter precisely a generation ago : " We have a government of lawyers , not of men . " Because no major business decision can be made without considering the " tax consequences " and the " antitrust consequences , " lawyers are also valuable members of the boards of directors of most big corporations . Most companies of any size not only " retain " a firm of lawyers to make sure they can successfully negotiate with governments and with other corporations but they also support an inside " legal department . " This situation has long been a source of unhappiness in the profession . " Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a century ago . " Now clients have lawyers . " t The nation 's charitable and cultural enterprises , too , rely heavily on law'y'ers : they chair the boards of the museums , the libraries , the symphony orchestras and the universities . In a sense , the lawyer is the original public-relations man  --  by training and function , he sees how corporate actions will look to outsiders . Most of the men who operate on this exalted level come from one of the big law firms which are a uniquely American contribution to a universal profession . About 50 such firms , half in New York and half outside , offer the services of 50 or more lawyers  --  who are not , however . " lawyers " as the television audience knows " lawyers . " The great majority of them will not see the inside of a courtroom from one end of the year to the other ; any matters that reach court will be tried by a separate " litigation department " in the firm , or even farmed out to outside counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks , insurance companies and businesses  --  they advise their clients on taxes and government regulations , mergers , loans and financings , labor negotiations , contracts to buy and self properties so valuable that a few tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees seem trivial by comparison with the investment they protect . Such lawyers also handle , very profitably , the taxes , wills and estates of people who own big chunks of businesses , and with normal human perversity they are often most proud of the long-standing warm personal relations they have enjoyed with clients whose legal matters are almost entirely commercial . Historically these lawyers , like their clients . have been North European in origin and Protestant in religion , the justification being that clients have to tell their lawyers a lot of things WASP businessmen would hesitate to tell an Italian Catholic or a Jew . Today the businessmen are better educated , and nothing but brains counts for much  --  even women sometimes get to be partners . though rarely . Of course , the Wall Street lawyer , like his small-town colleague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to come to the office in a clean suit . Almost everyone in such a firm has a specialty , a separate area of the law which he knows as the milkmaid knows her cow . Teams of such specialists can , at least in theory , foresee all the legal consequences of any piece of corporate action and keep the corporation Out of positions in which the cow might kick it . Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr . once suggested to law students that to understand the law they should look at it through the eyes of " a had man . " Law is practiced on this principle in the big firms : the aim of every contract is to protect the client if it turns out that the fellow on the other side is a scoundrel or is confused twhich is more common and may he worse ) .

" By pointing out to the businessman all the ways he might get stung , the lawyer acquires a reputation as a pedant and pettifogger , or even as a sharp gent with too many ideas for larceny . Sometimes the reputation is deserved , One New York lawyer who specializes in corporate infighting likes to say that " in every negotiation there 's a moment when I tell the other guy , ' Look , if we 're going to make a deal , there are some areas where we 've just got to trust each other tr we ca n't get anywhere ' ? ant I if he 's fool enough to believe me , it " , a big advantage for my client . " Many modern legal documents ? " private law , " contracts between par-lies which will he enforced by the courts just as much as the law against stealing will be enforced , but only between the two of them  --  run longer than this issue of this magazine , and every word has at least one purpose . A misplaced comma can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of separate parties , each represented by his own counsel , the mere putting-together of the deal , after all negotiations have apparently been concluded , can be an exhausting experience . Two summers ago , for example . a group of American steel and insurance companies arranged to buy , at a price in eight figures , some of the enormous iron deposits recently discovered in Labrador . As the deal neared completion it fell through at the last minute ) , a ballroom was hired in a New York hotel and mountains of documents were stacked along its walls . As many as 50 lawyers , representing the different interests involved , would work together in the ballroom , determining the possible tax impact or antitrust dangers or pure economic risk inherent in each piece of paper . For much of July they worked seven days a week to midnight or even later .

The fanatic detail work 01 getting information on paper in proper form for big bank loans or for issues of new securities is known to the young lawyers who plod through it as " boilerplate . " Earl W. Kintner. former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission now practicing in a medium-sized Washington firm , uses the term " leaf-raking " to describe the searches through legal and corporate history that juniors make ( several researching the same point from different angles , unknown to each other ) . told my partners when I came into this firm , " Kintner said recently , " that 1 never wanted more than four or live assistants  --  I did n't want to be in a position where I had a staff that I had to keep busy .

When there are cases to be tried . it is impossible for a lawyer to know too much Joseph M. Proskauer. in his time a great advocate and a belligerent judge , now in his 80 's and bent over but still active as head of a New York law firm , likes to tell of George Wharton Pepper 's discussing a case that had been handled first by Charles Evans Hughes who had to drop it because he was appointed Chief Justices and then by John W. Davis . " Pepper said , " Proskauer recalls , " that Davis knew all about the case that it was necessary to know --  but Hagaes knew all about it .

" The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amiable lawyer in his late 50 's whose small office does virtually nothing but argue cases sent his way by 80-man offices . " is the fellow who 's prepared his case  --  it does n't matter if he 's at the top or the bottom of the bar . " And that sort of preparation often takes staff work . About a third of the lawyers in the big firms are " partners , " a term which does not by any means imply equality of income or of voice in the affairs of the firm . ( There are firms with 20 or 30 partners which are believed to have only three or four reed partners . who take the risks and split the gains : the other partners have the status but are basically on salary . s The other lawyers in the shop are employees . called " assaadates , " a gallant description invented 40 years ago to replace the inelegant word " clerk .

The others leave within 10 years of their arrival . often to the legal departments of corporate clients , where they may start a climb to executive status in business . The offices of the big firms spread over two , three . or more floors in the best office buildings . and for each lawyer there are usually one and a half other employees . secretaries . file clerks . receptionists , accountants , messengers and librarians Iwho manage what may be as many as 20,000 fat volumes of law books owned and used by the firm ) .

The largest of the law firms  --  New York 's Shearman &; Sterling , with about 170 lawyers and offices in both the uptown and downtown buildings of the First National City Bank , its largest client  --  probably takes in seven million dollars fsuch figures are never announced and almost never leaked ) . Nearly all of it must come from charges for lawyers time  --  about $50 an hour for a partner in the firm ( very senior people with large reputations , like Thomas E. Dewey of Dewey . Ballantine , Bushby , Palmer Si Wood . may cost up to $100 an hour ) , $30 an hour for the average " associate . " A senior partner 's income , however , is a slice of the profits rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as high as a junior 's . A Wall Street law firm is a lesson in Marxist economics  --  the bosses profit by the " surplus value " churned out in the labor of the workers . And the situation takes on an almost sinister appearance when one knows about the very secret lunch held annually by selected partners of half a dozen big firms , to decide what everyone will offer the new law-school graduate . This might make an interesting antitrust prosecution for some ambitious Justice Department lawyer . ) Associates are allowed to exercise only limited responsibility . They can not normally sign the firm 's name on letters to clients or fellow lawyers , and they are fairly sure to function for some years as somebody 's second in matters of any importance . Still , the associate will find himself from the beginning working on deals and cases of satisfyingly great importance , the sort of thing that winds up in the newspapers  --  and he will also do well .

In 1964 the Harvard Law School Class of 1949 printed the results of a survey of how well its members were doing after being out of school for 15 years . More than 330 of the 625 graduates replied , and few of them can be senior partners anywhere . Their average income was $33,000 . Of those in practice , the great majority were with sizable firms .

At that hour my memorandum was still in the hands of the stenographers . Mr. Byrne demanded to know why it was not ready , and I humbly pleaded that I had not had time to finish it . He glared al me and asked , ' What time did you go home on Friday night ? ' I replied , ' Three o'clock in the morning . ' ' What time did you go home Saturday night ?

Between them , our courts and administrative agencies , such as the National Labor Relations Board , annually grind out something like 300,000 " reported decisions " ? those considered important enough to call to the attention of lawyers  --  and a specialist has to know what is happening in his specialty in 50 states and all 11 federal circuits , not to mention the Washington agencies .

" He has no difficulty about getting it , either ; under court rules , the money is paid to the attorney . and he deducts his expenses and fee before passing the remainder to the client . Fees normally run one quarter of a settlement negotiated before trial . one third of a settlement negotiated during a trial , and two fifths of what the jury gives if the case goes all the way . A study in Pittsburgh half a dozen years ago claimed that " a significantly large number of cases ... are settled only after a jury is sworn . in order to allow the lawyer to collect his fee for ' a day ' in court . " In Britain . a solicitor who accepts a client on the understanding that he will get paid only if the case is won commits the crime of champerty and will go to jail for it . Even in the United States . the contingent fee makes many lbiglirmi lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pioneering book Justice and the Poor . Reginald Heber Smith of Boston denounced the contingent fee as " inconsistent with any theory that the lawyer is a minister of justice : He is an interested party to the litigation because he is betting on its outcome . ? . The contingent fee .. . induced the unholy triumvirate of lawyer-runner-doctor conspiring together to win fraudulent cases . It hasdenigrated expert testimony and served as a cloak for robbery through extortionate fees . " At least in theory . a lawyer is an officer of the court ; he has taken oaths to that effect . If there are precedents that go against his position , he is required by the ethics of his profession to bring them to the attention of the court whether his opponent does so or not . The requirement does not extend to facts  --  no lawyer is ever required to volunteer information that would harm a client 's case . ) Though the lawyer 's opinion id I he merit of his client 's cause is not important - It is its the judge III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his client is right or wrong , guilty or innocent ? lie is forbidden to elicit under isith statements which he knows to bt , false . The rules are by no means simple , because we have an " adversary system " of law , and a lawyer is hired to do battle for his client . " If you arc not a righter by disposition , " the St. Louis lawyer Lon Backer once said , " you should hire a fighter to try your Cases . " Criminal lawyers protect themselves against knowledge of their client 's guilt by never asking the client whether he did it the approved question is : " What do they have on you ? " l . There arr rules , though , and for practical reasons as well as reasons of pride most lawyers are scrupulous about them . But anyone who has spent any time sitting around American courtrooms knows beyond doubt that subornation of perjury has become routine behavior ' for distressingly large numbers of American trial lawyers . It must be said that the complaint is not new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York bar wrote that " perjury is decidedly on the increase , and at the present time scarcely a trial is conducted in which it does not appear in a more or less flagrant form . " The great bulk of time in American courtrooms today is spent processing personal-injury cases , New York ' sJacob Fuchsberg. who was president of the National Association of Claimants ' Counsel in 1964 when that organization changed its name to the more grandiloquent American Trial Lawyers Association , says that " eighty percent of alt civil litigation  --  eighty percent of all major litigation , including criminal  --  is in the tort field . " The word " tort , " from the French for " v.-rong , " covers generally the things that happen to you which should n't happen to you , where some piece of the blame can be put on somebody else . The old English common-law notion was that losses should be left where they fall unless the party who suffered them was totally blameless and somebody else did something wrong , and this is still the law in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth of insurance coverage la major fact of modern life which the law has never found a way to recognize ) , the definitions of " somebody else " and " something wrong " have spread out hugely . Today an injured person can collect from anyone who has been " negligent " in maintaining his property or manufacturing his product or driving his car or not watching where he puts his big feet . This branch of the law is thus more commonly known , inside and outside the profession , as " negligence work . " With 11 million accidents in the United States every year , there is a lot of it . For every case that comes to trial at least 10 ( mostly involving smaller damages ) have been settled before trial but after an action was filed with a court , and at least i0 have been settled without the filing of an action . But so many are tried that in most urban and suburban jurisdictions the courts are two to five years behind in dealing with them , with the result that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law , Given the central role of the legal system in American society and the high intelligence of the profession , problems that persist are inevitably hard ones . Major negligence lawyers like Fuchsberg , Harry Gair and Emile Zola Berman ( all with 20-man firms almost entirely specialized in this area of law ) believe that the great need is for greater emphasis on trial work in law school and on the job , though they also feel the country needs a few thousand more judges and courtrooms . Some judges , like Chief Judge Charles Desmond of the New York Court of Appeals , believe the villain is the jury trial , which tempts lawyers to seek the introduction of extraneous evidence and to wax dramatic . A jury trial places decisions as to the credibility of witnesses in the hands of people who can not tell a dishonest witness from an honest one , and Leads to wide variations in the awards given for similar injuries . Desmond feels that if judges decided such cases without a jury ( as they do in England ) , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . The insurance industry would like to see accident cases ( especially automobile cases ) taken out of the courts entirely and turned over to administrative panels , as on-the-job accidents were turned over to workmen's-compensation boards half a century ago . In the great majority of industrial accidents , injured workers are now entitled to compensation as a matter of right , with or without negligence on anyone 's part ; lawyers are not necessary , and where they are employed their fees are very tightly controlled by the compensation boards . None of these solutions is very promising . Law schools would like to improve their teaching of trial practice , but nobody really knows how to do it . ( Michigan is making the most elaborate effort . with closed-circuit , live television coverage of trials , followed by seminars at which the attorneys explain themselves Lo the students . ) The purpose of a law school is to teach law , and apart from the statutes ( which are only bare bones and worth relatively little without a thorough knowledge of how the courts are interpreting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of appeal . where there are no witnesses or juries . Students are often less than enthusiastic about the emphasis on appellate cases in law school ( " You 're teaching me to argue with Cardozo. " an Indiana University student complained to a professor . " and I 'm going to be in practice before Judge So-andSo , who never heard of Carclozo " , , but that is what the law is about as a learned profession . Law schools in their three-year programs must bring about major psychological changes in their students . They have to take young men and women who want to be liked and make them argumentative ; and they have to convince the students that a world which looks reasonably simple is crawling with legal questions . The first professional demand on the lawyer is to recognize the body of law that can be made to apply to his client 's situation . " The client does n't come into your office wearing a sign . ' I am McPherson r . Buick , ? says Alfred W. Gans , former editor-in-thief of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with assumed facts , and insist that he supply the law , with all his classmates listening and the professor prepared to be sarcastic about any stupidity . New graduates are best equipped to " look up the law , " to be judges ' clerks ( each Supreme Court Justice employs two such beginners , following a tradition established by Holmes and Brardeisi or to be assistants to lawyers preparing appeals . For trial work , most of what they have studied is irrelevant , incompetent and immaterial . At the trial level , real cases are almost never decided on points of law , as Judge Jerome Frank stressed a generation ago ; they are decided on the basis of facts . The experienced man preparing an accident case will probably spend more time with medical texts than with law books  --  and this is not what law school can teach . About all the school can do is give its students a good grasp on the rules of evidence and a few homilies that the best trial lawyers violate all the time ( " Never ask a witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Never ask a hostile witness . ' Why ? ' " and so on ) . " Anyway , " says Emile Zola Bet " t stull conic out of bo , Nor does the , : ikinen's:compensa lion analogy provide a satisfactory war Though it is distasteful to contemplate a jury debating the cash value of a lost eye to a 16-year-old girl , it is 1,0sitivelv disgusting to contemplate such items of human agony in the hands of a board of hat eaucrats armed with lists of fixed IP fOr every injury and low prix , .1 ) that . Whatever injustices may he done by juries , at least they consider the individual circumstance , while administrative agencies simply find pigeonholes . Even Chief Judge Desmond 's idea of keeping the trial but eliminating the jury rests on highly debatable premises . Though most judges are conscientious ( " A good judge , " says a Massachusetts lawyer . " will pay attention even though he 's bored " ? , the fact is that the experience of a trial grips a jury much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deceive the " ordinary people " of a jury more easily than they can hoodwink a judge , but the mixture of 12 sets of prejudices and perceptions can be wiser than the attitudes of a single man . If juries make extravagant awards , judges in most states and in the federal courts already have the power to scale them down . Nobody has been able to prove that the jury system is responsible for the waiting lists on the calendar . In their classic study . Delay in the Courts , a team of University of Chicago sociologists and law-school professors estimated that trials without juries in New York were about 40 percent shorter  --  but added that New Jersey seemed to get 20 percent more working hours per judge than New York did . Bad organization wastes the time of lawyers who adjourn cases in one courtroom only to sit waiting for hours , with their impatient witnesses , outside another courtroom where a judge or a clerk guessed wrong or carelessly about when a case would be called , Whenever several courts are situated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle three or four times as many cases as the  --  well , laziest judge . " A judge , " Philadelphia 's Curtis Bok. himself a judge . wrote , " is a member of the bar who once knew a governor . " Indeed , the situation can be worse than that in the 38 states where judges are elected through the normal political process , running at the bottom of a ticket which has more glamorous figures up top . Many lawyers have an uneasy feeling about the run-of-the-mine state judge . " The Bar Association gives him a test . " says the head of a big-city legal-aid bureau . " They put a hatchet , a gavel and a shotgun on a desk , and ask him to pick which one he 'd use if he became a judge . If he takes the gavel. he 's approved . " In New York City they still tell the story of a judge in a criminal court who used one particular lawyer as his bagman . Anyone prepared to pay for favors would hire this lawyer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and say , " Your Honor . I know a hundred reasons why this man should not go to jail " ; and the judge would snap back fiercely . " Ina case of this gi MAIN. , I will lived lire hundred reastais .

They appoint referees , trustees in bankruptcy and , especially attorneys to look after the f : minors who are beneficiaries urn ) will . And in all such cases they iluturinine how large a fee the lawyer shall receive . Often these lees are not published , and while they must he a matter of public record , they are hard to uncover . Many lawyers find the political atmosphere of a state courtroom so oppressive that they will try whenever possible to " manufacture " a diversity jurisdiction that will move their case to the federal court . Philadelphia lawyers grew especially good at this gambit , and the 1963 meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing a change in the federal code which would keep Pennsylvanians in their own courts . A spokesman for the Philadelphia group protested bitterly , first on technical grounds and then with the blunt statement . " We get a better brand of justice in the federal courts . " Much of this is just griping  --  blaming the judge is always the easy way out for the lawyer who has just Lost a case . ( " I know how that wig stays on his head , " said a Maine lawyer a generation ago , when Maine judges followed the English fashion , " It 's nailed on . " ) Judges are a proud and solitary lot , who eat their lunches alone or with other judges because they ca n't publicly mix with practicing lawyers , and who usually watch their choice of friends for the evening . Even in states where an election campaign may cost more than a year 's salary and a year 's salary is often less than $15,000 ) , pride of office keeps men honest . But the quality is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosenman , Franklin Roosevelt 's assistant and companion , now president of the New York City bar association , said recently : " Let us face this sad fact : that in many  --  in far too many  --  instances , the benches of our courts in the United States are occupied by mediocrities , men of small talent , undistinguished in performance , technically deficient and inept . " The problem can be overstressed . " It 's true some of the state court judges are n't the brightest people in the world , " says Professor Soia Mentschikoff of the University of Chicago Law School . " Why should they be ? " Temperament and the ability to listen are more important ; judges are not supposed to know everything . One of the most telling criticisms ever made of Justice Holmes was the comment , " That fellow is always deciding cases on points that were not raised in the briefs of either side . " The essence of the system is that the judge normally relies on the legal arguments made by the lawyers ( " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , not on his own learning  --  just as the jury is supposed to draw its conclusions of fact solely on the basis of the evidence offered in court , not on " common sense . " A brilliant judge , particularly if he used to be a trial lawyer himself , can Itemise negligence lawyer. ; have fought in courts aml iii 11 , eisliii tires as min will fight when i hi , n interests are at stake , the Ant , eiinsumiscan now sue the , ? 1 of a faulty product , the pal lulu . it , the city hospital that gave him tile wrong drugs , the airline can not hide behind the small print un the ticket when a plane crashes . If it has made the profession less proud , the contingent fee has made society more humane  --  which is , after all , the ultimate moral purpose of law . The pity is that most Americans most often experience the full panoply of law only as plaintiffs or defendants , witnesses or jurors , in a personal-injury action , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People can acquire an even lower opinion of the law , of course , if their only contact is with the police and with the courts at the very bottom of the hierarchy  --  the justice-of-the-peace establishments in the countryside and the smaller cities , the traffic courts and minor criminal courts in the big cities . Here , by and large , lawyers are not involved ; and neither . usually , is law . Americans inherited the J.P . system from England , where it is a fascinating legacy of the fiction which was the origin of Anglo-American law  --  the notion that the King had an interest in the " peace " of his kingdom and could therefore issue writs to insure the settlement of disputes which might otherwise disturb the peace . In Britain . justices of the peace are squires , men of standing and property in their community . who serve without pay by the command of the Throne . In the United States , the office is typically elective , usually salaried . sometimes ! worst of all ) financed by splitting the fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the J.P . himself . In both countries the most immediately noticeable result has been an extremely conservative bottom-level judiciary ; when it comes to eviction proceedings or swooping raids by the finance company , the initials translate to " judgment for the plaintiff . " In Iowa . J.P . ' s get paid a fee only if the plaintiff wins . J.P . ' s also make the decision on whether the cops have enough on some poor devil to justify holding him until the next meeting of a grand jury ( which may be several months away , if the arrest occurs in the late spring ) ; and it is almost unheard-of for them to release a prisoner , or to demand less bail than the county attorney recommends . Few J.P . ' s are lawyers , and not many more know much about law . Only a few years ago an investigating committee from the New Mexico State Legislature found several who were actually illiterate . ( " I can read all right , " one said plaintively . " It 's just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers " hold court " in the back of a gas station or in a bedroom behind a grocery store . " I remember some years ago going to find a probate judge in Santa Rosa , " says Robert Emmet Clark of the University of New Mexico Law School , " and I found him washing dishes in a restaurant . " Even where people of ability and devotion undertake this part-time labor . read all the books the state sends them , attend the annual two-day courses for J.P . ' s and take the trouble to drive to the Town Hall rather than line the miscreant in the comfort of their own homes  --  even then , the law administered in J.P . courts is crude stuff . At a recent meeting of J.P . ' s in an eastern state , called to discuss the control of juvenile delinquency , an earnest curio-shop operator described the results he had achieved by lining parents ' . One of the few lawyers in the group said , " I can find no authority in any statute for imposing fines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J.P. , less worried about his authority , remarked cheerfully , " Oh . I collect a lot of money .... " If the J.P . courts are overly personal , the minor Courts in the big cities can easily become inhuman . There is too much business for them . Excluding traffic violations , court dockets show six million " criminal cases " a year , half of them for drunkenness and vagrancy and more than 80 percent of the rest , incidentally , resulting in acquittals or dismissals ) . In New York City hundreds of people will be picked up every day by the police , kept for a while at a station house , then slapped into vans , thrown into bullpens behind the back wall of the courtroom , and paraded out , filthy and miserable , for the scrutiny of a judge . There is a " social court " for the bums and drunks , special " parts " devoted exclusively to prostitutes , or numbers runners , or narcotics peddlers . There are mobs on both sides of the wall of the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to make bail ; before , the prisoners on bail , often with their families , sitting in uneasy company with the police officers who are trying to put them away and who will presently shepherd them to the bar , the distracted lawyers running in and out , checking with the clerk , trying to learn when their cases will be called , handling a dozen items at once , planning a little last-minute negotiation with the Assistant D.A. , a bit of quiet converse before the bench when the case is called . Even here , in these most wretched of courts , an experienced and civilized judge , like the late Judge W. McKay Skillman of Detroit , can squeeze moments of decency from the proceedings . Skillman , who had handled such cases for 38 years ( longer than anyone else in the country ) would work through a long overnight line of prostitutes and lighters and drunks ( two categories : " staggering drunk " or " down and out " ) . As each member of the line came forward , a probation officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prisoner 's previous record . To either side of the judge , on the dais , stood neat young men , representatives of the Salvation Army and Christian Enterprise , who had talked with the prisoners before the opening of court , and were prepared to take those who would rather sober up in an atmosphere of charity than dry out in the hoosegow . Where wives had called the cops on their husbands , Skillman sent the couples to the back of the room to talk it over and see if they really wanted to involve the majesty of the law . Where prostitutes had been trapped by policemen . he explored the extent to which they had been soliciting and the places involved ( cooperating with the city in its policy of keeping certain neighborhoods clean ) ; if there was a cabbie who had taken the plainclothesman to the lady , and could lose his hack license on conviction , the judge wanted a lot of detail . One old drunk stoutly denied he had been drinking : " I had an asthma attack. - " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago ? " " Yes , sir . I was drunk . " " January 27th ? " " I was drunk that time , " " But this time it was asthma ? " " Y 1,1 , sir . Sometimes it comes over nit ' , 1 get sick . " " 111 other words , you do n't want to go to jail right now ? " " Yes , sir . " " All right ; you 're Not Guilty . But do n't let me see you here tomorrow . " Another defendant , caught with policy slips : " You have a job ? " " Two jobs  --  a laundry and a car wash. - " With policy running , that makes three jobs . " The policeman added , " Counting moonshine , four . " Skillman asked , " He had moon-shine ? " " Quart . " " Fifty dollars ! " There was almost never a jail sentence in Skillman 's court when a man had a job . Skillman was furious at what modern society had done to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only places where derelicts can live , and his pet hate was the automatic pin-setting machine which has made it impossible for a beaten man to earn the price of a meal by working at a bowling alley . He had little affection for the laws against prostitution . Orison Marden , former president of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association and in private practice a senior partner in the Wall Street firm of White &; Case ) , says that " you 've got to be a pretty sympathetic human being to hold down a magistrate 's job for any length of time . " Still , the law is the law , and Judge Skillman , like others , would sentence to $10 or 10 days , knowing that a penniless man will have to serve the 10 days ; he would convict the starving man who stole a box of cookies from the A &P,; would take the word of the cop over that of the prostitute . As John F. Kennedy once argued , " Life is unfair " ; and the trial judges have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as judges . do much about it . For the courts deal routinely with Law , and only occasionally with Justice . People are always and unnecessarily confusing these two terms , the one a set of predictions that can be made to come true , the other a moral and political abstraction . When " talking about justice , " Benjamin Cardozo wrote with his typical sweet acidity . " the quality we have in mind is charity . " In fact , as the Bostonian Charles P. Curtis once wrote , " When you hear a lawyer appealing to the justice of his cause , it 's a pretty good guess that the law . , . is against him . " In the same book ( Late as Large as Life ) , Curtis repeated a story that had been told to him by Judge Learned Hand about a conversation between Hand and Justice Holmes just before one of the meetings at which the Supreme Court dikussed the disposition of pending motions and cases : " I wanted to provoke a response . so as he walked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-bye . Do justice ! ' He turned quite sharply and he said , ' Come here . come here . ' I answered , ' Oh , 1 know . I know . ' He replied . ' That is not my job . My job is to play the game according to the Hiles . ' " And the game is such that many of the rules must be morally neutral . Take , for example , the classic question of contract law  --  the offer to sell made by mail on Monday and delivered to the buyer on Wednesday , and accepted by him in a letter mailed later that Wednesday but not delivered to the seller until Friday . On Thursday the seller changes his mind , and sends a telegram revoking the offer . Has a sale been made ? In such situations , it is far less important that justice be done for each case than that the rule be firm . so people can rely on it in their dealings with each other . ( In the example above , there is a contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but acquire connotations of right-and-wrong once they are established . Sir Frederick Pollock . who lived in England but did a lot of traveling , used as his example the question of whether vehicles should drive on the left or the right side of the road . Once a society has decided on one side . its becomes morally wrong to career along ) on the other . Law creates morality , and so does custom . Nobody criticizes a doctor for charging friends less than he would charge people he does n't know . or a clergyman for varying his price for performing a marriage  --  indeed , such differential pricings are often considered praiseworthy . But if a shoe manufacturer sells the same shoes to two competing department stores for two different prices , he probably breaks the law and does something almost universally considered " unjust " ? even when the buyer for one of the department stores is his kid brother . And there are cases still where the law goes counter to most people 's sense of morality and justice . In New York it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intersection when the light turns red can not recover damages if he is hit by a drunken driver who has been busting red lights all down the street but happens to have this one with him . Nearly everywhere there is no way out except charity or a lawsuit of his own for the person who has bought a defec tive product on the installment plan : his contract has been sold to a bank or a finance company , and he owes the money to the bank or finance company even if the car wo n't run or the freezer wo n't freeze . Divorce laws are riddled with injustice , and their administration compounds their immorality . In Iowa , for example , a couple that wants a divorce can get it easily  --  any allegation of minor cruelties , if not contested by the other party , will ride right through the courts . But the Iowa courts almost never grant a divorce if the grounds are contested . which means that one spouse soften enough the guilty one ) can hold up the other unmercifully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse . of course . As recently as 50 years ago , in many jurisdictions , it was dangerous to cripple a man , because he might sue you  --  but it was perfectly safe to kill him accidentally , because the courts would not hear a case brought in behalf of his survivors . On the authority of the British House of Lords . a man injured on the job in America by the carelessness of another worker could not in 1900 sue his boss  --  he and the man who injured him were " fellow servants . " and the employer had nothing to do with it . Anyway , he had " assumed the risk " of his employment . Legal Aid Societies were founded originally to do something about the sharks who took immigrants off the boats , promised them wages , worked them a week and then refused to pat anything . In those days , within the memories of living men , just the court costs of fding a suit were greater than an unskilled worker 's week 's pay . and most Legal Aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cases were not too much greater than the recoveries for their clients . Up to the time of the First World War . a man who cracked up in his brand-new car because the brakes did n't work had nobody to sue : his only contract was with the dealer , the dealer 's obligation was merely to use Anil when I ma ? to the end , lvh:o lu was cairn . ' Tiammit , a , + , allowed to The union mem. bent were reinstated , with hack pay Because the decision was so specific ' limited to the question of what should be done in this particularly raw situation ' , the question of what other companies would and would not be allowed to do in the future was left completely in the air . In the year since , the NLRB has cited Fibreboard to order that a company must bargain with its union before it can sell off a factory to someone else . shut down part of a Plant . reduce production and employment because orders have been cancelled . Whether Fibreboard really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide at some later time . Indeed . an examination of recent Supreme Court decisions often indicates ( especially to the angry chief judges of the State Supreme Courts , who have to pick up the pieces ' that the justices have reversed Hughes 's dictum  --  that they regard the law as settled by the courts below them , and will now look at the facts . the human result the law has wrought , and decide whether or not the law should be changed . H. L. A. Hart of the Harvard Law School says . almost despairingly , " Today you have the highest court in the nation trying to administer a Constitution on a case-by-case basis . " A Clarence Earl Gideon is convicted of robbery in a trial where he does not have a lawyer ; a Danny Escobedo confesses to a killing while his lawyer , denied access to him , sits in a police-station waiting room ; the Tennessee legislature refuses to reapportion itself ; someone is denied a passport without an explanation of the reasons  --  the court rules and the law changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by the progress of new cases through the chain of courts . Courts , lawyers and police have become , as Attorney General Nicholas deB . Katzenbach recently complained in a letter to a lederal appellate judge , " increasingly unsure of the law . " No doubt the current Justices do take a " creative " view of the law one of them caused great offense at an informal meeting of law-school professors when he said he liked the docket for the coming term . " which gives us a chance to make some progress in the area of personal liberties " ' . But . as McGeorge Bundy once put it . " The fundamental function of the law is to prevent the natural unfairness of society from becoming intolerable . " The lawyers ' aphorism says that " hard cases make had law " ; but it is also Gobviously true . as John Chipman ray ' pointed out 60 years ago . that bad laws make too many hard cases . Technical defects in decisions that reach an individually just result can normally be remedied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; tut of Con But nobody- can ever ewe a nem I , . ak the years he spent in tail because he was unreasonably convicted of a crime , or the years he spent in poverty because his just claim for damages was defeated on an unnecessary technicality . " The Supreme Court of the United States . " as Thomas Reed Powell once said of an earlier bench , are by no means such fools as they talk , or as the people are who think them so . " Finally , and fortunately , there is a practical limit to the number I if appeals the Supreme Court can hear . so that judges a little closer to the daily life of the community remain responsible for the administration of the law . The courts , and their cousins di , administrative agencies , provide an institutional frame within which the lawyer works ; the tension between law and justice gives depth to the picture in the frame . At worst . the lawyer 's training tells him the focal points of the picture , the central design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual rights . privileges . powers and immunities . At best , alert sensitivity and careful work give the lawyer a sense of where a focus is changing , where the picture , never finished , can now be retouched again . Thus equipped . he gets his hands on a client and advises him on what he maybe can and maybe ca n't do . The client has an adversary , public or private , real or potential ; and the adversary has a lawyer . Their sense of relevancy sharpened by experience , their understanding of the opposing position sharpened by the daily need to predict what opponents will do next , the lawyers try out with each other the possibilities of compromise . At the lawyers ' elbows are their clients . each increasingly convinced of the essential fairness of his own claims and positions as he hears his lawyer speak them , even if it was originally agreed that some of them were to be put forward only as bargaining counters . What is the case worth ? Would a jury convict ? Is this the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court ? How badly does he want that divorce ? Can we afford just to let the deal go ? The courts , the agencies and the law are always in the background . an expensive last resort , like a strike at the end of a labor negotiation . " The hardest thing . " says a Wall Street lawyer , " is to know when you 've won . I 've physically pilled clients out of conference rooms because we 'd just gained the only point that really mattered to us and I had to be sure he did n't give it back . " " There is no law , " says a small-city lawyer . " There 's just me , and tie lawyer on the other side . And some . times there 's a judge . "
