SPQ Against Malaria <P> As U.S. troops extend their operations in Viet Nam , especially in the Central Highlands , the Viet Cong have found an ally in an especially severe form of malaria resistant to the most potent drugs . Now an Army doctor , Major Peter J. Bartelloni , reports in the A.M.A. Journal that the wonder druggists have done it again . A new , long-acting sulfa , sulformethoxine , developed in Britain , has sent the cure rate soaring and , just as dramatically , reduced the relapse rate . <P> The vicious falciparum type of malaria parasite is responsible for virtually all the malaria that strikes U.S. troops , despite their " Sunday pill " of chloroquine and pyrimethamine . These parasites even overcome the protective effect of a potent third antimalarial , dia-phenylsulfone ( DOS ) , given to troops in the highlands . Falciparum 's fever may be fatal if it attacks the brain . Last winter U.S. medics were saving nearly all their patients by intensive treatment with chloroquine and quinine , but 40% of the men suffered relapses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPQ " combination . Then they dropped the quinine and dosed malarial G.I.s with a combination of the new sulfa and pyrimethamine . Result : The new drug not only cures patients faster and kills parasites in the blood , but reduces the relapse percentage from 40% to a scant 2%.
