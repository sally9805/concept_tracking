Colonialism , as every African politician well knows , is the greatest evil in the modern world-and the most exploitable . It can be blamed for internal economic ills and incompetence , not to mention cold war and all other conflicts among nations . But colonialism-except in its Communist form-is fast dying out , and the African nationalists have been growing desperate in their search for a replacement . Last week , before the U.N . General Assembly , Ghana 's Foreign Minister Ako Adjei found one : neocolonialism . " The colonial powers , " said Adjei , " realize that the time has come for them to concede independence to the African people . However , they try to use every device to deprive the new African states of the real substance and meaning of their national independence . " How ? " By such devices as military pacts , economic and cultural agreements , and the granting of scientific and technical assistance . " <P> <P> As Adjei spoke . President Kwame Nkrumah was courting U.S. aid money to finance a pet project that should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come : a $196 million dam and power plant to be built on the Volta River . ( According to an Administration official . President Kennedy intends to send a mission to Accra " to rivet some things down " before approving the project . ) Meanwhile , a 19-man Ghana delegation was heading for Russia-where Nkrumah himself had just paid a call-to wrap up economic and cultural agreements . Ghana was also preparing to invite a Soviet military mission to train the country 's small ( 6,000-man ) army . Plainly Nkrumah was moving Ghana farther than ever from the Commonwealth , closer than ever to Moscow . He fired his British defense chief , Major General Henry Alexander ( one of whose duties had been advising Nkrumah just how anti-British he could get without angering London ) . His replacement was General Stephen Otu , who considers Russian methods and weapons superior . <P> Also dismissed were the British chiefs of Ghana 's small navy and air force and seven moderate government officials , including Health Minister K. A. Gbedemah , who helped Nkrumah found his Convention Peoples ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Ghana 's controlled press , meantime , stepped up its anti-British campaign . One paper accused Britain of fomenting labor unrest , another charged it had plotted the death of Dag Hammarskjold . The Accra Evening News , angry at the proposed November visit of Queen Elizabeth ( ' ' the head of a bloated kingdom " ) , called on the government to cancel the invitation . But Nkrumah is still unwilling to give up his position in the Commonwealth . In London . Ghana 's Acting High Commissioner Kwesi Armah called a press conference to erase any thoughts that the Queen would be unwelcome . Said he : " A hilarious and dignified welcome awaits the Queen and Prince Philip . "
