Kings once resorted to the uncomplicated companionship of their court jesters to lighten the burden of loneliness that often accompanies power . U.S. Presidents have generally managed less condescending personal friendships while in office . Both Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower had the easy company of George Allen , an adept poker player and raconteur . Dave Powers served as a sort of White House entertainer under John Kennedy , accompanying the President to ball games and cracking Boston Irish gags to relax him . <P> <P> Richard Nixon will also have at least one crony with whom he can feel completely comfortable when the pressures of office grow too great . Charles Gregory ( " Bebe " ) Rebozo , however , is not exactly a court jester . He is a Florida real estate millionaire who evidently made his fortune by bringing to bear the very sort of methodical perseverance that won the presidency for Nixon . Commenting on a certain steady , plodding quality in Rebozo , one unfriendly observer says : " He is just like Nixon . That 's why they 're such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100,000 house next to Nixon 's rented Key Biscayne hideaway in Florida . He undoubtedly enjoys a unique relationship with the President-elect . In the midst of Nixon 's labors over Cabinet appointments , the two have set off on Rebozo 's $18,000 houseboat for cruises off Key Biscayne . " When we go boating , " Rebozo said , " we do some fishing , some swimming and a lot of sunbathing . We work too . Dick takes his briefcase and I take mine . " <P> <P> No Attraction . A swarthy , self-effacing man , Rebozo was born in Tampa , Fla. , of Cuban parents in 1912 . He worked as a chauffeur , airline steward and gas-station operator after finishing high school . At the end of World War II , he went into the coin-laundry business , then a finance company , finally into real estate . He is now president of the Fisher Corp. , a Florida development firm in which Nixon holds shares valued at $400,000-double the amount he initially invested . <P> Rebozo assiduously avoids any contact with the press that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss politics . A reporter recently suggested a White House appointment and Rebozo snorted : " We 've never even discussed it , and I do n't expect to . " His friendship with Nixon goes back to 1951 , when Florida 's Senator George Smathers asked Rebozo to entertain Nixon , a fellow freshman , at Key Biscayne . Rebozo took him fishing and remembers , " We just hit it off . " The friendship developed , as did Nixon 's habit of flying to Florida for the sun . On election night in 1960 , Rebozo was the only outsider invited to Nixon 's Ambassador Hotel suite in Los Angeles to watch returns with the family . While Nixon conferred with aides , it fell to Rebozo to comfort Pat and the girls as John Kennedy emerged the winner of a historically close race for the presidency .
