txt Mayor Lindsay , who has been protesting cutbacks in Federal appropriations for the city 's summer job programs , learned last night that New York would receive even less Neighborhood Youth Corps aid than he had anticipated . The Mayor received a telegram from Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz announcing that the city 's share of supplemental Youth Corps appropriations would be $1-million  --  not $1.3-million as Mr. Lindsay had said he expected . " This is the end , " Mr. Lindsay said as he arrived at Julia Richmond High School for a speech , " but possibly not the final end of a dreary record . " Share Less Than 10% Secretary Wirtz 's telegram informed the Mayor that the city 's share of a $13-million supplemental summer job appropriation approved last week by Congress would be less than the 10 per cent portion that New York has received in the past . The supplemental appropriation brings the total Federal aid allocated for the Youth , Corps here to $11.7-million , compared with $13.1-million last year . But in his telegram Mr. Wirtz maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hire ' slum teen-agers to clean vacant , lots and pick up papers along highways . " This money , " the Secretary 's telegram said , " brings to $11.8-million city records show only $11.7-million the Federal funds allocated to New York City this year , which will pay for 26,900 Neighbor // hood Youth Corps jobs , compared to the 23,900 jobs we authorized and funded last summer . " A major factor in the dispute between the Mayor and Federal officials involves Mr. Lindsay 's assertion that this year 's 26,900 jobs would last only for 8 weeks , while last summer 's jobs lasted 10 weeks . Mr. Wirtz stressed that the city had " drastically reduced its support " of the Youth Corps by not appropriating any money this year , compared with the $5.2-million it appropriated in 1967 . The city built the corps up to a membership of 43,000 last year by using its own money after filling the Federal quota of 23,900 jobs . The Mayor had been calling on the Federal Government to provide more than $18-million to finance a 1963 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriation for New York of only $10.7-million and then added the $1-million yesterday , for a total of $11.7-million . Charges by Lindsay The reductions have led to charges by Mr. Lindsay that President Johnson and Congress " have turned their backs on the cities . " Another result has been a series of demonstrations such as one yesterday , in which 1,500 youths rampaged in the City Hall area . After the demonstration , four of the city 's five Borough Presidents called on the Mayor to convene special meetings of the Board of Estimate and City Council to amend the city 's expense and capital budgets to appropriate $5-million to expand the Youth Corps . In his telegram , Mr. Wirtz also reported to the Mayor that the Labor Department had appropriated $500,000 for job training for the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corpora . tion . A spokesman for the Mayor said that the corporation , established by the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy , was an independent organization that did not supply the kind of temporary jobs that could be offered to unskilled young people . Mr. Lindsay has often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year were a principal reason that the city did not have the kind of riots that Detroit and Newark underwent . The Mayor has also said that New York is the only American city that has contributed a significant amount of money for summer job programs . The fact that the city has not appropriated money this year  --  although Mr. Lindsay 's aides said yesterday that city money would probably be used if no more Federal aid was provided ? is a major reason for the sharp reduction in the size and scope of the Youth Corps program this year . Lindsay 's Hope The complex mathematics and the political overtones of the dispute between the Republican Mayor and Democratic officials in Washington have confused the issues involved in the Youth Corps argument . Mr. Lindsay wanted the Federal Government alone to finance a summer job program equal to the joint Federal-city program last year . The 1967 program began as a $13.1-million project involv , ing 23,900 youths hired for 10 weeks at $37 a week . But as the summer wore on , the city kept hiring teen-agers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling that Washington could pay the extra cost with Youth Corps money not used by other cities . The Mayor lost the gamble . , The extra 19,100 members cost $5.2-million , and the Federal Government refused to reimburse the city . The $5.2-million provided at the end of last summer is the city appropriation that Mr. Wirtz has condemned Mr. Lindsay for not providing in 1968 . It would have cost Washington $18-million to meet Mayor Lindsay 's demands . Instead , the city received $10.7-million in a regular Youth Corps appropriation earlier this year and expected $1.3-million more from the suplemental appropriation passed by Congress last week . But the city will receive only $1 ? million of the $13-million for all the nation 's cities . The $13-million figure was agreed upon in a joint conference on a bill sponsored by Senator Jacob K. Javits that would have provided a $75-million supplemental appropriation for all cities . This bill was passed by the Senate . Mr. Lindsay made his most recent attack on the Federal Government when he learned that the $75-million grant had been cut to $13-million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration had been over-optimistic about the chances of final approval of the $75-million supplemental appropriation and that this was the reason that no city money had been appropriated in the $5.9-billion municipal budget . Borough Leaders ' Demand Yesterday , however , the four Democratic Borough Presidents proposed that the city budget be amended to provide a local appropriation of $5-million , which would pay for 15,000 jobs . The proposal was put forth ( by Percy E. Sutton of Manhat- ! tan , Herman Badillo of the Bronx , Abe Stark of Brooklyn and Mario Cariello of Queens . While the four men said that Mr. Lindsay 's criticism of Washington officials was accurate , they added that the " resouces of our city government should be mobilized to carry out the Youth Corps program .
