The Deadly Game ( adapted from a novel of Friedrich Duerrenmatt by James Yaffe ) catches the author of the bitterly sardonic The Visit in a slightly more playful mood . His playfulness involves the gallows ; his answer to man 's love of money is to put a price on his head . This time his people play murder . A brash , coarse , well-heeled American salesman ( Pat Hingle ) , whose car has broken down , asks a snowy night 's lodging in a Swiss chalet . There he finds a retired judge ( Ludwig Donath ) , a retired prosecutor ( Max Adrian ) and a retired defense lawyer ( Claude Dauphin ) who meet regularly to dine well and then stage trials-in a " Court of the Unconscious , where the law does not reach " - of various living or historical characters . Invited to stand trial for murder , the American , equally cocksure of his innocence and his smartness at games , accepts . Under steady grilling , he makes more and more admissions while growing more and more angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss 's job and half-unconsciously brought about his boss 's death . <P> As another of Duerrenmatt 's pessimistic , Pernod-flavored judgments on mankind , The Deadly Game has both its moral and its theatrical merits . Few men tried at Duerrenmatt 's Court of the Unconscious would escape whipping ; in the unconscious of the very men who stage the trials there may lurk as much blood lust as love of law . They , with their icy , refined , half-mad sense of justice , and the American , with his coldhearted dog-eat-dog view of life , face one another with contrasted inhumanity ; the space between them seems nothing less at times than all groping humanity itself . But the play has a parlor-game brittleness and bite , and at its best a thrusting theatricality . Adapter Yaffe needs half an evening of **29;1321;TOOLONG ? before he is ready with his parlor game ; and is perhaps overready to have his American convict himself , to create another death of a salesman . Even with good acting , the play does not really have enough impact : Duerrenmatt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the clever game never quite reaches the level of a serious judgment . <P> Roman Candle ( by Sidney Sheldon ) , which closed at week 's end , was a farce about an Army scientist pursued by a girl with extrasensory perception . The pursuit took place in back-to-back Washington apartments , with time out for launching missiles in Alaska and for unloosing endless gags about the Army , the Navy , the Air Force , horse racing , Eisenhower golf , lovemaking , martini-making and money . <P> Roman Candle is one of those mechanized gag-farces that , along with a few good gags , are full of forced plot twists and vaudeville turns , broken-down scene writing and fruitless inventions .
