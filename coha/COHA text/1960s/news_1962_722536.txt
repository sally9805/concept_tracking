txt " We 're not letting the Government tell us we have to be satisfied with a simple gain . " These words , from a spokesman for the International Association of Machinists , point up the/determination with which union nego ? tiators in the aerospace industry currently are pressing demands for pay and fringe benefit gains in new two-year contracts . The IAM and ' the United Auto Workers , both AFL-C10 off i ? Hates , are the two major unions that bargain for some 400,000 aerospace employes . Right now , company and union negotiators are hard at work at a handful of major aerospace companies trying to avert a strike which would seriously cripple the nation 's defense and space programs . The prospect for an early settlement is not promising , however . Both companies and unions acknowledge that little progress has been made in negotiations so far . The unions already have set a strike for July 23 if an agreement has not been reached by thin . The companies which would be struck Maude Lockheed Aircraft Corp. , North Ameri , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of General Dynamics Corp. , Aerojet-General Corp. , a subsidiary of General Tire and Rubber Co. , and Ryan Aeronautical Corp . The situation represents one of the ' most significant challenges to President Kennedy 's policy of wage-price restraint since the abortive attempt in mid-April of leading steel companies to increase prices . The crux-of the issue in the aerospace dispute is the discrepancy in pay between the aerospace workers and employes In the auto and steel industries . According to the Bitreau of Labor Statistics , the average hourly pay for aerospace workers is $2.71 , against $2.87 for auto workers and 53.18 for steel employes . Says the IAM spokesman : " We 're demanding a ' catch-up ' raise before we even begin to talk about a 3% wage hike . " The Kennedy Administration has indicated wage increases of no more than 3% a year would not be considered inflationary . Government Intervention Likely The U.S. Government is likely to become an important third party in the aerospace negotiations . For one thing , President Kennedy is reported to be under some pressure to act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the companies In thy steel price matter . ' For , another thing , the Government , using taxpayers ' money , buys about 90% of the aerospace industry 's products . In the current fiscal year the Government plans to spend $17.3 billion with the industry , up from 515.3 billion in the year ended June 30 . As such an important customer , of course , the Government has a vital interest in holding down casts . The unions also see a possible role in this drama for the Government . but their casting is considerably different . They hold the Government has a duty to help them overcome sort of " second class " economic status by bringing their wages and benefits up to the levels of the auto and steel induStries . " Government , whose policies are in large measure responsible for the problems of defense production workers , has an obligation to help in the solution of these problems , " the two unions stated recently in a , joint resolution . Although union demands center on a basic wage increase , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for supplemental unemployment benefits ( SUB ) , which have been a part of auto and steel labor contracts since 1055 but which do n't exist in the aerospace industry . SUB is designed to supplement stale unemployment compensation so that , in most cases , a laid-off worker would receive for a period up to 52 weeks income equal to 62% of his net take-home pay for a 40-hour week . Auto manufacturers contribute five cents per hour per worker to the company-maintained SUB funds ; in the steel industry , the contribution is 9.5 cents an hour . SUB also includes a termination pay program in which the worker . builds up a severance pay entitlement based on his hourly pay rate and on his length of service up to 30 years . Some Get Benefits In UAW agreements at plants of General Motors , Chrysler and other auto and auto parts companies engaged also in aerospace production , SUB is allowed in Government contracts . A ? UAW official says that , as an example . SUB is accepted by the Government as a cost of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AC Spark Plug does a substantial amount of subcontracting in aerospace for North American Aviation . But North American , the prime contractor , has no SUB plan . If aerospace workers should win a SUB plan in their new contract , it could prove costly to the companies . Based on a five-cent-anhour contribution for each of the 33,550 workers in its IAM bargaining unit . Lockheed would be hit with about $3.4 million extra per year in labor costs by such a provision . The unions have drawn the Government into their SUB demands . A joint UAW-IAM resolution reads : " Since the security of aircraft and missile workers is dependent on the expenditures made by Government for the equipment they produce , Government has a special responsibility to assure that their economic security is guaranteed . Either Government prohurement agencies should reimburse each contractor for SUB and separation payments made to laid-off employes charging such costs to all funds ' obligated for aircraft and missiles rather than charging the cost of such benefits to a particular contract or contractor , or , if an industry-wide fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government must recognize that it has the responsibility of insuring the solvency of such fund and supplementing the payments made from the fund if necessary to afford security to aircraft and missile workers . " Procurement Policies Attacked The unions blame Government procurement policies for production swings which cause unsteady employment levels in the Industry . " Defense orders appear to he rotated among that number of companies the Government desires to keep in business . " the unions ' joint resolution continues . " For example , if the Interest of the nation , as seen by the procurement people , requires a certain standby capacity for the production of Navy fighters far and away greater than the volume of orders at any given moment , then successive Navy contracts are rotated from North American to Chance Vought to Douglas to . This policy , however , also means a Government-sponsored planned program of employment insecurity for the very workers whose efforts contribute to the security of others . " The unions also are far from satisfied with the separation plans which were won in some aerospace contracts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company-sponsored fund which would give workers laid off four weeks or more 550 for each year of service up to a maximum of MO . But when the funds are exhausted or are diminishing , laid-off workers must settle for less . At Convair in San Diego , for example , mass layoffs in the past year which cut the work force front 20,000 to about 8,000 have made such demands on the separation pay fund that workers are settling for about half of what contracts there called for , according to an IAM official . Laid-off workers at Martin Co. ' s Baltimore plant last year averaged 528 per year of service , the union says . The unions call present aerospace separation plans " woefully inadequate . " Among other arguments , they say the plans compare very unfavorably with those in other industries : at GM , for example , the maximum benefit available is $4,000 . Insurance Gains Sought In their insurance and health security demands this year , the unions also are seeking substantial gains . For example , present company contributions to Insurance programs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour to 5.5 cents an hour . The unions would like something more on the order of steel and auto company contributions , which range from 7.7 cents to 10.4 cents an hour . This Is the year , the unions say , when they will shoot for union shops . Union shop agreements prevail in about 70% of all labor contracts outside the aerospace industry ; within the industry , only about 30% of the contracts contain union shop provisions . A union shop provision makes It mandatory for all workers in a bargaining unit to belong to the union that bargains for It . " IVe feel union shop agreements are basically and morally right because we are compelled to bargain for everyone in the plants we represent , " say the unions . Current union membership in the West Coast aerospace industry rens about 75% of total employes , the companies say . On wages . In addition to seeking basic raises , the unions are fighting to keep costofliving clauses which were gained in 1980 negotiations and which Lockheed , at least . wants to junk as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases totaling six cents an hour . tied In the Department of Commerce 's cost-of-living index . " We 're not going to give up in 1982 what we fought so hard for in 1980 , " declares Leonard Woodcock . UAW vice president In charge of aerospace . A Major Part of Industry The unions are pressing their demands particularly hard this year because they have so many contracts expiring at about the same time . A strike later this mont:1 against North American Aviation , Lockheed , Convair and Douglas , in partIcular , ? would hit a major part of the aerospace Industry ; these four companies together employ 125,000 union workers . Contracts with other big aerospace companies , such as Boeing Co. , United Aircraft Corp . and Aircraft Corp. , do not run out until September and after . A strike against North American , Lockheed , Convair and Douglas would have drastic effects on military and space projects . For instance , Douglas , as a major builder of military aircraft , is developing the Skybolt air-to-air missile , the Army 's Honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is building the Nike Zeus outer shell and the Hercules airframe . Among North American 's projects are several Navy and Air Force fighters and attack planes , development of the B-70 bomber , production ? of guidance systems for Polaris-armed nuclearpowered submarines , guidance systems for the Minuteman missile and development of the propulsion system for the National Aeronautics &; Space Administration 's Saturn space vehicle . Lockheed is involved with the Apollo and Nova space vehicles , the Polaris missile , a couple of heavy Air Force and Navy transports and the Agena missile , among others . Convalr Is producing the 13.58 jet bomber and the Atlas missile . Also , these companies have complements of workers at such Important missile bases as Cape Canaveral in Florida and Vandenhurg Air Force Base In California . Strikes would impair operations at these bases .
