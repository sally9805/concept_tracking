The archaic Connecticut law that bans the prescription or even the use of contraceptives in that state is now being challenged in the Supreme Court ( TIME , Dec. 18 ) . The fact that the law is stoutly supported by Connecticut 's <P> Roman Catholic clergy , whose flock comprises 46% of the state 's population , is theoretically of no concern to the court-but a little counterpressure never hurts . Last week it came from an unexpected source . The Catholic Council on Civil Liberties offered an amicus curiae ( friend of the court ) brief attacking the law and implying that it might trouble even Pope Paul VI . <P> " Though modest in size , " wrote Buffalo Lawyer Robert B. Fleming , the C.C.C.L. boasts Notre Dame 's Law School Dean Joseph O'Meara , Massachusetts ' former Attorney General Edward J. McCormack and the Rev. Benjamin L. Masse , associate editor of the Jesuit weekly America . Though it hardly speaks for the church , " hopefully it speaks for a Catholic point of view . " <P> In that view , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to recognize that marriage rights include " conjugal union as the expression of love . " Pope Paul himself recently said that in restudying its stand on birth control the church can not overlook " the feelings most close to the experience of man and woman . " Connecticut , said Fleming , is guilty of " profane interference " with just those feelings . <P> Judicial Lobbying . At first glance , C.C.C.L. might seem devoid of any right to argue a case to which it is not remotely a party . Originally , an amicus was simply a bystanding lawyer who offered a judge neutral legal advice . But as more and more private lawsuits began to affect public interests , amid became advocates , largely in appellate courts , for otherwise unrepresented third parties-business , labor , the states , even Congress . Today , amicus briefs may sometimes dwarf the arguments of nominal litigants-and be welcomed by courts as clarifiers of widely competing interests . <P> Almost since its founding in 1870 , the Justice Department has been the leading filer in federal courts of amicus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the N.A.A.C.P. began leading the way in 1909 , more and more minority groups have also found in court a chance for expression that eludes them at the ballot box . In 1945 , the American Jewish Congress started a legal arm that has since filed scores of amicus briefs not only concerned with Jewish causes but also with the rights of Catholics , Negroes and Puerto Ricans . No amicus quite matches the 44-year-old American Civil Liberties Union , which , under Executive Director John Pemberton Jr. , churns out briefs for people of any political persuasion . <P> Some amid see their briefs as frank lobbying-demonstration that powerful groups back an appellant 's cause . Indeed , such pressure flooded the Supreme Court in 1948 when 40 organizations filed for the Hollywood " unfriendly ten , " screenwriters who had been convicted of contempt of Congress . The court refused to review the case ( Lawson v. U.S. ) . Trade associations have also failed to snow the court with briefs trumpeting the size and power of their members . <P>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
