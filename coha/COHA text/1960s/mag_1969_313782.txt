Most self-made millionaires memorialize themselves by endowing schools and libraries , or giving to museums . <P> But not Dallas ' gruff , shrewd Real Estate Tycoon O. L. Nelms . For more than a decade , Nelms has placed advertisements in the personal columns of local papers saying , " Thank you , Dallas , for helping O L. Nelms make another million . " Now he has an even bigger and better idea : he is creating a $5,000,000 fund to provide huge public cocktail parties with free food and drink for anyone who wants to attend . By spending only the income Nelms can give several super swingers a year from now till the end of time . " This would be a real nice way to be remembered , " he says . <P> Other forms of self-commemoration do not appeal to Nelms . " I do n't believe in education , " he explained when college presidents tried to convince him that schools were nobler than booze . " I only went through the fourth grade myself-and I consider that the last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidy , he said , " If you folks would just put on hillbilly shows , you could be self-supporting . " <P> Nelms is already choosing a planning board to see to it that " none of these parties end after just a few token drinks . I want them to run as long as there 's a crowd there to have fun . " To house the parties , he recently purchased an office building near downtown Dallas and enough nearby land to provide an adequate parking lot . <P> There had to be a hitch , and there is . Although the parties will not start till after Nelms ' death , Nelms wants to enjoy them too . So , for every party , he has arranged with a local funeral home to have his remains wheeled out in a big silver casket . They will stay at the party until the last guest has gone . <P> O. L. Nelms is now a vigorous 61 , and is in excellent health . " But when he starts talking about those parties , " says an aide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's like he ca n't wait to die and get on with the fun . "
