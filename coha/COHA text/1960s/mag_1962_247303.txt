At his desk one morning recently , Teodoro Moscoso , the Puerto Rican development expert who now bosses the U.S. end of the Alliance for Progress , penned a bluntly worded memorandum to his staff . " On Aug. 17 , " said Moscoso , " we mark the first anniversary of the Alliance . We ' mark ' it . We do not celebrate it . There will be time enough to celebrate when we have achieved a working alliance and an extensive progress . As yet I am not satisfied that we have either . " <P> Moscoso 's candid memo amounted to official recognition of a disturbing fact . Seventeen months after President Kennedy 's stirring speech announcing the Alianza para el Progrcso , and a year after it was solemnly formalized by 20 hemisphere nations at Punta del Este , the program is in trouble . Latin Americans complain that the promised aid flows slowly . U.S. planners are discouraged by the manana attitude of many Latin American governments on the reciprocal social and economic reforms needed to make the U.S. aid dollars effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what the Alliance was going to do , and not enough hard work on how to achieve those high ambitions . <P> Misleading Figures . By Washington 's reckoning the aid figures are impressive-$866 million pumped into Latin America thus far , another $234 million earmarked . But the totals can be misleading . The U.S. has been sending aid to Latin America for years through a bevy of Government agencies : the Export-Import Bank , the Development Loan Fund , Point Four , and others . Lumped together , as they now are under the Alliance , these bits and pieces amounted to an average of $504 million each year in 1959 and 1960 . The $866 million total for the Alliance , when spread over 17 months , does not represent much of a real increase . <P> Until last November , when Puerto Rico 's Moscoso was picked to accelerate the Alliance , there was no central clearinghouse for aid requests . Washington 's lending agencies operated on their own , and the State Department , which was supposed to be in overall command , was plagued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge was Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Thomas Mann , who stayed on after the Eisenhower Administration left . Next came New Deal Brain-Truster Adolph Berle , who resigned soon after the disastrous Cuban invasion . Then it was Robert Woodward , a career diplomat who lasted eight months before going to Spain as U.S. ambassador . <P> Obstacle Course . Second-guessing all of them were the ubiquitous White House presidential advisers , chiefly Richard Goodwin , 30 , who seemed to have a hand in every Latin American decision . Only recently have things settled down . Last week Goodwin was in Europe setting up a " world conference on middle management " to help businessmen train second-echelon executives . In firm charge at last of Latin American policy is Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Edwin Martin , 54 , a career Government economist . Under him , Alliance Boss Moscoso seems to be getting the free hand he needs to make the Alliance work .                    @
