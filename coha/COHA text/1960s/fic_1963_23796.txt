The Man with Only One Suit A Story by JOHN ASHMEAD I REMEMBER the day I met Dr. Salzburger . That morning I had to interview a lady lion tamer . She rode a motorcycle in a deep circular pit made of wood . On her shoulder sat a lion as she rode round and round . At least that is the way I remember her act now , over sixteen years later , though it all seems very improbable . Surely you can not make a lion sit peacefully on your shoulders while you ride around . And the lion would weigh too much . I was only twenty-one then , a cub reporter . I enjoyed my work , but perhaps I was not a very good reporter . Often I got so excited and interested in what I was reporting that I forgot to write anything down . My City Editor said he frequently failed to find words for me . Once I covered a veterans ' convention and I began to ask myself why everyone stood patiently along the streets watching the veterans march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The veterans liked to touch the legs and bottoms of pretty girls with their electric canes . They never tried to shock older women . " Older women are unshockable , " a veteran shouted at me when I asked him . And he made a pretty young stenographer zoom two feet in the air . I watched the young stenographer walk down the street , tugging her slender girdle down . She seemed indignant and proud at the same time . Perhaps it was because she was still shockable . And then I began to watch the parade again and I began to think about what is the best way to arrange the three banks of oars on a trireme . It is a very profound question . Suddenly I had the illusion that I , Morris Babcock , would solve this question that had baffled scholars for so long . As I was about to read my paper before a World Congress of Trireme Scholars , a very angry man tapped me on the shoulder and said : " Look , do n't you see the flag ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a citizen of a foreign country ? " he asked . He was scowling at me . I had no answer . It was a very profound question , but the man was being sarcastic . Ile thought it was only a simple question . I stared at him , thinking he might be a genius , to ask a question like that . " Are you a citizen of a foreign country ? " One could take a week to answer . It all depends on what you mean by " foreign . " I was going to sell him to calm down because I was n't wearing a hat . And usually that answer would have been true . 1 do n't like hats and I never wear one , unless it rains . Suddenly I remembered that morning I had put on a hat , thinking it might rain . But it was a fine day , and I had forgotten all about the hat . Now I remembered that when the flag goes by you must take off your hat . I wanted to explain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WITH ONLY ONE SUIT ing to rain , and about forgetting I had a hat on , but it was useless . He was angry , and perhaps , in his opinion , I was a spy . Spies probably keep their hats on , no matter what flag goes by . " Like this , " he said , and he held his hat over his heart . Then I remembered it was not enough to take your hat off when the flag went by . You had to hold it over your heart too . For some reason I did not want to hold my hat over my heart . It was just a shabby old brown hat anyway . Even holding it over my heart would not make it look any better . I pretended I wanted some coffee and went into a restaurant . There I had to take my hat off , of course . In a restaurant you take your hat off but you do not have to hold it over your heart . While I was drinking coffee with my hat in my lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very cross at me . I still think about banks of oars , sometimes , especially when a flag goes by . T H E City Editor was not cross at me about the lady lion tamer . I thought at first it was because I had turned in a good interview . But really it was because of what some people would call a shameful incident . A photographer had gone with me to photograph the lions and their lady lion tamer . We were looking at the lions in their cages . The photographer asked how you could tell a boy baby lion from a female baby lion . " Is it so difficult to tell men from women ? " the lady lion tamer asked . She meant it sarcastically but it was really a profound question . I was thinking about her question , when all of a sudden the lady lion tamer yelled : " Look out ! " When the lady lion tamer yelled " Look out ! " I had been staring at the wooden pit in which the lady lion tamer rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set it up , and why the lions did n't climb up the sides and escape . That is what I would have done if I had been a lion . Riding around in a circle always makes me sick . I turned round , facing the lion cages . A lioness urinated toward me . It was a heavy musky smell , but not as unpleasant as you might expect . In fact most of it landed on my suit , which is part of myself , but not really myself . Since my father had picked the suit out , it was n't even my style . You could n't have told anything about me if you only had my suit to go by . Actually urine is a mild antiseptic , I believe , even lioness urine . It was a shameful incident only if you did n't know about urine , as I did . The photographer who was with me thought it was very funny . I laughed too , but not as much as I usually do when something is very funny . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urine in my interview . My newspaper called itself " The Friend of the Family . " The City Editor had posted a list near his desk , of " Do 's and Don't 's for the Friend of the Family . " It was a long list , but there was nothing in it objecting to lioness urine . Ti was unnecessary , as the City Editor said to me , to spell out " every goddamned syllable . " Now the City Editor called me over and said he wanted to congratulate me . I , Morris Babcock , was the first goddamned reporter on our friendly newspaper , or the first goddamned reporter on our chain of friendly newspapers , who had been urinated on by a lion in the course of his duties . The City Editor had given me several lectures on accuracy . He made his lectures easy for me to remember because he always pounded on his desk when he came to the word " accuracy . " Now 1 said , " Lioness . " That made him laugh even snore . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salzburger , because it was a great relief to go out of the office that afternoon to interview him . My suit had a musky odor , and the reporters kept coming around and sniffing . Then they roared like so many lions . I could n't do anything about the odor because I had only one suit . The suit was like those of the other reporters , and it had broad padded shoulders , much broader than my own shoulders . After that experience I wanted to earn enough money to have two suits . Then I could wear one while the other was being cleaned . But salaries were low on our friendly family newspaper . The other reporters told me we did not join the reporters ' union so we could he independent . If you joined a union you lost your independence and had two suits . Or so I was beginning to reason , in a somewhat tentative way . And if it had not been for the lioness I might not have been allowed to keep on interviewing Dr. Salzburger . The City Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lioness incident he John Ashmead 's first novel ( 1961 ) was " The Mountain and the Feather . " He was a Naval officer in World War 11 and later earned a Ph.D . at Harvard . Fri ! bright lectureships have when him to Japan and Taiwan , and he has also taught at Athens College in Greece . The Ashmeads have five children and live at Haverford , where he is associate professor of English . kept use around so he could tell the story to all his friends . It would not be so funny if I had just been fired . And then too I was a Phi Beta Kappa , and the editor liked to say that I was probably the only goddamned Phi Beta Kappa in America who had been urinated on by a lioness in the course of his duties . Of course a Phi Beta Kappa has no duties . A Phi Beta Kappa does not even have a secret handshake . And a Phi Beta Kappa key is not solid gold . It just looks like solid gold . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great shock , not that I minded the money so much . Dr. Salzburger was a famous psychiatrist , but not a Phi Beta Kappa because he came from Germany . He had come to work in our city at the Rest Home , a place for wealthy patients . Actually it was not a " Rest Home " but what my City Editor called " a goddamned bughouse . " I was very interested in psychoanalysis and psychiatry myself . A man with only one suit can not afford to go to a psychiatrist , so at the age of twelve I tried to psychoanalyze myself . My father calls himself a practical electrical engineer and somehow I did not tell him when I went up to our attic , pulled down the shades , lay back on the attic sofa and consulted myself . After a month I gave up , partly because the attic sofa had one leg missing and I was sick of looking for it everywhere . But I had a very high opinion of psychoanalysis all the same . I was eager to interview Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent me out on fairly uninteresting stories . Often they wanted only the first paragraph of what I wrote . " That 's why you must put everything in the first goddamned paragraph , " shouted my editor . In fact one of my main jobs was to clip out stories from our rival newspaper , a morning paper . I went through these morning stories carefully , changing the active to the passive voice and vice versa . That evening on the rival paper a cub reporter like myself changed our passive voices back to active and vice versa . That way there was no danger of plagiarism , and we could print each other 's stories . It was the passive voice that made our jobs possible , if you stopped to think about it . I felt it would be too difficult to explain to Dr. Salzburger about being a cub reporter and about the passive voice . His English was not very good . And then , perhaps because he thought I was Jewish , he took a liking to me , and I did not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , though some of my best friends are Gentiles , but I first learned I looked Jewish when my father took me to a Jewish tailor after my first communion . My father wanted to buy site a new suit of clothes . Whenever my father was excited he liked to buy a suit of clothes , usually on credit . Perhaps my first communion made my father think of when he himself was a boy , and that made him excited . Later on my father would be less excited , and the tailor would realize that he would not be paid . Then sometimes my father had to give back the suit of clothes . That was during the Depression . So there was a double excitement , buying the new suit , and wondering how long I would be allowed to keep it . I can remember each suit I have had , no matter how short the actual time I wore it , because with each new suit my personality seemed to change a little . At my first communion it was a gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too old for a boy of fourteen . But it made me feel , wrongly , I see now , that I might become a businessman . Perhaps , without realizing it himself , my father bought me a businessman 's suit so I would not have any silly ideas about entering electrical engineering ( which was then in a state of collapse ) or the church . 68 THE MAN WITH ONLY ONE SUIT But at my first communion 1 had not actually thought about religion at all , though I had every intention of thinking about it . I was thinking of stories my communion teacher , a nephew of the bishop who was to confirm me , had told his communion class ; perhaps that was why he was bored with the catechism , because he had it around his uncle 's house all the time . When we were supposed to be reading the catechism he told us the story of Dido and Aeneas and how they made love in a cave while there was a thunderstorm outside . His story made me eager to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more interesting in the bishop 's nephew 's version . So when the bishop put his hand on my head , in spite of myself , I did not think of the communion service in which I was really very much interested . After the communion service my father took me to breakfast at a hotel . We ate griddlecakes and sausages , and the sirup came in a small silver jug , instead of a glass bottle with the price stamped on it , the way we always served it at home . So there were many things to remember that day besides the remark of the tailor . Of course , later on , it was mainly the tailor 's remark I remembered , and I almost forgot it had been the day of my first communion . The tailor had known my father a long time . My father did not like to pay hills in cash , or even later on the first of the month . He felt that if you used your credit only when you were hard up , people would get suspicious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . He always stretched his credit to the hi eaking point , as he said , to prepare for a rainy day . The tailor had learned that my father would lend money to anyone with a hard-luck story . Instead of asking for his bill , which was hopeless , the tailor borrowed money from my father for one imaginary disaster after another . The result was that their accounts were so involved that neither one knew who owed what , except that each secretly believed the other owed more . Just recently the tailor had come to my father 's house and borrowed $10 from him , to fix his car which he said had stopped down the street . My mother was very cross . " You are a soft touch , " she said . Of course his car stopped  --  when he got out of it . " My mother gave the church a fixed amount each week , and she hated what she called a soft touch . Now when we were buying the communion suit , perhaps the tailor thought of the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning itwas my first communion , " You call him a Christian boy ? " The remark had a double meaning , since the tailor was thinking that with the new suit he would once again he behind in the account by his reckoning , but my father thought it referred only to my profile which was very long-nosed . I looked in the tailor 's mirrors which were arranged to show the customers their suits from every position . These mirrors also showed one 's profile from every position too and you could get a good idea of how long your nose was , if that was one of your problems . Now I looked at my profile as though it belonged to someone else . " You call him a Christian boy ? " my father repeated . echoing the tailor 's pronunciation . And he liked to repeat the remark later on to company , especially at family parties , in a very broad Yiddish accent , much broader than the tailor 's accent had been . In one sense I was lucky to have been born a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic to Jews , but not in the same way that a Christian with a Jewish nose is sympathetic to Jews . After I went to college I learned that there was no such thing as a Jewish nose , let alone a Jewish race . The college sociologists had solved that question . Their answer was n't much use outside the college classroom , but as the sociology text put it , sociology was still an infant science . Y father would have known immediately that Dr. Salzburger was a Jew . Dr. Salzburger had the profile of a Christian movie actor , and could easily have fooled my sociology teacher , but not my father . My father would have liked Dr. Salzburger , and he might even , after a long time , have invited him to the house for dinner . And my father would have asked Dr. Salzburger immediately how he had managed to escape from Germany . He would have known at once that Dr. Salzburger was a German Jewish refugee . I never thought of anything interesting like that at all . It Tiwas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is what I call the Phi Beta Kappa curse . Instead I asked Dr. Salzburger if he had any hobbies . I often did interviews of people for our newspaper . It was the job of the cub reporter . It was supposed to be the worst job , that was why the cub reporter got it . But I really liked to talk to the old men who had just reached their eightieth birthday and could still go by themselves to the bathroom . They were very proud of that . Their friends who were still alive had to be helped , they told me . When I came back and told the City Editor this , he said we could n't use that sort of thing in a family newspaper , and why did n't I ask about their " goddamned hobbies . " Then I would go back to the old men . I became something of an expert in old men 's hobbies , and after a while I got the impression that all over the city the old men were patiently building cathedrals out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him about his hobbies , because in addition to being a psychiatrist he was also a mathematical wizard . He could do all sorts of sums in his head , and once he had even been Einstein 's assistant . In fact , he had a problem which only he and Einstein could solve . He would be glad to give this problem to our paper , if we were interested . Dr. Salzburger told me he was a man with his finger in a million pies . Although his English was not very good I liked it because you always had to think about what he said , When Dr. Salzburger said he did n't believe in keeping all his egg in one basket , you would miss his next sentence because you wanted to think about that one . He played some of his phonograph records for me , special phonograph records made at U. S. Navy expense . He was working on a project for our Navy . Young Navy fliers told him all their childhood dreams . He kept a phonograph record of these stories . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most successful fliers had . He thought the most successful fliers always dreamed about flying when they were very young . And the least successful fliers dreamed about something else . ( I suppose the war which was about to start ruined this experiment of 1 ) r . Salzburger . Because a lot of the most successful fliers died in the carrier battles . And the least successful fliers were given ground duty , and usually they lived through the war . So from one point of view it was better not to dream about flying when you were a child . ) Dr. Salzburger described only one of his private patients at the Rest Home as a failure . I was curious to see a patient who could hold out against Dr. Salzburger . " He thinks he is a Flying Teacup , " said Dr. Salzburger crossly . Obviously this was a sore point . When I went back to the newspaper late that afternoon , I told the City Editor about Dr. Salzburger . The City Editor sniffed at my only suit , which I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he roared like a lion . Perhaps that was why he agreed to let me do a series of articles on Dr. Salzburger . So really if it had not been for the lady lion tamer and my one suit I might never have gotten to know Dr. Salzburger as well as I did . It is not always a misfortune to have only one suit . I I ) I D not really expect my City Editor to print a series of articles on Dr. Salzburger . In news value he was no match for a lady lion tamer , or the old men I talked with who went to the bathroom by themselves and made cathedrals out of toothpicks . But I wanted an excuse to see more of Dr. Salzburger , and I was too shy to think I could make friends with a man like him on my own account . %Vhen I first began to interview him , Dr. Salzburger looked at me very seriously and said , " I am a Jew too . " Even though Dr. Salzburger was a scientist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later he would find out that I was not a Jew . I was a Christian who spelled god with a small g . Now he told me he was a German Jewish refugee . He had just escaped from Germany in time to save his life . But his wife , who was not Jewish , had stayed in Germany . Dr. Salzburger explained that his wife could not bear to leave her relatives . He and his wife both agreed it would he safer for her if she divorced him . And it was out of the question for Dr. Salzburger and his wife to write to each other . He was very upset as he told me this . " She is stronger than I am , " he said : " she has an almost inhuman strength . I might have stayed in Germany even so . But she divorced me . " When Dr. Salzburger talked of Hitler he became very excited . He walked up and down , waving one hand in the air . He kept the other hand tucked in his waistcoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to think of Hitler as a real person . Dr. Salzburger was not excited because he wanted to kill Hitler or anything like that . He was too much of a scientist . He wanted to psychoanalyze Hitler . " I would go back to Germany , " he said , " if only they would let me analyze Hitler back to the time when he was five years old . Then let them send me to the gas chamber . " The crucial age , he explained , waving his Free hand in the air , was age five . " After age five , " he said , " what was once a little man turns into a child again . " What he meant was that at age five the little man matures and sees clearly that he must kill his father and sleep with his mother . Like Oedipus . 70 THE MAN WITH ONLY ONE SUIT I had read Oedipus Rex at college , and it was interesting to think of Oedipus as really five years old . Perhaps the play Oedipus Rex would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pageant . " After age five , " said Dr. Salzburger , " you burn all your rivers behind you . " Then , it seemed , the little Oedipus in each and every one of us went back to his building blocks and crayons and repressions . " Put on childish things , " he said . " That is the way to freedom . " Perhaps Dr. Salzburger had trouble with his patient , the Flying Teacup , because the Flying Teacup 's phantasies were from his adult and not from his childish period . " Confess , " said Dr. Salzburger to him crossly . " Take a weight off your chest . Put on childish things . " But the Flying Teacup had no desire to go back to age five and put on childish things . He was much more interested in what had just happened to him recently , when he made his first space trip . IIe and Dr. Salzburger used to get very excited about the Flying Teacup 's refusal to go back to age five , Dr. Salzburger thought space trips were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame Dr. Salzburger for getting impatient with the man he called the Flying Teacup . It was not easy to understand about Crax , since that was the name for the country the Flying Teacup had visited , and it was also the name the Craxmen used for earth , and even earthmen could also be called Craxmen . The Flying Teacup was a good mimic , and as he told about Crax , he imitated each person he had met in Crax . Their language was very ambiguous , to say the least . For hours the Craxmen sat and looked at each other , without the need for conversation . Then they talked for a little while to each other , but without any real hope of being understood . I could have gone on for some time , talking to Dr. Salzburger and to the Flying Teacup . But my City Editor got impatient . He wanted a story about that " goddamned loony doctor . " And , as the City Editor explained to me , he wanted the story before he or Dr. Salzburger died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Salzburger 's wife because it might endanger her life . And we could not print the story about the Flying Teacup because of Professional Ethics . The City Editor was very cross . " Well , what about his goddamned hobbies ? " he shouted at me . And he sent me out with a photographer who was having trouble with his wife . I was to get the story about the problem that only Einstein and Dr. Salzburger could solve . We left the office at eight o'clock in the morning . The photographer just missed colliding with several other cars , and finally he just missed colliding with the City Bank . From time to time he referred to the newspaper car as his " chariot . " He called himself Ben Hur . Or sometimes he was " Ben Hors only friend . " The photographer apologized for taking an unusually bad turn around the Colosseum ( actually it was the railroad station ) and said it was because of his domestic troubles . If he only had some beer he would stop thinking about his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photographer in a glass of beer or he would not drink any . " I never drink alone , " he said . That way , he warned me , you could easily become an alcoholic . The City Editor , he explained , was an alcoholic . " I am a drunk , " he said proudly . " Not a crummy alcoholic . " Just as the photographer said , the beer made the photographer forget his wife , and he felt much better . But I felt much worse . We arrived at Dr. Sahiburger 's office at about 9:00 A.M. , and the photographer took his pictures . Then Dr. Salzburger gave us the problem that only Einstein and he could do . I did not trust myself after all that beer , and I read the problem back to Dr. Salzburger . He said I had it right , but of course his English was still not very good . Then he gave us some more problems to show how fast he could solve them . By now Dr. Salzburger was very excited , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of a psychiatrist , and he made mistakes in some of these problems . He even got so excited he offered a reward of $100 to anyone who solved the problem that only he and Einstein could do . W E printed the whole story , with all the problems , and the offer of a $100 reward . Our noon edition had not been out on the streets more than fifteen minutes before a little girl called up . She said she had solved the problem that only Einstein and Dr. Salzburger could do . Her name , she said , was Susan Glotz , and her closest friends called her Susy . She needed $100 immediately for jelly beans . Then other people called up who had solved the problem . They promised to pick up their S100 in person from the City Editor . And then telegrams came in , sacks of them . all solving the problem . Later in the afternoon there was the Special Delivery mail . And the next day ordinary letters , sack piled up on sack . My guess was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the first sack of telegrams my City Editor called me over . " Have you made a goddamned mistake ? " he shouted at mc . " You try to solve it , " I said in a dignified way . But the City Editor could n't solve it , perhaps because he was so excited . I could n't solve it either , but I ca n't solve any mathematical problems at all . I did not like to hear a pencil break and look up and see the City Editor glowering at me . It was a very unpleasant sensation . I went out and helped an old man put some toothpicks in a cathedral . Dr. Salzburger did not read the newspapers until evening . Then he saw at once what the trouble was . I had left out a comma in a crucial place , and of course , when I read the problem back to Dr. Salzburger , I did not say " comma " every time I came to a comma . To do that makes even Shakespeare sound silly ? " To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . " Even a nonmathematical wizard like myself could see that without the comma Dr. Salzburger owed over a million dollars . With the comma he owed nothing The second day the City Editor was even more excited , especially after he had to go in and have a talk with the Managing Editor . The Managing Editor came out to the city room and glared at mc . He broke his pencil in two and flung it in the wastebasket . Then the Managing Editor went hack into his office . It was the first time I had ever seen the Managing Editor . " Do you realize you can get us all put in a goddamned jail ? " the City Editor screamed at me . I was going to tell the City Editor not to worry , Dr. Salzburger would not sue us , we Jews always stuck together . Then I suddenly remembered that 1 was not a Jew after all . The City Editor forbade me to have anything more to do with Dr. Salzburger . He sent the newspaper 's lawyer out to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about leaving out the comma , the newspapers would forget about reminding its readers that Dr. Salzburger had made mistakes in the other problems . We would just publish the correct version with an apology . Dr. Salzburger said it would be all right , he had been a young man himself and he did not want to get me in any trouble . And then , he said , he knew how hard it was sometimes for a Jew to get a job . That was when Dr. Salzburger learned that I was not a Jew after all . But we stuck together anyway . " It does not matter , " said Dr. Salzburger . " We are human beings . " When we published Dr. Salzburger 's problem in the correct form nobody solved it . Ehe reason only Einstein and Dr. Salzburger could solve it was very simple . The question was put in terms of ordinary numbers , but the answer had to be in logarithms . Only Einstein and Dr. Salzburger knew about that . We got even more telegrams about the answer , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuss about the problems , both the right version and the wrong one , might affect business at the Rest Home . But actually Dr. Salzburger spotted all sorts of in-telegrams about the answer than about the grams that were sent to him , especially when our readers found out about the logarithms . The City Editor wanted to fire me right then and there , but he still had some friends who had not heard about the lioness yet . Just as he ran out of friends , the war came and I enlisted . The City Editor himself put a blue star in the flag the newspaper had tacked to the wall for its war veterans . If anything happened to me , they would change the blue star to a gold star . I thought it would be all right , now I had left the newspaper , to go out to the Rest Home and say good-by to Dr. Salzburger. 72 THE MAN WITH ONLY ONE SUIT Dr. Salzhurger shook hands with me , and looked at me very carefully . Then he said , You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish , but sometimes he mixed up the words Jewish and Kosher . And of course in a sense I was not really Kosher so it was an interesting question . A profound question really . A F T E R the war I stayed in the Army for several years . When I resigned I bought a gray flannel suit that had no padding in the shoulders at all . That was the fashion then , about the time the newspapers were full of stories about Flying Saucers from Other Planets . The stories made me think of Dr. Salzburger and his patient he had called the Flying Teacup . I went to the Rest Home and asked to see Dr. Salzburger . The trustees had allowed him to retire in one of the " goddamned cells , " as my editor had called them . Now an attendant touched his forefinger to his head , and said mysteriously , " Napoleon . " The attendant stuck one hand inside his white jacket , and waved the other hand in the air , in Dr. Saliburger 's old , familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " warned the attendant , They met again in Germany at the end of the war ? " I asked . " To figure out the best pension plan , you have to take your wife into consideration , " said the attendant . " But he never talks of her . " 1 could not believe that Dr. Sal/burger , a man who had every neurosis in the world at his fingertips , would choose Napoleon , the most common illusion of all . I was sure it . was some joke of his . We greeted each other like Very friendly strangers . He seemed much the same , though lie had the nodding head of a very old man , the kind I used to interview for my paper some fifteen years ago . He recalled with relish the problem that only he and Einstein could solve . Two spots of color appeared in his wrinkled cheeks , and I began to wonder if I was tiring him out . " So many new patients , " he said , and smiled as though at some private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks and we sat quietly without talking , almost like inhabitants of the Flying Teacup 's other world . His head nodded . Something stirred in his mind . He took my arm for a moment and held it with all his strength , " Do n't wait so long to see me the next time , " he said mysteriously . " We are human beings . It 's much clearer to me now . " He waved at his stacks of scientific journals , as though he knew at last their true voice , their final word . He stuck his hand in his waistcoat , like Napoleon , " It amuses them " he said . " A whiff of grapeshot . " We both laughed . A mischievous , childish look crossed his face , as though a fiveyear-old child were looking through an old man 's mask . " Well , " he said , " now you have met my Waterloo . " I got up to go . " Good-by , Dr. Salzburger , " said . He whispered , " Put on childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant , who had been waiting for me at the door . " You sec . " The Flying Teacup had gray hair . He too had become an old man . He refused to say a word to me . The attendant told me the Flying Teacup regarded me as a spy who had stolen from him the secrets of Grax . I sat with him for a while , and I began to wonder if he had even noticed my presence at all . Then he began to imitate the gestures , the facial expression , and the walk of a middle-aged , stoop-shouldered man . He said nothing , still , and at first I did not realize he was doing an imitation of me in my new civilian suit . Then he tapped his nose . When the Flying Teacup saw that I recognized myself , he rushed to a corner of his room , sat on the floor , and howled with laughter , as if all the laughter of the world had rushed into his corner of the room , inside himself . I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that unlike Dr. Sal/burger and myself he had stayed young , he would always be the same age , here was the real secret of his strange , mysterious land . He was inhuman . Thinking of Dr. Salzburger , whom I liked very much , I began drawing a sketch , while I waited for my bus , of how I would arrange the oars on a five-banked ship , on a quinquereme . While I drew , I began to ask myself why we say " sadder and wiser " and " sorrow and laughter . " It is actually a very profound question . Somewhat impatiently , I tried still another arrangement of the oars , in diagonals of fives . As I drew , I wondered what Dr. Salzburger 's wife had looked like , when they both were young , and I wandered what my father had been like , when he was a boy , with only one suit . ( I have several suits now . ) For Dr. Salzburger and myself , always growing older , the world was a field across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . We were all too human . I tried a more plausible arrangement of the oars . Somewhere in my mind , flags started going by . Harper 's Magazine , April 1963
