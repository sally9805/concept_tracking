, suddenly and unexpectedly , asked him , " Mr. Collier , do n't you care at all what we think of you ? " " Not at all , " he said , and laughed without inhibition . Naturally I looked for a nervous edge to his laughter , but there was none . I remember Gwen was laughing too , and he was speaking to her , again past me : " I knew what to expect when I said I 'd see him . I do n't want him to write favorably about me  --  it would cost me a lot of votes . " And more of that not very funny crap . Finally he said to Gwen , " Come on , let 's go get some sun and see how the animals are doing . " And he took her by the elbow and led her out . I followed . About this time I detected a contrary twinge in my feelings for this creature . I have never had a spontaneous laugh , and always wished I did . I choked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly as I could . It was n't right ; I should n't admire this man in any way . We walked around his acreage . There was a Ford Farmall tractor parked not far from his front door next to our U-drive . There was no lawn , just field grass . And mud . Collier had on some kind of boots , I my city shoes . Gwen was shod strictly Italian , with the thinnest possible soles . He sent someone into the house to get her a pair of galoshes and lifted her into them himself . They were too big , and she looked very cute . He offered me no such courtesy . The trees we were walking under were very old . So were the house and the outbuildings . It had been rather chilly inside  --  he kept it that way in the fashion of English country gentlemen  --  very cool indeed from my point of view . I wondered if Southern California had thinned my blood . At any rate , the sun was welcome . The domestic animals were all out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight cats and six dogs of different breeds , high bred as well as mongrel . The place was crawling with these animals , all walking around among each other , feeding various ways , quarreling as was natural , fornicating , reproducing and nursing . There were puppies and there were kittens . The scene was Brueghel . The animals were as at home as the humans . Collier led us around the back of the house to some cages where he kept wild animals . There was a weasel which he had just caught in a Have-a-Heart trap . We watched him transfer the animal to larger quarters . There was a bob-cat with a bad foot which he had rescued from the trap of a neighboring farmer , a jaguar kitten that a friend40had sent him from Caracas , and a large bedraggled hawk that looked well past its prime ( Collier said it was ) and was content , I thought , not to be any longer at liberty ( Collier winked at Gwen and said I was projecting ) . Again I have to admit I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of animals around , but Florence had pointed out , quite correctly , that our lives would be restricted by them . " I mean , " she used to say , " suppose we want to take a trip suddenly ? What would we do with them ? " What did Collier do with them when he took his trips ? I supposed they just stayed there and ate each other . I was about to ask him , when I noticed that he had taken off his lumber jacket ( the sun had gone behind some clouds and the temperature had dropped abruptly ) and was putting it around Gwen 's shoulders . The son of a bitch was making a run for my girl ! Well , by this time I was ready to kill him . But that was only the beginning . He got onto subjects that he knew would outrage me . And make me write pure murder about him . First he started on the Jews . He said he found that most American Jews were ashamed of it . What did I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews considered those girls of their tribe the prettiest who looked most Christian . What did I think of that ? Nonsense , I said . By now he was interviewing me . He said Jews always married girls who looked the least Jewish , preferring those with pretty little turned up noses , and if they did n't have noses like that , their fathers would rush them to get a nose bob and , while they were at it , an electrolysis of the upper lip to get rid of their mustaches . What did I think of that ? Pure prejudice , I said . He said he approved of the Black Muslims . Did I ? I said no , I did n't . He said that he could n't see how the mass of Negroes managed to be so patient . That if he had been a Negro , he would have turned to murder long ago , would n't I ? No , I said . He said the only way they 'd get respect from Whitey was with their fists ; they had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did I agree with that ? 41Not at all , I said . He said that he did n't believe in all that non-violent twitter because the only way history moves is through blood-letting  --  look at our history  --  and did n't I at least agree with that ? I said I certainly did n't . He was really enjoying himself , the bastard . Well , he said , did I really think that all that hymn singing , those preacher-politicians , and those long herd walks were really doing any good ? I said , most certainly yes . He burst into laughter and said I deserved what I was going to get , and that he 'd ask me one more question : did I really and truly want the Negro to have absolute equality in this country , to examine my conscience and tell him , did I truly want that ? I said I did n't know what he meant . Of course I did . He turned to Gwen and said to her , " Come on , I 'll show you something , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull myselftogether and tell myself to be patient , I 'd get him later  --  with my typewriter . He showed us his two racing cars , a Porsche Spyder and an old Maserati , beautifully kept up . By now he was talking only to Gwen . " How come you 're speaking only to my researcher and not to me ? " I said . " Well , you 're not interested in racing cars , are you ? " I said no , I was n't , but neither was she . " Yes , " he said , " but she 's interested in me . " We all laughed . What the hell was I laughing at ? A bit later he got out his Australian bull whip , and did some target practice , making an old oil can jump around . ( He must have known I 'd make a fool of him on that bull whip bit . ) And then his pistol , did I want to do some shooting ? I said no , I did n't approve of guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our friend does n't approve of guns . " He was doing everything possible to bait me . So I just tuned him out . I began to write the piece in my mind . That gave me comfort . The son of a bitch was a fraud , and I was going to pull that big damp stone off from over him and let the light of day hit him . He was able to live the way he lived for one reason only : his father had left him a bundle . Disguised under all that romantic roostering was the soul of a coupon-clipper . He 'd never earned one42cent himself . For all that farm life he was parading before us , he was a bourgeois slob , just as bad on his end as those Hollywood Cadillac Communists were on the other . I came to . He and Gwen were both looking at me . When he noticedI was paying attention again , he said to Gwen , " Miss Gwen , do n't you think they might at least have sent an unprejudiced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fair-minded . Why was I surprised that she had defended me ? They were standing there , side by side . I saw her look at him a certain way , and I realized she liked him . I guess it was his candor . And some kind of male exuberance . His step had bounce , and his stance was fearless . He faced men combatively , and women as if they were his natural quarry . At one point he admitted that he was a womanizer and said , " Put that down for him , Miss Gwen , an admitted adulterer , a man who lives in the corruptnew suburbs and does n't go to work but spends his days talking , farming , drinking , reading , and pursuing his neighbors ' women . Oh I forgot politics , " he winked at me , " and I do n't lie to myself . And oh , " he said , " I 'll give you another one . Write this down for him , Miss Gwen , my favorite author is Kipling . How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you could have made up , is n't it ? Come on , I 'll read for you . " And goddam if he did n't . He got out a book of Kipling 's verse and kept us there drinking his bone dry martinis long past dark . He turned on only one light , so we could n't do anything except listen to him reading that stuff rhythmically , in an old-fashioned sing-song style , beautiful in its way it was , but who reads that stuff any more  --  and in that way ? He even read " Boots . " Then somebody brought in tea and a nut cake he claimed he had baked himself that morning , in anticipation of my visit , he said , just to surprise me , and to give me , if I liked the cake , at least one good thing I could say about him . " Just for relief , " he said , " from the rest of that bilge , one friendly homely note ? " I ate my cake and did n't answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview , was he trying to be so far out that I 'd think him in ? We all had a lot to drink . He began to talk about chaos , his favorite theme . He really rolled out on that , the importance of recognizingthe element of chaos in life and how important it was to43look that one in the eye as early as possible and be prepared to meet what was going to happen , prepared for hatred and conflict and confusionand no-happy-ending and no-victory-for-the-just . He said we all spoil our children by protecting them too much . He said we should encourage them to have fist fights early on , because that way they would be ready for what was ahead . Then he took out after our schools . Especially the progressive private schools , with their emphasis on adjustment . He was drunk by then , and the room was pretty dark , and he roared , " Anybody who 's adjusted to the way this country is today is an idiot , and a man who tries to train his children to adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their throats . " His voice was going up and down in a sort of chant . He was getting out of control . He moved over and sat next to Gwen on the sofa , barely recognizing my presence . I believe he could have made love to her with me right there and maybe would have tried , except that he could n't tell what Gwen felt . She certainly did n't move away ( I knew she would n't give him that ) , but she was looking at him in that cool way , measuring him for something , it was n't clear what . It was at this point that I said , " Gwen let 's go , " and he bellowed out , " No , you 're going to spend the night here ; we 're just getting started . " I had had enough . " Come on , Gwen , " I said , picking up her things . Somehow we got out of there . I could n't wait to attack him . I assumedGwen and I would feast on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean sexually , although the fact is that in women all feelings mix together  --  sex , intellectual judgment and all  --  in one big ragout . Whatever the components , she liked him . Was it because he came on with her ? She asked what it was I did n't like about him . I said , " Everything . He 's prejudiced and bigoted , a reactionary politically , socially , and philosophically , an arrogant super male with his goddam fornicating animals and penis symbols all over the place  --  whips , guns , racing cars  --  and that phony country gentleman air . And Kipling ! That 's where he belonged  --  in His Majesty 's Khyber Rifles ! " I was yelling at her , but she looked at me with cool interest and said , " Yes , I see what you mean . I guess you 're right . But I like him . " I said just because he came on with you , and her answer was , yes , 44that was enjoyable , she did enjoy that . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell the man is just a filthy ram , did you smell him ? By now we were back at the Algonquin  --  and I got so worked up I took her in anger . When we were done , she said , " Well , thank you , Chet Collier , " just as a joke , but I could n't see where it was so funny . We left for California the next day , this time by plane . I was furious with her and did n't really know why . I was doubting something about myself that I had never before opened to doubt : my judgment , my basic point of view , my taste , my stance in the world . I 'd say Collier was a mass of prejudice ( I was beginning to write the piece now ) , and Gwen would say that it was I who was prejudiced , that I had written my piece in advance , had never given the man a chance , had gone to interview him with every judgment made . I had pre-judged him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . And I roared . Well , one afternoon I was going on about Collier 's sexual selfadvertising , how he was pushing his product all the time , strutting his macho and rattling his cohones ( we 'd just done it in Gwen 's apartment , and were maybe getting up to the point of doing it again ) , when Gwen began to giggle and my male column collapsed . " What the hell are you laughing about ? " I said . " You do the same damned thing . " " The hell I do . " She called my attention to the running commentary with which I often accompanied our love making . She said what the hell , it 's just natural and sort of charming , most men do it , say something during the act , and in some way ask for compliments afterwards , just natural she said . With me , she said , it sometimes even reached the level of boasting . I said , getting pretty teed off now , when the hell was I ever boasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance you always ask , Are you comingagain , my darling ? ' What do you call that if it 's not boasting ? Are n't you calling attention to how good you are ? And that condescendingbaby voice you use on me . Are you coming again , my sweetheart , ' " she imitated me . Well , this made me really blow . I could n't do it to her for a week after that , the bitch ! A woman is not supposed to do that ! A male45ego is a fragile thing and has to be sustained , not put down . Gwen has been around enough to know that , I thought , so she must be doing it on purpose . That 's it . She 's attacking me for some reason . One day I read her some of what I 'd written and she acted bored , getting up once to open a window , another time to get an orange stick , which she began to use . So I finally quit . When I scolded her , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I said what the hell was wrong with me ? She said my whole way of life . And I said , ready now to kill , what was wrong with my whole way of life ? She said I should for once in my life live what I talked . " Put your money , " she said , " where your mouth is . For example , " she said , " I 'm pretty damned tired of your beefing about the middle class all the time . I do n't even know what it is , those bourgeoisie you talk about , which is only a hangover from your left days or something . Who lives more middle class than you do , with your insurance , your cocktails at seven , your dinner at seven-thirty , and your respectable civil-rights-loving wife , and the same executive-type haircut your friends have and the same executive-type friends and the same suits they have , and the whole damned thing  --  your lawn , do n't let me forget your lawn  --  and you go bitching and complaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists  --  is n't that what you are ? I mean if you 'd shut up and enjoy it , I could take you . I mean you 're part of the general fraud ; why pretend to be better ? You sit here and draw yours twice a month , a big fat check it is too , from an industry whose only function is to sell people things they do n't need , and you do it by lying about them , and you know it , and you think just because you subscribe to a couple of those magazines like the Nation it makes everything all right . You constantly bitch about the establishment  --  what the hell is the establishment except you ? I mean why do n't you just be a slob like everyone else and enjoy it , you 'd have a hell of a lot better time . That 's my advice ! " " What else ? " I said , ready to murder , egging her on . " What else ? " " Everything , " she said , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so why do n't you be nice to your fellow phonies ? They 're no worse than you , only different . They buy their neckties in the same place , mix their drinks the same way , turn in their cars once a year like you do , and all have their little piece of tail they 're doing on the side just like you do me . And they lie to her about maybe someday46marrying her , and they do n't mean it , any more than you did when you said all that crap to me that night . They just play the game , and you play the game . " I blew up . " If you do n't like it , what the hell are you doing here ? " " Because I 'm no different and no better , " she said . " How could I be ? I 'm dependent on you phonies for my living . And you , at least you personally  --  " " Are just a little better than the others ? " " I was n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a little more . You 're anxious or something , so you cling to me a little more . " She leaned forward to touch my cheek . " And you are sort of sweet . . . " I brushed her away and said , " Never mind that . Finish what you were going to say . " " No , " she said , " now you 're sore at me . And I do n't want you to be sore at me . You 're not so bad , despite the fact that you 've been conning me all along . It 's only that since you 're not really different than the rest of us , I ca n't stand that lard of your being so superior to everyone . " " I do n't think I 'm so goddam superior . . . " " Well then tell me what the hell is wrong about Collier being so healthy and physical ? Take a look at your middle . I mean I do n't say anything about it , but sometimes when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang down like , in puckers and flab and rolls , and I do n't stop and say I find you disagreeable physically . Because you 're the way men are in the cities and offices . What 's wrong with Collier 's health ? I like looking at him , and to tell you the truth , I liked it when he put his hand on me . " " When did he do that ? " I said quickly . I had n't seen him do that . " Every time you were n't looking . " " What the hell did you let him do that for ? " " Because I wanted to see what it was like . And he kissed me , too . " " When ? " " When you went to the bathroom that time , he came over and he kissed me . " " And you let him ? " " Yes . " " Why did n't you tell me ? " 47 " Because I did n't want to ! Am I supposed to ? I knew you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me or God knows what , and he would probably have had to beat your brains out . Besides all it was to me was . . . " She seemed to hesitate . " What ? " " No , I 'll tell you the truth , it was rather nice . " " Did he put his tongue in your mouth ? " " No , he knows his moves . " " What moves ? " " You know what moves . He just put his two lips on mine . He was very gentle , he just touched the tip of my tongue with the tip of his tongue . " " What moves you talking about ? " That girl had certain ways of talking that were right out of the gutter . " You know what moves , " she said , " the right moves at the right time . " " And what does that mean ? " " You know what that means . It means he 's been around , been there and back , and knows how to set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much early foot , you prig , by which I mean he knows better than to come on too fast , but to judge the company he 's in and what the traffic will bear , you prig , and not get stirred up faster than he was stirring me up , which he was right then , damn right well was , straight up , you prig , you know what moves , so why act so superior , and do n't make me tell them unless you 're looking to get hurt . Because I 'd just as soon , you liar . You talked one story to me when I was packing to get on the Midnight that night and another story since ; no mention of all you said to me that night ! No mention since . Silence ! O.K. I 'll take it that way . Because you 're the best I 've got right now . But do n't put me on trial . Who the hell do you think I am ? Your wife ? I have n't given you the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , so what ? At least he did n't hand me a lot of those I love you lies . If you want to know the truth , I would n't at all mind trying him out . I do n't have any obligation to you . Where are we , in the last century ? I just might ; you keep that up and I just might ! " I had left . It was either leaving or murdering her. 48I could n't figure out what got into her so suddenly . It started out to be a perfectly normal discussion . I guess , like me , she 'd stored up resentment and anger and pretended everything was all right till BOOM ! Well , after dinner that night , Florence and I were sitting around watching one of those CBS White Papers when Irene , the maid , came in and told me that there was someone from the office on the telephone . I got up and went towards the phone . Then I suddenly stopped . I figured it was Gwen . I sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her to say I 'd be right there . Then I went to the bar and poured myself a Dewars just to gain time . I said to myself : stop . Think . A woman who resents you and despises you that much , who needs that . I took half my Dewars . There was another consideration , not a very noble one , but I have to admit it crossed my mind . My allowance on the magazine 's budget for a research assistant had given out a week ago . If Gwen was to be paid this week , and from this week on , it would have to come out of my pocket . I had a hunch if I told her this , and stopped paying her , she 'd pull up and go back to New York . In other words . . . in other words . . . In other words what the hell did that have to do with it ? I finished my drink . I hated her one way . I was out of my head crazy about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much . Nor had I ever resented anyone as much . Nor , I thought , been so bewildered . I certainly could n't take any more of that scorn . I went to the phone . Gwen sounded soft and subdued . Oh my God ! She said she was sorry . She sounded as if she had been drinking . I did n't say anything , punishing her . She said , " Eddie . . . Eddie . . . are you there ? " " Yes , " I said . " You 're all I have , Eddie . " Out of the blue . " How come ? " I said . " Because nobody else can stand me , daddy . " Then she said , " I can understand where you would n't want to have anything more to do with me . " I did n't say anything. 49 " Well I was thinking maybe it would be an idea if I divided myself in two , you know , like if I was your assistant , like your secretary part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and researching what you tell me to research . No comments , no discussions , no judgments . Just like I was working for another man . Then there 'd be our time together . Do you think something like that would work , Eddie ? " I said nothing . " Eddie , are you still there ? You 're all I have , Eddie . " " I doubt that . " " That stuff I said , will you forget it ? I know you ca n't say anythingnow because you 're home . And I 'll get the hell off the phone . Shall I come over when you said tomorrow , Eddie ? " " Yes , " I said . And hung up . I had never heard her that way . I did n't know she had it in her . When I came into the other room , Florence looked up . " I wish the office would n't bother you at night , " she said. 50  --  3  --  T HEY say you ca n't compartmen- talize life . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Florence began to notice something . One night we were expecting the Soloffs for after-dinner bridge . We were just getting through our food . The record player was on the last of the stack we put on for each meal . Florence kept clearing her throat all through the brown betty , so I knew she had some- thing to say to me . But I was n't in any hurry to hear . I 'd been to the beach with Gwen that afternoon , and I needed a nap , if only for ten minutes , before the game started . I 'm a miserable bridge player at my very best ; my mind wanders . Florence is damned good . That 's why I occasionally used to play . It gave her a chance to be damned good . But that night she had something to say to me before the Soloffs arrived . Over the Drambuie and the mints it finally came out . " Sugar , " she said , " you 've begun to talk to yourself . " " I 've always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all do . But I do n't think you realize how bad it 's gotten . " " Oh , Florence , let me live , will you ? " I was rather relieved this was all she had on her mind . " Did you know your lips keep twitching ? " I was spending my days in violent debate with myself , but I did n't know it showed . " Ellen 's noticed it , too , " she added . " Nothing un- usual has happened at the office , has it ? " " No , I do n't think so . " 51 " Well , something 's got you for sure . Did Dr. Massey say anything to you ? " " About what ? " Massey was our dentist . " I went in for my checkup today , and he told me he had seen further evidence in your mouth that you 'd been grinding your teeth . Did n't he say anything about that the last time you saw him ? " " Maybe . Now that you remind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The age of disbelief and all . But I thought our life was so remarkably free of tensions that  --  " " It is , it is , " I interrupted hastily . " Evans , " she said in her calm voice , " I did n't finish my sentence . " " Well , I know what you were going to say . " That crack always made her furious . " Do n't you see how presumptuous that is , dear ? " she said , being very patient . " I think the Soloffs are driving in , " I said . " Evans , it 's eight-twenty , and the Soloffs are not due till eightthirty , so you ca n't get out of it that way . " Ten minutes is a long time , I thought . " Florence , how would you like another  --  " " You are constantly cutting me off in the middle of a sentence , " she said , cutting me off in the middle of a sentence . " I do n't mind when we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Soloffs who notice everything and are terrible gossips . . . " " What the hell do we have them here for , if they 're such terrible gossips ? " " Because they play excellent bridge , and you just did it again . " " What ? " " Cut me off in the middle of a sentence . And it goes on all night . " " You mean when I sleep I cut  --  " " Your teeth grind , and you talk to yourself . Sort of a civil war you 're fighting , Dr. Leibman said it was . The other night , you said in your sleep , I hate her . ' You do n't hate me , do you , Evans ? " " Of course not . " " Well then , who is it you do hate ? " " How should I know ? " " Who should know if you do n't ? " " The Japanese sandman. " 52 " Last night , you lay there for hours , just staring at the ceiling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Thinking . Anything wrong with that ? " " Of course not , but sometimes , honestly , I can actually hear you grinding your teeth , " she laughed . " And once you sort of pounded your fist . That was the time I jumped clear out of bed . " This seemed to amuse her no end . " Florence , I 'm not doing it on purpose . " " But why all of a sudden do you grind your teeth , have nightmares , and talk to yourself all day long ? " " Florence , what 's all this leading up to ? " " You know what it 's leading up to . I do wish you would , Evans . Ev ! " " I ca n't stand Dr. Leibman . " " Just try it for a while . Dr. Leibman could help you , Ev . " " Fuck Dr. Leibman . " " I have no intention of doing that . Ev ! Really , dear , really . Oh damn , here are the Soloffs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her last-minute checkup . " Anyway , I do wish you 'd try to control your lips tonight . The Soloffs might think you 're sending me signals . " She laughed . She had the laugh of a little girl , a darling laugh . " I mean , if you must talk to yourself all through the bridge game , that 's your privilege , I suppose . . . " " You 're goddam right that 's my privilege . And furthermore , it 's the only way I can get through an evening with the Souffle . " That was my pet name for Mrs. Soloff , a large , puffy woman . That made Florence laugh . " Shhh ! " she said . " There 's the bell . Just try not to let it show quite so much . And some day , monster , do tell me what 's going on . And whom you hate . I must say I prefer that to your loving someone . Just so long as it is n't me . Are you sure it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then come on , " she said , indicating a place on her cheek . I kissed where she pointed . In came the Soloffs and caught us in the act . " Ah , we interrupt , " said the Souffle . Mr. Soloff never spoke except to bid . He was a libel lawyer for a large motion picture com-53pany , a very cautious man . The Souffle , though , did all the talking necessary for both . " Yes , " said Florence , " you certainly do interrupt . " Then she sort of kissed them both , and we sat down to those five long rubbers . The Soloffs won the first . We went down some eight hundred points . I played miserably , worse than usual . But I did control my lip movements . We stopped for a moment and stretched . The Souffle had to take a leak , and Mr. Soloff used the phone quickly . Florence had a chance to whisper to me , " Sugar , if you 're going to play that badly , maybe you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first hand , second rubber . I jumped to six . Florence almost went the whole hog , but , because of a general distrustof my bridge , did n't . By the rules , she should have . I certainly had the strength . " Thank you very much , partner , " she said when I laid down . I did the ritual of crossing behind her and looking at her cards , and said , " Very nice , partner , " which relieved me of further responsibility for that hand . Then I ran upstairs and dialed Gwen 's number . She was not at home . Or was n't answering . I went downstairs and to the bar . " Where the hell is that bitch ? " I asked myself . Then I said to myself , " You 're talking to yourself . " Then I said to myself , " The hell with it  --  I 'm going to talk to myself all night tonight . I 'll choke to death if I do n't talk to myself . Everything I say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dummy get anyone a drink ? No ? " ) Well , I 'm going to have one ! Better make it a single , though , Eddie . There . That helps . Why the hell did Massey mention about my teeth grinding to Florence ? Where 's his professional discretion ? Everyone 's teeth grind today . ( " Grand slam ! Very good , partner . Oh , sorry . Mr. Soo , of course , you 're absolutely right , bid six , one over . Right . " ) Your mother too ! But you know , Evans , Eddie , Evangelos , whateveryour name is , it 's true what she said . You are losing control of yourself . Like this afternoon ? Hell , that was n't my doing ; that was Gwen 's idea . The girl controls things like that . But to do it on the beach , in the middle of the afternoon ! What have I got , some kind54of compulsion to break the law ? Or do I want to get caught ? Williamsand MacElroy Vice-President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love that ! Well , it was n't quite that bad . The nearest people were fifty feet away . At least . Anyway , it was her fault . She covered our bottom halves with a towel . Go tell that to the judge . Your honor , our bottom halves were covered completely with a Chorpenning towel , deluxe grade ; we handle their account . Why do I keep imagining myself arrested ? And on trial ? And besides , the nearest people were a good seventy-five feet away , lying on their backs , faces turned up to the sun , and their eyes absolutely closed . No doubt thinking how much they 'd give to be young again . Not that I am . But she makes me feel young . Like a wild kid she is , and like a wild kid she makes me feel . ( " Oh , sorry . I bid . . . I bid . . . I 'll say one No . " ) I 've really got three , but if I say three , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably bid another suit and be so grateful for my support she wo n't notice me going upstairs again . So she says do n't get sand up . But those were her last words . Only gasps from then on , oh my God , with the sun and the sea and the breeze and her face shining and her hair flying . . . ( " Well , partner , no , I think I 'm going to let you play it . Three hearts ? I 'll say four . " ) How can you blame me , how can you ever blame me with that silky hair blowing , and her nose just a little red from the sun , and her eyes wild with breaking the moral law , and she herself breaking to bits there under me . ( " Why , you 're welcome , partner . I thought you 'd like them apples . " ) Dear silly-dilly Florence .

" ) 55Someday I 'm going to come out with Souffle , and that , chum , will be the end of these particular games . But there 's always another card lover waiting in the woodwork . I never used to puff running up these stairs . The strange thing is that ever since the day she told me off , I 've wanted her only more . Has anyone yet studied the connection between hatred and sex ? Well , I wish somebody would and let me know how it turns out . Now she better be in . She told me to phone her later . No answer . Goddam her , where is she ? The movies , no doubt , I hope . Stop worrying about it . Better get downstairs . That 's what I like , when she loses control , when she 's helpless , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass pumping , and those fragrant terminal quivers . I thought she 'd never stop . I tell you it 's holy . Not to be questioned . . . . And when she let out with that moaning , that song of love , right there on the beach . What ? No one could hear that ! With the sound of the surf and all ! But really , what am I trying to do , get arrested ? And faint , did she faint after ? She lay there like she was faint . Ohh , I 'm sure enough out of control . Like at that party the other night . Insanity ! ( " Good work , partner ! " " Was n't that beautifully played , Mrs. Soof ? " ) Well , say so , you bitch ! But really , Eddie , you better be careful ! Meet me upstairs in the bathroom in five minutes ! For chrissake ! And that was your idea . Then on the tile floor yet . With Florence downstairstalking about moral rearmament . I 've forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean something is out of control somewhere . No wonder you 're grinding your teeth . ( " Well , I know I gave you good support , but as Mrs. Soof says , you did play it astutely . " ) Mrs. Souffle and her ass-tutely  --  that would be a sight to behold ! Hell , it 's my deal . Well , I 'm going to say Bye no matter what I have . And where does she get off with that prejudice shit ? ( " Ooops ! Misdeal  --  sorry , all ! Cards getting sticky , I guess . " ) 56I may lie everywhere else , but not when I write a serious piece for a serious journal . Eddie lies , but not Evans . Name me one person who 's done more to expose fraud in public life . Well , I can . But not many . Or done it as well . I write exquisite literary murder . ( " I bye . Sorry , partner . " ) And I 'm not like these people here . No ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time for ? Not all the time , twice a month . Can I help it if Florence . . . ? Fuck Florence . You fuck Florence . ( " Sorry . Ca n't help you partner . Bye .

Maybe I 'll just take her off salary . Who 's kidding ? I 'm paying that bitch out of my own pocket  --  and for what ? To insult me ? So I 'll just stop shelling out one of these days , and she 'll get the message . When the shoe pinches , throw the shoe away . ( " Sorry , Mrs. Soof . I did n't realize you could see my cards . " ) Gwen 's nothing anyway . What did she ever accomplish ? Nothing . That 's why she has to put down anything anyone else accomplishes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the critics . Eunuchs in a harem .

That bitch . I wonder where she is tonight . I am crazy about her . Gone . Out of control . Yeh , yeh ! Well , enjoy it as long as you can , and then one day walk away . That 'll teach her who to attack . I 'm a bourgeois slob am I ? Well , screw you , Sister Kate . Will the real Miss Gwendolyn Hunt stand up and answer this question ?

Boff ! Where does she come off criticizing me ? ( " Well , I 'm sorry Mrs. Soloff . I 'm certainly not conveying signals to Florence with my lips . That 's just my nervous tic . Have n't you noticed how I keep jumping up and down to go to the bathroom ? I 'm really awfully sorry , but you 've got this all wrong . Really . No , it 's nothing serious , but ... no need to apologize . Thank you . " ) Jesus ! Am I going to hear about this from Florence ! That 's the way the game went . Finally , about eleven-fifteen , when I was dummy again , I got Gwen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all . Of course , that 's when they 're not . But she really did sound loving . And she told me where she had gone ( a New Wave movie ) and with whom ( a faggoty hairdresser who tells her all the movie star gossip ) . And it all sounded plausible , if maybe a little too sincere . You just never know . So I told her to come over tomorrow ; I had some work for her to do . And she said o.k. , she would , goodnight darling , I love you . I told her I loved her too . We beat the Soloffs out of some twenty dollars . Florence said , just before she put out the lights , that we were really a pretty good team , and that I could be real good if I 'd only concentrate . Again my mind had been somewhere else all evening , she said , but except for that one incident , I had controlled my lips better . Exhausted by the exhilaration of the contest , Florence slept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henderson . Pat , the office joke , had n't been able to bring himself to break off from his wife . His girl friend worked in the art department , and everyone had advised her to forget about Pat , give him up . Then one day when Pat was in New York for a big client confrontation , he sat down in his room at the Commodore and wrote them both letters. 58And he put each letter in the other envelope . That was Pat 's hand from outer space . I was thinking of Pat when I fell asleep . Next thing I knew I was the man in charge of the dike which was holding back the flood . A huge pile-up , it was , of whatever I could rush to meet the mounting tide of water  --  planks , old doors , dining room tables and other furniture , some of it oddly familiar , along with all the debris of the deluge  --  uprooted trees , and the bloated bodies , intertwined , of domestic animals and of people , some of whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't help them ; I was in too much danger myself ) , and whole houses , askelter , among them the one I used to live in as a kid  --  the whole piled-up structure rickety , to the point where it rose and fell with the heaving weight of water which it could n't hold back any longer . I could see the waters bursting through here and there , and I 'd run to stop a break , barely holding off the imminent collapse , when farther along I 'd see another gushing to which I 'd have to turn , whispering all kinds of false good news as I ran ( " Stop talking to yourself ! " ) and there frantically thrust not my Dutchboy finger , but my whole body 's bulk into the rupture , again just managing to hold off the catastrophe , though not for long because there was too much water coming through all up and down the line , and I had nothing left to stop the breaks and did n't know whether to go this way or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was all going down , down , and down , and I was standing there beaten , in tears , the sounds of disaster on every side of me , and I knew that something more important than my life had been at stake , although I could n't say in the dream what that was , except that when the dam collapsed , everything did , all hope with it , and I just did manage to throttle the sound that would have vented my shame , a sound that Florence certainly would have heard . I was awake . I wanted to wake Florence , to tell her everything . Because I could n't contain the situation any more . I just did catch myself . I had to get up out of bed and walk myself over to the far corner of the room and sit in the chair there . My hand had actually been on her shoulder to shake her . The sight of her face in the immaculate pink of sleep , so trusting and so peaceful , had aroused something that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was and what I was doing . My whole chicken life had been59lived in a terrible straddle , never wholeheartedly for anything , not really with Florence , never really with anyone else . Again I was close to waking Florence . I had to hold myself down in that chair . There was something in me I could barely control , something trying to tear down the whole arrangement by which I lived my life . And I was n't going to let it , goddam if I was ! My body was covered with perspiration , but I was n't ready for that yet . It was still on me , that impulse , like a dog at my throat , and I was breathing as if I 'd just run a mile . I must have fallen into a kind of sleep again , though there was no boundary of consciousness that I remember crossing . I heard voices like the cries from the streets of revolution . I was huddled in a hotel room , now , the door barricaded with whatever was in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debris  --  and I was waiting alone in the room for the terrible thing to happen , with no way to prevent it . I knew the palace guard had been killed , becausethe massed voices were coming down the avenue closer and closer , now almost on me . Again I knew that what was at stake was nothing as trivial as this girl or that ; it was something about my whole goddam existence , something like the hopes that I had once had for myself , or the thing honor , the thing that 's always threatened  --  honor or my dying self-respect , one of those words you never use now because it seems irrelevant to the way we live our days . Then , heard apart from the clamors of disruption being flung aloft like banners from the burning streets , there was one voice that was closer . Although I recognized it as that of my chief antagonist , it was also the friendliest voice of all . It spoke softly in mournful warning , giving me the news I dreaded , that the compartments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what was coming was now hard on me . I could see the tides had reached where I was ; the water was flooding under the door and beginning to fill the room . I was soaking wet , cold and trembling , and Florence was shaking me , trying to wake me , saying , " What are you doing over here , you silly thing , come back to bed , baby . Oh , Ev , dear , I wish you would just see him a few times ; he could really help you , he really could , but never mind now , just come back to bed , you 're so wet . " And she led me back to where I slept the rest of the night without dreams . When I woke next morning , Florence had already left the house. 60I had my breakfast alone . I read the sports page . I drove to the office . There was nothing in the mail . I was my usual cheery , aggressiveself . By noon I was back home . Gwen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final draft of the Collier piece . I was getting angry at Gwen . I suspectedshe was subtly influencing me to go easier on Collier than I was disposed to . I asked her , in the most matter of fact tone , never lifting my eyes off the page I was working over , did she like the piece . Which was n't a friendly act , because I knew I was forcing her to say something I would n't like . She answered just as impersonally and just as coolly , " No , I do n't agree with anything in it . " We continued working in silence for a bit . We were both self-trained not to show reactions . But my face was burning . And when she looked at me , I could see she was frightened . She went to the door , closed it , came to me and kissed me , and said , " But I do love you . " What happened next I do n't understand , except that you certainly ca n't call it love ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went for her , right there in my own study . It was an insane thing to do , because everyone was in the house  --  Ellen , the two servants , and the man fixing the TV aerial  --  everyone except Florence . But even if she had been in , it would n't have made any difference . And in the middle of it all I thought , am I trying to be found out , do I want to be discovered ? Like my friend Pat , who wrote the right letter and put it in the wrong envelope ? But all through , I did n't say a word or make a sound . I clasped her blindly , as if our intercoursewas the one thing in the world I was sure of . It happened that Gwen left her marks on my back , not at the shoulders , where she held me with cupped hands , but down at the sides , at my waist , towards the back , where she had held on like death with her nails . There were traces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were both perspiring . Gwen quickly composed herself and resumed typing . But I was too bewildered by what had happened . I grabbed a robe , walked out of the room , out through the house and to the pool , and fell in . I soaked there for a while , the warm water relaxing me . Then I crawled up the side and fell asleep on my face just where I landed . That is where Florence found me . She came up and saw me and61saw  --  or did n't see  --  the marks on my back . Barely disturbing my sleep , she went into the house , up the stairs and came on Gwen sitting at the typewriter in my study , using an emery board . Gwen was not aware , for a moment , that Florence was in the doorway , watching as she tested the filed-down nails on her upper arm . Not satisfied , she resumed filing , and it was then , she told me later , that she became aware of Florence . They exchanged pleasantries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time I woke and went in for my Gibson , Gwen had left . Florence asked me , in a very offhand way , if I would indulge her in a prejudice . She said Gwen looked like a tramp to her , and she would rather appreciate it if she could do my work at the office . I played it equally offhand and said sure . Then she asked , " She 's not working for you much longer , is she ? " I said , " She 's only on the Chet Collier piece . " And I wondered how much Florence knew and what she was thinking . Because if she had seen the marks on my back and put them together with the evidence of the emery board , she should have made a hell of a row . So I took no chances . I told her that , quite seriously , Gwen was not much of a researcher , and I was glad to say she would be through this coming weekend . Furthermore , if Florence did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it that she was n't ever again . Florence seemed satisfied . Since it was only a few days more , she said , it did n't really matter . I asked Florence to make me one of those superior Gibsons of hers , figuring if she did , it would be an absolutely reliable good sign . She made me a beauty . I 'd squeaked through again . It was obvious that my days with Gwen were numbered . But I wanted every minute of what time was left . So I was extremely careful . When we got to the beach , I took her much farther out , first to the stretch of sand north of Malibu , and then as far as Zuma , and finally above that to the Ventura coast . All the dangers she and I were running , and particularly the recognition that our days together would soon be over , made us closer , even more in love . At the end of one long afternoon , a perfect afternoon when the sea was a lake , not the grumpy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kelp and refuse  --  we were out there in the still water up to our waists , standing there , just holding hands , and Gwen looked at me with such love , and with such sad-62ness , and she said , " Eddie , what 's going to happen to us ? " The water kept moving around us , moving and washing and stirring to remind us that nothing stands still , and nothing human endures , and that our lives are nothing , and that even the sea , in its own history , was not there once , and it too would in time be gone . And I said to her , " Gwen , I need you . " And she looked at me so sweetly and said , " I know you do . " She smiled at me , and I at her , and we both knew that I had n't answered her question . A person does n't pay recognition to his immortal moments at the time they 're happening . But we did that afternoon without knowing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the time it seemed mostly like a lot of horsing around . I had my Nikon with me , and I put it up on a rock , focused it on her , set the timing device , and than ran around and got into the picture with her . Those first pictures do n't look like much , mostly just friends , no real hint of what was going on between us . But towards the end of the roll we did what I imagine many lovers have done when silly-happy . We wanted to immortalize ourselves . I do n't know if it was she or I who said something ; more likely we did n't need to , either of us . It was spontaneous for us to take off our bathing suits and pose that way together . Each time , I 'd run around to make sure of the focus and the exposure and then run back and stand in with her . So we celebrated ourselves , that moment in time , that condition of feeling . Like a nation might issue a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then we did a few funny ones  --  at least we thought they were funny  --  my ogling her tits , things like that . She was awfully proud of her tits in those days . I do n't think she feels that way now . Tits are temporary , like flowers ; they change . I ca n't remember anyone except Gwen , and Gwen just at that time , who was perfectly proud of her tits . Everyone else I 've ever known has thought something wrong . Too " A , " too " D , " too chesty , too pendulous , too wall-eyed , too cross-eyed , too much nipple , too cherry , alwayssomething . I mean the human ego ! Anyway , that afternoon we were in our glory , like two animals in an animal conspiracy against mankind . It never got any better between us after that day . We had a tough time getting the films developed and printed . She finally got them done by a " member of the sorority , " she said . I guess she meant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional photographer . You could tell because the final prints turned out so beautifully . Gwen would n't tell me her name . But she sure was good . I asked Gwen what she had thought of me , and she said , " She thought you were o.k . But she thought I looked wonderful . " All the girls were envious of Gwen 's figure in those days . That 's what gave her that bounce when she walked . Gwen did n't need an analyst to build her self-esteem . All she needed was a mirror . Anyway this carrying-on sorority sister bound up a set handsomelyfor each of us because , as she said to Gwen , a perfect momentis also a work of art . I kept my set in a drawer , the one that locked , the one where I kept my five hundred dollars get-away money . I guess everyone has such a drawer , one that locks . Everyoneexcept Florence . It was against her code of honor to have secrets in a marriage , so she did n't need a drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to have such a drawer . I am a student of my past . Nothing fascinates me as much as the course of my own life . I still have the photograph of the first girl I kissed , the first ad I wrote , and the speech I made at my graduation from the Albert " Zooboo " Leonard Junior High School , the speech called , " Columbus , the First American ! " I have , by the ton , photographs , love letters , notes of assignationsacred and profane  --  all manner of shameful mementos that would have been an embarrassment and a shock to Florence . I kept these locked . Because the very essence of our arrangement was discretion . Do n't hurt feelings , and do n't upset the home . That above all ! Up until this business , I had handled it all very well . I had kept my whole rebel life locked safely away in that drawer . And I had the psychic equivalent , a compartment in my feelings which I could also lock the moment I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motto : " Indifference Saves ! " That 's the secret as I saw it then , final indifference . The first sign of my slipping was when I fired my harem . It meant that I was n't indifferent about Gwen . That should have warned me . The next sign was when I went home and cleaned everything that did n't pertain to Gwen out of that drawer . I did n't throw anything away , of course ; I tied it all in one big bundle , sealed it , glued it , scotch-taped it , and waxed where the strings crossed . And then I put it in the big metal closet behind Mr. Finne-64gap 's office where I had the other private papers that I did n't want to keep around the house . So the day I forgot to lock the drawer , the day that our maid . Irene , opened it , all she found was a few notes from Gwen , which gave away very little , and this beautifully printed and beautifully bound collection of beach art , which gave away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog that morning . ( When I was this way in my high school days , my father used to look at me and say " Hey , Shakespeare ! Wake up ! " Then he 'd laugh , shake his head , and look around for a witness to his trouble , and if he found one , he 'd point at me and say , " Hopeh-less Case ! " ) From the moment I woke that morning I did n't know what I was supposed to be or do , where to go , what to try , and why pretend . I got up and no one else was up , so I wandered around , made coffee  --  it tasted bitter  --  walked around the yard , thought I 'd cut the grass , thought I would n't , felt I was waiting for something , did n't know what , opened the Los Angeles Times , shut it , then just gave up . I sat myself downstairs in our formal parlor , a very dark room , very expensively furnished , sat there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me for about an hour . Everything seemed tasteless and unreal , without " tam " as the Jews say , not worth getting up and moving for . Finally , in an effort to revive some sort of appetite , I went upstairs and looked at the official photographs . They made me feel better . So I thought I 'd take a shower , and then look at them again . I put the picturescarefully in the drawer but did n't lock it since I was going to be looking at them again in a few minutes . Then I entered the stall and ran the hot water over me for about ten minutes , just standing there with my head bowed . Why do those photographs make me feel better , I wondered . Maybe because at least that is real for me . I may not be what I dreamed I 'd be when I was a kid , but at least in that respect I exist . There 's the evidence . I got out of the shower , and was singing , and Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh and pretty , so goddam hopeful without hoping for anything in particular , just because it was that time of her life , that I decided to have breakfast with her . Which I did . Then we walked the flower paths back of the house . When we came to the pool , it looked like you could drink it , so I stripped to my shorts , she to her bra and panties , and we jumped in . That made me feel wonderful . So before I knew it , I was on my way to see Gwen , which I did often on my way to work , 65just to start the day right . After which I decided to take the face to Jerry the barber , and let him spoil it with attention and lotions . And as I sat in Jerry 's big chair and felt the first hot towel hit me , I thought , my God , I forgot to lock that drawer . Irene , the maid , must have had quite a moral struggle . She was a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptist Church . Part of the deal with Irene was that somebody had to take her to that Church , way down on Central Avenue , and bring her back every Sunday morning , or else she would n't work Sundays . She had high ethical standards . But the most trying kind of moral dilemma is that between two moralities , in this case between honor ( it was obviously a private drawer even if it was n't locked right then ; Irene had no business even opening it ) and loyalty to her sex , with that number one corollary : keeping husbands on the straight and narrow . Irene must have hesitated about it quite a bit . I did n't know till later what made her decide to give the photographs to Florence . But she did . She was finally convinced it was the right thing to do . I 've had a lot of trouble all of my life with people who were doing the right thing . But Irene did n't know Florence . And mind you , Florence liked the woman . Irene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maids were , and still must be , hard to find . And Irene was doing right , was on her side , solidly for the home and militantly against husbands who strayed ( as her own had , permanently ) . None of this made a difference . Florence fired her that morning . Told her to pack up and get out , and sent her away in a taxi within the hour . Florence would n't have a maid in the house who pried . After Irene had gone , Florence was left there with the pictures . I guess she must have looked at them hard and long . I rushed home at lunch on some pretext I cooked up . Florence met me at the door , told me that Irene had gone , and why . Then she looked at me . I knew I could n't get out of this one . Florence was around the house for a while . I did n't chase her down , because I could n't think of a damned thing to say . In those photographs , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and mine . You know that absolutely hostile look a cat gets when it 's doing it to another cat ? I mean some of those photographs were n't playful . And Florence had to think , just had to : how long since he looked at me that way ? And she must have looked at my cock too , had to . In one of those photographs , Gwen was holding it . Now what66the hell did I take that picture for ? I must have been out of my loving mind . I heard Florence 's car drive away . Dr. Leibman , o.k. , I figured . I felt sort of sick , and a little afraid . So then started an afternoon of what they call agonizing reappraisal . But while I spent those hours doing all that spiritual selfexamination , Florence was much more practical . She did n't bother with Dr. Leibman . Not till later . She went straight down to see her lawyer , Arthur Houghton . ( Actually , Arthur was our lawyer . But when it came to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse . ) They had a " preliminary discussion . " Arthur told her reassuring news about some interesting precedents for divorce settlements . In the light of that discussion , immensely comforting to Florence , it becameevident to her that she held a hell of a whip , and that by the time she was done with me , all I 'd have left in the way of material possessions would be those same photographs of Gwen and myself , and those only because she did n't want them . Florence 's father is the retired president of a New England college ( the one I went to ) and the senior member of a large WASP law firm which includes Arthur Houghton . Florence said later , in a burst of good humor and over-all confidence , that she had always resented the members of that WASP law firm for looking so much like each other and so little like roe . But in the present circumstances , she suddenly found she even liked the way they looked . Anyway , she sure found out she was protected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling change in her attitude next time I saw her . I did n't go back to the office that afternoon . I did n't call Gwen to tell her the news either . I just sat by the side of the pool and said to myself that perhaps the moment 1 'd been waiting for all these months was now here . Of course ! No Italian , no Spaniard , certainly no Frenchman would give up his home , his life 's savings , and his wife for a piece of tail . And no Greek , ancient or modern , would discommodehimself in the least for any such trifle , no matter how succulent . The Greek would simply accept the fact that a man had to give up a lot of things in life to hold on to the main thing . Then I fell asleep . I was enjoying my nap by the pool and no dreams , when I became aware of Florence standing over me . I purposely stayed half asleep , because I was n't ready for a confrontation . But she had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was my favorite , a bony67Gibson . She put it down on the little table next to the pool-side recliner . And she said softly , " Dinner will be in half an hour , darling , and I think the new maid 's cooking is going to be just wonderful ! " Then she walked away . What the hell was going on ? I 'd expected her to be carrying a baseball bat , not a Gibson . Would Gwen have done that ? Never . So I went to the house and made me another  --  a beaut , double stiff . Then I thought , since this may be my last dinner in this house , I 'll get real dressed up . I went upstairs to the bedroom . There I saw the development . We had a large sofa against the foot of the bed . Florence had fixed it to sleep on . She was just coming out when I came in , and I said in the tone of a child 's protest , " Am I supposed to sleep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling . I 'm sleeping there . " Whatever had happened between her and Arthur Houghton and during her later visit to Dr. Leibman , the result was tonic . The meal that night turned into a kind of celebration . We did fall into luck with the new cook . Florence had been clever enough to tell her to make her own favorite dishes . Well , this cook , another portly Negro matron , had just spent twenty years with a Jewish family . What she prepared that night was sauerbraten , potatopancakes , red cabbage , and applesauce . Oh my ! With it we had a Burgundy which Florence selected and 1 opened and poured tenderly . Candles were lit . And the hi-fi played Strauss . Ellen , who ate with us , must have known there was a crisis . But 1 think what gave her that puzzled look was how it was being played out . For Florence had class . She carried it off as if life has its ups and downs , and the downs have to be combated , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as pleasant as possible during this painful period . I could n't make out what Ellen thought , or felt . Her date arrived right in the middle of dessert , and Ellen , when she saw him , seemed very relieved . She came over to me , kissed me good night , and then looked at me rather strangely , as if she wanted to say something but could n't just then . She ran out without kissing Florence . In the spirit of the evening , I tried to cover this . " I think she 's having some kind of trouble with her boy friend , " I said . But Florence had n't noticed . She had eyes only for our trouble . If nature and society ever turned out a woman without conniv-68ante , contrivance , or any psychological curves  --  a troubled woman , yes , but straight and true no matter how troubled  --  that woman was Florence . The only way you can finally judge a person is how they behave under stress , especially when they 're hurt . That night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had suffered that morning , and the terrible knots of pain still in her stomach , Florence showed her class . We were sitting in the parlor having Drambuie and green mints . She had lit my cigar , thin and long , and she was blowing her uninhaledcigarette smoke up to the ceiling , and there was silence for a while . Then quite deliberately she took my hand , and smiled at me with the simplest friendship . I suddenly felt much love for her . It seemed that her first impulse was to be understanding of my pain . And to give me time to collect myself . What she said was , " Why do n't you go to bed now , darling , and get a good night 's sleep ? You must be exhausted . And I think you 'll sleep much better tonight . I do n't think you 'll grind your teeth tonight , or talk to yourself , because now there 's nothing to hide , is there ? Go on . We 'll talk tomorrow maybe , or maybe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided to do just that . I was damned grateful for her concernand for her generosity . As I went up the stairs I thought : you still have n't called Gwen , you have n't talked to her since morning , and if you wait till tomorrow before you talk to her , well you know that bitch , it 's just possible she wo n't be there by then . All she needed was the slightest hiatus , and all the outrageous and unfair and humiliating things about our arrangement would come home to her . She would be on the next plane east . The hell with it , I thought . This is my life at stake . I 'm not going to be rushed . I 'm going to go my own way , in my own time , and let everyone else go their own way in their own time . In fact the first thing I 'm going to do is take a bath . I had a shower before dinner , and now I 'm going to take a long , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid out a fresh pair of pajamas . I really took my time . When I finally came out , there was Florence sitting in the chaise longue , smoking a cigarette , uninhaled , and watching CBS Reports on our bedroom television . As soon as I came in , however , she pressed the remote control button and killed the program . And we were alone . Completely . Then she spoke , ever so gently . " Quite frankly , darling , my im-69pulse when I first saw you was to simply bash you one . I could havekilled you . But it always helps to let just a little time pass and talk f to a few people you trust . . . " She went on to tell me about what Arthur Houghton had said , and what Dr. Leibman had said . I heard some of it . But the reason I stopped really listening was that I saw she was treating me like a " sick " person , handling me gingerly , the way you do someone who 's off his rocker or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every step . She was right ! I had been behavinglike an insane person . When I tuned her back in , she was saying , " So I thought , it hurts , it hurts like hell , but it 's Evans who has the problem , not me . And then so much was suddenly clearer to me , all your talking to yourself , and your poor old teeth grinding , oh dear ! And I felt so sorry for you , because you 're obviously not responsiblefor what you do any more , not really . I knew who it was you hated when you said in your sleep , I hate her ! ' That is the one thing that gives me the most hope . It is she , is n't it ? I do n't mean to quiz you " ( she was handling me so gingerly ) ; " I know you hate to be quizzed , but just answer that one question , and I wo n't ask anotherall night long . " I said , " Yes , it was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " " Of course , " said Florence , " so I know something of what 's happeninginside you . There 's your nightcap , darling , right by the bed . I know bow hard it must be to be in bed with your old wife and quite possibly yearning for another woman . I 've often thought that , when I 've watched you lying on your back there " ( I was on the bed by then ) , " looking up at the ceiling , your lips moving . You remember the night you were aroused . I knew it was n't for me . Well . . . I do n't think you should be quizzed and badgered tonight . Or tomorrow , either , or for a while maybe . I know what tremendous pressure you 've been under . And finally , dear , not now , but finally you will have to make a decision . Because it 's very simple is n't it , as simple as her or me ? I know how hard it is for you to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this time . For , after all , I have to make a life , if not with you , then with . . . some other kind of a life . " She took a long drag of her cigarette , looked diagonally up at the ceiling , blew out the smoke she had not inhaled , and said , " Darling , when it first hit me , you know , the photographs and all they implied " ( she was tucking me in ) , " I was very , very angry . Are you comfortable ? Yes . Good ! But I 'm not angry now . " 70She walked away and spoke from the bathroom . " I 'm not angry , because you 've had to bear it all alone , without anyone to help you , and no one to talk to about it . That 's what Dr. Leibman called to my attention when I saw him this afternoon . So you see he 's really not against you . He 's really on your side . I can see now what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sick , ' he said . Oh , I know that word has bad connotations , none of which I mean . Think of it as a gentle word , expressing true concern on the part of your friends . It 's even a loving word  --  just a little sick  --  you see how it can sound ? " She looked out around the edge of the bathroom door . She was undressing now , and smiled and said , " I want to help you . " And then she pulled her head back . She had smiled her simplest , warmest , and most civilized smile . I wondered how could anyone be like that . I mean after having seen those pictures that very morning . She continued from the bathroom : " One of the most damaging and deluding notions people have is that they can carnally love only one person at a time . " She pushed her head around the corner of the bathroom door and she was naked now . The main light was off in the bathroom ; only the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  well , just as she would hope to look . And she went on , " People in our western Christian tradition profess to believe that you truly love only one person carnally at a time . Is it possible that your tradition , the more pagan tradition , is the more honest one ? And that people in our society " ( all this from the bathroom , a faucet running , turned off ) " profess one way , and actually live another way ? " She put her head out for a moment , then a little more , and as she stood there , waiting for my answer , I realized how long it had been since I had seen her naked , that I had rather avoided seeing her naked , perhaps out of some involuted loyalty to Gwen . She smiled at me confidently and disappeared from sight again . Her breasts  --  which I had not looked at for quite a while  --  were larger than Gwen 's . And she was continuing from the bathroom : " For instance , I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite your tradition and different background , you can with me . Oh , you 've tried , but it has n't been the real thing for quite a while , has it ? I mean I 've known you were elsewhere . You 're too honest , darling , to successfully disguise anything as important as that . " Now she came back , dressed in a nightgown , one she knew I liked , no lace on it or any of that peek-a-boo nonsense , nothing71fancy about the hems or trimmings , no please-untie-me straps or ribbons , just a woman in an envelope of beautiful light cloth , not too long , not too tight , walking in my direction . " I must tell you , " she said , " that both Arthur Houghton and Dr. Leibman advised me most strongly , one from the legal point of view and the other from the medical and psychic point of view , that I should definitely not sleep in the same room with you tonight and preferably not in the same house . Nonsense , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still my husband . I said for better or worse ' once , and I meant it . But forgive me " ( she had stopped at the sofa ) " if tonight I simply ca n't come any closer . " She got into the bed she had made for herself on the sofa , and I lay on my back in our bed , and did n't say a word . Then I heard her weeping . Not loud , because Florence is tasteful in everything . But the pain came out as it had to . " Florence , " I said . " Oh , it 's nothing , darling , " she said , " it 's just that I was thinking what to do and I thought : well , I 'll wait for him to make up his mind , to choose , no matter how long it takes . And then I thought , after all , I 'm human , and after a while I may have to have some humanwarmth too . I can see from those photographs , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this tramp  --  excuse me , darling , I did n't mean to say that , but only that I 'll wait as long as I can . I 'll do my best . I will , I promise you that . By the way , how do you get photographs like that developed and printed ? " " She has a darkroom , " I lied . I could n't tell the truth , because Florence would worry about other people having seen the stuff . " Who does ? " " Gwen . " There was a silence , and after a while I could hear her crying softly . I thought how difficult her code of fairness was in these circumstances , and how fine her effort was to live up to her code now . She cried a while , there alone on the sofa , and there was so much longing in the sound , so much hunger . Well , it had to happen . She did n't mean a seduction , I 'm sure . But that woman 's need , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope and expect herself to behave by her code of fairness and civilization and WASP tradition  --  that did get to me. 1 doubt that any man with a heart could lie there and not answer72need as strong and pure as that . Those tears were her hope of life running out . In the middle of it she said , " Evans , Evans , what 's going to happen to us ? " I said , " We 're going to be all right , darling . " And I meant it . Later she said , " Evans , what do you want of me ? " I said , " You , darling , I want you . " All that time I was passionate and aroused . Somebody should study the connection between sex and pity . It was the closest we had been in years . And afterwards , while I was thinking what a mess 1 was ( directly after it was over I had begun to wonder what Gwen was doing ; I had n't called her all day ) , Florence , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there as we used to with her leg over mine and her head on my shoulder , she spoke lovingly : " You see , Evans , I know that finally you 'll come to your senses . What we have together is just too much to give up . You must see that . All this has happened before to millions of couples . " She kissed the side of my face and smiled . " So people have worked out a way to deal with a situation of this kind . That 's what civilization is , darling , these tried and true forms . There is one for this situation we are in . I will continue to be your wife ; I know there is now going to be an interval , but I have faith that it 's going to be temporary . All I have to do is to take one look at those photographs , and I can see that she is an absolute tramp , darling , forgive me . I know that one day you will see , like by a flash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at her . I mean , she 's not in your class , Evans , poor dear Evans , it 's really so silly , all this , but if I do n't see you through this , what will I ever see you through ? Only try to let me know soon , wo n't you ? Soon ? So all right . Let 's say we have an arrangement , all right . I never thought I could , but  --  only , Evans please , Evans . " She fell asleep for an instant , then , " Please , Evans . . Evans . . . what you truly want , see her if that 's what you truly . . . Oh , I do n't know what I 'm saying . Do n't see her is what I mean . Do n't love her . Love me . " I said I did n't want to , that it was all over , that it was completely over . She looked up at me , raising her head off my shoulder , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And she smiled at me . " But it 's nice73to hear , and I hope it 's true . Anyway , it was nice tonight ? Was n't it , Ev ? Like the old days ? " " Yes , " I said , " like the old days ! " She kissed me , smiling a little wickedly , as if now it was she who was stealing someone else 's fellow . And then as happy as I 'd seen her for a long , long time , she fell asleep , smiling like a bride. 744LORENCE had fallen into a fine sleep , but I lay there as if I 'd been hit on the head . I was at the top of a psychic slalom , beginning to go down , but with no way of anticipating how fast and how irreversible the descent would become . I did n't yet know that there are no markers  --  and only very short distances  --  between what is called normal behavior and what is labeled mental illness . I 've since come to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings in various developingconditions , all continuations of what has been there all along unnoticed . That night with Florence was my first experience with the true dilemma of " both . " I 'm not talking about an arrangement , the technique of keeping one woman in place while you temporarily carry on with another . What struck me as I lay and listened to Florence 's even breathing was that both acts , the one with Gwen on my way to work that morning and the one with Florence , while coming hard upon each other , seemed perfectly natural and oddly equal . That shocked me . Not the fact that I had had sexual relations with two women on the same day  --  I had often done that and never felt a qualm . But I had made a genuinely loving connection with two different women , one right after the other , and I was not prepared by my training and tradition to believe that possible . I could n't lie there any longer with Florence 's head on my shoulder and her leg over mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want more talk with Florence right then , so I was very careful not to wake her . She murmured a few times as I disentangled myself . Then she was again safely asleep , and I was out in the hall. 75I wanted to go down and brew myself some coffee , but I heard Bartok . That meant that Ellen and her boy friend Roger were down there with the lights off . So I could n't go down . I wonder how far they went . Bartok was coming to one of his half-assed climaxes . I wondered if they were , too . No . Florence had assured me just a couple of weeks ago that Ellen was intact . Anyway , they were doing something , because I could n't hear their voices . I sat on the steps . I did n't want to go back in the bedroom , and I could n't go downstairs , so I sat there . The human cock , I reflected , is the most honest part of man . I guess the human cunt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . The cock I know more about . The great thing about it , the thing that makes it so completely moral , is that it does n't pretend to any morality . For instance , I thought , the cock would never use the words " ought to . " And never the word " should . " Right there , what a load to lose ! All the Bird knows is " I want . " Or , to be more exact , " Now I want . " None of that forever-and-ever shit . Which has brought more people to early decay than any other sentiment . As well as to destructive acts against their fellow men and women . Most evil is done in the name of good . I WANT ! Come to think of it , that phrase , " I want , " expressed precisely the humanness I had lost . I simply did n't know what I wanted any more . I could n't make a choice ; I was swamped in unresolved boths . I was not doing anything for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure , direct , human , downright babyish " I want "  --  where had that gone ? Long lost . I sat there on the top of those steps and thought , long gone . I 'd lost the knack . I 'd killed the gift . I did n't know what I wanted any more . I felt only that I must do this and should do that , and I was expected to do such and such , and it was my duty to perform this-a-way and my obligation to see this thing through , and it was demanded of me to fulfill  --  always  --  what other people wanted of me . I did n't even know whether I wanted Gwen any more . I had n't called her up , thought I should , had no expectation I would , thought it might be too late if I did , hoped it would , was anxious that it should not be , and so on . The worst of it was a whole other set of imperatives that I had76allowed myself to become subject to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what was useful at a certain time in any situation . " Expedient . " The word written on the tomb of our generation . They did what was expedient . Especially me . But just plain , raw , meat-handed I WANT ? What had happened to that ? Long gone ! Those shoulds . They kill you , those shoulds . Well , to go back to Peter . One-eye Dick is free of shoulds . And oughts . And all the troubles deriving therefrom . The Erect One has one eye on top of his head ; he sights what he wants , takes aim , and charges straight for it . In the spirit of the great Teddy Roosevelt , he calls for all forces to get behind him and charge the hill . And the body , recognizing Tumescent Teddy 's pure want , gets behind him and charges with all it 's got . Here 's another thing I respect about the Joint . You ca n't quite make him get up and pretend . If he does n't want to , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . El Conquistador will lie there and sulk . A soft-on is a reproach to its owner . It says , you 're lying , kid . Later , when the false occasion has passed into history , the Member will sit up and look around , then stand up pretty as a tulip and say , like the comedian , " Wha ' Hoppen ? ? " Not that the Root has to want a lot . But it has to genuinely want some . On the one hand he does n't need , nor does he fall for , that no-one-but-you shit . His point of view on that subject might be expressed thus : Quote . You neurotic son of a bitch , why must you pretend or require that all desire be perfect , complete , and forever ? Or the greatest ? The girls made up that " forever " shit and that " greatest " shit and that " only-you " shit over the centuries to protecttheir fading years . You ca n't blame the girls for that . Their fading is fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say a stiff prick has no conscience , But let 's face it . It 's the honest part of us all , men . And the most democratic . It does n't differentiate between rich and poor , and it draws no color line . Our brothers in our southern states profess to draw the color line everywhere . But Big Peter never went along with that color line , and there are millions of witnesses to that . Old One-eye , like all pure things , tends to be naive . And whereveryou find something pure and naive , you also find someone try-77ing to corrupt it . So the Mindless One is often the unconscious tool ( and victim ) of the corrupt mind and spirit of the person to whom he is attached . Men try to use their better part in so many different ways they should n't . To put girls down , to put other men down , to show off , to bully , to compete , to make up for defeats in other arenas , to revenge themselves , to collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle curiosity . God knows there are hundreds of variations of perversion . Like the very ethical , very famous public figure I know who could do it to his wife only when she was asleep . We take out so many of our sicknesses through our Little Friend . But you ca n't finally corrupt the Shiny-Headed One . He will come back , see something he wants , and just naturally go for it . What could finally be more innocent ? With Florence that night , Peckerstiff was more honest , more gallant , more kind , and more human than I was prepared to be . He felt for Florence , responded to her clear and urgent need . And where my mind was all messed up with conflicts and blocks , the Bird found his nest , did n't pretend he was going to stay there forever , but entered , dispensed his grace , and left to rest . Love and kindness are the finest mixture . Downstairs the music had changed . I figured Ellen 's intellectual boy friend had gone home . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out come my old jazz classics , and out comes Ellen herself . I tiptoed down the stairs . I wanted to make damned sure that Roger had gone . I did n't feel like being patronized and disapproved of right then . I looked from the back of the dining room through the dark pantry and into the brightly lit kitchen . There was Ellen , dancing by herself , bump bump on one side , then bump bump on the other . I was dead certain she was alone , because she had an enormous piece of chocolate cake in her face . And she was enjoying it to beat hell . Neither the watusi nor the chocolate cake are images she presents to Roger . I watched her from the dark , and suddenly she seemed to be aware that someone was there . She stopped , and peered , not seeing me , but attentive and still as a deer . Those were the days of the Brentwood rapes , twelve of them within three months , and the man still loose . All those rape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She walked towards me . Suddenly she screamed . I did n't move , perverse son of a bitch . Then she saw it was me , and said , 78 " Oh , Daddy , " ran into my arms , and there was chocolate icing all over me . I saw she was crying , and had been , I suppose , as she did the frug and ate the chocolate cake . I said , " What did he do to you ? I 'll kill that son of a bitch . " " Who ? " asked Ellen . " The brain , " I said . She burst out laughing . I asked her what she was laughing at , and she said , " Because you hate him so . " " I do n't hate him , " I said . " I do have a certain dislike for him . " " Oh , Daddy , do n't be so noble . I would n't like it if you were n't jealous . " Then I saw that Ellen had been drinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was vodka , straight , which is o.k. , I suppose , but she was high as hell , high enough to mix Bavarian chocolate cake with vodka . The young have stomachs . Suddenly she said , " Oh God , I ca n't go through this any more . I 'm going to tell you . " " If it 's about Roger , " I said , " do n't tell me . " She laughed again , this time the vodka definitely showing  --  eighteenyears old she was  --  and she said , " It 's not about Roger . It 's about you . " Then she said , " Do n't be sore at me , Daddy . I ca n't stand it when you 're sore at me . " I said , " Baby , why should there be anything you ca n't tell me ? " She said , " Wait till you hear what it is . " She hoisted herself up on the kitchen counter , lay down on her side , her woman 's hips , I noticed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Promise me you wo n't be sore at me . " " I wo n't , " I said , " I really wo n't . " " You will be , " she said , and proceeded to tell me . And I did get angry . Irene , the maid , had come to her with the photographs of Gwen and me , and Ellen , of course , had told her to put them right back where she 'd found them . But later Ellen had this impulse , and said , " Show them to my mother . " Which Irene did . " What the hell did you go and do that for ? " " Guess I was wrong , " she said . " But you looked so goddam happy with that girl . And , Daddy , you always look so miserable with Mum . Even when you 're smiling at each other . From the first time I ever had a thought about anything except my toys and candy79and things like that , from the day that I thought of Mum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stayed together . " " There are reasons , " I said . " There 's only one reason , " she said . " Me . I 've seen you with Mum all my life , and I never saw you look at her that way . You 'd put your arm around her and all that , especially when you knew I was looking . And I know you hold hands when you sleep . But I 'm talking about the real thing , like those pictures . I was shocked first , I admit that , because a couple of them are downright obscene . But when I looked at them again , I saw how  --  gee , she 's pretty , she really is . And I began to think , he 's going to give that up some day soon on account of me . I did n't want to do anything to hurt Mum , much as I love you . But I 'm sick of it , Daddy . Like I told Roger tonight , is this it , that marvelous thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so temporary that we must n't lose a breath of it ? Old Roger , he and I were squabbling tonight like an old married couple , and I said , goddam it , Roger , go away , just go away . We have all the disadvantages of marriage and none of the advantages . I got so angry with him that I threw his Bartok out the window . It 's still out there , except he 's so neat he probably picked it up before he drove off . " My curiosity took over : " Have you ever made love to Roger ? Really , I mean ? " " No . " " Well , I 'm sort of glad . " " It 's not me . It 's him . He wo n't . " " I mean I 'm glad you 're still . . . " " Oh , Daddy , that 's only something I tell Mummy . I 've been with quite a few boys . I go to Radcliffe after all , haha . Daddy , did you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Roger ! He 's my going-steady fellow , I could n't tell him . But I 'm eighteen , Daddy , and sometimes  --  like the books say  --  I have very strong urges . Do n't you know it ! Anyway , the minute Roger got out of here , I put on all those old Dixieland 78 's of yours . I 'm careful of them , do n't worry . I listened to them and thought , that 's the way Daddy once was . So what happened , do you know , Daddy ? I love those old 78 's . Roger hates them . Only Miles Davis for him . He says the rest of that stuff is white . " " What does that mean ? " 80 " The way white men like to think a Negro is  --  you know , sort of primitive and bestial . That annoyed me , too . I said , you mean to tell me you are not white ? You creep ! Get out of here . And I really went after him . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except I did n't say love . So what 's the point of it ? Get out , I said , get out . Give me another sip of that vodka ; come on , Daddy , it 's late now , and a little more will just make me sleep . Thank you . A series of petty squabbles , when the whole world is out there waiting . And that 's how I felt that day with Irene ; I suddenly said , Show it to her . Smash it up ! ' Scared hell out of Irene . Then Mum had to fire her of course . But I 'm going to send her money till she gets another job . " Afterwards I was watching you two at dinner . I could n't see where anything had happened . You were just like before . No signs of life . But I thought , Daddy 's not that way ; he 's got life in him yet , like those 78 's just a little , maybe , but some . That 's why I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then right in the middle of Wild Strawberries ' I had this terrible thought . I rememberedthose photographs , and I thought , now they could have chil-dren . " Ellen was an adopted child . Florence and I had taken her on when it became clear we could n't have our own . We did the usual tests with the best doctor , the tubes , the smears and specimens , the semencount , and all the rest of it , and he said looks bad but keep trying , you never can tell . So we did , but nothing happened . I guess it 's Florence  --  well , I know it is . I once knocked up a TV actress , and once the wife of my best friend . Both had abortions . But I did n't tell that to Florence . I just went through that whole test rigamarole with her . " You mad at me , Daddy ? " I had been silent . I did n't answer . I looked at Ellen . An adopted child starts out as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and puts her whole hand around it and you fall in love . You forget she 's not yours . You 're just gone ! From then on it 's what 's good for the kid that decides everything you do . You forget Europe and Asia and Africa ; you spend your summers in a place where the kid will have playmates . And , God , I did love Ellen , all through her babyhood , and her young girlhood , and her teens . But starting maybe when she was seventeen , she suddenly began to look like not our kid , like a stranger had gotten into our house by some mistake . And the terri-81ble thing was that this made a difference . We looked just the same to her , Daddy and Mummy , but she looked different to me . That night as I looked at her , she looked older , and , I 'm embarrassed to say , coarser than I had ever seen her . " Anyway , what I want to say to you , Daddy , is do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be the reason you stay together . " Silence . " Because , " she went on , " when you think of the whole world for its possibilities , all that could be , Daddy , is n't it a shame ? " I did n't say a thing . Now she came off the counter and put her arms around me . " Why do n't you go with that girl ? She makes you happy . " " Ellen , " I said , " I do n't think anyone really knows what 's best foranother person . And you really do n't know a damned thing aboutyour mother and me , not a damned thing . " She washed out the glass , so there would n't be any evidence . " Ellen , " I said , " I 'm not angry at you . " She kissed me on the cheek and said , " O.K. , Dad . " But she sounded heartsick . She left me alone in the kitchen . I had some Bavarian chocolate cake . Sweets comfort me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally I went to the phone and dialed Gwen 's number . " Hello , " I said . " Eddie , did you have an accident ? " " No . Did I wake you ? " " Are you kidding ? What time is it ? " " About four . " " Something happened ? " " Yeah , but I ca n't talk now . " " Something with Florence ? " " Yeah , I 've got a problem . " FF " I ca n't see you for a few days . 1 ' 11 phone you about it tomorrow . O.K. ? " " O.K. " " I 'm going to hang up now . " She did n't speak. 82 " But 1 want to have a real talk with you tomorrow . I got a problem . " She did n't speak . I said goodbye and hung up . There was always the danger , in that kind of call , that Florence might pick up the extension upstairs . When I phoned Gwen from the office the next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd taken the plane to New York . That afternoon , there was a telegram at the office : " Now you have no problem . " Dateline New York . No signature . I could n't keep my mind on Zephyr cigarettes . I went up to my office , and Sylvia , my secretary , told me that Mrs. Anderson had called and said I 'd find a note at home . That sounded a little ominous . But whatever it meant , I did n't feel like doing anything about it right then . 1 felt like sitting there . I made a sling shot out of a rubber band , straightened out a lot of paper clips , and began to shoot . 1 shot at the Zephyr ads ; I shot quite a number at the pictures of myself with various celebrities , scoring heavily . I spared Florence and Ellen . I shot the real heavy clips at the autographed pictures of Mr. Finnegan . Then 1 turned and began to shoot out of the window at mankind in general . I did n't realize till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it , Sylvia ? " " Well . . . may I suggest that you take off the rest of the after-noon ? " " Why ? "  --  " Well . . . Mrs. Anderson . . . " " What did she say ? " " Well , nothing in particular , but she  --  " " Now , Sylvia , let 's not play games . You know she said a lot in particular that you 're not telling me , is n't that so ? " " Oh , no , sir , only . . . " " Get Mrs. Anderson on the phone for me . " " I ca n't  --  " " You know where she is ; get her on the phone , Sylvia . " " You ca n't speak to her right now , Mr. Anderson . She 's in her car , on the road . " " In other words , you do know where she is . " " Mr. Anderson , if you think I like the position I 'm in , between you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 83 " I do think you like it , and I am not very much mistaken , and I will follow your advice and go home and read her note . " All the note said was , " I 've gone to the Springs for a few days . Will be at the Bennetts . " No love . The new maid knew nothing , except the lady had said she 'd be away for a few days , but would call her each day in the morning to tell her what to prepare for me that night . Tonight it was going to be one of my favorites : tamale pie . Every once in a while there is a miracle in southern California . The day turns raw and wet like real weather . It reminds you of the East , and makes you feel something , all different things  --  nostalgia , sorrow , like working , like leaving town  --  but something ! That miracle happened that day . There was a cool , wet wind blowing , and it reminded me of New England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't realized those trees shed . The bad weather also made me feel mean , which is to say , human . It is n't really human or natural for us to feel optimistic all the time , or to pretend to be friendly all the time , or to like anybody most of the time , or to get along with our fellow humans . It 's natural , I think , to be unfriendly and selfish and mean and ornery and involved only with our own problems . The most unnatural sound I know in the world is the voice of the telephone operator in the Beverly Hills Hotel . It is always friendly ! Olga Bennett 's voice , when I finally got her , was excessively cheery . In the background , there were sounds of conviviality . Girls , happily without husbands , were having cocktails . " What are you drinking ? " I asked Florence when she got on . " A Bloody Mary , " she said . " Made with husband 's blood ? " " Evans , we 're feeling very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbands ! " " What happened ? " I asked . " Just hold it a moment , dear , wo n't you , I 'll take it on the extension . " I heard some byplay and chatter , and Olga got back on and said , " Evans . . . she 'll be right on , " and then , " You better be good to Florence , do you hear ? " From which it was clear that Florence had told her the whole story . At that moment Florence lifted the extension phone , and Olga said in this real cute voice , " I 'm gettin ' off ! Love you both ! " and hung up. 84Before Florence could say a thing , I said , " What did Leibman say ? " I knew who the villain was . " Oh , you know , " said Florence , " he never says anything . He sat there and looked at me and smiled , which was just wonderful because it put everything in proportion . But then he did ask , What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that when he 's elliptical he 's trying to make me think . So I was silent a long time , and finally he said only this one thing  --  that we do n't yet know what the solution is , but we can have considerable doubt that the kind of rapprochement we had last night is a genuine rapprochement . Do you understand , Evans ? " " And then he told you to go to the Springs ? " " No , that was my idea . Olga 's been asking me , you know that , and when I woke up this morning , I was furious , not with you , with myself . And although Dr. Leibman did n't really say anything , I know him well enough by now to say confidently that he was furious with me , and just a little disgusted , maybe ! " " Too bad about him . " " Evans , if we do have a chance , it 's for you to go to Dr. Leibman . Otherwise , I really do n't think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Evans ? " " I 'm here . " " That 's not his idea , mind you . He does n't need any more patients , nor does he make a practice of taking both wife and husband . It 's my idea . Evans ? " " I 'm here . " " I wo n't say I insist now , because I want you to finally go there only because you want to . But I will say this , that what happened between us last night represents no real change . It 's time for us to do some very basic rethinking about our relationship . I think we could have a fine life together , but as Dr. Leibman said , I must never , never think I ca n't get along without you . Because that is n't so . I can . And rather than ever be humiliated that way again , Dr. Leibman said , we  --  " " He seems to have done quite a lot of talking . " " Evans , there 's really no point to sarcasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen , Florence , I thought I 'd go away for a while , maybe a85week , to New York , see my father and mother , and see Collier once more and . . . " That was the first I 'd heard of that . I had n't planned to say that . " I think that 's a very good idea , " said Florence . " You 'd get away from us both that way and . . . " " That 's right , " I said . Do n't model your sons after me . " And you can have a chance to . . " Think , " I said helpfully . " That 's right . Evans , I 've been doing a lot of thinking . On the way down here I almost had an accident . My mind was wandering , and suddenly there I was on the wrong side of Highway 94 . That jolt was just what I needed . I remembered Dr. Leibman 's words , You must never say to yourself you ca n't live without him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . I suppose I was going to New York out of some sort of pique at him . Because I found it hard to go once I was alone in the house . Ellen had gone with Roger to the Bergman Festival at the Fine Arts again , and I had a tamale pie all to myself . Later I sat in the living room drinking . I had called up and made a reservation on the eleven o'clock plane , but I wavered a lot , drinking and wavering . Florence had this picture of herself , framed in silver , in which her eyes looked particularly fine  --  large , luminous , decent , and kind , full of pain and trouble she would not inflict on the rest of the world . I looked at this picture and at Florence , at her nose with its high bridge and its judicial austerity ( I guess I never forgave her that her **25;8476;TOOLONG had been on the Supreme Court ) , Then I examined her forehead  --  high , clean , clear of any hair ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I thought she had only turned so completely to Dr. Leibman because she could n't to me . I remembered all the things she had done for me , the support she had given me when I was just starting , the loyalty and patience she had squandered on my behalf , the awful things I had done to her , and how she had seen me through all of it , all of it , for twenty years . She deserves honesty , I thought , deserves to know where she stands , and what she can expect . In other words she deserves a husband . Then I had a thought that surprised me . Dr. Leibman is abso-86lutely right to tell her that she can get along without me , because she might just have to . I went over and kissed her photograph as you might an icon . The photograph , which was smiling , said , " What 's that for ? " and I said in my controlled-drunken voice , " Just because . " Then I took an oath that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend should  --  the truth . If I could n't save myself , if I was too far gone , at least she could save herself . I packed a bag , called a taxi , and just barely made the eleven o'clock . I was stoned when I got on the plane , and after one drink the stewardess would n't give me another . That had never happened to me before . It was a bumpy trip . During the worst of it , when the plane was tossing like a twenty-foot outboard off Montauk Point , I thought we were going to break apart , and I would n't have cared if we had . The next morning I was operating out of the Algonquin again . I told the magazine people that the piece was turning out well , but that I had to see Chet Collier once more . They said fine , fine , which meant that they 'd pick up the tab for the plane . That was now important to me . After that , I did nothing for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had left home without anything to read , so I bought a book about the sexual customsof primitive civilizations , just to see , I suppose , if this would shed any light . I discovered that among the Papuans , when a man reaches forty-five , he can behave sexually as he pleases without censure . I suppose they figure he wo n't be around much longer , so forgive him any and all aberrations , tolerance being due a man who has lived that long . Thus fortified , I continued my search , now in Greenwich Village , in her favorite hangouts , and about midnight , looking into the windows of a coffee shop called The Figaro , I saw her , sitting with a group , but not part of them . She finally saw me . She continued to sit there for a few moments , giving no sign , no longer looking towards me . Then I saw that she was excusing herself , complaining , from her pantomime , of being weary . I walked off down the street , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there , presently , she joined me . Her first words were , " I 've missed you . " I 'd seen that as soon as I 'd seen her . She was living at the Chelsea temporarily , she started to explain , 87while looking for a permanent  --  Then she broke off . We were silent . There was nothing we cared to talk about . We stood on the dark pavement of that side street , not looking at each other . A cab came along . I put her into it , got in myself , and said to the driver , " The Chelsea . " Gwen gave no sign . We did n't speak on the way , did n't embrace , sat side by side , like two condemnedpeople . Her room was exceedingly small . We slammed into each other , overpowering every reluctance . We made sure we did n't have the time nor , later , the energy to think , not once through that long night . When she finally fell asleep , I held the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall asleep , only to start awake and quickly reassure myself she was still there . When I woke in the morning , she was up and dressed , and she said she had made up her mind to quit me . She did n't explain , and I did n't ask for explanation . Clearly she was looking for a way to break off  --  not geographically or verbally , but in fact  --  to smash the thing within herself so it would be over forever . I asked her  --  halfheartedly  --  why we could n't continue as we had been . She said , " If 1 were a strong girl , I could go on that way . But I 'm not that strong any more . " By then I was fighting for days , for hours . I 'd have told her anything to hold on to her for another week . I would have sold my soul for another month . I told her I was going to see Collier , a final interview , to check certain points , and asked If she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should , to finish what she had started . She said it was pointless . I said I knew we did n't see the man the same way , but the conflict of viewpoints , hers and mine , was stimulating to me ; in fact , I had given a lot of thought to what she had said about Collier and me , and I had to say now that she had aroused certain doubts , serious ones , in me ; in fact ( I was fabricating frantically ) , I really wanted to see Collier not so much to find out about him as to find out about myself. 88I called Collier then and there . He was too busy to see me until I dropped that Gwen was coming along . " You see , " I said to her , " he wo n't see me unless you 're along . " She was silent at this , from which I gathered she had acquiesced . I was determined that this meeting with Collier not be a repetition of the previous encounters , in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really felt . I was determined to be fair and honorable and open with him  --  to impress Gwen . As soon as we got there , I offered to let him read my entire draft . This I thought would be taken as a token of honesty . Collier asked me would I change anything if he objected to it . I said of course not . Then he said , " What 's the point of my reading it ? " The rest of the afternoon he spent talking to Gwen . Apparently he had thought a lot about her . And somehow something more was involved . I guess it must have been his taste in revenge . Since I was going to destroy him in print , he would try to take my girl away from me . Gwen , cool as always , unresponsive as if nothing was happening , sat quietly in a chair between us . She smoked and drank and seemed to be lost in thought . Something was going on , but you could n't tell what . If she noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sign . I persisted , despite the fact that the man ignored me . I asked him about some facts in my piece . He said I had them correct . Then about some judgments of mine . He said that it was all cheerleading , could n't matter less . I asked him what he meant by cheerleading . He said I was speaking exclusively to people who agreed with me  --  the Ritualists , he called them . I was not changing anybody 's opinions , nor was I really dealing in controversy . Merely leading cheers and boos . He said everything in my piece was predictable . That I was appealing to prejudices and fixed attitudes . He said that I had lost my ability to think , to even see clearly , that I had had my mind made up when I first came to see him . Even the research provided for me by the magazine had been chosen carefully to fit a certain viewpoint . " I would like you to read me , " he said , " just one sentence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's go , Gwen , " I said . She did n't move . Then she said , " I think I 'll stay here . " She turned to the man , and said , " May I ? " " Welcome , " he said . " Gwen , " I repeated , " we 're leaving . " " You heard what she said , " said Collier , " she 's staying here . " " She came with me , and she 's going with me , " I told him . " Gwen . " Collier burst into laughter . " Listen , bright eyes , " he said , " didyou ever hear of the civil rights of the individual , those that you'realways writing about ? Ask the lady what she wants . " Gwen got up and came to me . " Go on , Eddie , " she said , " I 'm going to stay here . " I spun around and walked to the door , grabbing hat and coat and putting them on outside . Halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . I dropped my hat and coat , walked back into the house , went up to Collier , and went after him . Collier could hardly believe his eyes . And then he gave a sigh , a profound sound of relief  --  I can remember it well  --  like an exhalation of gratefulness it was , thanksgiving . And then he went to work on me . I 'm 5 ' 6 " , but I 'd done some boxing at college . I think if I had been in the ring with him and we 'd had 16-ounce gloves on , I might have held him off for a round or two . But this man had been a Ranger . He took me apart in ways I did n't know existed . It happened so quickly I ca n't describe it . It was a little like being in an auto smashup , where the events are ticked off in tenths of seconds . It had nothing to do with the art of the Marquis of Queensberry , and just a little to do with slaughtering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't hit me there . He made a pudding of my eyes , and broke my nose . If Gwen had n't interfered , it would have been worse . But she really went after him , biting , scratching , calling him every sort of name from her larder of gutter expletives , kicking him in the balls , plowing up his face with her nails and going after his eyes , and so finally forcing him to back off me , saying , " Do n't you dare lay another hand on him , you son of a bitch ; do n't you touch him again , because I swear to God , I 'll come here with a gun and kill you . " Words you do n't believe when a person says them unless you hear them and believe them. 90Gwen got me to the car . I could n't see for the blood in my eyes . I could just make Collier out walking alongside , half apologizing , half explaining for the tenth time that I had started it . I was barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , and the corners of my eyes , Then Gwen was bending over me , tucking her coat around me , and telling me to lie down  --  in the back seat I was  --  and to be still . She drove me to the Chelsea , got me a doctor who gave me a shot to put me to sleep . When I woke , Gwen was in bed with me , holding me in her arms . It was the simplest and purest love she had ever shown me . I went back to sleep . When I woke next , it was night again , and I was hungry , I went to the bathroom mirror and looked at my face . It was pretty bad , but not as bad as I thought it would be . She ordered dinner delivered from the Mexican place near the Chelsea , a big paella and two bottles of Chilean wine , well frosted . It was a hell of a meal , but there was no conversation . When we 'd finished , we sat where we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lot at the back of the hotel . There was nowhere further for us to go . The phone rang . She picked it up and said , " I 'm not in now . " " Who was that ? " I asked . She did n't answer . I knew who it was . I was through . It was over . The next morning I was on the plane back to L.A.The last thing she had said to me was , " I guess the truth is , Eddie , you ca n't get out of the thing you 're in ; you 're too far gone . " I had n't answered . She said , " Be my friend now , Eddie ; if that 's the truth , say it to me . It was n't my fault . " " Yes , " I had said , " I 'm too far gone . " She kissed me where my cheeks burned . And that was it . I went from the airport straight to the offices of Williams and MacElroy and explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People shook their heads about New York , You could n't live there any more , they said . This was before Watts , I cleaned up the accumulated mail . There was a Zephyr crisis . I solved it . They were grateful . I told Florence over the phone not to be shocked at the way I looked , that I had been mugged . She welcomed me , wined me , dined91me , fed me my favorites , stacked my favorites on the hi-fi : Schubert'sC Major Quartet , and Franck 's Piano Quintet . I fell asleep in perfect peace , as the music played . It was amazing how my broken face straightened everything out . I woke in the dead of night , and determined that whatever it was that had all my life run me from girl to girl , I would now control . I resented being at the mercy of whatever that was . If it was sex , which I doubted , I just did n't need it that much . I vowed to kill it . I determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do was make Florence believe I really meant this . The quickest way to convince her , I immediately saw , was to follow her suggestion and have a couple of talks with Dr. Leibman . Which I did . I must have passed the test , because he was able to recommend me to my wife . In his judgment I was genuinely determined now to make a go of it , be a good husband and an honest man . What he did n't know and what it took me eleven months to find out was that I was indeed " too far gone , " that , as the Turks say , too much had been written . But I did my best . It was eleven months until my accident . For those eleven months , I did try. 925Now came the time of the fortress . Florence and I built it together . Or , rather , she had already built part of it , and invited me in , and we finished it together . We lived in it for eleven months , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In its way , the fortress was perfect . She started it the night I came home . The beating at the hands of ex-Ranger Chet Collier was a professional job ; it changed my face . It was n't so much that I did n't look well ; I looked different . Especiallymy eyes . The openings were smaller , like those of an animal peering out of a deep cave . And they had a pleading look . Florence responded to this . She made me so comfortable that for the first time in my life I appreciated having a home . I was forty-four now , and you 'd think that somewhere along the line I would have appreciated having a home . I thought of my parents ' home as a place to get away from . And after the first year or so , I thought of the places Florence and I lived in the same way . I could n't wait to get out every morning . But now Florence made me actually enjoy a way of life I never thought I could tolerate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It 's not a matter of deserving , " she said , " We had a very narrow escape , darling , and I 'm so relieved you 're back safe . We almost lost you , " A few days later , when I was beginning to feel like myself again , she started in on her fortress ideal . " It 's true , dear , " she said , " we set out to be something else . We thought the job with the agency was going to be a means to something . Instead it seems to have turned out to be it . Does n't it ? " 93I did n't say anything . " So we 're disappointed , right ? We are . Let 's admit it . I remember the day you were chosen class poet after four years when nobody but me knew you were alive . I remember you standing up in Woolsley Hall , in front of that whole damned college , and reading your poem . I did n't hear a word , because what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything was possible to you that day . And now it seems like some sort of grotesque joke . To use all that talent and all that training  --  how you worked !  --  to use all that to sell cigarettes . I know I 'm embarrassing you to even say this . But now , just once , I 'm going to say everything . " I must have looked like I expected to be hit , because she laughed and kissed me and said , " Darling , it 's not going to be all that bad . First I want to ask you one question . Is n't that the way life is ? Is n't it , Ev ? Say ? " " I guess so . " " No one reaches their dream , baby ; whoever has ? " " Nobody , I guess . " " It 's o.k. with me if you 're not delighted with everything every day . As long as you do n't take it out on me . Do n't make me the heavy . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but sometimes you forget who I am , baby . I 'm the girl who thought you were somebody when you thought you were nobody . Remember when you used to walk the campus from the Zete house to the post office and never lift your head , when you would cut across the street to avoid the chance that someone might not say hello ? I 'm the girl who made you raise your head and look at people ; remember me ? 1 'm the one who told you it did n't matter how you wore your tie , and the fact that you were foreign or thought you were , that did n't matter , and even your pimples , they 'd go away , which they did , did n't they , baby ? And most of all what your father thought of what you were doing or not doing , that did n't matter , because if you want to be angry at somebody , be a little angry at him . But do n't you dare tag me as one of those Hollywood wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be here . I did n't want to live in this Spanish Renaissance ranch house . I do n't need the three cars . I do n't even use the pool . I 'm here , baby , because you 're here . " You want to quit this place ? " she said . " Come on . Let 's sell it. 94Let 's move . You miss the days when you had a cause to fight ? Well , there 's still a big one , but you wo n't do anything about civil rights . I 've asked you again and again . But you wo n't . So do n't . That 's your business . " She calmed herself  --  it took an instant  --  and then she said , " Well , since we 're here and it looks like that 's the way it 's going to be for the rest of our lives  --  which it does , does n't it ?  --  since that 's so , then I 'll tell you I 'M glad that Williams and MacElroy think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so every once in a while you can afford to write a piece on Chet Collier . And Ev , you 're going to feel a whole lot better about absolutely everything when your piece on Mr. Collier comes out and people start com- plimenting you on it . A lot of people have it a lot worse , my dear . " " I know that , " " But you keep forgetting it . " " I guess I do , yeah , " " First let 's admit some defeat . Then let 's stop looking to the world to solve our problems . Let 's start looking inside ourselves . Let 's pull back now and put a wall around ourselves , an impenetra- ble wall , a fortress , with walls so thick it will keep everything in our environment we detest outside . And inside , where we can con- trol the way things are , let 's have everything as nearly as possible the way we want life to be . That will be our fortress . I 'm ready to live the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love you . I do . Wait a minute . I want to show you something . " Florence had been reading a book by a man named Hesse . The story is called Siddhartha , it takes place in India . It 's the story of the search of a handsome and favored young man for the things in life which have permanent value . It is also his search for harmony with the universe . And for peace . This young man , it developed , had a period when his dissolute side was controlling him rather than vice versa . I suppose that 's why Florence thought it would be a good idea if we read that book together . In time and after a lot of inner pain and hardship , this Siddhartha brought the corrupt part of himself under control . He had a narrow escape though . He got involved with a beautiful courtesan , who almost did him in . But he rescued himself . At the end he was poor and alone , but he had won an ability to accept all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hostile , with equanimity , even with a feeling of love . This philosophy of the author of this book , Hesse , seemed to be a negation of the ego as it 's thought of today . It seemed to Florence and to me , as we read along , that it was a reach for a different kind of ego , not aggressive or competitive or acquisitive , but simple , unafraid , and accepting . And the self that developed would be in harmony with the universe , and even with the environment . It did n't feel compelled to beat anybody or to win anything . And , therefore , it was relaxed , accepting , and generally happy . This philosophy eschewed what was external and material and placed primary value on what was inner and spiritual . I 'm sure I did not understand it too well then , and still do n't . But I understood what Florence herself meant about us very well . I found out that Florence , besides seeing Dr. Leibman three times every week , was also taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat " up the coast near Santa Barbara . I do n't mean to make fun of this either , because those eleven months when we were both influenced by this man and his way of thinking and by the book , Siddhartha , were the most peaceful days of our life together . Florence began to create , inside the walls of our fortress , a world of " real " things , the inner things that endure , She said there was nothing we could do about what was corrupt and dismaying outsideour fortress . We lived in a certain place at a certain time , and we were dependent for our bread and butter on a certain industry , to which we had certain definite obligations . But , she said , we must place around our house a kind of spiritual fence , and that fence would start at the street line . We actually planted a border of beautiful evergreens and rhododendrons on this line to mark the place where the outer world ended and our inner world began . Inside this hedge of evergreens was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selves and create new selves , with new dimensions , and a new structure made of a new fabric . Inside we would divorce ourselves from things of the flesh and the marketplace . Florence said that the struggle of all the great men was preciselythis one . Jesus , Buddha , Tolstoi , Thoreau  --  all the great teachers worked to free themselves from the standards of their fellowmen , the requirements of competition , and the terror of the predators of their own societies . No matter what shameful things96they were involved in outside , they built an inner life that was so strong that nothing could shake it . So I began on this with Florence , the first time we had ever worked on something together . Since I was no longer seeing Gwen , I found myself with a lot of time on my hands . I ended each business day as early as I could and rushed home . There I would change my clothes , and get into something loose and soft . First it was a pair of old pants and a sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a robe , short and lightweight . I soon came to a point where I resented any clothing which constricted me . I even changed my business clothes . I gave up belts and neckties , wore loose slacks , soft jackets , and shirts unbound at the neck . Then Florence said , " Do n't do anything because you are anxious or fearful . There is no cause inside the fortress for fear or anxiety . Do only what you love . Find all the things in the world you really care about , and give your time , and so your life , to them . In this way , spend as much of every day as you can in harmony with your innermost being . " She asked me what had I always wanted to do that I had not done . She said now I should do those things , no matter what they were . Well ( this seemed odd ) , one of the things I wanted most in the world was to raise tomatoes . They were my favorite vegetable . I ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , to raise them myself . Several times I 'd put them into the ground . But then I 'd get involved somewhere with something , and so the borers would get to them , and the blight would leave little black circles with a hole in the center , and the fruit would rot on the ground . But now , nothing was more important to me , and I got results . I forked up a piece of ground in the backyard , just the other side of the swimming pool , where there was almost constant sun . And I put in ten tomato plants and four cherry tomato plants , with plenty of room between . I dug in bone ' meal and dehydrated cow manure . I bought a bundle of bamboo and constructed frames for the plants to grow on . I read up on the tomato blight , early and late , and bought the indicated powders  --  the Sevin powder , and 7% copper dust  --  and a longthroatedduster to blow these pest killers onto the plants . I bought enough hose so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book said , no one ever killed a tomato plant by drowning it . I en-97joyed it all . There is nothing I love as much as the smell of a tomato leaf . Then I decided to make a collection of every book I wanted to read for the rest of my life . It was great fun making the list , and I made it meticulously , considering every book carefully . I realized as I made it that it was already too late , that there were quite a number of books that I had always hoped to read that I would never get to read , and that if I had n't decided when I did  --  well , it would have been quite possible that I never would have read most of the books on my list . Then I found out I could cover quite a few of my titles by buying the entire Modern Library . So I ordered it and built shelves for it myself . Then I bought the titles I had listed which were not in the Modern Library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to have them all at hand so I 'd be ready to start . I discovered that I needed some kind of place where I could be by myself . So I decided to build a tiny room , a fort within the fortress ; above the bathhouse this was , but facing away from the swimming pool and towards the plot of ground where the tomato plants were growing . It was there that I put the Modern Library and the other books ( taking off all the dust jackets ) , and also some shelves for current magazines , and stacks for back issues . I put in a sofa as well as an armchair , so I could be comfortable in every conceivable position , and a couple of those extra bright little lamps , because my eyes were not as good as they once had been . Here , too , I put in a stereo record player . One of Florence 's limitations was that she could not listen to music . She said she liked it , but as soon as some quartet or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conversation was more important to her than Beethoven . I could lie and listen by the hour , dream as the music played , let my mind wander . I bought Beethoven 's late quartets complete . I had had these on 78 's when I was in college , but had never listened to them since . Never had the time ! But now I did , and as 1 listenedI remembered my college days and my home and my father and my mother in the old days , and my uncle Joe , Stavros was his real name , the man who brought the family to this country , and my brother Michael , and the things that had happened to me and him way back in grammar school , things I had forgotten . I spent98whole afternoons that way . And my life seemed rich for the first time . Each day I made entries in what you might call a spiritual diary . Immediately , I noticed my handwriting had improved ! Without tryingI was suddenly writing the 26 characters more evenly and more beautifully . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . I would put down what I had reflected on and experienced that day , It 's amazing how much happened that I never would have noticed before and how important everything that happened suddenly became . As I got to thinking , I wondered why I had become what I had become . I began to feel that now , finally , I was doing what I wanted to do with my life . Often I fell asleep in that little room of my own . And too damned often , when I fell asleep , I would dream of Gwen . I could n't yet control my dreams . There was another thing that I could not control . I could not make love to Florence . I do n't know why , I just could n't . Maybe it was my time of life . Or maybe it was some physical thing . Well , no , I know better than that ; it was psychological all right , but I did n't know what to do about it . No matter what Florence would do , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one , yes , semi , but nothing useful . Florence was wonderful about this . We discussed it frankly . She said not to worry . That Dr. Leibman said I was shiftingspiritual gears , that she understood and wanted nothing from me except what I could do with all my heart , that I had a ways to go to come back to her . But when I did , she 'd be there waiting for me . In every other way we were the closest we had ever been . I even went shopping with her , and she with me . If there was anything I hated in the old days , it was shopping . I used to send my secretary , Sylvia , out to buy my shirts , socks , and underwear . As for my suits , I found a tailor who used to make me two suits from a set of measurementsand trick photographs , and they were always the same two suits : one dark blue for evening wear , one business brown . But now Florence bought my clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not blue or brown , with a spot of color perhaps in my necktie , but gray suits , gray suede shoes , and soft gray shirts . This allowed Florence to dress colorfully , but in such a way that99she 'd be in harmony with my grays . There would always be some hit of gray in her ensemble . Now I became interested in the art of women 's clothes . For the first time I really began to notice what women had on , whereas before I had only been interested in the location of the crucial zippers . I went shopping with Florence for all her clothes , and  --  as she said  --  I soon knew what she looked good in , what points she emphasized , and what points she minimized or even concealed . She really began to value my opinion of a dress . It was fun . I really thought so . In time we began to be known among our friends as the " Golden Couple . " It was n't because we spent , each of us , five minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden . People thought ours was the ideal marriage . Wives were holding me up to their husbands as the perfect husband . When the men , in petty pique , made snide remarks about my very loose past and so on , the women , by God ! , defended me . They said apparently that had been necessary for me at one time , and furthermore it had in all likelihood been wildly exaggerated , out of jealousy , those things always are . " But , " they 'd say , " just look at him now ! " Of course we were constantly being asked out to dinner . We used to walk in , Florence first , and she 'd stand there with her back to me , while I took off her coat and handed it to a maid . Then we 'd go into the parlor , or , in the summer , into the garden and sit side by side on a sofa or garden bench . I 'd tell the host or butler what we both wanted  --  it was always the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan . Everyone knew we preferred to sit next to each other at dinner . So there was always this " Now we just have to break you two up for an hour or so , can you stand it ? " And we 'd fuss and demur , but end up sitting across from each other . She 'd watch what I ate ; I 'd watch what she ate . We were both trying to cut down on calories . I carried a little silver box which held the sucaryl wafer for both of us . I was allowed one cigar a day . She carried it in her purse , so it would not get crushed in my pocket . She 'd give it to me at the end of the meal . We 'd always excuse ourselves to go home just a little earlier than the other guests , the inference of course being that we could not stand to be physically separated one minute longer . I 'd help Florenceinto the Lincoln Continental , and we 'd be off , leaving behind us a great number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing us together , other things did . We allowed each other one final drink , a nightcap , which we had together . Sometimes , if it was not too late , we 'd enjoy a quiet game of double solitaire as we sipped our scotch and soda . Then we 'd slowly mount the stairs , she to her dressing room and 1 to mine . There we took a long time undressing , each with our thoughts . And so in time we 'd meet in the bedroom , face to face with the developing reality of our relationship . She had bought herselfsome sexy nightgowns , rather more elaborate than she used to wear , and some that she knew I liked , the real plain kind . But neither one nor the other worked . And by now we did n't expect anything . I no Ionger felt that any explanation was necessary or possible . Instead we would read ; that is , I would read and she would listen . For a long time we were reading Siddhartha , and it was amazinghow much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the real reason we were with that book so long  --  aside from the fact that it needed to have its meanings unearthed page by page , paragraph by paragraph  --  was that Florence would very soon fall asleep . Then I 'd lie there a long time thinking , what 's happening ? What 's happen-ing ? Sometimes , then , I did think of Gwen . But I tried not to . Gradually I killed it . There was no point . If it was no longer a physical union between Florence and me . I had to admit that for the first time it was possible for us to be friends . I did love Florence . She was my true friend . In fact , for the first time I got to know a different Florence from the girl I married , just as I was different from the boy she used to meet secretly on the top floor of her father 's house . At least now , there was friendship . It was a way of life . Since we were invited out so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon we were either eating out or having guests in every single night of the week  --  every night , that is , except one . One day of the week we fasted . I suppose it was the Eastern influence . I made it a little easier for myself by fasting from after an early lunch Monday till just before a late lunch Tuesday , exactly twenty-four hours . Florencemissed three meals . It 's amazing how I began to look forward to this day when I did n't eat . It was a triumph of a kind , I suppose . Each detail served to bring us closer . For instance , there were regu-101lar times each day when I called her on the phone . First at about twenty minutes of eleven , just before she went to see Dr. Leibman . Then again at about four , when she had come back from her shoppingand her yoga lesson or session or whatever you call it . She , in turn , always called me directly after my lunch to see if I had stayed on my diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this , saying she was checking up on me . Soon every detail of our lives was synchronized . Even down to our charities . We decided we should give one afternoon a week to volunteerhospital work . I used to take off from W. and MacEee every Wednesday after lunch ( on the same day and at the same time I used to take off for Gwen ! How much time I had , once I stopped seeing her ) . We 'd drive out to the Veterans Mental Hospital near Sawtelle , on the way to the beach ( that brought back memories too ! ) . There we 'd give what comfort we could to the committed , reading to them or just listening to their pathetic , distorted stories . Sometimes , I must say , I felt these poor distraught buggers made sense . Despite my gray ensembles and my air of affluence , I often had the feeling that it was n't very far between the top and the bottomin our society . I guess in my guts I knew I had had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence knew it too . So our visits , you might say , were ransom paid . We decided to subscribe to certain magazines together . First , the Nation , in which we both enjoyed Harold Clurman 's reviews so much . They were written in such a way that you could enjoy them even if you had n't seen the plays , which , of course , we had n't . But we found we agreed in principle with every one of Mr. Clurman 's evaluations . Then there was Esquire , where Dwight Macdonald ripped all those phony pictures to pieces with such gusto . We made a list to be sure we saw everything he recommended . And finally the New Republic , where there was Robert Brustein , probably the most brilliant of them all . Clurman and Macdonald and Brustein were really all you needed . They were not only perceptive but witty and amusing . We used to just run to get into bed and read their reviews out loud to each other . We sent for various catalogues . We ordered LP 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fascinating gadgets from the Hammacher Schlemmer catalogue , and outdoor clothes and fishing equipment from Abercrombie &; Fitch . What sport it was when the102stuff arrived ! We 'd always wait until the other got home , so we 'd share the fun of opening the packages . We surprised each other on our birthdays and on Christmas . For my birthday present she bought me an entire camping outfit from Abercrombie &; Fitch , every detail , including a portable toilet . We immediately planned a trip to Yosemite , but meantime I pitched the tent in the backyard , just behind the tomato plants , and laid out all the equipment . SometimesI 'd come home for a quick lunch and eat alone in my tent . Sometimes I 'd just lie there and reflect . We discovered , to our total surprise , that we both had wished for a long time that we could speak and read French better . So twice a week we began to use the lunch hour to have a French lessontogether , the man coming to the house , which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light like a Dover sole meuniere , and we all gabbed away in French as we ate  --  the best way to learn , I 'm sure . We found that we both read very slowly and wasted so much time . So we took one lesson a week in speed reading . I actually doubled the number of pages I could read in an hour , and Florence close to trebled hers . It was amazing how much more we could get done . Physically I was in the best shape of my life  --  except for that one thing : my stomach was hard but Peter Pumpkin-eater was n't . That was just psychological though and , we both firmly believed , temporary . All you had to do was look at me to see that physically I was A-1 . On the Beverly Hills dinner circuit I was known as the man who looked younger every year . Florence got a lot of the credit for this , especially from the women . But the fact was that I did the Royal Canadian Air Force exercises for ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . I used to give copies of the booklet out to my friends , just a little gift out of the blue . But I doubt if many of them had the discipline to do the exercises every day . We took this occasion to organize our finances together for the first time . I had always kept my holdings separate and secret from Florence , and she had kept hers secret and apart from me . I never did know how much money she had . But now , with this new harmonyand that terrible importance lifted off material things , we becamefrank with each other about money and property and insurance and annuities and all the rest of it . In fact we had a meeting with103our lawyers , and we were able , for the first time , to be absolutely plain about how much money she had and how much money I had . When we had carefully reviewed our whole financial situation , I signed a lot of my things over to her for tax reasons ( I was later to regretthis ) . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I wanted to give her everything else . I would have given her all my financial resources and property at one point , except it was explained to me that from the tax point of view this would not have been wise . It began to appear that with both our possessions now amassed in one portfolio , and with the pleasant surprise I had as to the amount of her estate ( she was n't dead yet , but I guess " estate " is the word ) , we would be more or less set for the rest of our lives . It appeared to both of us , in fact , that we had enough to justify a little splurging . So we bought an acre and a half of land , not in Palm Springs , where it would have been prohibitively expensive , but in Indio , only half an hour farther away . There we planned to get away from the winter rains and the L.A. smog , and get us some of that real skin-penetrating heat . We designed the place ourselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We decidedit would be tiny , just for two . We would construct it so well that it would last the rest of our lives . We decided to insulate it with the most advanced and most expensive insulation , so it would do for summer and winter . All so that no matter what happened in the world , we two would be all set with a place . Florence had a very real fear of the Bomb . She would not be poohpoohedout of it . Indio seemed to her much safer than Los Angeles . But it was n't as safe as she 'd like , because there were some factories nearby  --  airplane parts and assembly  --  and there were some bigger ones coming , natural targets . In fact , the day we signed the deal for the acre and a half , we saw some big Delta jobs overhead at about seventy thousand . This disturbed hell out of her . So the very first thing we did was revise our plans so as to put a cellar under the house , and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed jars of water and some fine canned goods in there . Florence figured we 'd be good in that tiny cellar for about three weeks . Of course we had the portable toilet there , too . All in all , this was one of the happiest times of both our lives. 104Florence often said that it was the very happiest time of hers . That is why the events that followed were such a shock to her . We did everything together . For instance , we had my eyes checked , and I got some Ben Franklins . Then we had her eyes checked , and she needed a new prescription . Neither of us liked to carry glasses ; we hated bulges in our clothes . So we both got glasses for upstairs and a pair for downstairs and one for the car and one for the place in Indio . We went and had physical examinations , deciding to make this a regular thing , too . I found that my spleen was enlarged , but that this was no cause for immediate concern . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my diet . So Florence used to call up the morning before we went to dinner at a friend 's and gently explain to the hostess what I could and what I could not eat . Florence 's own examination showed that she would live forever . It seemed to me that her energy level was not as high as it used to be . She got tired easily . But all the man would say about this was that she was no longer twenty . The same doctor examined us both . There was no doubt in his mind that the fact that our marriage was so ideal had a lot to do with our superior and relaxed physical condition . Actually , I had become so relaxed I used to fall asleep at movie theaters , and directly after dinner , even when the dinner was at a friend 's house . Twice I actually fell asleep at the dinner table . Florence too had begun to fall asleep early and rather easily . It was a joke around our dinner circuit : the Golden Couple who were always so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed . Not only had I become relaxed physically ; I had become relaxed psychically . I stopped fighting , not only with Florence , but with anybodyabout anything . Even at the office I had taken on the posture of a benign Brahman whose vision was always focused far into the future , and who had no concern with mundane problems . I began to give the impression that I did n't really care which of two sharply contrasting selling programs was chosen by the client . I had stopped caring . Although there was still a lingering superstition that my presence at a client conference meant everything was going to be all right , there was some grumbling about me , too . In fact , Mr. Finnegan called me into his office one day and told me that the new advertising director for Zephyr cigarettes had complained105about my dozing at two of their recent conferences , and considering the **33;8503;TOOLONG billing that Williams and MacElroyhad with Zephyr , the least Zephyr felt it could ask of the account executive was that he stay awake . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal scheme of things it mattered . Now , looking back at it all , it seems to me there was something much more mischievous at play . I had buried part of me alive , and it was struggling down there , kicking and flailing around . But I was determined to conquer that demon . I did not ever again want to be out of my own control , not for a minute . There were a couple of sour notes . There were three if you count the big one , my impotence , for that 's what it finally came to be known as . After a few months of it , Florence and I had had to accept the fact that for whatever reasons  --  age , bad circulation , underpoweredgonads , whatever  --  I had become sexually impotent before my time . It caused less of a fuss than you might imagine . What woman would n't rather have her man impotent than off with someoneelse ? Then there was the airplane . Here 's how that happened . Every morning at exactly ten before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper on the floor , lie down to do my ten sit-ups , then turn around to do my twenty push-ups . Well , this morning , pushingmy head up and down , this ad caught my eye . It said , FLY-$5 . Well , I stopped the exercises , read the rest of the ad , and rather than go to the meeting of the office pension plan committee , I drove out to the Valley and busted out five dollars worth . I 'd flown ATS duringthe war , but after almost cracking up several times , I swore never to fly again except as a passenger on regularly scheduled airlines . But it all came back for that five dollars , the exhilaration of riding the air . I began to rent a plane three or four times a week . Then one day I did the only thing during the whole fortress period which I did not tell Florence . I made a down payment on a Cessna 172 . I went up in it every chance I could make . I guess , looking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in my plane I 'd talk to myself and say things that I could never say or even think on earth . Oh yes , I had some insane moments in that airplane . I remember once I was talking to Gwen , cursing her , telling her that I knew what she was doing with Chet Collier ( for I was sure she was with him now , the attraction had been too obvious ) . I would106describe what they were doing , shout curses at the heavens against her . Then dive into a cloud , reviling her , and later crying , for I did long for her . But finally I 'd turn for home , and by the time I touched down , I was completely in control of myself again . I loved that plane . The last sour note was Florence 's fault . I discovered gambling . When she figured out the new regime , Florence thought that I really ought to have one evening a week away from her and she away from me . She still did her civil rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baldwin at a party and found him surprisinglyfriendly , I could not get interested , not honestly , in anyone else 's troubles . I know it 's disgusting , but that 's the truth . So Monday , when Florence and some of the other wives went to the civil rights meetings , we boys had a poker game . And with the blessingof the women , because all losses were absorbed by us and all the winnings went to the NAACP . I was a lousy poker player . A good player plays one hand out of three . Maybe . I had to play every hand . So I lost quite a lot of money , and this began to worry Florence . In fact , she suggested that perhaps instead of poker I might join the class in gourmet cookingwhich some of the other husbands were taking . But I drew the goddam line there . Finally Florence had to find comfort in the fact that though I lost quite a bit , my losses were the winnings of other men , and they went from them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer , to find out if my losses were , therefore , deductible . So the months passed . One week we 'd discover a wonderful new ethnic restaurant for our nights out . The next week , maybe , we 'd go see my tailor , Florence having decided that something a little softer in a drape would make me look more like the kind of person I was trying to become . We both started taking tennis lessons from a wonderfulgirl , a former champ that the Bennetts recommended to us . Florence felt much more comfortable with her than with a man . And we really splurged by buying ourselves all nine folio volumes of the Oxford maps of the world . Gradually I stopped using the word " I " almost entirely . I 'd say , " We went there , " " we like this , " " we see so and so , " " we wear gray " That old self of mine , the one which had caused all the trouble , was fast disappearing . It was becoming blended with Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be blended with something even107bigger than Florence  --  the universe . I looked for less and less from life in a material way . I parted my hair the middle and let my sideburns grow longer , because Florence said I looked more spiritualthat way . 1 made certain discreet purchases of prints and lithos of the modern masters and even some original paintings by young artists that no one had heard of but who , Florence was convinced ( she was also taking a UCLA class in modern painting ) , would some day be important . Besides , she explained , these purchases were really investments , excellent ones . And they made for a more diversified portfolio . After all , who knew what was ahead . On the day of our wedding anniversary , 1 took Florence to the best jeweler in Beverly Hills , the fellow across the street from the California Bank Building . Twenty-one years before , when we were married , I had refused to wear a wedding ring . Since we were short on funds then , all we could afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we could afford it and now that we felt the way we did , I bought us , on that day , our anniversary , two identicalheavy gold bands . We wore them out of the store . Florence said it was the first time in twenty-one years that she had felt really married . So the months passed , eleven of them . I was the most orderly and the most controlled I had ever been in my whole life . And when f thought about it , I thought I was happy . And then one morning , when I was driving to work in my TriumphTR 4 , and felt , as far as I can remember , perfectly adjusted and perfectly calm , suddenly , on Christ knows what impulse I . . or was it a hand from out of the blue that turned the wheel of my baby black car and piled it into the side of that enormous trailer truck speeding in the opposite direction ? That was my accident . It changed my life. 1086HE first visitor I had at thehospital was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence was riding California One north to Santa Barbara . It was her morning with the swami . An acey-deucy English novelist with golden hair met her , as she rolled onto the Retreat , and told her the news . Florence turned right around , but it was well past noon before she got to Cedars of Lebanon . The insurance fellow had been and gone by that time . He got to me in Emergency and questioned me before my head cleared . I told him the simple truth , that a hand had come in from outer space and turned my little Triumph into the side of the speedingtrailer truck . He tried to shake my story . But I assured him repeatedlythat 's what happened , and finally he left . I heard later that he went among my friends trying to find out if I had always been " eccentric and fanciful . " I suppose that 's where the story got started  --  the one which was soon all over our circuit  --  that there had been some brain damage . I never denied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the same since my accident . I told Florence I knew that a hand out of the blue makes sense only in a comic strip . " But goddammit , Florence , " I said , " I did n't turn the wheel of that car into the trailer truck . I did n't have any reason to kill myself . " The nurse just then was pushing another big load into the vein of my arm . I remember thinking , " This is not affecting me at all . Why do n't they use the real stuff ? " That 's all I remember , though , becausethat " nothing " load got to me and put me out for almost a day. 109The next morning I did one of those sly things convalescents do . I woke , heard the doctor talking to Florence at the foot of the bed , but did n't open my eyes . He was telling her that while I had six broken ribs , a badly wrenched neck , and all manner of contusions and lacerations ; none of these was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resounding concussion . No doubt there had been some intracranialhemorrhaging . But , as far as he could tell , this was not profuseor extensive , and therefore it was probably not dangerous . That was when Florence dropped her voice and asked him if there had been any brain damage . He said he 'd rather not be held to anything on that yet . I passed the next week mostly asleep or pretending to be . Then they shipped me home in an ambulance . And there I embarked upon the happy life of a convalescent . Convalescence ! I spent most of mine sitting in a deck chair by the side of our pool . I was still being beefed up with drugs and knew no pain . The weather was beautiful , and I enjoyed every minute of it . I watched the world not go by , but come to see me . My visitors came out of the back of the house , which was about a hundred and fifty feet from the pool and on a rise . They 'd come down across the lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their respects , and go . They 'd put on a sort of cheerfulness ; then they 'd turn and go back up the slope with Florence . I could see by the way they walked and the way they kept looking back that they were very worried . I did look considerably worse than I felt . A bit of my scalp had been laid bare , and my head was in a cocoon of bandages . " Now I 'm a swami , too , " I said to Florence . She managed a laugh . I was enjoying it all . I 've always liked receiving presents , and I had lots , some from people I did n't know cared , and even from people I had always thought of as downright hostile . The notes were interesting . I 'd analyze them for Florence . She said I was too cynical . And the choice of gifts ! My brother Michael sent fruit to California ; he was always an original , my brother Michael . My mother and father sent me a letter ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father put his trembly hand at the bottom . His handwriting had sure become shaky . I had a lot of time to reflect , and I remember I determined that the one accurate way of predicting a person 's future was to examine his handwriting . You can  --  with very little110expertise  --  see what 's coming . Did n't you ever pick up an old letter from a friend , written just before he had a stroke or a heart attack and think to yourself , how could I possibly not have seen it coming ? I remember I looked at my father 's scrawl , and I had a premonition about him that soon turned out to be accurate . Mike Weiner , my literary agent , came to see me . The reactions to the piece on Chet Collier had been " unprecedented , " and the magazine had a " fabulous assignment " which they were holding for me , so better get better quick , Mike said . Mr. Finnegan came by in his Rolls . He slipped me a little flask full of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time , and all the rest of it . Then he went slowly and gravely up the slope , talking to Florence . It was obvious that my visitors thought I had suffered brain damage . They looked at me with that extra kindness . When a person has been defeated in life , his fellow predators can afford to be kind . After all , the contest is over . They have survived and therefore won . So they indulge themselves in goodness . This sudden concern and generosity was a surprise , because no one had ever seemed to like me much before . But now it was being poured all over me , the milk of human kindness . So I became suspicious . An invalid is prone to paranoia . I sat by the pool , watching them come and go , the curious disguised as the solicitous , putting on those solemn concerned masks full of Christian feeling as they came down the slope from the house , being ever so cheerful with me , then turning around and walking up the rise with Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They really ca n't wait to write me off , I thought . When I heard that solid middle-class click of the doors of their upper-price-range cars , I knew that as soon as they were out of my driveway they 'd be discussingme much more plainly . And I knew what they 'd be talking about would be brain damage . There was one memory that kept coming back to me , again and again , as I sat there on my deck chair looking into the perfect blue water of our pool . I went to Nassau once for a holiday . I 'm not much for snorkling . But I did lie on the surface of that absolutely clear water and watch the fish below through a glass . Nowhere is the nature of life clearer than under the surface of the sea . You can see it all there. 111through the glass , so simple , so undeniable  --  no romance there , no Christianity either . No fish loves his brother or pretends to . There were those herds of fish  --  I think they call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adapted for grazing . They 'd move along the bottom slowly just like a herd of sheep , heads down , feeding . They reminded me of the great grazing herds that I had seen in motion pictures of Africa . And just as in Africa , along the perimetersof the great herds of antelope and wildebeests and zebras , there were lions , so along the perimeters of these herds of fish were barracuda . Except that I never saw the barracuda strike . I heard that they eat four or five or twenty times their weight every day . But for the longest time I never saw a kill . One day I found out why . It happened too fast . I was lying on top of the water that day watching a herd of these grazing fish through my glass . One of them was having difficulty , just a wobble , a faltering fin , barely discernible . But everyone down there discerned it . I mean they did n't turn and look . Fish do n't do that . But they did something I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely , from their brother fish who had this hint of a wobble . I guess none of them meant any particular harm . But they also knew damned well what was coming . If you ca n't see it , you ca n't describe it , the move the barracudamade . In a short second , that wobbly fish was across the cuda 's jaws like an ear of corn . Then shake , snap , and crunch  --  the grazing fish was in two parts , and another barracuda had his share . The herd meantime was just a little way off , going about their grazing , heads down . Not one of them turned an eye . Things went on , business as usual . My boss , Mr. Finnegan , came to see me for the second time . With him was the man who had stepped into my job when I had the accident . They said , you look good , Eddie , much better than last time . But I noticed that when I talked to one , the other was examining me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my prospects . They had to figure out what their next move was going to be . I was n't absolutely sure that day that Mr. Finnegan wished me a quick recovery . After all , he was human and in business . When someone'saway from a big functioning organization like Williams and MacElroy , and everything seems to go along perfectly well without him , the question naturally comes up : why pay that salary ? I could n't help wondering if Mr. Finnegan was thinking that. 112He was looking at me like an appraiser . For instance , when he told me quite casually , dropping that hot rock in my lap as he bent over a border of poolside hydrangeas , that my assistant was doing all right in my job , was that an accident ? And when this fellow said , Do n't hurry back , Eddie , just take your time , was I wrong to get suspicious ? Was I becoming paranoid , or was I seeing things more clearly ? The odd part of it was that I did n't know if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd have some fun . Instead of maintaining a cautious and discreet silence until I was sure whether I wanted to go back , I popped out with , " Boys , do n't worry ; I 'm not coming back . " Of course this caught them unawares . They just looked stunned for a minute and did n't speak . Were they shocked because I read their thoughts ? Mr. Finnegan looked at my assistant accusingly , blaming him for the thoughts that he , Mr. Finnegan , had had . Then I saw it hit Mr. Finnegan  --  the thought that if I did n't come back , he might be left with this jerk in a very important spot . And I saw it hit my assistant : can I really handle Eddie 's job ? Do I want it , the responsibility ? Am I safer where I am ? They looked at each other and did n't say a thing . They did n't know what to say , since they could n't say what they really thought . There was quite a silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke it . She had this measured , reasonable tone of voice with which she met all emergencies , and a little controlled laugh which meant that nothing could be too bad , as nothing ever is if you 've had money all your life . She said , " Eddie , we 're not going to hold you responsible for anything you say now . He 's only joking , boys . " I muttered something to the effect that I was n't joking in the least . I was enjoying my new game too much to give it up that easily . But they all went off laughing in relief , yukking it up as they walked up the slope towards the house . As soon as the Rolls was out of the driveway , Florence rushed back down and said to me in her most pleasant and controlled voice , " Eddie , please do n't feel that you have to decide anything now . They need you in that company . That cigarette account relies on you . And , hell , Eddie , when you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills on my desk . . . but do n't think of that now . Now just relax , Eddie . " Well , I had found a pretty good game , and 1 played it a lot from113then on . Instead of carefully organizing my thinking and speaking as I always had , I just blurted things out naturally . I even let my mind express itself in those mad jumps it had made all my life , but which until now I had thwarted . I allowed myself to say what I felt on every subject . I found that I could not insult anyone . Everyonewas amazingly patient with me . I would say to a visitor , for instance , that I really did n't want to see him . He 'd smile and leave . The energy I would have wasted in pretending in the old days ! My " brain damage " allowed me to express exactly what I thought of anything : my dislikes , my likes , my wishes . The most dramatic discovery I made was about myself . I found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censoring what I thought , and guarding what I said , that by now I often did n't know what I believed , only what was correct for me to think and expedient for me to say . But now I just popped out with whatever came into my head , without attention to whose feelings I was hurting or whether I was embarrassing poor Florence ( I generally was ) . Soon I could n't wait for more visitors to come . It was amazing how far I could go . The fact is that in my first crude ventures into the unexplored region of the spontaneous truth , I did go too far . I mean , to question the total integrity of Florence 's best girl friends , one after the other , in some subtle or not so subtle way , and watch the poor bitches smile at me tolerantly , patiently , and then become even more friendly  --  what an experience ! Al ! these benefits from just one little auto accident . There I sat poolside , like a demented king , with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill came juice and tea and lunch and an occasional drink . And this stream of visitors , one after the other , coming down full of the milk of human kindness , and going back up dismayed and bewildered and full of pity . How could you get angry at a man who had suffered serious brain damage ? I guess I took advantage . But after a bleeding lifetime living in calculation , saying not what I felt but what was expedient to say , how could anyone blame me for enjoying myself this way ? Most of my victims enjoyed it , too . They competed , I found out later , tellingstories about my awful behavior . And there was no end to their thirst for forgiveness . " Brain damage , " they 'd whisper to each other1.14as they drove off with their cheeks still burning from my latest rudeness . " Extensive brain damage . " Ove " r all this bizarre drama hovered poor Florence , laughing nervously , wondering what horrible thing I was going to say next , or chattering with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment of the harpoon 's impact . Or cutting into one of my sentences just before its point , or trying to change the subject , to make it all seem like just kidding . Sometimes , in front of our guests , she 'd say that I was a naughty , naughty boy , which characterization , of course , was highly accurate . I was an idiot child king , full of the sense of new power and naughty as could be . Florence had her reward . Everyone complimented her on her patience . They did n't see how she took it . Later some of them would send her flowers . But even Florence 's patience began to show cracks . Once I caught her pointing to my head when she thought I was n't looking . So the next time I put a good gaff into someone , I pointed to my head . It was then that Florence got the idea I was enjoying it all . She scolded me and said she would n't let her friends visit me any more if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor right in front of me whether there had been any brain damage . He picked up his cue and said he was now certain there had n't been any . But I was n't ready to give up my new privileges . I challenged him and said what was it , then , that made my head tip over to one side all the time ? Why had n't the pain disappeared from my left temple ? Was he sure that there was no hairline crack in the skull there ? He brought out the latest X rays , which I waved aside . I was sure that there was something wrong , I said . Then Florence made good her threat . She discouraged visitors . No one came to see me . So I entered the second stage of my convalescence . It started the afternoon I drank the entire contents of Mr. Finnegan'sflask . That 's a lot of rum for a man who has been confined mostly to poached eggs on spinach . It hit me hard . And I fell asleep . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little boy , my daddy once brought me a toy I loved . It looked like a fierce little warrior . It carried a spear and a shield . It wore formidable boots . But it had no face . It had everything but115a face . And when grownups asked me what it was , I used to say : " That 's a Nothing ! " And they 'd laugh . Well , suddenly I woke up and I was that . For a minute I was pretty bewildered . But then I remembered how , on the radio , I 'd heard them go up to perfect strangers and find out all about them in a few minutes by just asking a series of questions . So I thought I 'd try that . " Sir , why do they call you a Nothing ? " " Because that 's what I am . " " What do you do in life ? " " Nothing . " " Are you a businessman ? " " No . " " Then what are you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Nothing . " " Not even yourself ? " " Especially not that ! " " What do you hate then ? " " Nothing . " " Are you a Greek ? " " I ca n't even speak the language . " " Are you an American ? " " Almost , but not quite . " " Are you a believer ? " " No . " " An unbeliever ? " " Of course not . I 'm a Nothing . " " Why do you keep smiling all the time ? " " Do I ? " " Yes , you keep smiling at me ; at least I think that 's a smile . What is that ? Where your face should be ? " " Nothing . " It was true . The Nothing just schlunked there with that " nothing " smile on his face . So the interviewer moved on through the crowd to find a more responsive subject . I began to use a weapon children have : silence . I would n't answer questions or express wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor cold , hungry nor sated , for nor against . It was a matter of indifference to me what I had for dinner . I did n't want guests , but did n't protest when they came . I no longer insulted anybody . I sat there silently , smiling vacantly , neither friendly nor hostile . I was n't doing all this consciously or as a technique of some kind . I was getting better , but what resulted from my successful convalescencewas not a cure ; it was a change . I discovered , with quite a shock , that what had started as fancy had come true . I was a Nothing . I asked myself , did I want to go back to Williams and MacElroy ? Of course 1 did n't . Did I want any of the rest of my life ? Florence ? The house ? The whole deal ? Even my identity ? Did I want to be who I was ? Would I prefer to be someone else if that could be managed ? There was one daydream that I kept having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , I would summon it up . It 's a fantasy many men have in one form or another . I 'd be sitting there in my deck chair looking at the front page of the Los Angeles Times . There 'd be nothing on it . Then I 'd turn the pages , one by one . Nothing ! Until on about page eighteen , I found a small but very important item . Eddie Anderson , a vice president of Williams and MacElroy , had disappeared from his Los Angeles home , leaving not a trace . The police had searched vigorously , but no one knew where Mr. Anderson was . Not even his wife . But 1 knew where he was . He had disappeared on purpose . He was alone in a city he had never been in before . Usually that city was Seattle . He knew no one there . No one knew him . He could walk the street all day , and no one would come up to him . Or talk to him . He lived in a tiny furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he just did n't do anything . He had his five hundred get-away dollars , and that would last him a long time . He stayed in , kept his own hours , ate when and what he wanted , read , thought , wandered around . He had no commitments . No one expected anything of him . All was quiet . There were no phone calls from his office , because he had no office and no job . His old life had been washed completely off the blackboard , and when that blackboard dried , it was clean . No trace ! Eddie Anderson had taken advantage of one of those rare opportunities in life  --  the chance to start all over again . He had done what other men dream about but never do . " What are you crying about , Evans ? " 117Florence had come up . " Nothing , " said Nothing . " Please , Evans , tell me . " " It 's really nothing . I 'm o.k . " " Is it that tramp , do you still think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of her in a long time , Florence . " I had n't . But I guess Florence put an idea in my head , because the next time I was in Seattle , Gwen was there too . She lived with me in a slightly larger room , very , very warm , with a three-quarter bed , and a two-burner range that had a tiny icebox under it , and just a few simple things around . This time I had a job , an outdoor job near Puget Sound ( I had never seen Puget Sound ) ; there was no smog . The wind blew , a clean wind , and I came home after work and got into bed with Gwen . Then later we had dinner , then got back into bed . Later at night I 'd read . Hundreds of books . I read all those goddam Modern Library 's I had collected in the fortress  --  how they got up to Seattle I do n't know . In the morning I 'd make coffee . Gwen would he gone  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in the morning : I like absolute silence and the newspaper . I was losing my Nothing look ; my face was growing back , a new one . The worry marks were off it ; the creases of anxiety had disappeared  --  there was nothing to worry about . How simple life was in Seattle ! So for about two weeks I lived in Seattle every chance 1 got . As far as poor Florence could see I was just sitting there in my deck chair , without will or appetite , not insulting anybody now , but not insultable either . I would smile like Buddha ( Florence said ) and keep my peace . Florence soon thought I was carrying the Buddha idea too far . Once she screamed at me , " Say something ! " Nothing said nothing . It was n't long before Florence wished that I was back insulting people . She brought some potential victims down to me , some beauts . But all I 'd do is lie back , pretend to listen , and smile . Or sit there and nod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing smile . As an experiment Florence even brought in some people to pick a fight with me . They 'd say something to outrage me . But Nothing would just smile and say , " That 's o.k. with me . " That was Nothing'sfavorite phrase , " O.K. with me . " Sometimes I 'd whistle some118cool , nothing-type music . Remember " Big Noise from Winnetka , " how it used to come out from between that singer 's front teeth ? Finally Florence got desperate . I think the growing pile of bills finally drove her to action . Also the fact that I did n't seem to be getting either better or worse . I did n't seem to have the least desire to terminate my convalescence . So I guess Florence figured she 'd terminate it for me . One day she brought our doctor in , and there was a carefully staged scene , very jolly . In among the jokes , the doctor declared that if I felt like resting a few more days , that was o.k. with him , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor , there was nothing wrong with me . He had the latest X rays with him , and he showed me that there was no evidence of that hairline crack I kept hoping for . So I was as good as new , haha ! could go back to the salt mines , haha ! Nothing nodded and said , " O.K. by me . " The Medical Scientist laughed , tried one more joke , got a nothing smile as reward , then went up the slope with Florence , both of them chatting vivaciously . A few minutes later , as the second act of this carefully staged drama of resurrection , Florence came down the slope carrying a tray of Manhattans , a little dish of hazel nuts , some tuna fish whipped in mayonnaise with slivers of onion , and a little jar of caviar that she had saved since Christmas . We had our Manhattans together quietly , just like in the days of the fortress . After the third cocktail she asked me gently , when was I going back to work ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to , I said , never . She had another sip and asked what did I mean by never ? I said immediately , again not letting myself think , because if I thought I 'd say some sort of half-lie , or moderate the truth , " I mean I 'm not , ever . " Then Florence said , impulsively , " Goddam her ! " I said , " Who ? " though I knew damned well who . Florence turned away to hide the tears in her eyes , and said , " That diseased , dirty tramp ! " ( There was no use pointing out that Gwen did n't have a social disease . ) " Ever since that girl , " she said , " you have not been yourself . " There was no use reminding her of the eleven months of the fortress , when I was certainly not myself . Because Florence was in such visible , awful pain , it was I who was patient . I told her the truth very gently , that all this had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thinking things over . Florenceseemed to accept this ; she certainly made every effort to . I'd119never seen her look so composed and still so terrified . I wondered how my not going back to work could produce such terror in this person . Her voice very controlled and very calm , she said , " Well , darling , then do tell me , if you are not going back to work , what do you intend to do ? " " Nothing , " I blurted . At which she laughed . I did a little , too . It was such a relief to clear the air . From her reaction , I had said something patently absurd . But then , for the first time in many long years , I tried what I never tried again , to convey the unconveyable . " Please , " I begged her , " do n't be frightened , but I must tell you I do n't like my life . I do n't like what I have done with it . I do n't like what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't like my home , darting  --  please , it 's nothing against you , I lied . I feel I 'm in a trap here , a trap that opened when I had my auto accident . Many times I 've thought that was n't entirely an accident . Maybe I was just trying to get out of the trap that way because I did n't know any other way to get out of it . I think that auto accident was a success . It gave me a breather , a little trip to another country , a few quick minutes to think for the first time in my life . " Then I stopped , because I could see in her eyes no understanding , even the fading of the desire to understand . Only terror ! " Evans , " she said , " let 's be sensible , dear . Tell me , what do you want now ? " So I would n't have a chance to make up anything sensible , I popped out with , " I have n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers . " Well , darling , that is not at all unusual . Dr. Leibman told me it happens to many men at your age . In fact it has a name : evolutionary melancholia , he said it was called . But I 'm sure it 's a sign of your basic mental and spiritualhealth . I would n't like it at all if you did n't face the basic questions , the real big ones , at some time of your life . " " The basic questions ? " I asked . " Yes , " said Florence , " like what is it all about ? And why do I feel disconnected from everything around me ? What is truly important to me and what is n't ? What do I really want ? I 've just been reading Camus ' The Myth of Sisyphus , and I 'm going to give you my marked copy . " I saw it was useless . She was trying the best she could . She was so120frightened . That I would leave her , I suppose ? What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will happen , so what the loving hell ! " O.K. , " I said , " I guess you 're right . I 'm going to go back to work tomorrow . " " Darling , " she said , " take the weekend , and go back on Monday . " So I said , " O.K. by me ! " real nothing style , and she kissed me and I kissed her , and I had another cocktail , then another , and then another . Florence put on some music . It had to be some of the songs that Gwen and I used to play together . I lay there and remembered that time I was in Gwen 's place and she was cooking spaghetti and she wore an apron and nothing else and she was at the stove and I came up behind her and the spaghetti did n't turn out al dente . I had n't thought of Gwen for a long time . Except in Seattle sometimes , But in the last few days the erotic side of me had begun to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sofa with me , I had to turn over on my stomach . There was n't really room on the sofa for both of us . There would have been for Gwen and me , or for Florence and me twenty years before . The size of a sofa sure varies , I thought , and when it seems big and when it seems small is a pretty good measure of the situation . I put my head down on Florence 's shoulder , and soon I was asleep . When I awoke a few hours later , Florence was asleep . I looked at her face , no longer in the iron control in which she held it through her waking hours . It looked fragile and anxious . I felt so sorry for her , and for all struggling humanity trying to keep some sort of order and meaning and continuity in life , not succeeding , not ever succeeding , failing up till the moment of death . I bent over and kissed Florence as she slept , and she smiled with the radiance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try my best at Williams and MacElroy . Gwen was long gone ! Seattle was silly ! I was not a Nothing ! I did owe Florence years and years of love and loyalty . Monday I went back to the office . There were flowers on my desk , my favorite cigars  --  a box of fifty  --  and ice in the bucket . And there was a flow of visitors with good wishes . On my desk were the latest sales figures for Zephyr , which were not so good . The clean cigarette had problems . So , after the presents and the visits and the good wishes on the hush-a-phone , things very quickly got down to business . It was my cue to pull off another miracle . Something was121seriously wrong . Zephyr was running next to last in its field . The parent company put out four brands of cigarettes : a straight , a filter , a menthol , and Zephyr  --  the clean cigarette which has everything . Of the parent company 's four , two were leaders in their fields . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was next to last . It was said of me later that I did n't have my heart in it when I came back . Not true . I tried as hard as ever . But I did the unforgivable . I told the truth . I sent the Zephyr crowd a report after a week ( too quick , everyone said later , for a real study ; I was telling the truth fast so it would n't be diluted with expediency ) . The point of my report was that my " clean " campaign had failed , and it was time to admit that the Zephyr concept had been surpassed . I advised them to give it up . For the first time in my life , I made an entirely negative report without a recommendation . The unfortunate part of it from the agency 's point of view was that my report was given to the Zephyr crowd before Mr. Finnegan or our system of checks and balances , namely the Review Board , had a chance to go over it . My relationship with the Zephyr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one even thought to check on my dealings with them . Furthermore , I had never in all my years with Williams and MacElroy handed in a defeatist report . That 's what shocked them now , they said , the defeatism of it . Nobody would ever forget or forgive my final line . " Gentlemen , " I had said in conclusion , " we are working on a stiff . " Well , the repercussions from my bomb were picked up on every seismograph from Wilshire Boulevard to Madison Avenue . The story was out : Williams and MacElroy 's hold on the Zephyr account was slipping . The Zephyr people were seen having lunch with top personnel from other agencies . They wanted to get some fresh views . Meantime , they said , they were giving my report the benefit of the most careful study . But the fact was that their thinking over my report was done in five seconds . And their reaction , among themselves , was expressed in two words : " Fuck him ! " They let a decent interval elapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over to their office . After the ritualistic swapping of jokes and gossip , their chief cleared his throat and said they had thought my report over especially carefully because they had such profound respect for my sagacity and so much appreciation for my candor , and it was time for candor certainly ; look at the sales122figures ! Nevertheless , they had decided to continue the Zephyr brand . They sat back and looked at me and waited . I knew it was my cue to say that the best man to promote something was certainly not the man who had no faith in its future . But by now I had a rock in my gut . I knew how serious the situation really was . So I ducked . I said I 'd get back to them on it . And I hustled over to see Mr. Finnegan . He knew all about everything and was furious with me . Williams and MacElroy was in danger of losing over five million per annum in billings . Mr. Finnegan called up Zephyr right there in front of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacElroy was not , in this instance , the point of view of its account executive , in this instance , Mr. Eddie Anderson . Furthermore , Mr. Anderson was no longer the account executive for Zephyr . He , Finnegan , wanted an immediate meeting on their problems . They said fine , of course , of course and fine , but they had been developing some other ideas along some other lines with some other people . The fellow talking never finished that sentence . Mr. Finnegan jumped in like Superman and said that he had meant to tell them at the upcoming meeting , but what the hell he might as well say it right now , over the phone , that he was taking over the account himself , and would from now on give it his personal supervision and vision , too . I listened to this catastrophe as if it was happening to someone somewhere else . Way off in the distance I could hear the earth buckle and the buildings crash . Suddenly I was Nothing again , and I could hear that cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr. Finnegan was on the phone , my mind wandered . I thought of this and that and the other , all pleasant but nothing to do with Zephyr cigarettes . They do n't have them in Seattle . " What are you smiling at ? " asked Mr. Finnegan as he hung up . " Nothing , " said Nothing . " There 's really nothing to smile about , " said Finnegan . He turned to press a button . Nothing got out of there ! How slowly things go up ; how fast they come down ! Although the Zephyr people sat down with Mr. Finnegan , it was too late . That memo of mine had killed the account . While they did try to be polite , they finally had to come out with it . In the light of changing123conditions , they said , they had been worried about the inflexible way Williams and MacElroy had been handling Zephyr . While they had felt sympathetic concern for my illness ( look at the presents they had sent me ) , nevertheless , they finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse on the policies I had failed to adjust to the constantly changing market . In other words , there has to be a heavy in this world , and I was tagged . Even my position at Williams and MacElroy quickly became equivocal . No one was sure where I stood . The talk of " brain damage " started again , It disturbed hell out of a lot of people that I was still on salary . The other thing that drove everyone nuts was my goddam high spirits . I seemed so relaxed about it all . Finally some of my peers asked Mr. Finnegan if it was really necessary for me to attend ReviewBoard meetings . As a stockholder , I was a member of this Board , which passed on every policy move our company made . I had been , before my accident , one of its most honored members , perhaps the one with the most highly honed critical mind and the most caustic voice . Now I sat there and made jokes as if my mind was somewhere else . I must say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally suggested that it was n't necessary for me to attend the meetings . From that moment , my days at Williams and MacElroy were numbered . Florence said I was thirsting for failure . And she could n't understand it , she just could n't . The day after Mr. Finnegan took over Zephyr , I showed my class by going over to the magazine 's west coast office and having lunch with the fellows there . They were really glad to see me . And full of compliments on the Chet Collier piece . Of course he had threatened a law suit , And worse , they said laughing . If I ever met him , it might be a good idea if I had a friend or two with me . But that was to be expected from so fine a piece , Evans Arness had fortified his reputation as the leading dispenser of justice then at work with a pen . Waiting for me was another portfolio , bulging with research and tear sheets , Once again the target was a political hopeful , this time right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in carving this guy , do like I did with Collier . I felt that Nothing feeling coming on , but I choked it down . I had promised Florence I 'd try. 1.24They noticed right away that I was not quite myself . Instead of that thoroughly-on-the-ball attention I used to pay , I just schlunked there , thumbing through the research in an absent-minded way while they tried to pump enthusiasm into me . I seemed not to be paying strict attention . Suddenly I said I 'd like to meet the girl who had done the research . Back at the office they brought her in , an eager-eyed kid , maybe twenty-three-four-five , very very admiring of me . She sat there looking at me , and I looked at her till she dropped her eyes . Gwen had sat in that chair , and I was thinking of her , Gwen , now long gone and deep with someone else , and he deep in her . I sat there , thumbingthis kid 's research and wondering if Gwen was o.k. and not listening to what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me now ; I could hear in the distance these people telling me about what they wanted , which was a replica of the other piece . I could hear phrases like " Boy what you 'll do with this guy ! " and " Remember Collier 's cars . . . well this guy 's got motor boats : Catamarans , wave skimmers , you name it . " I kept looking at the girl and thinking of Gwen . Suddenly there were tears in my eyes . I do n't think anybody noticed , except the girl ; maybe she did . I heard all the talk from a greater and greater distance . I was thinking how much verve Gwen had , how smartly turned out she 'd be sitting there neat and compact right there in that office like she 'd once been  --  I wished she were now  --  with her bony little knees cozy out of the hem of her skirt . And suddenly I heard Gwen 's voice saying , " Research the guy yourself . Do n't take anybody 's word for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Fellows , I 'd like to know I can start from scratch on this one  --  excuse me , Miss , I appreciate how hard you worked , but . . . " They all smiled , very relieved that that was all that was wrong , and said sure , sure , of course , naturally , fine , and all that lard . The girl said she had a lot more tear sheets and quotes at home , if I cared to see them . Why not , I said . She was originally out of New York , presently putting up in one of those one-and-a-half-rooms in a building called the Oasis . All over the table , the two chairs , and the studio bed there were piles of books place-marked with little slips of paper and magazines with125other magazines thrust into them and legal pads and stenographic notebooks , pencils , pens , paper clips , and a stapler , I remember , actually in the bed . That girl had earned her salary ! There really was n't anywhere for us to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have been a perfect set-up for me . The girl was a hero worshipper , had read everything I had ever written . She told me at great length what she liked , which was just about everything . I do n't know how I got to give her her reward with all that stuff all over the bed , but I did . It seemed like something we had done many times before . And I had . To Gwen . Love in the research debris . One moment I seemed ardent . Then I 'd fade away like a sick radio . I pumped and I pumped , and I did n't come . The poor kid did n't know what the hell to make of it all . After a while I just stopped and lay there . We looked at each other , I still erect but nothing . Finally I said , " Excuse me . " I got up . There was no point . It was n't the intercourse of love or affection or even of sudden desire . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I whistled " Big Noise from Winnetka " through my front teeth . It surprised me that my longing for Gwen was still that strong , after all those months . And about the piece , I could n't kid myself . Not only did n't I want to do it . I could n't have done it , even if I had succeeded in pretending to myself that I wanted to . 1 was in a phase of disconnecting . So I called the magazine and said that I was n't interested in doing the story . They were shocked . They protested that this left them in the lurch , that they had held the assignment open all these months for me . I said that I had already done that piece , except the names were different . Use the other story , I said ; just change the name Collier to Blanton , and change automobile to motor boat . Stop kidding , they said , I just had to do it ; no one could write it except me , and there was also a gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . So I had to fall back on my illness . I protested  --  the crap was really flying both ways by then  --  that I still felt pretty weak , not like myself ( I could hear that piteous note come into my voice ) , and that 1 had fits of nausea and dizziness . Had n't they noticed how pale I looked under my tan ? 126They had to confess that I really did n't look too well . They made me promise not to go back to work again until I felt entirely better . I promised most solemnly . I walked out of that phone booth . It was three-thirty in the afternoon , and I was a free man . As the song goes , I did n't know where I was going but I was going . One thing for sure , my convalescence was over. 277WAS on the street . I didn'tknow exactly where . It was hot . Above me the sun was shining . There was one place in the cover of smog brighter than the rest . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could taste it . There was something malignant in the air . I needed shelter . I thought of Florence 's little cellar in Indio . That would be cool and safe . But it was too far to go . I did n't want to go there anyway . In some cities you go into a bar and get a drink to comfort yourselfagainst the cold . In Los Angeles you go into a bar to get out of the hot lard people live in and breathe . The interior of the bar was very dark and very cool . It was a great relief . I finished my first vodka and tonic before my eyes adjusted to the point where I could see around me . Then I noticed men standing at the bar on both sides of me . What were they doing there in the middle of the business day ? Each man was lookingstraight ahead of him , disconnected from his neighbor . They all looked to be respectable representatives of prospering companies . Had they quit their jobs , too ? I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar , I seemed to want nothing more than to stand there and feel like a big explosiveon a short fuse . If someone drops a flaring match into this place , I thought , it will blow up . I went to the juke box and found Al Hirt . When " Java " came on , no one applauded my choice ; no one objected . The bar was decorated in Hawaiian-type decor . There were no Hawaiians in sight . I had another vodka , and left. 1.28It was only four o'clock . If I went home now , I 'd have to explain a lot of things to Florence . Outside it was even hotter . My eyes began to water . I could taste the corrosive stuff in the air . I had to get out of it . I passed by a motel . I went in . It was called The Palms . There were no palms in sight . The room was air-conditioned . I fell on the bed . The windows were closed . The ceiling was spotless , no sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been " bombed . " I got up and turned on the TV . I got up and turned off the TV . I had noticed on my way in that The Palms had a pool . I walked around the back to where it was . It looked good , the coolest aquamarine . I knelt and dipped my finger . The water smelled heavily of PTH and chlorine . I went back to my room and washed my hands . The bowl had a strip across it vouching it had been sterilized for my protection . The towel smelled of disinfectants . So did the sheets when I lay face down on the bed . I turned the air-conditioner up to blow the smell away . It blew a blast right across my bed . I had been perspiring , and now suddenly I was dangerously chilled . I got up and went back out to the street . A taxi came along . I hailed it and told the driver to take me to the airport where I kept my Cessna 172 . The mechanics were glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken off the Zephyr account . I was just the man who owned the Cessna . Through my convalescence , the one thing I had not been eccentric about was the schedule of payments on the Cessna . So when I asked them to roll it out , they did . When I got up through the smog , I was at seven hundred feet and just crossing Santa Monica beach . I turned north . I could see all the acrid stuff on my right . Some of it had a yellowish cast . Sulphur . Just north of the Malibu Colony , the stuff thinned . I nosed down and did Zuma Beach at two hundred feet . Then I decided to go up into the Canyons . The air was clear here . The sun was at an afternoon angle . The hills were dark on one side , brilliant on the other . I spotted a herd of deer , most of them still asleep . They feed by night and bed down in the brush by day . I buzzed them , and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were these deep shadows where the sun did n't reach and you could n't see them running . Then they 'd come up and over and down the sunlit slopes . I turned south . Over downtown L.A. the smog looked like some-129thing antique , a gas laid down in World War I , which had killed everyone and never blown away . A few of the buildings came up through the stuff , including the tower where Williams and MacElroy had their west coast offices . I began to circle this tower at a speed close to stall . Around and around . Once again I began to wonder : was it a hand that had turned my car into the side of that trailer truck ? Ridiculous ! Then why did I keep saying that ? Well , because whatever it was , it was involuntary . It was not me . I opened the door on my side , and leaned far out . I waited . The plane circled the tower . I said , " Whoever you are , the hand of my enemy or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were all cussing me out over the VHF Comm . I paid no attention . I just wanted to find out if , given this perfect opportunity , the " hand " would show again , maybe jam the plane 's elevators or give me a heist out ; it would n't take much with me leaning way out that way . Of course it was ridiculous . I circled and circled that tower , waiting for something to happen . I was shouting , " Evangeleh ! " ( that 's the name my father calls me ) " Evangeleh ! Why do you want to destroy yourself ? Evangeleh , say ! Where have you betrayed yourself ? " There was no answer . No sign , no heist , nothing ! I noticed a police helicopter up there next to me . They were wavingme away , and yelling at me over the VHF Comm . I realized that with all that tumult up there , I was n't going to get answers to my questions that day . Especially with me clamoring like an insane prophet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it did again , unexpectedly . They were waiting for me at the strip . Officials had come out of the woodwork especially for me . They promised they 'd do me a lot of dire things . I gave them my best nothing smile and got into a cab . They were waiting for me at home , too  --  Florence and Dr. Leibman . There was that awful calm these people put on when there is a hysterical situation . They even stood up when they saw me . Dr. Leibman grinned at me and was charming ; Florence was charming , and I was charming . But I knew and they knew what the order of the day was . I should have busted up the place right then and there ! What the hell did they think I was ? Some kind of nut ? Just then some cops in civilian clothes appeared , walking up the driveI30from a real alert-looking radio car . When Florence spotted them , she rushed off saying , " Do n't worry , dear , I 'll take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leibman . He gave me his best open-hearth-type smile . I countered with my choicest nothing smile . And we were all even . He said sit down , wo n't you have a drink , like it was his home . I said sure , what have you got , like it was his bar . He laughed . I could see the spaces between his small sharp teeth . So I whistled " Big Noise from Winnetka " through my teeth . He listened like it was a music appreciationcourse and he had to guess the composer . Then there was a solid pause . He kept studying me . When I could n't take it any more , I headed for the pool . Leibman was right on me though . " How am I going to get away from this guy ? " I said out loud . I sat down . He sat down . He was apparently not a man for hints . He turned now and looked at me . He seemed to be waiting for me to speak . I began to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot . I had begun to sweat . I took off my shirt . He still seemed to be waiting for me to say something . But I outwaited him . " Florence said you wanted to talk to me , " he lied . Then he grinned . I peeled off my pants , kicked off my loafers , and jumped in the water . " Well , " said Dr. Leibman when I surfaced , " there you are ! " " Are you still here ? " I said . " Yes . And waiting . " " Well , do n't . Because I 've got nothing to say . " " Say anything , " he said smiling . I had an even better view of the spaces between his teeth . He reminded me of someone . " Start anywhere . For instance , what are your problems now ? " " The only problem I have right now is how to get rid of you . " And I submerged . When I came up , he was laughing and looked just like one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our street . I could n't take him seriously . " Tell me what you 're thinking right now , " he said . " Nothing . " " Nothing ? It 's impossible to think nothing . " I was holding on to the edge of the pool . He cozied his chair alongside. 131Suddenly he said , " What ? What ? " I had n't said a word . " What were you going to say just then ? " " I wish you 'd blast off ! " I said . " Ah , " he said , like he 'd made a big discovery . " Now ! So now tell me why your orientation towards me is so hostile , my friend . I 'd like to hear about that . " I went for pool bottom . This guy 's got me cornered , I thought . I ca n't stay down here very long , and he 's up there waiting . They got me in the last hole left on earth , the one with the water in it . I surfaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Florence ! " I stayed there in the middle of the pool , shouting " Florence ! Florence ! Florence ! " till she came running down the lawn and took the man away . He was sure telling her , all the way up the hill and into the house . I stayed in the pool until I heard his car drive off . As I climbed out , Florence came down from the house . " Well , " I said , " what 's his diagnosis ? " " Diagnosis ! " she said , and began to laugh as if that was certainly a subtle word to use for so obvious a situation . " How did you get rid of the cops ? " I asked . " I promised them you would not drive a car again ! " " You promised them ! " " Yes . " She had a most absolute tone of voice when she expected opposition . " As for your exploits in the air , that is verboten . And not my doing , darling . The Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever got back here . They wanted to tell you that , pending a full inquiry , you were grounded . And that there would be other , more serious consequences . " I jumped back into the pool . Usually I ca n't stay under water very long . But now I circled the bottom like the seals do . When I finally came up , I saw Florence walking up the hill towards the house . I watched her go , and I said to myself , " Why do you torture that woman ? Leave her , for chrissake . Go to Seattle . She 's probably wishing , in her secret heart , that you 'd disappear . She could shed tears for a few days , and it would all be over . " I could n't stand the sight of Florence 's pain . So I went down again . I liked the bottom of that pool better and better . " Poor thing , " I thought , " those bags under her eyes , they were132pretty bad this morning . " She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " meaning I had put them there . I knew that every time she wiped them at night with Spread and Sparkle , or Wipe and Wonder , she blamed me . I ca n't say she was n't right . If I was my wife , I 'd have bags , too . I swam around the bottom of the pool , slowly and easily , like a seal . I suddenly had great new powers for underwater swimming . I remembered the time I went to New York to see Collier with Gwen . Just before I left , Florence told me she was going to have her face lifted while I was away . " What do you want to do that for ? " I asked . " Do I look good to you now ? " " You look . . . well . . . " " Like a wife . I know . Well , Evans , that 's turned out to be slow death . I do n't deserve to be ignored as a woman , night after night . So I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care how I look , I do . " When I got back she had indeed done it . They do it right behind the ears . Just a tuck or two . I told her she looked much better , which was true . But it did n't affect me as she hoped it would . And the new look did n't last . The schmerz soon enough hits you somewhere else . So now it was my bags under her eyes . I came up for air again , and Florence was coming down the lawn towards me , wearing her lioness costume . Not visible , of course , but plainly there . She arranged herself firmly in one of the metal chairs and said , " Evans , I want to have a talk with you . " Whenever she spoke that particular sentence in that particular way , I felt like a servant about to be let out . She 'd sit in a chair like now , blow the uninhaled smoke out of the side of her mouth , and I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good reference . Then I looked at her and realized how unfair I was being . Because the woman was frightened . She was talking to a husband who had just tried to kill himself again , this time in a plane . She was a decent person , scared stiff . " I 'm awfully sorry , Florence , " I said . " Oh , darling , it 's not a matter of that ; I just wish . . . " She could n't talk . " What , dear ? " 133 " I do wish you 'd think of me , just once , as your friend . I 'm not against you , Ev ; all I want in the world is to help you . " " I know . " " Come up and sit here with me. " 1 did . " Evans dear , you told me you do n't want me , you do n't want this house , you do n't like the way we live . I have n't forgotten that conversation . But now , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friend asking  --  what is it you do want ? " " I do n't know . " " Do you want her ? " " Who ? " " Who ! " I did n't say anything . Silence , that 's my strong point . " Evans , I 'm your friend . If that 's what you truly want , you can have her , if that 's what will really make you happy . Evans , do n't be afraid of the truth . " " I really do n't think that 's it . " " Evans , I 'm your friend . " I felt like jumping into the pool again . She must have sensed it , because she said , " Now do n't go jumping into the pool again . You 're such a darned kid . " So I sat there on dry land , out of my element of the moment , silent , forty-four and fucked up , not knowing what I wanted . I wondered , is this what it is , a breakdown ? Because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do or not do , go or not go ; I could barely talk . I felt like going to the bottom of the pool , that 's all . But it did n't feel bad , the breakdown , if that 's what it was . I simply existed , without will , without desire or resistance , without even my own weight . I floated . " Florence , " I said . " Yes , Evans . " " Nothing , " I said . It is said of the giraffe that he has no voice , that when his neck is in the lion 's jaws , he ca n't protest his own murder . " Why do n't you talk to Dr. Leibman again ? " " I did  --  three times . At 50 per . " " He 's a very sensible , decent , and understanding person , and he 's a kind man , too . " 134 " 1 want to talk to someone who is violent arless and murderous . " I looked at her and smiled . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . h. what am I doing torturing this woman ? I should justto Seattle . Really ! It 's not necessary that the life of this decent person be intertwined with yours . Liberate her ! Belot , quietly murder her . " I 'd like to take a nap now , " I said . " I 'll keep everyone away . Would you like a pillow down here , or a drink , or some juice , or anything , Ev , tell me . " " No , I 'm just going to lie down and sleep awhile . I guess I 'm tired . I do n't want to talk any more . " I went to where she sat , kissed her cheek , and said , " I 'm sorry the way I am . It 's not your fault . Please do n't think it has anything to do with you . You 're a wonderful woman . " She made a sound like a gasp , hugged me with all her might , and kissed me , tried to , on the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't . I did hug her , and said , " Thank you , thank you . There is n't a better girl in the world than you . All this is just me . " " You see , Evans , I do n't walk away and leave a person . I 'm not made that way . Go on , now , sleep . " She turned and went up the hill . She did look better . I got up . I felt my belly . It was thickening . My father and my uncles , I remember , were proud of their bellies . A pot meant only one thing among oriental rug merchants : that they were successful , and depending upon the size of the protuberance , how successful . It was an index to their bank balances . Me ? I was embarrassed by extra weight . I began to do push-ups . Then suddenly I fell out of one of them , fell flat on my stomach , and was almost immediately asleep . I have a gift . I can always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to fight , in those first months , or maybe a year or two , we had some terrible quarrels which left her trembling with rage , all night sometimes . But they 'd leave me asleep . There she 'd be sitting up in bed , spoiling for another round , but there 'd be nobodyto fight . Once she got so furious she went downstairs to get a kitchen knife ; she was going to kill me . But when she got back upstairs , I was asleep . And you ca n't do that to a man who 's sleep-135ing . Asleep we all look innocent , thank God . Especially when you 're in the wrong , sleep is an invaluable ally . They tried to wake me for dinner . But I would n't . I knew I could n't cope with things awake . So they moved me upstairs . I undressed as I walked and fell into that big , beautiful double bed , without pajamas , without washing my teeth . I wanted a long cease-fire ! But it did n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know when , at what hour it happened . Sometime in the dark and unconscious middle of the night I woke . Florence was asleep alongside , breathing heavily . I could hear the house . I remember I could hear the sounds of the appliances turning on and turning off , those gentle sounds , freezing this , heating that , whirring and spinning , clicking , starting , stopping . They 're nice peaceful sounds , all those faithful little motors , precision engineered to do their little jobs quietly while we sleep . I remember I was listening to them , and I must have fallen off , because all of a sudden I realized , I remember , I was making love to her , to Florence . And I could . Actually it was just beginning to go into her . And suddenly I woke . And she woke . We looked at each other . And without realizing how horrible it was , I did a horrible thing . I looked at her and recognized that it was Florence , my wife , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I pulled out . I rolled over , away from her  --  violently  --  and lay on my stomach . She lay there looking at the ceiling . 1 could hardly breathe . For once I could n't fall back asleep . It was the longest night of my life . The facts had asserted themselves ! The next morning there was no visible break in our routine . We both liked to read the news with our coffee ; we both liked our papers unrumpled , so our custom was to have delivered to the door each morning two copies of the Los Angeles Times . We sat there , now as always , on opposite sides of the glass-top garden table , both in our robes , both safe for the moment behind newsprint . Florence looked bled out . She was wearing her rose-colored negligee , which looks sweet on her when she 's feeling well . But rose is a treacherous color , and this morning it dramatized her pallor. 136We did n't say a word all through breakfast . I believe that Florencedid n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear strong reaction any longer without first talking to Dr. Leibmanwhichshe was scheduled to do at 9:20 that morning . At 8:30 she went upstairs to dress . I sat there awhile . We were on the verge . It was another glaring gray day . I went upstairs to get my dark glasses. 1 was barefooted , so Florence did n't hear me . She was standing looking at herself over her shoulder in the pier glass , examining the backs of her upper legs . They had begun to ware badly , the subcutaneousmatter quilting up . I felt sort of guilty , as if , somewhere along the line , I should have been able to stop it or at least reassure her that it did n't make any difference . But I had n't , because it did . I tried , now , to get out without her noticing , but she saw me in the glass , and quickly adjusted her skirts as if I was a stranger . I started out , but she called me back . " That party is tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what party ? " " If you 'll think , you 'll remember that the Bennetts are throwing a welcome-back party . For you . Do you remember now ? " " I guess so . I mean we 'll go , huh ? " She did n't answer . Finally I turned and left . I had mortally hurt a person . I went back to the door of the bedroom . " Florence , " I said , " I 'm sorry . " She was putting on lipstick . " Evans , " she said , " if you were really sorry , you 'd do something about it . But you wo n't . So please do n't expect me to believe you 're sorry . I do n't think you 're in control any more of what you say or feel or do . " She was out of the room . I walked down to the pool . But I did n't feel safe there now . After all , how long could I stay at the bottom ? I thought of going to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days . But I could n't summon up the gumption to do that . So I took off all my clothes , lay on the diving board , and waited for it to happen . I was at anyone 's mercy . All I could hope for now was a miracle . Perhapssome awful catastrophe would happen and rescue me ! Maybe I 'd be killed , or Florence would , or there 'd be an earthquake or a war . I understood why a war is so attractive to people . It rescues them from their hopeless personal situations . In fact , it makes every-137thing personal seem trivial . It 's even better than a Turkish bath . It excuses everything and erases everything . Oh , I thought , if only there 'd come a war to rescue me ! If they 'd only blow up an atom bomb by mistake ! I could go sit in that cellar in Indio . So I fell asleep . When I woke , Florence was back from her session with Leibman , and sitting in the poolside armchair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Either murderous or suicidal , I could n't tell which . The most terrifying part of it was that as soon as she saw me , she put on her very controlled smile . She was pleasant . Leibman really earns his money , I thought . He had done a most effective hurry patch job that morning . I admired him in spite of himself . How long would it last ? Till she saw him again tomorrow at exactly 9:20 . He kept her going from day to day ; whatever he did lasted just 24 hours  --  planned obsolescence in the spiritual field . " Are n't you going to the office ? " she said , lightly , as if it did n't really matter to her . " What ? " " I said , are n't you going to the office ? It 's nine-forty-five . " " What office ? " She turned and looked the other way . She was controlling something , because her whole body shook for an instant . I thought , stop playing games with her , tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " I 've quit . " " Well , that 's news . " " Yes , it is . " " When did you decide that ? " " Just now , though it 's been happening all along . " " So what are you going to do ? " " I do n't know . " " Are you sure you know what you 're doing ? " " Does anybody ? " " Evans , that 's sheer shit ! For chrissake ! Yes , anybody does ; peopledo ! " Then she controlled herself again . Clearly Dr. Leibman had told her to be calm under all provocation , to wait things out . Christ , I thought , if I were her analyst , I 'd advise her to empty both barrels of a shotgun into me . " Dear , " she said , " have you told them ? I mean . . " 138 " No , but I 'm going to . . . I 've decided . I have quit . " " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know . Maybe . Maybe everything . I 'm not sure yet . " " What am I supposed to do now ? " " About what ? " " About my life . I 've got to have a life . " I did n't say anything . " You have n't thought about me , is that it ? " " I guess not , no . " " Sorry to bother you with such trifles , but  --  well  --  for instance . what am I supposed to think about what happened last night ? " " Last night ? " " 1 ' 11 spell it out . Before your accident , I thought it was something physical : your circulation , or your gonads , or your nervous system . But now  --  well , it 's there all right , is n't it ? But it 's not there for me . I mean , who did you think I was last night ? " I did n't answer . " Silence . O.K. Well , I 've had it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you expected . I guess you expected me to wait around while you found whatever it is you 've been looking for . Or who-ever . " " I have n't been with anyone else in that time , Florence . " " That 's probably a lie , but if it 's true , it 's your problem . I 'm notgoing to play your hand and mine , any more . You 're a person wholooks out only for himself . I 'd better begin looking out for myself . " She walked up the slope and into the house. **27;8538;TOOLONG , all of the children nodded eagerly , and soon my food was gone . " Can I give you some pot likker ? " Mrs. Spencer asked over my shoulder . Then without waiting for an answer , she ladled some onto the wooden plate in front of me . Mr. Spencer and John had already broken out pieces from a huge chunk of cornbreadand were using it to sop up the cabbage mixture . The only other thing on the table was a bowl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back to the barefooted woman who moved so quietly and with such grace to and from the kitchen bringing the family hot corn pone and coffee . Her features were delicate : nose turned up at the end ever so slightly , which gave her a piquant look . Delicately shaped lips . Hair parted in the middle , drawn back into a bun , much like that woman in the rococo frame . But the eyes of the living woman . . . what was it about her eyes ? Wistful , that was it . The oldest girl looked like her mother except that she was a bit round-shouldered , as if already she was carrying burdens too heavy for her . She had her mother 's low-pitched voice with that melancholy note in it . I found myself thinking that these were the faces of pioneers . Looking at them I had a curious sensation . It was as if a group of faded tintypes from some family album had come to life before me : all of the women with that austere hairstyle ; the faces sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all . I had always supposed that faces in old photographs were grave because the subjects had not thought it proper to smile for a picture . Yet here was the same look in these living faces . The look was there even at moments when a certain dry humor was flowing , as when Mr. Spencer commented about a widowwomandown the Cove who thought herself extra pious , " ' Course she ai n't much of a hand to housekeep : slut 's wool all over the place . When yer mind is that fixated on things above , the dirt 's bound to settle below . " Well , certainly it had taken strength and courage to journey hundreds of miles through wilderness such as we had walked40that morning . It had taken resoluteness to know that the low whistles of a quail in the woods might not be a quail at all  --  but the signal for an Indian attack . It would take fortitude to live and try to keep house in a cabin like this one . Sitting there , I had a strange otherworldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains with Mr. Pentland , I had crossed into another time , another century , back to the days of the American frontier . Was I still Christy Rudd Huddleston from Asheville , North Carolina  --  or was this somebody else ? It was as if the pages of my history book had opened and by some magic , Daniel Boone might walk into this cabin any moment  --  or Davy Crockett  --  or John Sevier . But this was no storybook , this was real . My mind kept trying to grasp it . Ours was the century of progress , everyone said  --  electric lights and telephones and steam locomotives and automobiles . Yet in this cabin it was still the eighteenth century . I wondered if all the homes in the Cove were as primitive as this one . My thoughts were shattered by a man rushing into the cabin . lIe leaned against the chimney , out of breath . " An accident , " lie gasped . " It 's Bob Allen . Hurt bad ! " Everyone was asking questions at once , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hit him on the head . They 're carryin ' him here . He was a-comin ' to El Pano to fetch on the new teacher . That 's when the acci-dent happened . " FourA YOUNG MAN limp and unconscious , his head bloody , was carried into the Spencer cabin on a makeshift stretcher of branches and laid on one of the beds . Mrs. Spencer removed the man 's heavy shoes and covered him with a quilt . I stood shinned , the words whirling in my head , " coming to fetch on the new teacher " . . . That was me . Because of me this had happened . " Who is he ? " I managed to whisper at last to Mrs. Spencer. 41 " That be Bob Allen . " Her voice was gentle , as if she sensed how I felt . " Ever since it weathered-up to snow , Miz Henderson'sbeen a-pesterin ' Bob to favor her by carryin ' word to you . I 've a mind that it were snowin ' too heavy on Sunday for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaumed up in El Pano too . " " Whatn'all happened ? " I heard Mr. Pentland ask . The stretcher-bearers appeared to be father and son . The older man answered , " Bob , he 'd put out as early as he could . Was cuttin ' through the nigh way acrost Pebble Mountain . Solid woods there . High wind come up . In a deadnin ' , a big tulip-poplar tree got wind-throwed . Fumped him right on the head . " " How 'd you find him ? " " Huntin ' squirrels . Had old hound-dog , Bait-em , swingin ' along with us . Bait-em bayed him . Nosed him out . Bob had fell in the bresh . Tree still on him . " Mrs. Spencer asked anxiously , " Doc a-comin ' - ? " Aye . Ought to be pretty nigh here . " Within what seemed like minutes , the strangest group of people I had ever seen began crowding into the Spencer cabin  --  neighbors , I took it , and Mr. Allen 's relatives . I was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without telephones or any obvious ways of sending messages , but travel the news always did . Some of the first arrivals noticed my presence . . . " Howdy do , stranger . . . " Be ye from the level lands ? " . . . " Proud to know you . " But then in the excitement of the Doctor 's arrival , I was soon forgotten . Outside there was the stomping of feet , the whinny of a horse ; then the door opened and Dr. Neil MacNeill strode in . He appeared to be a man in his thirties , big-boned , a large frame even for a man . He had a shock of reddish hair , unkempt , lookingas if it had not been cut in a long time , tousled and curly . His features were rugged with deeply etched lines . Or was it the shadows cast by the kerosene lamp , throwing into relief every plane of his face , that made it seem so craggy ? The figure lying on the old post-and-spindle bed had not42moved . The pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being held close by Mrs. Spencer while the Doctor made his examination . Although it was early afternoon , the cabin was so dark in- side that the lamplight gave an eerie quality to the room . Giant shadows on the walls moved , danced like monsters ready to spring . I watched the bobbing circle of light on the ceiling cast by the opening at the top of the lamp chimney , my eyes drawn to it with almost hypnotic fascination . Only the hard solid wood of the wall against which I was leaning and the draft of cold air seeping through a crack at my back told me that this was real , that it was all actually happening . The Doctor had taken off his coat , rolled up his shirt sleeves . I noticed his arms , so muscular , the hair on those arms blond- red . A voice at my side whispered , " Doc MacNeill 's the only doc- tor in the Cove . " It was Mr. Pentland who had made his way through the crowd to my side . I nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him know how glad I was for one friend in this awful situation . Already , after our trek over the moun- tain together , Mr. Pentland seemed like an old friend . But I dared not talk because a strained unnatural silence had fallen on the room ; all eyes were watching the doctor . His fingers kept sliding over the man 's head on the pillow  --  feeling , probing . Something about the fingers reminded me of my father 's hands , only these were rough and work-worn . The Doctor would not be hurried . He took the patient 's pulse , then forced his mouth open and looked at the tongue . He checked the pulse again ; opened the eyelids and looked in- tently into the eyes ; took the lamp and moved it closer to the still face . Then almost absently , he handed the lamp back to Mrs. Spencer and began checking reflexes of the arms , pulled back the covers to check leg reflexes : Finally when he straight- ened up , resolution was written on his face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to Bob 's brothers and sisters . Come closer , please . " There was a rustling among the crowd . So many pushed for-43ward toward the bed that it seemed as if most of the people there must be relatives of Bob Allen 's . In the forefront was a distraught woman , and beside her , a man with a heavy black beard . Mr. Pentland had remained at my side . I whispered , " Who 's the man , the one in front ? " " That 's Ault Allen , Bob 's older brother , head of the clan now . " The word " clan " seemed odd . After all , these were our own Appalachians , not the highlands of Scotland . But my attention was on what Dr. MacNeill was saying as he looked straight at the tightly huddled group before him , especially at the woman and bearded man , " Mary  --  Ault  --  I 'd best speak plain . " There was a somber note in his voice . " Bob 's bad off  --  " The lamplight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accustomed to hardship , but rigid now with fear . " Be it a  --  mortalizing  --  wound , Doc ? " Her voice had sunk almost to a whisper . The Doctor 's voice was gentle . " Do n't know the answer to that , Mary . But Bob 's pulse is real slow , breathin ' irregular , reflexesbad , one eye does n't respond to light . " His eyes , searching her face , told him that she still did not understand . " That means , Mary , it 's getting almost impossible for Bob to breathe . " The woman was using all her strength to keep from sobbing . The effort of swallowing back her tears made the veins in her neck stand out like cords . " Is  --  Bob  --  a-hurtin ' , Doc ? " " No , Mary . He 's not , for sure . He 's in a coma  --  like a deep sleep , getting deeper all the time . Listen to me now , you and Ault , listen carefully . Where the tree hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull , probably pressing on his brain . If I leave the bleeding there , Bob will die . " He paused , groping for words , and I thought I saw the glisten of tears in the Doctor 's eyes . " There 's one chance of bringing Bob round though . That 's to bore a small hole in the skull to let the bad blood out and try to lift the pressure . Mary , I want to tell you true  --  I 've never tried this operation . I saw this trephine , the burr hole , they call it , done once by an old professor of mine , Starr Gatlin . He told us then that it was a risky operation . You understand what I 'm saying ? It 's chancy either way. 44Mary , you 're Bob 's wife . It 's up to you to decide . Will you let me try the operation ? " In the stillness , it was now apparent how labored the breathingof the man on the bed was  --  gasps for air , irregular , painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soundlessly on her heels , grappling with the stark alternative the Doctor had handed her . Yet no whimper escaped her tight-set lips . Watching her , I felt a great compassion and thought how the grief of the inarticulatecuts so much deeper than the loud wailing of the selfpitying . " I say Naw . ' I stand against it , " the heavily bearded man exclaimed . " Life and death is in the hands of the Lord . We 've no call to tamper with it . " Then Mary spoke . " No , Ault , ye 're wrong . " Her voice was still low , but there was the resolution of iron and granite in it . " We 've no cause to let go so long as there 's one livin ' breath left in Bob . Try , Doc ! Do n't mind Ault . We 've got six young'uns . Did anything happen to Bob , reckon we could n't stand it . Try , I want you to try . Will ye try , Doc ? " The Doctor waited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We-11 , we-11  --  " Ault pulled at his beard . Obviously he was torn , though he seemed like a hard type , grim and cold . " Mary , you 're his woman , " he said at last . " Borin ' holes in a man 's skull do n't make no sense to me . But do n't reckon I 'm called on to stop ye , if'n that 's what ye want . But I do n't mind tcllin ' ye , I do n't like meddlin ' with the Lord 's business . " He looked at Dr. MacNeill and shrugged . " Hit 's up to you . " The Doctor himself wavered for another moment . I thought I understood the cruel dilemma . There was not much hope for Mr. Allen , with or without the operation . In spite of all the Doctor 's attempts to explain the situation to Bob 's relatives , if the patient died during the operation Dr. MacNeill knew that some of these people would blame him . And he would have a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little light , not even proper surgical instruments . How does a doctor weigh his own limitations of knowledge and skill against a man 's only chance to live ? At last the Doctor announced tersely , " We 'll go ahead . All45of you in this room have heard that I 've been given the family 's permission for this operation . Jeb Spencer , are you here ? And John Holcombe ? I need your help . " At this , the crowd surged forward eagerly . Mixed with their desire to help was curiosity about every detail of the operation . They wanted to get close  --  and still closer  --  to see . There was that strange fascination that people have with blood and accidentsand death , like children shivering deliciously at a horror story . I knew that Dr. MacNeill had just made a courageous decision . But looking at him with his tousled hair and his rumpledshirtsleeves as he directed the preparations , ordering this , asking for that , I wondered if it was not a foolhardy choice . Certainlythere had never been such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a mountain cabin ; dirty pots and pans by the hearth ; a baby crying in its mother 's arms ; the smell of chewing tobacco ; all these people crowded into one room with the air getting fouler by the minute . It would be germ-laden . Surely the Doctor was going to ask these staring people to leave . But Dr. MacNeill was saying , " We 'll use that kitchen table . Fairlight , will you clear it off and let Lizzie help you scrub it ? And Jeb , you have a razor , do n't you , and a straight awl and hammer ? " I wondered if the Doctor was going to use the awl and hammeras part of his surgical instruments . Jeb Spencer looked at the Doctor quizzically for a moment , then only nodded and went to fetch the tools . " Need the razor strop too , Jeb . And Ben Pentland , are you here ? Can you help ? Need lots of boiling water . Will you and some of the other men get water from the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard . And Fairlight , how many pans do you have ? " Slowly Mrs. Spencer answered , " Three big'uns and a small'un . But two are dirty . " " Well , get them all cleaned up and filled with water and on the fire . And Jeb , you do n't have another table , do you ? " As the man shook his head , Dr. MacNeill went on , " Then get me46a couple of saw horses and two or three boards . That will have to do for an instrument table . And hurry . " At last came the announcement I had been expecting . " The whole kit and caboodle of you 'd best leave , " the Doctor said gruffly . His eyes swept the room and stopped on me , noticing me for the first time since he had entered the cabin . An expressionI could not read clouded his rugged features , an intense light seemed to burn suddenly in his deep-set eyes . He stared at me for a long time without speaking , fingers plucking the unkempthair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the cause of the accident , that he wished none of them in the Cove had ever set eyes on me . Finally the Doctor turned to the others . " If you close-kin feel called on to stay , then you 'll have to stand off there now , clear to that side . And no crying or wailing . " The people had respect for the Doctor , I could see that . Yet after this ultimatum , only a few of them left . I wanted to slip out , but I was on the side of the room farthest from the door , penned in by the crowd . From the saddlebags on his horse , the Doctor had brought muslin bags containing bandages , sutures , and instruments . Mr. Spencer had found the awl and hammer , and the Doctor had put these tools and all of his instruments into a pot of boiling water . After a time he began laying supplies out on a clean cloth spread on the sawhorse table . As the Doctor turned his back to tend to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began fingering some of the instruments already laid out on the table . Dr. MacNeillwheeled and caught her . " Confound ! You little scamp  --  " She cringed , covered her face with her arm , as if she thought he was going to strike her . " I ought to tan you right enough , for fooling with those . Now you can just tear off for home  --  now . Arid no use blubbering either . " And he began sterilizing over again everything the girl had touched . Though I was impressed by this thoroughness , I could n't help wondering what good it would do in such an operating theatre . Why try to sterilize instruments when not six feet away stood an anything but sterile audience breathing on the scene ? 47One woman at the front of the group , who wore a kind of rustylookingblack cape , kept rocking on her heels so that the cape swayed back and forth , fanning the air . Several people were coughing . One man sneezed with no handkerchief in evidence . As some of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scuffle at the door and turned to see Bob 's wife rushing toward the still form with a double-bitted axe in her hands . As I saw her lift the axe over her shoulder and give a mighty heave , I clapped my hands over my mouth to stifle a scream . With a crash the axe bit deep into the floorboard under the table . Then with shaking hands the woman took a string and tied it around one of her husband 's wrists . I was too stunned to move . To my surprise , Dr. MacNeill took this wild behavior quite calmly . Quietly he said , " All right , Mary . That 's fine . That should be helpful . There 's not a solitarything more that you can do for Bob . Will some of you take care of Mary until this is all over ? " His voice was kind . Then the Doctor began vigorously wielding the razor back and forth on the strop , up and down . Carefully he washed his own hands in one of the basins , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient 's hair was in the basin , Dr. MacNeill began wiping the shaved head with what was unmistakably ether . The sickly sweet odor hung heavily in the close air . Hastily I slipped through and behind the people and out the door just as the Doctor was ready to make the first incision . Outside I breathed deeply of the cold air , trying to get the smell of the ether out of my nostrils and shake off the effect of the nightmare scene . The three hounds were no longer baying . The smallest of them came and nibbled my hand . I patted the little dog 's head , feeling a kinship with this small black and white animal . Once again there poured through me the feeling of being where I did not belong . Here people still believed in omens and witchcraft . I had been born a century later . I wondered if anything but evil could come of this meeting of two worlds  --  evil that had already begun . I came out of my black reverie to see that the ether had driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was standing only a few feet away . I moved closer to her . " Mrs. Spencer , " I began , " did the Doctor call you Fair-light ' ? " " Aye  --  " " That 's a lovely name . " She nodded , but seemed preoccupied . Her eyes were focused on the sun setting behind the tall pinnacle opposite . I looked from her face to the peak . Rugged scenery certainly  --  majestic  --  but I did not understand her intense concentration on it . ' Then suddenly , the sun dipped and the shadow of the mountain fell across us , lying like a dark hand across the top of the ridge where we stood . I felt the woman beside me cringe , draw into herself , go rigid . I said to lighten the moment , " The sun sinks in a hurry here , does n't it ? " She had not heard me . " Mrs. Spen-cer  --  ? " But the eyes in her lovely face were glazed , turned toward that peak across the valley , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but some specter I could not glimpse . I stood there ill at ease , not knowing what to say . In the silence I could hear the sound of shuffling feet as the little knot of people in the yard moved about , trying to keep warm . My hands and feet were numb with the cold ; Mrs. Spencer'smust be too . I wondered how she could stand there barefoot , so stiff , so unmoving , not speaking . But the fire under the water pot in the yard had long since gone out , not even embers glowing now . A long time passed , I had no idea how long . Finally a voice spoke from the shadows : my friend , Mr. Pentland . " You must be real tired , " he said kindly . " Why do n't I take you on out to the mission ? It 's not far now  --  " " But Mr. Allen  --  How is he ? Is he  --  " " Still livin ' and breathin ' , " he announced to the group in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacNeill found the blood clots all right . Says Bob has a fightin ' chance now , if the bleedin ' in his head do n't start up again . " " Oh , I 'm glad , so glad . " I laughed weakly with relief . Mr. Pentland had my valise in his hand and was already starting . I49had had all the walking I wanted for one day , but there was no alternative except to follow him and hope that his " not far " was true this time . Mostly Mr. Pentland walked in silence , not seeming to want to talk , and I was too tired for conversation . I had not realized what a physical and emotional toll the day had taken until we were within sight of the mission house  --  a large square frame building set in a big yard with the dark bulk of a mountain rising sheer behind it . Now that we were almost to our destination , I could feel tears of exhaustion just under the surface . I stumbled once just as we reached the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp opened the front door . Through a haze of fatigue I saw a tall young man with black hair , warm brown eyes , a wide smile , heard a deep voice . A firm hand welcomedme . Then an older woman , tall , almost gaunt , with angular features , led me up the stairs . " Now this will be your room . I 'm hanging your coat here to dry . Wet as water it is . " She seemed to be bustling about a great deal . Or was it just that I was so tired ? " Are you hungry ? " " No . Thank you . No , I 'm fine . I wished that the jumpy woman would leave . She hovered about awhile longer . When she finally left me , I fell across the bed too weary even to undress . The last thing I remembered was the sound of a mountain stream somewhere close  --  flowing  --  flowing into the night . FiveI SLEPT LATE the next morning . Sometime during the night I must have awakened enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sore from the walk over the mountains . GingerlyI tested out this muscle and that , meanwhile letting my mind roam over the events of the day before . Already the day 5ojust past had an illusory quality like a dream . But if a dream , what was I doing in this strange little room ? There was no luxury here : a washstand with a white china pitcher and bowl ; an old dresser with a cracked mirror above it ; two straight chairs ; the plainest kind of white net curtains ; two cotton rag rugs on the bare floor . Curious to know what this Cutter Gap looked like , I slid out of bed and hobbled stiffly over to one of the windows . Nothing had prepared me for what met my eyes . Mountain ranges were folded one behind the other , in the foreground snow-covered ; behind that , patches of emerald green showing through ; on beyond , deeper green . Then the blues began . On the smoky blue of the far summits fluffy white clouds rested like wisps of cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising up and up toward the vault of the sky . The Great Smokies . . . now I understood . That peculiar smoky-blue color and the adjective " great "  --  so right for these towering heights . As I lifted my eyes to those summits , involuntarily I took a deep breath . The night before , as I had stood outside the Spencercabin knowing that because of me a man was undergoing a brain operation , probably dying , I had believed that accepting t his teaching job had been a dreadful mistake . I wondered about this now , less sure . Had Mr. Allen survived the night ? I still did not know . But meanwhile in the face of tragedy and almost becauseof it , these mountains were whispering to me a different message . I did not realize it then , but from that moment this bememy view , a source of peace and strength , a stabilizingenergy that entered into me to quiet the mind and satisfy the heart . Just below my window a double plank walk cleared of snow d from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the rd was a stand of fir trees . I could see smoke rising from the imney of a cabin just beyond the firs . Someone downstairs had heard me and was knocking on my r . It turned out to be the woman who had helped me upstairs the night before . " I 'm Ida Grantland , David 's sister , " said . " You were so tired last night  --  Do n't think you ' to took in what we were saying . " sl " I 'm sorry . You 're right , everything was hazy . Still is , a little . " She was solicitous . " You did sleep well  --  I hope ? " " Just fine , thank you . " Miss Grantland was a plain woman with sparse graying hair drawn straight back into a meager bun so that her scalp showed through in several places , and with a nose too large for her narrowface . Already I could see that she was a tense person . Restive habits betrayed it : the way she often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thumbs in and out , back and forth against the other fingers . " Oh , Miss Grantland , tell me  --  I 've got to know . Mr. Allen , how is he ? Is he  --  ? " I could n't quite say it . " Alive ? Oh , yes . Dr. MacNeill spent the night there . Miss Alice Henderson too . She got back from Big Lick Spring after sundown . Went right to the Spencers soon as she heard about the operation . She 's catching a wink of sleep now . " " Then Mr. Allen 's out of danger ? " " Not yet , I take it , or the Doctor would n't still be there . Now about breakfast  --  everybody else has eaten . When you get , ah  --  changed "  --  and she looked pointedly at the crumpled dress I had slept in  --  " come on down to the dining room . I 'll see you get something . " I wondered who " everybody " was , how many lived in this house . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you later today . " She crossed the room to the window and pointed . " See that smoke ? That 's her cabin  --  just there , beyond the spruce trees . " " Oh  --  yes , I see . She lives by herself ? " " Yes . She said to tell you maybe late this morning . " The woman smiled at me as she turned to leave the room , but the smile seemed like an afterthought : it trailed behind Miss Ida and lingered with me as I dressed . It was as if her brain had ordered , " Now smile . " So her facial muscles had obediently jerked the lips back showing teeth , but producing a wooden effect with no warmth at all . The dining room turned out to be an unadorned square room at the back of the house with unplastered tongue-and-groove52walls , a round golden oak table in the center . As I ate the abundant breakfast Miss Grantland served me  --  hot oatmeal followed by buckwheat cakes and maple syrup  --  she delivered a message : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave early this morning . He said to tell you he was sorry not to be here when you woke up . " " I 'm sorry I overslept . Does Mr. Grantland teach at the Low Gap School ? " " Oh no , that school 's closed . There were some old desks there ; they said we could use them here . " She pointed out the window to a still unfinished building about a thousand yards distant . It was a rectangular building with an incomplete belltower . " David can build anything he sets his hand to . He 's working on the steeple now . " That puppet 's smile again . Miss Grantlandwas trying to be nice but the smile had no real humor in it and so made me feel uncomfortable , patronized . " Then that will be the church as well as the school ? " " That 's right . We have n't the lumber and funds here to put up two buildings when one would do . This will be used for school on weekdays , church on Sundays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ? " " No . This will be the first term . That 's why we need desks . Some of the men promised to help David haul them today . And believe me , he has to grab the help of these mountain men when lie can get it . " It seemed that David Grantland slept in bachelor 's quarters , a tiny bunkhouse close to the creek , and took his meals at the big house , as did Miss Alice Henderson when she was in Cutter Gap . She did a lot of traveling , Miss Grantland said , between the three schools quite a distance apart . " David begged me to come and keep house for him . He said he could n't get along without me , " Miss Grantland told me proudly . " Course I know how he likes things fixed and all that . So I told him , yes , I 'd come help him out for a while . David says maybe we can find a mountain woman to train as housekeeper . But I have doubts myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her thumbs worked nervously as she spoke . Just then the side door banged and suddenly Mr. Grantland53stood in the kitchen doorway . A young girl with a great shock of snarled red hair peered curiously from behind him . In long quick strides , he crossed the room to me , thrusting out his hand . " Miss Huddleston , great that you 're here . Oh  --  sorry . This is Ruby Mae Morrison . Ruby Mae 's staying with us for a while . " " Coffee , David ? " His sister stood with the coffeepot poised . " Should n't . " He glanced at me and smiled . " All right , Ida , maybe five minutes off . Let me wash my hands though . " The long legs strode to the kitchen sink ; the booming voice never stopped . " Not much of a welcome yesterday , was it ? Snowstorm , injured man . Total confusion . " He was back , easing his tall lean frame into the chair beside me . " Say , did you see me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He reached for the sugar . " Thought so . You looked really done in . That was quite a walk you had , " he said , and his look held admiration . Mr. Grantland had black hair , carefully groomed , fine white even teeth , friendly brown eyes set wide apart . They were lookingme over carefully , missing  --  I guessed  --  not much . And there was something about his nose  --  it looked a little different . I was to learn later that it had been broken by a baseball . The girl was still there , eager brown eyes on me . Ruby Mae was a buxom teen-age girl whose abundant red hair looked as if it had not been combed in a long while . I learned later that her stepfather had ordered her out of the cabin in a fit of anger . Since she had had nowhere else to go , the mission had taken her in . Mr. Grantland 's five minutes stretched to ten . Then he left , saying that he and his helpers had another load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned schoolhouse and that he would see me later on , after my visit with Miss Henderson . Already I could see that though the mission house was a palacecompared to the Spencer cabin , it was still primitive . There was no electricity , no telephone , no plumbing . The house was a white frame three-story building with a screened porch 54on each side . Directly behind it loomed a mountain ( I did not know the name of it yet ) , its base within a few feet of the back door . The house itself had been built on the top of the rising ground at the rear of a very large yard fenced across the front . This , together with the church-schoolhouse , a **26;8567;TOOLONG , a double outhouse ( a very drafty outhouse indeed in this January weather ) , Mr. Grantland 's bunkhouse , and Miss Henderson 's cabinz comprised the mission buildings . AT MY KNOCK , the door of Miss Alice Henderson 's cabin swung open and I was looking into her face . My immediate impression was of a woman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She started to greet me , but her sentence stopped midway . As she stared into my face , an odd look leapt into her eyes . For a flick of an instant she stood motionless , her hand still on the doorknob . Almost immediately she realized that she was leaving me standing in the cold . " I 'm so sorry  --  " Whatever it was all about , it had left her flustered . " Forgive me . Do , please come in . " I was as surprised at the room before me as Miss Henderson had been by something about me . There was warmth and color and shine here : firelight gleaming on polished brass and the gray satin of pewter ; firelight reflected on the well-scrubbed and waxed puncheon floor ; the turkey reds and cobalt blues of what looked to be hand-loomed materials set off by old pine and cherry furniture . A bank of windows all across the back of the room let the outdoors in , with the winter landscape and the towering peaks like a gigantic mural . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized how homesick I was until I felt relief pouring through me . Then Mere was some beauty and order in the Cove ; it was not all plainness and squalor . Close on this reaction came the thought that only an extraordinary person could have created this room . And that person was standing beside me . I could get to know her . " Come sit down , child . " There was a trace of amusement in the voice . " First , let me hang up your coat . Here , come overssby the fire . Down to ten above zero this morning . Does my cabin surprise you ? " " I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to stare . After that nightmare scene yesterday , I was n't sure that I  --  belonged here . But this is so beautiful that I want to hug it  --  if you could hug a room . It 's like  --  well , like coming home . " " That 's the nicest compliment my cabin 's ever had . Here , sit in the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Ardmore . " Miss Henderson sat down opposite me , still a puzzled crease between her eyes as she regarded me . I noticed that she was wearing a straight blue woolen skirt and an immaculate white linen shirtwaist . To the waist was pinned a handsome brooch-watch with what looked like a family crest at the top , set with rubies and pearls . Mr. Pentland had said , " braided hair wound round and round her head like a crown . " He was right . There was something queenlike about her . The hair had once been quite blond , but now was sprinkled with gray . But by far Miss Henderson 's most unusual feature was her eyes  --  fathomless deep gray in which there were traces of fatigue . " Miss Henderson , how is Mr. Allen ? " " About seven this morning he opened his eyes , spoke to us , asked about his ailing hound-dog . I think he 's going to be all right . " I felt a great rush of affection toward Miss Henderson at this news . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " Now  --  tell me , Miss Huddleston , why did you come to Cutter Gap ? " I watched one hand smoothing out a crease in her skirt . Surely she must be joking , I thought . But one look at her face told me that she was not . " Naturally , I thought Dr. Ferrand would have told you , " I answered . " I came to teach school , of course . " " Dr. Ferrand is a great man , " she answered calmly . " Only not too practical sometimes , no judge of the female . He sees in any girl or woman just what he wants to see . You 'd be surprised at how little he told me about you . Anyway , what 's your version ? Why are you here ? " I found myself resisting the way the question was put . With a 56 feeling of covering unnecessary ground , I told Miss Henderson about having heard Dr. Ferrand at Montreat present his case for the mountain people , about his pleading not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lives . And about how I had been so moved that I had immediately volunteered . " Looking back , " she asked me , " do you think you were carried away by the emotion of the moment ? " " Somewhat , perhaps . " Though I did not understand why , now that I was here and Miss Henderson was probing my motives , I wanted to be honest with her . " Most girls my age can get carried away by an emotional appeal , I suppose . " " And Dr. Ferrand is eloquent , " Miss Henderson smiled . A smiley woman , Mr. Pentland had called her . All her lines are smile lines . " But I 've had plenty of time to think it over betweenMontreat and now , " I told her . " Over four months . If I had wanted to back out , I could have . " " Why did n't you ? I would be interested in knowing . " " Because Dr. Ferrand made it sound as if you 're desperate for teachers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College , enough to start teaching . Then  --  I 'd like my life to count for something . You know , more than just staying home in Asheville , getting married , having babies . " The gray eyes were measuring me . Did I read cynicism in them ? No , not that . But a down-to-earth quality that I was not accustomed to in people in religious work , too much realism for comfort . A silence more eloquent than any chatter filled the room . It had a quality about it that was new to me , different from the usual embarrassing lapses of conversation in society . The silence was certainly not for lack of something to say , nor from ill-humor or preoccupation . Miss Henderson was a Quaker , I remembered . Was this a Quaker silence ? And in that creative and listening stillness , my mind went back to my life in Asheville . Teas and receptions and ladies ' genteel talk . Church on Sunday mornings . Shopping and dress fittings . Dance-parties and picnics in the summer . A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where was it leading ? 57 There must be more to life than that . Or is there  --  for a woman ? What was I born for , after all ? I have to know . If I stayed at home going the round of the same parties , I do n't think I ever would know . Mother and father did n't understand my eagerness , why I had wanted to come before I 'd graduated . But I could n't wait forever . . . . Then as if there had been no pause at all , Miss Henderson broke into my thoughts to ask gently , " So it seemed to you that teaching school here was the next step in making your life count ? " " Well , yes . I mean I did n't get any other ideas of anything I could do . " Does she mean to back me into a corner like this ? She was the one who sent Mr. Allen to meet me in El Pano . Because of his accident , could she somehow resent me ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , " I added hastily . " It 's also for the children I 'll be teaching . " This sounded lame , not impressiveeven to me  --  as if I had wanted to leave home , and since the Cutter Gap job was the only escape route in sight , I had grabbed that . Miss Henderson made no comment , but I felt certain that the same thought was in her mind . Inside I was squirming under the level gaze from those gray eyes . Yet there was no malice in them , just a calm weighing and measuring and bringing me back , back , and then back again to simple basics . I longed to tell her about that feeling I 'd had of some special mission to perform . But I ca n't lay my fingers on what the mission is yet . So how can I talk about it ? Maybe the feeling comes from readingtoo much poetry  --  or just because I 'm young . But I do n't think so . I want my life to be full . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limit of my ability too . Those were the hopes that sent me on this wild fling into the mountains , were n't they ? Yes , surely that was it . But I said none of this to Alice Henderson . Then as abruptly as she had embarked on this series of uncomfortablequestions , Miss Henderson changed the subject . This was disconcerting too because it was obvious that she had58by no means finished with the matter of my motives in coming to Cutter Gap . " You 'll need some facts about your new job , " she said brightly . " School opens on Monday next . Perhaps you 'd like to know more about the people you 'll be working with , the mountainpeople too . Oh , by the way , they dislike being called ' mountaineers . ' Better to say mountain people ' or highlanders . ' Also those at the mission call me Miss Alice ' " With your coming , that gives us an official staff of three  --  David Grantland , you , and me , with Dr. Ferrand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four months ago with his special task to oversee building the church-schoolhouse . David just graduated from seminary . He 's a Pennsylvanianlike me . Dr. Ferrand was traveling in the East and made a speech at his seminary . " " And Mr. Grantland volunteered ? Sort of like I did ? " " Well , it was a little different . It seems that the Seminary 's Committee on Social Concerns was trying to place graduates or graduate students in various sections of the country to find out where the biggest needs are . A pilot project , they call it . So David agreed to come here . " " I see . . . " I felt deflated . A pilot project sounded so much more official , so much more important than my vague yearning to do " something . " " How long have you been here , Miss Alice ? " " I first came to the Great Smokies nine years ago . Almost ten now . My first school was at Big Lick Springs . That 's Sullivan County ; the nearest railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Cataleechie School got started . Wild scenery there , deep gorges . It 's very isolated . John Holcombewas over there on a hunting trip . He happened on the school one day and we met . Later , he and the Spencers joined in pleading with me to come and give their children a better school . Once I 'd seen Cutter Gap , I loved it . I felt this was my spot . " " But how did you and Dr. Ferrand get together ? " She laughed gaily . " Oh , he came riding into my life one591autumn day , not on a white charger but on a mule . I 'll never forget the picture he made : a man of almost seventy , heavy mustache , cropped sideburns , precisely clipped goatee . And his French ancestry showed . Those large black eyes and the hands that never stayed still when he talked . " An individualist , if ever I saw one . On top of all his medi- cal training , he 'd had a full theological course . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Ameri- can Inland Mission . His passion was  --  and still is  --  to start schools , churches , and orphanages in the remotest sections of the Blue Ridge , the Alleghenies , the Great Smokies , places where no one else will go . " His visit that autumn came at an opportune time . I 'd begun to realize that I could n't carry on the work of three schools by myself and keep making trips to the outside world for financial support . " Dr. Ferrand was a gift from heaven to help us with this work , " Miss Alice went on . " So when I asked him , he finally agreed to take us under his wing . " She paused and that wonderful smile lighted her face . " Of course , the wing is broad . We do n't see much of him . Not nearly as much as we 'd like to . " " Then you built your cabin after that ? " " Yes . I had several reasons for putting up this place of my own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show the people how to use native materials and their old crafts to create beauty . " " What a wonderful idea ! You 've succeeded too . " Look , let me show you  --  " She rose to point out some of the stones in the chimney facing . " See that glistening mica in the rocks ? And look , here are imbedded garnets  --  and rose quartz . Sometimes we even find sapphires . " She spoke knowingly of hewing and notching logs and of riv- ing boards for shingles , of the ways she had adapted the " but-and-ben " of some of the people 's Scottish ancestors for the plan of her cabin  --  that was , one section of the house abutted on another section . " At only one thing did my mountain helpers balk like stub- born mules , " she told me . She gestured toward the bank of6owindows across the room . The morning sun was streaming in , laying patterns of light across the large oval braided rug . " So many windows were unheard of in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my vista . " She laughed . " I fought all right . You see , I wanted a quiet spot with a particular atmosphere , a sanctuary for me and for other people , where they could talk out some of their problems when they want to . " And believe me , there 's plenty for them to talk out . You see , the religious background of the mountain people is mostly the strict Calvinism of their Scotch-Irish forefathers . It has merits . Breeds steel in folks . Better than a wishy-washy religion that really has no convictions at all . But it 's bequeathed to these people a lot of heart scalds . You 'll see for yourself . Their Christianity is one of fear , of taboos  --  you ca n't do this and you must n't do that . If you do , you 'll go to hell . You know the sort of thing . " " I hate a religion of fears , " I said with feeling . " I do too , and my parents before me . My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ardmore , Pennsylvania . But he had one favorite saying that sounds anything but strict . I grew up on it . " Here Miss Alice 's eyes took on a soft rememberinglook . " He was a tall man , stood so straight , but there were curves of fun around his mouth . Before God , ' he would often say to me , I 've just one duty as a father . That is to see that thee has a happy childhood tucked under thy jacket . ' " " I like that . And  --  did you have a happy childhood ? " " The happiest imaginable . And you see , father was wise . He knew that I could n't have an earthly father who would provide joy all my days , and then be able to conceive of God as a stern judge wanting to take all my fun from me . Miss Hendersonsighed . " One of our tasks here is to show folks a God who wants to give them joy . How they need joy ! They have such hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm afraid the hardness is all I 've seen so far , " I told her . She nodded understandingly . " At first I could n't see anythingbut the dirt and the poverty either . That 's what you 're really re-6ferring to . But then as I rode through the mountains during my first few months here , getting acquainted with the people , flashes of something else began to come through . It was like looking through a peephole in the wall that closes on the past , catching delightful glimpses of earlier ways . " I nodded , fascinated by what she was saying because I , too , had experienced that sensation of walking backward into time , only it had seemed repulsive rather than fascinating . Before this , I had always thought of the American frontier as romantic . Now I was not too sure . " The glimpses multiplied , " she continued , " like that day I came upon a mountain girl playing a dulcimer . Do you know what that is ? " " No , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these days . It has from two to eight strings  --  usually three  --  and is strummed with a goose quill . It must be a crude copy of some very old instrument . Well , anywayin a sweet thin voice this girl sang one English and Scottish ballad after another . Once I began to notice , I heard the old balladseverywhere . Strange how music and poetry can preserve the feel of another way of life . Sitting on a cabin porch , I 'd see an English manor house with clipped lawns and lords and ladies strolling arm in arm . " Then my ears began catching seventeenth-century words  --  a lot of them straight out of Shakespeare and Spenser . When the women talked about Bone-Set as a cough remedy , Mare 's milk for whooping cough , or Sweet William for a tonic , through my imaginary peephole I could see a thatched-roof cottage set in an English herb garden . So that 's how I began to visualizesomething beyond the dirt and the poverty . You see , they do have a fine heritage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over . " I remembered Mrs. Tatum saying that Miss Alice was the only person who had been able to help these proud mountain people . Suddenly I saw why they had accepted Miss Alice 's help . She had uncovered a legitimate source of their pride  --  the strengths of a fine heritage  --  and used it , built on it . But a doubt crept in . Even the proudest background can be-6zcome degenerate or lost in a poor environment . What I had seen so far made me think that was exactly what had happened . " My dear , you 're sitting there wondering if through wishful thinking and a good imagination I 'm not reading into these people a lineage that actually died several generations ago . " I grinned at her , startled . " Well , yes  --  I do n't know how you knew  --  " This was my first experience with what I would come to know later as a characteristic of Miss Alice 's : A perception of other people so acute that it not only caught reactions but came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , what solid values are left today out of any good inheritance ? Well , just as soon as you begin teaching , you 'll find one  --  sharp minds , good brains  --  only they have n't had much of a chance . " There 's exceptional awareness too , basically a spiritual quality , I suppose . It could be used to create and appreciate beauty  --  in things , in lives .. Instead , a lot of the sensitivity is used now for smallness ; getting their feelings hurt easily , that sort of thing . But put the fine minds and the sensitivity together , and you have gigantic hungers of mind and spirit . " Then something else they inherited from those ancestors of theirs  --  those people with their proud self-reliance and intense love of liberty  --  and that 's an iron will . But this will that could result in major achievements is now used mainly to keep feuds alive . " " You mean real shooting feuds ? " " Real shooting and killing feuds . " For the first time Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of violence . Probably only two sections of the country are worse  --  the Cosby , Tennesseearea and Breathitt County , Kentucky . " I absorbed this information in silence , thinking how quickly my father would jerk me home if he knew this . " What do you and Mr. Grantland do about feuding ? " I asked finally . ' That 's another story . The fist thing I did was buy a gun and learn to shoot . " " You did ! I thought the Quakers  --  " " Believe in non-violence . Of course . You 're right . I 've had my clear ancestors spinning in their graves ever since . Now that I've63seen violence close up , I believe in non-violence more than ever . But I had to meet these men on their own ground . So now I 'm a better shot than a lot of them , and they all know it and respect it . It 's given me a base for talking straight to them that I would n't have had otherwise . I tell them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . That 's why I long to keep you from doing anything that will shame your sons and your sons ' sons . The room was very quiet . There was only the creak of the snow-laden branches outside and the gurgling of the stream underits ice coating behind the house . The words just spoken had marched proudly out of the Quaker lady 's mouth , and now stood straight and tall in the quiet room . Even when the feudingmountain men were not altogether sure what such words meant , the hearing of them must make them feel good , I thought , cleaner somehow , as if they were hearing a bugle call in the clear cold mountain air . With a shock I realized that two hours had passed . Mr. Grantland had promised to show me the Cove in the immediate vicinity of the mission house and to talk over some teaching plans with me . As I rose to go , Miss Alice held out her hand to me . " Christy Huddleston , I think thee will do . " Something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into her Quaker speech brought quick tears to my eyes . Did she mean that I was accepted ? SixLOOKING BACK I can see that the young walk unabashedly into many a situation which the more experienced would avoid at all costs . Not that I was cocky or overconfident that first day of school . The truth was that I was trying hard to settle the butterflies in my stomach so that Mr. Grantland would think me an experienced teacher . He was only seven years older than I , but somehow he seemed 64 a thousand years older in experience and self-assurance . I thought of the Tuesday before when he had sat astride the raftersof the unfinished schoolhouse , driving in roofing nails with powerful blows , shouting down orders from time to time to the men helping him . Later I had watched in admiration his quick orderly decisions as he had supervised the placing of the secondhandbenches and battered school desks and the installing of the potbellied stove . It was no small project , this building of the combination school-church . Mr. Grantland had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to provide a usable road from the mission to the railroad flagstop at Fairview Flats . He had only volunteers for helpers . Sometimes those who had promised to come appeared for work , more often they did not . That was why progress had been so slow . Now that school was opening , the building of the bell-tower could proceed only on Saturdays and school holidays , so it would go more slowly still . For this first day of school he had put away his working clothes and was dressed in a tweed suit with a white shirt and bow tie . His only concession to the snow was heavy boots laced almost to his knees . The boots were in ludicrous contrast to the dainty heels and pointed toes of my kid and patent leather shoes picking their way along the nicely cleaned boardwalk with David Grantland keeping pace beside me in the deep snow . " Is this a fashion parade on Fifth Avenue ? " His voice was teasing . " Those are silly , silly shoes . Ice-pick toes . " " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed as I slipped and his arm reached out to support me . I could feel the warmth of his hand even through my coat . I wondered if my hair still looked all right and if he liked the way I wore it . The yard was swarming with children waiting for the first glimpse of their new teacher . Most were flaxen-haired , skinny , too pale , none dressed warmly enough for January . Some were cliiiibing over the piles of lumber and rocks in the yard , some running in and out of the building , their high-pitched voices ringing in the clear air . What if I could not handle such lively pupils ? 651 " These children are really excited , " Mr. Grantland said . " There 's John Holcombe . Must have come early to get the fire started . You 'd be surprised what a big event the opening of this school is in these people 's lives . " Seeing us coming , the children had stopped whatever they were doing to stare at me . As we got closer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barefooted . I knew that some had had to walk several miles in the snow . Suddenly I was painfully selfconsciousabout my foolish shoes . Their bare feet made me want to tuck my own feet out of sight to hide the tokens of my vanity . What a lot I had to learn ! At that moment a little boy detached himself from the silent starers and came running up to us . He had carrot-red hair with a cowlick and blue , blue eyes . There was a shy eagerness about him . " Teacher , I 've come to see you and to swap howdys . I memorized your name . It 's shore a funny name . I never heerd a name like it afore . " " Miss Huddleston , " Mr. Grantland said solemnly , " this is Little Burl Allen , one of Bob Allen 's sons . " So this was one of the children who would have been fatherlessif Dr. MacNeill had not operated . All over again I felt grateful for the last good news I had heard about Mr. Allen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . " I 'm delighted to swap howdys with you , Little Burl . " The gentian blue eyes were lookingme over carefully , taking in every detail . He was so little  --  and those icy feet ! I longed to pick him up and get him warm . As Mr. Grantland and I were climbing the steps to the school , I whispered , " At least we could do something about their bare feet . It 's shameful . Why has n't the mission done something about it ? " Mr. Grantland stood looking down at me , his brown eyes crinkling at the corners , a smile tugging at his mouth . " I know it 's a shock . Was to me too at first . But up in these mountains the youngsters have gone barefooted all their lives  --  summer or winter . And they 're as healthy as pigs . " The school room smelled of varnish and wood smoke and wet wool and cedar pencils and chalk . Already there were puddles of water on the floor from the melted snow the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher 's desk and stood gazing at me . Many of the girls looked too shy to say anything , but there was whispering among the boys . I overheard snatches .. . " Got uncommon pretty eyes , ai n't she ? " " Ah , ye always git stuck on Teacher . " " No such thing ! " " Full of ginger . Reckon she 'll have us a-studyin ' fit for a dog ? " " Naw ! She 's too little to tan any britches . " It was a full fifteen minutes before Mr. Grantland could drag the children away from my desk and get them quiet . He had another problem too : getting some older boys inside who were loitering in the yard . To my surprise , the girls had seated themselves on one side of the room , the boys on the other . I did not know at the time that this was a centuries-old tradition , even followed by the adults in church on Sunday . Mr. Holcombe hung around , ostensibly feeding wood to the fire , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battered teacher 's desk on its raised dais and surveyed the situation . Several of the pupils seemed to be older than I  --  including the three boys who had been the last ones to enter the schoolroom . Yet there were some tiny ones , surely not more than five years old . Such an odd assortment of garments they wore  --  coats several sizes too big , with sleeves turned up . Many of the youngsters looked sleepy , many had faces too old and sober , almost like the faces of tired old men and women . There were several cross-eyed children and some whose eyes were quite bloodshot . I recognized four of the Spencerchildren and nodded to them  --  John , Zady , was n't it ? Clara , and Lulu  --  the ones with whom I had shared Mrs. Tatum 's food on my way into the Cove . John was wearing a sweater with carefully button-stitched holes where the elbows had once been . Now Mr. Grantland was introducing me . He was telling them that my home was in Asheville and that Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke , I was trying to estimate the number of children in the room . I counted the numherof desks in each row  --  nine ; number of rows  --  eight . Seventy-67two , with five desks empty . How preposterous ! How could one teacher handle sixty-seven squirming children ? How differentthe reality was from the way it had sounded in front of Miss Alice 's fire during our first staff conference with her . At that time , she had asked Mr. Grantland to take over the Bible , arithmeticand mathematics classes ; I was to handle the rest . Then Miss Alice had helped me plan a daily schedule . On paper the plan had looked so logical . Now I was not sure . The introduction over , I moved in front of the desk . " Thank you . I  --  I 'm glad to be here . I know that both you , Mr. Grantland , and you , Mr. Holcombe , have all sorts of things to do , so we wo n't ask you to stay . " I could not bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at teaching , so I gave them a bright , confident smile , hoping that they would take the hint . A titter began at the front of the room and swept backward . What had I said that was so funny ? I saw amusement in Mr. Grantland 's eyes . Did that mean I had bungled something already ? Suddenly I knew how much I wanted his approval . He asked softly , " Sure you do n't want me to stay ? " The look in his eyes suggested that I would be wise to let him . For a moment I wavered , especially when I noticed how closely he had been watching some big boys at the back of the room . " Lundy Taylor , " he commented in a low voice , indicating a boy as swarthy-complexioned and as large as a grown man . I saw that the face above the red pimply neck could have used a shave and looked sullen and insolent , with a vacant expression . " He 's never been to school before with Allen children . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that these big children , even bigger than I , were my problem . Miss Alice had explained that in the mountains where women were still not accepted as equal , it was important that I grapple with the situation by myself and win recognition on this first day as " Teacher . " That was why she thought it best to stay away . So I tried to put finality into my voice as I said , " Thank you , gentlemen . Thanks so much . " Mr. Grantland was reluctant but without another word , 68nodded and left . As Mr. Holcombe grabbed his old black felt hat and slowly turned to go , he advised , " Miss , let John thar or my Sam Houston help you stoke the stove . " Then he too disappeared . I took a deep breath . So now we were on our own . All at once the children seemed like giants . I leaned against the edge of the desk for support . A little boy in the front row whispered behind his hand , " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " another voice whispered . " Look at her shakin ' . " lle was right . My legs were trembling violently . Suddenly I could appreciate Miss Henderson 's comment about the school prayer . It seemed that Tennessee law required that each school day begin with a reading of at least ten verses of Scripture and then a prayer . When I had confided to Miss Henderson that I was not sure I could pray before a roomful of children , she had replied crisply , " You 'll need all the prayers you can get . " The evening before I had decided that for the Scripture I would read the 24th Psalm . I opened my Bible and in a voice as firm as I could make it , read : " The earth is the Lord 's , and the fullness thereof ; the world , and they that dwell therein . For he bath founded it upon the seas , and established it upon the floods . Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord ? or who shall stand in his holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure heart . The laughing started again , this time even more openly . I could not understand . Was it the " clean hands " that the pupils thought so funny ? the giggling did not make the prayer any easier , but I held up one hand to try to quiet things down and plunged in : " We thank Thee for those who cared enough to fix up this beautiful new school for us . Help us to appreciate the chance we have here to learn . Be with us as we begin our school . Amen . " " And now we 'll have a singing period , " I announced . " Let 's Start off with America . ' " 69 " Do n't recollect that ' un , " a small voice in the front row retorted . " Do n't know America ' ! You 're teasing me ! You know , the one that goes  --  " Though I was still a little trembly , I cleared my throat and began " My coun-try ' t is of thee , Sweet land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the children were shaking their heads . " No ma'am , we 're not throwin ' off on you " . . . " No , Teacher , jest never learnt hit . " It scarcely seemed possible that any American schoolchild anywhere would not know " America , " but I decided that this was no time to make an issue of it . " Well then , America the Beautiful . ' That 's a good one . " Once again heads wagged . " Vow and declare , Teacher , never heerd tell of it " . . . " Guess , Teacher , you 'd better rassle up a song we can handle . " " Then you tell me the songs you do know , " I said in desperation . A small forest of hands shot into the air . Since I did not vet know names , I had to point to call on each child . " All right , your song ? " " When the Roll Is Called up Yonder , ' " an older girl answered . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Went A-Courtin ' "  --  from a little fellow . " And your song ? " I pointed to a larger boy . " Oh , for a Faith That Will Not Shrink , ' " he said proudly . I thought this was rapidly turning into the most incongruous list I 'd ever heard . Fingers were wiggling violently to my left . " Yes ? " " Marching Through Georgia . ' Could we commence with that ' un ? " " We 'll see . All right , one more ? " " Sourwood Mountain . ' " " Yes , yes , " a chorus went up . " Let 's settle on that . " " Yes , Teacher , that ' un first . That 's the sweepingest song . " 70Someone in the room went " Fa-sol-la " to give the pitch and they were off , the singing quite out of my hands : " I 've got a gal in the Sourwood Moun-tain She 's so good and kind , She 's broke the heart of many a poor fellow , But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet tapped softly , fingers drummed on desks , heads wagged to the rhythm . Some of the boys and girls even sang parts . I could see that these mountain children had music in them . They sang more unself-consciously than they talked , and with more emotion , charm and skill than I had ever heard in impromptu singing : " I 've got a gal in the Buffalo Hollow , Hey-tank-toddle all the day , Oh , she wo n't come and I wo n't follow , And a hey-tank-toddle all the day . " The children smiled at me , first shyly and then broadly , and I found myself smiling back at them and getting caught up in the fun of the mountain song . After all the songs had been sung , innumerable verses of each one , I was thinking reluctantly that my next task was to get an attendance roll on paper , the children 's names and some information about how much schooling they had had . Last year some of the children had gone to the Low Gap School ( the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there the school year had been only four months , and no attendance roll or grade books had been kept to hand over to the new school . Apparently this was because the teacher had been almost as ignorantas the pupils . There were many stories about teachers in these mountains , like some of whom Miss Alice had told me : one man who had stubbornly refused to believe or to teach that the earth was round ; another who had used just one sentence written on the blackboard  --  " Where will you spend eternity ? "  --  to teach both reading and spelling ; a woman who had taught that the stars and the stripes on the American flag were God 's pledge that the earth would never be destroyed by another flood . I beckoned to Ruby Mae and she came obediently up to the desk . " Could you and two other girls help me take a roll ? " 71 " Well 'm , guess so . What 's take a roll ? ' " " Write down the pupils ' names , ages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . Ruby Mae , who 's that tall brunette girl there ? In the second row , third from the front ? Brown eyes ? " " Oh , you mean with the dark hair ? That thar 's Lizette Hol-combe . " " She 'll do fine . Now one more . The blonde girl ? Red bow in her hair ? " " That 's my best friend , Bessie Coburn . " " Well , would you get them up here ? This is a special job , an important one . " Ruby Mae was puffed with pride already as she went back to enlist the two girls . " We want to write down the full name of each pupil , " I explained , handing each of them a ruled tablet and a pencil . " Age . . . beneath that , parents ' names .. . grade the child attended at the Low Gap School . . . home address . " The one named Bessie shook her head . " I vow and declare , Teacher  --  that home address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye 're a-meanin ' by that home address ? ' " " Where they live . For reports and notices and so on , " I explainedpatiently . " We have to know that . " " Jest ca n't mortally  --  " Ruby Mae looked as puzzled as the others . " Tell you what . Let 's each take a row . You watch me with the first name and then you 'll understand perfectly . " All of the pupils in my row were boys . The first one looked to be about a second-grader , flaxen-haired , with eyes that looked at me directly as he spoke and the firmest mouth I had ever seen on a youngster . My notebook was ready . " Now  --  your name ? " " Front name or back name ? " " Well  --  er  --  both . " " Front name be Sam Houston . " Long pause . " A fine name , " I prodded . " A Tennessee hero . He picked up where Davy Crockett left off , did n't he ? Was Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no blood kin . " 72 " Well now , your  --  what did you call it  --  back name ? " " Holcombe . " " Oh , yes . Of course , now I remember . That was your fatherwho helped us this morning . Now , what 's his full name ? " " He be John Swanson Holcombe . " " And your mother 's name ? " " She 's just Mama . " " But she has a name . What 's her name ? " " Wimmin folks call her Lizzie . ' " " But her real name ? " I persisted . The small brow wrinkled . " Let me study on hit now . Oh , shorely . Now I know . Elizabeth Teague Holcombe , " he intoned triumphantly . I glanced over at my helpers standing at the head of their rows watching me . Their faces wore a quizzical expression that seemed to say . " Uh-huh , you see , not quite as easy as you thought . " But Sam Houston Holcombe and I pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine years old . He had never before been to school . There were five other children in the family . His " Paw and Mama were all-fired tickled pink ' bout this school a-startin ' . " " Last question , Sam  --  " " Generally go by Sam Houston , Teacher . " " Of course . I beg your pardon  --  And now your address ? Tell me where you live . " " Wal  --  " That puzzled look on the small face again . " First ye cross Cutter Branch . Then ye cut acrost Lonesome Pine Ridge and down . Through the Gap 's the best way . At the third fork in the trail , ye scoot under the fence and head for PigeonroostHollow . Then ye spy our cabin and pull into our place , ' bout two mile or so from the Spencers . Acutely conscious of the three girls watching me , I scribbled something that made no sense even to me except that the Spencersseemed to be the nearest neighbors to the Holcombes . ObviouslyI was going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cutter Gap . I nodded to my three helpers and they started down their73rows as I went on with mine . My second boy had pathetically crossed eyes . " Your name ? " " Orter . " " Full name , Orter ? " " Name 's Orter Ball O'Teale . " " Age ? " " Eleven year old a-goin ' on twelve . " His address turned out to be easier because his family lived just down the road from the mission house . Although this was turning out to be a somewhat unconventionalroll , it was valuable to me because the children volunteeredall sorts of information on the side . John Spencer , fifteen , had a battered plane geometry book on his desk . " Teacher , I worked these figgers  --  " " You mean you 've done the problems ? " " Yes 'm . " " All of them ? All the way through the book ? " " Yes 'm , mighty near . Could you git me a harder book ? " " I 'll surely try . May have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you kindly for that . " " John , have you always been so good at math ? " " Yes 'm . Plumb crazy about workin ' figgers . Not a solitary thing I like better . " " Well , that 's great , " I said looking at him with new interest . " Do n't aim to take no big-head ' bout it with the other young'uns though , " he added quickly . That brought me to a boy who said that his name was ZachariasJehoshaphat Holt  --  to snickers all around him . The boy immediately behind him said softly , " Plumb crazy . Ai n't yer name a-tall . " " This is n't the time for fooling , " I said . " We 're trying to get the roll down . Now tell me your real name . " " Zacharias Jehoshaphat  --  " With that his right ear jerked violently . Now the children laughed uproariously , some of them doubledover  --  all but the boy who had spoken up . He kept a straight face as he volunteered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He be a-packin ' lies . You can tell . Jest look at his ear . " 74Sure enough , Zacharias ' ear jerked again . " Certainly , I see his car , " I said . " But what 's that got to do with not telling the truth ? " " Oh ma'am ! All them Holts when they tell a whopper , their cars twitch  --  " I ignored this and turned again to the boy in front . " Tell me your name , " I tried again . " Zacharias  --  " He snickered  --  and swallowed . " Jehosha-pllat  --  " Once again , the ear wiggled . But now I saw it  --  a string over the ear . Slightly unnerved , I reached over to remove the cord . But the boy in back jerked it away from me and stuffed the string in his desk . Incensed , I marched to the desk and reached in , only to have my fingers meet a mass of wriggling fur . As I squealed and stepped backwards , a small animal as frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A ring-tailed raccoon sat there looking at me from behind his funny mask of a face , one end of the cord held fast in his mouth . Then he took one paw ( so like a small hand ) and delicately extracted the string from his teeth and began trilling and scolding at me , as if he were the teacher and I the naughty pupil . Naturally my schoolroom was by this time a bedlam , the girls giggling , the boys holding their middles and laughing so hard that one of them got the hiccoughs . But the boy on whose desk he coon sat held a straight face . He seemed a reincarnation ofhat Tom Sawyer should have looked like : overalls . . . bare fret . . . tousled hair . . . lots of freckles . . . two front teeth missing . It was his too-straight face that tipped me off . He had master-minded the whole thing , I suspected . " Now  --  let 's begin all over , " I said to the boy in front . I was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this much trouble just getting a few names on paper ! " Creed thar put me up to it , " the small thumb jerked toward the Tom Sawyer character behind him . " Said if'n I 'd do hit , he 'd let me sleep his coon for one night . " Meanwhile the boy in back was whistling softly . " I see . " I could wait no longer for identification of the whistler . " What 's your name ? Creed what ? " 75 " Creed Josiah Allen , " he smirked . " This is your raccoon , Creed ? " " Yes 'm . Pet coon , Scalawag . ' " " Might be a good name for you too . You 're a scalawag . Now stop whistling and  --  " " Jest whistlin ' a catch  --  " " Never mind that . Cut it out , " I said severely , " and we 'll talk about you and the matter of a pet in school in a minute . " Then I returned to the boy in front . " Name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Front name be Zacharias . Fer a fact , Teacher . Ye can jest call me Zach . That Jehoshaphat ' now . That was made up . Back name be Holt . Six of us Holts in school . " I learned that Rebecca and Ozias Holt had eight children , four of them boys . The oldest , Wraight , was seventeen . He had been one of the pupils Mr. Grantland had been watching , the one with the cunning look . The Holt cabin was somewhere southeast of the mission on the slopes of Runyon Rowe Mountain . The directions for getting there took an entire paragraph . That brought me back to Creed whose eyes glittered with  --  was it intelligence or mischief ? Perhaps both . Quickly I decided that I 'd better try to make friends this first morning . " How old is Scalawag , Creed ? " " Got him from a kit last summer . " " What 's a kit ? " " Like a nest . Where other young'uns are . He 's most grown now . Sleeps with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he added defensively , " Oh , he be clean . Coons wash every naturalblessed thing afore they eat hit . " " I 've heard that . " " Coons are the main best pets in the world , " he confided . " If ye 'd like one fer yerself , Teacher , come spring , maybe we'uns could spy out a kit and git one for ye . " " Uh  --  thanks , Creed . Thanks so much . It 's very nice of you . Well , tell you what , let me think about that offer . Now  --  about Scalawag and school  --  " " Oh , Scalawag wo n't cause no trouble . Cross my heart and hope to die . " 76What could I say without caving in this friendship before it got started ? Suddenly I had an inspiration . " It 's like this , Creed , " I lowered my voice . " This is just between you and me . Promise you wo n't tell . " " Cross my heart . " His face was rapt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I can see that already  --  youknow , so good-looking and such a little comic actor , that the children will want to watch him instead of doing their lessons . " " Land , no , Teacher . " Creed 's look said that this conversation was not going the way he had hoped and that he was ready to do battle for his pet . " We 'll study on , study on , better'n ever . " I leaned even closer . " Let 's make a pact . You leave Scalawag borne after this , then I 'll let you bring him to the last social , the big recitation just before school closes . We 'll fix it so thatalawag will be part of the entertainment . " " Honest , Teacher ! " His face was shining . " That be a sealed rgain , fair and square . Land o ' livin ' ! Why then pretty nigh crybody in the Covell see Scalawag . Put it thar , Teacher ! " c stuck out a grubby hand . So , feeling rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sis , I went on down the row : Joshua Bean Beck . . . and one c-re O'Teale : Smith , age fifteen , and then two empty seats . The st note I had made for each boy was what school supplies and - oks he had . Only there was pathetically little to put down , no ( Rebooks , little paper of any kind . Obviously the matter of books and supplies was urgent , yet the parents of these pupils could contribute almost nothing . 1 was going to have to make an immediate survey of the schoolbooksavailable . The day before , David Grantland had carried over to the school all textbooks that the mission owned . There were so few it was scarcely believable ! And these were tattered , h pages missing and torn , most with no covers . Among the boys in my row , I had seen on desks one wornof Red Riding Hood , one Fowler 's Arithmetic , a Jack andBeanstalk , and a Smith 's Primary Grammar . I thought offather 's library at home  --  books floor-to-ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calf , embossed and77tooled in gold . How odd life is , I could not help thinking . Why are things so disproportionate ? Why do some people have so much and others so little ? AS THE MORNING went on , I had a growing uneasiness about the big swarthy boy in the back row . Ruby Mae had put his name down as Lundy Taylor and his father as Bird's-Eye Taylor . Perhaps Mr. Grantland 's covert watching of several of these boys had alarmed me unnecessarily , but I noticed that the Taylor boy was uncooperative , never joined in the singing , never took part in anything . Resentment of some sort smoldered in him . Already , he seemed to dislike me . I forced myself not to keep looking at him . On the other hand , there were those children who were particularlybright and appealing  --  like Vella , the little sister of Zacharias ( ear-twitching ) Holt . The tiny girl with auburn pigtailswas only five , straight brows over mahogany-colored eyes looked at me with a direct level gaze . Her nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below that , a pale rosebud of a mouth with almost no lower lip . All morning long she stared at me with those so-brown eyes ; ever so often she would yawn , the eyes big and round and never wavering during the yawn . Then there was Little Burl . Twice during the morning he slipped up to my desk to reach out admiring grimy fingers and touch the embroidery on my shirtwaist . " Teacher , hit 's a wonderysight to be-hold . " On his second trip he entreated , " Teacher , when will ye set up and sup with us ? Our house is over furrenist the crik , over the ridge and down . Ye can cut through the nigh way . " " Of course I 'll come . Little Burl , how is your father ? " " Oh , Paw 's head be mendin ' fine now . Doc MacNeill shore fixed it good . If'n yell come and sup , I 'll ask my Mama to make ye a Scripture cake . " The blue , blue eyes were pleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I will come soon . That 's a promise . " All morning I was conscious of the constant roar of the fire in the stove . Much too hot close to it , with the rest of the room78always uncomfortably cold . There were the dripping noses , no handkerchiefs at all ; the shining eager faces during the spelling bee ; the lilt of the voices . What was it , I wondered , that gave the voices that musical quality , that rhythm ? " Teacher , everwhoseen such pretty wearin ' - clothes as yours ! " . . . " If happenyou pass " . . . " I wonder me if " . . . " Tuesday , ' t was a week ago " . . . " Teacher , be ye sorry at our meanness ? " . . . Where , I asked myself , do I begin to correct English ? How can I unravel bad grammar from picturesque traditional idiom that it would be a shame to change . . . " I hope , Teacher , it wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day long you 're makin ' this a thronged day . " Next in that " thronged day " came noon recess , which the children called " the dinner spell . " Even before they opened their dinner pails , some of the children organized a singing game . Their voices were high and sweet in the crisp cold air : " I Jere come five dukes , a-rovin ' , a-rovin ' , a-rovin ' I Icre come five dukes a-rovin ' , with a heigh a-ransomtee . We 're quite as good as you sires , one of us , sires , one of us sires , Pray will you have one of us sires , with a heigh a-ransomtee . The song sounded so British . " Dukes " and " sires " in these isolated mountains ! After I had eaten the basket dinner that Miss Ida had prepared for me , I stood in the doorway watching the children . I was aware of a kaleidoscope of impressions : the oak-split baskets or lard buckets with large soda biscuits , sometimes with a slice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bread ; cold roasted sweet potatoes which the children peeled and ate like bananas ; corn bread , big hunks of it ; an occasional apple . Very few children had milk . Those who did not , went trick and forth to the cedar water bucket in the back of the room , everyone drinking from the same gourd . I made a mentalnote that I was going to have to put a stop to that . The communalgourd would be a good way to start epidemics . What we needed was a supply of those new paper cups just on the market called " Health Kups . " I had seen some of them in Asheville. 79But if they were too expensive , perhaps I could teach the children to make folding cups out of glossy paper . I left my post at the door and began a list on a scrap of paper on my desk : Solve matter of communal bucket . Health Kups ? Books : Write father . Are there books from our library which the children could use ? Give him list of possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Silver SkatesHuckleberry FinnA Tale of Two CitiesWrite our minister 's wife in Asheville . Perhaps ladies ' societies would help us buy textbooks . Write report to Dr. Ferrand of first day 's school and desperate need of books . Think through need of warm clothes , especially shoes for the children . Would church at home help there too ? Handkerchiefs ? Perhaps a pile of clean rags each morning on my desk . Saw suggestion of tobacco juice stains on outside of new building . Could any of the boys be chewing ? Track this one down . Problem : How to go about grading the school ? Problem : Is sex segregation good or bad ? Think through . And that other matter  --  the constant tittering and the giggling . I had not been able to stop it all day and it bothered me . Was it that the children were so excited over this first day of school and the new building with its shining windows of real glass and their new teacher who had been " brought on " and Creed 's pet raccoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong places at moments which were meant to be serious was making me increasingly self-conscious . What was I doing wrong ? The background hum of the high-pitched voices outside was shattered by a screech of pain and then violent crying . I ran out to find tiny Vella Holt crumpled up on the ground , sobbing , with the other children gathering in a circle around her. 8o " IIas a pump knot on her head , " a voice volunteered as I took the child in my arms . The little girl did have a large bump . It was going to be a nasty bruise . What was worse , the blow had been dangerously dose to the side of her temple . " What happened ? " I asked . No one answered . I looked up . The circle of faces looked too grave for children 's faces , too noncommittal . " Someone has to tell me , " I persisted . " Did Vella fall down ? " " No 'm , " a girl 's voice said softly . " She got hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust a homemade ball into my hands . It was so much heavier than I expected that I almost dropped it . The ball appeared to be made of strips of old cloth wound round and round and then bound with thread . But when I pushed a thumb through the cloth , I found a rock at the center . " Vella got hit with this ? No wonder she has a bump on her head ! Who threw this ? " Again , the silence . Then out of the corner of my eye I caught a movement . I turned my head to see Lundy Taylor and Smith ( ) " I'cale slinking into the empty schoolhouse . " I ) id Lundy or Smith throw this ? " The children answered not a word but their eyes told me the truth . I felt chilled and frightened . Could either boy have done such a thing on purpose ? As we comforted Vella and put cloths wrung out of fresh snow on her " pump knot , " my mind struggled with the problem . I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after school and ask Mr. Grantland to help me get to the bottom of the mischief , rather than talk to them before all the other pul-ils . From then on , the day did not go too well . For one thing , alreadyI had used up all my lesson plans for the day and I was running out of ideas . Surely one of the chief differences between the veteran teacher and the recruit must be that the experienced can never find enough time , whereas the ingenue struggles to fill the hours , looks forward to dismissal time as a reprieve . I told myself that the real problem was no books ; textbooks would make all the difference . Of course they would . How could any-81one teach without books ? Only twelve-thirty . It had to be later than that . Perhaps I was not cut out to be a teacher after all . I was grateful that Mr. Grantland would be helping me in the afternoon . What subjects had we not touched on today ? Penmanship . Happy thought ! I was proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always flattered myself . I would enjoy putting some sentences on the blackboard to be copied for penmanship . About halfway across the floor , I almost stepped on several marbles . Automatically , I stopped to pick them up . But at that moment a child hurled himself toward me almost in a flying tackle . " Teacher , do n't touch them . " It was Little Burl hanging onto my arm , shrieking at me . I was startled at his ferocity . " Why not ? I ca n't leave them on the floor , someone will step on them and go scooting . " The little boy looked at me , his face flushed and contorted , his cowlick jerking . " Teacher , them thar marbles are hot , they 'll burn ye . " " Hot ? " I still did n't understand . Some of the pupils looked embarrassed . Obviously there was something Little Burl did not know how to explain . In the back of the room the laughter started again . It seemed to be led by Wraight Holt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Lundy babbling in idiotic fashion , " He ! He ! Hot marbles ! " Finally it was John Spencer who spoke up . " Teacher , I 'd thank ye to let me pick up the marbles for you . Little Burl was afeared you 'd burn your fingers . He 's right , them marbles are red hot . " " How did they get so hot ? " " They was put in the stove , ma'am . " " You  --  did you  --  ? " " No ma'am , not me . Guess it was just foolery . " Calmly John took a rag from his pocket , gingerly picked up the marbles one by one and then left them on the rag on my desk . This whole episode struck me as a low-down prank , ingenious  --  but mean , almost as bad as the one on the playground . " Look , a prank 's a prank , " I heard myself saying to the roomful of chil- 8zdren . " But this was n't funny . There are tiny children in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red hot marbles with bare feet ? They 'd have gotten badly burned . You see , glass holds heat  --  " " It sure does ! " a self-assured masculine voice said from the doorway . " And your Teacher 's right , " Mr. Grantland was speaking as he strode toward my desk . For me , his presence filled the room . Suddenly I realized how drained I was ; the marble trick had been one too many . " And this is n't the kind of prank we 're going to put up with here . " He was by my side protectingly . " Recess time for you , Teacher , " he said quietly and I looked at him gratefully . As I turned to go , I heard him say , " Girls and boys , I have here a letter from Dr. Ferrand for the opening of school . I thought you 'd like to hear it . " SevenI I IAD BEEN teaching school for almost a month . It seemedso much longer . Was it only four weeks ago that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new life ? Why , y life in Asheville seemed so far away that it could have been onths or years . After the first couple of weeks in Cutter Gap lien I knew my way around some , I had thought that everyingwould get easier . How wrong I was ! Instead , my troubles ere multiplying faster than the freckles on Ruby Mae 's face . For one thing , neither Lundy Taylor nor Smith O'Teale had dinitted throwing the ball-rock at little Vella . Not even David rantland had been able to penetrate Lundy 's wall of surliness , ml Smith  --  frightened of something  --  would not talk at all . Nor was I making any progress with what I had supposedwould be accomplished by the first or second week : dividing the pool into proper grades . In order to handle so many children , I  --  ded to seat the pupils of each grade together  --  regardless of . Yet over and over I was told , " No 'm , I ca n't sit by no boy . t is ai n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if'n ye make83it a courtin ' school . " None of the children would budge from this attitude . They were equally immovable on their insistence on Latin , Latin , and more Latin when what they really needed were the most elementary of subjects . It seemed that from the Old Countryhad come the conviction that any boy or girl without Latin " did n't have no l'arnin ' a-tall . " " Do n't hanker for fancy doings and foolishness in the school , " parents told me , " but do n't you let my young'uns go till they can read Latin real good . " Or " Do n't mean to be onery , but my mind 's sot and I 'm that long-headed ' bout Latin . " They were too  --  long-headed stubborn Scots with a sprinkling of equally flinty Irish and German . In taking this job I had supposed that a year and a half of Junior College on top of High School would enable me to teach ordinary subjects in a oneroomcountry schoolhouse . But I had not counted on having to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were various behavior problems  --  like the tobacco chewer who was depositing amber spittle on the freshly painted outside walls of the schoolhouse . And some crude obscene drawings had appeared on the walls of the privies . Increasingly , evidence pointed to three boys as our chief troublemakers : Lundy Taylor , Wraight Holt and Smith O'Teale , with Rorex Beck sometimes joining in the mischief . Then there were children who were not alert because they were not eating properly , were actually hungry , I suspected . And there were several with eye problems . I would see them shielding their bloodshot eyes from the light ; on sunshiny days they would sometimes slip beneath their desks to get into a shadow . Nor could I ever have anticipated the pigs  --  what the children called " hawgs . " In the Cove most hogs were not penned , sothey wandered at will , fattening themselves on " mast "  --  beech- acorns , and chestnuts . Some of them had taken to sleepingunder the schoolhouse floor , grunting with what must surely be the most repulsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation posts . The pig noises did not help a bit with the effort to teach seventy-two classes in six hours : that was , for84three days of the week , six subjects in all twelve grades ; for the other two days when Bible was added , eighty-four classes . Of course it was impossible ! After any such day I desperately needed some time to myself to take my mind off pigs and Latin and get back some perspective . But in the mission house privacy was as hard to come by as four-leaf clovers in a patch of dandelions  --  chiefly because Ruby Mae Morrison was always appearing at my bedroom door . In Ruby Mae I had an unsought protegee . She stared at me , questioned me , talked ceaselessly while she wonderingly fingered my possessions . Or if I fled from my room to escape her , she would trail me around the house and grounds like a devoted collie dog . Since Ruby Mae wanted to be with me that much , I tried enlisting her help in running errands , like spying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen . Then I would rush clown to wash my clothes . Otherwise , Miss Ida would stand there as I worked , gazing at me steadily with pursed lips , rubbing her thumbs against her fingers , disapproval shrieking from her cold silence . I could never seem to do anything to please her . Of course Miss Ida was just Miss Ida , often irascible , as I knew now , a stickler of a housekeeper and always clutching of her brother David . Mr. Grantland did not take his sister too seriously , and neither should I , he told me . In fact , David Grantlandwas a support to me in all of these troublesome matters  --  in school and out  --  because his light approach helped me ward off self-pity and hang onto my sense of humor . It was he who had explained to me that first day of school when I had been so bothered by the children 's giggling every time I opened my mouth , " Do n't worry . It 's nothing . Your way of speaking , the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is , to the pupils as their way of speakingsounds odd to you . You 'll get used to one another . " He had been right . Within the week the snickering was tapering off . And he was soon telling me , " Look Christy , enough of this Mr. Grantland . ' Makes me feel like your father . " I blushed ridiculously . " You do n't seem a bit like my fa-ther  --  " 85 " Then make it David . ' " " But not before the children . " " No , not before them , but everywhere else  --  " So it was agreed . As I got to know David better , I found that he was a tease with a tongueful of banter on any subject  --  even those I took most seriously . Like that Tuesday night at the supper table when , having added the last name to the school roll that day , I admitted my discouragement . " Just imagine it ! A grand total of sixty-seven pupils in one room ! That 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grades . " " Well , my offer still stands , " David told me as he helped himself to more corn pudding and reached for another hot biscuit . " Which was  --  ? " " Which was to take over the Bible classes on top of all the mathematics classes . " " Does that include Bible memory work ? " " Yes  --  and I 'll even go you one better , " he added impulsively . " If you like , I 'll take one or more of your advanced Latin classes . And there you have a magnificent offer . Before I could answer , Miss Alice put in , " It really is a good offer , Christy , with all David has to do . " " That 's right ! " David continued . " And if you think you have it bad , look at me ! I must call on a minimum of sixty families each month . Dr. Ferrand 's orders . Build schoolhouse-churches , barns , springhouses , roads . Write sermons and preach , organize Sunday schools . Set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesome fun going for the young folks . Shall I go on ? " " No need . I 'm impressed , " I told him . And I really was . He and Miss Alice were each doing the work of several people . But then I asked , " Where 's the barn you built ? " " Afraid you 'd ask about that . " He leaned close to me , a wide smile lighting his features . " No barn . Just thought I 'd try tossingthat in for effect . Now  --  do you want my help  --  or do n't you ? " " As my students would say , I do ! And thank you kindly . ' " But even with David 's help and his jocular attitude , whenever I could be by myself of a night after Ruby Mae had gone to bed , 86I felt that I had to face the sober facts : the school was too much for as inexperienced a teacher as I was . All the doubts I had had that day of Bob Allen 's accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my motives in coming to Cutter Gap , returned in full force . It was not that I was superstitious about Mr. Allen 's accident . He was recovering nicely . But perhaps , I reasoned , the accident had nonetheless been one of many signpoststrying to tell me that I had made a mistake , pointing me back to my world where I belonged . ONE AFTERNOON after an especially exhausting day in school , I thought that a walk would clear my head . So I slipped out the side door of the mission house , for once evading Ruby Mae . The air was cold , still with the tangy crispness of winter . Gratefully I drew deep draughts of it into my lungs . The snow which had covered all of East Tennessee on January znd had still not melted here in the mountains . Snow never lasted so long in Asheville , and by the second day it was always dirty from soot and traffic . I never knew that snow could be so beautiful until I saw it miles away from a city . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the road there were some dark blobs scattered over several yards , marring the whiteness . As I got closer , I saw that the blobs were torn fur  --  some black , some reddish-brown with  --  Oh , no ! Some poor little rabbit had been caught by another animal and literally torn to bits . On the crust of the snow there were blood stains and bits of torn fur clinging to bloody viscera . I did not want to see any more , so I skirted the spot and walked on rapidly down the road . I wished that my mind were a slate so that with one swipe I could wipe off what I had just seen . Instead , a train of kindred memories came rushing in . Like that time when I had seen a tomcat streaking across our lawn in Asheville with a baby squirrelin his mouth , the squirrel crying in pathetic , high-pitched squeals of animal terror . I had dashed after the tomcat but he had been too quick for me . Sadly , I had turned back towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in87my ears . Why did nature have such a vicious , tooth-and-claw aspect ? Or that time when I had been playing hide-and-seek with playmates and had stepped on the body of a dead bird in the boxwood serpentine of the yard next door . Right now , so many years later , the nerves up my back crawled at the thought . I remember that I had refused to look while mother had slipped off my shoe and cleaned it . And after that , I had never wanted to wear that pair of shoes again . I jerked my mind back . I 'll think of other things . I was passingthe O'Teale 's tobacco barn , so their cabin must be somewherenear . There were four of the O'Teale children in my school and since I was in no mood to pay a call , I knew I 'd better turn around and start back . But it was too late . Suddenly , I was at the edge of their yard and Mrs. O'Teale had seen me . She put her hand to her mouth and hallooed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like all the others I had seen , except more unkempt . In the yard , the trampled-down snow was littered with trash  --  rags and papers and junk , with pigs and chickenswandering at will . There was the usual big black pot turned on its side , rusting . No effort had been made to stack the firewood ; the logs lay in wild disarray where they had been tossed . But in the midst of the squalor were the usual clumps of old English boxwood , snow-capped , incongruous in this setting . I paused at the edge of the yard as I saw that the debris was worse than it had looked from a distance . There was filth , humanfilth along with the animal . The chickens were pecking at it ; the pigs were walking through it , rolling in it , grunting . I lifted my skirts , and with my eyes on the ground for each step ahead , picked my way across the yard . Is n't there an outhouse in the back yard ? Are n't they teaching the children anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my walk from the mission house in the opposite direction . Mrs. O'Teale ( whose first name , Swannie , did not seem to suit her at all ) was delighted to see me , obviously flattered by what she thought a deliberate visit from the new teacher . She was a tall slender woman with stringy , dirty-looking blonde hair . She was wearing a faded calico shirtwaist and an ill-fitting skirt88with an apron on top of it . Her shoulders sagged , as if for a long time they had been carrying too heavy a load . Her eyes were dull and tired and sad , beaten by life . In the next few moments l saw why . " Come in and set , " she said warmly as we went inside . As soon as my eyes adjusted to the dim light , I was puzzled to see a penned-off area across the opposite corner of the room , looking as if they kept some pet animal there . Then the back door slammed , and a boy in his teens , big and hulking , shuffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vacant eyes . he wore no pants , only a tattered sweater that came over his thighs , almost to his knees . I could tell that he had nothing on under the sweater . His dark hair was long and matted , though it looked as if it had been whacked off by someone months before ; his face was smudged with dirt . Saliva drooled from the corners of his mouth and trickled through the grime on his chin . Since he was still staring at me , I said weakly , " Ah  --  hello . " He made no answer , just stood there . Empty desolation looked out of his eyes . And the stench , the terrible stench . . . How could two women " visit " in a situation like this ? " That thar 's Wilmer , my first-born , " Mrs. O'Teale said as matter-of-factly as if she saw nothing wrong . The boy pointed to a tin plate of cold corn bread on the table . " Unh  --  Um-humh . Ah-h-mm . Oo  --  anh . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She thrust the plate into his hands . He crammed a fistful of corn bread into his mouth . I could not look . Should I ignore the boy and talk about the other O'Teale children in my school ? Or should I pretend that there was nothing wrong with this boy ? ( I had heard at the mission that he had been born half-witted and was also subject to frequentepileptic fits . ) But would it not be better to admit the reality and be sympathetic ? His mother decided for me . " Wal now , that should keep Wilmer from starvin '  --  And how are my young'uns doin ' ? In the school , I mean ? " " It 's probably a little too soon to tell , " I hedged . " It takes a while , you know , for pupils to get accustomed to a new teacher . " 89 " Aye . Some teachers from the level lands has had theirselves a time . Recollect one that did n't stay no time a-tall . Left sayin ' she were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her school , flashin ' them at her . " There was a loud clatter and I jumped . Wilmer had finished the corn bread and dropped the tin plate . He pointed to it , rollingacross the floor , and bared his teeth in a caricature of a grin . " He ! He  --  Mm  --  oo ! Unh , he ! " Saliva poured down his chin . I was revolted and then ashamed of my revulsion . I looked away , only to have the boy shuffle into my line of vision as he crossed the room to a pile of glistening rocks and pieces of metal and glass inside the pen . Mrs. O'Teale 's eyes followed mine . " ' Course sometimes Wilmertakes a notion to run off a piece . Do n't know himself where he be . Then we'uns have a time findin ' him . Do n't want him to git ahold of a rifle-gun or fall off-n the moun-tain  --  er nothin ' . So when he takes fits like that , we fence him in . " Animal grunts came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor playing with his rocks . I decided to risk one question . " Has he always been like this , Mrs. O'Teale ? " " Yes 'm . Since he was birthed , that is . But he 's a good boy . Never gives me no trouble . " There was a long silence . I could not sort out my feelings and swallowed back a nauseous lump in my throat . What ultimate tragedy , to have brought a son like this into the world ! But Mrs. O'Teale gave no indication that she felt any tragedy . Compassion for her and for her boy rose in me . Yet I dared not express it for there was the strange feeling that if I did , she would look at me blankly and wonder why I felt sorry or embarrassed for her . Perhaps , I thought wildly , since she must live with this , she was better off with the insensibility . The room was dark now and there seemed nothing more to say . " I must be going , " I said as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Smith and Orter and Mountie and  --  " Suddenly I was aware again of the dreadful odor from the corner and my mind went blank . I could n't remember the names of the other two O'Teales . " By the way , where are all the children ? " 90 " Went a-visitin ' to my sister 's . They 'll be a-comin ' back most anytime now . Here  --  let me light the lamp so 's ye can see where vc 're goin ' . Real neighborly of you to come and say howdy to us . " I want to help however I can , " I told her as I went down the steps . " Next time I 'll be able to tell you more about the schoolwork . " But if only I had real answers to give this O'Teale family . The minute I was out of sight of the cabin , I lifted my skirts and ran wildly down the road , making a wide detour of the dead rabbit . At the mission house , I dashed up the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , brushed my long hair by a wide open window so that the clean mountain air could pour through it . Then I washed my face , first in warm water , then in cold , scrubbed my hands over and over and over . Like Lady Macbeth , I thought ruefully . . . But I could not scrub my memory , nor rub out what I had seen . Miss Ida 's piercing voice came up the stairwell , " Miss Huddleston  --  supper'son . " And a few minutes later she was serving us salmon croquettes and hash-browned potatoes . There was nothing wrong with Miss Ida 's cooking . Any other time I would . be enjoying this food , but tonight my stomach was churning . Now Miss Ida was bringing in a bowl of cooked apples . I swallowed , took a deep breath in an effort to get my unruly stomach under control . Mind over matter . Any thought will do . David 's sister is not a pretty one . She knows that . Maybe that 's why she 's so cranky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant , Miss Ida passed the apples over my shoulder and the steam from the bowl wafted close to my nose . Through a haze I saw Miss Alice looking at me questioningly . I swallowed again . It was no use . I managed to blurt out , " Excuse me  --  " as I fled toward the yard . Moments later I felt Miss Alice 's firm cool hands , one hand on my forehead , the other on the back of my head . " Go ahead , Christy . Get rid of everything . Thee will feel better now . " " I  --  have n't been so sick since . . . " " No , do n't try to talk . " The strong hands supported my head . Finally it was over. 91Miss Alice asked , " Just one question , where were you this afternoon ? " " O'Teales . " Even to me , my voice sounded weak and far away . " Oh  --  I see . No wonder . That 's the worst place of all . " Later on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was propped up in bed working on lessons , but my mind was not really on what I was doing . So many questions and thoughts were tumbling over themselves inside me . There was the need to spill them out to someone . Miss Alice must have known that . She had no sooner sat down on the edge of the bed than I started . " Father was right , " I blurted out . " Even the old train conductor and Mrs. Tatum were right . I was n't willing to listen , that 's all . I do n't belong here . I 'm going back home . Miss Alice , I 'm sorry about the children and all . " Then I started crying . " It 's no use , just no use . " Miss Alice let me sob , talk , rave on and on , patted me now and then . She made no protest when I told her that I was going to leave , offered no arguments why I should go or stay , asked no questions , never even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end , her silence was more eloquent than any words . At last I lifted my head , tossed my tousled hair out of my wet eyes to look at the serene woman sitting so erectly on the edge of my bed . Suddenly I needed to know what she was thinking . The gray eyes looked back calmly , unblinkingly for long minutes . Depths of quietness , wells of thoughts seemed to lie behindthose eyes . Still she said nothing . " Am I wrong to feel this way ? " I asked , suddenly unsure of myself . " Any sensitive person would feel exactly as thee feels . " The voice was crisp , matter-of-fact . That odd habit of hers of lapsing into her Quaker " thee " at tender moments . Yet she was n't a bit consistent about it . " Maybe it 's just as well this happened , " she went on . " Now is as good a time as any to decide whether you 'll go home or not  --  provided you make your decision on a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true basis ? " " The way life really is . " " Not much of life can be as bad as what I saw this afternoon . " My words had rebellion in them , I knew they did . " You 'd be surprised . Every bit of life , every single one of us has a dark side , " she retorted . " When you decided to leave home and take this teaching job , you were venturing out of your particularivory tower . I know . I was reared in an ivory tower too . Then we get our first good look at the way life really is , and a lot of us want to run back to shelter in a hurry . " " You ? Did you ever want to run back ? " Her reply was a chuckle so soft that it was almost a sigh . " I ? Yes , certainly . I 'm a classic example . At age sixteen I had , shall we say , a difficult experience , so difficult that after that I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood  --  or disease  --  or cruelty  --  orwhoring  --  or death . Ever since God has been gently , steadily , prying the little girl 's hand off the little girl 's eyes . " " How ? How did He pry your hands ? " " Through circumstances . Through plunging me over and over into situations where I had to look . .. had to see real-ity . " " Bad circumstances ? Really bad ? " " Really had . " There was no mistaking the quiet emphasis of the words . My eyes searched Miss Alice 's face in an effort to read everything there . " But how could it have been that bad ? " I probed . " I ca n't see that you 've been scarred by any of it  --  or coarsened . " A variety of thoughts were mirrored in her smile , a slow smile with sadness in it . " Yes , really had , " she repeated thoughtfully . " Like the crippled nine-year-old girl who was beaten over and over by her mother 's lover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same man . The child died the next day . " I hoped she would not give any more details . My horror must have shown . But Miss Alice took no notice . " Or there was the day I walked into a cabin over on Hog Back Mountain and discovered a woman strung up from the rafters  --  swinging  --  dead . Her imbecile husband was there gaping at the body . He was the murderer . When I asked him why he had93done it , his only explanation was , A woman what ca n't stand hangin ' a few hours ai n't no woman a-tall . ' Then there was  --  " " Please , " I interrupted desperately . " I do n't want to hear any more . Miss Alice looked at me curiously . " You 're sensitive , Christy . So am I. You want to know why seeing stark evil has n't made me rough or bitter ? " She seemed to be seeing into her past . Then she took a deep breath , plunged on . " Remember , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hands off her eyes . As if He were saying , I ca n't use ivory-tower followers . They 're plaster of paris , they crumble and fall apart in life 's press . So you 've got to see life the way it really is before you can do anything about evil . You can not vanquish it . I can . But in My world the battle against evil has to be a joint endeavor . You and Me . I , God , in you , can have the victory every time . ' After that , He was always right there beside me , looking at the dreadful sights with compassionand love and heartbreak . His caring and His love were too real for bitterness to grow in me . " " Then if God was standing right there , looking and caring , why did n't He stop things like that ? " The bitter question clawed at my throat . " A Supreme Being with real power and real love would n't stand by and watch a little girl raped and a woman hanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , if He 'd given us men and women a genuinefreedom of choice . " Miss Alice 's voice was gentle . " I think it 's like this . . . The Creator made the world a cooperative enterprise . In order for it to be that way , God had to give us the privilege of going His way or of refusing to go His way . " " But how ? How do we go His way ? " " He 's specific about that . " She ticked the points off on her fingers : " Love ye your enemies ' . . . Do good ' . . . Be ye therefore merciful ' . . . Judge not ' . . . Forgive ' . . . And best of all , Give , and it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over shall men give into your bosom . ' A great promise to claim ! " " What do you mean by claim ' ? " The Quaker lady was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not so much thinking as listening . Then she94aid , " You 've heard of staking a claim ' in the old frontier days ? " " Yes . " " There was lots of rich land available back then . But in order to get any for himself , each man had to move out and claim what he wanted . If he did n't make that move , then for him nothing happened . " This is n't a perfect analogy , but perhaps it will help to explain . . . God has all kinds of riches for all of us . Not just spiritual riches either . His promises in the Bible are His way of telling us what 's available . But this plenty does n't become ours until we drive in our stake on a particular promise and thus indicatethat we accept that gift . That , Christy , is claiming . ' " " This is all new to me , " I told her . " I like it . " A wonderful smile lighted her face . Then quickly she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago about running hack to our ivory tower . You see , Christy , evil is real  --  and powerful . It has to be fought , not explained away , not fled . And God is against evil all the way . So each of us has to decide where we stand , how we 're going to live our lives . We can try to persuade ourselves that evil does n't exist ; live for ourselves and wink at evil . We can say that it is n't so bad after all , maybe even try to call it fun by clothing it in silks and velvets . We can compromisewith it , keep quiet about it and say it 's none of our business . Or we can work on God 's side , listen for His orders on strategy against the evil , no matter how horrible it is , and know that He can transform it . " The words poured over me . Desperately I wanted to understand . I knew that we were on the track of one of those big question marks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl  --  ? " I asked softly . " The answer is n't easy . I doubt that with the limitations of our humanness we can ever fully understand . But in that particularcase , I think the little girl was raped because the person appointed to reach her in time to prevent the murder refused to hear  --  or to obey . I happen to know that a certain man for two days disregarded a strong inner impulse to go to her . Finally he ( lid go , but it was too late . So God 's clear order went unheeded. 95And evil had its day . The result of our disobedience can be that simple , that terrible . " I sat , trying to take this in , thinking it over for a long mo- ment . . . The words rang in my mind : That simple . . . that terrible . But that does n't explain Wilmer . . . not even the little rabbit that never had a chance . " Christy , you have questions on your mind . I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than others . But if we 're going to work on God 's side , we have to decide to open our hearts to the griefs and pain all around us . It 's not an easy decision . A dangerous one too . And a tiny narrow door to enter into a whole new world . " But in that world a great experience waits for us : meeting the One who 's entered there before us . He suffers more than any of us could because His is the deepest emotion and the highest perception . " Not , mind you , that He approves of suffering or wills it . Quite the opposite . And He does n't just leave us and Himself in the anguish . At the point where His ultimate in love meets His total capacity to absorb and feel all our agony , there the miracle happens and the exterior situation changes . I 've seen that miracle . " Looking at my puzzled expression , Miss Alice said quietly , " Probably I 'm not making sense to you , Christy . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . All of us have watched it work in small situations . Well , what I 'm talking about is a vast multiplication of that power . " " I 'm not sure I do understand . But I want to , " I told her . She nodded , smiling at me with her eyes , saying nothing more , falling into one of her Quaker silences . She can be so eloquent , then so quiet  --  but always poised . She 's a beautiful woman , not just the way she looks either . There 's a deeper kind of beauty in her too : the beauty of a near perfect relaxation . An aura of peace . A knowledge of being at home in the universe . A sense of belonging . It seems effortless but now I know that it was not : sometime in the past she cane to terms with life . How ? It must have been painful . She just said so . But that was a long time ago , and now  --  that inner re-96Ilaxation that sometimes even borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . But around and behind my thoughts , still before me in the silence stood the big question : Was I going home ? Or was n't I ? I knew that Miss Alice had not been trying to philosophize ; she had been talking directly to the point at issue . " So what does all this have to do with my going home or not ? " I dared to ask her . " Everything to do with it . Who are you , Christy ? " " I wish I knew . " " But you can know . You 're important , terribly important . Each of us is . You 're unique . So is David . And Miss Ida . And I ) r . MacNeill . No one else in all the world can fill David 's place , or mine , or yours . If you do n't do the work that 's been given you to do , that work may never be done . " She rose to go . " It 's late and you 're tired . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you supposed to come here , Christy ? Or were you just running away from home ? " And she was gone . EightI AWOKE to a sunshiny morning feeling so good that at first I had trouble remembering what I had been so gloomy about the night before . Oh , yes  --  the O'Teale cabin and my feelings of inadequacy as a teacher . But nothing could be that bad , I thought , as I stood before the front window savoring my view , feeling the warmth of the sun through the glass . The tops of the far peaks were still mushroomed in clouds , but the sun in the valley would soon melt the snow and we would see the ground again . Spring could not be far away . I had driven with my parents and my brother George , first in our carriage and then in our Dodge touring car , up into the mountains around Asheville every spring for as far back as I could remember . Spring . . . That first pale fresh green suddenlylacing the mountainsides . Then the blur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its branches like strokes from the brush of some Japanese artist . And the pure white of the dogwood climaxed by the flame of the azaleas . I longed to see that procession of bloom again . Then I realized there was something else I wanted more than to see spring in the mountains  --  to be with Miss Alice . I could learn so much from her . Where else could I find a teacher like her ? ' What she had said last night about running back to the ivory tower had not only stuck to me like a burr , but it still pricked . I did not want my prime consideration to be thinking of myself , protecting myself . Nor did I want to be a quitter . Odd . . . It suddenly struck me that this train of thought  --  springtime , learning from Miss Alice  --  did not belong to someone who was leaving immediately for Asheville . And that was how I knew that somehow , some way in the night behind me , I had decided . Somehow this Cove was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to give , I had to give it here . It was as Miss Alice had said last night , we have to decide to give  --  even in hard spots where there 's lots of evil . Well , I had decided . I rested my forehead on the cold wood of the window sill . " Dear God , " I said inside myself , " When I came here , maybe I was partly running off from home for fun and freedom and adventure . But I have a notion that You had something else in mind in letting me come . Anyway if You can use me here in this Cove , well , here I am . " That morning I entered the schoolroom eagerly . In an effort to understand " my " children better , two weeks before I had decided to assign the older ones a theme . They were to write on " What I Want to Do When I Grow Up . " The themes turned out to be even more revealing than I had imagined . Clara Spencer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to have a lot of shoes like Catskins did in the mountain story ; two , three pairs even . And I want a fine house with enough pans to cook in and a rug on the floor to sink my toes in . " Rob Allen had different dreams : 98 " . . . Sometimes I get to feeling lonesome . I want to tell my thoughts , my good thoughts on the inside , to somebody without being laughed at . It would pleasure me to know the right way to put things like that on paper for other people too . I do n't want to keep mill when I grow up , just read books instead . . . . " Ruby Mae wrote that she wanted to smell nice and have lots of pretty shirtwaists like Teacher . Smith O'Teale wanted " to go far away from home across the mountains to the level lands and get me a fine job with plenty to eat . " There was only one theme that sounded a false note , Wraight Holt 's . Unsuspecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and began reading : " I thought at your question about growing up . I disgust being a slickfaced boy and want to be a masterest man-person now . I wud be proud for a woman grown something like you are to claim me for her feller because when I set eyes on yer hair and yer pretty clothes that fit you so neat I can not think a solitary thing about my book learning . It wud tickle me right smart to carry you for a walk anytime now . " Hastily , I thrust it to one side under some other papers . But color had flooded into my face as I realized the gist of what Wraight had written , and instantly the three boys at the back of the room were smirking . Wraight 's theme did serve a purpose , however , because it raised to my conscious mind a problem which I now realized had been nagging me at a deep level : why were these boys in school ? By now I realized that everyone in the Cove was surprised to see Lundy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen children were attending . This was my first real-life glimpse of the family feuding that even Miss Alice had acknowledged . When I asked David , he explained , " A long way back , Aliens and Taylors got shooting at one another . I 'm not sure anybody much remembers now what the fighting was about . I ca n't figure it out  --  this is the first time Bird's-Eye 's ever let Lundy come near the school . Makes people uneasy . Maybe it 's just that Miss Alice 's teaching about forgiveness is finally making a dent in the Cove 's hate-traditions. " 991I would like to have thought that was the explanation . Instead , there was the reluctant conviction that something else was afoot . Meanwhile , the themes were dramatizing for me the poverty of the Cove . Most of the boys and girls could not see beyond the next corn crop . One pair of shoes would be wealth indeed . Most had only the vaguest idea of the world beyond the mountains . Naturally the mission reflected this poverty . Everywhere I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we needed . One day after finishing the compositions , I deliberately took a walk through the mission house , notebook and pencil in hand . In my mind were the irksome home situations of a few of my students . Some had to walk long distances to school . There were occasions when the deep snows or the ravaging sleet storms made it impossible for them to get to school . Already I was findingthat spotty attendance and interrupted work were slowing down the entire group . So there had always been the thought of taking in a few boarders for the worst winter months . That was why Miss Alice had designed such a large house . The barnlike room on the third floor could be used as a sort of dormitory . But before we could make even a beginning with the boarding school , we needed all sorts of supplies , even money for food for boarders . So I began my list . There were no shades at any window ; no rugs . All the mattresses were makeshift and dreadful . The linen closet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Ida 's kitchen cupboard lacked even basic cleaning supplies . Then my thoughts went to the yard . The mission did not own a horse for us to ride . There was only Old Theo , a mule with a crippled hip . Miss Alice had her own horse Goldie , but since her regular routine kept her in Cutter Gap only every third week , Goldie was of little use to the rest of us . David and I had talked about the fact that buying a horse could not be postponedmuch longer . Yet a good horse cost about a hundred dollarsand Dr. Ferrand struggled for every penny he sent us . That night as I sat in my room looking at this long list of things we needed before we could take even a few boarders , loowondering where it was all going to come from , I remembered the words that Miss Alice had quoted from the Bible the night before . Something about " pressed down and running over . " There was a picture in my mind of golden wheat being heaped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verse  --  but where in the Bible was it ? I got out my Sunday-school-graduation Bible , rather guilty to find it near the bottom of my trunk , and began turning the unfamiliar pages . I was glad Miss Alice was not there to see how long it took me to find that passage . Finally I stumbled on it . " Give , and it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bosom . For with the same measure ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again . " I chuckled to myself at those heaped-up words piled on top of one another like the golden wheat : Good measure . . . pressed down . . . shaken together . . . running over . An exuberant promise , if ever I had seen one ! Abundance sure enough . My thoughts carried over into my own kind of prayer . . . " Lord , Miss Alice said that if we give , it shall be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord . And so are Dr. Ferrand and David . And even I 'm trying to give , though I do n't yet see what I have that You can use . I do n't have the faith that Miss Alice has , Lord , in You , in this Book , in anything . Can You help me with my faith ( I hope it is n't wrong to ask this ) by giving unto us  --  as it says here , good measure ? Maybe by giving unto us a horse or  --  or anything else on the list . . . ? " TI TREE DAYS LATER Mr. Pentland brought me a letter postmarkedPlainfield , New Jersey . The heavy cream-colored envelopehad been addressed with a distinctive feminine handwriting , very large capital letters slanting sharply to the right . As I opened it , a check dropped into my lap . It was for one hundred and six dollars , made out to me . ' Wonderingly , I read : Dear Miss Huddleston : I hope that you will forgive a stranger writing to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I was visiting'or my sister , Anne ( Mrs. Dellafield ) Boggs . At a tea which she gave in my honor , I met your mother . In my presence , some of the ladies were inquiring about you , and your mother told  --  most charmingly  --  aboutthe contents of some of your recent letters , your fascinatingpupils , their needs and so on . On the journey home , I could not get this off my mind . Then in the pile of mail waiting for me at home there was an unexpected , larger-than-usual dividend check from some stock of mine . My husband ( who is the head of a linen import firm ) and I are trying the experiment this year of tithing all our gross income and giving it , as we feel led , to churches and charities . The enclosed check represents the ten percent on my dividend check . My heart tells me that it belongs to your work . Since I could not for the life of me remember the exact name of the mission , I have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real joy . Yours most sincerely , Lucy Mae Furnam ( Mrs. Charles Furnam ) The horse ! It was for the horse ! Of course . " David  --  Da  --  vid ! Where are you ? " I went running through the house waving the check in the air . " Here I am . Here in the kitchen . " " David , look ! Just look . . . Is n't it great ! " " What 's great ? " He was lifting the lids of Miss Ida 's pans steaming and bubbling on the stove , sniffing them one by one . " Stop waving that piece of paper in my eyes . " He took the check , read the amount , and whistled . " Say , not bad . Who 's Mrs. Furnam ? " " I do n't know her ! She was visiting in Asheville and heardabout the mission at a tea . This is her tithe on some unexpected money  --  David , remember you said that a good horse would cost about a hundred dollars . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Furnam meant it for the mission , Miss Alicewill think she should send it to Dr. Ferrand . " " Oh , no  --  she could n't ! " " She sure could . " " Not when she hears what 's behind it , she would n't . " " What do you mean , what 's behind it ' ? " I was shy about telling him . " Well , David , it 's that  --  you see , Miss Alice believes that the things that are promised in the102Bible are there for us to claim . So  --  I tried it . I found a special promise and I asked God to send us some of the things we need around here  --  like a horse  --  some of the other things we need too . So David , this is it . Do n't you see ? This is it ! " " Christy , you surprise me . Really you do . " His voice was gentle . " Do you honestly think this Mrs.  --  whatever her name isl'urnamsent this check as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night in your bedroom ? Probably she would have sent the check anyway . A coincidence . Perfectly natural thing for her to do . Nice though . Hope we can use it for a horse . " But when I told Miss Alice the story , she agreed at once to our using Mrs. Furnam 's check for a horse . " Then you do n't think the check was just a coincidence ? " I asked her . " No . I think you reached out for faith in the best way you knew . I think it 's the intent of the heart that matters . And I think you got your answer . " " But David seemed to think I was silly  --  " " Perhaps you misread David . " " I do n't think so . " " Anyway , what goes on at a deep level inside you , Christy , is not silly , whatever else it may be . " " Oh , Miss Alice ! " I hugged her . To help in purchasing a horse , David took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sharp trader and a good judge of horseflesh . At Overbrook Farm near Lyleton , they found " Prince , " a black stallion with a distinctive white star on his head , a long silky mane and a flowing tail . Mr. Holcombe came back saying , " Blamed if he ai n't the finest brute-beast ye ever flung yer leg over . " And David , having picked up the horsedealer'sjargon , talked knowingly about Prince having " good depth of chest , well-muscled withers and slender , strong legs . " lie and Mr. Holcombe bid the horse in for ninety-five dollars and paid thirteen dollars and ninety-eight cents for a saddle and bridle . " Roughly three dollars more than Mrs. Furnam 's check , " 103JDavid reported to me . " If we were going by the gospel accord- ing to Christy , Prince plus his saddle should have cost exactly one hundred and six dollars , not one penny more , not one penny less . Some angel got his figures garbled . Anyway , I made up the small difference out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflate me . " Give and it shall be given unto you ! " From being weak , my faith now knew no bounds . Mother had been sending me her copy of the Ladies ' Home Journal each month as she finished with it , partly , I sus- pected , as her way of reminding me that life along gracious and comfortable lines was still going on in the world . One night as I browsed through the latest issue , looking at some of the adver- tisements , an idea struck me . What about asking these adver- tisers to contribute not money , but some of their products to our mission ? Could I draft the kind of letter that would present the mission 's case dramatically  --  yet briefly enough  --  for a busi- ness firm ? In the same notebook in which I had made the list of needs , I turned to a fresh sheet . . . " Esteemed Sir : . . . " Pompous . I crossed that out . " Dear Sir : " Better . I plunged into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Asheville , North Carolina . A few months ago I accepted a job teaching a mission school in the Great Smoky Mountains . Quickly I discovered great destitution back here . . . " No , it would n't do . It was all wrong to begin the letter with me . I tore out the page and crumpled it up . If I were the executive of a mattress company or a window- shade company and received a letter from some unknown girl , would I read it ? After many tries , I evolved what I hoped was an acceptable letter , a sort of master one which could be altered to suit each company : Dear Sir : You are a busy man and do not know me , so I shall come to the point at once . This is to ask if you will share with us in our moun- tain mission work by making a donation of some of your fine Oster- moor mattresses to help furnish our mission house ? This is the story : This mission was established five and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern Appalachians in the Great Smoky Mountains , seven miles from the nearest rail- road . This is an inter-denominational work , now under the Amer-104ican Inland Mission , with Dr. Mercer O. Ferrand of Blytheville , Arkansas , at the head . We have a big mission house , a small chapel which doubles for weekday school and Sunday services both . I volunteered to come here from my home in Asheville , North Carolina , to teach in the school . There are sixty-seven pupils , all ages , quite a handful for a new teacher like me . There are some awfully bright pupils but we have only a few books and practically no supplies . Many of the children walk a long way , even four and five miles to school , some  --  believe it or not  --  barefoot even in the coldest winter weather . This work is supported entirely from free-will offerings . Funds are scarce . The highest salary paid to anyone on the mission staff is twenty-five dollars a month . Yet out of this situation , love and hope and help are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might like to be a part of this work . For our staff and for the boys and girls we hope to take in as boarders , a good night 's rest on one of your great Ostermoor mattresses could help a lot ! I shall be happy to supply references , any further information , or to answer any questions you may have . Let me thank you ahead of time for any help you may be able to give us . Yours most sincerely , Christy Rudd HuddlestonOver the next few days , exhilarated by the success with the horse , I got carried away with the letter writing and sat up nights working on it . After I had covered firms that manufacturedbasic items like shades , mattresses , and soap , I thought how nice it would be to have some communication with the outside world . So I included the Bell Telephone Company , askingthem to donate wires and equipment for a telephone . Then my mind went to those long winter evenings . How pleasant it would be to have a piano so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote to the Lyon and Healy Company . The promise said " heaped up . " I hoped that I was not overdoingit . NineRUBY MAE was sitting sideways on a straight chair in my bedroomwhile I tried to comb out her shoulder-length tangled red 105hair . " Sorry if I 'm pulling . How long has it been since you combed this hair , Ruby Mae ? Or should n't I ask ? " " Factually , I lost my tuckin ' comb , " she answered sadly . " Disremember when . Onliest tuckin ' comb ever I had too . " " There are some bad tangles . " " Yes 'm , but my head ai n't tetchy . I 'll try not to holler when you hit them mouse-nests . Ohoo  --  weee ! " " Sorry . " " Do n't matter . What d'ye aim to do when ye git hit all combed out ? " " How about nice long braids ? Like Miss Henderson 's ? " " Be tickled to death with braids . But yell have t'learn me how . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And braiding hair is not the only thing I 'll have to teach you , I was thinking as I held the hair firmly in my left hand and eased the comb gently with my right , trying to unravel the snarls . Ruby Mae 's sole idea of cleanliness was to wash her face and hands a few times a week  --  never a full bath  --  with the resultthat it was not pleasant to be near her . I had dodged and fled and resisted until now I realized that there was no escape . One of Miss Alice 's Quaker sayings was apropos : " Such-andsucha person is meant to be my bundle . " Well , I might not like it , but Ruby Mae was clearly my bundle , no getting around it . That being so , there was nothing for it but to get on with teaching her what I could about cleanliness and basic grooming . After the hair , I was going to suggest a bath in the portable tin tub and then make her a gift of a can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her slovenliness was Ruby Mae 's chattering . It was an unthinking kind of talking , like tyingthe reins of a horse to the whip socket and letting him run off in whatever direction took his fancy . I had been almost at the point of making cotton plugs for my ears when another of Miss Alice 's teachings came to my rescue . " My father always told us , " she had said one night at the supper table when David was complaining about the slow progress of his belfry , " that if we will let God , He can use even our disappointments , even our annoyances to bring us a blessing. io6There 's a practical way to start the process too : by thanking Him for whatever happens , no matter how disagreeable it ( seems . " Though she had been speaking directly to David 's exaspera- tion with the mountain men whose promised help rarely mate- rialized , I had begun to wonder if it could not apply equally well to my feelings about Ruby Mae . But how could I ever bring myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to try it . I sat down and , feeling foolish , made myself say , " I thank You that Ruby Mae talks so much . " To my astonishment , even before the first day 's experiment was over , I was beginning to hear what Ruby Mae was really saying . Sud- denly , I did feel thankful , for here  --  so close that I had nearly missed it  --  was a priceless opportunity to get inside the moun- tain mind . Thus to Ruby Mae , the mission house was a mansion andiss Alice Henderson incredibly wealthy . " She come over here from Cataleechie . Independent rich , she was . Paid cash-moneyr this land . Built her cabin . Went right on , built this here ouse  --  so tall , like one house a-top another house same as a tack cake , without no by-your-leave from nobody . " Took a heap of paint too , pails and pails of hit , " the girl cut on with wonder in her voice , " to make the big house as White as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he did n't put a heap o ' windows in her cabin too , shiny glass windows to let the sun through . " Even more wonderful in Ruby Mae 's judgment had been the fact that Miss Alice had had two deep wells dug , one for ' the mission and one for her own cabin before the foundations had been laid . Pumps had been connected to the wells and stood Obcside the sinks in the two kitchens for " water piped right into the house , " obviously an unheard-of convenience in the Cove . It was delightful to see Miss Alice through Ruby Mae 's eyes . he had insisted on unprecedented things like having the pring in the yard covered . She kept telling the mountain peo- ple that they could get sick from dirty water , might even get the ( II cad typhoid . The little house over the spring was a pretty one , lattice-work painted white like the big house. 107 It seemed that Alice Henderson had started a Sunday school , then a few months after that a worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman would " take up church " and speak in public . ' c , " First off , folks was so scandalized they could n't see straight , " Ruby Mae reminisced . " Old men used t ' snort , I can hear them yit , Ai n't nary bitty sense in it . ' Said , Wimmin and keepin ' house belong together like sap and bark . Nothin ' a-tall outside the house and yard be fittin ' for wimmin . ' " Miz Henderson had gumption , did n't pay them no mind . In no time a-tall some folks was argufyin ' with the snortin ' ones , sayin ' No sech thing . The string of her talk is good . I confidence the way she jest rares back and faces us down . She do n't have the weavin ' ways of most man-preachers . Just talks quiet , like a woman , says things I memorize during the week , can think on while I 'm a-doin ' up my work or plowin ' or haulin ' my corn to mill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained to the Cove people that in the Society of Friends the women had always taken an equal role with men , a new idea in the mountains . Yet the truth was that the highlanders had never heard anyone , man or woman , talk like this one . Behind and underneathRuby Mae 's gossipy words was the lasting impression made on her by the Quaker lady 's emphasis on two favorite subjects  --  the love of God and the immediacy of His guidance for anyone willing to receive it . Miss Alice kept insisting that God wants all of us to be happy . To the mountain people this was at first suspect because their religion equated happiness with what they called " the pleasures of the world . " They reasonedthat those who were enjoying themselves must certainly be sinning . But to Miss Alice it was lack of joy that was the heresy . Though Ruby Mae 's summation of all this was halting and con- J fused and incredibly picturesque , the gist of it got through to me . By delving deep into Scripture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice Henderson was constantly painting a picture of a God who longs to guide His creatures into goodness , kindness , caring , justice , unselfishness . Irresti- io8 bly , her listeners were drawn back again and again to hear more . They came as thirsty people ; they had been thirsty for a long time . Quietly , Miss Alice was demonstrating this God of love and beauty too  --  in small ways and in large . For a few , the concept that life did not have to be all starkness and misery was slowly taking root . Tentatively , timidly  --  constantly encouragedby Miss Alice  --  some of the women were at last reachingout for light and beauty and joy . FROM UPSTAIRS I heard an incessant banging on the front door , then Ruby Mae 's heavy footsteps . " Law me ! I 'm a-comin ' . Do n't pound hit down ! " There was the sound of a muffled male voice and then the girl loudly summoning me . As I reached the head of the stairs , Ruby Mae called up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bessie 's Paw . " " Howdy , ma'am , " the man said . " I 'm on my way to mill . Stopped to tell ye about our neighbor-baby . The Mel-Tones ' baby  --  she quit breathin ' last night . Opal 's carryin ' on right bad . This was the only gal-baby followin ' a passel of three boys . She says , would ye come , Miss Christy ? Miss Henderson 's over Big  --  Lick Spring way . Opal says if she 's got to give up this least'un , would ye come and fix up the baby real pretty ? " Me , fix up a dead baby ? But I had never even seen anyone who had died , let alone prepared a body for burial . " I 'm so sorry about the baby , " I stammered . " Of course I 'll come . Isaak told me at school that his new baby sister was n't well . What was wrong ? " " They thought it was liver-growed . Were n't even no time to call Doc MacNeill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was , then quickly decided I 'd better wait and ask David or Miss Alice . " Mr. Coburn , do you think Mrs. McHone has a baby dress ? " " Do n't reckon they had nothin ' for this baby . " ' " Then I 'll try to find something here . Oh  --  and I 'm not sure I remember how to get " I nodded . " When the crik branches , ye take the right fork for a mile , then cut acrost Coldsprings Moun-tain , then hit 's the second right hand holler nigh onto Turkey Trot Crik . " To my relief , Ruby Mae came to the rescue . " I know where ' t is . I 'll show you the way . " As I searched for a baby dress in the mission 's used-clothing box , I kept wishing for Miss Alice  --  or David . Where was he ? Out calling ? I was not the one for this assignment . Yet how could I refuse to go ? Finally I found a baby dress that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated goingawaygifts from friends in Asheville . These I put in a basket with a cake of soap , some clean rags , some safety pins and a needle and spool of thread . It was two o'clock in the afternoon by the time Ruby Mae and I started . She knew the route all right , but to me it seemed a long way . At last we reached the edge of a clearing at the foot of Big Butt Knob beyond Coldsprings Branch . The setting of this cabin was different from any other I had seen because it stood in the horseshoe bend of a wide creek . The effect was of a peninsula surrounded by the stream on three sides , with woodlandand the rising mountain to the back . Several immense old trees , their bare branches stark in the winter sky , grew near the cabin . " That 's it there . That 's the McHones ' . " Ruby Mae put her hand to her mouth . " Hallo  --  it 's us  --  Ruby Mae and Teacher ! " Almost immediately the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rickety cabin . She was a young woman with abundant brown hair . She had tried to part it on the side , but it was so carelessly pinned up that strands of hair straggled down her neck . Brown eyes looked out from a white face , so drawn that it made her look ill . She was wearing a skirt and an old sweater buttoned over her stomach and men 's shoes . The house was built in two sections several feet off the ground , as on stilts , with a crude dog trot between . As with all of the mountain homes , no paint had ever been used and the building had weathered to a silvery-gray . Part of the porch ap- no geared to be held up by bean poles so that we walked across a floor listing to one side . Mrs. McHone received us warmly and seemed eager to talk . " The baby cried something awful all night and we thought it was liver-growed . " " Mrs. McHone , I never heard of that . What 's liver-grown ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby by the left heel and the right hand and make them tetch . Then you take the left hand and the right heel , and if'n they wo n't tetch then you know hit 's liver-growed . " " What do you do then ? " " You got to force the hand and heel to tetch . When I pulled , the baby hollered and went as limp and white as a new-washed rag doll . Never could do nothin ' with her after that . Give her tea all night long , but nothin ' holped . Jest afore the sunball come up , we heerd the death tick in the wall . Jest quit breathin ' then , she did . " The woman had started crying quietly , wiping her eyes with the edge of her apron . She led us inside the house and pointed to the little waxen body lying in the middle of a large bed , a white cloth over the tiny face . The horror of this sickened me . The baby must have had cruel internal injuries . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a callous , indifferent mother but had acted out of love , love mired by her ignorance and by the superstitionhanded down to her . At that moment , for the first time in my life , I knew grief . I had had childish disappointments , yes . Hurt pride , often . A sense of loss , sometimes . But compared to what I was feeling now , these had been superficial emotions because they were so self-centered . On my tongue now was the first bitter taste of a grief not my own . My heart was mirroring back from the world 's pain just one episode from all the endless woes and infamies caused by the not-knowing and the not-caring . Opal McHone had not known what she did . And I had to understand and to forgive her on that basis , otherwise I could be no comfort to her at all . With relief , I turned for a moment to the three McHone boysIIIwho had been standing in the background watching . Toot and Vincent were still tiny ; Isaak , the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , unusual with such white-blond hair . I wondered why I found Isaak so appealing . Perhaps it was the trace of small-boy plumpness left in his cheeks , and the dark , broodingeyes that looked out on the world with a certain quizzical expression . He was wearing his usual raggedy patched overalls over a shirt equally threadbare and heavy work shoes that looked several sizes too large . The brown eyes were watching my every move as he saw his teacher in a new role . The father , Tom McHone , diffidently came forward and shook my hand . Then the older man , Uncle Bogg , said , " Howdydo , Miss . Mighty proud that ye drapped in . " He smiled at me with his mouth shut to hide his almost toothless state . I had heard of this man . Everybody in the Cove called him " Uncle Bogg " and laughed whenever they spoke of him . He was shinybaldon the top of his head , but what hair remained was long and curled jauntily , like fluff , over his ears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep creases across his forehead and around his eyes , and several days ' growth of stubble on his chin completedan amazing picture . " Let me holp ye if I can , " he offered . " I can git ye some water . " He meant for the washing before the laying out , so there was no avoiding getting on with it . While he went for the water , I saw that five beds were crowded into this main room of the cabin . There was also a quilting frame set up near the fireplace with a quilt stretched on it . " Aye , here ' t is , " Uncle Bogg set a pail of water on the floor by me . " Calculate that 'll be enough . Ye mought need this too . " It was a copper basin . Mrs. McHone sat on the edge of the bed and watched while Ruby Mae and I washed the ivory body . The baby 's eyelids were transparently thin with the fine lines of blue veins still showing . The little rosebud mouth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the droop that wrenched me. 112 " It was to be , I reckon , " she said . " Hit was the Lord 's will . We'uns just has to bow to it . The Lord giveth and the I , ord taketh away . Blessed be . .. " I thought I would scream if she finished the sentence . I bit my lips to keep from saying what I was thinking . It had to be said sometime  --  but not now , not right now . Someday this mother must understand that God 's will had been this beautifully formed baby girl with a fuzz of blond curls on her shapely head . As I took one of the tiny hands in mine to wash it  --  the dimpled fingers that should have been warm and clinging to my fingers  --  I wanted to lash out against something , somebody . Dr. MacNeill  --  why was n't he teaching mothers how to take care of their babies ? Surely his call of duty went beyond peddlingpills and crude operations . Now there would be another tiny grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as she had been in this Cove , why had n't she found a way to teach these people better ? Of course , I knew perfectly well that I was too new to stand in judgment of either the Doctor or Miss Alice . My father had always scolded me for my snap judgments and sweeping condemnations . But what a world of teaching needed to be done back in these mountains ! That alone could use a full-time worker . Though I understood Miss Alice 's efforts to underscore the fine heritage of these people and to build on that , I could also see just by looking around me how we tend to over-romanticize history . Life in those other centuries had not been all knightsand-ladiesstuff . There was nothing romantic about cottages where eight or ten people slept in one room with no privacy ; where there were no bathrooms , not even outside privies  --  even if the cottage did happen to have picturesque thatch on the roof . There was nothing glamorous in any century about no runningwater in which to bathe or about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which some of the women right now , in 1912 , dipped snuff and then rubbed their teeth and gums . So many of the people had terrible-looking teeth or no teeth at all . And the eye trouble that was so prevalent . I113Ihad learned that it was trachoma and that it was a dangerous infectionwhich , if unchecked , resulted in blindness . All at once a heavy shadow blotted out the cabin door . I looked up to see three men standing there . " We 've come to see the fancy layin ' out . " The voice was thick . All of the men were unsteady on their feet ; it was obvious that they were drunk . Trying to ignore them , I turned back to my task . " Come on in , if'n ye must , " Uncle Bogg said , " but do n't none of ye bother Miz Christy . " He made no effort to introduce the men . " Now ai n't that purty ! Ribbons  --  aah  --  law ! " The tallest of the three was leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of home-brewed liquor was overpowering . The face with the bloodshot eyes and the heavy black beard was distastefully close . I recognized this man : he was Ault Allen , Bob Allen 's brother , the one who had not wanted Dr. MacNeill to operate . I moved away as far as possible to the head of the bed and sat down to sew ribbon rosettes on the little dress . One of the men was staring at me , then I saw him wink at his friends . The room was growing dark but no one seemed to think of lighting lamps . When finally I had the dress on the baby , Mrs. McHone came and picked up the little body , cradling it in her arms . " It even has ribbons . No baby in the Cove has ever had ribbons afore . It 's plumb purty , as pleasant as the flowers . " Her rough fingers caressed the sheer cotton fabric . " My baby 's so purty . Oh , Miz Christy , I 'm obleeged to you ! " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groped for something cornfortingto say , but I was out of my depth and knew it . " Maybe  --  maybe you 'll have another baby girl sometime . " The man lolling on the foot of the bed laughed uproariously . " That oughten to be hard . Breedin 's easy for Tom . He 's as healthy as a coot . " Uncle Bogg came forward , anger in his voice . " You can jest shut up . Not never one more word out'n you . Devil take ye ! You 're drunk , jest plain drunk and this ai n't no time for talk like that . " " It 's late , " I said . " If there 's nothing else Ruby Mae and I can do . . . 114 " I 'll git the lantern lit and see ye to the aidge of the woods , " l Jncle Bogg said . " Thanks so much , but you do n't have to do that . The old man appeared not to have heard me . He was watchingthe drunken men as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberation he lifted a lantern off a nail in the wall , lighted it , took a rifle from its rack beside the fireplace , and started out , beckoning us to follow . At the edge of the clearing , Uncle Bogg paused , lifted his hand up to caution us not to speak and then stood , listening intently . I heard nothing unusual , but after a time , he said with sudden vehemence , " I 'm a-goin ' with you to the Mission . " " But that 's too much , " I protested . " Ruby Mae knows the way and it 's a long walk to the Mission and back . " " No use argufyin '  --  long walk do n't matter . I 'm a-goin ' . C'm on . " And the old man set off walking briskly and silently between Ruby Mae and me . I knew that it was useless to protest . Soon we saw that he was taking a different way back to the Mission . The path led through great pillared tulip trees , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twigs crunched underfoot . All around us was the chatter of the little boomers , the red squirrels , and at a distance , the drumming of ruffed grouse . Uncle Bogg kept throwing the lantern light first to one side of the path , then to the other . His eyes were searching the woods , though it was impossible to see more than a few feet . There was a tenseness in him that had quickly communicated itself to Ruby Mae and me . Suddenly a twig snapped loudly in the woods to our left and all of us jumped . The old man stopped , set the lantern down on the ground , his gun instantly in position , his right hand on the trigger . But our straining ears heard only the creakingof the branches and the eerie cry of a hoot owl . " Thought I hcerd a varmint , " he explained after a long time . The explanation was not convincing . Wild animals would not make him that jittery . Few wolves or wild boars must be left in these mountains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hunting was the sport they liked best. 1151Ruby Mae 's face looked chalky white in the dim light . " Thought I seen a shadder movin '  --  there ! " she whispered , pointing into the woods , sidling closer to Uncle Bogg . Once again the old man raised the lantern and peered . " Lots of shadders , " he answered briefly . " C'm on , let 's go . " He quickened his pace so that Ruby Mae and I had trouble keeping up with him . I noticed that he kept his right hand on his gun . No , he was not watching for animals . I was relieved when Uncle Bogg suddenly broke the silence . " Miss Christy , onybody told you yit about the tall cornstalk in our backyard ? " " Tall cornstalk ? No . " " Wal , it happened like this  --  Our family was all out on the porch ' bout the crack of dawn one mornin ' shellin ' a turn of seed corn for plantin ' when Opal called us to come git @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden talkativeness , I was delighted to sense a tall tale coming . " When I went to break- fast , I drapped the ear of corn I was shellin ' off'n the porch . After we 'd et , I saw that the ear of corn had fell into the pig trough . Water in the trough had done swelled up one of the grains on that corn cob to ' bout as big as a small apple . Wal , I shelled the rest of it off , but put that big one in my pocket . " Went on down to the field to plant the seed corn . Directly felt somethin ' bumpin ' my leg . Swear-r-r , if that grain of corn had n't swelled big as a ball . Took it out , set it at the aidge of the field , went on plantin ' . " Got all the corn in by the aidge of dark . Went to look at that grain of corn  --  would n't you know  --  hit had swelled so , looked big as a pumpkin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story was rolling out exuberantly now . Uncle Bogg was still walking fast , as alert as ever , and as he talked he kept hold- ing the lantern up and peering into the woods . I realized now that he was deliberately trying to divert us . " Wal , I called Tom and Isaak and we dug a good-size hole , rolled that grain of corn in . Shoveled the dirt over , stomped it down , turned to go , when a-whammity-bang , heard some-116thin ' behind us . Jerked round , and that stalk of corn had shot out'n the ground and was already ten foot or so in the air . " Wal , that evenin ' Jeb Spencer come over , said one of his cows had got out . Asked had we seen her . Told him we had n't . " When Jeb started to leave , I asked him , Jeb , did you ride over ? ' Said he had . Where 'd you tie your mare ? ' " To a big saplin ' there in your cornfield . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Boys and me went down with Jeb to the field where we 'd been plantin ' and I says to him , Is that where you tied the mare , Jeb ? ' " Yep , that 's the place all right . ' " We looked , but there war n't no sign of any horse . Jeb had thought that cornstalk was a poplar tree or somethin ' . Told Tsaak to run for the lantern and my old rifle . Flashed the lanternup that stalk and Lord help my time-a-day , thar was the mare ' bout sixty foot off'n the ground a-hangin ' by the bridle . So Isaak held the light and I shot the bridle rein in two , and when the horse fell , Jeb got on and rode off back home . " The story was having the effect Uncle Bogg wanted . Ruby Mae was chuckling , " That 's the most plumb durn foolishness I ever heard . " " No such thing . " " Uncle Bogg , " she giggled , " everybody knows you like a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little careless-like to git one . " " Why , you need n't be so gosh-derned skeptical . What I 'm tcllin ' you is facts as pure as Scripture . Why , in less than two weeks time that cornstalk was as tall as a big oak tree . It sprouted a purty big ear for every blade , most of ' em ' bout a hundredfoot from the ground . Slowed up a little when the rest of the corn tasseled out and commenced silkin ' . You could n't see the corn on that stalk by then , not even with a spyglass . " Come cuttin ' time we had to ask all our neighbor folks to holp . Took me and Tom and Jeb Spencer and all the men we could git together most all day hackin ' at that cornstalk . ' Bout sundown it started a-fallin ' . We watched it fall awhile , but it got117plumb fit dark before it had fell all the way . Heard it hit the ground about midnight . Made a purty big racket . Woke us up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fell over a big scope of land . ' Bout day-bust , we walked up into the pasture field to see which-a-way it had fell . It lay acrost the crik , over Jeb 's place , by some thick woods northside of the road . And still we could n't see the end of it . We rode over Coldsprings Branch and all the way acrost Pebble Mountain , and  --  do n't you know  --  directly t' other side of the mountain we met a string of people who had come from miles around to see that thar cornstalk . Some excite-ment , runnin ' hither and yon . Matter of fact , that cornstalk was lyin ' yander acrost the Tennessey-North Carolina line and the state police were gatherin ' . Hit was a fear- some sight to behold . Course , we acted like we 'd never seed that cornstalk before in our born lives , jest wheeled and run , come back home like streaks of greased lightnin ' . " The moon had risen and we were coming out of the woods . Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathing everything in a soft amiable light . I looked back and realized that we were almost home . Uncle Bogg had so beguiled us with his tall tale that he had brought us all that long way through the woods without our knowing it . " Mission house jest around the bend now , " the old man said blithely . " Be glad to see it myself . " As we reached the edge of the mission yard , we saw David leaning on the fence . He came striding forward to meet us . " Am I glad to see you ! Where have you been ? Uncle Bogg , thanks for walking the girls home . " The old man set the lantern on the ground and let go a stream of tobacco juice . " You 're not half as glad as I am t ' see you . Opal 's baby died last night . She asked Miz Christy to come and holp lay out the young'un . Whiles she was doin ' that , some neighbor-men come in . They 'd had too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hold the story a minute , Uncle Bogg . " David turned to us , " Girls , Ida has waited supper for you . Guess you 'd better go on in and eat it . " 118We told Uncle Bogg good-bye and as we turned toward the house , I heard David say , " You know a Cutter Gap man  --  drunk or sober  --  would n't harm a woman . " But what Uncle Bogg answered we could not hear . TenI'HE WAY sometimes led through the woods , sometimes along the edge of cliffs tilted precipitously over ravines . I was glad to be riding the mission mule rather than the new horse Prince . Theo might be ancient and disreputable-looking and have one bad hip , but at least he was sure-footed on the mountain trails . An hour ago when we had set out for the Lufty Branch church ( where David held an outpost Sunday school twice a month ) he had insisted that I ride Prince , but I had demurred . The stallion was too spirited for me . All of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse so fiery that only he could ride him , but he consistently ignored our comments . There he was now on a dangerously narrow ledge , controllingthe beautiful black animal with a softly spoken sentence and a touch of the hand . We were coming now to the deepest part of the woods . David and Prince were already out of sight among the tall trees . Here where the virgin timber grew , the path was wider . Tulip trees , giant beeches , and red spruce lifted massive limbs overhead to form an arching roof like a cathedral . Theo 's slow jogging  --  nothing could ever persuade Theo to go faster  --  would turn one into either a philosopher or a dullard . All around me the trees stood sentinel over a solitude that stretched backward into time . It awed me to realize that these proud trees had been here for centuries before any human eye had seen their grandeur . Later the trees had stood vigil over the Indians  --  Cherokee land . After that had come the first white settlers streaming down from Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few riding , with their worldly possessions on pack horses  --  an axe , a gun , a frying pan , 119 some gunpowder , a little salt , and some starter-dough . As they struggled along the Indian trails or followed the river-routes to make their way in a new land , they had looked upon the same trees I was seeing now . Silence enfolded me . Here in the deep forest even the animals ' hooves were muted , for underneath was a carpet of pine needles inches thick . Suddenly my mule stumbled over a root in the path and I reached out to pat his neck reassuringly . Immedi- ately David called back over his shoulder , " You all right ? " " Yes , fine . Theo 's just dragging his feet . " David reined in Prince and waited for me to catch up . " We 'd better stay together . " He looked at me and grinned . I knew that I was a funny sight , riding sidesaddle using a man 's tack . My long black woolen riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragging the ground . " I 'm self- conscious enough as it is , " I pleaded . " So do n't laugh at me , please . " " You should be riding Prince , " he retorted . " Change your mind ? " " No . I 'll stay this way . I 'm no horsewoman . You know that . " " You could be . It 's no harder than walking seven miles in the snow . " There was approval in his voice . We rode awhile longer in silence . When David spoke again his tone was serious . " Christy , do n't take any more trips away from the mission without me . " I stared at him , astonished at the change in his mood . " Why , David ? What 's the matter ? " He stared down at the reins he was holding , as though trying to make up his mind whether to speak or not . " I do n't know , " he said at last . " But when Uncle Bogg walked you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those three men from the cabin he was afraid of . " " Then  --  then what was it ? " " Some other men followed you through those woods , Christy . Men Uncle Bogg had never seen before . " Apparently my face did not register sufficient surprise be- cause he said it again more slowly . " Uncle Bogg did n't knowiaothem , Christy . And Uncle Bogg knows every man , woman and puppy-dog between here and the North Carolina line . " " They were strangers , then ? " " Not only strangers , but strangers from a long way away . And , Christy , until we find out who they are and what they 're doing here , I want you to stay close to the mission . " " But  --  what would bring anyone into Cutter Gap who did n't belong here ? What would strangers want here ? " " That 's what I do n't know , " David said , and again I heard the grim edge to his voice . " And that 's what I intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of rushing water . But not until Prince and Theo had rounded the bend did we see Big Spoon Creek plunging down the mountain across our path . 1 t was still frozen near the edges but in the center of the creek the water swirled and eddied , whipping itself into frothy bubblesas it plunged over rocks and floating branches . David halted on the bank , his eyes appraising the situation . " Water 's higher than I 've ever seen it . If Prince and Theo refuse to ford it , they wo n't be seeing us today at any Sunday school . " He looked at me quizzically , obviously trying to throw off the uneasy mood that had gripped us both . " I 'll go first and hope that Prince will set an example for old Theo . Wish me luck  --  " The stallion stepped confidently into the water . A few feet from shore Prince paused to drink . " Recognizes good drinking water when he sees it , " David flung over his shoulder . " Know what I 've discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let garbage or any such thing be dumped into a creek and they wo n't touch a drop . " When finally Prince had gotten all he wanted , he plunged on into midstream , carefully avoiding the biggest boulders . As soon as I saw horse and rider splashing up the opposite bank , I urged my mule into the creek . Everything went well until we were almost in the middle , then suddenly I felt icy water on my legs . " David , " I shrieked , " he 's falling . " " Stay on his back ! Hang on . Encourage him , he 'll make it . " The mule struggled but could not get his footing . I was lean- ing forward clutching Theo 's neck to keep from sliding off his back . I tried encouragement . " Take your time , old boy . There  --  now . Try again . Oh David , it 's his bad hip . I 'm too heavy for him . His bad leg slides right out . " David was shaking his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're too gentle with that old mule . Hit him with the bridle . Hit him harder . " Finally even David saw that it was no use . He groaned , " What a mess . Jump off and I 'll help you . " " No , do n't ! You 'll ruin your suit , " I called . " Stay there , I 'm coming . " The water was almost to my waist with my wet skirts tugging me downstream . I wanted to shed the heavy woolen one , but instead tried to drape it over one arm as I struggled toward shore . David pulled me up on the bank . My teeth were chattering . He began rubbing my hands between his . " We 've got to do something for you in a hurry . Doc MacNeill 's cabin is some- where near . If I can find it , I 'll take you there . " I nodded mutely as I tried to wring the water out of my skirt . By now the mule had gotten to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridle he said , " You ca n't walk in those sopping shoes either . You ride the horse , Christy , and I 'll lead poor old limping Theo and stay close to you . It ca n't be far . " We did n't say much as we went up the narrow trail . Our eyes were searching the horizon . Finally we saw a cabin , silvery gray etched against the shadows of Green Ridge . Smoke trailed from the chimney . " That 's it . Doc 's place , " David said with relief . He put his hand to his mouth and shouted . In a moment the door opened and a man 's stocky figure appeared . " Who is it ? " a voice called . David answered , and the Doctor came striding down the hill toward us . He was wearing brown corduroys and a plaid hunting shirt , open at the neck . I got the same impression of overflow- ing vitality that I 'd had in the Spencers ' cabin , only I could n't help thinking that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgical instruments in his hands . What was it about him that made him more like a farmer or a woodsmanthan a physician ? " Anything wrong ? " " Nothing serious . Christy got soaked in the creek . Could we dry her out by your fire ? " The Doctor turned his full attention to me  --  and again that curious look came into his eyes that I had noticed at the Spencercabin before the operation . " Delighted , " he said briefly . " Come on up . " At the top of the hill near the cabin door , I tried to dismount , only to find that my legs were numb with cold . David almost had to pry me off the stallion . " Oh , my shoes are so stiff , " I groaned . " Hang onto my arm . Only a few steps more . Once inside the door , I saw that this was strictly a man 's place . There was the smell of tobacco , stuffed deer heads on the walls , antlers , a bearskin rug on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly men . " Miss Huddleston , sit down here . " The Doctor pulled out a three-legged stool for me . He stood there scrutinizing me . Then suddenly he said , " Those clothes must n't dry on you . Let me see what I can find for you to wear . " I was only too willing . " My skirt 's wool . It 's going to take a while to dry . " The Doctor strode into an adjoining room and in a minute returned with some clothes over his arm . " Here , try these . " I took them . One was a faded flannel shirt . Then I held up a pair of man 's pants in front of me . Dr. MacNeill stood gazing down at me , his hazel eyes sweepingme up and down . " You ca n't wear those , " he concluded . " They come up to your armpits . " " She could turn up the pant legs , " David suggested . " But how would I hold them up ? Two of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's see what else we can do . " He paused a moment , then abruptly turned toward a closed door that I had not noticed before , to the right of the main living portion of the123cabin . Surprisingly , the Doctor took a key out of his pocket to unlock the door . I glanced over at David questioningly , but his eyes were fixed on the door which Dr. MacNeill had entered and then carefully closed behind him . He looked as puzzled as I.The minutes dragged by . I sank down on the little stool close to the fire . When our host still did not return , I found myself looking around the room . On a tilt-top table beside me sat a canister of tobacco with a man 's pipe lying beside it . The pipe was so distinctive-looking ! Gingerly , I picked it up to look more closely at the wide silver band on the stem . There were words engraved in an antique script on the silver , but they made no sense to me . . . Tha mo elms air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in its place . Just beyond the table on the hearth sat a luster jug with cattailsand dried flowers , now dust-covered . On the other side of the fireplace was something not quite in character with the rest of the furnishings  --  a low chair , certainly not a man 's chair judging from its dainty spindled back . Then my thoughts were pulled away by a gradual awareness of a clock tickingloudly on the mantel . Looking closely I could read the inscription : " London  --  1743 . " I wondered where the Doctor had gotten the clock . " Think you could get into this ? " Dr. MacNeill had walked into the room so softly that neither of us had heard him . Lookingover his shoulder , I saw that the door behind him had been closed again . He was holding up a flower-sprigged dress ; other garments were over his arm . " Oh , yes ! They look just my size ! " With difficulty I restrained my curiosity . " Better slip out of those wet shoes too . Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the room he indicated and he left me there , shutting the door after me . It was his bedroom . There was a pine four-poster bed with an unbleached homespun spread hastily pulled up over the voluminous featherbed , and a cherry chest of drawers . An open cupboard with medical books piled in124it , a small wooden chest , and one hooked rug completed the furnishings of the room . I spread the garments on the bed . The dainty underclothes were of fine lawn trimmed with handmade lace and narrow ribbon . When I stepped out of the wet riding skirt into the bloomers ( though slightly old-fashioned ) they fit as though they had been made for me . As I picked up the dress , a fragrance  --  woodruff , I thought it was  --  came from its folds . I had caught a whiff of that somewhere else recently , but I could n't place it . The dress was of barred muslin , a summer costume , but I could stay close to the fire . My return to the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiringly . " These are perfect ! " I was holding my wet clothes at arm 's length . " Could I dry these by the fire ? " " Sure . " Dr. MacNeill took the garments . " David tells me that you have to be at Lufty Branch crossroads by three . " The Doctorlooked at the clock on the mantle . " It 's two-thirty now . " David sat there considering , then made a decision . " That heavy wool wo n't dry in fifteen minutes , Christy . And you ca n't go out in this weather in a cotton dress . You stay here and I 'll go and make excuses for you . They 'll understand . By the time I get back , your skirt will be dry . " I agreed reluctantly . " Sorry I messed things up , David . " " Never mind . Does n't really matter . Thanks , Doc , for your help . " And David turned to go . Alone with Dr. MacNeill , I felt immediately ill at ease . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , I had not realized what a difference his presence made or how much I had been relying on him to shield me from the strangenessof the Doctor and his cabin . For there were contradictions in this man and his surroundings . All kinds of questions forced themselves to the surface . Why the locked door in a community where most of the peoplescarcely bothered to shut their front doors , much less lock them ? To whom had these clothes belonged ? From where125 were these evidences of education and refinement  --  like the pieces of fine old furniture , the framed inscribed photographs , and the pipe lying on the table with the wide engraved silver band on its stem ? Dr. MacNeill seemed of the mountains , yet strangely not of them . He would have had to get his medical education somewhere else . But then , once he had seen and known the world outside the Cove , why had he come back to practice medicine here and then let things go on as before  --  like that liver-grown superstition that had killed the McHone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a female . " The deep voice broke into my thoughts . " I 'm going to fix you a hot grog . " " Please do n't bother . I 'm thawed now . " " Not afraid of a little mountain dew , are you ? " My answer must have sounded defensive . " Not afraid . I just do n't like the taste . " " Then call it medicine , insurance against any side effects of your swim in the creek . " It was useless to protest ; Dr. MacNeill had a dominating way about him . As he took an old pewter jug from the shelf , wiped it , went about mixing the grog and placing it close to the fire , I studied his face . In profile it was a rugged face , as if the features had been chiseled out of rough stone and the final smoothing and polishingnever quite completed . Yet that was not quite right either , for when finally he turned to look at me , I saw that the hazel eyes were intuitive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he had a sensitive mouth , as if the sculptorhad given special attention to that . All in all , it was a strong , unmistakably masculine face . Yet his curly , sandy-reddish hair  --  apparently always too long and unruly  --  gave him a boyish look . The hair curled a bit at the back of his head and over the tips of his ears . And that restless habit I had noticed the day of the operation , of running his fingers through the back ends , squeezing them  --  he could not keep his fingers still . " Drink that . " There was a peremptory note in his voice . He thrust the pewter mug at me . X26 Dutifully I raised the mug to my lips but did not drink the bitter stuff . " Dr. MacNeill , I 'm confused about something . " He stopped and turned around to look at me , smile lines pulling at his mouth . " What do you mean ? " Now that I had taken the plunge , I was embarrassed . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask my questions . But then I blurted out , " Like babies dying . " " Are you referring to the McHone infant ? " I nodded . " I helped prepare the baby . " " I know you did . And you think I was remiss in my duty ? Not a real doctor to my people . Is that it ? " I looked him full in the face . " Yes , I admit it . I did have that thought . " Suddenly the Doctor became preoccupied with filling his pipe . Carefully he tamped in the tobacco . His hands looked just as they had that afternoon of the operation  --  stained and roughenedby work . His deliberation was maddening . " You 've a lot to learn about the mountain people , " he said finally . " I 've known Opal McHone all my life . She had a granny who came from Aberdeenshire originally , then lived in Ulster awhile  --  true Scotch-Irish . The old lady was revered in the Cove as an herbalist . Some of her knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liver-grown ailment . But granny 's word is still gospel . The Scotch-Irish are stubborn , you know . " " You mean Mrs. McHone wo n't listen to you ? " " Not when my word crosses granny 's . " He paused , then went on tersely . " I can guess your next question . You 're curious about the dress . " There was an almost imperceptible change in the expression on his face , a softening of the lines . " It belonged to my wife . She died three years ago in childbirth . Typhoid complications . " " Oh , I 'm sorry . " I found myself wanting to ask about the locked door and whether or not that had been her room . But the Doctor 's manner told me that the subject was closed for now . " As for me , " he went on , " I was born in this cabin . So were my parents and my grandparents . So you see  --  I 'm a hillbilly. " 127 1 " You do n't talk like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his time before answer- ing . " I lapse into mountain talk easily enough when I 'm with the natives , like an Irishman whose brogue gets thicker by the minute when he 's with another Irishman . However , I 've had some schooling outside  --  college , then medical school . " " If you do n't mind my asking  --  where ? " He did not answer immediately . He put two more logs on the fire , felt my skirt and turned it over . Then he said slowly , as if reining in his impatience with my questions , " When I was six- teen , a group of New York physicians and surgeons hired a spe- cial train and came down to the Smokies on a vacation hunt- ing trip . They used an uncle of mine as a guide . I went along to help carry their camping gear . For some reason they took a lik- ing to me , found out that I had ambitions to be a doctor . So  --  they made college and medical school possible for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bedside training at Jefferson Hospital and the Will 's Eye Hospital . " " Are those the pictures of some of the doctors ? " " Yes , great men , long-time friends . I owe them everything . " I rose to have a closer look at the pictures . The Doctor came and stood just behind me . " That 's James Healy , orthopedic surgery . . . McDougall , abdominal surgery . . . Kinnigan , a great professor of ophthal- mology . . . William S. Paget . . . . " I felt his breath on my neck . Abruptly , I walked over to the pictures on the other wall . " And these ? " " That 's Starr Gatlin  --  dead now . He was the brain surgeon who did the only trephine I ever witnessed . " " Trephine ? " " You know , the same surgery I performed on Bob Allen . Tricky operation . Matter of fact , that particular surgical pro- cedure has n't often been tried in our time . " " In our time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the trephine burr-hole was used fairly often by pioneer doctors for those who survived Indian scalpings . " " I did n't know anybody survived Indian scalpings. " 128 " Oh , a few . Naturally not when the whole top of the skull was hacked off . " I winced . " But I still do n't see how the operation would help . " " For anybody who lived through the scalping , the problem was how to get the skull covered again . So the frontier doctors used to bore a series of holes into the dura mater with a straight awl until they drew blood to the surface . That caused the scalp to grow again  --  in time . " Sometimes I wished that my imagination was not so vivid . " They did all that with no ether ? " " Was n't any ether . Anyone who lived through an Indian raid and being scalped was strong enough to stand a little more . " I had had enough of scalping . " Going back to the day of the operation , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hit by a girdled tree . . . " " Oh , that  --  a tree hacked with a deep series of gashes all round the trunk . The tree eventually rotted and died . In the process of rotting , those trees are always dangerous because they 're so easily wind-thrown . Girdling was the lazy frontier way of clearing land . Terrible waste of good lumber . But then the early settlers thought the timber supply limitless . " He paused . " But you said two questions ? " " Yes , Mary Allen  --  when she hove that axe into the floor , what was that about ? " He smiled . " Mountain superstition . Axe is supposed to keep a person from hemorrhaging . Maybe you do n't remember , but Mary tied a string around Bob 's wrist too . That 's to keep diseaseaway . " The Doctor was tapping the tobacco out of his pipe on the edge of the fireplace . Then he picked up a reed from the luster jug , ran it through his pipe stem and blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical situation here in the Cove , " he said . " Or  --  am I boring you ? " " No . I want to hear about it . " " Well then , as for the question in your mind about why I 'm not reforming things around here , if I did n't care about these people , I 'd sure be practicing medicine somewhere else . " 129 " You mean it 's a hard place to practice ? " He looked at me tolerantly . " I could soliloquize on that one for so long you 'd be yawning . I 'll limit myself to one fact : Last year I was out on calls one hundred and seventy-four different nights . " I found it hard to believe . " You mean you keep records about every night call ? " He shrugged , turned in his usual unhurried way to put anotherlog on the fire . Then he stood on the hearth , a faraway look in his hazel eyes , absently squeezing his hair in his fingertips . I wondered why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't care about his personal appearance . " I 'm practicing here in Cutter Gap , " he resumed , " because of a particular afternoon I spent with Starr Gatlin . It was a rainy May afternoon . How could I ever forget ? At that time I had three offers to consider for a beginning practice . Two were flattering offers . I was confused , torn about where my duty lay , how to make such an important decision . So  --  I went to see Dr. Gatlin . He was a wise old man . Just sat there smoking , let me do the talking . " By the time dusk was falling , I had talked myself out . And I knew what I had to do . The call of the mountains and my own people was too strong to deny . I knew how desperately they needed a doctor back in these hills and coves . Personal ambitiondid n't matter really . I 've never regretted that decision , simply because I would n't have been happy anywhere else . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably be as famous as Gatlin , McDougall , and the rest . I follow their careers with a lot of interest , rejoice in their successes , keep closely in touch with them . " With a sweep of his eyes he indicated the pictures . " As a matter of fact , they 're the ones whose gifts of money and drugs make it possible for me to practice in the Cove . " " It 's a sacrifice you 've made , though , " I said softly . " But since you did come back here , I do n't quite see  --  I mean  --  " " You do n't see that I 've accomplished much . You 've been at the mission how long , Miss Huddleston ? " " A little over two months . " 130 " You 're young . Impulsive too . When you feel something , you feel strongly , do n't you ? I can tell . And you 've made some sweeping judgments in those two months , have n't you ? " I could feel my cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that ? " I suppose I have made some judgments . But some things are obvious enough , " I added stubbornly . " Like cabins and yards so dirty and so smelly that I lost my supper after one visit . " Suddenly the Doctor threw back his head and laughed . It was a deep rumbling laugh that rippled over his entire body . At the moment my sense of humor was missing . " Dr. MacNeill , a queasy stomach may seem funny to you . You 've been trained to stand anything . But the sights and sounds that made me lose my supper are n't funny . They really are n't . " " Forgive me . But if you could have seen your own face ! When your nose wrinkled up , I could just see some of the sights you were remembering . " He was still chuckling . " I know it 's bad  --  but these people ca n't be changed all at once . They have their own timing . The pace is slower back in these hills than outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week . He was talking to me about the Great Northern Lumber Company trying to buy up land  --  a man was up here last fall looking around . All the trouble them outlanders are makin ' for us tryin ' to git our land , that ai n't so bad by itself , ' Uncle Bogg said . But hits comin ' right on top of the War Between the States that seems more'n we can stand . ' " In spite of my annoyance , I could n't help laughing , and the tension between us relaxed . Yet , I was thinking , how odd that for the highlanders time moves that slowly . Ever since I 've been in the Cove , for me it has been just the opposite . Is it because this seems such a new world and I 'm having so many new experiences so fast ? Like the way time telescoped for me when father took our family on that four-day holiday to New York City . We made every minutecount and packed so much living into a brief time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in New York only four days . Again , the Doctor pulled me away from my thoughts by a131change of mood . " Resistance to change is n't all . We 've worse problems than dirt and smells back here . How much do you know about the murders back in these mountains ? " " Not much . Several people have hinted at it , that 's all . " " You do n't know the Taylor-Allen story ? " I shook my head . " In my father 's time , the spring of ' 79 it was , Otis Allen was murdered by MacKinley Taylor . It was a land boundary dis- pute . Involved Coldsprings , one of the best springs in these mountains . I wo n't go into details , they 're too involved . But since then nine men have been killed , three since I 've been prac- ticing . Oh , we 've got things patched up enough  --  mostly Miss Henderson 's doing  --  so that Allen and Taylor children are both going to your school . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , there 's a couple other side Raven Mountain who have n't spoken to one another in twenty-six years . " " You mean , they 're divorced ? " " No ! That 's my point . They 've lived together in the same cabin all that time . Lived together as man and wife and have had seven children . The mother will say to one of the children , Liz , tell yer Paw for me . . . ' Then the father will send his re- ply back by Liz . They think it 's a virtue , a mark of strong char- acter , to carry a grudge to the grave . " He looked at me and laughed . " Your eyes are very expressive , Miss Huddleston . They tell me you do n't believe me . " " Well , I  --  " " It 's true though . And that 's why rooting out the grudges and the hates that lead to killings is even more pressing than sanitation . " " Are these what you 'd call feuds ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feuding district like some other sections . " " But still , Dr. MacNeill , you 're a doctor . Stopping killings is n't your job . That 's the law 's job . " " Sure . But out of nine murders and several woundings , no- body 's been convicted . " " How did they get off ? " 132 " Lots of angles to it . In these mountains , family loyalty comes before everything else  --  including the law . It 's Jacobite Scotlandand Tudor England all over again . In the eyes of the mountaineers , the courts are always unfair , slanted toward one side or the other . So when the state ca n't insure real justice , they think that private war , ambush , assassination , murder  --  are justified . " " But that 's ridiculous about the courts being unfair . This is twentieth-century America , not Tudor England . " " It is n't as silly as you think , not when families plot for years to get one of their clan elected a judge , sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury , the jurors put family loyalty ahead of everything else too . So do all the witnesses . " I sat there trying to take in a lot of new ideas at once . " But then there 's another reason why murderers get off around here , " the Doctor went on . " The El Pano district , the Old Twelfth , has a county squire who 's ruled this county for eighteen years and there has n't been a sentence for murderin all that time . There are ways and ways of seeing that nobodyever gets convicted . " " Who 's the squire ? " " Uncle Bogg McHone . " " You ca n't be serious ! " I was shocked and made no effort to hide it . " He seems like a harmless , likable old man . " " I know . And he has his own brand of chivalry . And I like him too . Yet I 'm serious , quite serious . " " But Dr. MacNeill , you said everybody in the Cove takes sides . Why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side from his family and friends to be brought to justice ? " " Because he subscribes wholeheartedly to the view that our family quarrels are our own business , to be resolved in our own way outside the courts . If he did n't feel that way , he 'd never have gotten elected  --  and then re-elected seventeen times . " " I never heard anything so tangled . " " Yet I have n't told you a fraction of all the ins and outs . " ' I'he Doctor walked over to look out the front window . " I think we began this conversation when you challenged me in a pert , feminine way about my lack of reforming zeal about sanitation133and superstitions . If you 'd really like to see some reform , stoppingthe hate and feuding and killing is a fertile field for your mission . " There was a note of something close to contempt in his voice . He had said " your mission " as if it was far removed from his sphere of activity . " I take it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on . " Besides , I agree with you that it would sure be pleasant to spend some time teaching mothers how to take care of babies instead of probing for bullets in lungs , suturing slashed abdomens , operating on eyes half gouged out . " While he heated some coffee in an old white enamelware coffeepot and we drank it , the Doctor talked on about some of the families in the Cove , telling me story after story , some of them gruesome , many of them funny . When we heard a light rap on the door and David walked in , I was startled that so much time had passed . After I had dressed again in my own clothes and as we were leaving Dr. MacNeill 's cabin , David said , " Theo will mind me better , so I 'll ride him and you take Prince . " " But  --  " " No buts . You 'll be safe enough if you ride astride . No , not a word , I insist . Safety before modesty . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is n't a split skirt  --  " " Does n't matter . Anyway , I already know what a woman 's leg looks like . " Actually I did feel more sure of myself not riding sidesaddle . We got back across Big Spoon Creek without any problems and onto the trail for home . Along the edge of the ridge , the path was wide enough that David and I could ride side by side . I was letting David do most of the talking ; my thoughts were still on what Dr. MacNeill had told me . How could the Cutter Gap that the Doctor had picturedbe the same place that Dr. Ferrand had talked about that day from the platform in Montreat ? What did Miss Alice think about all of these murders ? And how much of all this did David134know ? He had seemed so friendly with Uncle Bogg . Did he know about the old man 's obstructing justice ? Finally I broke into my own thoughts to ask David . " I know enough , " was his answer . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For your comfort , those who mind their own business and do n't take sides are usually safe enough . But the Doc is right about the mission 's responsibility . My mind 's been wrestling with this . I may have to rip open the subject from the pulpit soon . " " But that wo n't exactly be minding your own business . That could be  --  well  --  " " Dangerous ? Sure . I know . " " David , about Dr. MacNeill . . . I was glad of the chance to know him better this afternoon . But after all his explanations , I still do n't see how he can go in and out of these cabins year after year and leave them in as bad shape as always . He 's a strange one . I do n't think I like him . " " That 's not fair , Christy . You women judge too quickly . Do n't be fooled about the Doc because he does n't wear a white shirt and a collar and tie . I 've spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . His ancestors were as distinguished a family as ever came out of Scotland  --  the MacNeills of the Islandof Barra . Their ancestral castle is still there . Pry the story out of the Doctor some time  --  or get Alice Henderson to tell you . " ElevenFOUR of Miss Ida 's hot buckwheat cakes , six  --  David was enjoying his breakfast . I poured him a second cup of coffee . " When you have something important to say to a man , " my mother had always advised , " never say it to a hungry one . Wait until he 's had a good meal . " Well then , now should be the moment . " David , " I plunged in , " I 've gotten notice of some shipments135at Lyleton and El Pano  --  for the mission , I mean . " I tried to sound casual . " What kind of shipments ? " His black eyebrows lifted . Already he was wary . This was hard . For days now I had been trying to think of a way to soften @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way at all to make the shipment of a concert grand piano and a Har- vester wagon sound  --  well , usual . " Oh , just a few things . " I looked away from him , traced the pattern in the tablecloth with the tip of one finger . " A wagon and uh  --  a grand piano . " " A what ? " " No need to get upset , David . " " Now let 's begin all over . " He pushed his chair back from the table , crossed his legs and looked at me . " Will you get that pleading look out of those big eyes of yours ? Now whatin- thunder is this about ? " " Sort of a long story . I got the idea of writing to some businessmen , a nice letter , really nice , telling them about the mission and giving them a chance to help by donating products rather than money . " " Giving them a chance , ' she says . That 's turning things around . " " But , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them would respond ? I never expected the Lyon and Healy Company to come through . And if they did , I was thinking of an upright , not a grand piano . Let alone a concert grand . " David grimaced , put his head in his hands , laughed shakily , and then started probing and prodding and pulling the truth out of me bit by bit . " How many letters have you writ- ten , Christy ? " " Thirty-eight . " " How many replies have you gotten so far ? " " Ah , let me think  --  twenty-one . " " And are all of these firms donating something ? " " All but one . One flat refusal . " " I see . What kind of stuff are they sending other than wagon beds and concert grand pianos ? " " Oh , mattresses , soap , paints , windowshades , soup . " 136Poor David got his answers soon enough . For the next few weeks , hauling freight out from El Pano took most of his time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David had to borrow a team of oxen to get the wagon sent by the IntcrnationalHarvester Company out to the Cove . Yet the wagon proved to be invaluable . It arrived in the mission yard piled high with cartons and boxes . Soon Miss Ida was complaining loudly that she could not get around the kitchen because of the cases of soup , evaporated milk , baked beans , and cocoa that had piled up . " We have enough Pincine baking powder and Plymouth Rock gelatin and Wizard furniture polish to last the rest of our lives . Miss Huddlestonhas been most efficient . Too bad while she was about it , she did n't ask for a warehouse to store the stuff . David , " she fumed , " you 've got to find somewhere else to dump all this para-phernalia . " But the back porch was already heaped high with the cartonsof pins , insulators , and the wire from the telephone company . A lot of wire was needed for seven miles . Besides , David would pay no attention to what he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He escaped the tension in the house by staying busy each day hauling out more freight . Then the piano arrived , the largest and most elaborate concertgrand made by Lyon and Healy . It took two pairs of oxen hitched to the new wagon to pull it . David and three of the mountain men spent two days of hard work getting the huge instrument over the rutted roads across the mountains . But the piano was given a place of honor in the big , almost empty living room and was to prove a delight to all of us . At supper the day the piano arrived , Miss Ida commented waspishly , " Christy Huddleston , you 're sure going to get the beggar 's reward when you get to heaven . " David laughed but I noticed that Miss Alice did not . " As a matter of fact , Christy , " she said seriously , " Dr. Ferrand does n't like begging . " Miss Ida pursed her lips primly as if to say , " I told you so ! " " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fund-raising , " Miss Alice went on , not noticing her at137 all . " David , you should know this too . He loathes even the term raising money . ' Whenever he makes a talk about the work  --  and believe me , that 's usually several times a week  --  he wo n't even let anyone take a collection afterwards . The point is , Dr. Ferrand wo n't accept any money unless he knows the individual has had inner direction to give it . He feels that money dunned out of people wo n't be blessed for the work anyway . " These were new ideas to me but I respected them . In fact , in the light of such a philosophy of giving , now I thought I saw what was wrong with the never-ending plea for funds from charitable organizations and pulpits : most of the time these solicitors were trying to pry money out of people by riding roughshod over their individual right of choice . But Miss Alice continued , " I believe each person has some- thing special he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have no right to foist causes '  --  even our favorite ones  --  only present them . Dr. Ferrand believes  --  and I agree  --  that only one motive is good enough to warrant giving : because the self , with- out pressure , freely chooses to make the gift . " As we left the table , Miss Alice took my arm and led me to the far corner of the living room . " Christy , as much as we need these supplies , I 'm forced to say this to you . All those letters you wrote could place the mission in a bad light . And Dr. Fer- rand does have the right to be consulted about policy and pro- cedure . So do the rest of us on the staff . I honestly do n't think this going ahead on your own was even good teamwork . " I nodded , gulped back several explanations , but I knew she was right . I did sometimes pull away and go running off on my own . David 's attitude about the telephone underscored her point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wires and install the telephones , he felt that I might at least have talked it over with him before writing the Bell Company . On my side , I had just thought that if David could build a school- house-church , he would have no problem installing one or two little telephones . " It has to be connected up , you know . Two ends , something to carry the voice . " There was mild irritation and a trace of sar- casm in David 's voice . " The wire has to be strung across PebbleMountain , then across Coldsprings Mountain  --  that 's even higher  --  over Allen 's Branch , across the French Broad River . How do I get the wire across a river ? Tell me that . " Woefully , I acknowledged that I had n't the least idea . I had been too eager , astonishingly impulsive and thoughtless . After my rebuke from Miss Alice I was abject about it . But that did not stop the boxes and barrels from continuing to arrive . Evening after evening we pulled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least " plunder " was the way Ruby Mae thought of it ; she was certain that Christmas had come to stay . One evening it was several boxes of secondhand books and clothing from my Asheville church . Miss Alice was there because she was more tolerant of this type of contribution  --  probably , I thought , because she was accustomed to missionary barrels . Ruby Mae was sitting cross-legged on the floor , her brown eyes dancing with excitement . Miss Ida was close to an oil lamp , darning her brother 's socks . At my insistence , David unpacked the books first , and eagerly we scanned the titles . On the whole , they were fine ; most could be used at the school . What a relief to have some books ! Then David got the lid pried off the first barrel and began pulling out the secondhand clothes . He held up a party dress of stiff gray silk , heavily beaded . " Oh-h ! It 's beau-ti-ful . " Ruby Mae reached out eager fingers for it . She held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her long red hair flying . " Perfect for hoeing  --  or carrying water from the spring , " was David 's dry retort . " Look what we have next  --  " and he pulled out a pink corset with many stays and long strings . We women chose to ignore that , but David , teasingly , draped it prominently over the edge of the barrel . Next came a swallowtailcoat and several voluminous nightshirts and then a series of ladies ' hats . One was black velvet shaped like a gigantic boat , heavy with once-white aigrette feathers . Another was a soiled pink , layer upon layer of ribbon , the whole swathed in yards of mauve veiling. **25;8595;TOOLONG in a most extraordinary way .

I 've spent the last few days prowling about the Academy and it 's a most expensive creation , worth millionsI should say , and half of it 's mine , or at least half the ground it stands on . I have already contacted a good lawyerand presently he will surprise Buck Loner with my claims . Our case , I am assured , is airtight . I find Buck Loner something of an enigma . No man can be as cheerful as he seems to be , as desirous of creatinglove as he says he is . Yet it is true that oceans of warmth flow from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to adore him , even those who are known as " hippies " and mock everyone ( the argot is curiously rich out here , and slightly repellent : teenagers  --  already a ghastly word  --  are known as " teenyboppers " ! ) . Reluctantly , I find myself admiring the man ,  |p26monster  though he is . But then I shall soon break him to my will . Is there a man alive who is a match for Myra Breckinridge ?  |p27I  sit now in a bus on my way to Culver City  --  and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ! My heart is beating so quickly that I can hardly bear to look out the window for fear that suddenly against that leaden horizon marked by oil derricks , I shall behold  --  like some fantastic palace of dreams  --  the Irving Thalberg Memorial Building and its attendant sound stages whose blank ( but oh so evocative ! ) facades I have studied in photographs for twenty years . Not wanting to spoil my first impression , I keep my eye on this notebook which I balance on one knee as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , simplyanything in order to save for myself the supreme moment of ecstasy when the Studio of Studios , the sublime motor to this century 's myths , appears before me as it has so many times in dreams , its great doors swinging wide to welcome Myra Breckinridge to her rightful kingdom.  |p28I  was born to be a star , and look like one today : a false hairpiece gives body to my hair while the light Max Factorbase favored by Merle Oberon among other screen lovelies makes luminous my face even in the harsh light of a sound stage where I shall soon be standing watching a take . Then when the director says , " O.K. , print it , " and the grips prepare for another setup , the director will notice me and ask my name and then take me into the commissary and there , over a Green Goddess salad ( a favoriteof the stars ) , talk to me at length about my face , wondering whether or not it is photogenic until I stop him with a smile and say : " There is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To be a film star is my dearest daydream . After all , I have had some practical experience in New York . Myron and I both appeared in a number of underground movies . Of course they were experimental films and like most experiments , in the laboratory and out , they failed but even had they succeeded they could never have been truly Hollywood , truly mythic . Nevertheless , they gave me a sense of what it must be like to be a star . This trip is endless . I hate buses . I must rent or buy a car . The distances are unbelievable out here and to hire a taxi costs a fortune . This particular section of town is definitely ratty-looking with dingy bungalows and smogfilledair ; my eyes burn and water . Fortunately elaborate neon signs and an occasional eccentrically shaped buildingmake magic of the usual . We are now passing a diner in the shape of an enormous brown doughnut . I feel betteralready . Fantasy has that effect on me . What to make of the students ? I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sit down without knocking over furniture ) and two in Empathy ( I invite them to pretend they are oranges , drinks of water , clouds . . . the results are unusual , to say the least ) . Though I have nothing to do with the Speech Department , I could not help but notice what difficulty most of the students have in talking . The boys tend to bark while the girls whine through their noses . Traditional human speech seems to have passed them by , but then one must never forget that they are the first creations of that televisionculture which began in the early Fifties . Their formative years were spent watching pale gray figures ( no blacks , no whites  --  significant detail ) move upon a twenty-one-inch screen . As a result , they are bland and inattentive , responsive only to the bold rhythms of commercials . Few can read anything more complex than a tabloid newspaper . As for writing , it is enough that they can write their name , or " autograph " as they are encouraged to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a touch of literary genius ( that never dies out entirely ) , witness the obscene graffiti on the men 's bathroomwall into which I strayed by accident the first day and saw , in large letters over one of the urinals , " Buck Sucks . " Can this be true ? I would put nothing past a man who traffics so promiscuously in love , not knowing that it is hate alone which inspires us to action and makes for civilization . Look at Juvenal , Pope , Billy Wilder . In the Posture class I was particularly struck by one of the students , a boy with a Polish name . He is tall with a great deal of sand-colored curly hair and sideburns ; hep30has pale blue eyes with long black lashes and a curving mouth on the order of the late Richard Cromwell , so satisfyinglytortured in Lives of a Bengal Lancer . From a certainunevenly rounded thickness at the crotch of his blue jeans , it is safe to assume that he is marvelously hung . Unfortunately he is hot for an extremely pretty girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs and breasts , reminiscent of Lupe Velez . She is mentally retarded . When I asked her to rise she did not recognize the word " rise " and so I had to ask her " to get up " which she did understand . He is probably just as stupid but fortunately has the good sense not to talk too much . When he does , however , he puts on a hillbilly accent that is so authentic that I almost melt in my drawers . " I thank we gawn git on mahty fahn , Miz Myra " were his first words to me after class as he looked down into my upturned face , confident of his masculine primacy . He was , in fact , so close to me that I could smell the most appetizing odor of deodorant mingled with tobacco and warm boy . But before I could make a suitable answer , she pulled him away . Poor child ! She does n't know that I shall have him in the end whilep31I can hardly bear it another moment ! I am reborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here Comes Mr. Jordan . I am seated in front of a French cafe in a Montmartre street on the back lot at Metro . Last year 's fire destroyed many of the studio 's permanent outdoor sets  --  those streets and castles I knew so much better than ever I knew the Chelsea area of Manhattan where Myron and I used to exist . I deeply regret the fire , mourn all that was lost , particularly the famous New York City street of brownstones and the charming village in Normandy . But , thank Heaven , this cafe still stands . Over a meta ! framework , cheap wood has been so arranged and painted as to suggest with astonishing accuracy a Paris bistro , complete with signs for BYRRH , while a striped awning shades metal tables and chairs set out on the " sidewalk . " Any minute now , I expect to see Parisians . I would certainly like to see a waiter and order a Pernod.  |p32I  can hardly believe that I am sitting at the same table where Audrey Hepburn once awaited Gene Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for myself the lights , the camera , the sound boom , the technicians , all converged upon this one table where , in a blaze of artificialsunlight , Audrey  --  much too thin but a lovely face with eyes like mine  --  sits and waits for her screen lover while a man from makeup delicately dusts those famous features with powder . From the angle where I sit I can see part of the street in Carvel where Andy Hardy lived . The street is beautifullykept up as the shrine it is , a last memorial to all that was touching and  --  yes  --  good in the American past , an era whose end was marked by two mushroom shapes set like terminal punctuation marks against the Asian sky . A few minutes ago I saw Judge Hardy 's house with its neatly tended green lawn and windows covered with muslin behind which there is nothing at all . It is quite eerie the way in which the houses look entirely real from every angle on the slightly curving street with its tall green trees and flowering bushes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , one sees the rusted metal framework , the unpainted wood which has begun to rot , the dirty glass of the windows and the muslin curtainssoiled and torn . Time withers all things human ; althoughyesterday evening when I saw Ann Rutherford , stopped in her car at a red light , I recognized immediatelythe great black eyes and the mobile face . She at least endures gallantly , and I could not have been more thrilled ! Must find where Lewis Stone is buried.  |p33This  is the happiest moment of my life , sitting here alone on the back lot with no one in sight , for I was able to escape the studio guide by telling him that I wanted to lie down in an empty office of the Thalberg Building ; then of course I flew straight here to the back lot which is separated from the main studio by a public road . If only Myron could have seen this ! Of course he would have been saddened by the signs of decay . The spirit of what used to be has fled . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lot ; and that means that the twenty-seven huge sound stages which saw the creation of so many miracles : Gable , Garbo , Hepburn ( Katharine ) , Powell , Loy , Garland , Tracy and James Craig are now empty except for a few crews makingtelevision commercials . Yet I must write the absolute truth for I am not MyronBreckinridge but myself and despite the intensely symbiotic relationship my husband and I enjoyed during his brief life and despite the fact that I do entirely supporthis thesis that the films of 1935 to 1945 inclusive were the high point of Western culture , completing what began that day in the theatre of Dionysos when Aeschylus first spoke to the Athenians , I must confess that I part company with Myron on the subject of TV . Even before Marshall McLuhan , I was drawn to the gray shadows of the cathode tube . In fact , I was sufficiently avant-garde in 1959 to recognize the fact that it was no longer the movies but the television commercial that engagedthe passionate attention of the world 's best artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this new world , like it or not , we are liv/ing in : post-Gutenberg and pre-Apocalypse . For almost twenty years the minds of our children have been filled with dreams that will stay with them forever , the way those maddening jingles do ( as I write , I have begun softly to whistle " Rinso White , " a theme far more meaningfulculturally than all of Stravinsky or even John Cage ) . I submitted a piece on this subject to the Partisan Review in the summer of 196o . I believe , without false modesty , that I proved conclusively that the relationship between consumer and advertiser is the last demonstration of necessary love in the West , and its principal form of expression is the television commercial . I never heard from PR but I kept a carbon of the piece and will incorporateit into the book on Parker Tyler , perhaps as an appendix . For almost an hour I watched a television commercial being made on the same stage where Bette Davis acted in The Catered Affair  --  that predictably unhappy result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should have taken over was the spirit of the commercials . Then I was given lunch in the commissary which is much changed since the great days when people in extraordinary costumes wandered about , creating the impression that one was inside a time machinegone berserk . Now television executives and techniciansoccupy all the tables and order what used to be Louis B. Mayer Chicken Soup only the name of Mayer has been , my guide told me , stricken from the menu . So much for greatness ! Even more poignant as reminders of human transiency are the empty offices on the second floor of the Thalberg Building . I was particularly upsetp35to see that the adjoining suites of Pandro S. Berman and the late Sam Zimbalist were both vacant . Zimbalist ( immortalbecause of Boom Town ) died in Rome while producingBen Hur which saved the studio 's bacon , and Pandro S. Berman ( Dragon Seed , The Picture of Dorian Gray , The Seventh Cross ) has gone into what the local trade papers refer to as " indie production . " How tragic ! MGM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its stars . No doubt about it , an era has indeed ended and I am its chronicler . Farewell . the classic films , hail the television commercial ! Yet nothing human that is great can entirely end . It is merely transmuted  --  in the way that the wharf where Jeanette MacDonald arrived in New Orleans ( Naughty Marietta , 1935 ) has been used over and over again for a hundred other films even though it will always remain , to those who have a sense of history , Jeanette 's wharf . Speaking of history , there was somethingcuriously godlike about Nelson Eddy 's recent death before a nightclub audience at Miami . In the middle of a song , he suddenly forgot the words . And so , in that plangentbaritone which long ago earned him a permanent place in the pantheon of superstars , he turned to his accompanistand said , " Play Dardanella , ' and maybe I 'll remember the words . " Then he collapsed and died . Play " Dardanella " ! Play on ! In any case , one must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remind us that once there were gods and goddesses in our midst and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ( where I now sit ) preserved their shadows for all time ! Could the actual Christ have possessed a fraction of the radiance and thep36mystery of H. B. Warner in the first King of Kings or revealed , even on the cross , so much as a shadow of the moonstruck Nemi-agony of Jeffrey Hunter in the secondKing of Kings , that astonishing creation of Nicholas Ray ?  |p37Seated  at a table in the Academy cafeteria . It is three weeks to the day since I arrived . People want to sit with me , but I graciously indicate that I would rather make these notes . They respect my writing at odd times in public places . There is a rumor that I am with the CIA . While waiting just now to be served today 's lunch specialty , a chili con carne that looks suspiciously like Gravy Train , a concentrated dog food which **28;8622;TOOLONG Mexicans mix with their beans , I noticed , as always with a certain pleasure , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful girl called Gloria Gordon holds court at one table , wearing a silver lame evening gown , cut to the navel , while rock-and-roll singers do an impromptu number in the center of the room , to the delight of the western stars in their boots and chaps ; a pleasure not shared by the motorcyclists in their black leather , bedecked with swastikas and chains , radiatingp38hostility , so unlike the Easterners who are solemnly catatonicin their Brooks Brothers suits and button-down collars , each clutching an empty attache case . The students regard the Easterners respectfully as being the farthestoutof all for they are , reputedly , the drug-takers . Of course all the students smoke pot and experiment with LSD but only a few main-line , and of those few the Easterners , to a man , are thought to be totally hooked . As a spiritual child of the Forties , I can not give my imprimatur to this sort of behavior . The drug-taker is a passivist . I am an activist . Yet  --  to be fair  --  how can the average person make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is very little of interest for him to do in the way of work , while sex is truly absorbingonly for those who possess imagination as well as means . With these young people one has the sense that they know instinctively that there are plenty more where they came from and so why fuss ? They 'll soon be gone , their places taken by others so closely resembling them that only a mother 's eye could tell the difference . They are an anonymous blur , even to themselves , which explains their fitful , mindless shuffling of roles . In the morning Gloria will wear a silver lame gown completewith Miriam Hopkins cocktail shaker ; in the eveningher ensemble may consist of leotards and a sunbonnet . It is easy for these young people to be anything since they are so plainly nothing , and know it . Their metamorphoses , however , seldom involve more than a change of clothes and the affecting of certain speech mannerisms , appropriated from Western or Eastern stars ofp39television series , liberally sprinkled with jokes told late at night on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in youth , and my only demur is that today 's models are , by and large , debasing . In the Forties , American boys created a world empire because they chose to be James Stewart , Clark Gable and William Eythe . By imitating godlike autonomous men , our boys were able to defeat Hitler , Mussolini and Tojo . Could we do it again ? Are the private eyes and denatured cowboys potent enough to serve as imperial exemplars ? No . At best , there is James Bond . . . and he invariably ends up tied to a slab of marble with a blowtorch aimed at his crotch . Glory has fled and only the television commercialsexist to remind us of the Republic 's early greatnessand virile youth . Of all the students at the Academy , only one has sought to model himself on a Forties star : the sickest of the Easterners is currently playing Humphrey Bogart , and he is hopeless in the part . The rest are entirely contemporary , pretending to be folk singers , cowboys and English movie actors . Needless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail . For one thing the accents are too much for them ; for another , any evidence that there could be a real world outside Southern California tends to demoralize our students . Of course they can observe other worlds on television but then that is show business and familiar . Even the Martian landscape of Southeast Asia loses all strangeness when framed by the homey plastic of a television set , while the people involved in that war are quite plainly extras luckyp40enough to be called upon to fill in prime airtime with the appearance of people dying and living . Naturally , the Vietnam exercise appeals enormously to the students . " I mean , " said one of them , " if we do n't stop them there  --  you know , where they are now  --  they 'll be right here in L.A. " To which I answered , " This city could not be worse run by the Chinese than it is by the present administration and , frankly , if the Chinesecould be persuaded to take on the job  --  which is doubtful  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange , Myra Breckinridge has been thought by some to be a Commie , not the worst thing to be known as at the Academy since the students are scared to death of Communism ( like , man , they make you work ! ) , and so regard any alleged conspirator or sympathizerwith awe . . . which I like . As for the theory of Communism , they have not a clue . In fact , the only book any of them has read is something called The Green Berets , a jingoistic work written in the spirit of Kipling with the art of Mickey Spillane . Apparently this work is a constant source of sadistic reveries . Time and again have I heard the students speak wistfully of fighting and torturingthe Vietcong , or rather of other young men fightingand torturing the Vietcong on their behalf . Not only are the male students drawn to violence ( at second hand ) , they are also quite totalitarian-minded , even for Americans , and I am convinced that any attractive televisionpersonality who wanted to become our dictator would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the one hand , I am intellectuallydevoted to the idea of the old America . I believep41in justice , I want redress for all wrongs done , I want the good life  --  if such a thing exists  --  accessible to all . Yet , emotionally , I would be only too happy to become world dictator , if only to fulfill my mission : the destruction of the last vestigial traces of traditional manhood in the race in order to realign the sexes , thus reducing populationwhile increasing human happiness and preparing humanity for its next stage . No doubt this tension in me constitutes my uniqueness , and genius . Certainly everyone senses it . Students flock to my lectures . Craving my attention and advice , they giggle , fascinated and frightened , at what I say . They sense my power , particularly the boys who are drawn to it even as they fear it . Of course these students are not entirely typical of the nation . They are somewhatstupider than the average , while simultaneously rather more imaginative and prone to daydreaming . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the truest sense : the unfamiliar alarms them and since they have had no experience outside what Dr. Montag calls their " peer group , " they are , consequently , in a state of near-panic most of the time , reacting against almost everything . It was Myron who observed in 1964 that all of the male hustlers were supporting Goldwater for President . He wrote a fascinating analysis of this phenomenonand sent it to the ADA , but received no reply.  |p42There  is no denying the fact that Mary-Ann Pringle of Winnipeg is an attractive girl and I plainly dislike the fact since I am jealous of all women though I do not need ' to be . But then envy is the nature of the human beast and one must face that fact , like all facts . For instance , is it a fact that in my Posture class I have been unnecessarilycruel to Rusty , her boyfriend ? Yes . I have been cruel . One must never lie to oneself or , for that matter , to others . No truth should ever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Essentially , each of us is nothing but a flux of sensations and impressions that only sort themselves out as a result of the most strict analysis and precise formulation , as RobbeGrillethas proposed but not accomplished ( his efforts to revive the novel as an art form are as ineffective as his attempts to destroy the art of film are successful ) . Of course , a true naming of things is impossible . Our minds are too feeble and our sensory equipment is too mys.  |p43terious  and complex for us ever to do more than make approximate definitions . Yet we must continue to make the effort , no matter how inadequate the result . In fact , I have made it a rule that whatever I consciously experience , I promptly submit to analysis . Take Mary-Ann Pringle . I was in my office , just after lunch , looking over my notes for tomorrow 's class in Empathy , when there was a timid knock at the door ( despite my vow never to make anthropomorphic references in referring to things there was no doubt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was the result of a fist striking wood directed by a frightened i.e. timid intelligence ) . Mary-Ann entered , wearing miniskirt ( bright yellow ) and sweater ( dark green ) and no bra . She is innocent , attractive , young . Her hands are those of a child , rather grubby with broken nails but marvelously smooth , like seamless gloves . " Miss Myra , I wanted to know could I talk to you just a minute . I 'm not disturbing you , am I , Miss Myra ? " As much as I dislike girls , particularly beautiful young ones , I found myself experiencing an emotion which might be called maternal . I promptly stifled it but was kind . " Of course you 're not disturbing me , Mary-Ann . My door is always open to you . Sit down . A cigarette ? A Coke ? " I realized too late that I was playing Gail Patrick and would have to continue flashing brilliant smiles for the remainder of the two-scene since I seldom abandon a role once I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the unappreciative Mary-Anns ofp44this world . I would have been much happier playing a sad but compassionate Loretta Young but since I had begunas Gail Patrick I would so remain , grinning doggedly . After many soft hesitancies , she came to the point : my treatment of Rusty . " You see , he 's real sensitive underneath . Oh , I know he does n't look it being so strong and playing football one year pro and everything , but he 's got feelings like anybody else and when you said that he walked like an ape with fleas , ' well , he was pretty darned upset and so was I. " I looked grave through my smile , not an easy thing to do . " Oh , I 'm sorry to hear that . Truly I am . I only wanted to help . And he does have terrible posture . " " It 's this old football accident he was too shy to tell you about which broke four ribs and when they healed he was sort of ass . . . assy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , sort of curved to one side . I mean it 's not noticeable except when he 's nervous and trying to walk straight and you 're staring at him and picking on him . " " You make me very , very ashamed , Mary-Ann . " I sounded extraordinarily sincere even to my own ears . " He seems like such a strong confident young man that I never dreamed he was so sensitive . " " Well , he is about some things . Like that . " Mary-Ann looked so forlorn , so touching , so young , so entirely attractivethat it was all I could do to keep from taking her in my arms  --  a gesture bound to be misinterpreted ! Instead I assured her that I would try to curb my natu/ral impatience in the future . Nevertheless , she must realize that in the teacher-student relationship one must always tell the total truth . In this case , though Rusty does walk like an ape with fleas , I am duty bound to add that his other bodily movements are often remarkably graceful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which seems never to desert him , exceptin class when I draw attention to his defects . So I will , I vowed , remember in the future to mix censure with deserved praise . She was pleased and grateful . Lovely Mary-Ann . Is she as stupid as she seems ?  |p46I  had just returned from Empathy II when Buck surged into my office ; there is no other verb to describe his entrance . Wearing the white Stetson that is his trademarkand the well-cut tweeds that reveal his true businessman'sidentity , Buck entirely filled the room , his smile positively scarring the air , it was so broad , so happy , so ingenuous . " Well , li'l lady , you lookin ' reel good . " No , I must not attempt any further phonetic rendering of his speech which , in any case , shifts so rapidly from Cheyenne to Pomona that one could go mad trying to define its actual provenance . " The kids all love you . Honest they do . I 've been getting crackerjack reports from them , particularly in Empathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironed out , you will consider staying on . " He sank into the room 's only armchair and gave me a conspiratorial wink . " You got what it takes to be a fine teacher andp47helper to somebody like me , who 's ignorant as a yellow dog . " " Not so ignorant ! " Two could play at flattery . By the time I 'm finished with Buck Loner , he wo n't have the proverbial pot to piss in or my name is not Myra Breckinridge , at whose feet the proudest men have groveled , wincing beneath the lash of her scorn , whimpering for a chance to hold in their coarse arms her  --  my  --  fragile , too lovely for this world or at least their world , body . I am Woman . " But I will say that after a week of getting to know your students , I realize at last what overpopulationmeans . The brains have been bred out of the current generation . They are like the local oranges , all bright appearanceand no taste . " I meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair as though I had struck his great golden autumnal moonface . " Why , that 's very , very unfair , Myra . Very unfair indeed . " He seemed at a complete loss how to begin a defense . In any case , I did not give him time . " I realize the scandalousstate of the public school system in the United States as well as the effect television has had upon the mental processes of those whose childhood was spent staring at the box , and I accept the fact that these young people are a new breed who have gone beyond linear type in their quest for experience  --  knowledge ' does not seem to be the right word for what they 're after ; perhaps the easy buck ' says it all . . . no play on names intended . Anyway I find it extraordinarily difficult getting through to them even the simplest thought , but sincep48I am an American brought up during the great age of film , I want to believe that our culture is still alive , still able to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must conclude that what you have assembled here are the national dregs , the misfits , the neurotics , the daydreamers , the unrealists , the  --  in short  --  fuckups who form a significant minority in our culture , witness what happened November twenty-second , 1963 , at Dal-las ! " ' Well , that took the wind out of those sails . He absolutelyshrank into his chair , contracted before my eyes . The huge open face shut tight against my imperious gaze . Frankly I can think of no pleasure greater than to approach an open face and swiftly say whatever needs to be said to shut it . Myron disapproved of this trait in me but I believed then , as I do now , that if one is right , the unsayable must be said , and the faces that I temporarily shut will , in the long run , be better faces for the exercise . Buck slid not agree . " These boys and girls are a crosssectionof the youth of this country , no better , no worse . What they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Business School at Harvard is the overwhelming desire to be in show business , to have their names and faces known to all the world , to sec themselves beloved by strangers , and that , believe me , is the only truly gratifying life any human can have , once they get the bug , that is , like I did , and like they have . " " My dear Buck , " I addressed him warmly , a husky Jean Arthur note to my voice , " you are unusual . Unique . You were  --  are  --  a star . You were  --  and through thep49reruns of your old movies on TV , you still are , permanently  --  beloved . Long after these two bodies , yours and mine , have gone to dust and this room is gone , and these boys and girls have all grown old and died and their descendants come and gone , you will live . Buck Loner , the Singin ' Shootin ' Radio Cowboy , astride Sporko , will ride the ranges of the world 's imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never can be . " I had him there . My famous one-two , learned from Myron : first , excessive flattery with a grain of truth swathed in cultured nacre ; then the lethal puncheroo . His face reflected ecstasy and dismay . Myra 's round . " Well , honey , I see what you mean and it 's a real subtle point you got there . I mean , yes , I did make eighteenfeature-length oaters , that 's true , and that bastard lawyer of mine never put in one word in my contracts about future resale to the TV even though I once said to him , Sydney , there is going to be this TV just like there was radio and when it comes the Buck Loner features are going to be worth their weight in solid platinum . ' But he paid me no mind and . . . But that 's not what we were talking about . No . It was about the kids , yes . " He frowned . " Now they are good kids who for the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this country , and they hitchhike to sunny California in order that they might be stars , like me . They get jobs here and there to support themselves while they study at the Academy where we do our darnedest to bring out the creative potential of each and every one .. . " " Can the brochure , daddy , " I said , surprising myselfp50by the Fifties jargon that so amused Myron but rather repelled me . " You 're in business to make money , and you do . " He looked genuinely hurt . " Well now , honey , of course I am making money or I should say eking out an existence , real estate taxes being what they are in this high-type residential area . . . " Noticing the scorn in my face ( and realizing that I am on to his conning ) , he quickly got away from the ticklish subject of our mutual property . " Anyway , I genuinely want to see these boys and girls happy because  --  you may laugh and probably will  --  I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmospherehere where they are as much as possible screened from the harshness of the world , which they get quite enough of working as waitresses in drive-ins and so on , not to mention the unhappy often broken homes they come from . I try to give them the glamour and excitementof show business , of fame , of stardom without the pain of failure , the terrible ordeal of real-life show businesswhere so many hearts are broken every day , needlessly , but that 's the way it goes . Here at Ieast they are able to perform on our closed-circuit TV and then read the reviews in our school paper which are always good and constructive . They can cut discs which are played on our Muzak-type system . They have special courses in how to give interviews to the press which they can then read in the school magazine . In fact , until it was recently discontinued , our late-night closed-circuit TV talk show was as good as NBC 's , with our stars being interviewed by a fellow student , himself a star on the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , within these walls , more than a thousand young men and women with stars in their eyes are happy . " No doubt about it , he was most effective . When he spoke of hearts needlessly broken ( the sort of phrase Myron would have hooted at ) , I confess tears came to my eyes . For he was paraphrasing Betty Hutton after one of her many failures on television . She never had any luck , that girl . Possibly because she does not realize that she is a true goddess , as a result of all those pictures she made at Paramount during the Forties ; films in which she was the demonic clown , the drum majorette of Olympus or , as Parker Tyler puts it with his usual wisdom : " The Hutton comedienne is a persuasive hieroglyph that symbolizessomething deeply ingrained in modern morality : the commoner man 's subconscious impulse , when a girl evades or refuses a kiss , to knock her out , take it , and have done . " Never was Tyler more on the mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he saw straight through the strenuous clowning to the hard fact that American women are eager for men to rape them and vice versa ; and that in every American there is a Boston Strangler longing to break a neck duringorgasm . Ours is a violent race . Buck and I agreed to disagree . But though he is a fool , he is also a man of formidable character and persuasivenessand thus a dangerous antagonist . It will require all my genius to destroy him . . . and destroy him I must , for not only has he cheated me of Myron 's proper inheritance , he represents all that I detest in the post-Fortiesp52culture : a permissive slovenliness of mind and art . It is all like , like , like . . . " like help , " as the Californian said when he was drowning . They all use " like " in a way that sets my teeth on edge . Not that I am strict as a grammarian . I realize that a certain looseness of style is necessary to create that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of post-Gutenberg prose , if there is to be such a thing . But I do object to " like " because of its mindless vagueness . " What time is it , Rusty ? " " Like three o'clock , Miss Myra , " he said , after looking at his watch . He knew the exact time but preferred to be approximate . Well , I shall teach him to tell time among other things.  |p53BUCK  LONER REPORTS  --  Recording Disc No. 715  --  5 FebruaryFlagler and Flagler do nt seem to be getting much of anywhere with the case they say that Gertrudes will is in order leaving her share of the property to Myron and Myrons will though not made by a lawyer was duly witnessed and will stand up in court leaving everything to his wife Myra so half the property is hers according to law which strikes me as perfect injustice since if it wasnt for me there wouldnt be hardly any value at all to this land even though it is Westwood the lawyers sug gest I settle with her for the current going price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighborhood of two hundred thousand bucks which I am not about to pay also I got a hunch she is out for even bigger game for she has lately taken to making little jokes about what a swell team we make running the Academy I hate that woman and wish to God there was some way to get her out ofp54my hair once and for all Flagler and Flagler are now checking up to make sure she was really married to that fag nephew thats our only hope at this point proving she wasnt married or something meanwhile I cozy her along best I can period paragraph the tak ing of drugs is frowned upon by this institution not only is it illegal and injurious to the health but it has been known to be harmful to the performances of those performing while under the influence some thing along those lines I must write up for the paper before the vice squad gets on my ass any more than they are now its crazy with people murdering each other from one end of L A to the other all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot which does them a lot less harm than liquor well it is a nutty world and that is for sure period para graph do nt forget to tell Hilda to send me the new French Canadian masseuse on Monday they say she gives a super around the world and also knows about massage remember to pick up chutney for Bobbie Dean whos cooking curry tonightp55I have locked the bathroom door . Several people have tried to get in , including Rusty , but I call out to them , " Use the other john , " and they go away , doubtless thinkingthat I am in here with a man when actually I am simplytrying to get away from the party . I feel very odd . I just smoked one entire marijuana cigarette , something I have never done before . In the old days Myron and I used occasionally to take a drag on someone else 's joint but never an entire stick . I always thought that drugs had no effect on me but apparently I was wrong .

I , Myra Breckinridge , Woman , as I proceed in my long trailing robes across the desert . SuddenlyI catch sight of my lover , a priest who has given up hope of Heaven for my body . I throw out my arms and run toward him across the silvery sands ... .  |p56I  can hardly write . My eyes do n't focus properly but I must put down all my impressions exactly for they are extraordinarily intense and important . The door of perceptionhas swung open at last and now I know that what I always suspected was true is true , that time is space made fluid , that these miniskirts are too short for me ; that time is a knee made fluid . That is hell.  |p57A  terrible hangover , the result of mixing gin and marijuana , though pot is supposed not to leave one with any ill effect , unless of course that is simply a legend cultivatedby drug addicts . I am in my office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only with the greatest effort am I able to write these lines . My hands tremble . I feel quite ill . The party was given by one of the students in the Music Department , Clem or Clint something or other . I had never seen him before but yesterday morning Gloria Gordon ( who is in my Empathy I class ) told me that he gave marvelous " far-out " parties and that I would be welcome to come last night as he , Clem or Clint , had admiredme from a distance . So Laura came to Petrarch 's party , to put it stylishly , and got stoned out of her head . It was too humiliating and yet during those moments when I lay in that empty bathtub with the two rings , staring up at the single elee/tric light bulb , I did have the sense that I was at one with all creation . The notes I made under the influence do not begin to record what I was actually feeling , largely because I was forced to break them off when a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move or speak until shortly before dawn when Clem or Clint and Gloria broke the lock on the bathroom door and rescued me from my gaudy reveries . Fortunately , they took it all as a huge joke , but I am still humiliated at having got myself in such a situation , without dignity and finally without revelation , for in the light of day I find it difficult to believe in cosmic consciousness . In fact , this terrible hangover seems to me proof that the celebrated insights of the mystics are physiological , the result of a drastic reduction of sugar in the blood that goes to the brain . My brain , deprived of sugar for some hours last night , now feels as if it were full of an expanding fluid on the verge of seeking desperate egress through the top of a papier-mache skull . I did find the party interesting , at least in its early stages . Of those present , I was one of the oldest , which did nothing for my sense of security so laboriously achieved in those long sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laughing and chatting and , all in all , behaving not as a teacher but as just plain Myra Breckinridge , a beautiful woman not yet thirty . As a result , several of the young men showed a sexual interest in me but though I teased them and played the flirt , I did not allow any intimacies to occur or even indicate that they might be welcomed at some future time . I preferred to be Greer Garson , a gracious lady whose compassionate breastsp59were more suited to be last pillow for a dying youth than as baubles for the coarse hands of some horny boy . But sex does not appear to be the hangup with this crowd . They wear buttons which , among other things , accuse the Governor of California of being a Lesbian , the President of being God , and Frodo ( a character in a fairy tale by Tolkien ) of actually existing . This is all a bit fey for my taste . But one must be open to every experience and the young , in a sense , lead us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . But they are peculiar creatures , particularly to one brought up within the contextof the Forties . They are quite relaxed about sex ; not only do they have affairs with one another , they also attendorgies in a most matter-of-fact way , so unlike my generation with its belief in the highly concentrated sort of love that Leslie Howard felt for Ingrid Bergman in Intermezzo . Yet despite all this athleticism , their true interestsseem to be , in some odd way , outside sex . They like to sit for long periods doing nothing at all , just listening to music or to what they regard as music . They are essentially passive ; hence the popularity of pot . Of course , my generation ( chronologically , not spiritually ) began all this . We of the Fifties saw the beginning of Zen as a popular force . Certainly our Beats were nothing if not passive in their attitude to life and experience . They were always departing , never arriving . NeitherMyron nor I shared their pleasures or attitudes for we were , despite our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last moment in human history when it was possible to possess a total commitment to something outside oneself . I mean of course the war and the necessary elimina/tion of Hitler , Mussolini and Tojo . And I do not exaggeratewhen I declare that I would give ten years of my life if I could step back in time for just one hour and visit the Stage Door Canteen in Hollywood , exactly the way that Dane Clarke did in the movie of the same name , and like him , meet all the great stars at their peak and perhaps even , like Dane 's buddy Bob Hutton , have a romance with Joan Leslie , a star I fell hopelessly in love with while watching Sergeant York . But where is Joan now ? Where are all those beautiful years of war and sacrifice and PandroS . Berman films ? None of this will ever come again , except in gray cloudy miniatures on the Late Show , and soon , I pray , in the sinewy prose of Myra Breckinridge as she reworks and completes her late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forties . But what will the current generation think of my efforts ? That is the question . I find that any reference to the stars of the Forties bores them . " Who was Gary Cooper ? " asked one young thing last night ; to which anothergirl answered , " The one with the big ears , " thinkinghe was Clark Gable ! But they all find Humphrey Bogart fascinating and he may yet prove to be my bridge to them . Conversation from last night . " Like experience is n't everything , Myra . I mean like you also got to have it deep down inside you . " " But what is it ? " " What 's deep down inside you , that 's what it is . What you are . " " But is n't what you are what experience makes you ? " " No , it 's like what you feel ... "  |p61Like  . Like . Like ! The babble on this subculture is drowning me ! Although my companion was a lanky youth of the sort I am partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group that was dancing in the center of the room , a dozen boys and girls gyrating without touchingone another , each in his or her private world .. . which is the key to the game of the moment : do n't touch me and I wo n't touch you . While the operative word is " Cool . " Like fun ? Like crazy ! Of the dancers , Rusty Godowsky was easily the most exciting and certainly the most attractive , in his faded chinos and checked shirt , whose top two buttons were missing , revealing a smooth muscular neck at whose base , just below the hollows of the collarbone , tendrils of bronze hair curl , looking as if they would be silky to the touch , unlike the usual male Brillo . Soon I shall know for certain their texture . Poor Mary-Ann . " He does dance well , does n't he ? " Mary-Ann sat down in the place which the metaphysician had vacated , without , I fear , my noticing his departure . Obviously she had seen me watching Rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying him for posture . " I sounded colder than I intended , but she had taken me by surprise and I dislike it when people observe me without my knowledge . " I will say he moves very well when he dances , " I added with a degree of warmth which encouraged her to smile shyly . " That 's being an athlete . It 's just when he walks he sort of lumbers . " " Well , we 'll soon take care of that , " I said briskly , and indeed I shall , poor bastard.  |p62Mary-Ann  chattered away , unaware of my designs . " We 've been talking about maybe getting married in June after we finish the course  --  that is , if we can both get work . Of course I can always pick up a little money modeling . I 'm not really crazy about a career , you know . Fact , it 's just to be with Rusty that I 'm taking this music course , to keep an eye on him . With all these pretty girls around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances . " " You make a charming couple . " I noticed again how extraordinarily attractive she is , with that fresh uncloudedcomplexion I so love  --  and envy , for the texture of the skin of my face is not all that Helena Rubinstein would desire . In my day I have been too much a sunworshipperand the skin must pay a price for the spirit 's refreshment , and I was certainly refreshed by those long sunny afternoons at Jones Beach and amongst the Far Rockaways . Rusty 's back was to us now and I could not take my eyes off his somewhat square yet small buttocks as they made a slow grinding motion in response to the beat of an electric guitar . Though I tried to visualize what they must look like without the protective covering of cloth , I failed to come up with a satisfactory mental image . Happily , I shall soon know everything ! " ' Course we 're both broke . I get a little something from the family in Winnipeg but poor Rusty 's only got this uncle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was kind of wild when he was a kid . . . " " So wild that he was busted for stealing a car . " The day that I first noticed Rusty in class , I went straight to Buck 's office where dossiers on each student are kept.  |p63They  are surprisingly thorough . Rusty 's three-year suspendedsentence was duly noted , as well as the cogent fact that should he ever again run afoul of the law he can be sent up for a maximum of twenty years . Mary-Ann looked frightened . " I did n't know anybodyknew about that . " " Just Uncle Buck and I. " I patted her hand . " Do n't worry , neither of us is going to tell . " " He 's completely changed since those days , he really is . Why , in those days he used to play around with a lot of girls . You should have seen all the photographs he used to have ! But after he met me he stopped all that and now he is n't interested in anything except working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's going to be . " " He 's certainly no worse than the rest of them on television . " I was perfectly honest with her . " Of course he can hardly talk but neither can they . " " Oh , but he talks awfully well . It 's just he has some trouble with speaking lines but that takes lots of practice . Anyway what is important is that he comes over so real , and of course so sexy . You should have seen him on the closed-circuit TV last spring when he played the part of this crazy gunman . Oh , he was something ! " It was at that point that I was given marijuana by Clem or Clint , and the rest of the evening took on a religious tone.  |p64Feeling  somewhat better , I gave a great deal to my Empathy II class , and though I am now exhausted , I have at least gotten over my hangover . A letter from Dr. Montag cheered me up . He warns against depressions of the sort I have been prone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather obviously , that in lieu of analysis I must keep busy . Little does he dream just how busy I am ! Between my plot to entrap Rusty and my efforts to obtain my rightful share of the Academy , I have hardly a moment to devote to my life 's real work , completing Myron 's book . Fortunately the insightsgained during my visit to MGM are bound to add immeasurably to Myron 's text . Meanwhile , I have had a marvelous idea for a piece on Pandro S. Berman which Cahiers du Cinema ought to eat up . After all , with the exception of Orson Welles and Samuel Fuller , Berman is the most important film-maker of the Forties.  |p65I  spoke sharply to Rusty in Posture today . He shows no sign of improvement and I 'm afraid I was brutal . " You simply can not walk straight . " I imitated his slouchingwalk which is , in its way , extremely sensual but hardly suitable for the screen . He looked very angry and muttered something under his breath that I could not hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed as she begged me with her eyes to desist . " I will see you after class , Godowsky . " I was abrupt . " Things can not go on as they are , " I added ominously . I then gave the class a series of exercises in how to sit down , something that did not come easily to any of them . All the while observing , out of the corner of my eye , Rusty 's sullen face . My plot is working very nicely . After class , Rusty came to my office and sat on the straight chair beside the desk , listing to one side , legs wide apart . He was not in the least nervous . In fact , hep66was downright defiant , even contemptuous of me , so securedid he think himself in his masculine superiority . As usual , he wore a sport shirt with two missing buttons . Today , however , a T-shirt hid the chest from view . Faded blue jeans and desert boots completed the costume , and  --  as I have already noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they act out their simplemindedroles , hopefully constructing a fantasy world in order to avoid confronting the fact that to be a man in a society of machines is to be an expendable , soft auxiliary to what is useful and hard . Today there is nothing left for the old-fashioned male to do , no ritual testing of his manhood through initiation or personal contest , no physicalstruggle to survive or mate . Nothing is left him but to put on clothes reminiscent of a different time ; only in travesty can he act out the classic hero who was a law unto himself , moving at ease through a landscape filled with admiring women . Mercifully , that age is finished . Marlon Brando was the last of the traditional heroes and , significantly , even he was invariably beaten up in the last reel , victim of a society that has no place for the ancient ideal of manhood . Since Brando , there has been nothing except the epicene O'Toole , the distracted Mastroianni , and the cheerfully incompetent Belmondo . The roof has fallen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the age of Woman Triumphant , of Myra Breckinridge ! I began pleasantly , disarmingly . " Not long ago MaryAnntold me that I have a tendency to pick on you , Rusty . . . " " You sure do ... " " Do n't interrupt , please . " I was stern but pleasant , likep67Eve Arden . " If I have , it 's because I 'm trying to help you . I think you have great potential talent . How great I ca n't decide just yet , but unless you learn to walk properlythere 's not a chance in this world of your ever being a major star . " The reference to his talent pleased him ; the prophecy alarmed him . " Hell , Miss Myra , I do n't walk that bad . " " I 'm afraid you do . And look at the way you 're leaningto one side right now . You look like you 're about to fall out of the chair . " He straightened up and crossed his legs . " That better ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must be built up in order that his fall be the more terrible . " Yes . Now I realize that you have a physical problem . Mary-Ann told me about your back . " " I broke four ribs and even so finished the last half . " He was inordinately proud ; no doubt about it , a confidentyoung man . " Very admirable . Now I want you to stand up and walk first toward the door and then back here to me . " I could hear him murmur " Oh , shit " under his breath as he lumbered to his feet . Slowly he walked , or rather slouched , to the door and then returned and stood defiantlyin front of me , thumbs hooked in his belt . I noted for the first time how large and strong his hands are , hairlesswith unusually long thumbs . " O.K. ? " he asked . " Not O.K. " I studied him a moment . He was so close to me that my eyes were on a level with his belt buckle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your problemseems to go away when you dance . So , just as anp68exercise , I want you to do one of those stationary dances  --  I do n't know what they 're called . You know , like the one you were doing at the party . " " Dance ? Here ? Now ? " He looked puzzled . " But there 's no music . " " To be precise there never is music with those dances , just electronic noise . Nothing compared to the big sound of Glenn Miller . Anyway , all you need is a beat . You can keep time by snapping your fingers . " " I feel silly . " He scowled and looked suddenly dangerous , but I knew what I was about . " Go ahead . We have n't got all day . Start . " I snapped my fingers . Halfheartedly he did the same and slowly began to gyrate his hips . I found the effect almost unbearablyerotic . To have him all to myself , just three feet away , his pelvis revolving sexily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fingers growing less and less precise as his hands grew sweaty . I then instructedhim to turn around so that I could observe him from the rear . He did as he was told . Waves of lust made me dizzy as those strong deep buttocks slowly revolved . Have they ever been violated ? I can hardly bear the suspense . Finally , I told him he could stop . He did so , with obviousrelief . When he turned back to me , I noticed the curved upper lip was beaded with perspiration . In his dense masculine way , he too had felt the tension and perhapssuspected , instinctively , its origin and so knew fear . " I ca n't dance so good without music , " he mumbled , as if obscurely ashamed of the display he had been forced to make of himself.  | " You did very well . " I was brisk , even encouraging . " I think I may have a solution to our problem . All you need is something to remind you to stand straight . Where were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , below the heart . " Four was busted right here which is why I 'm kind of pulled over to this side . " " Let me see . " At first he seemed not to understand the question . " Like this , " he said , indicating the way in which he was listing to port . " No . No . " I was brusque . " Let me see your back . Take your shirt off . " He was startled . " But there 's nothing to see . . . . I mean the ribs are all inside me that was broken . " " I know where the ribs are , Rusty . " I was patient . " But I have to see the exact point where the muscle begins to pull you to one side . " There was no answer to this . He started to say somethingbut decided not to . Slowly he unfastened his belt and unhooked the top button of the blue jeans . Then he unbuttoned his shirt and took it off . The T-shirt was soaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , perhaps ( do I project ? ) , of terror . For the first time I saw his bare arms . The skin was very white ( no one out here goes to the beach in January even though it is quite sunny ) , with biceps clearly marked though not overdeveloped ; large veins ran the length of the forearms to the hands , always an excellent sign , and not unattractive since the veins were not blue but white , indicating skin of an unusual thickness , again ap70good sign . On the forearms coppery straight hairs grew . He paused as though not certain what to do next . I was helpful . " The T-shirt , too . I have n't got X-ray eyes . " Glumly he pulled the T-shirt over his head . I watched , fascinated by each revelation of his body . First the navel came into view , small and protruding . Just beneath it a line of dark slightly curly hairs disappeared inside the Jockey shorts which were now visible above the loosenedbelt . The shirt rose higher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I had seen the topmost branches of this tree of life at the pot party , now I saw the narrow roots slowly widening as the tree made its way to his neck ) . When the chest was entirely bared , his face was momentarily hidden in the folds of the damp T-shirt and so I was able to study , unobserved , the small rose-brown breasts , at the moment concave and unaroused . Then the T-shirt was wadded up and dropped onto the floor . Aware of my interested gaze , he blushed . Beginning at the base of the thick neck , the lovely color rose to the level of his eyes . Like so many male narcissists , he is , paradoxically , modest : he enjoys revealing himself but only on his own terms . A remark about his appearance was obviously called for and I made it . " You seem in very good condition . . . " " Well , I work out some , not like I ought to . . . used to . . . " He hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to twitch ever so slightly , revealing the absence of any fat or loosening of skin . " Now will you please face the wall , arms at your side ,  |p71with  your palms pressed against the wall as hard as you can . " Without a word , he did as he was told . The back was as pleasing as the front ( no hairs on the shoulder , unlike poor Myron , who was forced to remove his with electrolysis ) . The blue jeans had begun to sag and now hung several inches below the waistline , revealing frayed Jockey shorts . Aware that the trousers were slipping , he tried to pull them up with one hand but I put a stop to that . " Hands flat against the wall ! " I ordered in a sharp voice that would not take no for an answer . " But , Miss Myra . . . " and his voice was suddenly no longer deep but a boy 's voice , plaintive and frightened : the young Lon McCallister . " Do as I say ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did as he was told . In the process , the blue jeans cleared the curve of his buttocks and now clung precariously to the upper thighs of which a good two inches were in plain view . It was a moment to cherish , to exult in , to give a life for . His embarrassment was palpable , charging the situation with true drama since from the very beginning it has been quite plain to me that in no way do I interest him sexually . Since he detests me , my ultimate victory is bound to be all the more glorious and significant . I studied my captive for some moments ( the spine did indeed make an S-like curve and the thick white trapezoidalligament was twisted to one side ) . Of greater interest to me , however , were the Jockey shorts and what they contained . But now I knew that I would have to proceed with some delicacy . I crossed to where he stood.  |p72I  was so close to him that I could smell the horselike odor men exude when they are either frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was fright . Delicately I ran my hand down his spine . He shudderedat my touch but said nothing . Meanwhile I spoke to him calmly , easily , the way one does in order to soothe a nervous animal . " Yes , I can see the trouble now . It 's right here , under the shoulder blade . " I kneaded the warm smooth skin , and again he winced but said nothing while I continued to give my " analysis " of his condition . " Perhaps a brace in this area would help . " Now my hands were at the narrow waist . He was breathing hoarsely , arms pressed so hard against the wall that the triceps stood out like white snakes intertwined , ready to strike. 1 felt something warm on the back of one hand : a drop of sweat from his left armpit . " But perhaps the trouble is lower down . Around the small of the back . Yes , of course ! The lumbar region  --  that 's just where it is ! " As I spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the worn elastic band of his shorts and before he was aware of what was happening , I had pulled them down to his knees . He gave a strangled cry , looked back over his shoulder at me , face scarlet , mouth open , but no words came . He started to pull away from me , then stopped , recalling that he was for all practical purposesnude . I-le clung now to the wall , the last protector of his modesty . Meanwhile I continued to chat . " Yes , we can start the brace right here . " I touched the end of the spine , a ratherp73protuberant bony tip set between the high curve of buttocksnow revealed to me in all their splendor . , . and splendor is the only word to describe them ! Smooth , white , hairless except just beneath the spinal tip where a number of dark coppery hairs began , only to disappear from view into the deep crack of buttocks so tightly clenched that not even a crowbar could have pried them apart . Casually I ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the touch they were like highly polished marblewarmed by the sun of some perfect Mediterranean day . I even allowed my forefinger the indiscretion of fingeringthe coppery wires not only at the tip of the spine but also the thicker growth at the back of his thighs . Like so many young males , he has a relatively hairless torso with heavily furred legs . Myron was the same . With age , however , the legs lose much of this adolescent growth while the torso 's pelt grows heavier . I had now gone almost as far as I could go with my inspection . After all , I have not yet established total mastery . But I have made a good beginning : half of the mysteryhas now been revealed , the rest must wait for a more propitious time . And so , after one last kneading of the buttocks ( I tried and failed to pull apart the cheeks ) , I said , " That will do for now , Rusty . I think we 've almost got to the root of the problem . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side and grabbed the fallen trousers . Had he slightly squatted  --  the normal thing to do in his position  --  I might have caught a glimpse of the heart of the mystery from thep74rear , an unflattering angle which , paradoxically , has alwaysexcited me , possibly because it is in some way involved with my passion for " backstage , " for observing what is magic from the unusual , privileged angle . But he kept his legs as much together as possible , pulling on clothes with astonishing speed , the only lapse occurring when something in front was caught by the ascending shorts , causing him to grunt and fumble . But then all was in order and when he finally turned around , the belt buckle had been firmly fastened . He was satisfyingly pale and alarmed-looking . I was all business . " I think this has been a very useful session  --  yes , you can put on your shirt . " His hands trembled as he buttoned his shirt . " I 'll have a chat with the chiropractor Uncle Buck uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Academy ) " and we 'll see what he can do for you . " " Yes , Miss Myra . " The voice was almost inaudible . Nervously , he mopped his face with a handkerchief . " It is stuffy in here , is n't it ? I always turn the airconditioningoff . It 's bad for my sinus . Well , I do n't want to keep you another minute from Mary-Ann . What a wonderfulgirl ! I hope you realize how lucky you are . " " Oh , yes , Miss Myra , I sure do , " he gabbled . Then , with the assurance that I had only his interest at heart , I showed him out of the room . It was , in many ways , the most exciting sensual moment of my life  --  so far . But the best is yet to come , for I mean to prove once and for all to Dr. Montag that it is possible to work out in life all one 's fantasies , and so become entirely whole . No sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his T-shirt behind . I buried my face in its warm sweaty folds , a most agreeable surrogate for skin . The odor was somewhat sharp at the armpits but by no means unpleasant since fresh sweat is the greatest of aphrodisiacsas well as nature 's own lubricant.  |p76BUCK  LONER REPORTS  --  Recording Disc No. 72I  --  i8 FebruaryDont know when I have ever come across a woman as awful as Myra Breckinridge she is wreaking total havoc with the program telling the students they have no talent and no chance of star dom which is downright mean not to mention bad for business so I had a talk with her in the back of the auditorium where she was holding her Empathy class which for reasons not clear to me is double the size of any of the other classes the kids are fas cinated by her because of what she says and she is a sharptongued bitch no doubt of that theres seldom a class of hers where somebody do nt run out crying to beat the band but they come back for more which is downright unhealthy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of our work here at the Academy which is to build up capital c confi dente exclamation point paragraph well she just gave me that high and mighty stare of hers and saidp77you think lying to people is good for them you think telling somebody whos got cancer that he is all right and does nt need an operation is the right thing to do of course not I said but if he has had the operation and is a terminal case I think you must keep him as happy as possible and in a good frame of mind under the circumstances well she said in a voice so loud that the students on the stage who were pretending to be billboards could hear her at least you admit that these cretins are terminal cases and that its curtains for the lot of them no it is not I said want ing to crack her one against the side of her head just to take that smirk off of her face no they are carefully selected as possible candidates for future stardom every last one of them well then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiss that I swear sent shivers down my spine like some mean old rattler out there in the sagebrush just wait ing to sink his fangs into your leg well I was not about to be put down in my own Academy and so I said getting real tough you do n't talk to me that way and get away with it you consider yourself warned or else Ill have you out of here so fast you wont know what hit you to which she just smiled prettily and cocked her pretty head at me and said ever so sweet you just try it you motherfucker and Ill take this whole place away from you lock stock and Em pathy class well I do nt think no woman has ever spoke to me like that certainly no man would dare for fear of getting hisself beat to a pulp all I could say then was well you watch your step thats all and as for taking this place away from me I need to know a whole lot more about you than I do why i do nt even know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well I suppose I did go too far on that one for she hauled off and let me have itp78right in the kisser and I saw stars because this wasnt no girls slap no sir it was a goddam fist with what felt like a roll of quarters in it I nearly fell over it was such a jolt and the noise mustve been like a pistol going off for the kids all stopped pretending to be billboards and stared at us like we was putting on a show which is the way she handled it for cool as can be she said to the kids I quote now that is the classic stage slap delivered in such a way that though the person being slapped really seems to be hit hard he isnt its all fake later Ill show you how its done its a trick first used on stage by Miss Patricia Collinge in The Little Foxes so thank you Uncle Buck for the demonstration unquote and with that the bitch went back to teaching her class and I come straight back here to the office and canceled my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then phoned to Flagler and Flagler to ask if theres any report on her from the detective in New York they say the only thing theyve so far found is that Myron really was a fag quite well known in what they call the underground movie set and its thought he killed hisself probably because of Myra about who they cant find out anything except there is no record of her marrying him in New York New Jersey or Con necticut they are meanwhile going to check the other forty-seven states it would be the happiest day of my life if I can find out she really was n't married to him and put her in the damned hoosegow for fraud on the other hand the three wills are all in order worse luck for me so everything depends now on that marriage license do nt forget Bobbie Deans yoghurt with prune whipp79I am sitting in a booth at Schwab 's drugstore in Hollywoodwhere the young Lana Turner was discovered by an agent . Of course the present Schwab 's does not in the least resemble the Schwab 's of thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one where I am sitting contains booths while the other is occupied by drugstore , soda fountain and a large display of magazines and paperback books where out-of-work actorsand actresses can be seen at any time of day or night furtively reading Silver Screen , or searching feverishly through the pages of novels looking for lurid passages whose crude imagery can be calculated to enliven sexual bouts with " loved ones " or , as one hippie said to another after sex , " I 'll tell you who I was thinking of if you 'll tell me who you were thinking of . " It is curious how often the male ( and sometimes the female ) needs to think of those not present in the act . Even with Myron , I was always imagining someone else ,  |p80a  boy glimpsed at Jones Beach or a man observed briefly at the wheel of a truck or sometimes ( yes , I may as well confess it ) a slender blonde girl that used to live in the brownstone next door when we lived at the corner of z ith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Students League and though I never once spoke to her , I was constantly aware of her and learned a good deal about her from the owner of the Ninth Avenue Delicatessenwhere each of us had an account , ours too seldom paid on time . Fortunately , I am no longer susceptible to the charm of the female body . Not that a straightforward invitation from the young Lana Turner or the young Ava Gardner might not , as they say out here , " turn me on , " but luckilyfor me there is no longer a young Lana Turner or Ava Gardner and so my lust has taken a different and quite spectacular form since Myron 's death . Rusty has been avoiding me ever since the day of his humiliation . He has even taken to cutting Posture class , which is a serious matter . This morning as I was on my way to Empathy II ( held in the auditorium because of the students ' desire to be taught by me : the other teachersarc mad with envy ! ) , I bumped into Rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I dropped my briefcase , which he swiftly retrieved . " I 'm sorry , Miss Myra . " He handed me the briefcase at arm 's length as though it contained a ticking bomb . " You really should watch where you 're going . " I was severe and he gulped like Gary Cooper , his attractiveness greatly enhanced by a total inability to look me in the eye.  | " You 've missed two Posture classes in a row . That 's very serious , Rusty . Very , very serious . You know how Uncle Buck dislikes that , and how it is bound to count against your final grade . " " But I been real busy , Miss Myra . Working , see ... " " The garage ? " " No , with these friends , helping to start this business . Anyway , next week I 'll be back in class and that 's for sure , Miss Myra . " He looked at me with such frightenedsincerity that it was all I could do to keep my hands off him right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had characterized him in our early relations . Now he was jittery and profoundly hostile , and all because of me ! Though the corridor was airconditionedto a polar temperature ( like so many fat men Buck suffers from heat ) , a bead of sweat appearing at the tip of one sideburn reminded me to say , " I still have the T-shirt you left in my office . " Bright red at this reference to his humiliation , he said that he was sorry to be so forgetful and that , if it was all right , he would come around sometime and retrieve the garment . Then the bell rang for class and we parted . I watched him a moment as he ran down the corridor , the buttocks that once I had beheld in all their innocent naked glory covered now by thick corduory . Soon I shall have occasion to examine them again , at leisure , as his education continues , impelling each of us inexorably toward the last degree . The class went well until Buck decided to look in . I tolerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I was forced to take a stern line with him . In fact ,  |p82after  he made a direct challenge to my authority , I struck him . All in all , it was a most satisfying thing to do and it will be some time before that keg of lard dares to cross me again . Afterwards , in the faculty room ( wall-to-wall champagne-beigecarpeting , piped-in music , and a color televisionset ) , two of my colleagues joined me for coffee from the mechanical dispenser . Apparently " everyone " has heard that there was some sort of contretemps between me and the president of the Academy . But I assuredthem that Uncle Buck and I could never quarrel about anything . " Oh , perhaps a disagreement or two about how far one should go in telling the students whether or not they really do have talent . " Unfortunately both my colleagues share the Buck Loner philosophy . One of them is a Negro queen named Irving Amadeus . A recent convert to the Bahai religion , he lives entirely on organic foods raised in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Van Nuys which he shares with a number of fellow cultists . There are , incidentally , nine Negro teachers but only seven Negro students . Though I suspect that Buck dislikes our dusky cousins , he has done his best to integrate the school at the teaching level , leaning over backwards to give work to almost any show-biz-type Negro who comes his way ( the Stepin Fetchit Lecture Series , however , fell through at the last moment , due to a contractual snag ) . But at the student level , integration has not been easy . A vocal minority are prejudiced , possibly because many young white males fear the Negro cock . Time and again I have observed white youths inadvertently clench theirp83buttocks at the approach of a black man , as though fearfulof anal penetration , not realizing that the legend of Negro size is just that  --  legend . The dozen or so jungle bunnies I have trafficked with were perfectly ordinary in that department . . . in fact , two were hung like chipmunks ( Myron , incidentally , was larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , caused him not joy but despair ) . The physiological origin of the myth was once explained to me by Dr. Montag . Apparently the Negro penis limp is almost the same size as it is when erect , a phenomenon which , though it causes consternationin a shower room , brings no added joy to the bedroom . Nevertheless , uneasy white males still continue to tighten their rosy sphincters at the approach of spooks . In defense of the Buck Loner philosophy , Irving Amadeus ( he pretends to have been Jewish before his conversion to Bahai ) spoke of love . " It is necessary to have love for all things , particularly those young people entrusted to our care . " " Love , " I said , " ought never to exclude truth . " " But love does not wound . " He continued for some time in this vein . Fortunately Miss Cluff , the other teacher , has no interest in love , at least of the caritas sort . She is lean and profoundly Lesbian , forever proposing that we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is teaching the Bell TelephoneHour Course in Song in order to make enough money to pay for a concert debut in New York . " Nonsense ! " she said to Bahai , cutting him short . " We must wound if we are to create artists . I myself am the result of an uncle whom I hated , a teacher of piano whop84'forced me at the age of nine to practice seven , eight , ten hours a day , striking my fingers with a stick whenever I got a note wrong . This was in Oregon . " We all recognized the plot of The Seventh Veil and so were able to ask the right questions in order to help her complete the fantasy whose denouement was that , in spite of everything , she had come through , become an artist , after the obligatory nervous breakdown , et cetera , and she owed it all to her uncle who had been cruel but cared . I found this conversation pleasing , for I am always happy when people resort to the storehouse of movie myth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not prepared , however , for her next observation . " There is really only one talented student in any of my classes and that is a girl called Mary-Ann Pringle . " I sat up , almost spilling the dregs of my coffee . Had I missed a trick ? " But I know the girl . I have her in Posture . She is a complete nothing . " " Except , " said Black Beauty , " for her connection with Rusty Godowsky . I have him in Atavistic Rhythm , and I am here to tell you that that ofay boy has really got sex appeal in spades ! " ( All in all , not a happy figure of speech , I thought . ) " I know what he 's got , " I said too quickly , and not quite accurately . " Then you know he is absolutely total man , or , as we in Bahai believe ... " " What , " I turned to Miss Cluff , drowning out Mother Africa , " is so talented about Mary-Ann Pringle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white bel canto . Untrained , of course , like a smudged diamond , but a jewelp85no less . She could be a star of the same magnitude as ... " Kathryn Grayson ? " Miss Cluff is too young to know from experience the Forties and too self-absorbed to attend films seriously . For her the movies are simply a pretext for getting girls onto the back seat of her secondhand Oldsmobile . " She could . . . she must sing opera . " But Darkness at Noon saw , perhaps rightly , another fate for Mary-Ann . " As long as that young man wants her she wo n't have a career . And from what I 've seen of him these last two years , he shows no sign of losing interest . Every girl in Atavistic Rhythm has made a play for Rusty , and no dice . " Miss Cluff looked grim . " Women 's rights are never won ! Never ! To think that a girl of her talent is prepared to waste her life  --  and genius  --  on a hulk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A mighty cute thing , " giggled Heart of Darkness , but then recalled himself to add , more seriously , " and talented , too , possessing a natural animal magnetism , and of course highly photogenic as we all of us saw last spring , before Myra joined us , when he acted in a Rod Serling classic on the closed-circuit TV . . . " Although I usually collect every comment testifying to Rusty 's male attractiveness , adding bit by bit to the vivid mosaic that is Rusty the Man ( soon to be shattered by me into a million fragments , that I may then rearrange him along other and more meaningful lines ) , I suddenly found myself morbidly eager to hear about Mary-Ann . Miss Cluff , eager to tell , told . And I believed her.  |p86Though  mad as a hatter , Miss Cluff is every bit as toughmindedabout the arts as I am . And so I am tempted to believe her when she tells me that Mary-Ann has star quality . The columnist Sidney Skolsky has just entered the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As well they might ! With Louella and Hedda gone , he is Mr. Movies . They say his office is upstairs.  |p87I  am home now . The blinds are raised and I have been staring for some minutes at the bespangled ten-times-lifesizegirl as she slowly turns in front of the Chateau Marmont . For me she is Hollywood , and mesmerizing . No further encounter with Rusty . He attended one Posture class but we did not speak and he was more than ever nervous and sullen in my presence . His T-shirt is still in my desk drawer , which now smells of him , a musky disturbing odor that makes me quite weak since , regretfully , I am not able to smell the original , for he keeps half a room 's distance between us . I must soon make operative the second phase of my plan . Meanwhile , to my surprise , Mary-Ann has been unusuallyfriendly . When I told her yesterday that Miss Cluff thought her very talented , she was enormously pleased . " Miss Cluff is nice to say that . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only room for one star in any bed . . . I mean family . " She stammered , blushingp88deliciously at her error , which was no doubt a lovers ' joke . " I 'm sure that 's what he would say . It 's the usual male view . " " But I like it . Honestly I do . I think the man 's got to be boss so a girl knows where she is . " " I 'm afraid that 's a slightly outmoded point of view . " I was careful , however , not to sound too sharp . " Particularlynow when the relationship between the sexes is changing so rapidly , and women are becoming aggressive and men passive and . . . " " Which I just hate ! " Mary-Ann was unexpectedly vehement . Good . The subject has occurred to her before . Excellent . " I hate these boys who just drift around , taking pot and trips and not caring if  --  well , if it 's a boy or a girl they 're with . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I guess that 's why I 'm so hung up on Rusty . He 's all man . " I thought with some amusement of " all man 's " defenselessbottom , quivering at my touch . I have the power forever to alter her image of Rusty . But that is for later . Now I must win her friendship , even love . The plan requires it . Although Dr. Montag and I write one another at least once a week , I feel somewhat guilty for not having told him what I am up to ( these notes will be your introduction , dear Randolph ) . On the other hand , we do discuss the one topic we most disagree on , the changing relationshipbetween the sexes . Being Jewish as well as neoFreudian , he is not able to divest himself entirely of thep89Law of Moses . For the Jew , the family is everything ; if it had not been , that religion which they so cherish ( but happily do not practice ) would have long since ended and with it their baleful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds literally demoralizing the normal human sexual drive toward promiscuity . Also , the Old Testament injunctionnot to look upon the father 's nakedness is the core to a puritanism which finds unbearable the thought that the male in himself might possess an intrinsic attractiveness , either aesthetically or sensually . In fact , they hate the male body and ritually tear the penis in order to remind the man so damaged that his sex is unlovely . It is , all in all , a religion even more dreadful than Christianity . Dr. Montag , however , is a thoughtful man , aware of the damage done him as a child growing up in the householdof a kosher butcher whose wife wanted their son to be a rabbi . But even then Randolph was a nonconformist ; he chose to be a dentist , that last resort of the rabbi manque . But dentistry soon palled ( it was the tongue , not the teeth that interested him ) and so he became a psychologist , and his book , Sexual Role and/or Responsibility , made a complete shambles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Montag some years ago at a lectureMyron gave on " The Uterine Vision in the Films of the Forties " ( this lecture is the basis for the chapter on Betty Hutton and Martha Raye in his Parker Tyler book ) . Needless to say , the lecture was sparsely attended . Myron was a nervous lecturer and his voice had a tendency to become shrill if he sensed any serious dis/agreement , and of course there was  --  is  --  always disagreementabout his work as there is bound to be controversyabout the work of any entirely original thinker . On that famous night poor Myron was forced to shriek his way through the lecture in an effort to drown out the usual hecklers ( this particular talk was given , like so many of his best performances , at the Blue Owl Grill on 132nd Street , a place where Happenings used to occurregularly before Happenings were known , and of course poets read ) . When the lecture was over and the booing had ceased , we were joined by a thickset man with blue jowls . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking Myron 's fragile hand into his own large one . " Dr. Montag , " the man added but without unction or pride , merely a simple statement , " and I want you to know that you have broken new ground along lines similarto my own . " They talked until morning . I had never before known Myron to be so excited , so energized , so exalted as he was at that moment when he found for the first time in his life a masculine mind complementary to his own . This is not the place to review their joint achievements ( as you know better than anyone , Randolph , and it is essentially for you and to you that I write in this notebook , a most liberating activity as well as an excellent way for me to tell you how much I admire you without any of the uneasinesscaused by our usual face-to-face encounters , particularlythose official ones when I am on the patient 's couch and you are striding noisily about the room , wheezing and gasping from emphysema ) . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three of usp91but for the world , since many of the insights in Sexual Role as well as at least four chapters of Myron 's Parker Tyler book can be said to have had their genesis in our knowing one another . But now I am troubled by something in the letter just arrived . Referring to Myron with his usual fondness ( do you deliberately want to set me off ? ) , Dr. Montag remarked : " Myron 's polymorphism ( quite exceptional even by contemporary standards ) was coupled with a desire to surrender entirely to the feminine side of his nature , symbolized by you . Yet I can not help but believe that his masculinity was of great intensity , as you knew best , while the sadomasochistic proportion was quite evenly balanced . That is to say , he was as apt to beat up trade as be beaten up . " This is not exactly correct . For all Dr. Montag 's extraordinary sensitivity , he remains at heart a dentist of the most conventional kind . Myron 's masculinity was , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the controlling ones , as I knew best . He wanted men to possess him rather than the other way around . He saw himself as a woman , made to suffer at the hands of some insensitive man . Needless to say , he found partners galore . When I think of the elaborate dinners he used to cook for merchant seamen with tattoos ! The continual fussing about the house , so reminiscentof the female preparing to lay her egg ! The humiliatingposition he would put himself in when some piece of trade spurned him because he was not able to lay on the requisite bread ! Yet , paradoxically , Myron was physicallyquite strong despite the seeming fragility of his body and , properly aroused , he could beat up a man twice hisp92size ; unfortunately , he took no more pleasure in this than he did in the company of lovely girls . He was a tormentedcreature , similar to Hart Crane , except that while it was Crane 's kick to blow those sailors he encountered along the squalid waterfronts of that vivid **27;8652;TOOLONG world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was a source of great consolation to Myron , Dr. Montag always felt , in his somewhat naive way , that Myron 's obsession involved a certain amount of gratuitous perversity , not to mention just plain waste because Myron 's own penis was exceptionallylarge and much admired ( it can be seen briefly in the underground film Lysol ) . Dr. Montag never understood that Myron 's sexual integrity required him to withhold that splendid penis from those who most needed it , thus exerting power over them and what , finally , are human relations but the desire in each of us to exercise absolute power over others ? It is my view that the struggle to achieve power is the underlying theme to all of Myron 's work , even though he never formulated it clearly . Certainly , I was never able to do so until his death clarified so many things for me . At the time I wanted to die , too . But then I entered the next stage : mystical elation . I understood  --  or thought I understood  --  everything ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desire to draw into himself , literally , that which men possess for quite anotherpurpose . For him to be able to take from Woman her rightful pleasure  --  not to mention the race 's instrument of generation  --  became a means of exercising power over both sexes and , yes , even over life itself !  |p93That  is why he was never drawn to homosexuals . In fact , once the man wished to penetrate him , Myron lost interestfor then he himself would become the thing used , and so lose the power struggle . What excited him most was to find a heterosexual man down on his luck , preferably starving to death , and force him to commit an act repugnantto him but necessary if he was to be paid the money he needed for survival . At such moments , Myron confessed , he knew ecstasy : the forbidden was his ! He had conquered Man , even though to the naive observer it was Myron who seemed to be the one used . But he was almost always user , and that was his glory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insatiable . The more one obtains , the more one wants . In the end Myron could not , living , be what he wanted to be , an all-powerful user of men , and so he ended his life , leaving me to complete as best I can not only his masterpiece but the pattern he sought to make , with Dr. Montag 's reluctant help . Yet it is now plain to me that the good Doctor preferredMyron to me , and I can not at times avoid a certain sense of hurt and rejection . Particularly when I realize that the only way the Doctor could be made happy would be if I were to marry and settle down . Dr. Montagstill believes that each sex is intended to be half of a unit , like those monsters mentioned in Plato 's Symposium . This is the Doctor 's Mosaic side overwhelming common sense , not to mention the evidence of his senses . Admittedly some are best served when the struggle for power narrows to but one other person and the duel enduresfor a lifetime as mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is called mar/riage . Most human beings , however , prefer the short duet , lasting anywhere from five minutes with a stranger to five months with a lover . Certainly the supreme momentsoccur only in those brief exchanges when each party , absorbed by private fantasy , believes he is achievingmastery over the other . The sailor who stands against a wall , looking down at the bobbing head of the gobbling queen , regards himself as master of the situation ; yet it is the queen ( does not that derisive epithet suggest primacyand dominion ? ) who has won the day , extracting from the flesh of the sailor his posterity , the one element in every man which is eternal and ( a scientific fact ) cellularlyresembles not at all the rest of the body . So to the queen goes the ultimate elixir of victory , that which was not meant for him but for the sailor 's wife or girl or simply Woman . Much of my interest in the capture of Rusty is the thought that he is so entirely involved with Mary-Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it were freely offered , I would reject it . Fortunately he hates me which excites me and so my triumph , when it comes , will be all the sweeter.  |p95BUCK  LONER REPORTS  --  Recording Disc No. 736  --  22 FebruarySo decision has been made to pre sent for the June jamboree a musical comedy based on the life story of Elvis Presley who will I am sure be present to see this show or better be since he isnt doing all that well box office wise and could use the publicity I do nt know who can play the lead but we got a lot of boys capable of singing like Elvis except funnily enough I was surprised to see some objec tions raised from some of the kids on the ground that Elvis is old fashioned and another generation like Bing Crosby well this made me feel old but I said you got to have some traditional values and respect the show business greats even when they are over thirty years old the girl who will sing the girl lead will be Mary Ann Pringle then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color TV dra mas from the old Playhouse go which again brings a lot of criticism down on my head from the hippiesp96who have no respect for the classics of early tele vision well they will learn better anyway we have a lot of speaking parts in both plays and the western lead will be Rusty Godowsky who is aimed for star dom if he stays out of the clink write the Governor another letter about the Ronald Reagan festival ex plaining it was no joke but a serious offer for him to M C the festival and gain good exposure period good news at last from the lawyers about one Myra Breckinridge who was never repeat never married to my nephew in any one of the fifty United States now Flagler and Flagler will fix her pretty wagon and out she goes on her ass the way she is making trouble around here is like some kind of God damned plague of Egypt telling everybody how lousy they are reminder to stop by Farmers Market and buy okra Bobbie is cooking gumbo tonightp97Clem Masters grows on one . At that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bathtub , I thought him the creep of the world . But since then I have got to know him and of all the students , he is the only one with something resembling a brain . He comes , needlessto say , from the East ( Buffalo , New York ) , and wants to be a singer but will probably settle for a career as songwriter . This morning , after Empathy , I met him in the corridor and he said , " Come on , baby , and let me play you something I just wrote . " " Wrote ? " I asked . " Or stole from the Beatles like that last little number you recorded for Pop Tune IV ... " " You 're a gas , Myra . " He was not in the least distressedby my accusation of plagiarism . In fact , of all the students he alone seems not to fear me and since he interests me not at all sexually ( he is weedy-looking with thick glasses and a black beard and never washes ) , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the music rooms where he promptly fell upon the piano and rushed through several loud syncopated numbers , bellowing banal lyrics at the top of his voice . When at last he stopped , I said the truth , as always , " It 's just awful , Clem . " " You crazy mixed-up chick ! " He laughed , he actually laughed at Myra Breckinridge ! My first instinct was to slam shut the piano cover on his spidery fingers , breaking them all at once . But then I realized that his physical agony would do nothing for me , and so I laughed , too ( a good sport like Carole Lombard ) , and said , " Why crazy ? Why mixed-up ? " " Because what you heard is music , popular music and I am going to sell the whole mother score , piece by piece , to the Four Skins . " " What score ? What skins ? " He looked at me pityingly . " The Four Skins are numberfour and number twenty-seven respectively in the January Billboard . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elvis Presley big Buck Loner has inflicted upon us  --  will make me some money . " " In that case , I think your songs are perfectly apt . " " I knew you had taste ! Now listen , Myra , in some sick way you appeal to me . No , I really mean it . I dig you and I was thinking why do n't we . . . " " Clem . " I was firm yet  --  how can I deny it ?  --  flattered . After all , I am a woman . " I enjoy your company , you know that . You 're the only student I can talk to but I could no more go to bed with you . . . " " Baby , baby , baby . . . " He interrupted me impatiently . " Not with me , baby . I do n't want to go to bed ,  |p99the  two of us . That 's square . I mean a party , like maybe twenty cats . . . " " Twenty men ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen , ever included a scene in which I was called upon to master twenty men at the same time . Might it not be too much , psychologically ? " Ten men and ten girls , you nit , or maybe seven of one and thirteen of the other or nine of one and eleven of the other . I mean who 's counting ? Want to make the scene ? " Clem looked at me shrewdly through thick spectacles . I was at a loss for words . On the one hand , the idea was definitely attractive . Myron sometimes enjoyed the company of four or five men at the same time but he did not believe in mixing the sexes . I of course do . Yet what pleasure , I calculated swiftly , would I extract from such a tableau ? My little quirks can only be fulfilled with one man at a time . I deliberately dithered , trying to make up my mind . " Oh , I do n't think I should . Certainly not with people I know , not with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never let those cats in on anythingif I can help it . No , you 'll meet all five of the Four Skins and some crazy chicks . . . oh , it 's your scene , I can tell . . . " I knew that my hesitation had already betrayed my interest . " Perhaps I might just . . . ' watch , you know , and perhaps help out , in little ways ... " " All or nothing . No tourists allowed . " He wrote an address on a slip of paper . " Tomorrow night . Ten o'clock . " He goosed me , which I detest , but before Ip100could knee him , the door was flung open and Miss Cluff looked in and blushed , for no discernible reason , and said , " Welcome to the Music Department , Myra . We 've all been looking for you . " " Clem was playing me his score . " " He 's so talented ! Mr. Loner wants to see you right away , it 's urgent . " Buck was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one eye . Since he made no move to sit up , much less stand up , when I entered the room , I was obliged to strike his feet a blow with my stout black leather handbag ; they slid off the desk and onto the floor with a crash . " Stand up when a lady comes into the room , you son of a bitch , " I said but with a sweet tone not unlike Irene Dunne in The White Cliffs of Dover . " Lady ! " He snorted . I leapt upon him , handbag raised to strike again , but he managed with unexpected agility to get to his feet and put the desk once more between us . " You 're nothing but some con-girl pretending to be married to my nephew when I got proof he never married nobody . Here ! " He thrust a legal document at me , which I ignored . I knew that I had been careless , and have been found out . My own fault . " No record of my marriage to Myron exists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for the excellent reason , " I wadded up the document and threw it at him , " that we were married in Mexico . " " Whereabouts ? " " My lawyers will tell your lawyers , " I said . " Meanwhile , if that settlement is not made by April first , I willp101take over the whole shooting match . " When in doubt , double the stakes , as James Cagney used to say . I departed regally , but I was  --  am  --  shaken by the interview . I immediately rang my lawyer to assure him that I will be able to produce the marriage license as soon as a new one is issued at Monterrey . Meanwhile  --  what a mess ! Suddenly I feel terribly alone and afraid . My mood was hardly improved " when I learned a few moments ago from a distraught Mary-Ann that Rusty has left town . When I pressed her as to why , she burst into tears and could not or would not say . I have never liked the month of February  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is warm.  |p102My  ground rules for the party were respected . I would wear bra and panties , unless otherwise inspired to remove them . Clem was forced to agree to this after I pointed out to him that in spite of his assurance to me no students would be present , Gloria Gordon was not only at the party but his hostess . My compromise was accepted . Give a little , get a little , as the saying goes . The party was held in a small house high in the HollywoodHills . I was driven there by a stocky monosyllabic man who was once a waiter at Romanoff 's and could , if he chose , tell a thousand stories about the stars he waited on but instead spoke to me only of the weather and baseball . But then I think that he was probably stoned when he came to pick me up , and not at his conversational best . When we arrived at the house , the door was opened by Clem , who wore nothing but glasses and a large door key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairy ,  |p103which  I do n't like , and though he did not have an erectionand so could not be fairly judged , his prick is small and rather dismal-looking as if too many people had chewed on it , and of course he is circumcised , which I find unattractive . Naturally , like so many physically underprivilegedmen , Clem regards himself as irresistible ( no doubt some obscure psychological law of compensationis at work ) . He promptly took me in goatish arms , rammed his soft acorn against my pudendum , and bit my ear . I stepped hard on his bare toes , and was promptly freed . " Jesus , Myra ! " He hopped on one foot , holding the other in his hand , a ludicrous sight that somewhat aroused me . I was even more aroused by Gloria who came to show me into the changing room . She , too , was nude with a body almost too beautiful for this world , slender and long , somewhat on the order of the early Jinx Falkenburg . As I undressed , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand one of those perfect rosenippledbreasts and simply hold it , worshipfully . AlthoughI am not a Lesbian , I do share the normal human response to whatever is attractive physically in either sex . I say normal human response , realizing that our culture has resolutely resisted the idea of bisexuality . We insist that there is only one right way of having sex : man and woman joined together to make baby ; all else is wrong . Worse , the neo-Freudian rabbis ( of whom Dr. Montag is still one despite my efforts at conversion ) believe that what they call heterosexuality is " healthy , " that homo/sexuality is unhealthy , and that bisexuality is a myth despitetheir master Freud 's stated conviction that all humanbeings are attracted to both sexes . Intellectually , Dr. Montag is aware of the variety of normal human sexual response but , emotionally , no dentistfrom the Grand Concourse can ever accept the idea that a woman could or should find quite as much pleasurewith her own sex as she does with men . Yet many women lead perfectly contented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minimum of nervous wear and tear . But in the great tradition of neo-Freudian analysis , Dr. Montag refuses to accept any evidence that does not entirely square with his preconceptions . For him it is either Moses or the Golden Calf . There is no middle range . Yet he is often persuasive , even luminous , and for a time Myron fell under his spell just as Dr. Montaghas since fallen under mine . Nevertheless , for all his limitations , it must never be forgotten that it was RandolphSpenser Montag who convinced Myron that one ought to live in consistent accordance with one 's essential nature . As a result , on the Staten Island ferry , Myron acted out a dream of the absolute and like a Venetian Doge married that symbol of woman the sea but with his life , not a ring , leaving me to change the world alone . Since that traumatic experience for us all , Randolph has been , in some ways , a new man , a changed dentist . Now he almost believes those stories his younger patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to whim and in response to the moment 's pleasure , stories he used to reject as wish-fulfillments . Be/tween a beautiful girl and an unattractive man ( between Gloria and Clem ) , I shall always be drawn , like any healthy-minded woman , to the girl , as I was last night when , very simply , I took both of Gloria 's breasts in my hands and stooped to kiss the appendix scar just to the right of her navel , for all the world like a delicate dimple , so marvelously had the surgeon done his work . " Chick , you are turning me on ! " Gloria exclaimed as she flung my dress willy-nilly upon the bed with all the other clothes . Then she clutched at my panties , but I restrainedher , reminding her of the agreement with Clem . She frowned and pouted . " Not even for me ? " she asked , fingering my lovely breasts already partially revealedthrough the lacy mesh of the bra . " Later , " I whispered , looking over Gloria 's shoulder at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he lacked in conversation he made up for in other ways . Beneath a not unpleasantly curved beer-belly , a large white object sprouted , as inviting to the touch as a well-wrought pitcher 's handle . On his way to the door , my hand snaked out and seized him , causing him to stop abruptly . I held him just long enough to achieve a small but exquisite sense of power ( he was not able to move , so powerful is my grasp ) . Then I released him . Shouting " Crazy ! " he vanishedinto the darkened room where the party was . Impressions : varied , some pleasant , some not . All in all , not my sort of scene . I need one man to break down , not twenty to serve . But visually the scene was appealing . Mattresses spread at random across a tile floor . Towelsp106hung from every lamp , giving a festive look to a room whose only light came from a single Moroccan lamp of intricately chased silver inset with red and blue glass . Aesthetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so were the girls ; the men had seen to that . In fact , simply on circumstantial evidence , one could tell that a man had selected the guest list , for though there were several attractive young studs in the room ( two of the five members of the Four Skins were present ) , the majority resembled Clem : physically unimpressive males forced to rely upon personality and money to get girls to bed . For my taste , they are exactly the wrong sort to have at an orgy , which , no doubt , is the reason why they are always the leading instigators of what is known locally as the " gangbang . " The party lasted four hours . That is as long as the male can hold out . Women of course can go on indefinitely if they are allowed occasional catnaps between orgasms . At one point Gloria experienced twelve orgasms in as many minutes ( supplied her by the ex-waiter from Romanoff 's , a really formidable man , capable of quite astonishing enduranceand restraint ) ; then she promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom she had been attending to in an absentminded way . To his great alarm , she could not be awakened . Fortunately , we were able to pry her mouth open and salvage . the tiny treasure before serious damage was done . Ten minutes later our Gloria was wide awake and ready for fun . This time Clem providedit . Having strapped on a formidable dildo because , as he said , " You got to have head , " he was able to givep107her maximum pleasure with a minimum of exertion on his part . My own participation was limited . I watched , and only occasionally helped out : a tickle here , a pull there , a lick , a bite , no more , except for one sudden rude intrusionfrom the rear which I did not see coming . It was one of the Four Skins , a hillbilly type who explained to me , as he was relieving himself , that he had first committed this particular act at the age of twelve with a sheep and so , to this day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goats , or did he say girls ? Like the rest of the Four Skins his conversation is as difficult to understand as the lyrics they sing . Had there been a pair of shears at hand , I would have made a steer of him on the spot but since there were not I did not , suffering in silence and even , to be honest , deriving a certain perverse , masochistic , Myronesqueenjoyment from the unlikely situation of Myra Breckinridge , victorious Amazon , laid low . Then , having discharged himself , the Skin abandoned me and proceeded on his bully way . I shall of course take my revenge upon him some day , somehow . . . even if I must wait twenty years ! Myra Breckinridge is implacableand pitiless . These graphic notes are really for your benefit , dear Randolph . Examples of the way that the goyim you essentiallydespise behave ( of course Clem is Jewish but he has been entirely absorbed by California , that great sponge into which all things are drawn and promptly homogenized , including Judaism ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help but be impressed at thep108ease with which these young people let themselves go , without any apparent fear of commitment or of compromise . The males do not worry about acting out what the society believes to be the man 's role ( brutal , destructive , vagina-centered ) ; they play with one another 's bodies in a sportive way , and seem to have no secret dreams they dare not act out . All is in the open , or as one of them said to me as he rested on the floor between engagements , " After a scene like this I do n't need it again for a week . I 've had it , and there 's nothing left I want , and I never feel so good like I do after a real party . " So the Dionysianis still a necessity in our lives . Certainly its absence has made the world neurotic and mad . I am positive that access to this sort of pleasure in my adolescence would have changed me entirely . Fortunately , as it turned out , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breckinridge could never have existed , and the subsequent loss to the world of Myra , the self-creation , is something we , none of us , can afford at this time . As I write these words , I suddenly think of Myron making love to Gloria Gordon ! Why ? How strange ... just the thought of such a thing makes my eyes fill suddenly with tears . Poor Myron . Yet , all in all , he is better dead . One must not underestimate the influence of these young people on our society . It is true that the swingers , as they are called , make up only a small minority of our society ; yet they hold a great attraction for the young and bored who are the majority and who keep their sanity ( those that do ) by having a double sense of themselves . On the one hand , they must appear to acceptp109without question our culture 's myth that the male must be dominant , aggressive , woman-oriented . On the other hand , they are perfectly aware that few men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not allow them to knock people down as proof of virility or in any way act out the traditional male role . As a result , the young men compensate by playing at being men , wearing cowboy clothes , boots , black leather , attemptingthrough clothes ( what an age for the fetishist ! ) to impersonate the kind of man our society claims to admirebut swiftly puts down should he attempt to be anything more than an illusionist , playing a part . It is the wisdom of the male swinger to know what he is : a man who is socially and economically weak , as much put upon by women as by society . Accepting his situation , he is able to assert himself through a polymorphic sexual abandon in which the lines between the sexes dissolve , to the delight of all . I suspect that this may be the only workable pattern for the future , and it is a most healthy one . . . certainly healthier than the rigid oldfashionedmasculinity of someone like Rusty whose instinctto dominate in traditional ways is bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with the old-fashioned Mary-Ann . . . relations which are currently at an end , for she has still not heard from him , or so she says . I suspect he has been busted , and just as I was about to make my final move . It is too unfair ! The party ended in an orgy of eating . Delicate girls devoured cold cuts as though they had not been fed in weeks , while spent youths lay snoring among tangled towels that smelled of new-made love . How Myronp110would have enjoyed all this ! Though I 'm afraid he would have paid more attention to the boys than to the girls and perhaps imitated my bull-like Skin who , waiting until one young man had assumed the classic position between a girl 's legs , leapt upon him and forced his way in , to the obvious irritation of the raped youth who , nevertheless , had sufficient aplomb ( and Dionysian abandon ) not to break his own stride , as it were  --  oh , how various are the ways of power !  |p111BUCK  LONER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far she has got the jump on me this morning she came into my office and gave me this Mexican wedding license apologizing for not having got it sooner but it was mislaid Uncle Buck I tell you when she calls me Uncle Buck like that Id like to break her neck she is living hell and theres no doubt about that she also said she was getting impatient for her share of the estate and she hoped quote mean old Flagler and Flagler would soon see their way clear to the half million dollar settlement unquote half million dollar settlement I asked it was three fifty that we finally agreed on before well she says quote that was before but I have been kept waiting and waiting while your detectives have been trying to get something on me like I was criticizing General Motors or something and so I regard the extra one fifty as damages for the mental anguish you have been causing me unquote well Ip112controlled myself as best I could and said quote now Myra you know what lawyers are and after all we never did meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and claiming to be mar Tied to my late nephew question mark end quote oh I see your point of view she says in quotes of course I do but you must also see mine and realize just what it is I have been going through since My ron died leaving me entirely alone in the world and broke well we kicked that around the poor defense less widow number and then she again gave me until April one to pay up or else she goes to court and really gets mean so I do my best to soothe her putting the blame on Flagler and Flagler but the thing is still fishy even though theres no doubt she was involved deeply with Myron because though I did nt know him I sure as hell knew Gertrude and at one point Myra let slip the fact that she personally had always found Gertrude hell particularly the way she used to save worthless things like newspapers and string and keep the icebox jammed with food that had gone bad that she was too damned miserly to throw out well Myra did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had a meal at Ger trucks was courting ptomaine but then when I said Gertrude really loved that boy of hers Myra frowned and said oh no she did nt Uncle Buck she just loved herself well do nt we 01 1 said no she said not to that degree unquote but she wouldnt open up any more obviously the two girls did not get on hard to say which is the worst no not hard at all Myra is the worst woman I have ever met exclamation mark paragraph she then asked me if I had had news of Rusty Godowsky and I said no but that our students often disappear for a time like that and then show up again like nothings happened but she said shep113was concerned because of poor Mary Ann being so heartbroken Mary Ann hell Im sure Myras got her eye on that stud like half the girls on campus and is now demonstrating the edginess of a filly in heat anyway I said I would look into the matter of his disappearance beginning by calling up my friend the Sheriff a good Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hoosegow since he was on probation to begin with period paragraph then Myra asks me for permission to look at the medical reports on the students which are kept in my outer office and are private because quote I am doing some research on the I think she said post Rosen berg generation she is probably a Commie along with everything else but I have to handle little Miss Dynamite with kid gloves so I gave her permission after all theres nothing interesting in any of them reports just a routine physical checkup at the be ginning of their academic life we did consider once taking naked pictures like they do at Yale but the girls objected or to be exact the mothers and fathers of the girls objected even though this is the era of the Playboy bunny so that very good idea came to naught period paragraph change masseuses ap pointment from this afternoon to tomorrow as I must go in to town for a conference with Letitia Van Allen the best actors agent in this town for young stars of tomorrow having in her pocket practically her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up sour cream for Bobbies beef Stroganoffp114I am sitting beside Mary-Ann at the CBS television studio on Fairfax Avenue . Though it is only a caricature of a film studio , the ultimate effect is impressive . So impressivein fact that I am more than ever certain that the movies are now a mere subsidiary to this electronic devicefor projecting images around the world at , literally , the speed of light . What it will mean , I have not yet worked out . But it is now plain that the classic age of films has ended and will not return any more than verse drama , despite the wonder of the Jacobeans , has a chance of revival . Of course visual narratives will always be filmed and shown if not in theatres on television . Yet the nature of those narratives is bound to change as television creates a new kind of person who will then create a new kind of art , a circle of creation that is only now just beginning . It is a thrilling moment to be alive ! And though I yearn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowp115that they can never be reproduced since their era is as gone as the Depression , World War II and the national innocence which made it possible for Pandro S. Berman and a host of others to decorate the screens of tens of thousands of movie theatres with perfect dreams . There was a wholeness then which is lacking now and neither Alain Resnais nor Andy Warhol ( the only film-makers of comparable stature today ) can give us work which is not hopelessly fragmented . I except always Warhol 's Sleeping Man , which broke new ground aesthetically and proved a radical theory I had always held but dared not openly formulate : that boredom in the arts can be , under the right circumstances , dull . I find it altogether too satisfying to be sitting beside Mary-Ann in the audience that has been assembled for the Art Linkletter Show . An M.C. is trying to warm us up with bad jokes . In a few minutes we shall be on the air , performers , technicians , audience , viewers  --  all made one by the magic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preferring as I do the total electroniceffect of , let us say , Milton Berle . But I am here because Mary-Ann wanted me to come and I usually do what she wants me to do for we are now curiously united by Rusty 's disappearance . Of course she continues to believe that I dislike him and think him an ape , and I do nothing to disabuse her of this notion . I find almost unbearablethe painful sweetness of knowing that I shall one day possess , in my own way , what she believes to be entirely hers , assuming of course that Rusty ever returns . Mary-Ann believes that if he is not in prison ( the likeliestpossibility since a boy with a police record is pronep116to constant false arrest in the Los Angeles area where only professional criminals are safe from harassment by the local police ) , he has gone off with some of his wild friends , possibly to Mexico . I do my best to soothe her , and we have long " girl-talks " about men and life .. . and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be professional . Miss Cluff is absolutely right and I for one would like to cut a corner or two and present her directly to an agent , instead of waiting until June , the usual time for the students to show what they can do which , traditionally , is not much . Miss Cluff tells me that in the seven years that she has been at the Academy no student has ever got a job on television or appeared in a film . This is a remarkable record . Some do get jobs modeling but that is often just plain whoring . When I asked Buck about the dismal showing his studentsmake in the professional world , he seemed not at all taken aback . " Honey , " he said , knowing how much I hate to be called " honey , " resembling , in this , the former First Lady , " what matters is making people happy and while the kids are here they are happy . Now there is , I am willing to admit , a real letdown come June when our kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big cruel place with maybe no place for them . Yes , I admit that 's an awful thing for them to find out and I 've even toyed with the idea of never allowing any agents or professionalpeople to come to the June exercises but of course if I really kept them away I 'd go out of business , so we all have to suffer through the June Letdown whichp117is immediately followed by the Buck Loner July Spectacularwhich is a series of awards based closely on the actual Academy Awards , with many Oscars ( or Bucks as the kids call them ) to be given out by some real-life celebrityon the order of Bobby Darin and that , let me tell you , sure as hell makes up for June . " " Yes , but sooner or later they will have to go out into the world . . . " " Why ? " The question was straightforward . " As long as they scrounge up enough money to pay the tuition they can stay here for life . Look at Irving Amadeus . He came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing star on the order of Paul Robeson and he is with us still , on the staff now as an invaluable teacher with over three hundred recordings to his credit . If that is n't as good as being a real star I do n't know what is ! " This curiously hateful philosophy has made Buck Loner rich . But then , to be honest , all that I care about at the moment is my share of his wealth . That and MaryAnn'scareer which she does not take seriously . " Only one star in the family , " she keeps quoting Rusty . To which I invariably reply , " You 're the star . He 's the garagemechanic . " I have now got Mary-Ann to the point where she will at least audition for an agent before June , and that means 1 must start making the rounds myself , trying to find the best person to handle her . Although her voice has a classictone like Jeanette MacDonald ( and so of no use in the current market ) , she also has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Verne , the most talented ofp118the Andrews Sisters . I am certain that if she were to developher La Verne-voice she could , with her remarkable appearance acting as opening wedge , become a star . Last night I played several Andrews Sisters records for her and though she had never before heard of the AndrewsSisters ( ! ) , she conceded that their tone was unusual  --  which is understating the matter ! Their tone is unique and genuinely mythic , a part of the folklore of the best years of the American past . They really did roll out that barrel , and no one has yet rolled it back . Mary-Ann has just nudged my arm . " Really , Miss Myra , you mus n't write like that in public ! " She chides me gently , for to write in public in the electronic age is to commit an antisocial obscenity . To please her , I shall now put away this notebook and listen to the jokes of the comedian as he responds to the sterile laughter of the studio audience of which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us  --  such a pleasure  --  on the air !  |p119Just  as I expected , seventy-two per cent of the male students are circumcised . At Clem 's party I had been reminded of the promiscuous way in which American doctorscircumcise males in childhood , a practice I highly disapprove of , agreeing with that publisher who is foreveradvertising in the New York Times Book Review a work which proves that circumcision is necessary for only a very few men . For the rest , it constitutes , in the advertiser 's phrase , " a rape of the penis . " Until the Forties , only the upper or educated classes were circumcised in America . The real people were spared this humiliation . But during the affluent postwar years the operation becamestandard procedure , making money for doctors as well as allowing the American mother to mutilate her son in order that he might never forget her early power over him . Today only the poor Boston Irish , the Midwestern Poles and the Appalachian Southerners can be counted upon to be complete.  |p120Myron  never forgave Gertrude for her circumcision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my presence for it . She defended herself by saying that the doctor had recommended it on hygienic grounds  --  which of course does not hold water since most foreskins are easily manipulatedand kept clean . What is truly sinister is the fact that with the foreskin 's removal , up to fifty per cent of sensation in the glans penis is reduced . . . a condition no doubt as pleasing to the puritan American mother as it is to her co-conspirator , the puritan Jewish doctor who delights in being able to mutilate the goyim in the same vivid way that his religion ( and mother ! ) mutilated him . I once had the subject out with Dr. Montag , who granted me every single point and yet , finally , turned dentist and confessed , " Whenever I hear the word smegma , ' I become physically ill . " I am sure Moses is roasting in hell , along with Jesus , Saint Paul , and GertrudePercey Breckinridge . I was not able to find Rusty 's medical report and so do not know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I prefer the penis intact . . . in order that it be raped not by impersonal surgery but by me !  |p121In  an alcove at the back of the cafeteria Buck Loner often has lunch with some notable he would like the studentsto observe at close hand . Today it was the famous agent Letitia Van Allen , and so I joined them , to Buck 's ill-disguised fury . Miss Van Allen is a handsome vigorouswoman of perhaps forty , with steely gray eyes . We got on famously , to Buck 's chagrin . " Talent is not what Uncle Buck and I deal in , Miss Van Allen , " I said , lightly resting my hand on Buck 's clenched fist . " We deal in myths . At any given moment the world requires one full-bodied blonde Aphrodite ( Jean Harlow ) , one dark siren of flawless beauty ( Hedy Lamarr ) , one powerful inarticulate brute of a man ( John Wayne ) , one smooth debonair charmer ( Melvyn Douglas ) , one world-weary corrupt lover past his prime ( Humphrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one wide-eyed chicken boy ( Lon McCallister ) , one gentle girl singer ( Susanna Foster ) , one win/ping stud ( Clark Gable ) , one losing stud outside the law ( James Cagney ) , and so on . Olympus supports many gods and goddesses and they are truly eternal , since whenever one fades or falls another promptly takes his place , for the race requires that the pantheon be always filled . So what we are looking for  --  and what you , Miss Van Allen , have found time and again  --  are those mythic figures who , at the right moment , can be placed upon their proper pedestal . For instance , since the death of Marilyn Monroe , no blonde voluptuous goddess has yet appeared to take her place and so , if I were creating stars , I would look for a girl who most filled that particularbill , who could be the lost Golden Girl . In fact , as in any other business , we must begin with market research . This means carefully analyzing Olympus to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contenders . At the moment the suave male seduceris in great supply while the befuddled normal man next door , filled with ludicrous fantasies , is a drug on the market , what with at least one and a half Jack Lemmon pictures each year . But the blonde goddess , the dark goddess , the singing girl and the inarticulate hero are each currently in need of someone to make of the divine spirit living flesh as well as eternal celluloid . At this very moment , perhaps in this very room , there are unknown boys and girls destined to be  --  for the length of a career  --  like gods , if only we can find and reveal them . That is why you and I , Letitia  --  I may call you that ?  --  are similarto those Tibetan priests who upon the death of the Dalai Lama must seek out his reincarnation . And so , like priestesses , despite all personal hardship , we must con/stantly test and analyze the young men and women of America in order to find the glittering few who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our race reborn . " There was a long silence when I finished . Buck toyed with his icebox cake while Letitia Van Allen simply stared at me . Then she said , " That is the damnedest , truestthing I 've ever heard said about this lousy racket . Come on , let 's have a drink . Buck , give us a drink in that office of yours , you old bastard ! " She took me by the arm . " He 's far and away the biggest con-man in the business , but from where I sit it looks like he may have met his match . You 've got quite a line and , as a fellow congirl , I would like to give it some study . " I had made , as I intended , an enormous impression . Over a beaker of Scotch in Buck 's office , Letitia told me in no uncertain terms that if I ever wanted to leave Buck there was a place in her office for a go-getter like me . Buck brightened when he heard this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't it ? This is too little a pond for a talent like yours . " To which I replied demurely , " It may be a small pond but it 's ours , Uncle Buck , yours and mine ( you see , Letitia , I 'm a half-owner of the property ) , and I could never let Uncle Buck down . " Buck 's face shut with a snap . Miss Van Allen missed this exchange , for I had just given her some photographs of Mary-Ann Pringle . " Pretty girl . But no Marilyn Monroe . " She gave the picturesback . " It 's her voice , " I explained . " That 's what makes her ap124possible immortal . She is the Singing Girl Goddess , waiting for the chance to reveal herself . " " They 're not making that kind of picture right now . But maybe she could work up a nightclub act or get in the road show of some Broadway musical . Anyway , on your say-so , I 'll listen to her  --  but not now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a monosexual . Only men arouse her . " We got some swell kids . . . " began Buck but I cut him short . " There 's one  --  maybe . Category : InarticulateHero . His name is Rusty Godowsky . . . " " That name has got to go and so do I. " Letitia turned to me . " Come see me the first of the week , Myra .. . lunch . . . I 'll pick your brains . You Easterners have all the kinky angles that are in right now . That 's what I keep telling them at Universal : Do n't be so California , for God 's sake ! California 's square , while the world is full of kinks as yet undreamed of in the Greater Los AngelesArea . ' Then she was gone . I could not help but rub it in . " Stick with me , " I said to the crestfallen Buck , " and maybe some of your studentswill work in show biz .

And loved it ! Yesterday I met Letitia at her offices on Melrose Avenue which occupy an entire Greek revival house , reminiscent of Tara , the late David O. Selznick 's trademark . All the rooms are furnished in such a way as to suggest a gracious Southern mansion , not a talent agency . Letitia 's private office ( we are now on a firstnamebasis ) is a lovely large airy second-floor bedroomcum-boudoir , a most unusual setting for a famous agent yet somehow entirely suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk in an alcove within view of the four-poster bed at the far end of the room . The effect is enchanting . The salad and cottage cheese lunch was less charming ( I have developed an extraordinary appetite lately and must for the first time in my life worry about becoming heavy ) . We talked of everything , and found many areas of agreement . She believes I would make a formidablep132agent and I have no doubt that she is right but I prefer to go my own solitary way as critic and mythmaker , and of course as explicator of the mind of Parker Tyler . Like Myron , I am in the tradition of Mortimer Brewster , the drama critic in Arsenic and Old Lace , a man for whom , as Tyler puts it so superbly , " the facts of lunacy , virginity , and death , the last a mask for impotence , are insepa-rable . " Over a dry martini after lunch ( Letitia , I suspect , has a drinking problem ) , we listened to a record of Mary-Ann singing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arranged by Miss Cluff . Letitia listened with eyes narrowed . When the record was finished , she again asked for photographs . I gave them to her . She studied them for a long time . " O.K. , " she said , " I 'll meet her . Make an appointment with my secretary , any free time next week . " Then Letitia put her feet up on a Regency bench . " Why 're you pushing this kid ? " " She has talent . So few people do . " " But according to your theory , that will probably count against her . Now if you do n't mind my asking a personal question , you are n't perhaps involved with her on a more personal level ? " I blushed for the first time in some years . " If you meanam I a dike , no . Not at all . Quite the contrary . ActuallyI 'm interested in her because of her boyfriend who happens to have skipped town and I feel sorry for her . . . . " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Letitia blew smoke rings thoughtfully . For an instant I wondered if perhaps I had not got her range . Butshe quickly assured me that my first impression of herp133had been the right one . " That bed , " she said , indicating the four-poster with a swagger stick , " has held just about every stud in town who wants to be an actor . Do I shock you , Myra ? " " How can you shock me when you are just like me ? The new American woman who uses men the way they once used women . " " Jesus , Myra , but you are quick ! What a team we 'd make . Sure you do n't want another martini ? It 's just water now in the shaker . ' Well , then I 'll have it . " She poured herself a full glass . " Listen , dear , if you find anythingreally interesting at that circus of no-talent Buck 's conducting , send him over for a chat with Letitia . " " With pleasure . " " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile which I answered with one equally brilliant . Two masterful women had met and there is no man alive capable of surviving our united onslaught . Like had been attracted to like from the first moment we met and though it was now plain that she expected me to supply her with studs , I was not in the least distressed at being so used . Women like ourselves owe it to one another to present a united front to the enemy . Meanwhile , as quid for my pro , she will try to find work for Mary-Ann . All in all , as satisfying an encounter as I have had since Dr. Montag first introduced himself to us at the Blue Owl Grill.  |p134Is  it possible to describe anything accurately ? That is the problem set us by the French New Novelists . The answer is , like so many answers to important questions , neither yes nor no . The treachery of words is notorious . I write that I " care for " Mary-Ann . But what does that mean ? Nothing at all because I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all ways . To be precise ( the task set us in the age of science ) , as I sit here at the card table in my room , wearing an old dressing gown of Myron 's , I can say that I like her eyes and voice but not her mouth ( too small ) or hands ( too blunt ) . I could fill many pages of yes-no and still not bring the reader to any deep knowledge of what it is I feel at 7:10 P.M. , March 12 . It is impossible to sort out all one 's feelings at any given moment on any given subject , and so perhaps it is wise never to take on any subject other than one 's own proteanbut still manageable self.  |p135What  does Mary-Ann think of me ? I could not begin to do more than guess nor , I suppose , could she answer this question even to herself : liking , hostility , attraction , revulsion , self-aggrandizement , self-sacrifice , all mingled together with no clear motif save the desire of each to exert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant , to which all else is tributary . Dr. Montag still challenges my theory from time to time . Once he spoke of the maternal instinct as something not involving power . But of course it does , in the most obvious way : the teat ( or bottle ) is the source of life to the baby , to be given or withheld at the mother'spleasure . If there is any more fulfilling way of achieving total power over another human being , I have yet to hear of it . Of course most people successfully disguise their power drives , particularly from themselves . Yet the will to prevail is constant and unrelenting . Take that charming , seemingly unaggressive man who makes apparently idle jokes that cause others to laugh . In a sly way , he is exerting power quite as much as Hitler did : after all , his listeners were not laughing until he made them laugh . Thus it goes , at every level . My own uniqueness is simply the result of self-knowledge . I know what I want and I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now preparing for a breakthrough into an area where , until Myron 's death , I could enter only in dreams . Having already destroyedsubjectively the masculine principle , I must now shatter it objectively in the person of Rusty , who has reappeared . But who am I ? What do I feel ? Do I exist at all ? Thatp136is the unanswerable question . At the moment I feel like the amnesiac in Spellbound , aware that something strange is about to happen . I am apprehensive ; obscurely excitedp137The telephone just rang . It was Mary-Ann . I have never heard her so excited . " He 's back ! Rusty 's back ! " I allowed her to think that she was telling me something that I did not know . In actual fact , late this afternoon , Irving Amadeus told me , " That beautiful creature just showed up for Atavistic Rhythm , and here we 'd all given him up for lost ! " I went straight to Buck 's office and checked with the secretary , who was at first reluctant to give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with Buck himself , she told me that Rusty had been arrested with two other young men at the Mexican border and held on suspicion of smuggling marijuana into the States . Fortunately , there was no very compelling evidence against them , and they were let go . Nevertheless , Rusty 's period of probation has been extended , and the probation officer has asked Buck to keep an eye on him . But Rusty had told Mary-Ann none of this . " You see ,  |p138he  was with these wild boys in Mexico and their car broke down and they were too broke to pay even for a bus ticket and so the American consul finally bailed them out , after they were practically starving to death . " No doubt about it , Rusty is very much a man of his era : his fantasy life shields Mary-Ann as well as himself from the cruel disorders of reality . Though I can not say that the pleasure of others has ever had any effect upon me except to produce a profoundmelancholy , I was almost pleased at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I whispered like Phyllis Thaxter in Thirty Seconds over Tokyo , with wonderful Van Johnson . " And we want to have dinner with you tonight , if that 's all right . I told him how simply wonderful you 've been to me while he was gone . " " I 'm sure you 'd rather have him all to yourself tonight . Besides , are you sure he wants to see me ? " There was a light hesitation , followed by much protestationto the effect that Rusty was really very admiringof me since I had been such a help to him in Posture class.  |p139It  is now midnight . In many ways , a most exciting evening . I met Mary-Ann and Rusty at the Cock and Bull on the Strip ; as one might guess , it is Rusty 's favorite restaurant for the food is profoundly hearty . He was unusuallyexuberant and for once I did not seem to make him uneasy . He improvised freely about his adventures in Mexico , all the while eating scones smeared with raspberryjam . I toyed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of becoming fat like Gertrude , who resembled , in her last days , a spoiled pear . " Then after we left Tijuana , we had to break up because , you see , three guys ca n't hitchhike together . Nobodywould pick up three guys looking like us , with beards and all dirty , though there was this one fruit . . . " Rusty frowned at the pseudo-memory or , more likely , at an actual recollection transposed to flesh out the current fantasy . " He was willing to give us ap140lift , this funny little Mexican with shiny gold teeth and so nervous those gold teeth was chattering but he wanted us real bad , but we said hell no , I mean who wants to go that route ? " " Many do , " I said casually , in such a way that I did not seem to be challenging him . Under the table I gave Mary-Ann 's hand a little squeeze which she gratefully returned . Rusty nodded wisely , mouth full . " Yeah , I know . Why there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school  --  who 'll sell their ass to some fruit for twenty bucks , just because they 're too lazy to get a job . " " But would n't you do that , if you needed the money ? " " Hell , I 'd starve first , and that 's the truth . " He pulled Mary-Ann close to him and gave her a kiss . I believed him . In a sense , Rusty is a throwback to the stars of the Forties , who themselves were simply shadows cast in the bright morning of the nation . Yet in the age of the televisioncommercial he is sadly superfluous , an anachronism , acting out a masculine charade that has lost all meaning . That is why , to save him ( and the world from his sort ) , I must change entirely his sense of himself . ' When Rusty had finally completed his story of having been down-and-out in Mexico ( borrowing heavily from a recent television drama on the same theme ) , we spoke of Mary-Ann and the good impression that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impressed . " Do you really think she likes Mary-Ann ? " " Very much . "  | " Oh , not that much . " Although a Kathryn Grayson singing star , Mary-Ann also belongs to the Joan Leslie tradition of self-effacing good-sex woman-wife . For her it is Rusty 's career that matters , not her own . " Anyway , " she said , " it 's all due to Miss Myra . She arranged the whole thing . " " That was a swell thing to do . " Rusty 's voice was deep and warm and he gave me a level gaze reminiscent of James Craig in the fourth reel of Marriage Is a Private Affair . " A mighty swell thing , and we 're both as grateful as we can be , " he added , carefully putting the two of them together on one side , leaving me alone on the other . " Who Miss Van Allen should really see is Rusty , " said Mary-Ann , predictably , to which I replied , as predictably , " Of course she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry , I 've already told her about him . " " That 's real nice of you . . . . " He was overcome by sincerity like James Stewart in any movie . Then the large veined hands with the blunt fingers took yet another scone and covered it with jam , and I meditated on the dark journey of those veins inside the jacket as they proceededup the marbled forearms , coiling about the thick biceps , vanishing finally in the deep armpits . What would Myron have thought of him ? Probably not much . Myron preferred the sinister and vicious , the totally abandoned . Rusty is not only not abandoned , he would not have been available , even to Myron whose technique as a seducer was highly developed . Yet where Myron would have failed I shall succeed . The fact that Rusty has not an inkling of my plans makes every moment we spend together in Mary-Ann'sp142company exquisite . Also , the deliberate ( on my part ) manipulation of the conversation was curiously thrilling , affording me an opportunity to observe how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neverfulfilleddesire of the dedicated anthropologist who realizesthat the moment he arrives in a village to study its culture , that culture has already been subtly altered by the simple fact of his presence ; just as the earthly microbesour astronauts are certain to let loose upon other worlds are sure to kill or change those extraterrestrial forms of life we would most like to preserve in order to understand . But then it is our peculiar fate to destroy or change all things we touch since ( and let us never forget it ) we are the constant and compulsive killers of life , the mad dogs of creation , and our triumphant viral progress can only end in a burst of cleansing solar fire , either simulatedby us or thrust upon us by the self-protective mechanism of a creation that can not for long endure too many violent antibodies within its harmonious system . Death and destruction , hate and rage , these are the most characteristic of human attributes , as Myra Breckinridge knows and personifies but soon means , in the most extraordinaryway , entirely to transcend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wooden table in the Cock and Bull did , eventually , alter significantly the behavior of the two natives as they lost their self-consciousness to the degree that the conversationceased to be particular and became general , somethingthat almost never happens among the lower orders who are , to a man , walking autobiographers , reciting their dull memoirs at extraordinary length , oblivious top143the extent they bore even others of their kind who , of course , wait impatiently to tell their stories . Somehow the subject reverted to Rusty 's proud rejectionof the Mexican 's advances , and Mary-Ann made it plain that for her part she could never consider making love to another woman . " It just . . . well , disgusts me , " she said . " I mean I just could n't . I think , well , a woman should act like a woman and a man should act like a man , and that 's that . " " But how should a man act ? " I was mild . Rusty knew . " He should ball chicks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only if he really loves them . " Mary-Ann was droll ; both laughed at what was obviously a private joke . " And why should he ball chicks ? " I continued my gentle catechism . " Well , because that 's . . . well , Christ , it 's natural ! " " And that 's how you get babies , " said Mary-Ann sagely . " I mean that 's how nature intended it . " " Do you think nature intended you to have a baby each time you make love ? " Mary-Ann looked like a lapsed Catholic , trying to recallwhat she had been taught . But Rusty was a good Catholic Pole and knew right from wrong . " That 's what you 're supposed to do , yes . That 's what we 're told in church . " " But you do use contraceptives , do n't you ? " Both flushed , and Rusty said , " Well , sure . I guess most Catholics do now , but that does n't mean you do n't know it 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right for morep144and more babies to be born , even though half the people ever born in the world are now alive , and that each day twelve thousand people starve to death in India and South America ? " Oh , the sly Myra Breckinridge ! Nothingcan escape the fine net of her dialectic ! Rusty frowned to show that he was thinking when actually , as one of the acting-students recently said of another'sperformance , he was only thinking he was thinking . " Well , maybe those Indians and Chinese and so on should probably practice birth control since their religiondoes n't care , if they have one ... " " But they do have religions . And they do care . And they believe that for a man to be manly he must have as many children as possible . . . " " Because so many babies die in childbirth . " Mary-Ann was unusually thoughtful . " They used to die , " I said . " And that kept the populationin a proper balance with the food supply . But now the children live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to be manly is to make babiesand to be womanly is to bear them . " " But we 're different . " Rusty was dogged . " We got enough food and we also have ... " " Family planning . " Mary-Ann looked happy . No doubt contemplating some planning of her own . " Enough food , " however , was all the cue I needed . I was brilliant . I quoted the best of the world 's food authorities ( famine for us all by 1974 and forget about plankton and seaweed : not enough of it ) . I demonstrated that essentially Malthus had been right , despite errors of calculation . I described what happens to rats when theyp145are crowded in too small a place : their kidneys deteriorate , and they go mad . I told how whenever the food supply of the lemmings is endangered , a majority of the race drown themselves in order that those left behind may flourish . Then I gave statistics for the current world death rate , showing how it has drastically declined in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mentally weak who ordinarily would have died at birth now grow up to become revolutionaries in Africa , Asia and Harlem . As a result of miracle drugs and incontinent breeding , the world 's food supply can no longer support the billions of people alive at present ; there will of course be even less food for those thousands who are joining us every minute . What is to be done ? How is the race to be saved ( I did not go into the more profound question of whether or not it should be saved ) ? My answer was simpleenough : famine and war are now man 's only hope . To survive , human population must be drastically reduced . Happily , our leaders are working instinctively towardthat end , and there is no doubt in my mind that nature intends Lyndon Johnson and Mao Tse-tung to be the agents of our salvation . By destroying a majority of the human race , they will preserve the breed since the survivors are bound to be not only wiser than we but racially stronger as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say so myself , I had my listeners ' eyes bugging out by the time I had sketched for them man 's marvelous if fiery fate . " But what can we do to stop all this from happening ? " Mary-Ann was plainly alarmed.  | " Do n't have children . That is the best thing . A gesture of course , but better than nothing . And try to change your attitudes about what is normal . " Then , in quick succession , I delivered a number of anthropological haymakers . Proper womanly behavior for an Eskimo wife is to go to bed with anyone her husband brings back to the igloo . Proper manly behavior for the Spartan warrior was to make love to a boy while teaching him how to be a soldier . I gave a rapid review of what is considered proper sexual behavior in Polynesia and along the Amazon . Everything I said came as revelation to Rusty and Mary-Ann , and they were obviously horrified by the unnaturalnessof what was considered natural in other parts of the world . I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never prostitute herself like an Eskimowife nor could Rusty ever make love to an adolescentboy ( " those teeny-boppers give me a pain " ) ; yet each now regards his old certainties as being , at least , relative . That is progress . As could be expected , it was Mary-Ann who mounted the counterattack . " Maybe you 're right when you say there 's nothing that 's really basically normal but when everybody tells you that they want you to behave in a certain way , like marrying one man and having only his children , is n't that the right thing to do because does n't the society deep down know what it 's doing , and is trying to protect itself ? " Unexpectedly she had made a good point . Not once in all these weeks have I suspected her of possessing a true intelligence . Obviously I have been misled by her Californiamanner which is resolutely cretinous as well asp147nasal . The possibility that she might one day be a woman I could actually talk to was a revelation , and by no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to win her point . Even so , it will , as we academics say , count against the final grade . I challenged her with a simple question : does any societyknow how to preserve itself ? I then listed a number of civilizations that had destroyed themselves through upholding customs that were self-destructive . For instance , the health of the Roman state depended upon a vigorous aristocracy but that aristocracy committed suicideby insisting that their cooking be done in expensive pots made of lead . The result was acute lead poisoning which led to impotence and the literal extinction of an entire class , killed by custom . Then , superb dialectician that I am , I discussed every society 's secret drive to destroyitself and whether or not this was a good thing , taken in the larger context of the human race 's evolution . They were both shocked at the idea , particularly when I brought it home to them by suggesting that Rusty 's desireto have sex only with girls and Mary-Ann 's desire to have at least four children the world did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now preparing to kill itself by exhausting the food supply and making nuclearwar inevitable . Should this be the case , the only alternative ( and a most unlikely one ) would be for all the Rustys to follow the Spartan custom of making love to boys while the Mary-Anns , as lovers of women , would at least help preserve the race by bringing no more children into the world . But of course I was playing devil 's advocatesince I am secretly convinced that we shall soon bep148purged by a chiliastic fire , and so , in the long run , currentbehavior will best serve us by hastening our necessaryend . Yet efforts must still be made to preserve life , to change the sexes , to re-create Man . There is an off chance that my mission may yet succeed . Mary-Ann was most depressed . I took her hand in mine . " Do n't worry , " I said . " What will happen will happen . Meanwhile , all I ask is that you be happy . . . and you , too , Rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann Sothern in the first of the Maisie films . " But to be truly happy , I think you must both begin to think a little bit about changing your sexual attitudes , becoming more open , less limited , abandoningold-fashioned stereotypes of what is manly and what is feminine . As it is , if you , Rusty , should ever find a boy sexually interesting , you might or might not do something about it but whatever you did do or did not do you 'd certainly feel guilty because you 've been taught that to be a man is to be physically strong , selfreliant , and a lover of girls , one at a time . " " So what 's wrong with that ? " Rusty gave me a cocky grin . " Nothing . " I was patient . " Except modern man is not self-reliant and as for making love to girls , that is only one aspect of his nature ... " " It 's my only one . Why , just the thought of boffing some hairy boy makes me sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairy as you , " I said gaily , recklessly . Mary-Ann looked surprised while Rusty looked uneasy at this reminder of our old intimate encounter . Ip149turned to Mary-Ann . " It 's positively coquettish the way the top two buttons of his shirt are always missing . " She was relieved . " Men are so vain , " she said , looking at him fondly . " But in America only women are supposed to worry about their appearance . The real man never looks into a mirror . That 's effeminate . . . . " I teased them . " Well , that 's changing , I guess . " Mary-Ann brought Rusty 's hands to her lips . " And I 'm just as glad . I think men are beautiful . " " So does Rusty , " I could not help but observe . " Oh , shit , Miss Myra , " was the boyish response . Soon . Soon . Soon.  |p150BUCK  LONER REPORTS  --  Recording Disc No. 777  --  ' 8 MarchFlagler and Flagler have come up with dynamite or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman apparently the Mon terrey Mexican marriage certificate is a phony and there is no record from what they can find out of her being married down there but weve been burned before I said to Flagler Junior who is working on the case shell just go out and prove they lost the records or something and then that doctor friend of hers will swear he was a witness which is what it sounded like on the long distance telephone call that was bugged and what do we do then I ask you ques tion mark well Flagler Junior seems to think they are on solid ground with the Mexicans though he admits that our little brown friends are not only kind of confused in the paper works department but if Myra thinks of it and shell think of it the bitch they can be bribed to say that there was a marriagep151when there wasnt so meanwhile I am biding my time until tomorrow when there should be a full final report from Mexico that there really isnt a rec ord of this marriage in question period paragraph Flagler Juniors New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his report is on my desk now as I dictate while being massaged by Milly who is the best masseuse in the whole business I mean that Milly you little angel thats right rub good and hard it takes time but when it comes the Buck Loner Special strike that period paragraph interesting con versation with Letitia who thinks that Mary Ann Pringle properly handled could make it as a record ing star and she will make some appointments all this is Myras doing she is meddling into everything trying to force the kids out into the cold world when their place is here protected and looked after I know how well I know showbiz and all its heartbreaks and Mary Ann will end up like all the others which is nowhere a waitress some place assuming she does nt get lucky and marry some guy who will take care of her and cherish her the way Buck Loners Acad my does that guy certainly wont be Rusty whos a wild number the Sheriffs office just asked me to keep an eye on him and I told him so yesterday told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the hoosegow for him he was real shook up and asked me not to tell anybody about his scrape in Mexico and I said nobody knows but me and Myra who happened to be checking into his file and read the Sheriffs last letter to me that woman is into everything Rusty seemed upset by this I guess be cause he thinks Myra will tell Mary Ann well its no business of mine and thats for sure Milly you are the best ever and if you keep that up theres a big surprise coming your way strike that period parap152graph Myra asked permission to use the infirmary tonight God knows why I suppose she is mixing up some poison which it is my prayer she takes Jesus Milly do nt stop Milly Jesus Millyp153I am sitting in the infirmary , a small antiseptic white room with glass cabinets containing all sorts of drugs and wicked-looking instruments . Against one wall is an examinationtable which can be raised or lowered . It is now some four feet above the floor and tilted at a slight angle . Next to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width . I am seated at a small surgical table , making notes while I wait for Rusty . It is ten o'clock at night . The Academy building is dark . The students are gone . No one will disturb us . I am astonished at my own calm . All of my life 's hunger is about to be fed . I am as serene as a great surgeon preparing to make the necessary incision that will root out the problem . This morning , after Posture class , I took Rusty to one side . He has been friendly and smiling ever since our dinnerat the Cock and Bull and now treats me in the confi/dent condescending way that the ordinary young man treats an ordinary girl . I put a stop to that . His grinning face went pale when I said coldly , " There 's been no improvement , Rusty . None at all . You 're not trying to walk straight . " " Honest to God I am , Miss Myra , why I even practicedlast night with Mary-Ann , she 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed genuinely hurt that I had not recognized his effort . I was somewhat kinder in my manner , sharp but in the Eve Arden way . " I 'm sure you have tried . But you need special attention and I think I can give it . I 'll expect you at the infirmary at ten o'clock tonight . " " The infirmary ? " He looked almost as puzzled as James Craig in the sixth reel of Kismet . " I 've arranged everything with Uncle Buck . He agrees with me that you need extra help . " " But what kind of help ? " He was still puzzled but , as yet , unsuspicious . " You 'll see . " I started to go . He stopped me . " Look , I 've got a date with Mary-Ann for dinner . " " Postpone it . You see her every night after dinner anyway . " " Well , yes . But we were invited some place at ten . " " Then go at eleven . I 'm sorry . But this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be a star , do n't you ? " That was always the clincher in dealing with any of the students . They have been conditioned from childhood in the knowledge that to achieve stardom theyp155might be called upon to do anything , and of course they would do anything because stardom is everything and worth any humiliation or anguish . So the saints must have felt in the days of Christendom , as they burned to death with their eyes on heaven where the true stars shine . I spent all afternoon making my preparations . I have the entire procedure worked out to the last detail . When I have finished , I shall have achieved in life every dream andp156I must write it all down now . Exactly as it happened . While it is fresh in my memory . But my hand trembles . Why ? Twice I 've dropped the yellow ballpoint pen . Now I sit at the surgical table , making the greatest effort to calm myself , to put it all down not only for its own sake but also for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act out totally his fantasies and survive . Certainly your own guilty longing to kill the nerve in each of Lyndon Johnson 's twenty-odd teeth without the use of anesthetic can never in this life be achieved , and so your dreams must feed upon pale surrogateswhile mine have been made reality . Shortly after ten , Rusty arrived . He wore the usual checked shirt with two buttons missing and no T-shirt , as well as chino trousers and highly polished cowboy boots . He looked about the infirmary curiously . " I never been in here before . "  | " That explains why there 's no physical record of you. , , " Never been sick a day in my life . " Oh , he was proud ! No doubt of that . " But even so , the Academy requires a record . It 's one of Uncle Buck 's rules . " " Yeah . I know . And I 've been meaning to drop in sometime and see the Doc . " " Perhaps that wo n't be necessary . " I placed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sit down . " I was pleasant . He sat in a chair so close to mine that our knees touched . Quickly he swung his legs wide so that my knees were now between his and there was no possibility of further contact . It was plain that in no way do I attract him . We chatted a moment about Mary-Ann , and about Letitia 's interest in her career . I could see that Rusty was both pleased and envious , a normal reaction . Then , delicately , I got around to the subject of Mexico ; he became visibly nervous . Finally , I told him that I knew what had happened . " You wo n't tell Mary-Ann , will you ? " That was his first response . " It would just kill her . " " Of course I wo n't . And of course I 'll give a good report to Mr. Martinson , your parole officer . " He was startled . " You know him ? " " Oh , yes , " I lied  --  actually I happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , he 's asked me to keep an eye on you , and I said I would . " " I hope you tell him that I sure as hell am reformed . " He was vehement.  | " I will  --  if you really are , and behave yourself , and let me try to help you with your problem . " " Of course I will , Miss Myra . You know that . " He looked entirely sincere , blue eyes round as a boy 's . Perhapshe is an actor after all . " Now then , about your back . I 've talked to the chiropractorwho will arrange for a special brace . He could n't be here tonight but he asked me to take an exact tracing of your spine and then he 'll know what to do . So now if you 'll just slip off that shirt , we 'll get to work . " Resignedly , he got to his feet . Automatically his hands went to his belt buckle in order to loosen it but then , obviously recalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , pulling off the shirt with a certain arrogant ease . The belt just covered his navel ; otherwise he was in exactly the same state as he had been at the beginning of our first session . I was pleased that my visual recollection of him was so precise . I remembered in exact detail the tracery design of bronze hair across the pale chest , as well as the small roselike inverted nipples . " Stand on the scales , please . " I imitated the chilliest of trained nurses . " Face to the wall and we 'll measure you . " He put one foot on the scales , when I stopped him . " Take off those atrocious cowboy boots ! They 'll break the machine . " " Oh , no they wo n't , why . . . " He started to argue . " Rusty ! " I was sharp . " Do exactly as I tell you . You do n't want me to tell Mr. Martinson that you 've been uncooperative , do you ? " " No . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then thep159other , he awkwardly pulled off the boots . He wore white cotton socks ; one had a large hole in it through which the big toe protruded . He grinned sheepishly . " Guess I 'm full of holes . " " That 's all right . " The small room was now full of the not unpleasant odor of warm leather . Obediently he got onto the scales exactly as I directed , face to the wall . In a most professional way , I measured the width of the chest , and then allowed myself the pleasure of running my hand down the smooth warm back , tracing the spine 's curve right to the point where it vanished , frustratingly , into the white chinos as they swelled just below my hand , masking those famous inviolatebuttocks . " All right , " I said , marking down figures on the physicalexamination chart . " Now we need your weight which is one seventy-four and your height which is six one and a quarter . The chart 's filling up nicely . All right , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was surprisingly at ease : obviously our dinner at the Cock and Bull had given him confidence . " This doctor can really fix me with something that will work ? " He was genuinely curious . " He thinks he can , yes . Of course , he 'll have to fit you himself . This is just the preliminary examination which , while we 're at it , Uncle Buck said I should turn into an ordinary physical and so kill two birds with one stone , as he put it in his colorful way . " " You mean like height and weight and that stuff ? " As yet he showed no particular alarm.  | " Exactly , " I said , ready now to begin to shake his selfconfidence . I took a small bottle . " That means a urine specimen . " The look of surprise was exquisite as he took the bottle . " Go behind that screen . " I indicated a white screen in one corner of the room . " But . . . " he began . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he went behind the screen which was waist-high . He turned and faced the wall ; he fumbled with his trousers . Then there was a long moment of complete silence . " What 's the matter ? " I asked . " I . . . do n't know . I guess I 'm what they call pee-shy . " " Do n't be . Just relax . We 've got plenty of time . " The thought of " plenty of time " had a most releasing effect . Water passed into the bottle with a surging sound . He then rearranged his clothes and brought me the specimenwhich I took ( marveling at the warmth of the glass : we are furnaces inside ! ) and carefully placed on it a white sticker inscribed with his name . The entire affair was conducted without a false note . " Now then we 'll just do a drawing of the spine . Loosen your belt and lie face down on the table . " For the first time he seemed aware that history might repeat itself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor . " " Rusty , " I was patient but firm . " I 'm just following doctor 's orders and you are going to follow my orders , or else . Is that understood ? " " Well , yes , but ... "  | " There are no buts ' for someone on probation . " " Yes , ma'am ! " He got the point . Quickly he undid the belt buckle ; then he unfastened the catch to his trousers and , holding them firmly in place , lay face-down on the table . It was a delicious sight , that slender muscular body stretched to its full length as sacrifice to some cruel goddess . His arms were at his sides , and I noticed with some amusement that he was pressing the palms hard against the table , instinctively repeating his earlier performance . I covered his back with a large sheet of paper . Then with an eyebrow pencil , I slowly traced the spine 's course from the nape of the neck to the line of his trousers . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my own ears exactly like Laraine Day , an all-time favorite . " It sort of tickles , " came a muffled voice . Triceps muscleswrithed beneath silk-smooth skin . " Are you ticklish ? " This suddenly opened an unexpectedvista . Fortunately my program was so designed as to include an occasional inspired improvisation . " Well , no , not really ... " But I had already taken one large sweaty foot in hand ( again marveling at the body heat through the thin sock ) and delicately tickled the base of the toes . The effect was electric . The whole body gave a sudden twitch . With a powerful reflex , he kicked the foot from my hand , exclaiming " Cut that out ! " in a masterful voice , so entirely had he forgotten his place . I was mild . " Do that again , Rusty , and I will punish you . "  | " I 'm sorry , Miss Myra . " He was conciliatory . He looked at me over his shoulder ( the tracing paper had fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I thought . " " Apparently . Or perhaps I hurt you . You do n't have athlete 's foot , do you ? " " Oh , no . No . Not for a long time . . . in the summer , sometimes . . . " " We 'll just take a look . " With some difficulty , I slipped off the damp socks . If I were a foot-fetishist like poor Myron , I would have been in seventh heaven . As it was , what excited me was his profound embarrassment , for he has the American male 's horror of smelling bad . Actually , he was relatively odorless . " You must have just had a shower , " I said . Ile buried his face in the table . " Yeah . . . just now . " Carefully I examined each toe , holding it tight as though I feared that , at any moment , one of the little piggies might decide to run all the way home . But except for a certain rigidity of the body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not even when I examined each pink toe . " Good , " I said , putting the foot down . " You 're learningcontrol . Ticklishness is a sign of sexual fear , did you know that ? " A faint " no " from the head of the table . " That 's why I was so surprised at the way you reacted when I touched your foot . From what you said at the Cock and Bull I could n't imagine you ever being tense with a woman . " " I guess you sort of took me by surprise , " was the best that he could think to say . In his present position , he ob/viously did not want to be reminded of his usual cockiness . " I 'm sorry , " I said , deftly sliding his trousers down to his knees . As I had anticipated , he gave a slight gasp but made no move other than to grip with both hands the sides of the trousers in an effort to keep at least his front decently covered . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous buttocks curved beneath frayed jockey shorts . Below the elastic , two round holes , like eyes , revealedfair skin . Teasingly , I put my finger in one of the holes . He winced at the touch . " Does n't Mary-Ann ever mend your clothes ? " " She . . . ca n't . . . sew . . . " He sounded as if he had been running hard , and could not get his breath . But at least he had steeled himself for my next move . The total unveiling of the buttocks was accomplished in an absolute , almost religious , silence . They were glorious . Under the direct overhead light , I was able to appreciatephysical details that I had missed in the office . A tiny dark mole on one cheek . An angry red pimple just inside the crack where a hair had grown in upon itself . The iridescent quality of the skin which was covered with the most delicate pale peach fuzz , visible only in a strong light and glittering now with new sweat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also noted that although I had pulled the Jockey shorts down to the thighs in the back , he had craftily contrived to hold them up in front , and so his honor , he believed , was only half lost.  |p164Intimately  I passed my hand over the hard buttocks , firmly locked to all intruders , and remarked , according to plan , " You are n't feverish , are you ? " " No . . . I 'm O.K. . . . " The voice was barely audible . With my free hand I felt his brow ; it was bathed in perspiration . " You are hot . We 'd better take your temperature . Besides , they want it for the chart . " As I went over to the surgical table and prepared the thermometer , he watched me dully , like a trapped animal . Then I returned to my quarry and , putting one hand on each cheek at the exact point where buttock joins thigh , I said , " Relax now . " He raised up on his arms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What ? " " I 've got to take your temperature , Rusty . " " But . . . there ? " His voice broke like a teenage boy 's . " Of course . Now then . . . " " But why ca n't you use the other kind , you know , in the mouth . . . " With the back of my left hand , I struck him hard across the bottom . He gasped , pulled back . " There is more where that came from , " I said coldly , noting with pleasure a certain darkening of skin where the blood had been brought to the surface by the force of my blow . " Yes , ma'am . " Defeated , the head returned to its position on the table and once again I put my hands on those firm cheeks . " Now , " I said , " relax the muscle . " I could feel beneath my fingers the muscles slowly , reluctantly go slack.  |p165I  confess I was now trembling with excitement . Gently , carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all  --  was revealed . Normally at moments of great victory , there is a sense of letdown . But not in this case . For one thing I had half feared to find him not clean  --  unlike so many anal erotics I am not at all attracted by fecal matter , quite the reverse in fact . Yet had he not been tidy , his humiliation would have been total . So I was torn between conflicting desires . As it turned out , his shower had been thorough . The sphincter resembled a tiny pale pink tea rose , or perhaps a kitten 's nose and mouth . From its circumference , like the rays of a sunburst , bronze hairs reflected the overhead light . The only disappointment was that he had craftily managed to arrange his scrotum so that it was entirely out of view , only a thick tuft of hair at the junctureof the groin indicating the direction in which it could be found . But sufficient to the moment are the revelationsthereof . I squeezed some lubricant from a tube onto my index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A tremor went through his whole body  --  the term " fleshquake " occurred to me : so Atlantis must have shuddered before the fall ! Carefully , daintily , I applied the lubricant to the silky puckered surface . He held himself quite rigid , again not breathing . Then I grew bolder . I inserted my finger into the tight hot place as far as it would go . I must have touched the prostate for he suddenly groaned , but said nothing . Then , either deliberately or through uncontrollable reflex , he brought the full force of his youthful muscular/ity to bear on the sphincter muscle and for a moment it felt as though my finger might be nipped off . With my free hand , I slapped his right buttock smartly . " Relax ! " I commanded . He mumbled something I could not hear and the sphincter again loosened . I then removed my finger and inserted the thermometer , after first teasing the virginal orifice with delicate probes that made him squirm . Once the thermometer was in , it was completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legs were only slightly spread , his cheeks promptly came together when I let them go . I then took up the chart and read off a list of childhood diseases . Chicken pox , measles , whooping cough .. . and he whispered " yes " or " no " or " I do n't remember " in response to the catechism . When I was finished , I said , " All in all , a healthy young boy . " My cold cheery manner was calculated to increase his alarm ; obviously it did for not once would he look at me , preferring to stare at the wall just opposite , chin pushed hard against the table . " Now let 's see what 's cooking . " I pushed open the checks and slowly removed the thermometer . He was normal of course but I saw fit to lie : " Just as I thought , you do have a touch of fever . Well , we 'll soon take care of that . Now roll over on your back . " He did as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front ; nevertheless , the line of his belt was two inches below the navel and could not , in his present position , be pulled higher . As a result , the timberline of pubichair was briefly revealed , briefly because he promptly placed both hands over himself in an attempt to hide the quarry from the hunter 's approach.  |p167On  his back , bare feet pointed and chest streaked with sweat , he seemed smaller than in fact he was , already more boy than man , despite the mature muscularity of the torso . The process of diminishing was well begun . He looked up at me , apprehensively . " Is there much more I got to do ? " " We must both follow the chart . " I was enigmatic as I picked up a wooden tongue depressor . " Open your mouth . " He obeyed . I pressed down the pink tongue until he gagged , noting , as I did , the whiteness of the teeth and the abnormal salivation that fear sometimes creates . " You take good care of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliment the stern nurse gives a child . " Your body , too . I was happily surprised to find that you were clean in places most boys your age neglect . " Carefully I was reducing his status from man to boy to child to  --  ah , the triumph ! He responded numbly to the progression , blinking with embarrassment . " Now put your hands behind your head . " Slowly he obeyed , aware that I could now see at least a quarter of an inch of dark pubic hair , surprisingly thick and in texturecoarser than the fine hairs on the rest of his body . A pulse just above the navel beat rapidly , causing the entire stomach to quiver like some frightened small beast . I let my hand rest lightly on his navel . Crisp hairs tickled my palm as I in turn tickled them . I could feel the pounding of the blood in his arteries . The sense of power was overwhelming . I felt as if , in some way , it was I who controlled the coursing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command that the heart beat at all . I felt that I could do anything.  | " You seem nervous , Rusty . " I challenged him . He swallowed hard . " No . . . no , Miss Myra . No , I 'm not really . It 's just that it 's kind of hot in here ... " " And you 're not enjoying your examination . " " Well , it 's kind of strange , you know . . . . " His voice trailed off nervously . " What 's kind of strange ? " " Well , you know . . . I mean having a girl . . . you know , a lady , like you , do all this to a guy . " " Have n't you ever been examined by a nurse ? " " Never ! " This reversion to the old masculine Rusty was promptly quelled by the sudden tug I gave to his Jockey shorts ; the full bush was now visible , though nothing else for the shorts were stopped at the crucial juncture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I felt the different sections of his belly , taking pleasure in the firmness of muscles , hard rubber beneath silk . I lingered for quite some time over the pubic area , taking the powerful pulse of each of the two arteries that meet at the groin . I could not , however , make out even the base of his penis . I then took an instrument which resembled sugar tongs , used to test the thickness of the skin 's subcutaneous layer . With frightened eyes , he watched as I picked away at the skin of his belly , pulling the skin as high as I could and then releasing it with a snap . " Nicely resilient , " I said , pinching hard as I could a fold of his belly and causing him to cry out plaintively , " Hey , that hurts ! " The return to childhood was well underway . " Stop being such a baby ! " Delicately I took one of hisp169nipples in the tongs . He shrank from me , but the tongs pursued . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feather touch , I teased the tiny inverted nipple , making him writhe at the tickling pleasure it gave him . Then , suddenly , the nipple was erect . I then teased the other nipple , manipulating the golden aureole of hairs until it , too , ceased to be concave . A glassy look came into his eyes ; for the first time an erogenous zone had been explored and exploited ( I do not count the probing of his sphincter which , in the context of my investigation , did not arouse him , rather the reverse ) . I looked at the front of his trousers to see if there was any sudden , swelling but I could detect nothing . " You had better slip off those trousers , " I said . " They 're getting badly creased , the way you 're sweat-ing . " " Oh , that 's O.K. " His voice cracked again . " Flurry up ! We have n't got all night . " Grimly he sat up and pulled his trousers down over his knees . I pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . When I turned back to my victim , I was surprised to find him sitting up on the table , poised for flight . He had trickily used the turning of my back to restore his shorts to their normal position . Sitting as he was , bare legs danglingover the table , I could see nothing of the crotch , concealed by muscular thighs pressed close together while both hands rested protectively in his lap . He was not goingto surrender the last bastion without a struggle . " I did n't tell you to sit up , did I ? " I was cold . " But I thought you were through with me here . " Thep170timbre of the voice had become light ; he sounded like a pubescent boy trying to escape punishment . " You 're not finished until I say you are . All right . Stand up . Over here . In front of me . " He got to his feet and approached to within a foot of me . There he stood , awkwardly , hands crossed in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportionedas the rest of him , though somewhat overdevelopedin the thighs , no doubt the result of playing football . He was so close to me that I could feel the heat of his flesh and smell the healthy earthlike aroma the young male body exudes . " Rest your arms at your sides and at least try to stand straight . " He obeyed . The target was now directly in front of me , seated in front of him , at eye level . As I stared straight at the hidden area , he clenched his fists nervously , and shifted from foot to foot . The frayed Jockey shorts were unfortunately too loose to reveal more than a large rounded area , without clear definition ; they were , however , splotched with fresh urine . " Look ! You wet yourself ! " I pinched the damp cloth , careful to touch nothing beneath . I-le gave a start . " I guess I did . I was in a hurry . " " Boys are so careless about those things . " We had gone from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the examination card . " Oh yes ! Have you ever had a venereal disease ? " " Oh , no , ma'am . Never ! " " I hope you 're telling me the truth . " I was ominous as I wrote " no " on the chart . " We have ways of finding out , you know . "  | " Honest I never have . I always been careful . . . al-ways . " " Always ? Just exactly when did you begin with girls ? " " When ? " He looked at me dumbly . " How old were you ? " " Thirteen , I guess . I do n't remember . " " Was she older than you ? " He nodded . " In high school . She was a Protestant , " he added wildly . " Did she make the advances ? " " Yes . Kind of . She 'd show me hers if I showed her mine . You know , kid stuff . " " And you liked what you saw ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant across the frightened face . " Did she like what she saw ? " The smile went , as he was reminded of his situation . " Well , there was no complaints . " " Would you say that you were well developed for your age ? " " I guess so . I do n't know . " " Did you masturbate often ? " The face went red . " Well . . . maybe some . I guess all guys do . " " What about now ? " " Now ? Oh , no . Why should I ? " " You mean Mary-Ann is quite enough to satisfy you ? " " Yes . And I do n't cheat on her . " " How often do you come with her in a night ? "  |p172He  gulped . " That 's awful personal . . . " I took the measuring stick and with a great cracking sound struck his right thigh . He yelled . Fear and reproachin his face , as he rubbed the hurt skin . " There 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He accepted defeat . " I guess I can go four or five times but mostly we just go a couple times because , you see , we have to get up so early . . . " " Then you are quite a stud , as they say out here . " " Oh , I do n't know . . . " He gestured helplessly . " Would you say that your penis was larger than mostboys ' your age or smaller ? " I le began to tremble , aware of the prey I was stalking . " Christ , 1 do n't know . I mean how could I know ? " " You see the other boys in the shower , and you were an athlete , after all . " " I guess I did n't look . . . " " But surely you must occasionally have taken a peep . " I looked straight at the worn cotton which hid the subject of my inquiry . Both of his hands twitched , as though he wanted to protect himself . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . honest . " This of course was a lie since in every known society the adolescent male spends a great deal of time worriedly comparing himself with other males . " You 're unusually modest . " I was dry . " Now I am supposed to check you for hernia . So if you 'll just pull down those shorts . . . " " But I do n't have hernia , " he gabbled . " I was allp173checked out by this prison doctor in Mexico , and he said I was just fine in that department . " " But it does no harm to double-check . So if you 'll slip them down ... " " Honest , I 'm O.K. " He was sweating heavily . " Rusty , I get the impression that for some mysteriousreason you do n't want me to examine your genitals . Exactlywhat mischief are you trying to hide from me ? " " Nothing , honest ! I got nothing to hide . . . " " Then why are you so afraid to let me examine you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman and I 'm a man ... " " A boy , technically . . . " " A boy , O.K. , and , well , it 's just wrong . " " Then you 're shy . " " Sure , I 'm shy about that , in front of a lady . " " But surely you are n't shy with all those girls you 've  --  what 's that word of yours ?  --  boffed ' ? " " But that 's different , when you 're both making love , that 's O.K. " " Baffling , " I said . I frowned as though trying to find some way out of our dilemma . " Naturally , I want to respectyour modesty . At the same time I must complete the examination . " I paused ; then I gave the appearance of having reached a decision . " All right . You wo n't have to remove your shorts ... " He gave a sigh of relief . . . too soon . " However , I shall have to insert my hand inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart . " " Oh . " Dismay and defeat . " I think you 'll agree that 's a statesmanlike compro/mise . " On that bright note , I slid my left hand up the inside of his left thigh . He wriggled involuntarily as I forced my fingers past the leg opening of the shorts . The scrotum 's heat was far greater than that of the thigh , I noticed , and the hairs were soaked with sweat . Carefully I took his left testicle in my hand . It was unusuallylarge and firm to the touch , though somewhat loose in the sac , no doubt due to his overheated condition . Delicately I fingered the beloved enemy , at last in my power . Then I looked up and saw that Rusty 's eyes were screwed shut , as though anticipating pain . I gave it to him . I maneuvered the testicle back and forth until I had found the hole from which , in boyhood , it had so hopefully descended . I shoved it back up into the hole . Iie groaned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the gagging , I could feel the entire scrotum contract like a terrified beast , seeking escape . When he gagged again and seemed on the verge of actually being sick , I let the testicle fall back into its normal place and took my hand away . " Jesus , " he whispered . " I almost threw up . " " I 'm sorry . But I have to be thorough . I 'll be gentler this time . " Again my hand pushed past the damp cloth and seized the right testicle , which was somewhat smaller than the left . As I maneuvered it gently about , my forefingerstrayed and struck the side of something thick and smooth , rooted in wiry hair . He shuddered , but continued to suffer at my hands . I slipped the right testicle into its ancient place and held it there until I. sensed he was about to gag . Then I let it drop and removed my hand.  |p175He  gave a deep sigh . " I guess that 's it . " " Yes , I think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigh , he sat down on the chair opposite me and clumsily pulled on one sock , tearing the flimsy material ; the toes went through the tip . " You 're very clumsy . " I observed . " Yes , ma'am . " He agreed , quickly pulling on the other sock , not wanting in any way to cross me , so eager was he to escape . " Oh , here 's a question we forgot . " I was incredibly sunny . " Have you been circumcised ? " The foot he was holding on his knee slid to the floor . Quickly he pressed his thighs together , wadded up his shirt , and covered the beleaguered lap . " Why , no , ma'am . I never was . " " So few Polish boys are , I 'm told . " I made a check on the chart . " Does the skin pull back easily ? " " Oh , sure ! " He was beet-red . " Sure . I 'm O.K. MaryAnn'swaiting . " " Not so fast . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission to dress , you know . " " But I thought you were finished . . . . " The deep voice was now a whine . " I was . But your jumping the gun like that makes me very suspicious . " " Suspicious ? " He was bewildered . " Yes . First , I let you talk me out of giving you the venereal disease examination , and now you 're suddenly getting dressed , without permission , just when the subjectonce more has to do with your penis . Rusty , I am very , very suspicious . "  |p176The  blue eyes filled with tears as he sensed what was approaching . " Do n't be , Miss Myra . Believe me , I 'm absolutelyO.K . . . . " " We have to think of Mary-Ann , too , you know . You could make her very sick just through your careless-ness . " " Honest to God , I 'm O.K. They even gave me the Wassermann test in the jail . . . . " He jabbered nervously . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mr. Martinson will tell you . I was a hundred per cent O.K. " " But Mr. Martinson is n't here while you are , and frankly I do n't see how I can omit this part of the examination . Stand up please and put down that shirt . " " Oh , come on , please do n't . . . " His voice broke again , close to a sob . " Do as I say . " On that note of icy command , he stood up slowly and like a man going to his execution  --  or a schoolboy to his spanking  --  he put down the shirt and stood dumbly facingmc . " Come over here . " He came to within a few inches of where I was sitting ; he was so close that my knees touched the warm fur of his shins . " Now let 's see what kind of stud you really are . " " Please . . . " He whispered . " I do n't want to . It is n't right . " Deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled them slowly , slowly down , enjoyingeach station of his shame . The first glimpse was en/couraging . The base of the penis sprouted from the bronze bush at an angle of almost forty-five degrees , an earnest of vitality . It was well over an inch wide , always a good sign , with one large blue vein down the center , again promising . But another three inches of slow unveilingrevealed Rusty 's manhood in its entirety , I slid the shorts to the floor . When I looked up at his face , I saw that once again the eyes were shut , the lips trembling . Then I carefully examined the object of my long and arduous hunt , at last captive . A phrase of Myron 's occurred to me : " all potatoesand no meat . " Rusty 's balls were unusually large and impressive ; one lower than the other , as they hung bulllikein the rather loose scrotal sac . They were all that I could desire . The penis , on the other hand , was not a success , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me see just how short it is . On the other hand both base and head are uncommonly thick and , as Myron always said , thickness not length is how you gauge the size of the ultimate erection . The skin was dead white with several not undecorative veins , while the foreskin covered the entire head , meeting at the tip in an irregular rosy pucker , plainly cousin to the sphincter I had so recently probed . " I 'm afraid , Rusty , that you 've been somewhat oversoldon the campus . Poor Mary-Ann . That 's a boy 's equipment . " This had the desired effect of stinging him into a manly response . " Ai n't been no complaints , " he growled . But as he did , both testicles rose in their sac as thoughp178seeking an escape hatch in case of battle , while the penis betrayed him by visibly shrinking into the safety of the brush . " Next you 'll tell me that it 's not the size that counts but what you do . " I followed verbal insult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . He dared not move , or speak , or even cry out . The shock had reduced him exactly as planned . I had also confirmed an old theory that although the " normal " male delights in exposing himself to females who attract him he is , conversely , terrified to do so in front of those he dislikes or fears , as though any knowledge they might obtain of the center of his being will create bad magic and hence unman him . In any case , the grail was in my hand at last , smooth , warm , soft . My joy was complete as I slid back the skin , exposing the shiny deep rose of the head which was impressively large and beautifully shaped , giving some credence to the legend that , in action , its owner ( already Rusty had beconica mere appendage to this reality ) was a formidable lover . IIe was sweaty but clean ( I was so close to him that I could smell the strong but not disagreeable fernlike odor of genitals ) . Delicately but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye open . Not one tear was shed . " Apparently , you are all right , " I observed as he looked down with horror at my hand which held him firmly in its grasp , the glans penis exposed like a summer rose . " You 're also clean but beyond that I 'm afraid you 're something of a disappointment . " The penis again shrank in my hand . " But of course you 're probably still grow/ing . " The humiliation was complete . There was nothing that he could say . In actual fact , the largeness of the head had already convinced me that what I said was untrue , but policy dictated that I be scornful . " Nov then , let 's see how free the foreskin is . " I slid the skin forward , then back . He shuddered . " Now , you do it a few times . " To his relief , I let him go . Clumsily he took himself in one hand as though never before had he touched this strange object , so beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin , looking for all the world like a child frightened in the act of masturbating . " Come on , " I said , " you can do better than that . " " He changed his grip to the one he obviously used when alone . His hand worked rapidly as he pumped himselflike one of those machines that extract oil from the earth , milk from the cow , water from shale . After several minutes of intense and rhythmic massage I noted , with some surprise , that though the head had become a bit larger and darker , the stem had not changed in size . Apparentlyhe knew how to restrain himself . He continued for another minute or two , the only sound in the room his heavy breathing and the soft waterlike sound of skin slapping against skin ; then he stopped . " You see , " he said . " It works O.K. " " But I did n't tell you to stop . " " But if I keep on . . . I mean . . . well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A boy , " I corrected . " A boy 's going to . . . to ... " " To what ? "  | " Get . . . excited . " " Go right ahead . I 'd be amused to see what Mary-Ann sees in you . " Without another word , grimly , he set to work and continued for some time , sweating hard . But still we were denied the full glory . Some lengthening and thickeningtook place but not to the fullest degree . " Is anything wrong ? " I asked sweetly . " I do n't know . " He gulped , trying to catch his breath . " It ca n't . . . wo n't . . . " He was incoherent at the double humiliation . " Do you often have this problem with Mary-Ann ? " I sounded as compassionate as Kay Francis , as warm as June Allyson . " Never ! I swear ... " " Five times in one night and now this ! Really , you young boys are such liars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what 's wrong . . . . " He beat at himself as though through sheer force he could tap the well of generation . But it was no use . Finally I told him to stop . Then I took over , practicing a number of subtle pressures and frictions learned from Myron . . . all to no avail . In a curious way the absence of an erection , though not part of the plan , gave me an unexpected thrill : to have so cowed my victim as to short-circuit his legendarypowers as a stud was , psychologically , far more fulfillingthan my original intention . While I was vigorously shaking him , he made the longexpectedmove that would complete the drama , the holy passion of Myra Breckinridge.  | " Do you . . . " He began tentatively , looking down at me and the loose-stemmed rose that I held in my hand . " Do I what ? " " Do you want me to . . . well , to ball you ? " The deliverywas superb , as shy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go of him as though in horror . " Rusty ! Do you know who you 're talking to ? " " Yes , Miss Myra . I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to offend you . . . . " " What sort of woman do you think I am ? " I took the heavy balls in my hand , like an offering . " These belong to Mary-Ann , and no one else , and if I ever catch you playing around with anybody else , I 'll see that Mr. Martinsonputs you away for twenty years . " He turned white . " I 'm sorry . I did n't know . I thought maybe . . . the way you were . . . doing what you were doing . . . . I 'm sorry , really . " The voice stopped . " You have every reason to be sorry . " Again I let him go ; the large balls swung back between his legs , and continuedgently to sway , like a double pendulum . " In any case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  ball me , ' it 's very plain that you could n't . As a stud , you 're a disas-ter . " He flushed at the insult but said nothing . I was now ready for my master stroke . " However , as a lesson , I shall ball you . " He was entirely at sea . " Ball me ? How ? " " Put out your hands . " He did so and I bound them together with surgical gauze . Not for nothing had I once been a nurses ' aide.  | " What 're you doing that for ? " Alarm growing . With a forefinger , I flicked the scrotal sac , making him cry out from shock . " No questions , my boy . " When the hands were firmly secured , I lowered the examination table until it was just two feet from the floor . " Lie down , " I ordered . " On your stomach . " Mystified , he did as he was told . I then tied his bound hands to the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , entirely in my power . If I had wanted , I could have killed him . But my fantasies have never involved murder or even physical suffering for I have a horror of blood , preferring to inflict pain in more subtle ways , destroying totally , for instance , a man 's idea of himself in relation to the triumphant sex . " Now then , up on your knees . " " But . . . " A hard slap across the buttocks put an end to all objections . He pulled himself up on his knees , legs tight together and buttocks clenched shut . He resembled a pyramid whose base was his head and white-socked feet , and whose apex was his rectum . I was now ready for the final rite . " Legs wide apart , " I commanded . Reluctantly , he moved his knees apart so that they lined up with the exactedges of the table . I was now afforded my favorite view of the male , the heavy rosy scrotum dangling from the groin above which the tiny sphincter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mystery that even Mary-Ann has never seen , much less violated . " What 're you doing ? " The voice was light as a child 's . True terror had begun.  | " Now remember the secret is to relax entirely . Otherwiseyou could be seriously hurt . " I then pulled up my skirt to reveal , strapped to my groin , Clem 's dildo which I borrowed yesterday on the pretext that I wanted it copied for a lamp base . Clem had been most amused . Rusty cried out with alarm . " Oh , no ! For God 's sake , do n't . " " Now you will find out what it is the girl feels when you play the man with her . " " Jesus , you 'll split me ! " The voice was treble with fear . As I approached him , dildo in front of me like the god Priapus personified , he tried to wrench free of his bonds , but failed . Then he did the next best thing , and brought his knees together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no use . I spread him wide and put my battering ram to the gate . For a moment I wondered if he might not be right about the splitting : the opening was the size of a dime while the dildo was over two inches wide at the head and nearly a foot long . But then I recalled how Myron used to have no trouble in accommodating objects this size or larger , and what the fragile Myron could do so could the inexperienced but sturdy Rusty . I pushed . The pink lips opened . The tip of the head entered and stopped . " I ca n't , " Rusty moaned . " honestly I ca n't . It 's too big . " " Just relax , and you 'll stretch . Do n't worry . " He made whatever effort was necessary and thep184pursed lips became a grin allowing the head to enter , but not without a gasp of pain and shock . Once inside , I savored my triumph . I had avenged Myron . A lifetime of being penetrated had brought him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was able , as Woman Triumphant , to destroy the adored destroyer . Holding tight to Rusty 's slippery hips , I plunged deeper . He cried out with pain . But I was inexorable . I pushed even farther into him , triggering the prostate gland , for when I felt between his legs , I discovered that the erection he had not been able to present me with had now , inadvertently , occurred . The size was most respectable , and hard as metal . But when I plunged deeper , the penis went soft with pain , and he cried out again , begged me to stop , but now I was like a woman possessed , riding , riding , riding my sweating stallion into forbidden country , shouting with joy as I experienced my own sort of orgasm , oblivious to his staccato shrieks as I delved and spanned that innocent flesh . Oh , it was a holy moment ! I was one with the Bacchae , with all the priestesses of the dark bloody cults , with the great goddess herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminine made flesh , the source of life and its destroyer , dealing with man as incidental toy , whose blood as well as semen is needed to make me whole ! There was blood at the end . And once my passion had spent itself , I was saddened and repelled . I had not meant actually to tear the tender flesh but apparently I had , and the withdrawing of my weapon brought with it bright blood . He did not stir as I washed him clean ( like a lov/ing mother ) , applying medicine to the small cut , insertinggauze ( how often had I done this for Myron ! ) . Then I unbound him . Shakily , he stood up , rubbing tears from his swollen face . In silence he dressed while I removed the harness of the dildo and put it away in the attache case . Not until he was finally dressed did he speak . " Can I go now ? " " Yes . You can go now . " I sat down at the surgical table and took out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Are n't you going to thank me for the troubleI 've taken ? " He looked at me , face perfectly blank . Then , tonelessly , he murmured , " Thank you , ma'am , " and went . And so it was that Myra Breckinridge achieved one of the great victories for her sex . But one which is not yet entirely complete even though , alone of all women , I know what it is like to be a goddess enthroned , and allpowerful.  |p186I  sit now at the card table . Through the window I can see the turning chorus girl in front of the Chateau Marmont ; only she is not turning . A power failure ? are they making repairs ? or is she at last being dismantled ? The question takes on symbolic importance since she is , to me , Hollywood . She must never not be allowed to dominatethe Strip . Rusty did not appear at school today . I would have been disappointed if he had . But what did distress me was Mary-Ann 's absence from Posture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Discouraged and uneasy , I rang Miss Cluff to see if Mary-Ann had attended the Bell Telephone Hour class . She had not , " I have n't seen hide nor hair of her . But you know how girls are . It 's probably her time . . . . " Belllikelaughter from Miss Cluff . Next I rang the girls ' dormitory . The matron told me that Mary-Ann had not re/turned the previous evening , and she had already made a report to Buck . I confess I was terrified . Had Rusty told her what had happened ? I could not believe it . Masculine pride ( na matter how damaged ) would have prevented him . But he still could have told her something which had made her leave the school . . . and me . I had a sudden vision of them together in Mexico , growing marijuana , utterly happy . The thought was too depressing . Also , I remindedmyself , impractical since he is on parole and may not leave L.A. , much less cross the border . Matters were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office to see him at five . I found him looking altogether too pleased with himself . With him was a typicalCalifornia type : a bronzed empty face with clear eyes and that vapid smile which the Pacific Ocean somehowmanages to impress upon the lips of almost everyone doomed to live in any proximity to those tedious waters . It is fascinating to observe how , in a single generation , stern New England Protestants and keen New York Jews are all entirely Tahitianized by that dead ocean with its sweet miasmic climate in which thoughts become dreams while perceptions blur and distinctions are so erased that men are women are rnen are nothing are everything are one . Gentlemen , the desire and the pursuitof the whole ends at Santa Monica ! The typical specimen was Charlie Flagler Junior , lawyer . He gave me the whitest of smiles , the firmest of handshakes and then , at Buck 's insistence , he let me have it . " Mrs. Breckinridge , as you know , in representing myp188client , Mr. Loner , or any client , I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to  --  like make it crystal clear what their position is . " Buck clapped his hands together , as if in applause . Then he said , " I think , Myra , you should know that Charlie 's dad and me have been pals for lo ! these many years , ever since he handled me when I had that big row with the Blue Network . " " I guess we value Mr. Loner 's account more than almostany single noncorporate account , not only for old times ' sake  --  like Dad says  --  but because Buck Loner has a reputation in this town "  --  Charlie Flagler Junior 's voice became very grave and solemn  --  " for being like a straight-shooter . " " For Christ 's sake , " I said , no doubt in the same tone that Dr. Margaret Mead must have used in trying to extracta straight bit of folklore from her Polynesians , " stop gassing and tell me what lousy trick you 're up to now . " Buck 's face half shut ; he looked pained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I imagined him stretched out before me the way Rusty had been ; a satisfying visionexcept , curiously enough , so complete was last night 's experience that any repetition of it would be redundant , even in fantasy . I have accomplished what natureintended me to do and except for one last turn to the screw , I am complete . " No lousy trick , Mrs. Breckinridge . " The young lawyerwanted to appear grieved but the Polynesian face has only two expressions : joy and incomprehension . He looked quite stupid . " I simply must respect my client'sp189wishes and defend his interests which in this case are your claim to like half the value of this Westwood property , due you as the alleged widow of his nephew . " " Alleged ? " I was ready for battle . Joy filled the brown Pacific face , as though a toasted breadfruit had been offered him after a long swim with Dorothy Lamour . " Alleged . The marriage certificate you gave us is an out-and-out forgery . " I was not as prepared to answer this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now becoming most tricky and dangerous . One false move and all will come to a dead halt , like the ominously stationary ten-times-life-size chorine outside my window . " Mr. Charlie Flagler Junior and you , Buck Loner , brother of Gertrude and cheerful thief , I am the heiress to half this property , and I am goingto get it . So do n't think for one moment you can hold out on me . " " Honey , we 're not trying to keep what 's yours from you . " Buck was plaintive . " That 's the last thing on our minds but we 've got to make sure you really are entitled to it . I mean you could be some kind of impersonator , saying you are who you are . " " Gertrude gave you two hundred dollars back in Philadelphiawhen you were twenty years old to pay for the abortion of the daughter of the Rexall druggist you knocked up and refused to marry . " Buck turned white . The Polynesian remained brown . Buck cleared his throat , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy well . Obviously you did ... " " The point is like this , " said Charlie Flagler Junior , " you have to prove you were married . That 's all . "  | " I shall prove it . " I rose to go . The men rose , too , with a new respect . At least they do n't underestimate their adversary . " Proof will arrive before the end of the week . Meanwhile , Uncle Buck , I shall list all the loans Gertrude made you over the years , and I shall expect repayment , with interest . " I slammed the door as I left . I have just talked to Dr. Montag in New York . He dithered . I was firm . " Randolph , you owe this to me . You owe this to Myron . I do n't want to blackmail you emotionally but you also owe it to the insights we exchanged , the three of us , at the Blue Owl Grill . We made you just as you made us . Now we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " His nervous wheezing often keeps him from hearing what others say . " Crunch ' is a word currently favored by the keener journalists . It means the showdown , the moment of truth . Well , this is the crunch , and I am appealing to you , not only as Myron 's analyst and my dentist but as our only friend . Fly out here tomorrow . " " But , Myra , I ca n't . Your appeal reaches me at every level , there 's no doubt about that . I am touched in every department from lower id , as your husband used to say , to upper superego , but there is the problem of my otherpatients . They need me .... " " Randolph . " I was peremptory . " I 'll cut you in for ten per cent of the take . " There was an alarming series of wheezes and coughs at the other end of the line . Then Dr. Montag said what sounded like " Between , Myra . " " Between what ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan . " Fifteen per cent and I 'm in L.A. tomorrow . " " Answered like a true Adlerian ! Fifteen it is ! " I knew my man . Many was the night that the three of us used to sit until the Blue Owl closed discussing Randolph 's inordinategreed for pastry and money . It was  --  is  --  the most likable thing about him . With that taken care of , I can nowp92Life continues to support Myra Breckinridge in all her schemes to obtain uniqueness . As I write this , Mary-Ann is asleep in my bed ( I have fixed up the daybed in here for myself ) . It is three in the morning . We have talked and wept together for five hours . I have never known such delight . Last night with Rusty was religious ecstasy ; tonighta rebirth . While I was writing in this notebook , there was a rap at the door . I opened it . Mary-Ann stood in the doorway , pale and bedraggled and carrying a Pan Am overnightzipper bag . " Miss Myra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only person I can . " With that she burst into tears and I took her in my arms , reveling in the full rounded warmth of that body , so reminiscent of the early Lana Turner . In a curious way , though she is so much younger and more vulnerable than I , she suggests a mother figure to me , which is madness since in our relationshipI am , necessarily , the one who is wise , the onep193who comforts and directs . I daresay my hatred of my own mother must have had some positive element in it since I am now able to feel genuine warmth for another woman , and a mere girl at that . I must discuss the matter thoroughly with Randolph . Soon the sobbing ceased , and I poured her a glass of gin which she drank neat . This seemed to steady her . " Rusty 's gone again . " She sat on the daybed , and blew her nose . Her legs are every bit as beautiful as Eleanor Powell 's in the last reel of Rosalie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was about to say that any boy on parole is not apt to take a long trip , but I thought better of it . " I do n't know . It happened last night . " She dried her eyes . " Yes ? " I was cautious . " You were with him last night ? " She nodded . " We were supposed to have dinner but hesaid you wanted to see him at ten .... " " A routine chat . " I was casual . " I 'm sorry I picked such an odd hour and ruined your dinner but I was busy with Miss Cluff and . . . " She was , happily , not interested in his visit to me . ' " Anyway he did n't pick me up till after eleven , and I 've never seen him in such a bad mood ... " " Strange , " I added to the official record , " he seemed ' quite cheerful when he left me . In fact , he thanked me profusely for the help I 'd given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . You always are  --  now . Anyway he did n't mention you . He just picked a fight with me , over nothing , and I got angry and then hep194said maybe I 'd better go back to the dorm and not spend the night with him . He said he was . . . " she paused , tears beginning , " sick of me , sick of women , and wanted just to go off by himself . . . . " " Sick of you or of women in general ? " This was a key point . " I do n't know exactly what he said , I was so upset . Both , I guess . " Apparently I had done my work better than I expected . " On top of that , he said he was feeling lousy and he 'd pulled a muscle or something and it hurt him to sit down ... oh , I do n't know , he was just awful . But then I told him about the date I 'd made for him , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You wo n't be mad at me ? " She looked so frightened , young , vulnerable that I wanted to hold her in my arms . " Of course not , dear . " I was Janet Gaynor . " I could never be angry with you . " " You are a friend . " She gave me a dim watery smile . " Well , I had got us both invited to Letitia Van Allen 's home at Malibu , in the Colony . " I sat up straight . I have never been invited to Letitia 's house but then of course I have yet to be of any use to her as a purveyor of studs . Now poor Mary-Ann had fallen unwittingly into Letitia 's trap . " Just how did this invitation come about ? " " Well , I was in her office and we were talking about this date she 'd made for me with that record company and then , I do n't know , the conversation got around top195Rusty and she asked to see a picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry and she said he was very handsome and had star quality and I asked her if she wanted to meet him . . . oh , I know you did n't want him to talk to her until June . . . " " It would have been better after his closed-circuit TV performance . Anyway the damage is done . So you took him to Malibu last night . " She nodded bleakly . " There were a dozen people there , all so successful and rich . One was a star . You know , the one who 's in that television series that was just canceled by CBS , Riptide ? He was nice but drunk . AnywayLetitia made a big fuss over Rusty , who was rude as could be to her and to everybody else . I 've never seen him act like that before . " " Perhaps he had something on his mind . " " Well , whatever it is it was eating him up , for suddenly he gets up and says to Miss Van Allen . I got to cut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , without me . I was never so embarrassed and hurt . Anyway Miss Van Allen could n't have been nicer and said she would n't hold it against Rusty and since it was so late I 'd better sleep over , which I did , though I did n't sleep much , with that boy from Riptide banging on the door all night . " I poured her more gin which she drank . Her spirits improved . " Anyway , today I called Rusty at the ' place where he 's staying and they said he did n't come home last night , and then I called the Academy and they said he did n't go to any of his classes , and then I got scared that maybe he was killed or something so I called the po/lice but they did n't know anything . Then I waited in the dorm all evening for him to call and when finally he did n't , I came here . . . . " Her voice had become quaveryagain . " You did the right thing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here with me until everything 's straightened itself out . " " You 're so good , Miss Myra ! " " Not at all . Now do n't worry about Rusty . Nothing 's happened to him . He 's probably in a bad mood because of the situation he 's in . " Then I told her in detail about Rusty 's Mexican adventures . " So you see he 's on parole and that means the probation officer must always know where he is . So if Rusty ever really did disappear , Uncle Buck and I would be the first to know about it . " Mary-Ann frowned , still absorbing what I had told her . I gave her more gin which she drank as though it was her favorite drink , Seven-Up . " He promised me he was never going to see any of those boys he used to hang out with . " " Well , he 's young . Let him have his fun . As long as he stays out of jail , of course . " She shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I told him . " " And of course it will be you . " I was soothing as I began to spread and arrange my net . " Do n't worry . Now lie down and rest while we chat . " She gave me a grateful smile and stretched out on the daybed . It was all I could do not to sit beside her and caress those extraordinary breasts , made doubly attrac/tive for me since they are Rusty 's to do with as he likes , or so he believes . Having raped his manhood , I shall now seduce his girl . Beyond that , ambition stops and godhood begins . We talked of everything . She is totally in love with Rusty , though shaken by what has happened as well as by my revelation of his Mexican capers . She has had only three lovers in her life , all male . Lesbianism is repulsive to her . But she did agree , after the fourth glass of gin , that she felt entirely secure and warm with me , and that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great reassurance and affection . Finally , slightly drunk , I took her into the bedroom and helped her to undress . The breasts are better than Lana Turner 's in They Wo n't Forget . Smooth and white with large rosy nipples ( in a curious way they are an exaggeratedversion of Rusty 's own ) , their shape is marvelouslysubtle . . . at least what I could see of them , for she promptly pulled on her nightdress and only then removedher panties , hiding from me that center of Rusty 's sexual being in which he has so many times ( but never again if I can help it ! ) spent himself . The thought that soon I shall know intimately the body he knew so made me tremble that I did not dare embrace her good night but instead blew her a kiss from the door , shut it , and promptly rang Mr. Martinson , who was angry at being waked up . But he did tell me that Rusty had decided to leave the Academy and take a permanentjob with a firm that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked where Rusty was stay/ing , Mr. Martinson told me that it was none of my business . Needless to say , I told him where and how to head in , and hung up . Now I must find some way of breaking the news to Mary-Ann . This will be tricky because under no circumstancesmust they be allowed to resume their love affair . That is at an end . A miraculous omen ! I just looked out the window at the enormous woman and she is again turning gaily upon her axis , beautiful and omnipotent , the very image of deity !  |p199Dr  . Montag is sitting on the daybed reading my descriptionof the conquest of Rusty . I sit at the card table , writing these lines , waiting for his comment . Tomorrow we meet Buck and his lawyers . The showdown . Randolph is wheezing through clouds of pipe smoke . He is frowning . I suppose he disapproves . Yet of all peoplehe should understand what it is that I have done . He looks simply God-awful . He thinks he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hangs outside his shiny black rabbinical trousers andp200Randolph has returned to his motel for a nap ; he is still not used to the change in time and wants to be at his best for tomorrow 's meeting . We have prepared two lines of attack ; at the worst , one will succeed . The description of my life 's triumph did not entirely please him which , naturally , does not please me , and that is what matters . " Am I to understand all this really happened ? " Ashes fell upon the page which I snatched from his hand . Randolph'spipe often produces cinders as well as smoke , for he has a tendency to blow through the stem when ill at ease . " Exactly , " I said . " At least you 'll have to agree that I 've got him down in black and white , once and for all , every detail , every hair , every pimple . " " You 've got his outside , yes . " Judiciously he arrangedp201a screen of smoke between us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't shown his inside . " " I have n't shown his inside , dear Randolph , because I do n't know it . And , if I may say so , it is presumptuous for anyone to even pretend he can know what another person 's interior is really like , short of an autopsy . The only thing we can ever know for certain is skin , and I now know his better than he does himself . " " Possibly . Possibly . " Randolph still appeared distressed . " In fact , " I improvised , " nothing matters except what is visible to the eye . For me to write , as I shall when you go , that you looked distressed at this moment could very easily be a projection on my part , and misreading of your mood . To be accurate , I should simply write that while you were reading my notes there was a double crease betweenyour brows , which is not usual , since . . . " " It is not a projection to say that I am distressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less , assume that we know what others are feeling , at least at the more accessible levels of consciousness . At this moment , I am feeling a certain distress for that young man , a certain male empathy . After all , it is a most unpleasant thing to be assaultedanally and I think we can both assume that he was not happy , no matter how mute the skin . " " I agree and that 's why in my review of what happened , I not only recorded his conversation but tried to give what I believed were his feelings when he spoke . Yet I realize that at best my interpretation is entirely subjective , and perhaps false . Since I wanted to frighten andp202humiliate him , I chose to regard his groans and grunts as symptoms of fright and humiliation . " " Which , no doubt , they were . Although we must never rule out the possibility that he was enjoying him-self . " " If that is true , my life 's work has failed . " I was very grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in ways you do not yet understand . In any case , his girlfriend is living with you , is n't she ? " " Yes , she came to me . Of all the people she knows , I am the one she turned to . The irony is perfect . " So is my delight ! " Does she know what you 've done ? " " Of course not . " " What will happen if she finds out ? " " I have no intention of telling her . As for Rusty , I do n't think either of us needs a degree in psychiatry " ( Randolph looked momentarily unhappy ; he has only an M.A. in psychology ) " to know that he will never tell anyone what was done to him . " " Perhaps not . " Randolph 's pipe went off again . One bright cinder burned a hole in the carpet . " But are n't you afraid he may want compensation for what you did , particularly if he is as healthy and normal ' as you think ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take physical revenge on you . Do to you what you did to him . " " Rape ? Not very likely . He 's much too terrified . No , I 've heard the last of him , except in connection with Mary-Ann . . . " Randolph listened carefully as I told him how Ip203planned , with every appearance of love and affection , to possess Mary-Ann in order that the cycle be completed . " What cycle ? " " The justification of Myron 's life . " I was prompt . I have intellectualized everything , as I always do , to the despair of Randolph , who is , despite all his modish pretensionsand quibbling subterfuges , entirely emotional , in many ways a dead ringer for Jean Hersholt . " By acting out what was done to him , I exalt him  --  the idea of him , anyway  --  and also avenge him . . . " " Avenge him ? In what way ? The Myron I knew was hardly a victim . Rather the contrary . " " No , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he really was ... " " A marvelous man . . . " " How you enjoy throwing that in my face ! " I was stung and deeply hurt , as I always am , by reminders that Randolph worshipped Myron and can not , at heart , bear me . " Now , now you must not project . When I praise Myron , I praise him . I do n't denigrate you . " " You are the one projecting now . But , in any case , once I have completed my seduction , I shall be free of all guilt toward Myron and for Myron . I shall be a new woman , literally new , something unique under the sun . " " But who and what will you be ? " I answered vehemently , at length , but said nothing , for , as usual , Randolph , in his blundering way , has touched upon the dilemma 's horn : I have no clear idea as to my ultimate identity once every fantasy has been acted out with living flesh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of obsession and , in this at least , be like no one else who ever lived . Randolph then departed for his nap to be followed by a trip to Disneyland . So here I sit , making these notes . Suddenly ill at ease . Why ? The telephone ringsp205That was Letitia . She came straight to the point . " Rusty 's living with me . He 's down at the beach house right now . " " Letitia ! " That was the best I could do . Not even in my wildest dreams had I ever connected the two of them , particularly after Mary-Ann 's description of Rusty 's rudeness to Letitia on the famous night . " All I can say , Myra , is you sure know how to pick ' em . That is the best Grade A stud I have ever had and as , rumor hath doubtless had it here at the heart of the Industry , Letitia Van Allen has made many a trip to the old corral . " I could think of nothing but Rusty 's soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very best stud of all ? " " The very best , and I 've you to thank for it . When I saw how you had conned that girlfriend of his intop206bringing him to my house , I said to myself : Myra Breckinridgeis a pal ! " 1 was startled but delighted at being given full credit for maneuvering Rusty into Letitia 's orbit . " Of course I knew you 'd enjoy meeting him . " I was neutral , not wanting to betray the fact that it was Mary-Ann I had wanted Letitia to help , not Rusty . " He 's everything I like ! " Letitia roared into the telephone . " In fact , the moment I clapped eyes on him , I said , God , Letitia , but that 's it ! ' " " But Mary-Ann told me he behaved abominably at your house . " " Natch ! That 's what I like . He was sullen , sneering , raging inside . . . " " I 'm sure he was . " I purred with secret satisfaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody and stormed out of the house that I 'd soon be seeing him again . And I did . The next day he came to the office and apologized , still sullen , of course , but wanting to make up . . . said he 'd had a fight with the girl , as if I did n't know , and could I get him work . So I said you bet I can , and signed him to a five-year representational talent contract . Then I rang up Maddox Motors and got him a job as a mechanic . He was grateful , and showed it , right then and there , on the old four-poster . That chenille bedspreadwill never be the same again . " " And it was really marvelous ? " I was genuinely curious to see how Rusty would perform after my disciplinarysession . " I thought , Myra , " Letitia 's words were measured and awed , " that he would kill me . I have never known any/one so masterful . He threw me on the bed and struck me repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that route but did this time . I 'm still black and blue and totally happy , all thanks to you ! " " You exaggerate . " Rusty 's compensation with Letitia for what he had suffered at my hands will fascinate Randolph . " But did he . . . well , say anything about leavingschool , about me ? " " Not a word , except that he was sick of being treated like a kid and wanted to get to work . He wo n't talk about you at all . Did you ever lay him ? " " Not in any classic way , no . But what does he say about Mary-Ann ? " " That 's why I 'm calling you . He feels guilty . I can tell . Now , let 's put our cards on the table . I want him all to myself as long as possible which wo n't be very long , since once he starts making a living he 'll be off with the cute young chicks , leaving poor old Letitia to her Scotch and casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for dear life . So what do we do to keep Miss Pieface out of our lives ? " I told her exactly how it could be done . . . and will be done tonight ! Thanking me profusely , and vowing eternal friendship , Letitia hung up.  |p208Three  in the morning again . Joy and despair , equally mixed , as I watch , hypnotized , the turning statue , and think for the first time how lonely she must be out there , ten times life-size , worshipped but not loved , like me . As soon as Mary-Ann returned from school , I suggested that we drive down to the beach in my rented Chrysler and watch the sunset . She seemed to like the idea . Though she was plainly fretting over Rusty , she did not mention him once , as we drove along the Pacific Highway , bumper to bumper with the rush-hour crowd as it crawled slowly between the dull sea and the brown crumbly hills of fine shifting dust , forever dropping houses into the sea . This coastal region is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon , and so are lunatic . To amuse Mary-Ann , I acted out the entire plot of Marriage Is a Private Affair . She was very much amused , particularly when I quoted Parker Tyler to her . Wep209both agreed that his explication of that paradigmatic wartime film is altogether wonderful . Just as the red-smog was vanishing into the olive-drab sea , I turned casually into the private road of the Malibu Beach Colony , a number of opulent beach houses jammed together between road and sea ; many are occupied by stars of the first and current ( if that is not a contradiction ! ) magnitude . " But this is where Miss Van Allen lives ! " Until then , Mary-Ann had been indifferent to her surroundings , doubtless conducting some inner dialogue with Rusty even as I spoke of James Craig and the great days . " Really ? Where ? " In fact , I did not know which was Letitia 's house , Mary-Ann indicated a gray clapboard Provincetown-style house . " Then why do n't we drop in and say hello ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after last time . Not after the way Rusty talked to her . I 'd be too uncomfortable . " " Nonsense . " I parked in front of the darkened house . The light from the sea was now very faint . " I 'm sure she 's forgiven him . She 's used to artistic temperament . After all , that 's her business . " " But he was so awful , and I looked so silly . " " Do n't be a goose ! " I took her hand and led her to the door and rang the bell . " Besides , this will be good for your career . " To this argument , the only response was acquiescence . From inside the house I could hear a Benny Goodman record ( Letitia belongs in fact to the generation to which I belong in spirit ) . No one , however , answered the doorbell.  | " She 's out . " Mary-Ann was relieved . " Let 's go . " " But I hear music . Come on . " I opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large darkened room that looked onto the sea . Silhouetted against the last light of the day , two figures were dancing , intertwined . According to plan , I switched on the light . Rusty and Letitia leapt apart ; they wore bathing suits ( marvelously reminiscent of Garfield and Crawford in Humoresque ) . " What the hell ! ' exclaimed Letitia , simulating anger . " Darling , I could n't be sorrier ! " I simulated alarm . Both Rusty and Mary-Ann were genuinely shocked ; but where she was hurt , he was truculent . It was Mary-Ann who made the first move . " Where , " she asked him in a quavering voice , " have you been ? " But Letitia did not allow him to answer . " Come on , children , let 's all have a nice drink ! " She crossed to the sanctuary of the bar at the end of the room opposite the plate-glass window , black now from the light within . Rusty simply stared at Mary-Ann . Not once did he look at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can sit down and discuss this like adults . " ( Greer and Joan in When Ladies Meet ) . " Who wants what ? " But no one answered her . Then Mary-Ann repeated , " Where have you been all this time ? " To which Rusty responded in a clear hard voice , " What are you doing with her ? " And he gave me a look of perfect hate . " Myra 's my friend . " Mary-Ann 's voice was faint.  |p211Letitia  gargled some Scotch and then said hoarsely , " Rusty 's been staying here while I get him launched over at Fox with this new series . You sure you do n't want a drink , honey ? Or you , Myra ? " " Are you living with this woman ? " Mary-Ann was still unable to comprehend the situation . " Now , dear , do n't get upset . " Letitia was soothing . " Rusty and I do have a great deal in common but neither one of us would want to hurt you for the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gulped , eyes still on Mary-Ann . " In fact , he was all for telling you this morning but I thought we should wait . Anyway now that the cat 's out of the bag ... " " It 's all my fault , Letitia . " I was humble . " The whole thing . " " No , dear . Do n't blame yourself . It 's probably for the best . Personally I like everything in the open . That 's the way I am . And that 's why I 'm here to tell all the world that I 'm proud to be in love with Rusty , and proud that he loves me ! " With a wail , Mary-Ann fled back to the car . When Rusty started to follow her , Letitia 's arm darted out and held him back . " She 'll be all right . She 's got Myra . " That stopped the young man . He made no further move to follow the girl . Then Letitia crossed to me . She was thrilling , every inch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Ann Dvorak . She took my hands in hers and kissed my cheek . " Be kind to the girl . " " I will , Letitia . You know I will . " " When she 's older , she 'll understand how these thingsp212just happen and that we are all of us simply putty in the hands of the great potter . " The metaphor was mixed , but the delivery was bravura . " Rusty and I need each other . That 's all there is . A man , a woman . . . What else ? It 's Kismet . " She let go my hands . " Good night , Myra . " I said good night and followed Mary-Ann into the darkness . She was in the car , weeping . I comforted her as best I could which was hardly at all since I am a nervous driver and need both hands on the wheel when driving through traffic , particularly along Sunset Boulevard at night . Back at the apartment , Mary-Ann recovered sufficiently to finish the bottle of gin . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She can not understand why Rusty has deserted her or what he sees in Letitia . This was of course my cue to point out that for an ambitious young man like Rusty to be taken up by Letitia is a sure way to stardom . " But he swore he 'd never do anything like that . He 's just not that kind of a boy . . . " . " Apparently he is . I mean , let 's face it , he is living with her . " Since this brought on more tears , as I intended , I took her in my arms . She wept into my neck . Never in my life have I felt so entirely warm and contented . " Forget him , " I whispered into a soft pink ear that smelled of Lux toilet soap . Suddenly she sat up and dried her eyes . " I could murderhim ! " Her voice had gone cello with rage . " Now , now you must n't be angry with the boy . " I was supremely anodyne . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't change people . Just think how lucky you arep213to have learned all this now instead of after you were married , and had children . " " I 'll never marry ! I hate men . " She got shakily to her feet ( she was quite drunk ) , and made her way to the bedroom . When I helped her to undress ( for once she really needed help ) , she was grateful for my attentions which I managed to make discreet , despite the turmoil caused in me whenever those marvelous breasts are unveiled . Then she threw herself onto the bed , and as I pulled off her stockings she pointed her feet like a ballerina . But before I could remove her panties , she pulled the sheet over herselfand said , " I 'm so tired . The room 's spinning around . . . . " Her eyes shut . I turned out the light and got into bed . Shyly , I put out my hand beneath the sheet and touched the nearer breast . She sighed in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chilling . I took the other breast in my hand , and she woke up . " Oh , Myra ! You felt just like Rusty . " But she pushed my hand away . " He 's gentle , too . " " Gentle ? " I recalled what Letitia had said . " I thought he was violent ! " " Whatever gave you that idea ? " She mumbled , still half asleep . " It 's because he was so gentle I loved him . He never grabs you like other boys .... " If nothing else , I have changed at least one young man 's sexual performance , and for the good  --  at least the good of Letitia . From now on Rusty will continue to take out his hatred of me on other women , never realizing to what extent he is really pleasing them . It is ironic what I have inadvertently accomplished . Wanting to tame for allp214time the archetypal male , I have created something ten times as masculine in the classic sense as what I started with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Columbus , I have stumbled on a new world . I caressed Mary-Ann 's breasts , which she allowed ... but only for a moment ; then she turned away from me . " You are an angel , Myra , and I really love you , I do . But I just ca n't . . . you know ... " " Of course I know , dear . " And I do ; yet I am still profoundlyhurt at being rejected . " If only you were a man or there was a man like you , I 'd really fall , I would  --  but not like this , even with you . " This froze me , turned me to stone . But why should I care ? After all , the silkiness of her body , the tautness of the skin , the firmness of the flesh is neither more nor less appetizing to me than Rusty 's body since , in the final analysis ( where I am now marooned ) , a girl is neither more nor less attractive than a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet taking all this into account , there is something about Mary-Ann 's wholeness that excites me . There is a mystery to be plumbed , though whether or not it is in her or in myself or in us both I do not know . I did extract a certain pleasurefrom stroking the body that Rusty had loved , but that victory has already begun to pale . He no longer existsfor me . Only the girl he loved matters . Fortunately , she was compassionate enough to allow me to cradle her in my arms until she fell asleep . Then , when she began softly to snore , obedient to her wishes , I got out of bed and returned to the living room wherep215now I sit at the card table , drinking gin and tonic , writingthese lines , too disturbed for sleep . My head is spinning with fatigue . I must have MaryAnnbut only if she wants me , and that is impossible as things are now . I 've just tried to ring Randolph but he gave instructions to the motel operator that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastard ! He knew that I would need to talk to him tonight . Obviously Disneylandwas too much for him.  |p216Buck  's office . I sit at his desk . Randolph sits in the big chair underneath the portrait of Elvis Presley . Buck and his lawyer have gone into the next room to take a telephone call from New York . As soon as they were out of the room , Randolph wanted to talk but I motioned for him to be quiet . The room is bugged , like everything out here . So Randolph now sits wheezing softly , chewing the stem of his pipe and staring out the window . I write these lines for something to do . We 've shaken them , no doubt of that . But I 'm still not certain whether or not they will call our bluff . Randolph presented them with a signed affidavit , duly notarized , swearing that he had witnessed my wedding to Myron in Monterrey , Mexico . Up until the very last moment I thought I would have trouble with Randolph . Fortunatelyhis greed finally convinced him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , he is nervous as a cat . So am I.Buck was true to form . " It was a real nice gesture of your'n , Doc , to come out here and help out this li ' 1 ol gal . " More than ever was Buck , revoltingly , the Singin ' Shootin ' Cowboy , so inferior in every way to Hoot Gibson . " Naturally we want to do the right thing by her . " " Then cut the cackle , " I said firmly , " and hand over the three hundred fifty G 's which all of our lawyers now agree is my adjusted share of the property . " " Certainly , Mrs. Breckinridge , " said Charlie Flagler Junior . " Just as soon as we get final word , any minute now , from our New York office which will like clear up one final detail , it 's all yours because , " he turned to Randolph , " we are not about to question the probity of such a well-known person and author like Dr. Montag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who looked gloomy as he always does when someone praises him ( his father withheld all praise during Randolph 's formative years and so today he can never accept any compliment without suspecting that it is loaded , as this one of course was ) . " Right here , " said Buck , holding up a check written on the Bank of America , Beverly Hills Branch , " I 've got the check , all made out to you and everything . " Both Randolph and I felt a good deal better at the sight of the loot : three hundred and fifty thousand dollarsis more than enough to finance me for the next few years while I finish Myron 's work and begin my own . Yes , I have decided to make an investigation in depth ofp218the problem of communication in the post-McLuhan world . Each day that I spend in the company of the studentsmakes me more than ever aware that a new world is being born without a single reliable witness except me . I alone have the intuition as well as the profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only what he is but what he must become , once he has ceased to be confined to a single sexual role , to a single person ... once he has become free to blend with others , to exchange personalities with both men and women , to play out the most elaborate of dreams in a world where there will soon be no limits to the human spirit 's play . As I have been goddess , so others can be whatever they want in this vast theatre we call the world where all bodies and all minds will one day be at the disposal of everyone , and no one will read books for that is a solitary activity like going to the bathroom alone ( it is the proliferation of private bathrooms , which has , more than anything else , created modern man 's sense of alienation from others of his kind : our ancestors bathed and shat togetherand , all in all , relished the sharing of their commonnatural functions ) or like making love alone if there are others available to share the body 's pleasures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly as I see this page on which I scribble random notes while waiting for Buck and Charlie Flagler Junior to return from their telephoning in the next office . I have made up my mind to continue teaching here , if Buck will have me . . . which I doubt . Yet I must make the effort to charm him , if it is not too late , for not only am I able to observe and learn from the students but theyp219in turn profit from me . Without the Academy , I would have to invent an equivalent , a place in which to shape the minds of the young , particularly the boys who crave discipline . Yet , oddly enough , since that night of nights in the infirmary all my desires to dominate the male have been  --  if not satisfied  --  in abeyance , a true breakthrough , according to Randolph , though he still believes that I went too far and may have damaged Rusty 's capacityto love women , to which I responded , " That is exactly what I wanted to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why not teach him love ? " There are times when Randolph is singularly dense . " Because only through a traumatic shock , through terrifyingand humiliating him , could I hope to change his view of what is proper masculine behavior . To keep him from breeding , and so adding to the world 's overpopulation , I was forced to violate everything he has been taught to regard as sacred , including the sanctity of his tiny back door .... " Randolph looked suddenly queasy . " Please , Myra , you know how any explicit reference to the anal upsets me . The fault is mine , or weakness I should say , " he added quickly , anticipating one of my sharp rejoinders . " But tell me , is there any evidence that your tormenting of him has had any effect at all , good or bad ? " " He quarreled with Mary-Ann ... " " A passing fit of ill-temper ... " " Not passing . He 's left her for Letitia Van Allen . " Candid as I always am with Randolph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my maneuvering to keep Rusty and Mary-Ann apart . There is evidence that Rusty is stillp220in love with Mary-Ann . Fortunately she will not , in her present mood , have anything to do with him and I am certain that as long as she is with me I can prolong that mood for quite some time . Also , the fact that Mary-Ann is living with the woman who raped him will unconsciouslyidentify her with me in Rusty 's mind ; if nothing else , this connection should help to maintain the current distance between the lovers . " And from what Letitia tells me , his lovemaking has been dramatically improved as a result of what I did to him . " " How would you know ? He never made love to you . " " Mary-Ann has told me that he was always extremely gentle with her . . . she has a childhood trauma and can not bear rough lovemaking and so , in time , will be drawn to women who are gentle . But with Letitia , he is a rampaging bull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to her delight of course . " " Interesting " was all that Randolph had to say on the subject . But I can tell that he is impressed at what I have accomplished even though , being a Jew and a dentist , he can never wholeheartedly accept my new order for the human race since the fluidity which I demand of the sexes is diametrically opposed to Mosaic solidity . Yet I am right , for it is demonstrably true that desire can take as many shapes as there are containers . Yet what one pours into those containers is always the same inchoate human passion , entirely lacking in definition until what holds it shapes it . So let us break the world 's pots , and allow the stuff of desire to flow and intermingle in one great viscous sea ... .  |p221The  door just opened .

Die Amerikanerin had been precipitate . She would need him right away . Early next morning , Sally telephoned Grant to tell him that he was the father of a baby boy . " He leaped into the world , " Sally said breathlessly , " as if he were in a hurry . " Eileen was fine . She would love to see him . " She wants you to meet your son . " Grant left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eileen 's room by a girl in nurse 's uniform . She was dark , almost swarthy , but had a pleasant look about her . Eileenwas propped up in bed . She smiled , reached out her hand . She looked wan . Grant moved to the bedside and took her hand . " This is Schwester , " she said . The nurse bobbed her head , smiled . She had a very nice smile . " Schwester , this is . . . my . . . " Eileen was hung up . Grant reached out his hand to shake Schwester 's . " Husband , " he said , " father . " Eileen spoke to Schwester . " Would you please . . . is it all right , do you think ? Could you bring in our son ? " Schwester nodded . She moved swiftly . She left the room . " Bring up a chair , " said Eileen . " Be comfortable . " Grant did as he was told . " How do you feel ? " " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're worried ! " Eileen 's eyes filled with tears . She brushed them away . " Yes . I am worried . A little bit . But the doctor  --  he 's such a wonderful man . He says it 'll be all right . " " Then why worry ? Take his word for it . " " He came too soon  --  our baby . . . He would n't wait . " Schwester came back , bearing , on a cushion , a tiny swaddled object . Grant looked at its face ; the eyes were screwed up tight , the expressionsomehow truculent , defiant . " Moment , bitte , " Schwester said to Grant . He got up and gave her his chair . Schwester sat , the cushion in her lap , and began feeding the object out of an eye dropper , counting the drops of colorless liquid as she slid them between the sucked-in lips . Schwester got up bearing the cushion aloft . Eileen made some kind of gesture which Schwester un/derstood . She was very deft ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of horror at what he saw . The infant was transparent ; through the membrane of skin  --  like some sort of invisible plastic  --  he could see its viscera . He stared . He beheld , in the minute coils of protoplasm , infinitesimal undulations . He heard Eileen 's voice : " Our baby is n't finished yet . " Eileen 's hand reached out . It touched the cushion . Grant turned his eyes from the baby and looked at her . It was the first time , he realized then , that he had really looked at her since her arrival yesterday . He felt that he had never seen her before at all ; he had never seen this look . Her eyes were fastened on her baby . In them now Grant saw what he had never seen in them before  --  a look of such tenderness and sorrowthat he was himself moved beyond his own understanding . Eileen 's face was a pieta of love and mourning  --  mourning for love beheld , love taken away . She moved her body slightly toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helplessly , to infuse her own lifeblood , her own life essence , into her child , to strengthen the wavering thread , to quicken the faint pulsations . He knelt by Eileen 's side . He took her hands , kissed them . " Do n't worry , darling . He 'll be all right . I know it . " She stroked his hands . " Our baby does n't cry . " " He will live . Ca n't you see it by the expression on his face ? He is determined . " Eileen smiled at Schwester and nodded . Quickly , Schwester reswaddledher charge and bore him out . Eileen 's hand was caressing Grant 's head . He was still on his knees beside the bed . He buried his face in the pillow . He did not look at her for a long time . He felt that he could not bear to see again that look which mourned the swiftly passingvision of love in the tangled world.  |p102The  day after Grant 's baby was born Lowe invited him and Sally to dinner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the father of the first American baby to be born in Salzburg , had become an overnight celebrity in the town . When the headwaiter , an old friend of Lowe 's , as all headwaiters were , received them , he handed Lowe the Salzburg newspaper and pointed to an item in it . Lowe laughed as he read it and handed the paper to Grant . " You see , Stanley , " he said , " you 're famous now in Salzburg too ! " Grant stared at the paper but he did n't see . " It describes the historic event , " Lowe added as they followed the headwaiter to their table . Grant , who was moving around in a kind of catalepsy and who , in addition , could n't read German , kept staring stupidly at the paper through glazed eyes . He gave it back to Lowe . " The headline says : SURPRISED WHILE ON VACATION ! " Sally smiled . Grant said nothing . He had n't known , till this moment , that he was having a vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the table it quickly developed that Lowe and Sally had mutual acquaintances in Ohio . Lowe had been to Cleveland to beat the drum for Stohl 's productions there . After the opening of The Miracle in Cleveland , Lowe 's previous hosts had given a great party . These hosts , it turned out , were family friends of Sally 's father and stepmother . They had attended that party . Sally asked whether Lowe had n't met her fatherand his wife there . Lowe said that he distinctly remembered the second Mrs. Frobisher . She was a theater buff and prattled on a lot about it . Sally smiled faintly . Lowe had learned long since that it was wise not to be prematurely enthusiastic about stepmothers . " I kept hearing about it for weeks , " said Sally . " I got very tired of hearing about it . I thought they were mean not to take me . They said I was too young . But I did see the performance  --  at a matinee . " " Well , you 'll see it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you to supper with the professor  --  at the palace . "  | " That will be very nice , " said Sally . " My parents said Professor Stohl was charming . " Grant kept hearing Stohl referred to as the professor . He wondered why . In America no matter how eminent a theater director became , he remained Mister . The Germans were more formal . " So he is , " said Lowe . " One of the most charming men in the world . He is also the greatest teacher of acting in the world . Have you any ambition to act ? " " None whatever . " " That is unusual . " " It 's just that I have no talent . My school plays revealed that ! " " That is even more unusual  --  I mean , knowing it . " " I saw The Miracle from the gallery , " said Grant . " I made the trip from Xenia . It 's an awful play . " " It 's not a play , " said Lowe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can compare with Stohl in handling crowds . " Grant kept studying Sally . Half man , half playwright , he could n't wait for the moment when she would confront Dr. Ogden . He wondered what she would say if he told her now , ever so casually , that her sometimeantagonist was in Salzburg , that he was staying with Mary Kennicott , presumably ministering to her as he had done to her mother . How would she receive this bombshell ? He remembered Eileen 's letters from Cleveland : the long and lethal battle between Sally and Dr. Ogden , resolvedfinally by the stalwart Mr. Slater . He was athrob to tell her but he did n't . She was a strange girl . She had a secret life which absorbed her , which insulated her from passing events . Here were delights spread before her by Kaetchen ; she contemplated them with detachment . What was she really thinking ? Grant had never known . His mouth wateredat the prospect of the meeting between Dr. Ogden and Sally  --  if only he were lucky enough to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lunch and bringing Dr. Ogden without telling her . Yes , that 's what he would do . He would n't throw away this opportunity by telling her now . He would contrive the meeting ; and then he would watch it . As a dramatist he was lucky : he had his protagonists right there to act out his third act for him ; he had only to observe . The excitement of this prospect drove out his personal worries  --  over Eileen , over his tenuously living son.  |p104Lowe  misunderstood Grant 's self-communion . " What 's wrong with you , Stanley ? I called Dr. Wolff . He says it 's a near thing but that your son will be all right . Cheer up . " Lowe made an effort to explain Grant 's self-absorption to Sally . " For Jews , " he said , " fatherhood is a serious thing . Especially for poor Jews . " Sally smiled at Grant . " Are you poor , Stanley ? " " He was , " said Lowe , " and so , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point the waiter arrived with the great , German-written menus and handed them around . Lowe sank at once into the arcana of the menu . Sally did n't look at hers . Neither did Grant . Sally saw that Grant was unhappy and was concerned for him . " Of course you 're worried , " she said . " But it 'll be all right . It could n't not be ! " Lowe , who had already picked what he wanted , was annoyed to look up and find that his guests had n't even begun their study of what , to him , was one of the most important documents in life . For him , ordering a meal was a solemn ritual . When he invited people to a restaurant for lunch or dinner , he wished his guests would concentrate on the menu until they had decided what they wanted . They never did . They dawdled . They chattered . He found this misapplication of energy frivolous . He could n't stand their preoccupation with irrelevancies when there were important decisions to make . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the weaknesses of human nature , one of the few about which he was intolerant . He was even a bit edgy with Sally . " My dear , you have n't looked at your menu . Are n't you hungry ? " " Famished , " said Sally . Lowe handed her his own menu . " Here , order from this . I 've marked it with my own recommenda-tions . " " What 's tafelfleisch ? " inquired Sally . " Boiled beef . It 's marvelous at Sacher in Vienna . I do n't recommend it here . " " Why do n't we have what you have , Kaetchen ? " said Grant , who was n't hungry at all.  | " Oh let 's ! " said Sally . " I 'm sure that will be splendid ! " Lowe , who had already ordered , was greatly relieved . He held up three fingers before the waiter . " Dreimal , " he said . Grant explained to Sally : " Kaetchen just ca n't stand it when peopledo n't give all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule , " said Lowe . " It holds up the waiters . " " For Kaetchen , " said Grant , " restaurant menus are Holy Writ . You must give them all you have . " Sally smiled at Lowe . " I know exactly how he feels . " Lowe was delighted . " Do you ? " " You are a gourmet , I suppose , and therefore food is your passion . I feel the way you do when I hear people whispering at concerts . " Lowe was vanquished by Sally . He was flattered by the analogy : putting his preoccupation with menus on the same level as her own with music . " You have imagination , my dear , a sensitive imagination . " He picked up her hand and kissed it . " I shall be your friend for life , your devoted friend for life . " " I will like that very much , " said Sally . Grant 's eyes strayed across the room . The headwaiter was ushering in some newcomers . Grant 's heart almost stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Kennicott and Dr. Ogden . He saw the headwaiter leading them to a remote table . He got up and made his way to them . Mary was delighted to see him ; she embraced and congratulatedhim . Dr. Ogden joined in her congratulations . Grant told Mary that he was dining with Lowe and suggested that she join them . Mary rejected the proffered table at once . Lowe arose to greet Mary . " Delighted ! " he said , though he was n't entirely . He did n't like visitorsat restaurant tables . But he motioned to the waiter to draw up two chairs . Dr. Ogden saw Sally . His peerless teeth showed in a smile of pleasure . " Sally ! As I live and breathe ! " He reached out his hand , which Sally seemed not to see.  | " This is a surprise , " she said , with no air at all of being surprised . For a moment Grant thought : " She knew he was here . " The waiter brought menus which he handed to Mary and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things at the hospital . Lowe foresaw another delay . " I beg you , Mary , " he pleaded , " concentrate on the menu ! " Mary laughed . " Oh , excuse me , Kaetchen , I forgot . Why ca n't we just have what you 're having . Then the meal will have an element of surprise ! " " It has already provided that , " said Ogden as he sat beside Sally . He looked at her with unconcealed delight . " I ca n't tell you what a sur-prise ! " Lowe made a sign to the waiter . " Funfmal , " he said wearily . Mary sat beside Grant . " Well , my dear , are n't you thrilled ? We were all thrilled . Stephanie asked me especially to congratulate you before she left . " " Where did she go ? " asked Lowe . " To Bad Gastein . She was feeling rather dowdy and she thought the cure might perk her up a bit . " " Good idea , " said Lowe . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching his two characters . Mary was looking at them too . She was struck by Sally 's youth and freshness . She spoke to Ogden . " So you 've found another friend from Blue Hill ! Is n't it nice ? " " It 's like a class reunion , is n't it , Stanley ? " said Ogden . " Blue Hill , Maine , Class of 1934 ! " " What did you study there ? " asked Lowe . Dr. Ogden was beaming at Sally . " What did we study , Sally ? What did we study ? " " The arts , " said Sally . " You remember , Mary , " said Ogden , " my telling you about my Cleveland patient , Mrs. Frobisher ? " " Of course I do , " said Mary . " Such a sad story . " " This is her daughter . Did I exaggerate ? " " You did not exaggerate . She is perfectly lovely . "  | " Thank you , " said Sally . She was composed , neither pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porcelain , ' I used to call her . I 'm old-fashioned . I read Meredith . Do you remember , Sally ? " " I remember perfectly . " " It used to please you , did n't it ? " " Very much . " " Perfect ! " said Mary , lavishing admiration on Sally . " Dainty rogue in porcelain . ' Is that Meredith ? But it 's absolutely perfect ! " Grant 's play sprang to life . A shaft of new light played on his third act . He could n't help but admire Ogden 's aplomb . He brought back the unhappy shade of Sally 's mother . He flung open the door to that corridorof murky , possibly murderous , history . There came back into his mind the time when he had doubted Eileen 's accounts of what was going on in Cleveland during Mrs. Frobisher 's last illness , when he had thought them figments of Eileen 's and Sally 's morbid imaginations just as some critics think that the apparitions seen by the governess in Henry James 's Turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for her employer in London . And now this suspicionrecurred . Surely , surely Dr. Ogden could not be so candid , so untroubled , so forthright were not the suspicions of Eileen and Sally , who were children after all , chimerical . This new aspect put Grant 's mind in a whirl of dramatic possibility ! Evidently , some kind of flirtation had gone on between Dr. Ogden and Sally . Sally had liked very much having Meredith 's description of another heroine applied to her . Accordingto Eileen 's hysterical letters , Sally had feared and hated Dr. Ogden . And what about the big scene in the unimpeachable Mr. Slater 's office when Dr. Ogden had been convinced that it would be practical for him to yield to Sally her rightful inheritance ? Did Dr. Ogden call her a " dainty rogue in porcelain " in Mr. Slater 's office and had she liked it even there ? One thing he knew , of one thing he felt certain . He had his last act . In his last act , his Kenneth Ogden would woo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to take a lively part in the conversation . The weight that had burdened him was sloughed off , the weight of fatherhood , of marriage , of responsibility . He saw Sally now in a new light , mysterious , lidded , inscrutable.  |p108There  was a stir in the restaurant . Necks craned . Prince StaufferWernecke , the leader of the Austrian Nazi Party , had entered with four storm troopers . They were in full uniform . With hushed deference the prince and his party were escorted to their table . As he passed Lowe 's table , the prince waved to him . Lowe waved back . The hum of conversation in the restaurant subsided . Everyone was staring at the Austrian leader . " Why are these people allowed to swagger around here like this ? " Mary asked . Lowe reminded her that Austria was now a German state , Mary did n't know that . " Where 's all that gemutlichkeit ? " she asked . " That 's Bavarian , " said Lowe . " Where Herr Schicklgruber dispensesit . " Mary was indignant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization , " she said . Dr. Ogden addressed himself to Grant : " I do n't think they 'll get anywhere , do you , Stanley ? " Dr. Ogden was deferential to Grant , treating him as an authority on world affairs . In his heart Grant felt sure Ogden despised him . Ogden amplified : " I mean  --  ultimately ? " " Perhaps not ultimately , but proximately . They 're making many people uncomfortable  --  including me . " " You have n't got a thing to worry about , " said Ogden . He glanced toward the prince and his storm troopers . " This sort of thing could n't happen with us . Not possibly . " There was a moment of strained silence . Grant forebore to tell Ogden that in certain strata of American life , it already had happened . HighplacedAmericans had made themselves unpaid agents of Dr. Goebbels and were transmitting his suggestions for the improvement of American life all over the United States . " It 's all incredible , is n't it ? " said Mary . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean by that ? I 'd say it 's inhuman . " " Ah ! An idealist ! " " You are a very cynical man ! "  | " I do n't think so . I putter around in history . I observe the human race . That 's merely a zoological classification , is n't it ? " Mary sighed . " How lucky we are , all of us , are n't we , that we 're American ? " " For the moment  --  yes , " said Lowe . " What an awful thing to say ! How can you say a thing like that ? " " In any case , " said Lowe , " we here at this table are all delightful people . There is nothing whatever wrong with us . " Mary laughed . She knew that Lowe did n't want to enter into a seriousdiscussion with her , that he would consider it macabre . " Well , whatever you say , Kaetchen , being American gives one a wonderful feeling of safety , does n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who wanted to sweep this conversation under the table , " what an odd thing it is . . . Disraeli and Karl Marx . . . " " What about them ? " said Dr. Ogden . " Here they were in London  --  the two of them  --  for all those years  --  Marx working in the British Museum , Dizzy running around  --  and yet they never met . Would n't it have been interesting  --  is n't it too bad that they never met ? " " That Karl Marx ! " said Mary with distaste . " He 's responsible for everything . So unattractive , is n't he ? Looks like one of those advertisementsfor just after you 've taken something . " Grant made a mental note that someone in his play might say that . But the conversation had a depressing effect on him . Safe . Mary could feel safe . Sally could feel safe . Dr. Ogden could feel safe . But he and Lowe  --  could they feel safe ? And even if they could , was n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of demarcation , an arrangement , a condescension , a tip ? He began to brood again . He wanted to go back to the United States right away . But then he could n't . He had a baby in the hospital , and a bride . He was trapped . The entrance of the prince and his party overcast Lowe 's table . When they had finished eating , they rose to go . Lowe invited them all to the archbishop 's palace . He wanted Sally to see it . Sally said she 'd love to . In the porte cochere , waiting for Mary 's car , Grant , just behindOgden and Sally , saw Ogden lightly touch her hand . He took his hand away quickly and smiled at her . She smiled back.  |p110Grant  's spirits revived . He was even exultant . He was in a wonderful position . He would allow Ogden and Sally to play out his third act for him . Grant went daily to see Eileen and his child at the hospital . Most always , Sally went with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwester brought him in . Grant had told Sally that the baby was transparent and would n't allow Schwester to unwrap him . One day Schwester showed them proudly the chart of the baby 's first week of life . It showed a gain of several ounces of weight  --  from those injectionsfrom the eye dropper  --  and the graph of its evacuations . Grant was astonished ; already the life cycle of this mite had started , already it had a physiological history that could be recorded . Sally would sit with them for fifteen minutes or so and then go , Grant suspected , on inventederrands . She wished , without saying so , to leave Grant and Eileenalone . Leaving him alone with Eileen , Grant reflected , was a techniquewhich Sally had perfected long ago in Blue Hill . One day , when they begged her to stay a few minutes longer , Sally said that she could n't because Dr. Ogden was picking her up in Mary 's car to take her for a drive around the lake . Eileen had been told , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at this announcement , she could scarcely conceal her astonishment . She said nothing and neitherdid Grant , but everything showed in Eileen 's face . Sally kissed her , said she would come tomorrow and left . " Well , " said Grant , " what do you think of that ? " " Whatever Sally does is all right , " said Eileen . " Did she flirt with Ogden back there  --  in Blue Hill ? " " She loathed him . " " It does n't look like it , does it ? I felt it the other night  --  I told you  --  in the restaurant . There is a background there . It was obvious . Hep111used to pay her compliments . And , moreover , she liked it . What 's going on here anyway ? What 's Sally like ? What is she ? " " Whatever Sally does is all right , " Eileen repeated stubbornly . " I sometimes suspected that you and Sally were indulging in hallucination . All those melodramatic letters of yours ! Were they all moon-shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't true . " " Well , on the basis of what you wrote me would you think that Sally would be going on drives with Dr. Ogden ? " " She has a reason . " " What reason ? Do you know or are you just guessing ? " " I do n't know . But I 'm not guessing . " " It seems very odd to me . It does n't make sense to me . " Eileen 's brown eyes became misted over with feeling . " When I think what Sally has done for me  --  the friend she 's been to me . I ca n't tell you . . . " " You 've been a loyal friend to Sally too . You 've seen her through some rough spots . " " I was hired to be her companion , not her friend . She taught me friendship . I was ignorant , you know how ignorant . I knew nothing about anything . She educated me . She . . . " Eileen could n't go on . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He keeps them tightly shut always . " " I know . " " Why does he never open his eyes ? " " He 's concentrating , I think , on keeping his poor little life going . " " He looks determined . I noticed that from the first . I think he 'll keep it going . " " I pray . " " When he does open them , I hope they 'll be beautiful  --  his eyes  --  like yours . " " I want him to look like you  --  another you . " " Oh , do n't wish that on him . Do n't wish acne on him . " Eileen laughed . She peered at him . " Why , it 's gone ! It 's almost gone . Hardly a trace of it left ! " " It comes and goes , " he said grimly.  |p112There  was a silence . " You know , dearest , you do n't have to marry me . You do n't love me . I 'd never have let you know about the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have to marry me . " " If you knew what I am  --  if you knew me really , what I 'm capable of  --  you would n't want to marry me . " Eileen smiled . She touched his face with her palm . She smiled . " Are you terrible ? " Grant resented her light tone on a serious topic . " Are you very terrible ? " " I do n't know myself at all  --  I did n't know at all what I was  --  till I came here . " " Do you want to confess to me ? I used to go to confession and it always made me feel better . " " I have n't the courage . " " Shall I tell you the truth ? I 'm not curious . I do n't in the least want to know . " " I 'm contemptible . " Eileen dropped her light tone . She was almost sharp . " Do n't say that ! I wo n't let you say that ! " There was a knock on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see her . He had grown to like Schwester . She was unobtrusive , silently efficient , quick , responsive , reassuring . Schwester announced tactfully that Der Herr Primarius was even now making his rounds and that perhaps it would be better . . . Grant rose to go . He bent over Eileen and kissed her . " I 'll be in tomorrow . " " I 'll be in too , " said Eileen , pleased with her little joke . " Tonight I 'm going to Mary 's housewarming party  --  big doings , supper on a barge on the lake  --  so I 'll have lots of gossip for you . " " It sounds wonderful . Do n't worry about anything . Have a good time . Have a wonderful time . " " Can I bring you anything ? Is there anything you want ? " " Nothing . Just come . " He turned to go . " And Stanley ... " " Yes , darling ? " " Do n't look down on yourself . "  |p113Grant  came to Mary 's party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black frock , was a tall-stemmed flower walking , but Grant was conscious of how dowdy he and Lowe looked . Up to this moment he had been rather complacent about his expensive , custom-made dinner jacket , but the elegance of the tall , slender young Englishmen and Austrians who were there cowed him . They wore dress costume the like of which Grant had never seen : mess jackets in pastel colors with little rows of gold buttons and beautifully knotted ties in rose , lavender and pale blue . He had never seen such exquisite and assured young men . It was a roomful of Ians ! Even Dr. Ogden , who at once joined them , seemed burly and ungainly beside them . They stood about in little clumps ; a modulated twittering arose from them ; Grant felt that he , a mottled crow , had blundered into an aviary reserved for birds of paradise . At the grand piano , an excessively handsome young man was playing and singing from the piano score of Der Rosenkavalier . Lowe whispered to Grant and Sally . " Tetty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley . I hear he 's doing the sets for your play in London . He started out to be a concert pianist . " Mary came up to them . She kissed Sally , for whom she had conceived a great liking , and started walking them toward the piano . " I want you to meet Tetty . I 'm mad for him . " They joined the group around Tetty . He was singing softly , in a true and clear voice , with exact intonation . He sang both Octavian and the Marschallin in the first act . For the Marschallin he employed a falsetto , very appealing . He ( she ) was reassuring Octavian : " Du bist mein Schatz . . . " Tetty felt deeply what he was singing . It was very tender , very moving . Grant succumbed to the spell in which the others were held . He knew the opera . He had read the libretto by von Hofmannsthal , and been ravished by its elegant , lyric , rueful sophistication . A hand took his and squeezed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They stood together , yielding to the magic . It was a kind of mesmerism ; one could have wished it to go on forever . He moved closer to Varina ; why was n't he in love with Varina , he loved her so ? He looked for Sally . But she was standing with Dr. Ogden.  |p114After  the duet Tetty stopped and started to get up . But there were cries of protest . " The mirror scene ! You must do the mirror scene ! " Tetty complied on the instant . " If you had n't asked me I should have been furious ! " he said . Everybody laughed . He riffled the pages of the score to the mirror scene : the Marschallin sings , " Die Zeit das ist ein sonderbares Ding . . . " Looking at herself in the mirror , the Marschallin visualizes the moment when she will go down the street and people will say : " There she goes  --  the elderly Marschallin . " It was very affecting and no one was more affected than Tetty ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . He wondered , why should the passing of time mean so much to this young man ? He had so much of it left . When he finished the mirror scene Tetty got up . Mary introduced him to Grant . Sally , Varina , Lowe and a cluster of the Olympian youths were gathered round . " Oh ! Mr. Grant ! I 've been longing to meet you . " Grant mumbled about how moved he had been by his rendition . " It 's my stunt , you know ! But I 'm wildly excited  --  did you know ? I 'm to do the sets and dresses for your play in London . I simply adore your play . It will be such fun for me . I 've got my sketches . Would you like to see them ? " " I 'd love to . I feel very lucky . " " It 's too exciting , " said Mary . Grant felt his usual astonishment at being made such a fuss over simply because he had written a successful light comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky he was . " Do n't be silly ! " said Tetty . " I demanded the job . I 'm very stubbornwhen I 've set my heart on something . " He turned to Mary . " But you know that , darling ? How perfectly ruthless I am when I want something ? " " I wish you 'd demand something of me , " said Mary wistfully . " I will . Do n't you worry . I will . You do n't know the darker side of my nature . But you 'll find out . You 'll be so disillusioned ! " " I ca n't wait , darling . Bring on the darker side . " Tetty laughed . " On a salver ! " " Exactly ! On a salver. "  |p115Mary  kissed him . Tetty waved to someone across the room and started to go . He paused for a second . " You may tell my darling Stephanie and Ian too that I 'll never forgivethem  --  never  --  for not being here . Imagine ! Preferring that dreary Gastein to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely dire . " " I 'm pretty bitter about it myself , " said Mary . Tetty walked away , the graceful young men following him . He moved through the room like a crown prince at his own court . At the mention of Stephanie , Grant felt livid himself . He could n't have borne it if she were there . He could n't have faced her . It was bad enough without her being there . Dr. Ogden came up to Mary . " She 's arrived , " he said . " You 'd better ... " " Oh , my God ! " said Mary , looking across the room . " She 's here ! " She darted off , Ogden following . " Who is she ' ? " asked Varina . " The Grand Duchess Marie . " They all looked . A portly middle-aged woman entered . Mary had reached the door just as the grand duchess came in . Mary floated down in a deep curtsy . " I did n't know , " said Varina in her drawling voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished ! " " It 's a very deep curtsy for a saleslady at Bergdorf Goodman 's , " observedLowe . He explained to Grant : " That 's where she works , you know . " Grant nodded . " I 've seen it in the papers . " " Well , I think she deserves a very deep curtsy for being so democratic , " said Sally . Lowe let fall a little advance information . " Mary and I went over the seating arrangement for the barge . Stanley , you 'll have the grand duchess on your right and Varina on your left . What more can you want ? " " I do n't want any more , " said Varina . " I 'm going to get chummy with the grand duchess . It would please my parents and I do so little to please them . Pilot me , Kaetchen . " Lowe complied . Grant was left alone with Sally . He had been conscious of a feeling of pleasure that Sally had been there when Tettyp116made such a fuss over him . Evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must say , Stanley , you are in demand , are n't you ? Internationalfigure ! What a pity Eileen could n't be here to see it . She 'd be so proud of you . But then , she is anyway . Let 's stroll about , shall we ? " Grant looked at her . Was Sally a fiend ? But her expression was candid . She was sincere , delighted for Eileen , and for him too . Grant 's littletriumph turned to ashes . Dr. Ogden came up to them . " My dear Stanley , " he said , " I know these lovely girls want nothing in life but to be with you . But still ! I claim the priority of age . I 've been wanting to talk to you ever since the other night at the restaurant . " He appealed , with an air of helplessness , to Sally . " Wo n't you intercede for me , Sally ? Wo n't you get me an audience with Stanley ? " " I ca n't undertake it , " said Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I know . But I do n't believe Stanley is the kind of celebrity who forgetsold friends . " " Well , " said Sally , " queue up ! " Not till this moment had Grant known that he and Dr. Ogden were old friends . Still it would be useful to him to have a confidential chat with Ogden . He could n't find out too much about him and Sally . " I 'd love to see you any time " he said . Dr. Ogden showed his perfect teeth in a triumphant smile as he turned to Sally . " There ! You see ! I 've bullied him into a date . Lunch or dinner ? " " Either one , " said Grant . " Done and done ! Lunch Wednesday at the Mirabelle . " " Fine , " said Grant . Grant wanted to get outside . As he moved through the phosphorescent groups , he felt disembodied , a spar floating off from a wrecked ship . When he reached the hall he almost ran , down the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawn . He walked to the pier . There was the huge barge lit by tall flambeaux . It was a balmy , starlit night . The flame from the torches wavered in the still water ; the orchestrafrom Vienna , installed in an improvised pavilion on the lawn , was playing waltzes , softly . At the pier a little flotilla of dinghies andp117motor launches was gathered to take Mary 's guests to their dinners . It was a scene out of a fairy tale . What ingenuity these people expended on their diversions ! Grant could not dispel a puritanic revulsion . What on earth was he doing here with grand duchesses and barges ? Grant leaned against a pier post . Scanning the dark outline of the forest horizon against the sailing clouds , he saw another light , a light fixedly burning , the light on top of the aerie . It made the light from the flambeaux on the barge seem clownish , like the glare from a carnivalset up for one night . The light up there was fixed for an eternity of nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there and his acolytes were there . They were planning . He thought of the mite in Diakonissen Haus , marked already for the incinerating beam from the burning glass . Its eyes were always screwed up tight . What if it had opened its eyes , seen the world , despaired of it , and died ? What if it had happened already ? What if it was happening even now ? He must get there at once to be with Eileen . He remembered her look at her baby , the look that was a transfusion of love . He belonged there , with her and the faint life he had brought into the murderous world . Eileen must know that she had an ally . Once and for all he would put a stop to his idiotic vagaries ; he must clamp them into the straitjacket of custom . Since he himself was weak , at the mercy of every wind that blew , he would invoke the assumedobligation of convention to drill some sanity into him . He found Liss , gave him a note to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would return , and bribed a waiting chauffeur to take him to Diakonissen Haus . Eileen was reading the Inferno . She had to cope also with a dictionary . She was astonished to see him . She let the books fall . " Stanley ! What a surprise ! I thought you were at the party . " " I told Mary I wanted to look in on you . I promised to come back . " He was very tense . He sat by the bed and took her hand . " I was just thinking of you  --  wondering who you were flirting with . What 's Stephanie wearing ? Does she look marvelous ? " She had not , evidently , given her undivided attention to Dante . " Stephanie 's not there . " " Oh , so that 's why ... " " I got worried . I got worried about the baby . "  | " He 's fine . I 'm beginning to feel hopeful . " She knocked wood on the headboard . " Has he opened his eyes yet ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's Sally wearing ? Her taste in clothes  --  no matter what she puts on . . . " " Eileen , I want you to marry me . " " What 's the matter , darling ? You 're in a state . What 's happened ? " " If you do n't marry me  --  I 'll be lost . I 'll go to pieces . " " Have you had a falling out with Stephanie ? " " Please , darling , do n't cross-question me . " " Is it on account of the baby you want to marry me ? That you think it 's your duty ? " " He 's part of it , of course  --  part of you . " " I 'll take care of him . You need n't worry about that . You see , darling  --  you did n't know it , did you ?  --  I 'm very vain . I want to be married for myself . I want you to be sure . " " I am sure . Why would I ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're so clever . I 'm not up to you . You 'll get famouser and famouser . . . " " I 'm torn to bits . You do n't know  --  how wayward I am . I 'm sick of it  --  sick of myself . " " Will it go away  --  the waywardness  --  if we 're married ? Might n't it get worse ? You 're in some sort of mood . " " I sure am ! " " Tell me . " " Is n't it enough that I want you to marry me ? What more can I say ? " " Are n't you writing your play for Stephanie ? " " What 's that got to do with it ? " " Wait . Give yourself a chance . How can I marry you when I know you 're in love with Stephanie ? When your play gets going you 'll be with her all the time . You 'll patch up your quarrel . Then where will I be ? It scares me . " She was light years away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would sound fantastic even to him . He could n't . He buried his head against her shoulder . He was praying for salvation . " Du bist mein Schatz , " he whispered.  | " Is that German ? " " Yes . It means you are my darling , my treasure , my love . " " Why do n't you say it in Italian ? Then I 'd have a chance ! " She held him close to her , kissing him . " Go back , darling . Go back to your party . Do n't worry . Things will straighten themselves out  --  between you and Stephanie . " On the barge , Grant found himself sitting , as Lowe had promised , between the Grand Duchess Marie and Varina . " You Americans , " the grand duchess was saying , " are really fearful snobs , are n't you ? " " Are we snobs , Stanley ? " said Varina . " Defend us . " The grand duchess did n't wait for Stanley 's defense . She went on , good-humoredly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , the customers flock to me  --  men as well as women . The other salesladies are so young and attractive and I 'm a plain old woman . You 'd think the girls would hate me , but they do n't . They 're very sweet . But it 's to me the customers come . And they chat , as if they were paying a social call . They 're so sympathetic  --  the fallen grand duchess , you see  --  and so tolerant because , although I 'm Russian , I 'm not a Bolshevik . It 's really very boring , almost as boring as it used to be at home when I was a grand duchess . You 'll forgive me , but I do n't think really I 've ever encountered such snobs as you Ameri-cans . " At this moment there was a thunderclap , a jag of lightning , a suddenwind and the flambeaux went out . They were sitting in darkness . There was laughter , little cries , the scrape of chairs pushed back . Grant looked up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill up for the Festival . From all over Europe and from the two Americas music buffs came to occupy the hotel rooms and rented villas they had booked a year in advance : society leaders , lumi/naries of the arts , simple millionaires , abdicated kings , the wives of presidents , the widows of prime ministers . Toscanini arrived . The shop windows sprouted his photographs as they used to do of royalty . The stern , classical profile was visible everywhere . He was indeed royal and , in his own evaluation , higher . Had he not announced that he was unavailable when the King of Italy called upon him ? None of the composershe played could , in their own lifetimes , have been received with anything like the rapture accorded Toscanini . The vast majority came , not to hear Mozart , Beethoven or Verdi , but to see the Maestro . He had , besides his devotion and austerity and command , the visual appeal of a great matinee idol . For the infatuated celebrants he was Mozart , Beethoven and Verdi  --  their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the ladies , even the tone-deaf ones , he was the fantasy hero of a love affair . Stephanie , in her freewheeling , independent manner , had , on one occasion , crystalized the feminine compulsion toward Toscanini . She had invited a friend to one of his concerts in New York . Just before the Maestro 's entrance Stephanie 's friend observed her carefullystuffing her ears with cotton . She sat , rapt , through the First Brahms . When it was over , she unstuffed and explained : " The music distracts me . It keeps me from concentrating on him ! " Rudolph Stohl came and took up residence in the archiepiscopal palace . Stohl had founded the Festival . He had fallen in love with the town and conceived the idea of bringing drama and music there in the summer . The reclame of his name and his willingness to bring his own productions to Salzburg had brought his idea to life . Of later years he had found his domain occupied by Toscanini . If he felt any resentment at this preemption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through the motions of treating him like an equal . Stohl was as much adored by ladies as Toscanini was , but , as he did not appear in public , his clientele was mostly limited to actresses who lived to be directed by him . Grant met Dr. Ogden for lunch in the Mirabelle , an open-air restaurantwhere , now , it was very hard to get a table . Ogden had no troublesince he was the house guest of Mary Kennicott who had given innumerableparties there . The proprietor , Mr. Kaszner , a Hungarian , treated Dr. Ogden with almost as much deference as he treated Lowe ,  |p121another  inveterate patron . He personally escorted him and Stanley to their table , transmitted their orders for drinks and had a little conferenceabout what they should eat . " The Huhn im Topf , " Dr. Ogden confided to Grant , " is marvelous here . What do you think , Mr. Kaszner ? " Mr. Kaszner made a gesture to convey that the quality of the Huhn im Topf could not be expressed in words . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat longer colloquy about the wine . They settled on a Riesling . Mr. Kaszner disappeared . " Well , Stanley , " said Dr. Ogden . " Kaetchen tells me you 're going to be married . " " That 's premature . Eileen quibbles . " " Familiar gambit . Playing hard to get . " " Eileen 's not like that . " " She 's the mother of your child . That should swing it . " " Not with her . She 's stubborn . " " She 'll succumb . Will that make you happy ? " " Happy ? I do n't know what that means . " Ogden laughed . He beamed at Stanley . " Good boy ! Beginning of wisdom . There is a marvelous sentence in Freud . He 'd been treating hysterics . He said to a colleague : Much is won if we succeed in transforming hysterical misery into common unhappiness . ' The trouble with our business these days is that our patientsexpect us to make them happy . " The drinks came . Ogden raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't waste time . Life is too short .

" Ah , thought Grant , his pose with me is going to be frankness . Aloud he said : " Including this appointment ? "  |p122Ogden  laughed . He had a very pleasant laugh , hearty but modulated . " Certainly . I had an impulse to talk to you . My impulses serve my calculations . " The Huhn im Topf arrived . It was , they both agreed , marvelous . The wine arrived . Dr. Ogden rhapsodized about the wine . Grant , not wishing to admit that he did n't know one wine from another , murmured approvingexclamations about the wine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " out to make a friend of you . " " Why ? " " Because you 're so popular . Everyone thinks the world of you . How 've you managed it ? " " Perhaps it 's because I 'm not a threat to anybody . " Ogden laughed . " You underrate yourself . That 's a mistake . " Grant felt himself flushing . He did n't like Dr. Ogden at all . But he , too , had come for a purpose . He must stick to that purpose . He had his own way of getting back at Dr. Ogden ! " I know your opinion of me . It 's based on nonsense . I know you 've swallowed whole all those rumors in Blue Hill about me and Sally 's mother . I mean to disabuse you of that prejudice . We should be allies . We have something in common . " " What 's that ? " " We 've both of us had no luck with the one girl we really want . We 're both of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . What sort of gambit was this ? But he felt a kind of triumph . His pulses throbbed . Aloud he said : " I ca n't really feel sorry for you . You do n't seem neglected . First Mrs. Frobisher . Now Mrs. Kennicott . " " The only women who 've ever been attracted to me are those who have been defeated by life . They 're losing the struggle , they expect me to bring them back . Tedious job . Impossible hours . Inconceivable mo-notony . " " Mary too ? " " She 's worse than Sally 's mother . Mary was on the verge when I met her . Suicidal . Sally 's mother had a disease she could cling to . Mary wasp123in a vacuum . Nothing to cling to . Well , I gave her a mission . To find a cure for the incurable . " " Do you know her husband ? " " Oh yes . Charming man . But he has the half-baked look in his eyes of a man who 's never had to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could n't meet a more delightful man . " " And in the others ? " " Then he 's not one of us . " Dr. Ogden sipped the wine appreciatively . " I suppose you had an austere upbringing . " " Yes . I did . " " My parents were agnostic , so I 've never had a moment of guilt about anything . " " You 're lucky . " " And I suppose with you the religious thing is all intertwined with the racial thing . Must be particularly bothersome just now . The thing about the Jews is that  --  en masse  --  they lack charm . That 's why they 're not popular . " Grant felt that the collar of his shirt was too tight . He ran his fingeraround the inside of it to loosen it . But he kept his voice even . " Does Kaetchen lack charm ? " " I said  --  en masse . " There was a moment 's silence . Grant kept struggling with his collar . " Have I offended you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypersensitive . All minorities are . My father was n't a religiousmaniac but in a way he was worse . Poverty-stricken intellectual . He was so bloody high-minded . Thoreau was his God . He rammed Thoreaudown my throat till I regurgitated him . He 'd quote him : Poverty is life near the bone where it is sweetest . ' He sure kept us close to the bone all right , but I escaped it . " " No hand-sawn cabins for you . " Ogden smiled . " I do n't mind telling you , Stanley , I 'm quite well off . " " And I know where you got it , " said Stanley to himself . He wanted to say it out loud but lacked the courage.  |p124Ogden  knew what he was thinking . " And I was quite well off by the time I met Sally 's mother . " " Large practice , I suppose . " " I worked my way through high school and through a jerkwater medical school . Put up my shingle in Cleveland . Nose and throat . Tonsillectomies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonsils . One day I gave up tonsillectomy for the soul ! I discovered that the poor have tonsils but only the rich have souls . " Grant 's hand reached reflexively for the pad in his jacket pocket . But he controlled himself . It would n't do to let Ogden catch him taking notes . He would remember that remark and give it to his Ogden . " The truth is , Dr. Ogden ... " " Drop the Doctor . ' You 're not my patient . Kenneth is my name . Call me Ken . I 'm not much of a doctor anyway . " " You 're the head of Mary 's clinic . " " I am . I 've got some first-rate men there . Whizzes . That 's what I am good at . Digging up scientific talent . What I really am , dear Stanley , is an administrator . " He winked at Grant . That wink won Stanley over . He felt a sneaking liking for Ogden . " What 's the truth you were going to tell me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewildered , off base , since I came here . I do n't understand anything at all  --  about myself  --  or anyone else . Stephanie baffles me completely . " " A masochist . On the lookout for what will make her suffer . " " Is that it ? " " Part of it . " " Stephanie and Ian . Is n't that strange ? " " Not at all . Very common . Most of the fellers you met at Mary 's party the other night were pansies . They 're attractive and charming and the girls love them . Those that are double-gaited often make very good husbands  --  especially for older women . " Grant was wistful . " So many and so glamorous . We seem to be a minority . Are we ab-normal ? " Ogden laughed . " No , we 're not abnormal . We may come to it but not yet . There 'll bep125a cure one clay for these fellows and it wo n't come from us . It 'll come from the biochemists , that 's what my fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 'll be a much duller world without them . I 'll hate to see them go . " Grant looked at his wristwatch . " I think I 'd better be going , " he said . " I 've got to get back to work . " He could n't wait to get back to his room . He wanted to put down what Ogden had said about switching from tonsillectomy to the soul . There was so much he wanted to do to his play . " Oh , wait a bit . I 've asked Sally to join us . She 'll be along any min-ute . " Grant felt a pang of jealousy . " You see a lot of Sally , " he said . " It 's you she wanted to see . She was on her way to visit Eileen . She wanted to report . " " I really have to go . " " Surely the masterpiece can wait a few minutes . She 's an extraordinarygirl , that Sally . Very deep . Remarkably clever . Really precocious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You seem to be very good friends . " " She hates me . She thinks I murdered her mother . Perhaps you 'll tell her the truth ? " " Do I know the truth ? " Ogden laughed . " Sure you do . I just told you . I kept her mother alive . I gave her something to live for . And at what cost to me ! " " Have n't you revealed your occupational hazards to Sally ? " " We do n't discuss it . It would be much better to come from you . You see ! I told you my impulses were calculated . Now you know why I wanted to see you . I want your help with Sally . " Stanley stared at him . He really did n't know what to make of this man . Ogden was aware of his effect . " You 'll find few men as candid as I am . But do n't think I 'm discouraged . I 'd welcome your help but I think I can do without it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not discouraging , is it ? Hatred is intensity of feeling . I 'm on her mind . She thinks about me all the time , she  --  "  |p126Ogden  jumped up . " Here she is ! " he said happily . " Our girl ! " Sally , in a lavender dirndl , walked up to them . Her arms were bare . She looked like a shepherdess in a Watteau , a shepherdess with a privateincome who took on sheep as a hobby . She took Grant 's breath away . She kissed him on the cheek . She nodded to Ogden , scarcely looking at him . " I 've just seen Eileen , " she said to Grant . " And the baby . Both flourishing . " " Thank you , " said Grant . He got up . " I 'm afraid I 've got to get back to work . " " Surely , " said Ogden , " you can take fifteen minutes . " " No , " said Sally , " let him go . Work comes first . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Ogden ? He stood on the sidewalk and hailed a cab . He could n't make head nor tail of anything . In the cab he took the pad out of his jacket pocket and wrote down Ogden 's remark , " The poor have tonsils but only the rich have souls . " That would get a laugh , Grant was sure . He would rewrite Dr. Ogden from the beginning : a compulsive gambler of the emotions , tantalized incessantly to see how far he could go , a vulgar romantic , a cheapjack of diabolism . He would have one of the unemployed young fellows hovering about Sally in the play say all this about him . Give it to that young firebrand the Catholic Communist . But what was Sally ? Was she a nymphomaniac ? Had she been jealous of her mother , had she contrived to take her mother 's lover to herself ? It was awful having these thoughts , but he was having them . He felt lost in this world  --  homesick . He thought again of that little boat winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If his baby lived , he would take him and Eileen .. . The cab was tooling its way beside the Salzach . Turning the corner from a side street he saw a tall figure in the uniform of a storm trooper walking with a girl . There was something familiar about the set of his shoulders . It was his barber . Grant had been to him almost every day since his first morning 's walk in the village . The girl had her arm through his . She looked up , smiling at her tall companion . It was Schwester . Grant forgot about his play . He forgot about Sally and Dr. Ogden.  |p127He  sat in terror . He had brought into being a frail life who had , unasking , been hurtled into a world that would soon be controlled by the vast armaments of the Mustache . For the moment , this sin drove out his other sins . By the time Grant got back to his room at the castle , his encounter with Dr. Ogden , the appearance of Sally , made him realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . He would begin by writing a third act and then rewrite the first two acts to live up to it . In his excitement he forgot about the Mustache , about his child , about Eileen . That was another undiscovered country ! Eileen , apparently , was not a softie ; she had standards of her own . But he could n't stop thinking of Ogden : that strange and magnetic personality , seemingly so candid , actually impenetrable . What on earth was Ogden thinking of ? And Sally  --  what on earth was she thinking of ? It was inconceivable , was n't it , that she was tempted , like the heroine of a Greek tragedy , to have a liaison with her mother 's murderer ? Sally was as far as possible from being a classical Greek heroine ; she was an American Beauty rose . Was Ogden really thinking of throwing over Mary , the clinic , the fortune , the very likely succession to her ailing husband ? Could it be that he was really in love with Sally ? How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bound to find out sooner or later . Did n't it make her wonder that Ogden was seeing so much of Sally ? His own treatment , his own first version , lying there on the table , was far too bleak , " on the line , " unsubtle . His hand reached into his jacket pocket for his note pad ; he read Ogden 's remark about givingup tonsillectomies for the soul : " The poor have tonsils but only the rich have souls . " He would give that to his Dr. Ogden right away ; he knew just where . But it went beyond that . What on earth was Ogden going to do ? Evidently Sally had promised him nothing yet . He had said that he and Sally never talked about the past , about her mother ,  |p128about  the scenes in Cleveland with Mr. Slater . What then did they talk about ? Of course , he was waiting to see how far he could get with Sally , what the prospect was , before extricating himself from Mary . He tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Ogden . What would he do if he were Ogden ? Suddenly he saw what Ogden might do . He saw ! This vision drove him to his work table . He did n't care what the actual Dr. Ogden would do , but he knew what his Dr. Ogden would do . He began to write at breakneck pace , starting with a stage direction : At Rise : Living room of Leonie Frobisher 's summer cottage in Blue Hill , Maine . Late afternoon . Dr. Kenneth Ogden , in tweed jacket and slacks , is sitting in front of the fireplace smoking a cigar . He is in deep thought . He gets up frowning , pondering deeply . Suddenlyan idea strikes him . The impact is so powerful that it stops him in his walk . The frown disappears ; he almost smiles . He is so seized by the sudden emergence of this idea that he resumes his walk , this time in excitement . He stamps out his cigar in an ashtray . He is like a man with a mystic illumination ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its megalomania . He is exalted . Then he is seized by impatience ; he can not wait for his idea to be executed . He walks to the glassed-in verandah at the back . He calls . KENNETH : Leone ! LeonieiNow he must bring Leonie in . He read his original stage direction for her , on her first appearance . He had described Stephanie and given her an accent . He crossed all this out vindictively . He had decided already that he must get an American actress for the part . Moreover , he knew who ! He wrote the new stage direction , with such tensity and at such speed as if to lay forever the ghost of Stephanie : Leonie Frobisher comes in , running a little , breathless , like a young girl . As she has a daughter of twenty-one , Leonie must be herself well over forty but , at the moment , she might be sixteen . She is slim , girlish , in a young and quivering ecstacy of living and anticipation . For Leonie , her daughter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself biologically  --  ap129lovely apparition who hovers intermittently in the wild garden of her life . There is something , for all her gaiety , heartbreaking about Leonie , something childish and childlike  --  an acceptance of people instantly and uncritically at the best of their own valuation . She is impulsive and warmhearted and generous to a fault . Her own fragile and exquisite loveliness she offers to the world half shyly , tentatively , bearing it like a cup of precious liquid of which not a drop must be spilled . A spirituelle amoureuse , she is repelled by the gross or the voluptuary ; this is not hypocrisy  --  it is , in Leonie , a more serious defect than that . In the world in which she moves hypocrisy is a social lubricant , but this myopia  --  alas for Leonie !  --  springs from a congenital and temperamental inability to face anything but the pleasantest and the most immediately appealing and the most flattering aspects of things  --  in life and in her own character . At this moment , though , she is the loveliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving all the world , with particular emphasis on Dr. Kenneth Ogden . LEONIE : Darling ! Have I kept you waiting ? It 's this dress ! It 's new ! I put it on for you . Like it ? ( She twirls around for Ogden . He watches her . She comes up to him ) Do n't you like it ? KENNETH : It 's lovely . Whatever you put on . LEONIE ( Peers at him ) : Kenneth . What is it ? KENNETH : You 're perceptive . LEONIE : You look as if you had something on your mind . KENNETH ( Rallying her ) : Instead of vacuous  --  as usual ? LEONIE ( Laughs , a little tinkling laugh ) : Darling ! There 's always so much in your mind . And there 's nothing whatever in mine . What can I do about it ? Sally 's so serious , interested in causes , intellectual . Sally 's always telling me to improve my mind . There 's nothing much to improve . But I have my own vanity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LEONIE : I leave the big issues to the professional altruists . I just do what I can toward making those around me happy . That 's my vanity ! KENNETH : YOU do a good deal . LEONIE ( Tenderly , dotes on him ) : If I make you happy  --  it 's all I ask . KENNETH ( After a moment ) : Leonie . I have to talk to you . I have decided  --  to be completely honest with you . You deserve no less . LEONIE ( A bit sobered ) : Oh , dear ! Whenever anybody tells me they 're going to be honest with me  --  I tremble . Be honest , if you must . Be as honest as you like  --  but do n't hurt my feelings ! KENNETH : I feel like a man on a great height , irresistibly tempted to jump over . The fact is , Leonie .. . LEONIE ( Clutched by terror at last  --  she is pitiful ) : I ca n't standit , Ken ! KENNETH : I have fallen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to tell you . LEONIE ( In a strained voice ) : Is it anyone I know ? I 'd prefer it to be  --  someone I do n't know . KENNETH : It is someone you know . LEONIE ( Instinctively puts her hands to her ears to shut out the horrid sound ) : Do n't tell me . I 'd rather not know . KENNETH : Unfortunately  --  I must tell you.  |p131LEONIE  ( Sits , bracing herself ) : Who is it ? KENNETH : Sally . LEONIE ( Stupefied ) : My Sally ? KENNETH : YOUr Sally . KENNETH ( Reads her thoughts ) : Say it . I 've said it to myself . I 've questioned my sanity myself . LEONIE : Sally 's a child . KENNETH : She is exactly twelve years younger than I am . That 's not an unbridgeable gap . Is it ? LEONIE ( After a moment ) : Is Sally in love with you ? KENNETH : I have n't the faintest idea . I have n't asked her . I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by me . I know that . I ca n't be mistaken about that . LEONIE : Why did n't you wait then  --  to tell me  --  till you did ask her ? ( Her voice rises ) Perhaps she 'd have told you  --  that you were deluded . Then you would n't have had to tell me . That 's all I would ask  --  not to know . Why could n't you have waited ? KENNETH : Sally distrusts me . Just as I know that she is attracted , I know that too . Her friends distrust me . They think I am a charlatan . They think I am mercenary . ( Humorously ) To tell you the truth , darling , until this inexplicable thing happened to me  --  I half agreed with them . ( Leonie 's head sinks . She presses the scarf she is wearing to her face )  |p132LEONIE  : I did n't think you could be so .. . KENNETH : I did n't think so either . I am really amused by myself . I have always made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to . You do n't know what I 've had to pull myself up from , what my origins were . And now , after all these years of control , I have succumbedto an inconsistency . I 've had to revise my whole notion of myself . Sally is the youth I 've never had , the security I 've never had , the home I have longed for . ( Leonie , her face in her scarf , merely shakes her head . Kenneth goes on ) It is the first time I have ever yielded to an impractical temptation . And I have always been eminently practical . LEONIE ( In a strangulated voice ) : Why did you have to tell me before  --  before . . . ? KENNETH : Before I told Sally ? Before I found out from Sally ? So I could come to her with clean hands . So that I could tell her that I 've burned my bridges behind me . So that I could come to her with nothing to offer except my feeling for her . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance  --  that she might love me , I have given everything up : an assured future , the clinic , you , everything . ( Leonie gets up , starts pacing the room , clinging to anger as to a lifeline ) LEONIE : To persuade her of your disinterestedness ! KENNETH : Exactly . LEONIE : Hateful ! You 're hateful . KENNETH ( Sadly ) : You say this at a moment when , for the first time in my life , I think , my heart is full of love . And for you too . LEONIE : And I suppose you feel  --  that if you fail with Sally . . . KENNETH : I wo n't fail.  |p133LEONIE  : But if you do , I suppose you feel  --  that you 'll get me back . . KENNETH ( Drily ) : I 'd try . LEONIE ( Faces him ) : I 'd kill myself first . KENNETH : But that 's where I came in ! I saved you from that . Re-member ? LEONIE : Yes . You saved me from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Now I will . Now I am alone and I will . KENNETH : Do n't stoop to blackmail , darling . You 're better than that . LEONIE : I 'll go to Sally . I 'll tell her what you are . I 'll tell her . KENNETH : That might be even better . LEONIE ( She changes . She thinks suddenly that this is a bad dream ) : Kenneth . I beg you  --  do n't do this . Sally will be horrified . Darling , I beg you  --  you must see  --  that it 's insane . It flashed through Grant 's mind as he was writing that perhaps he would make Sally Leonie 's stepdaughter , her husband 's daughter by an earlier marriage . He would think about that . But , just now , he was writing Kenneth 's reply to Leonie . KENNETH : Because I am forthright you think me insane . LEONIE : But Sally is in love  --  with that nice boy she 's been seeing , Will Talbot . KENNETH : ( This stirs Kenneth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : That 's how little you understand her . That puking little unemployed nobody with his half-baked Socialist ideas . When I hear the chatter of Sally 's friends it makes me sick . While theyp134prate of cooperative commonwealths , the strong man takes power and rides over their backs , which is all their backs are fit for . Never has the opportunity for the individual career been so exalted . So . . . ( He makes a wide gesture ) horizonal . House painters and minor journalists become dictators of great nations . ( He becomesless tense , smiles , makes a gesture of modest self-assertion indicatingthe room as part of his conquest ) Look what I have already done , unaided , alone . From an impossible distance I have come to you . I have come to Sally . What might we not do together  --  Sally and I ? LEONIE : Sally 's different . Sally 's idealistic . You do n't want the same things . KENNETH : She will . I am endlessly romantic , Leonie . And endlessly realistic . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want everything . LEONIE ( Walks away from him ) : And you do n't care how you get it ! KENNETH : Do n't be moralistic , Leonie  --  I beg you . I am directly in the tradition of your own marauding ancestors . You do n't know about them but I do . They pass now for pioneers  --  actually they fell on the true pioneers and wrested what they had away from them by sheer , brutal .. There was a knock on the door . Grant thought he 'd heard a knock but ignored it . It was repeated , more insistently . In a rage at being interrupted , without letting go his pen , he shouted , " COME IN ! " The door opened . It was Stephanie . " Darling ! I interrupted the poet while he 's working ! Can you forgive me ? " It darted through Grant 's mind as he rose to embrace her that this knock , so little ago , would have been for him the be-all and end-all of his existence . He saw that Stephanie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . He led her inside . " But , darling ! How marvelous to see you ! When did you get back ? " " Half an hour ago . You 're the first person I wanted to see . " " You look wonderful . " " Do I ? Do you think I do ? "  |p135He  stared at her . There was something different about her . She had , Grant thought , a somewhat chastened look , the pure lines of her face , her shining dark eyes  --  she looked , somehow , enhaloed . Had Stephaniegone in for sainthood ? He led her to a chair . " Did Ian come back with you ? " " No . I left him in Gastein . That 's all over with . That 's all behind me . " He scanned her face . " You look different somehow . " " I am different . I 've turned over a new leaf . I 'm glad it shows . " " You 'll have to tell me all about it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And Eileen ? And your child ? How are they ? " " It was a narrow squeak  --  for the baby , I mean  --  but I think he 's going to be all right . Dr. Witte is keeping them in the hospital for anothertwo weeks . Just to make sure . But it 's all right . Kaetchen 's looking for an apartment  --  for Eileen and the baby . " " Why do n't they come here ? I 'd love it . Please . How wonderful it would be to have a baby  --  your baby  --  in this gloomy house ! " " It 's sweet of you . I do n't know whether . .. " " I 'll ask Eileen myself . I 'll make her come . She must come ! " " I 'm sure she 'd love to , " said Grant , who was privately dismayed by the idea . " But it 's so dark in here and that silly bathtub ! I could kill Liss for putting you in here . What a terrible room ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would n't you like that ? " " Thank you , darling . I 'm used to this now . It 's only a few more weeks anyway . " There was a silence . Grant looked longingly at his manuscript . Stephaniecaught the look . " I long to read your play . May I read it ? " " I 'm rewriting it . " " But Ian says the first act is done . Let me read that . I 'll begin to study it , to memorize it  --  right away . " " I 'm revising that too . In fact , I 'll have to rewrite it . I 've got a new idea on it . " " How wonderful ! How exciting ! It does n't matter . I know it will bep136beautiful . And you 'll see ! I'lI work hard . You 'll be pleased with me . I promise . I 'll think of nothing else . I ca n't tell you what it means to me . I ca n't tell how grateful I am to you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! " She was on the verge of tears . " Darling , one thing I want to tell you . It might worry you , so I want to tell you . You know my bad habits . I have no secrets from my poet . I want to tell you , solemnly and sincerely . I want to tell you , I have given them up , all those habits . You need have no worry , not a shred of worry . You will have no trouble with me , no trouble at all , when I come to do your play . " " I hope you wo n't be too saintly . How will I live up to you ? " She laughed , threw her arms around him and kissed him . " Do n't worry , darling . I 'll be saintly in moderation . " " Not fanatical ? " " Not fanatical . " She started again to go and again turned back . " And , darling , oh yes , I almost forgot . The Maestro has given me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with me ? That is , if Eileen is still in the hospital . " " She will be . " " You 'll come with me then ? " " I 'd love to . " " That 's heavenly . I 'd rather go with you than anyone in the world . " She was gone . Grant felt at sixes and sevens . Damn it , he 'd lost the thread on his work . Where was he ? Where had he left off ? And Stephanie'ssudden conversion of his play into a lifeline ! Was he committed ? He was always getting himself committed ! How could he get out of it ? Kaetchen . He would have to resort to Kaetchen . But Kaetchen wanted Stephanie to do his play . Grant had , indeed , begged for Kaetchen 's intercession . He looked down at his manuscript . He could n't twist it back now to suit Stephanie . Dr. Ogden was saying to Leonie : " I am directly in the tradition of your own marauding ancestors . " That meant the Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German accentonto the Ohio Frobishers . What should he have done ? Told Stephanieright out that she could n't have the part . That would have beenp137taw cruel . Just as she had turned over a new leaf ! No , he could n't have done that . Disconsolate , he sat down again at his desk . He stared at his manuscript . It seemed dull to him now . He could n't pick it up again . The elan was gone . Damn ! Why on earth had Stephanie chosen just this moment to knock at his door ? Well , he might as well go to the hospital to see Eileen . He would tell her she need n't worry about Stephanie , that be had decided on another actress for the part . No doubt about it . Life was complicated . Life was difficult . Was it because he was himself complicated ? Was it because he himself did n't have the courage to be what he was ? 14 . Aim 1ennicottLowe , Varina , Grant and Stephanie were having early dinner in the delectableMirabelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The air in the restaurant  --  as indeed in the entire town  --  was electric . Only Lowe was imperturbable and even bored . He was frank to admit that he could live very well without opera ; the fact that he could so well do without it convinced him that the rhapsodizing of others about it was an affectation . Stephanie and Varina pretended to be dismayed by his attitude , so familiar to them . " What a pity , " said Stephanie , " to waste a ticket on Kaetchen when so many people would sell their souls to get one . " " I 'll gladly give mine up , " said Lowe . " Find me a soul to save ! " Stephanie admonished Grant . " Do n't believe a word he says , Stanley darling . He 's as excited as any of us . Nothing in the world would induce him to give up his ticket . " " Have it your own way , " said Lowe equably . " I 've slept through many Fidelio 's . I 'll sleep through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell you . I 've been up half the night with Stohl getting ready for Saturday 's performance of Everyman . I detest Everyman . I 've always hated it . "  | " It 's an allegory , is n't it ? " said Grant . " That does n't make it any better . " " It 's Rudolph 's war-horse , " put in Stephanie . " He has to trot it out . People expect it . " " What does it say ? " said Lowe . " That when you die you have to give up everything . Who does n't know that ? Why a play about death ? It 's not our realm . Life is our realm . One has nothing to do with the other . Trying to imagine , even , what death is like , is an act of life . You may imagine till you 're blue in the face and you 'll not get closer . Death is totally uninteresting except for the effect its inevitability has upon the living . No . I detest this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lowe had spoken with a fervor unusualfor him . Suddenly , in this canopied and glittering restaurant , Grant found himself remembering his early horror of death when he was a child in Xenia . After he had gone to bed he would hear his father in the next room mournfully intoning his night prayer , a Hebrew prayer which was an effort to fend off a possible visit during the night of the dreaded Malach H'Amovis , the Angel of Death . Grant had been so terrifiedat the possibility of this angel summoning him while he was asleep that he used to clutch the posts of the brass bed to resist the pull of the invader . He permitted himself a fantasy : the Malach H'Amovis , gaunt , hooded , faceless , coming into this restaurant , strolling about noiselessly among the ranks of tables , silently tapping , making reservations . He looked at Kaetchen . His heart sank . Lowe was pale , his skin sallow , only his dark eyes alive . He felt a sting of apprehension for Lowe . He had spoken with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fear ? Was he unwell ? Was he ravaged by some illness of which he spoke to nobody ? Fear for Kaetchen clutched at Grant 's heart , " What would you think , " drawled Varina , " if I were to go to Gastein ? Have a try at dethroning Vesper ? A quite disinterested journey  --  tip salvage Ian for our sex ? " " Why not ? " said Kaetchen , his equanimity restored by being called upon for advice in the realm of which he was the acknowledged master . " Why not ? The Fifth Crusade . " Stephanie turned to Varina . " No , darling , " she said . " Do n't go . Nothing can be done . Vesper is too clever . Too malign . "  | " Why malign ? " asked Lowe . " Oh , but you do n't know , " protested Stephanie , " you do n't know Ves-per ! " " I do know him , " said Lowe . " I know him very well and I like him very much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propelled by naturein a certain way and he follows his nature , just as Stanley and I follow ours  --  or try to !  --  and just as you and Varina follow yours . Are we malign ? Are you malign ? It 's simple nonsense . " " I never thought of it that way , " said Varina thoughtfully . " I believethere 's an answer to it but I just ca n't think what it should be . Can you , Stanley ? " " No , " said Grant , " I ca n't . " " Still , " Varina insisted , " I think Ian should be saved . " " Try , " said Lowe . " By all means try . Join the relay . When you come back , Stephanie can take another turn . Keep the relay going . Olympic game . " " I 'll never go there again , " said Stephanie . " I never want to see Ian again . " She turned to Grant for confirmation . " You know that , do n't you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Stephanie 's vow to him , that she would abandon delights henceforth and devote herself exclusively to her career . He was no longer comfortable with Stephanie . Ile could not suppress the shame he felt about her ; he tried to forget the incident that caused it , but he could n't , although he told himself over and over that Stephanie herself must have forgotten it . And now she was reminding him of a commitment he had made which it might be very difficult for him to meet . He brooded . He kept swallowing the wine which the waiters kept supplying . Through a haze he heard Lowe announcing that it was time to go . Not only did Grant find himself at the core of European culture but at the core of the Festspielhaus as well , sitting beside Stephanie in the center of the second row in the orchestra , directly opposite the door underthe stage through which Toscanini was presently to make his entrance . Some members of the orchestra were already in their chairs , twanging or softly tootling their instruments . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full , the two seats on the other side of Grant were still unoccupied . A loud buzzing of conversation rose to the ceiling like a beehive in swarm . As he had never heard Fidelio and had no notion of what it was about , Grant busied himself with reading the scenarioof the story in the leaflet program provided by an usher . Stephanie was chatting with a friend who sat the other side of her . But Grant found that reading the program scenario was a chore beyond his capacity . It was written in pidgin English , in strange , boneless Germanic sentences often without predicates and with the verbs coming so late that you had , by the time you reached them , forgotten what the subject was . First , he got into a deep tangle with the overtures . There were four , he deduced ; three entitled Leonore and one Fidelio . He read the numbers and then was told that these numberings were incorrect . " From the original performance Number two redacted was , SG he is therefore correctly Number one . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came off never . In the copyist 's hand were the score and parts but by Beethoven corrected were and only after the composer 's death . " Was Beethoven a revenant ? " For the secondrevision the overture was intended but was not ready . " Grant 's mind reeled . He decided to let the program narrator have his own way with the overtures and settled down to try to assimilate the story . Here he got into deeper trouble . He could n't make head nor tail of it : " The story consists in Florestan a Spaniard nobleman from Spain who , from the sinister Pizarro is put in the prison but Rocco the jailer is with Marcellina the jailer 's daughter in love until he meets Fidelio who is the wife of Florestan secretly in the prison inserted and truly Eleonora . " Grant studied and studied but he could n't cope . It just could n't be made out . Suddenly he was aware of a great stir in the house ; the buzzing changed its character . It became sibilant , murmurous , ecstatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , to occupy the two empty seats beside him , were the newly married Duke and Duchess of Windsor . The duke sat next to him . The theater was now full and the eyes of the audience converged on the bridal couple . For Grant it was n't necessary to stare ; he had only to take them in out of the corner of his eye . The duchess was beautifullycomposed , seemingly unaware of being the focus of attention . Her chic was an enameled glaze , encasing and protecting her . Enclosed inp141its lacquer she sat cool , tranquil , comfortable . The duke , far less composed , seemingly a bit edgy , without the thin but durable carapace which protected his wife , looked flurried , uncomfortable . He shifted about in his chair , then he sought refuge in the program ; he buried himself in it . Grant covertly watched him while he undertook the printed journey through the mazes of Florestan 's prison life . " He does n't know what he 's in for ! " Grant thought gleefully . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He held the program somewhat closer to his eyes . His eyebrows came together ; furrows of anxiety showed in his forehead . There was a scatter of applause ; Toscanini was making his entrance . The duke and duchess had somewhat deflated the excitement of the Maestro 's appearance , but the Maestro was intent on other things , he paid no attention , he scarcely nodded , turned his back on everybodyand entered , after a sharp rap with his stick , into close communion with Beethoven . Grant was fascinated by the curve of the Maestro 's cheek ; it was a line of great strength and beauty . Grant thought that he had never seen a cheekline like that , so grave , so ominous , so sculptural . The house lights dimmed as the Maestro beat down for the first bars of one of the overtures . Grant looked at the duke on his left . He had n't lifted his eyes from the program . In the half-light from the stage he was deep in it , determined to unravel its mysteries . By this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wrinkles , furrows of despair and persistence . Grant felt pity for him . Ile felt like whispering : " Dear duke , give up ! Acknowledge defeat . I 've tried it and it 's no good . Toscanini is before you and the opera is about to reveal itself . Attend to them ; perhaps you 'll get something from them ! " But of course he did n't , he could n't . But what a pity it was , what a waste it was ! For a long time the duke never looked up from his program at all . All during the evening he kept taking furtive glances at it , to chart him through the macabre and lowering tides surging on the stage . Four rows behind Grant and the newlyweds sat Mary Kennicott with Dr. Ogden , Sally and young Federn . Mary Kennicott did n't have to study the program to find out what Fidelio was about . She knew it , both the score and the libretto , by heart . As the lights dimmed , she closed her eyes merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she and Wyman on their honeymoon had traveled to Zurich to hear Bruno Walter conduct it . It was after that performance , in their hotel suite , that Wyman had first undergone some manifestations of his illness . She had , it seemed to her , been listening to Fidelio all her life . Many years before she had read a book by an English scientist and music Iover , John W. N. Sullivan , called Beethoven : His Spiritual Development . She had written , from her parents ' house in Boston , an ecstaticletter to the author and had received from him a sympathetic reply . They had exchanged a few letters . She thought now of Beethoven 's isolation , of his suffering , of his poverty , of his affliction , of his lovelessness , of his superhuman and heartbreaking strength , as described by this author . However , the Englishman had written slightingly of Fidelioand Mary , in one of her letters , had argued with him about this . " The string quartet , " Sullivan had written , " is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the least . Beethoven wrote one opera , not one of his most successful works , and that at a time when his creative activity , through its very activity and abundance , was not perfectly discriminating . " Mary had written passionately , expressing her disagreement with this judgment  --  " the only flaw , " she had written , " in your beautiful book . " The author had written back tolerantly , wondering whether his correspondent 's feeling about Fidelio was not subjective , " programmatic . " Mary remembered this now . Her feeling was indeed subjective . She could never watch the scene in which Florestan is buried in the pit without thinking of the pit in which her husband himself was intermittently buried . The music was so familiar to Mary that it permeated and deepened her introspections . To her parents ' and grandparents ' house on Corn  --  monwealth Avenue , the Brahmins of the intellectual and artistic world had come : her grandmother used to tell her of sitting next to Mr. Longfellowat dinner and his amusing remarks . The photographs of William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscribed to her father and mother . A dark and shy young girl , she was thrilled when Santayana told her that he was attracted by the " luminosity " of her face . She lived on this compliment for weeks . She studied her face to read luminosity into it . She had a crush on Santayana . But she came to observe that he had an extraordinary knack of advancing and **25;8711;TOOLONG . Mary grew up surrounded by distinction , butp143this only accentuated her shyness . She was always conscious that she was too thin . She was angular . She grew up envying roundness . She had been resigned to spinsterhood when she met Wyman . It was a miracle ... they suited each other perfectly . Their discovery of each other wase discovery of the world . He shared her passion for music . They layed duets together . They invited a chamber music quartet to spendmonth with them at the summer home of her parents on the North Shore . They would decide in a moment to go to Stuttgart or Bayreuth or Hamburg or Edinburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an art exhibition . When the dread affliction struck Wyman , it seemed like a rebuke to them for having been so happy . They had made a pact . It bad been Mary 's idea . If he could be cured , well and good . If not , she would not survive him . In one of his depressed states he had attempted suicide . She had prevented it in time . It was after that they had made their pact . She had , in a sense , made a pact with Dr. Ogden also . She had never expressed it , but it had been in her mind . He was so healthy , so authoritative , so extrovert , that it seemed to her somehow that illness could not exist in his presence . He  --  and the clinic she had founded under his direction  --  were her last chance and Wyman 's last chance . But from the blight of her life with Wyman love had sprouted anew ; she had a strongly sensual nature in conflict with her Puritan heritage  --  and Wymanhad encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew now , deceived herself . She had been aware long since that the stratagem she had employed , the fiction that Ogden would save Wyman , was hollow . She had employed a lover , that 's what it came down to . She no longer believed in Ogden as a healer . He was so magnetic , so confident , she hadared his sense of his own omnipotence . He would plumb the secret that as at the heart of Wyman 's malady . But , she realized it now as she listened to Leonore 's lovely aria in which she yearns for her imprisoned husband  --  imprisoned in as dark a pit as Wyman 's  --  she had long since ceased to believe in Ogden as the liberator of her husband . She did n't even think he cared very much . He had turned over the research to others . He was , he himself had admitted it and was proud of it , an " administrator . " He had no part , really , in the work that was being done by the doctors on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were keen , they were assiduous , they were dedicated . But they did not inspire thep144belief she had at first had in Ogden . When she spoke to them they were smilingly pessimistic . The enemy was elusive . They never gave her the sense that they could counter his elusiveness . She looked for a moment at Sally . How lovely she was , how cool . What was she feeling ? You could n't tell , you could never tell . She began to think of Mrs. Frobisher , of Sally 's mother . She felt a strong identification with her . Mrs. Frobisher must have felt that in Dr. Ogden she had met a savior who would stanch the growth of the dark flower that was blossoming to kill her . It was her own life she had entrusted to Ogden ; that was all right , that was hers to confide , but she had confided Wyman 's . She was contemptible . She was obsessed . Whose life did she want to save , Wyman 's or her own ? Wyman had encouraged her belief in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a ruse , this confidence , to give her the courage to strip herself of guilt and to get from Ogden possiblythe life that had been denied her with him ? Mrs. Frobisher had not loved her husband and had been clear about whom she did love . But she loved Wyman . Her heart ached for Wyman . She had agreed to their pact in holy sincerity . Around the margin of her thoughts she beheld Leonora , she saw Toscanini 's stick inditing the curve of her voice as Leonora promised , if she could not save Florestan from the grave , to prepare to follow him into it . Mary made up her mind . She would leave at once for California to join Wyman . The fun they had together in what Wyman humorously referred to as his " outside days " would go on : the jokes , talks of books and music , listening to records . She would never risk again , however , importing an orchestra to give a concert in their drawing room . Perhaps she might risk a string quartet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed a lover . She had never said it to herself so brutally before . Was he not free then to seek other employment ? She thought of Varina . She thought of Stephanie . They were both demonized by desire . She stole a look at Sally . She was not obsessed . She was calm . She was inscrutable . She was cool . She would never be carried away . She leaned back in her seat conscious of relief at her decision to go back to Wyman . It was lustral . She would tell Ogden right away . She would tell him after the supper party she was giving at the castle , after everyone had gone . She would leave tomorrow . What would be the effect on Ogden ? Would he offer a token resistance ? The lustral moment passed . Ques/lions nagged her . How much had Sally to do with her decision ? Ogden had told her that he was fond of Sally in an avuncular way and that he was determined to rid Sally 's mind of the prejudice , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung to the belief that he had destroyed her mother and , moreover , for materialistic reasons . Mary was too proud and too withdrawn to question this , even to the point of c-unment that Sally , considering that she hated Ogden , was nevertheless willing to spend considerable time with the object of her hatred . She could n't stoop to that , even disguised as banter . In her misery she was conscious of pity for Stephanie and Varina . She loved them . They were both doomed somehow . And she herself , was she not doomed ? She thought of it without fear ; even with consolation . Across the rows between them she saw Grant lean toward Stephanie and whisper something to her . He was a strange creature , that Grant . Immature . He would always be immature , gauche , self-conscious , overeagerto please . Still , that was rather a nice trait . She thought that perhapsGrant found it fatiguing to live up to his reputation for cleverness . It was a strain on him , poor boy . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save you ? She supposed that it depended on how much the possessor believed in it . Beethoven was saved by his convictionof genius . He was saved . For what was he saved ? Without his genius he would have married a bar maid or a prostitute , got drunk , been happy as the great multitude counts happiness . In her compassion for Stephanie and Varina , she included Beethoven . He was part of the unending sorrow of the world . And yet , between herself and her two friends , she differentiated . They were all three obsessed , of course , but their obsessions , Stephanie 's and Varina 's , were unfathomable to her . The fact that they were in love with Ian , whose sexual interests were divided , had always been incomprehensible to her . She had so many dear friends of Ian 's persuasion , she loved to be with them , they were heavenly company , but the idea of being in love with them , of going to bed with them , was beyond her imagination . The first act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a lapse of mercy , the jailer , at Leonora 's insistence , had permitted the prisoners to go out for a few minutes into the sun and air . It was like that , just like that when Wyman emerged from his prison into the air and sun ofp146his " outside days . " She felt the clouded joy that swept the prisoners . As she watches the prisoners in their melancholy diversion , Marcellina , the jailer 's daughter , sings : Wir eilen so zum Sonnenlicht , Und scheiden traurig wieder . Die andern murmeln nieder ; Hier wohnt die Lust , die Freude nicht . How true , thought Mary . No joy ever again . The curtains began to close . Looking across she saw Ogden 's hand close over Sally 's , just for a second . She felt a pulse in the wound . How very true ! Mary apologized to her companions for not going out in the inter mission . It would be too hectic . Sally begged particularly but Mary w. stubborn . The melee in the restaurant-bar was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as if the audience had itself been locked in Beethoven 's prison and , moreover , condemned to silence , and now this dammed-up silence took its revenge in a cacophony of released gossip . Ravenously , the crowd fell on the recovered power of speech as ifwere food . Their private lives and thoughts had been arbitrarily put abeyance and now they pounded explosively to resume them . Indeedthose who were able to get to the counter where wurstel-brot and drinks were served stanched their hunger silently . But between the counter and the exit doors there was a dense crowd ; those who had made a more leisurely exit had no chance whatever of getting to it . Grant and Stephanie walked out behind the duke and duchess , whom a lane was made by the gaping onlookers as if invisible velvet ropes were following in their wake . But the progress of the little procession was royally slow . By the time it reached the restaurant room was packed solid . Grant and Stephanie were in despair of finding Kaetchen or Mary or Varina or Sally or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's Kaetchen , " she cried . " He 's with Lady Bellamine . " In the reading room of the Xenia Public Library , Grant had read memoirs of this fabulous lady . He suddenly remembered . He had been quite shocked by her candor : that the wife of a prime minister should have been so frank  --  and in print  --  about the agonies of giving birthp147In her pain , Lady Bellamine had written , she had clung piteously to her obstetrician . " Dear doctor , " she had pleaded , " do n't leave me . Please do n't leave me . Stay this night with me and , I promise you , I 'll stay with you any night you like ! " It had really startled Grant . A prime minister 's wife ! He tried to imagineMrs . Calvin Coolidge saying a thing like that and failed . When they finally reached them , Lady Bellamine embraced Stephanie . Kaetchen introduced Grant with the information that he was havinga play done in London next season and that the sets were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grant told herthat he in turn had been entranced by her memoirs . She took his hand in hers , and gazed into his eyes . " You have n't read them . You have n't really read them ! " " But I have . Every word of both volumes . In the library of Xenia , Ohio . " As Lady Bellamine still seemed faintly incredulous Grant repeated the childbirth story and admitted that he had been shocked . Stephanie , Kaetchen and Varina laughed . " And did n't you also say , somewhere in those lovely books , that you did n't really have a face  --  just two profiles stuck together ? " Lady Bellamine threw her arms around Grant and kissed him . She was overcome with pleasure . It was obvious that her literary accomplishment just at being read  --  meant more to her than any marginal glories she might have achieved . Grant liked that . " You must let me know , " she said , her hand on Grant 's arm , " the moment you come to London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your first night . Tetty is my nearest and dearest . He 'll be there too . " Lady Bellamine waved to someone . They looked . The duke and duchess were chatting cozily with a Nazi officer in a resplendent uniform and with a striking brunette in white satin . After a moment Grant recognized the officer . It was Prince Staufer-Wernecke . Grant felt a sudden diminution of the euphoria that had been buoying him up . Vague rumors about the duke 's sympathies cameto him . " The Cliveden set . " He did n't know precisely what it was or who belonged to it . The duke 's sympathies , he 'd heard , were with the One Up There , in the aerie . Damn ! Could one never get away from it ? Lady Bellamine was telling a story.  | " I take a poor view , you know , " she said with a tilt of her head toward the duke and duchess . " A very poor view . Do you know the favoritestory in London now ? " Grant shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreman . Suddenlyone of them throws down his tools and sits apart in a sulk . What 's the matter , Tom ? ' the foreman asks . Sorry , boss , ' says Tom . I ca n't work without the woman I love . ' " Rene Wolfsohn , his buffalo head high above the crowd , came up to them with the dark girl Grant had met at Le Havre . " Ah , Rene , " said Lady Bellamine looking up at him , " how is it u there ? " The dark girl shook hands with Grant and gave him again the war , smile with which she had greeted him at the landing . Everybody knew her , so her name was not mentioned . " It 's so nice to see you again , " she said to Grant . The intermission gong struck . Grant felt again what he had felt Le Havre : that he did n't want to be separated from Wolfsohn 's frien . Nevertheless , Stephanie took his arm and started to pilot him back . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have a su ject ! " After the bedlam of the intermission the darkened theater was res ful . Grant found himself sitting again beside Prince Stauffer-Wernecke friends . That is what the Windsors had become to him . Though he h. been welcomed so cordially by the brilliant widow of a prime minist Grant was again , abruptly , ill at ease , deflated , fearful . The spurious ultation with which he had entered the theater had evaporated entirely The unseen power of the Mustache in the aerie had descended to cr him . Grant stole a look at the duke . He was back at his program stud his brow furrowed , trying to pick up the story , presumably , where had left off . Toscanini reappeared , his medallioned face tense and se conveying somehow that the applause which greeted him was an of front . It was as if he knew that the audience had picked up its privy life during the intermission and that he resented its presence . The rel- tative with which the second act began was not calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone ; he is chained to the wall Grant was able to make out , in his somewhat improved German ,  |p149burden  of Florestan 's thoughts . They matched his own . " Terrible darkness . . . terrible silence . . . the darkness of the tomb . " For the second time that evening Grant found himself remembering the tenement In Xenia and his father 's night prayer , the hooded figure . The dread angel was back , the one he had absurdly seen stalking the restaurant tables at dinner . Surely this was morbid . He was an American . He was safe . He could get out of this cursed place any time he wanted . Presently , Leonora and the jailer come in and begin to dig Florestan 's grave . The Master Grave Digger , Grant reflected , was up there , just across the border , planning to dig many graves . Grant was furious with himself . The glamorous couple beside him had become potential enemies . Simply because of rumors about them which possibly had no basis In fact . Simply because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The duke leaned over to whisper something to his bride . Instinctively , Grant bent his head toward them with an impulse to eavesdrop . It was ridiculous . He felt like a spy in enemy country . He rebelled . Was this the only norm of judgment  --  the attitude of the entire race toward the One Up There ? Yes , it was . For him it was . Grant remembered a Yiddish play he had seen in Cleveland in which there was a very funny character at whom the audience , including himself , had roared with laughter . No matter what came up , no matter what any of the other characters said about anything , this little old man had an invariable and automatic response . His son-in-law read aloud an item from a newspaper : there had been a terrible earthquake in Bolivia . His father-in-law asks his stock question : " Is it good for Jews ? " Grant asked himself : was he getting to be like that ? He sat in agony , eviscerating himself . On the stage the opera was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He frees Florestan . He and Leonora are united . From the grave Florestan is brought back to life . After all the inhumanities , the opera ends in a jubilee of thanksgiving for mercy . But Grant was not comforted . The One Up There , he felt , would not be merciful . On the way back to the castle in Mary 's car , Sally insisted on sitting in front beside the driver . Mary , Dr. Ogden and young Federn sat inp150the back . Mary thought : " She insists on sitting in front because she fears that what there is between her and Ogden might become too manifest . " Mary dismissed it as a morbid thought but , nevertheless , it persisted . Had she not seen Ogden 's hand on Sally 's in the Festspielhaus ? She could n't bear it . She could n't . Anyway she would be out of it tomorrow . Tomorrow she would be on her way back to Wyman . In front , where she was sitting beside the open window , the soft air came in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was calm . She was triumphant . She felt a quiet power . She had achieved exactly what she wanted . Ogden 's letter was securely in her purse . Sally had thought things out carefully and had come to a decision . She was ready , now , at last , to talk to Mary . There would be a great many people at the party : Mary , seemingly , had invited everyone in Salzburg , including Toscanini , but Sally was sure that she could contrive to see Mary alone . She would tell her . She would tell her tonight . Under pretext of finding her lipstick , she opened her purse , just to make sure . Yes , there it was , Ogden'sletter . Her mind raced . The others would not be coming till very late . Stephanie , she was sure , would be going backstage to congratulate the Maestro and would be taking Varina and Kaetchen with her . Maybe , then , it would be better to talk to Mary before the party . Yes , that might be best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chatting with Ogden and Federn about the opera , Ma brooded . When should she tell Ogden that she was leaving tomorrow ? Late  --  late  --  after everyone had gone . What if he volunteered to come with her ? He would n't . Of course he would n't . But if he did  --  would n't it show that she was indeed morbid , that her imagination had run away , with her ? At the thought of this possibility her heart almost stopped . But it was absurd . It could n't be . She could n't be wrong . It was stupid of her to indulge such hopes . She was sure . He might make a show of token resistance but , she thought bitterly , he would succumb , very gracefully and with appropriate melancholy , to the inevitable . If she had to go , she had to go . As they came into Mary 's drawing room , Redding , her English butler , handed her a cable . " From my husband , " said Mary . " He 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm dying of thirst , " said Ogden . " I could n't get within a mile of that bloody bar ! " " Redding will provide , " said Mary . " Sally , come with me . " She led Sally into the small salon filled with the improvisations of Fischer von Erlach . As Sally followed her , her heart beat fast . Should she tell her now ? Why not tell her now ? She would . Perfect moment . Rut she held off , savoring the sense of power the impending revelation gave her , power still unexercised . She titivated herself for a moment before a mirror , cupid and gorgon and sunburst framed , a lake surrounded by fantasies in gold . Reflected in the mirror she saw Mary opening her husband 's cable . She heard a deep intake of breath , a gasp . She turned quickly . Mary had sunk to a sofa , the cable in her hand , staring at it , her lips pressed tight . Sally went to her swiftly . " Darling ! What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : DEAREST AND ONLY WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS I SHALL BE FREED LIKE FLORESTAN . YOU TOO . CONCLUSION OF UNDULYOUTSIDE DAY . WILL YOU THINK I AM A SPOILSPORT ?

She was staring into space . " I do n't understand it , " said Sally . " Wyman is dead , " said Mary . Sally took Mary 's hand . It was cold . She chafed it . Redding came in . " Your guests are arriving , madame , " he announced . " Thank you , Redding . I 'll be right there . " Redding went out . " Oh , but you must n't , " said Sally . " I 'll take care of it . I 'll just go outand . . . " " Thank you , dear . But I do n't want anyone to know . Not tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaetchen. "  |p152Mary  got up . She smiled faintly at Sally . " Will you be a darling ? Will you help me  --  to receive ? " Sally followed Mary into the hall. 15 . T be 6omnambutia5In the next few days Lowe found himself unusually busy . He saw Mary , Dr. Ogden and Sally off to America . That decision had been arrived at very quickly , overnight , after Wyman 's cable . Mary had explained to Lowe that she had found Sally unusually sympathetic from the beginning ; Sally had been with her when Wyman 's cable arrived , had stayed up most of the night with her , been an angel of quiet understanding . Mary had begged her to go with her to California and Sally had consented . Was not this sufficient evidence of her loyalty , her quality , her genius for friendship ? Lowe agreed ; he never quarreled with a fait accompli . Rudolph Stohl 's distinguished coterie was arriving by train and car from all over Europe . Lowe had to meet them , greet them , arrangefor their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace . He rested briefly from these labors by meeting Grant for afternoon coffee at the Cafe Bazaar . They chatted about the sudden departure of the odd trio for Santa Barbara . Lowe was not nearly as startled by the hegira to California as Grant was . To Lowe the behavior of his friends was always unpredictable . He noted it with the detachment of an ethnologistwho observes the sexual habits of an aboriginal tribe . This did n't mean that Lowe was n't attached to his friends ; he was ; he loved them as scientists who spend a long time in a Kaffir village often fall its love with the natives . " By the way , " said Lowe after they had exhausted the subject of the departed trio , " your son 's name is Amos . I thought you ought to know , Amos Grant . Not bad . " Lowe got the reaction he hoped for . Grant was incredulous , startled . " How did that happen ? How does he come to be Amos ? " " My favorite prophet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He 's an adorable prophet . Eileen is delighted . She 's reading up on Amos . " " In Hebrew , I suppose ! " said Grant bitterly . Lowe chuckled . " No . In English . I lent her books on the prophets . She 's deep in them . Of course you would n't be interested . You 're anti-Semitic . " It was a favorite accusation of Lowe 's . It annoyed Grant . " Do n't you think I might have been consulted ? " " There was no time . When the baby was born I called the American mbassy in Vienna to register his birth . They asked what his name was . said Amos Grant . Just popped into my head . As you never heard of ur son 's namesake Eileen will tell you all about him . The more she ads the more she loves Amos the elder . She 's given up Dante . She 's allout now for Jewish history . " Grant resented this also . " I know . To you she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis unusual for him . " You 're quite wrong . You could n't be more wrong . I think she 's far too good for you . " " That 's what she thinks . She turned me down , you know . And why , do you think ? On account of Stephanie ! Can you imagine ? I told herStephanie was n't the least bit interested in me . That 's not the point , ' e said . The point is that you are interested in her . ' And she sticks to t . She has a code of her own . Moreover , it 's spiky ! " " Her data may be wrong but her instinct is sound . " " Then why on earth are you urging this on me ? " " Because I 'm hoping that marriage will rid you of the adolescent nonsense you 're stuffed with . Besides which , you have an obligation to your . . . Varina ! " Lowe got up . Varina was there ; they had n't seen her approach . Varina was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've been looking everywhere for you . I 've been desperate to find you . " " What 's happened ? " " Ian . Vesper is dead . He died mysteriously in the night . They 're holding Ian . "  | " How do you know ? " Varina took a sheet of blue writing paper from her purse . " Here . Read this . From Stephanie . " Lowe took the sheet and read it . Then he read it aloud to Grant . " Darling most dreadful news . Ian is in awful trouble . I 'm going to him . Vesper died and those awful people are accusing Ian . Tell Kaetchen right away . I 'll let you know . Stephanie . " " Lovers ' quarrel probably , " said Lowe . Varina was not amused . " Do n't be flippant , Kaetchen . This is serious . This may be .. . saw Ian the other day . He scared me . " " When did you see him ? " " I drove over day before yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . I ca n't tell you exactly . He was different . His eyes were different . He 'd changed . " " Did you see Vesper ? " " No . I asked to see him . But Ian was n't seeing Vesper . " " What was he doing there then ? " " Drinking . " There was a moment 's silence . Lowe said : " Why did n't you go with Stephanie ? " " She did n't ask me . I guess . . . I guess she wanted to be the heroine , all by herself . " It was the first time , it struck Grant , that he 'd ever heard from Varina an overtone of the invidious . Varina put her hand on Lowe 's arm . " Please , Kaetchen ! Come with me to Gastein . " " I ca n't . It 's the worst possible moment for me . I can find out telephone what I 'd find out if I went . Excuse me . " He left the table . Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ?  --  " Varina made a helpless gesture . " Poor Stephanie ! And she was going to turn over a new leaf . " " What ? " " She told me she was going to give up Ian , leave all that behind  --  devote herself to her career . She told me she was never going to Ian again . "  | " But who could possibly have foretold a thing like this ! She had to . " I wish it had been me . " " Why do n't you go now ? " " I 'd be too late  --  as usual . " Lowe returned . " I spoke to the judge in Gastein . Ian was the last person seen with Vesper . They 're holding him for questioning . There are some **26;8738;TOOLONG . Nothing alarming . They 're waiting for the results of the autopsy . " Varina hid her face in her hands . Lowe went on . " He promised to call me back . Do n't worry . If necessary I 'll go with you to Gastein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't think I would . .. " Varina got up , her face averted , and left as abruptly as she had me . She had left Stephanie 's note on the table . Lowe picked it up and studied it . He folded it and put it in his pocket . The episode would make an interesting item to add to his letter to Monica . " Ghastly , is n't it ? " said Grant . " What did your friend in Gastein really say ? " Lowe did not answer . " Well , " he said . " Stephanie 's got her wish at last . She 's gotten Ian away from Vesper . " He looked at Grant . His eyes were grave . " It would have been better , " he said , " better for Varina , better for Stephanie , if it had been Vesper who survived . " All the next day , Grant underwent a crise of nervousness over the ordeal ahead of him that evening . He had been summoned , through Lowe , to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party for him and had invited some artists and writers from Vienna to share the privilege . The list , rattled off by Lowe , made his head swim . It had given him a sleepless night and destroyed his day . Among those who would be present was Ludwig Born , " a greater poet even , " according to Lowe , " than he is a novelist . " Grant had never read a word of his . To prepare him , Lowe gave Grant one of Born 's novels , in English . Read/ing it got Grant through the day . He was fascinated by it ; it was a superb novel . He would have given his soul to have been able to write novel like that but , having finished it , the terror of the evening ahead intensified . Why should a man of Born 's stature , a genuine creative force , waste his time meeting a one-shot arriviste from Xenia , Ohio ? I was grotesque . It was absurd . He felt , compared to those who were coming , ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barrage of talent . He wished he were dead . Nevertheless , at 8:30 he rang the bell at the front door of the ar bishopric . A white-jacketed butler showed him into a small reception room . He would , the butler said , inform Herr Lowe that his guest w here . It dawned on Grant that this little room was exquisitely furnish Each object had the assured look of a museum piece . There was curved , shimmering desk . Grant knew nothing whatever about styles periods of furniture nor did he care much . But he could n't fail to that this desk was a triumph of the cabinetmaker 's art ; he had nev seen such a desk . He examined it more closely . Inset in the glowi fluted panel above the desk was a small painting of a burgher in period costume . There was something familiar in the burgher 's face . Gra peered at him ; he had seen this worthy somewhere . Where ? Could it have been in some textbook he had muddled through in Professor II kins 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah ! Hochstapler . Good evening ! " " Who is this ? " " Martin Luther . " " I knew I knew him ! " said Grant in triumph . " Who painted it ? " " Cranach the Elder . It was Stohl 's idea to have it set into that desk . The desk 's not bad on its own , is it ? But the professor likes to improve on things . " Grant was reminded of the gaps in his culture . " Gosh , Kaetchen , " he moaned , " I 'm an ignorant bastard . " " That wo n't keep you from writing successful plays . " " Is Cranach famous ? " " To art lovers , yes . Personally I can do without him . " " I never heard of him till this minute . I did n't even know there two of them . " " Well , now you know . Does it make you feel better ? "  | " No use , Kaetchen . I 'm a fish out of water here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterless fish . " " Shall I tell you something ? If you promise not to tell anybody ... " " If your secret is tantalizing , I 'll make no such promise . " " I do n't know the difference between baroque and rococo . " " Your secret is safe with me . " " What the hell is the difference ? " " I 've been told many times but I never listened . But you 'll meet a an tonight who will tell you . " " Who 's that ? " " Sigmund Alt . Author of a famous book  --  The Cultural History of ' urope . " " Oh , God ! " Lowe laughed . " He 's easy . Relax . Only eight at dinner . " " And after dinner ? " " The deluge . " Grant was in despair . He groaned . " Why did I ever leave Maine ? " " On account of your great love . Remember ? " " I ca n't face it ! Please , Kaetchen , get me out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't be childish . You 're the guest of honor . People do n't chuck on Rudolph Stohl . " He walked Grant down the hall and up stairs . " I 'll show you Stohl 's library . Lady Bellamine says it 's the most beautifulroom in Europe . " " Baroque or rococo ? " " Take your choice . " " I mean to get drunk . " " Laudable ambition . Well  --  how do you like our little library ? " It was a very long room paneled in some dark shimmering wood . Around it ran a balcony with a delicately columned railing of the same dark wood . The balcony was capriciously curved ; it had shallow , randomundulations in it ; it ran around the room like a wayward stream . Behind the balustrade were the bookshelves , glassed in , the fronts crisscrossedwith slender , pale silver lattices . The light from the immense ,  |p158many-|pronged  procelain chandelier reflected on the mellow wood of the balcony railings like moonlight on dark water . " It 's adequate , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great many of these objects are props from the professor 's productions . He considers that anything that 's good enough for his productionsis good enough for his home . That chandelier , for instance . Ah ! Klaus ! Let me present the guest of honor . Young , is n't he , to be a guest of honor ? Mr. Grant  --  Klaus Wolff . " Klaus Wolff was a wispy little man , with sad eyes . " Mr. Wolff , " said Lowe , " is one of the most polished stylists in Germany . He is , alas , a drama critic .  --  But he writes so beautifully that we enjoy being assassinated . " Klaus Wolff shrank from this praise . " Please , Kaetchen ! " he begged . " Stanley is an ignorant American . If I do n't tell him , he wo n't know . " A waiter brought drinks . Grant grabbed one and gulped it . Lowe got up and walked to meet a couple who had just come in . Klaus smiled shyly at Grant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady , in an elaborately flounced evening gown of black lace , very decollete . She walked with the sweep of an empress ; she gave the effect of mowing down space . In her wake trotted a cherubic little man : a dreadnaught piloting a tug . Lowe made the introductions . They settled down to more drinks . Frau Born sized up Grant with cool appraisal ; she stared at him as if deciding whether it was worthwhile to put him on her list . But her husband was instantly likable ; his eyes twinkled behind his glasses ; he was a pet . Grant plunged in at once to tell him how captivated he had been by his novel , implying that he had known it for years and that he welcomed this chance to let his dammed-up enthusiasm overflow . " There is one scene in it , " said Grant , " that I could n't get over . It is so funny and so sad . " " Ah ! So ? " said Born . " What scene ? " " It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergraduates  --  meet at the class reunion . They 're both failures both starving . They take a walk . They 're dreaming of food ; they begin to improvise meals and then suddenly they get into a violent argumentp159about capers . One loves capers ; the other hates them . He resents the existence of capers . They part enemies . It 's just marvelous . It makes youcry . Born grinned with pleasure . " You hear , liebchen , he liked the caper scene , " he informed his wife as if she had n't heard it . Grant noticed that her cold , appraising eyes warmed . " You must come to our new home in Vienna , " she said . " Black marbleand white marble . " A tremendously tall , enormously fat man joined them , but he moved lightly . " Mr. Sigmund Alt , " said Lowe . " He will tell you what you long to now . " Alt shook hands with Grant . " Naturally , " he said , " as I am omniscient . I 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowe embarrassed Grant by saying : " Our American friend does n't know the difference between baroque and rococo . I said you might be able to tell him . " " Buy my book , " said Alt , " thereby doubling its sale . Then you 'll find out that I do n't know . Nobody knows . " Born challenged Alt , his eyes twinkling . " Ah , but you define baroque as the last craving for illusion . ' How can you venture into definition when you do n't know what you 're de-fining ? " " As no one really knows , I ca n't be contradicted . " Grant stole a look at his wristwatch . It was getting on to ten o'clock . He was famished . Did they never serve dinner in this house ? Where on earth was the host ? Born , who noticed everything , noticed this covert look . " One always waits for Stohl , " he said . As if on cue , the professor joined them . He greeted his friends , lifted Frau Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height , compactly built and had the easy manner of a king whose throne is secure . His voice , somewhat high-pitched , had an agreeable resonance . He was prentedto Grant . The professor was n't in the least professorial . Grant thought it wasp160the alivest face he had ever seen , the face of a high comedian . Stohl gave an impression of indefatigable gaiety ; his dark blue eyes were on the qui vive for laughter . Stohl greeted Grant warmly . Grant said that the mere announcement in a New York paper that he might do his play in Berlin had raised his standing on Broadway . " I like the play very much . I may even do it ! " " That would be too much . If you 'll just keep announcing it ! " Stohl laughed . So did the others . Stohl was all mobility , held in leash . He held the little circle in leash . In Born , Alt and Klaus Wolff he had a special audience and it was obvious that he had been saving a tidbit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people here I did not know . It sometimes happens  --  my good Lowe imposes it on me . This room was crowded . In a far corner there  --  under the balcony  --  I noticed a tall , distinguished man  --  elderly but elegant , extremely elegant . He was standing quite alone , drinking glass after glass of champagne . I asked several people  --  nobody knew who he was . I was curious . I decided to speak to him . From his great height he gave me a condescending look through this . " Stohl screwed up one eye and fixed in it an imaginary monocle . His face took on a vapid expression ; his features slumped bonelessly ; his shoulders bent forward ; he conveyed acutely the impression of a tall man stooping over to greet a smaller one . Grant remembered what someone had said to him once about Henry Irving when he asked whether Irving was tall : " He was tall when he wanted to be ! " From his great height Stohl peered at each of them through his monocle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did n't ask who I was  --  I doubt whether he knew . He talked about himself . He was a baron something unpronounceable in Hungarian . He told me about his youth , about his parents , about their power and money and their palaces . He had been , in his youth , very brilliant , everyone had had the highest expectationsof him . I began to be bored and was going to leave him when , suddenly , he redeemed himself . He took my arm and held me . He summarized himself with grandeur : " You know , " he said . " I was once  --  a FUTURE PRIME MINISTER ! " Stohl could n't have expected more than he got in the way of a reac/lion . Born , when he had caught his breath , said that it was the saddest biography he had ever heard . Grant managed to insert : " That 's what they 'll say about me when I 'm old . He had a play announced once by Rudolph Stohl . " Stohl took his arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frau Stohl appeared . She was tall , with ash-blonde hair , grave , stolid , the bone structure of her face so strongly marked as to seem almost skeletonized . She looked like a religieuse of peasant origin in a Diirer engraving . She mumbled an apology for having no English . Grant apologizedfor having no German . They all went in to dinner . The atmosphere of the dining room and the decoration of the table were ceremonial . Though he had never been to one , Grant thought that It must be like a state dinner . He sat at the host 's right ; Frau Stohl was at his right . The place of honor opposite Stohl was given to Frau Born . Grant hoped that the dinner would provide an interval in which he could recoup his forces . But Stohl asked him how he was spending his time in Salzburg . " He had a baby , " said Lowe . " Ah , " said Stohl , " this I know . But in the evenings ? " Grant said that he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Windsor 's frantic efforts to absorb the story of Fidelio from the eccentric narration in the program . This caught on at once . Grant embroidered . He told how he had tried himself to dredge the story from the program and given up ; how he had wished to alleviatethe duke 's suffering and just did n't know how to go about it . Stohl roared with laughter ; so did Born and the cultural historian . Even Klaus Wolff smiled a sad smile . Lowe beamed with avuncular pride ; his protege was making good in a big way ; he felt justified in his sponsorship . After Grant finished there was a buzz : there was something sadisticin their glee over the duke 's agony , from which Grant deduced that perhaps the rumors about his sympathies must be true . " It serves him right , " said Alt . " He should be condemned , the dear duke , to go to Fidelio every night . I know the litterateur of the Festspielhaus . His German is the German of Mein Kampf , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that program . I have many friends in Vienna who deserve to have it ! " Among the friends to whom Alt said he would send the scenario was an anti-Semitic colleague of his , who had , in fact , said something amusingto him the other day in the cafe they both frequented in Vienna : " Ah , you Jews , " Alt 's friend had said , " you control the press , you control the bourse and now , with Freud , you control the unconscious ! " Alt launched into a diatribe about Stohl 's neighbor to the effect that the worst sin committed by him was the corruption of the German language . Stohl put a warning finger to his lips . " Berchta , " he said , " has many ears . " Grant asked who Berchta might be . The historian explained : In Salzburg legend the residence of Stohl 's neighbor had been named after Berchta , a wicked fairy who dwelt in the crags of the Hoher Gull Mountain just above . This fairy had an unappeasable grudge against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept Berchtesgaden blanketed in thunderstorms . Stohl shook his head . He wanted Alt to keep quiet . " Does Berchta understand English too ? " " Her ears are bilingual , " said Stohl . Grant divined that talk of wicked fairies , with contemporary analogies , must not be indulged in before the waiters . Stohl undertook to give the conversation a neutral turn . He asked Grant about American novelists , playwrights and painters . Grant musteredwhat he knew . There was great curiosity about George Gershwin , who had died a few months before at the age of thirty-nine . He was mourned by these people . Alt had met him in Vienna and had heard him play the piano . It was a unique and exciting experience , he said , to hear Gershwin play . He rhapsodized about Gershwin : " And such a lovable man , so good-looking , so unaffected , modest and simple . He was an authentic genius . It is a terrible loss . There is no telling what he might have done . " Stohl was relieved that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ordeal still ahead of him , meeting the dozen or so writers and artists whom Stohl had invited for after dinner . Lowe walked him back to the library . There were about a dozen men there . He found himself , Lowe by his side , at the head of a receiving line . Lowe introduced the dozen one by one ; Grant heard a succession of names and the titles of works which the names had written : " the authorof Bambi . . . the scenarist of the film . . . the composer of the operetta . . . the librettist of . . . the poet who . . . " The names drifted by , Grant could n't seize them . The group crowded around him , asking him questions  --  about the New York theater , about Hollywood . Their eyes were hungry and thirsty , filled with wonder and longing . It was as if , simply by virtue of being American , he were omniscient and omnipotent , beyond mortality . Not only was he immortal , but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , American success . Evidently , for them , one American success was worth a whole library of European . He had noticed this here , from the beginning . Grant felt shame at being here , that he was a fraud , bogus . He felt himself unbelievably vulgar , a blatant showpiece . He felt like saying to them : " Look , my friends and colleagues , look . I have had one accidental success in the New York theater . This accident may never be repeated . I am not , as each of you is , a writer at all . I 've just manipulated , once , the trick of playwriting . I am not , as you are , distinguished . I am not educated . Until a few hours ago I 'd never heard of Cranach . I did n't even know there were two Cranachs . I have no languages . I am afraid to speak the little German I know because , if I did , it would sound dangerously like Yiddish . " But he did n't say any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the screenwriters , translated for him by Kaetchen , about who would be the most reliable agent in New York to represent his work in Hollywood . Grant offered to give this petitioner 's work to his own agent in New York . The screenwriter moved forward to wring Grant 's hand in gratitude . Grant looked appealingly at Kaetchen , who piloted him away . Stohl and his dinner guests had come back , minus the ladies . Lowe sat Grant next to Klaus Wolff , who gave him a welcoming smile . Stohl said :  | " You are lucky , my dear Mr. Grant , that Klaus does n't practice his profession in New York . You would suffer from him as he has often made me suffer . Looks innocent , does n't he ? You are quite mistaken . Vitriol . But he dispenses it in bottles so beautifully carved that I forgivehim . In fact , when he 's not criticizing , I love him . " Wolff shrank . A silence fell on the room . Grant caught his breath . Waiters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the length of the room , softly lit , cozy as the inside of a walnut shell . " Surely , " Grant thought , " the witch Berchta could n't enter this room . " Stohl 's library was an exquisite conceit of civilization , safe . The guests had settled themselves on chairs or on sofas in the islets of mellow light . Everybodywas having drinks . Everybody was at peace . It was by this time past midnight . Stohl motioned to the captain of the waiters . He apologized for keeping him and his men up so late . The captain bowed and retired . When the captain left , Stohl explained . His voice was calm , unhurried ; he had the air of giving a group of actors general instructions at the first reading of a play . " I had to caution Sigmund  --  " knows everything that goes on in this house : Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt was here this afternoon for tea . He knows it . He knows exactly when she arrived , He probably knows what our conversation was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histories and affiliations of all of you . Therefore , as well as one can , one must be careful . " Grant asked how He knew . " Because , " said Stohl with a faint smile , " almost everyone on my staff is on his staff . " Stohl said this equably , with even a suggestion of admiration for the efficiency of his neighbor . But the little speech put a spell on the room . Born said : " This morning , at the performance of Verdi 's Requiem , I saw Schuschnigg in a box . I watched him . He was listening very attentively , reverently . He did n't miss a note . " " No wonder , " said Alt , " it must have occurred to him that he was listening to his own . "  | " Yes , " said Born . " It is possible . He is a good Catholic . He looked worn . He looked desperate . " " He is desperate , " said Alt . " No matter which way he turns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . The wings of this fly will be torn off by his compatriot up there  --  Berchta 's godchild . " " I am not quite so defeatist , " said Lowe . " Schuschnigg still has cards to play . He has allies . France , England , Italy . They pledged  --  at the Stresa Conference . " Klaus Wolff looked at Lowe . It was the first time Grant had heard him say anything . " They will do nothing , " he said . " There will be a European war and the Nazis will win it . " " I do n't agree with you , " said Lowe . " I do n't agree with you at all . First , I do n't think there will be a war . He will overreach himself and he will be stopped . " " He overreached himself last year , " said Wolff softly . " In the Rhineland . Did anyone stop him ? " Lowe held his ground . " There will be no war . You will see . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You will see . " Everybody sat in silence . Through this silence came the voice of the cultural historian . His vast bulk leaned forward in his chair . He was staring at Grant . His voice  --  sharp , penetrating , a little falsetto  --  was aimed at Grant . " How do you write ? Do you use pencils ? " " No , " said Grant . " Usually with a fountain pen . Then I transcribe to the typewriter . " " I write with pencils . I love my pencils . I love to sharpen them . Long thin points . Then I lay them out before me : a long row of pencils  --  of equal length . " Grant did n't know what to say . Was the art historian drunk ? What was the matter with him ? They all listened , breathless . The historian heaved himself up from his chair . He brandished his fist at the ceiling . His voice had the effect of a scream . " If he so much as touches one of my pencils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I will jump out of the window . " He sank back in his chair , exhausted . Stohl got up , went to the serv/ing table , filled a small brandy glass and brought it to the giant , who nodded thanks and swallowed the brandy without a word . Stohl then excused himself ; he had to rehearse in the morning . By this time , Grant was so hazed with drink that the room swam before him . The others were looming apparitions , heads , hands , shoulders , gargoyle faces , grotesque , macabre . They were sitting there ! Ghosts sippingliqueurs . They would sit there eternally while the hooded angel from the flat in Xenia moved among them , hovered over them , tapping their shoulders . Behind the exquisitely carved balcony rails Grant thought he saw a white-jacketed figure lurking , peering through the rails . He knew he was n't seeing it and yet he did . They sat there . He felt like screaming at them : " Get up ! Do n't sit here ! Get out ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ought to get up himself , to flee , but he knew he would n't . He was held in a vise , powerless , like the rest of them . It was a wakeful dream , a dream in which you see disastersdescending  --  avalanches , fanged teeth , creeping , nameless forces , the clawed hand of death  --  and yet you do nothing . You know you will be eviscerated but you do nothing . These people were like effigies in a waxworks . He was himself a waxwork . He must get out into the air . He stood up . Born spoke to him . " You are going ? " " Yes , " said Grant . " I feel rather tired . I 've had a bit too much to drink . " " I 'll see you to your car . " " Thank you very much . " Grant followed Born out of the room and downstairs to the porte cochere . They waited for Grant 's car , which he had hired for the evening . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to ask of you a very great favor . " " Anything . I 'll be happy to ... " " It concerns Klaus Wolff . He is a very shy man . He does n't make an impression . But , my dear friend , I assure you , he is a beautiful writer . Very witty . He is our leading dramatic critic , but also he writes sketches and short stories . He is full of invention . " " I am sure . He 's very appealing . Sad face , has n't he ? " " He is bereft . His wife , to whom he was deeply devoted , died of cancerin Paris a few months ago . He is alone . I do n't think he can go onp167much longer in Berlin . This is what I wished to speak . If you could possibly recommend Klaus for Hollywood ? It would be a blessing and I can assure you he would not disappoint you . " " I 'll be glad to do it . I 'll do everything I can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Born took Grant 's hand and pressed it fervently . " I felt in you this kind of man . " " You may count on me . I 'd love to do it . " They made a lunch appointment . Born stood waving to him as Grant moved off in the car . He leaned back in the seat and lit a cigarette . It was heaven to feel the fresh air . A swastikaed Mercedes full of officers whizzed by . Grant 's chauffeur wafted a furtive salute , half looking round at Grant to see whether he was being observed . On his desk in his room at the castle Grant found an express letter . Ile looked at the postmark : Bad Gastein . He tore the envelope open . It was an unpunctuated letter from Stephanie . He read : Darling beloved poet Ian and I are married we wanted you to be the first to know do n't tell anyone except Kaetchen Ian adores you as much as I do we wanted you to know before anyone you will laugh when I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the police officer insisted to kiss the bride ! ! ! !

That damned promise he had made ! Would he never hear the end of it ? He opened a desk drawer to put the letter away . Lying there , in the drawer , he saw more of Stephanie 's scrawly handwriting ; the blue sheets of her welcoming letter the night he had arrived in this room . Grant went to bed . He fell asleep only to find himself again in the bewitching library at the archbishop 's palace . He was a somnambulist in a crowd of somnambulists . They were all walking blindly into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one who seemed to be aware of the pit . He screamed out a warning to the rest . But his scream was soundless . He screamed louder but he could n't make it sound . They went on walking , he with them . He kept screaming . He realized that no matter how loud he screamed nothing was audible . His desperation mounted till the cobra heads darted up to seize him .. . Next morning Liss handed Grant a cable . It was from Hollywood , offeringhim a contract to do a film . He went to the post office and sent a cable accepting . Then he went to the hospital to see Eileen . He found her reading Prophecy and the Prophets in the Old Testament , a book which Kaetchen had given her . She let go of the prophets and held him , long and close . He told her that Stephanie was married . From the hospital , Grant telephoned to Lowe . Everything was all right between him and Eileen . He asked him to find an apartment for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay until he left for Hollywood . Lowe had anticipated him : he had his eye on a nice apartment , on the Salzach , belonging to a biologist who had to go to Berlin for a time . He also had a rabbi on tap , alerted to marry him to Eileen . Lowe was as gratified as if he had just come into a handsome inheritance . Varina , drawing on her stockings in her hotel bedroom after a fitful night , reflected with detachment that her legs were very good . They were , in fact , perfect . And yet , she was forced to admit , they had done very little for her . They never would . Facing this ultimate , she gave up dressing . What , actually , was there to dress for ? A temptation that had beckoned to her often beckoned to her now , even more invitingly than it had ever done before . Why not ? She could think of no good reason why not . She stood before the full-length mirror , turned half around to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in herp169garters . Her gray eyes looked back at her from the mirror . Her chestnut hair fell down to her naked shoulders ; she contemplated the scar on her forehead . She remembered the day of the riding accident ; she had cried and cried , sure that her looks would be ruined . But it had turned out all right . Her mother had told her that the scar was piquant . " It adds something , " she had said . Even now , Varina had to agree with her mother . Yes , it did add something . But , alas , not enough . Her legs were perfect , her body was perfect , her looks were certainly not disagreeable and , yet , there was something wrong . There was something deeply wrong . What was it ? It seemed to her that she had sought an answer to this wearisome question ever since she could remember . She lit a cigarette , took a swallowof coffee from the tray the waiter had left on the table and without bothering to finish dressing , sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper-colored Salzach . The little river was undernourished ; it was so famished for water that its pebbly ribs showed . It was already very hot . The Salzburg paper , which the waiter had also left on the breakfast tray blazoned the headline : SAHARE HITZ BRENNT . What was it ? .. . Hitherto , as her failures mounted and compounded , she had hit on various theories to account for them . She now hit on a new one , a plausible one . She was a coward . She had no courage , no strength of character . She was passive . Invariably , she did the wrong thing . Yes , that was it , surely that was it . She had never before felt so clearly that she had probed to the heart of the mystery . Since she could not change , since she knew that it was not in her nature to change , since , in any case , it was too late to change , why should she go to the bother of continuing her existence ? Why should she go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chore . She could not go on endlessly performingit . She would n't . She knew how to stop . She had the means in the cabinet in her bathroom . It was not merely the news she had received from Kaetchen that Ian and Stephanie were married . It was not merely the angry letter she had received from her father summoning her to join him and her mother in London to go to the duchess 's for a shoot in Scotland . No , it was neitherof these things . Oddly enough , even more , it was Grant 's invitation to attend , next week , his wedding to Eileen . That , somehow , pinpointedp170her contempt for herself in the most vivid way . This darling , ignorant , simpleminded , impoverished girl Eileen really had courage , the courage which she herself lacked . With no prospects at all , with no hope at all , with nothing in the world between her and destitution but Sally 's kindness , Eileen had gone through with it . She had had her child . She , Varina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been as wrathful as her own . But Eileen had followed her own bent . She had the courage of her instinct . She wanted a child of Grant 's and she had it , come what may . She was n't afraid of her parents nor of anyone . It was not that Varina felt that if she 'd had Ian 's child she might have induced him to marry her instead of Stephanie . It was n't that at all . Even Stephanie was more courageous than she . She married Ian under dark circumstances . Would she have done it ? She doubted it . She would have thought : " Supposing Ian is really guilty , that he murdered Vesper ? " No , she 'd never have done it . She 'd had her chance and thrown it away . That was the thing . Had she had her child , she would have done something positive for once , given herself something to live for , a gonfalonon which to blazon her rebellion and defiance of her parents , a repositoryfor her love . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene Rosenthal . He was a banker , good-looking , rich , cultivated , patron of a chamber musicensemble , an artist manque . Of course , married , with three children . She had fallen in love with him and he with her . His wife was a delightfulcreature , a musician herself , a friend of Varina 's . Kaetchen had been her confidant in this affair . He took a poor view . " Are n't there enough unmarried men in the world ? There 's young Warburton , very eligible , who adores you . " Kaetchen had brought in young Warburton as a placebo . Warburton had very much wanted to marry Varina . Varina 's parents were delighted . Young Warburton was exactly their dish . He was the perfect antidote for Varina 's disease : a pathological preference for Jews . The trouble with young Warburton was that he was , indeed , very young . IIe would , Varina thought , even when he was middle-aged , always be " young Warburton . " He would never grow up . He was callow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps not as cowardly as Eugene , who vacillated , who was always on the verge of throwing everythingover for her , but not quite . She could have pushed him overp171the edge but she withheld . Her reason to herself that she did n't was that he must be utterly clear himself , but that was n't the real reason . She saw that now , this minute , looking out over the gravelly river gleaming dull under the blazing sun . The real reason was that she herself was afraid . There was one moment when Rosenthal had said she must go away with him ; they must do something final and spectacular , they must take the irrevocable step , confront themselves with a fait accompli . She refused . She knew that he was desperate , trying to supplementhis own timidities with a bold act , bolder than he was . She knew that he would wake up one morning reproaching himself for having abandoned his wife and children whom he adored , for having made a shambles of his life . He would miss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's parents had found out about this affair with Rosenthal . They were aghast . Their daughter , their lavishly nurtured darling , having an affair with a married man and , moreover , Jewish . This was what hurt . The first delinquency they might have overlooked . The second was unspeakable . They bundled Varina off to London , where Kaetchen introduced her to Ian Leith . Her father 's letter was on the table . She glanced at it . " I hate to tear you away from your Jewish friends but I confess that I am at the end of my patience with you . If it were not for your mother . . . " She knew it all . This time her father threatened , unless she joined them at once , to cut off her allowance . He had never threatened that before . She felt sorry for her father ; he had , she thought , missed so much in life ; he had no awareness of its true delights , the delights of art , for example . Eternal golf , eternal fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believed in . The spectacle of his country being led to the dogs by FDR made him apoplectic ; his rages were so violentthat his wife feared he would have a heart attack . He could n't have hated the traitor to his class more if he were Jewish ; in fact , he persuadedhimself that FDR was Jewish . That made it simple ; it made it possible for him to loathe the commander-in-chief of his Army and Navy with no diminution of patriotism . It legitimatized his hate . The Jews were an obsession with Mr. Lawson ; their existence roiled him . It wasp172his burning glass . Varina knew that , together with other like-minded friends , he was sending the literature of Goebbels all over the United States . Still , she was sorry for him . She also hated him . The poor man was unlucky ! Why had he been burdened with her ? Why could n't destinyhave allotted him a more suitable daughter ? Varina pondered . It was very tempting  --  the solution . It had the virtue of simplicity . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beneath the waters of the little sea . She smiled . She would n't need an allowance . The telephone rang . It was Kaetchen . In her indolent , drawling voice , she told him about her father 's letter . She brought it to the telephone and read him the sentence about dragging her away from her Jewish friends . Kaetchen chuckled . She sounded to him  --  it was her controlled intention  --  quite as usual . She did not mention that she was toying with an alternative possibility . She had done so once in London and he had talked her out of it . His advice now was crisp and authoritarian . She must comply with her father 's request at once . She must wire her father that she was leaving that afternoon on the Arlberg . He would get her reservation and pick up the ticket . The duchess he knew very well . He praised her to the skies . She was delightful , gay and humorous . As for the duke , he was unobtrusive ; he seldom left his gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself with attractive young men . There would be diversion there . Kaetchen did n't give her a chance to say anything . He would meet her at the station with the ticket , lle hung up . " Well , " said Varina to herself , " that seems to be that ! I guess I 'd better go . Passive again . True to form ! " She sat on the edge of the bed , thinking . There was still that other possibility about which , of course , she could say nothing to Kaetchen . About her only secret from him ! Had she hinted a breath of it , he would have come running . She was sorry , almost , that he had called . Still  --  for how long would she go on being cowardly ? She had only to run the tub . But Kaetchen would be buying a ticket for her on the Arlberg . She smiled . He would be stuck with the ticket . No , she could n't do that to Kaetchen . Not today . He would mourn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some other time . There would be many occa/'ions . It was a comfort to know that she had a resource . The knowledge was companionable . Slowly , Varina resumed dressing . She applied lipstick carefully in front of the mirror . She gave herself a final look , thought she passed muster . She went down to the lobby and sent a cable to her father to tell him that she was leaving that afternoon on the Arlberg . Varina was late getting to the station . Kaetchen had begun to worry that she would n't make it . He walked her down the long platform to her car on the wagon-lit . He had taken care of everything , tipped the porters , who knew him well . He had bought her flowers and magazines to while away the time on the journey . They were both quite breathless ; it was almost time for the train to move . Varina was so sorry she would have to miss the Grants ' wedding . She asked Kaetchen to give them her love ; she would cable them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all that . He , in turn , asked that his love be given to the duke and duchess . He also asked her to telephone Lady Monica in London . Varina promised . " Any messages to my father ? " said Varina , standing on the steps of the train . Kaetchen laughed . " Tell him I 'm thinking seriously of becoming a Roman Catholic . " " That 's no good , " said Varina . " He hates Catholics too ! " The train began to move slowly . Kaetchen walked along beside it . " Write me about everything . Write me about the shoot . " " Oh , naturally , the shoot . " She cupped her hands around her mouth . " Goyim nachus ! " she funneled down to him.  |p174On  the morning of his wedding day , Grant was sitting in the Biedermeieredstudy of the flat Lowe had found for him , working on his play . Schwester , wearing dark glasses , came in with a cable . He asked Schwesterhow Amos was . " He sleeps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever do anything else ? " he asked . " It is good for him to sleep , " said Schwester as she closed the do . carefully behind her . She had been instructed by Eileen that things must be kept quiet around the Master . Schwester had confided to Eileen the reason for the dark glasses . She had developed a fierce and possessive passion for the infant Amos . She felt that she had brought him  --  as indeed she had  --  from non-life to life . When Eileen asked her to come to America with them , she had promptly consented . But when she announced this plan to her occasional sweetheart , the barber , he had given her a black eye . Of this black ' eye she was ashamed and she did not want Grant to see it . It was not , she explained to Eileen , that the barber was exclusively in love with her . He had , Schwester knew  --  and it had been the cause of many quarrels and separations between them  --  many girls . It was because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a betrayal for Schwester to nurture a contaminated blood strain . Schwester 's sacrifice endeared her to Grant . At the age of five weeks , Grant reflected , Amos had already precipitated an international crisis . He created international crises simply by existing  --  like the disputed sons of royalty . No doubt about it , Amos was precocious ! Grant opened the cable . It was from Sally in Santa Barbara . It read : MY DARLING TWO KENNETH AND MARY JOIN ME IN CONGRATULATIONAND BLESSING . ALL HAPPINESS . ALL JOY . WE WILL BE WAITING FOR YOUR ARRIVAL WITH OPEN ARMS . ALL LOVE . SALLYp175Grant sat staring at the cable . He felt trembly suddenly . Somehow , the cable brought to the forefront of his mind the fact that he was actuallygetting married , that he was resigning himself to a lifetime of domesticity . The future was closed . The rampant romanticism of his fantasies , the dabs and sallies of his absurd love-probings must come to an end . But was n't that a good thing ? It certainly was a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Precisely what maturity was he did n't know . It was a much-bandied-about word but what did it mean ? Was it a synonym for renunciation and how did one know when one had achieved it ? He began to pace the room . Was It just seeing Sally 's name on the cable ? He tried to steady himself . He was now , for the first time , settled , coherent . He would devote himself to his work , to planning for Amos . Amos tugged at his heart . How gallantthis mite was to persist in living ! He slept ; he was in abeyance , gathering reserves for the struggle . Grant would oversee his education ; he would see to it that Amos 's would not be scrappy as his own had been . He would see to it that Amos did not waste himself on a shallow , literary education . The best brains now went into science ; he would see to it that Amos would be contemporary and not , as he himself was , vestigial . He was lucky to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the qualities he himself lacked : she was placid , steady , concentrated , finite . And she loved him . It was a cushion on which he could repose . He was , he told himself , happy . Perhaps that was going a bit too far . He was content . Yes , that was perhaps more exact . Was n't that better ? Better than anything . Bored with the maelstrom of his thoughts , he turned to the task in hand , to write a scene between Sally and his Dr. Ogden to follow the one he had written between Dr. Ogden and Sally 's mother . He itched with the mystery of Sally . She was Eileen 's best friend . They corresponded with each other incessantly . Hardly a day passed that he did not see a letter from Sally in the hall . He had been tempted to open one to see what on earth she and Eileen corresponded so busily about . This temptation he had , of course , resisted . He would ask Eileen what Sally had written her about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just nothing , " Eileen would say . " She just writes about how Mary is taking it being a widow , and like that . " Whenever he asked about how Sally was taking it , she clammed up . He felt a sudden angerp176against Eileen . Of course she did n't know the real reason he was so curiousabout Sally . She had known that he had been in love with Sally . Did she think that this was the reason for his curiosity ? Did she think that he was still in love with her ? Well , he would tell her that his interesthad nothing to do with what he had felt for Sally . He would tell her why he wanted to know , why he must know . He would , goddamnit , break the carapace of Eileen 's reticence about Sally . He would break it or know the reason why ! In an unanticipated fury he started out of the room . In the hall , just as she was leaving , he ran into Naomi . Naomi was the nineteen-year-old daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had brought them to the rabbi 's house to discuss arrangements for the ceremony which was to be performed in the rabbi 's apartment . Naomi had great dark eyes , pale olive skin , black hair braided in thick strands . Her hair was somewhat untidy , strands of it kept coming down on her forehead and she brushed them off with quick gestures . She was mercurial , she gave the effect , even when standing still , of darting about ; she seemed perpetually in a kind of dance and it was so with her speech , which came in little bursts . She spoke English well , with a soft accent . There was a quicksilver intelligencein her expression , in what she said , full of surprising and humorousperceptions . She reminded Grant , when he first met her , of the French lady he had met twice with Rene Wolfsohn . The latter was older , of course , but she and Naomi had the same quality of quick sympathy , of intelligence at once warm and acute . Grant had a crush on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ euphemism for an emotion he did not think it dignified to entertain . It was , he reflected ruefully , a useful cushion-word . Had he been younger and freer he could have adored Naomi . But , then , he had felt the same way about Wolfsohn 's girl , whose name he did n't even know . The two merged in his mind ; they appeared so woven in his fantasies . He had wanted to ask Eileen to inviteNaomi to their flat for a meal but Eileen had anticipated him . She also had taken to Naomi and had engaged her to teach her Jewish history . Eileen had abandoned her Dante studies in favor of Jewish history , Jewish theology , Jewish everything . She meant to study Hebrew and was shocked to find that Grant did n't know any . She meant to make up for his ignorance . Her child , after all , was named for a Hebrew prophet.  |p177She  had , therefore , to trace her infant 's genealogy , become familiar with the spiritual lineaments of his namesake . She became about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterings . Dante was left to shift for himself . Grant asked Naomi where she was running to . She was indeed running . Grant took her bare arm and held her . With her free hand Naomi fluffed back some vagrant hair . She puffed up at it with a big breath to teach it its place . She was wearing a dark blue dirndl with a white blouse . She was barelegged . Grant took in her slim brown legs . Naomi was breathless , perhaps from the ardors of explaining to Eileen about the Rechabites and to make clear to her that her Amos was not one of them . " Stay and come to the wedding with us . Kaetchen is picking us up . " " Oh , I could n't . I have to help Mother . I have to change . " " Why change ? You 're lovely in this . " " THIS ! " Naomi took the sides of her wide skirt , spread them out for a moment , then let them fall back again . " Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrified . It 's an OCCASION after all . Is it not ? I have to go ! " She was gone . Grant looked after her , half smiling , and walked back clown the hall to Eileen 's room . Eileen was n't there . He called out to her . Her voice answered from the baby 's room : " Just a minute . " Two chairs were drawn up before a big , heavy table in front of the window where , presumably , Eileen had been taking her lesson . Grant went to the table and looked at the books scattered about , books lent by Kaetchen : Sir G. A. Smith : The Twelve Prophets ( when Eileen went at a thing , Grant thought , she did n't do it by halves ) ; Prophecyand the Prophets in the Old Testament ; Harper 's Commentary ; J. E.McFayden : A Cry for Justice ( had Amos cried for justice ? ) . Some of the books were open ; in the margins he saw scribbled notes in Eileen 's eager handwriting . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in . She put her arms around him and kissed him . " Oh , darling , Amos is so wonderful ! " Grant nodded at the literature . " Which one ? "  |p178Eileen  was stymied for an instant . " Oh , I see what you mean . " She laughed . " He 's wonderful too . They 're both wonderful . But you know  --  that one , " she pointed to the books , " is so interesting ! Naomi makes him so interesting . You would n't believe , darling , what that child knows ! If we ever have a daughter , I 'd want her to be like Naomi . " " Not like Sally ? " She was startled at this . She stared at him . " What a funny thing to say ! " " Look , darling ! Once and for all you 've got to come clean with me about Sally ! " He was looking into her eyes , dead serious . Eileen was a little frightened . " Every time I ask about Sally you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read one of her letters you act as if it were a secret document . What is this fantastic reticence of yours about Sally ? " " Do we have to talk about Sally now ? Just now ? " " Yes . We do ! " " Are you still in love with Sally ? I always knew it . " " Oh , my God ! " Grant sat down , his head in his hands . Eileen went on , in a faltering voice . " You know everything I have  --  everything I am  --  everything Iknow  --  I owe to Sally . Even  --  even you  --  I owe to Sally . " " You ca n't go on all your life being grateful . You ca n't make a c. reer of gratitude . It 's servile . " He got up , took her in his arms . She was , he saw , on the verge tears . " Darling , it 's my fault . My fault really . Because I 've never told ys why I keep asking about Sally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fore I 've finished it . It 's a kind of superstition . I 've been secretive Just as secretive as you 've been . You think  --  my constant proddin about Sally  --  you think it 's idle curiosity , morbid , gossip-mongering. is n't . I really have to know . It 's important for me to know . " " Why ? " " Because I 'm writing about her , that 's why . " She stared at him , incredulous , horrified.  | " That 's what my play is about . It 's about Sally  --  about Ogden and Ily 's mother . " Eileen continued to stare , as if it were an enormity too great to take in . " Well , " he said , " what 's wrong with it ? " His voice rose . " Why do you look like that ? Is it , perhaps , a forbidden subject ? " " Please , Stanley , please do n't . " This was something new ! Censorship ! Censorship at home ! He did n't trust himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling ! Please ! You have so many ideas . You 're so creative ! Please , darling , write something else ! " Grant saw red . His hand reached for one of the books on the table . He felt like throwing a prophet at Eileen . He knew that if he stayed in the room another second , he would hit her . He walked out quickly and banged the door behind him . An hour later , Kaetchen picked them up in a hired car to drive them to the wedding . He saw at once that something was wrong ; Eileen was pale ; it was obvious that she had been crying . Grant was smouldering . " Write something else . " How could he be marrying a woman capable saying that ? Kaetchen took the tension between bride and groom inhis stride , quiet and cajoling . " Why did you have to pick just this morning to quarrel ? " he said , resting back comfortably between Grant and Eileen . " Why did n't you wait till you are safely married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them smiled . Grant held on tightly to his grievance ; that little query of Eileen 's was branded in his psyche . Kaetchen , not a bit discouraged by the heavy silence , went on unperterbed . " I have news for you of another marriage . Stephanie and Ian . Yes , I 'm just back from Gastein . Well , this sensational announcement does n't seem to have created the impression I expected . But does n't it reasureyou ? If those two could get married , why not you two ? Compared to them you are a normal couple . It was very amusing . Stephanie is exalted . You know her stage ambition has always been to play Jeanne d'Arc . Now , in Gastein , she 's playing Jeanne . She feels heroic . She married a man under lock and key , held for a grave charge . And , do youp180know , it 's having an effect . It may save Ian . They think , these snobbis police , if this lady , a von , with such a distinguished ancestry , marri. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noble lady would n't mar an accused man if there were even a possibility of his being guilty ! Th just do n't know Stephanie ! No doubt it will save Ian . Do n't you thi it 's amusing ? " If Eileen and Grant thought it amusing they gave no sign . They had arrived at their destination in one of the narrow , mediev streets of Salzburg . Eileen , without moving , found speech at last . Her voice was dry . " Kaetchen ! Tell Stanley he does n't have to go through with it . It not too late . We can turn back right now ! " " I have no intention , " said Kaetchen , as if Grant were somewh else , " of transmitting an absurd offer like that . You will have to fi yourself another emissary . " Eileen then spoke directly to Grant . " You do n't have to , darling ! I mean it . You do n't have to ! Ka . chen . Ask the driver to take us back . " Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the door open f Eileen and Kaetchen to follow him . Naomi and her parents received them . Naomi had changed into dark , flowered dress . She wore black pumps and stockings . She made an effort to look dignified but she still gave the impression wanting to dance , possibly back into her dirndl . Her parents were a li putian couple , exactly the same height , a pair of elderly marionett perfectly matched . The rabbi wore a modest black beard ; he was vo tile and humorous ; Grant could see from whom Naomi had inheri her mercurial quality . Her mother was rotund , spoke not a word English , smiled and nodded no matter what was said and conveyed impression of general amiability . A velvet canopy had been set up in corner of the small living room . In the dining room beyond the table set for tea and cakes . The flat was rather dark but shining with tidinNaomi and Eileen embraced . Eileen essayed a little joke about having seen Naomi for such a long time . The rabbi treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier visit a differencep181tween the rabbi 's reaction to him and that of the German writers he had . These were deferential ( sometimes with an overtone of contempt ) ause of his glittering , pecuniary American success . But the rabbi 's attildeamused and even touched him . Simply by virtue of being a %chriftsteller , a playwright , the rabbi regarded him as a spiritual Irader . " As you are a Schriftsteller , " the rabbi had said on Grant 's earliervisit , " you are yourself a prophet . And you know , " he had remindedGrant with a smile , " that is a Jewish specialty  --  prophecy ! " The rabbi looked forward to seeing Grant 's play when Stohl produced It in Germany . Grant thought of his play , a sex-comedy , and he hoped devoutly the rabbi would never see it . If he did , Grant was sure , the rabbi would be less inclined to rank him among the prophets . " Shall we talk a little ? " the rabbi asked . " Or , " he smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's talk a little , " said Eileen , who was fighting for composure . They all sat down . " I suppose you know , " Kaetchen said to Eileen , " that your son can ever be President of the United States . " " Why not ? " demanded Naomi . " Because he was born in Salzburg . That 's the law in America . To be President you have to be born there . " " I think it 's a very silly law , " said Naomi . " I wish there were such a law in Germany ! " said the rabbi with a ry smile . There was a moment 's silence . " Maybe , " said Eileen , " by the time Amos is grown up , they 'll have changed the law . " " It 's very unlikely , " said Kaetchen . " But do n't worry about it . here are so many better-paying jobs in America . " " By the way , " said Grant , addressing Kaetchen , " as long as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name him after a minor prophet ? Why did n't you name him after a major one  --  Isaiah , say , or Jere-tniah ? " The rabbi took issue with this . " Oh , but Mr. Grant , excuse me ! There are no major prophets nor inor ones . This is a matter of reputation . Prophecy is a gift , a quality , vision . And in this , Amos has no peer . In purity . In purity of vision . e was , you know , the earliest of the prophets. "  | " What did he stand for ? " asked Eileen , who liked things in Categories . " Social righteousness . He was a herdsman , a gatherer of sycamore fruit . He was modest . He told the Lord that he had no gift for proph. ecy , that he was a simple farmer . But the Lord overcame his scruple . The Lord insisted . " " The Lord 's confidence was justified then ? " said Grant . The rabbi looked at him and smiled . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord had reason to be proud of him . " It was obvious that the rabbi was proud too . He talked about the prophet with affectionate intimacy as of a favorite uncle . " There is a lovely remark of his , " the rabbi went on , " which is , think , fitting for this occasion . " Eileen leaned forward eagerly . " What is it , Rabbi ? " " Can two walk together , except they be agreed ? ' " Eileen 's eyes filled with tears . " That 's beautiful , " she said . " Stanley , is n't that beautiful ? " " Yes , " said Grant . " It is . " " Well , " said the rabbi , " perhaps we 'd better begin . " He smiled them . " I have to put on my official costume for the occasion . " He got up and went into another room . Grant looked at Eileen . Her eyes were wet . His abrasive thought . about her softened . She was very good , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . They sat holding hands . " Write something elsWell , it was a clumsy remark . But how could Eileen be expected know what his play meant to him , how he was agonizing over it , tough it was ? To her writing was a kind of hobby . Subjects could picked up at random , like choosing a fruit or a breakfast food from array in a supermarket . And she was absorbed in higher things . Dan Jewish history . Was Eileen a highbrow ? A wicked definition of the hi brow passed through his mind . In loyalty to Eileen he rejected it. it that she was humorless ? Poor Eileen ! He felt sorry for anyone had no humor ; they were blinded in some way . Well , he would supply for both of them . He began to feel protective about Eileen . He we shield her , even from the animadversions of his own inner voice . He looked at Naomi . She was looking at him . She smiled at him ,  |p183If  to give him courage . He kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world a more beguiling creature than Naomi ! In that bright face were intelligence , quick humor , awareness . Inescapably , the face of Rene Wolfsohn 's French friend merged with Naomi 's : they were the same , they were sisters in beauty , in understanding , in shimmering vitality . Should he , at this moment , be marrying , not Eileen , but , and/or Naomi-the-French-girl ? The rabbi returned wearing a white silk skullcap and an enveloping prayer shawl of silk with gold tassels . Everybody stood up . The rabbi draped around Grant 's shoulders a lesser shawl , like a scarf , and gave him a black skullcap to put on . They ranged themselves under the canopy , Grant and Eileen on either side of the rabbi . The rabbi opened his prayer book . " The service I am going to read you , " he said , " is in Hebrew . The ords you will hear are five thousand years old . For five thousand years ey have been spoken to unite in marriage the generations of your ancestors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grant noticed that the lips of the rabbi 's wife moved as her husband intoned . She had heard these words so many times . She knew them by heart . Grant remembered the books of the blocked Hebrew words he had studied when he was a childXenia . His father would have known what the rabbi was saying . hen his father had been married in Memel  --  " blistered in Memel "  --  e had understood these words . Still , the rhythm , the cadence , the faint tntillation revived early memories : restive hours in the Xenia synagogueon the Day of Atonement , his father pacing his room at night yoking protection against the Dark Angel . He had been cradled in is language and yet he could n't understand a word of it . But the sound , the resonance , the cut the words made in the silence , were eeply evocative . What could they mean to Eileen ? Her ancestors had . en married in Latin . He stole a look at her . No , she was all attenion , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it were from her abandoned God , Dante . The rabbi brought Grant a glass tumbler wrapped in a napkin . He explained : he must crush the glass with his heel , to symbolize the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans . Grant couldn'tp184help thinking that the rite was grotesquely antiquarian . Contemporary structures were in danger ; they were surrounded by an enemy more vindictivethan the Romans . He had been reading about synagogues and graveyards vandalized in Germany . A tidal wave was moving toward them and no one to put a finger in the dike . He felt again the terror he had experienced in Stohl 's library . But he did as he was told . He crushed . And then it was over . He embraced Eileen and whispered " I love you " into her ear . Everybody kissed everybody . He found himself kissingNaomi . He held her close . He felt sudden fear for her . What would happen to this enchanting creature under the shadow of the aerie ? How could he leave her , unprotected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked her father to let her go to America with them , where she would be safe ? How delicious it would be to travel with Naomi , to show her the wonders of the USA ! They were all marshaled into the dining room for tea , wine and cakes , The rabbi , divested of his accoutrements , toasted the bride and groom . They toasted each other . Grant got a laugh by his little , speech to Kaetchen . In this instance , he said , the Shadchen de Luxe had lowered him social standards . There was warmth and gaiety in the little dining room . They toasted peace on earth and good will to men . They wished happi ness for each other and for everybody else . Jocularly , Grant proposed to Naomi 's parents the wish he had felt a few minutes before , when he held Naomi in his arms , that they let him take her to Hollywood , where he would arrange to get her a screen test . There was a mania for Bibli- cal pictures . Naomi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pla Ruth . Kaetchen explained the proposal to the rabbi 's wife in GermaShe laughed , nodded hearty agreement to the plan . The party broke up . The Grants were leaving the next day . The rah thanked Grant for his generous gift to the Gemeinde , for the poor Salzburg . They looked forward to reunion . Naomi said Amos m come , when he was grown , to visit his birthplace . This wish Amos 's fa- ther fervently echoed . He held Naomi 's hand in farewell . He knew that he would never see her again . In the car on the way back , Kaetchen broke the silence . " Well , " he said , " are you happy , at least ? " Grant smiled but did n't say anything . By way of answer Ell.  |p185moved  a bit closer to her husband . Her face was flushed , her eyes misted . Grant thought she looked beautiful . He had never seen her look like that . They arrived at the Grants ' apartment house and said good-bye on the sidewalk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unable to go to the station tomorrow to see them off . Grant had taken a house in Beverly Hills . They insisted he come and stay with them . He promised . Eileen kissed him : " Good-bye , dearest Kaetchen . Thank you for everything . " Schwester opened the door of their flat for them , bobbed and congratulatedthem . Amos had given her no trouble at all , she reported . They went at once into the baby 's room . Amos was in foetal position ; on his knees with his head buried in the pillow , fast asleep . Grant wondered how he breathed . They stood in silence , looking at him . Eileen 's hand passed over the light fuzz on the infant 's head without touching it . Grant looked at her . He saw in her eyes the same look he had seen in the hospital , when the minor prophet had been transparent . Thank God , he was no longer transparent ! Grant put his arm around Eileen 's shoulder . She looked at him , the same look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding each other close . This , after all , Grant thought , is all that matters . The rest , the absurd dalliances of his imagination , were unspeakably trivial . This was the thing . This was all . Eileen 's eyes , shining with love , were on his . Not to wake Amos , she whispered in his ear : " God bless the three of us . " Grant had taken two adjoining compartments on the Arlberg Express to Paris , one for Schwester and the baby , one for himself and Eileen . Eileen was in Amos 's compartment now , in conference with Schwester . Grant sat at the glass-topped shelf table in his cubicle . He had cleared off the travel folders and resort advertisements and substituted his note/book . He was on his third Scotch and soda . The rhythm of the train was lulling ; he stared out of the window in a half doze . The landscape was mountainous and very pretty : multicolored , cozy chalets nestling confidingly under clumps of trees ; long , narrow bridal-veil green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crystal . line ice-iridescence that spumed from the waterfalls seemed to Grant effluvial ; it gave off a double glitter that was menacing , mephitic . This picture-book prettiness reminded him for some reason of Schwester 's erstwhile boyfriend the barber . That barber epitomized this country to him ; he hated it ; he was happy to be leaving it . Its beguilements were mantraps . He thought of the nightmarish evening in Stohl 's library Were they sitting there still ? What were they waiting for ? To be noosby these wire-thin waterfalls ? Grant knew he was drunk . He poured himself another Scotch  --  the last , he told himself  --  with an illogical conviction that it would sober him up . He tried to reconstruct the two months that had elapsed since he had boarded this train in Paris . Could he have known , could he have fore . seen , that he would return on it a married man , a father ? Had such as inconceivable fantasy occurred to him then , the bride would have bStephanie . But this emotion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actuality . It was as impossible to bring it back as the p. of a headache or a toothache of a year ago . You remembered it the wa you remembered a historical date , a fact , a dead fact . You could rememberattendant circumstances  --  Stephanie saying matter-of-factly : " Was it all right ? " She had said it , that was a dead fact . Even the shame he had felt was gone ; he remembered it as you might remember a misadventure you had been told about that had happened to somebody else . The present moment even  --  was it capturable ? It was n't , not really . He was waiting . He was waiting for something to happen , for some ma ment , some reality he could capture , that would revivify him , that he could experience . Just now he was marking time . The seconds , the min  --  utes , passed him by like the trees and the houses and the waterfalls out . side the window . In the next room was a stranger to whom he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was mysterious . She had some IDEAL in her head and the realization of this appeared to be the essence of her earnp187istence . He thought of her enthusiasms since he had known her . First it was Greek mythology , then Dante and now , believe it or not , it was Jewish theology , the Hebrew ethic . Her mind was a lazy Susan which accepted what was put on it . Eileen had had a strict Catholic upbringing ; was she really a religieuse ? That was it , Grant thought . She should have been a nun . Too bad the Jews did n't have convents , she might have become a Jewish Mother Superior . Grant had to smile . He had explained to Eileen that she must say nothing to anybody in Hollywood about the fact that he was working on a play . He had explained to her that his contract required him to work for the film company exclusively . Eileen had been shocked by this . This was not , she had protested , ethical . It was not honest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his contract with the studio had terminated ? Grant had temporized . It was a white lie , he said ; everybody in Hollywood did it . But for Eileen there were no white lies . There were just lies . " I have evidently , " he had said to her , " married the Recording Angel . " She had kissed him , as if he had paid her a compliment . To save acrimonious discussion he had also told her that he had dropped the play about Sally and her mother and Ogden and was working on a new idea that had hit him . For this renunciation she had been grateful . She loved him for that . She would never forget it . It occurred to Grant that Eileen loved him in a vacuum . She lived for abstractions in a cloud of abstractions . She admired him and was proud of him for being a writer , but what kind of writer he was or was trying to be she had no notion of , nor was she curious . Large concepts beckoned her , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between black and white but to the merging colorations of the spectrum she was impervious . She was color-blind . How easily she had believed he had given up one play and switched to another . All he 'd had to do , evidently , was to amble from the avocado counter to the grapefruit counter in the market . How could she be made to realize the importance of this play to him , that a playwright 's second play was more important to him than the first ? Did he have staying power or was he a one-shot ? At twentynineGrant lived in terror of declension . Still he felt a rush of tender feeling for Eileen . She was really so dear  --  and quite funny , although he would n't have wanted anyone elsep188to laugh at her ; he would have resented that . She was a child , who had been accosted in the dark by the ogre of culture ; she had been raped by culture . It was , moreover , his doing . He had been the rapist of that virginal mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those highbrow books  --  Frazer and Burckhardt  --  and she had plowed through them in a touching effort to levitate herself to the plateau which she mistakenly supposed him to inhabit . Most of the books he 'd sent her he had n't read himself ; he knew what they stood for and how the contributions they had made were regarded but that was about all ; in the milieu in which he moved people read little more than current novels . How could he possibly expect her to understand these things , or the subtle and maddening problems presented by his work and the fierce competitiveness of his metier ? It was unreasonable . He would have to teach her . It would be amusing , would n't it , to teach her , to indoctrinate her in the actualities of life , with its halftones and compromisesand complexities ? He would have to do it , he saw , slowly , gradually . He would have to be patient . But what fun ! To transmute the nun into a woman of the world , to show her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiate her into the twilight zone of compromise . He had to teach her not to probe the motives of conduct too deeply , not to hunt them out of their lairs into the light of day . He had to undo a fixed code . He looked at his notebook . He found himself confronted with the eternal query : " Sally ? Motive ? Define Sally . Get Sally . " He leaned back against the compartment wall , passing his hand over his face as if dry-washing it . That Sally ! The enigma of Sally ! The most desirable girl in the world , surely . Thinking back on the summer he met her he began to feel resentment . She had used him . She had fobbed off Eileen on him in order to get the leisure and the privacy to . . . Of course ! How stupid he had been not to see it before . So simple , so clear , so all-embracing , so obvious . The invisibility of the obvious  --  that 's why he had n't seen it before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The illumination he hadjust been blinded by revealed everything  --  not only for his play but the mystery of Eileen 's secretiveness . Of course ! Of course ! What he saw was that Eileen had been Sally 's go-between , her coconspirator , her accomplice . Did n't that clear up everything ? No won/der she would n't talk about Sally . She was ashamed of what she had done , must keep it secret at all costs . She had been the intermediary between Sally and Ogden . No wonder she had been upset when Grant told her he was writing a play about this unsavory collusion . No wondershe had begged him to give it up . No wonder she had said : " Write something else . " No wonder she had been so relieved and almost tearfullygrateful when he had told her he was giving up the play . Well , he would n't give it up . He was , in fact , now able to finish it . Another dimension . Another character . Eileen ! Yes , he would introduce Eileen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never recognize herself ; he would make the go-between much older , a spinster schoolteacher who had made a pet of Sally . And what if she did recognize herself ! Serve her damn well right ! He resented them both  --  Eileen and Sally . He had served as a cover for them beneath which Ogden and Sally could carry on their unholy affair . " Is it ethical ? " That was what Eileen had asked him when he told her that he was going to write his play on studiotime . Well , was what she had done ethical ? She was not so noble then , Eileen . Not by half . She was Mrs. Tartuffe ! Grant was bent over his notebook , giving vent , in a burst of creative fury , to his newly found grievance against Sally and against Eileen . Mrs. Tartuffe , blissfully unaware , pushed the door open , came to him , put her arms around him and kissed him . She was radiant with happiness , fragrant . " Come and say good night to Amos , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful mood . Come in and see . Have you been working well , darling ? Come ! " Somewhat unsteadily , Grant got up and followed Eileen into the corridor and into the next compartment . The berths were made up ; Amos was bedded in the lower one . Schwester was sitting beside him bent over him . Amos was exploring her face with his fingers . " Here 's Daddy come to say good night to you , " said Eileen . Amos stared at Grant wonderingly . His eyes were large and blue . " He has blue eyes , " said Grant . " Where does he get those from ? " " They will change , " said Schwester . Schwester got up from the berth to make room for Grant . Grant sat beside his son . " How does she know they will change ? "  | " She knows . They 're often blue in the beginning . " Amos continued to stare at his father . It was a look neither hostile norfriendly , simple query . He began to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he likes my looks , " said Grant . " Well , neither do I ! " Eileen laughed . " He 's just getting acquainted . After all , he has n't seen much of you , has he ? Schwester and I have monopolized him , have n't we ? " She smiled at Schwester . " Shall we give Mr. Grant more time with him , Schwester ? Does he deserve it , do you think ? " " Why not ? " said Schwester . Amos continued his unblinking stare . He made a face which looked like a smile . Eileen was delighted . " Is he laughing with me or at me ? " Grant inquired . " He knows you 're funny , " said Eileen . " He knows you write come . dies . " " That 's more than I know , " said Grant . Outside in the corridor , the dinner bell rang for the first sitting in the dining car . " We must go in to dinner , darling . " " What about Schwester ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eileen out of the compartment . They shook the selves down the lurching corridor to the restaurant car . Once seat . Grant ordered a Scotch and soda . The waiter brought a tray of hors d'oeuvres but Grant did n't take any . " Do take some , darling . They 're delicious . " " This 'll do me . It 's nourishing . " " You seem to drink an awful lot . You used n't to , did you ? In Blue Hill , even in New York , I do n't remember that you drank much . " " I 'm celebrating . " " What ? " " A discovery . " " What about ? " " If you want me to tell you , I 'll tell you . You wo n't enjoy it much . She looked at him , startled  | " Are you angry about something ? Have I done anything ? " " I am angry at myself . At my stupidity . " " Tell me what I 've done . " " It was silly of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To keep dunning you  --  about Sally , about Ogden . It was stupid of me  --  when the truth is so obvious . " " But you 've given up this play . " " I have not . On the contrary  --  I now see my way clear to finish it . " " But you told me you 'd given it up . " " I lied . I never had any intention of giving it up . " " Why ? Why did you lie ? " " To spare ourselves nasty scenes , such as we had on our wedding morning . " " But you did n't have to lie . You could have told me . You 're the masterof your own life , are n't you ? You can do what you like . Why do you have to lie  --  in order to do what you like ? " " There are many varieties of lying . One way is by keeping quiet  --  in order to conceal a lie . " Eileen stopped eating . There were tears in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a certain vindictiveness . " It 's an easy way to get the last word  --  by crying . " " It just seems terrible to me  --  to start our marriage with a lie . " Grant was irritated . " There is also  --  as I just pointed out  --  the lie of silence . " " I do n't know what you mean . " " Working in there just now , I saw the whole thing . You were the gobetween  --  in Maine and in Cleveland  --  between Sally and Dr. Ogden . Sally 's mother engaged you , did n't she , to be Sally 's companion ? You betrayed poor Mrs. Frobisher . Is that honest ? To use your own favorite word  --  is that ethical ? " She brushed her eyes . She gave him a clear look , as if she were seeinghim for the first time . He met her gaze truculently . While he was looking at her he knew , utterly , that the theory he had concocted was false . Then why did n't she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him crazy . He heard himself saying the opposite of what he knew to be true . " Your silence  --  your avoiding it  --  only proves that what I am accusingyou of is true . "  |p192He  was bitterly disappointed . He had wanted his accusation to be true , to have a justifiable grievance . " If we are going to lie to each other  --  if we are going to evade each other with lies  --  then there is no use  --  is there really  --  any use . . . ? " She broke off . She tried to make a show of eating . She gave it up . " If that 's the way it 's going to be  --  it 's a flop then , is n't it  --  our marriage ? " She looked at him again . Her eyes were tragic , contemplating the ruins . He felt pity for her ; he was moved by her . At the same time he resented her for toppling his theory , for extinguishing his illumination and , moreover , without a word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are totally unrealistic . You have n't an inkling about the facts of life . " " It 's what the rabbi said  --  it 's what your own prophet said ... " " I do n't feel possessive about our prophets ! " " Do n't you remember ? He said , the prophet Amos said : Can two walk together , except they be agreed ? ' " " I 'm not religious , darling . " " You believe in God , do n't you ? " " Not in the least . The very mention of the word revolts me . By your own standard  --  God is extremely unethical . " The vehemence of his blasphemy terrified her . She looked at him , frightened . She clung to a spar . " You do n't mean that . You 've been drinking . Otherwise you would n't . . " Drinking has nothing to do with it . I tell you , darling , you 're un . realistic . You wo n't face facts . " The dinner bell rang for the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartment with his notebook Grant was convinced that Eileen had not been an accomplice between Sally and Ogden . But what difference did that make as far as his play was concerned ? He was a creator , was n't he ? He would create his own facts . They would be . come facts simply by virtue of his having stated them in his fiction The theory he had evolved made sense . He could make an audience 1 . lieve it . Life might be senseless but a play must n't be . He went on scri bling until , through the partition , he heard that Schwester had co back . He undressed and got into his pajamas . He poured himself and  |p193other  drink and lay down on the made-up lower berth waiting for Eileen . He remodeled his grievance against her , building it up , nursing it . She was stubborn , mulishly stubborn . He would pulverize that stubbornness . He had never been up against anyone like her . He had thought he understood her ; he had n't in the least . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had pigeonholed her . She was , it turned out , full of ambiguities ; her loyalty was divided , between himselfand some absurd and chimerical ideal she waved about like a bantier . She was a fanatic for First Principles . She had no seconds , no thirds . She was a primitive . It was extraordinary  --  her behavior at dinner . She had n't even bothered to deny his allegation against her . All she clung to was the fact that he had lied . How deftly she had converted him , the plaintiff , into the accused ! She was , beyond words , tactless . " Write something else . " Tactlessness certainly could n't go beyond that . As his grievance against her mounted , so did his desire for her . What the devil was she doing inside there anyway ? Schwester was back , the baby was all right , what was holding her up , why the devil did n't she come in ? She was stubborn , all right ; he would break that stubbornness . Ile was infuriated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapped on the wall of the compartment . The noise of the train , he realized , blanketed that out . He had never before so wanted her ; she had become acridly desirable to him . He would break that stubbornness . Eileen came in and began methodically to fit the chain lock into its slot . He got up and seized her . " Just let me finish this . " He did n't let her finish it . As she submitted to him she laughed  --  an infuriating little laugh . The little laugh said : " Why so ferocious  --  when you have nothing to conquer ? " But he did have something to conquer . He knew that if he did n't , her existence would be a threat to his own . The next afternoon , in Paris , the Grants and Schwester boarded the boat train for Le Havre to catch the Normandie . " No verandah this time , " Grant thought grimly when he saw the proud majesty of the liner looming up over the pier . As they walked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newsstand . He took in the cover.  |p194Later  edition ; same theme . Mr. Streicher had , evidently , only one string to his bow . He kept twanging it . It was a female this time  --  a whorehousemadame  --  luring guileless Aryans into her lair . She was so repulsiveshe could n't have done much business , Grant thought . Suddenly he remembered Naomi , slim , spritelike , Ariel in The Tempest . He felt a throb of anxiety for Naomi . He should have taken her away . Grant did n't buy Der Sturmer this time , but he saw that several of his fellow passengers did . For boat-deck reading , he imagined.  |p197No  sooner were the Grants and Schwester settled in their SpanishGothicvilla on Coldwater Canyon in Beverly Hills than Eileen received word that her mother was gravely ill in Cleveland . Grant made a halfheartedoffer to accompany her , but Eileen would n't hear of it . He must stay so that he could report to her on Amos . She trusted Schwester but it would reassure her more than anything to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to report to the studio . She would n't even let him drive her to the airport . Sally would do that . Sally had left Santa Barbara and was in town at the Beverly Wilshire . He must be nice to Sally . He must take her to dinner and introduce her to his glamorous friends in the film colony . She left , promising to telephonefrom Cleveland . Grant did as he was told . He telephoned Sally and invited her to dinner that night at Romanoff 's . At eight o'clock , in considerable excitement , Grant passed through the great doors of Mike Romanoff 's restaurant , the meetingplace of the Hollywood elite . The massive and portentous front door was flanked by Imperial seals , embossed in bronze : truculent eagles , spouting sheaves of crossed spears , topped by the jewel-infested Czarist crown . It was Mike Romanoff 's little tribute to his lost relatives . He found Sally waiting for him in the colonnaded circular lobby . She greeted him with cool warmth . At the same moment , the proprietor himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike was diminutive , jaunty , impeccablydressed . He spoke approximate English in a gravelly bass . For a member of a dour and taciturn family , he was remarkably jolly . Grant told Mike that on a barge on a Salzburg lake , he had sat next to his aunt , the Grand Duchess Marie . He included Sally in this reminiscence . Sally nodded , yes , she remembered very well . But Mike did not respondwith any family feeling . Perhaps he did n't like his aunt . Or perhapsshe had just missed being his aunt.  |p198The  headwaiter , a pal of Grant 's , showed them to their table . Grant felt happy . He was on home ground . For once , he felt free and easy with Sally ; he chattered in his most amusing vein . But he had the feeling , which he always got from Sally , that she was thinking of something else . Fortunately , at that moment Hugo Stift came up to say hello to Grant . This was a windfall . Grant was delighted ; he adored Stift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood and Sally must be impressed at the warmth of his greeting . He introduced Sally and insisted that he sit with them for a minute . Grant drew up a chair for him . Stift sat by Sally . Stift was little , Sally was tall . He beamed up approvingly at her . He sized her up at once : a " society girl . " Stift was swarthy ; he had smooth , jet black hair , slicked down over his forehead , and great brown eyes , warm and lively . He smoked a huge cigar and spoke with a heavy German accent . His is rolled out like heavy artillery . He took Sally in , more and more approving . He was used to taking girls in , imagining how they would look on the screen . " You live here ? " " No , " said Sally . " Just a visitor . " " You come to make a screen test ? " " Not at all . " Stift was delighted at the surprising absence in Sally of ambition . " Torrific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photogenique and do n't want a screen test ! Torrific ! " " Miss Frobisher , " Grant explained , " is a civilian . " " So ? " Stift edged his chair up a little closer to Sally 's . He smiled up at her ; Sally smiled back . " You 're relieved , are n't you ? " she said . " It must be tiresome for you  --  all those girls wanting screen tests . " " I would like , " he said roguishly , " to have a severre friendship wiz you . " Sally was amused . " I 'd love it , " she said . " The severer the better ! " Stift took his cigar out of his mouth . He spoke to Grant as if Sally were n't there . " But she 's nice ! " he said , as if that were too much for anyone to expect . " She is vorry nice ! "  |p199Grant  took the compliment graciously . " Do you think I 'd waste your time on a girl who was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He explained to Sally : " Mr. Stift has a beautiful house in Brentwood . " For a moment Stift 's eyes went into mourning . " Ah , but Stanley , you do n't hear ? This lovely house is no longer with me . You do n't hear ? " Grant explained that he 'd been in Europe . " No more . It is now with Sandra . I am now back in Beverly Wil-shire . " As he sensed a routine forming , his eyes went out of mourning . " You know how it is here  --  vot happens . You come to Hollywood . You stay Beverly Wilshire . You fall in love . Vonderrful ! You marry . You build beautiful house . Vonderrful ! Then  --  it all goes , the vonderrful . Divorce . Wife , natural , gets the house . You go back Beverly Wilshire . So now I am in Beverly Wilshire . " " So is Sally . " " Vonderrful ! In Europe , Stanley , where you were ? " " Salzburg . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You saw then Rudolph Stohl ? " " I certainly did . He gave a party for me . " " So ? And how is he ? You and Stohl  --  that is good . You got on well together , no ? " " He 's irresistible . Enormous charm . " " Ah ! Charm . In this he has monopoly . Also , he is genius . He starrted me . I was actor in his company in Berlin . " " Were you ? I did n't know that . " " All of us here from Germany he starrted . " Stift now edged his chair closer to Grant . " For Stohl I am starrting here conspiracy . I want your help , Stanley . Vorry much . " " What sort of conspiracy ? " " I do n't like how things look over there . Bad ! Vorry bad ! Not too long Stohl 's theaters in Berlin will be confiscate . Kaput ! Before it happensI vant he should come here . Make here a film . I spoke to Lichtman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vorrld . He isp200amusing man , sometimes , Lichtman . Hugo , ' he say to me , business is so big even the good pictures make money . ' So I say to him why you do n't bring here Rudolph Stohl ? He makes you good picture , great picture . Vot you think , Stanley , it would be vonderrful , no ? " " It certainly would be . What did Lichtman say ? " " Hugo , ' he say , you are a vorry dangerous man . ' But he listened . I think I made impression . " " Of course , I 'll help you any way I can . " " He thinks vorry high of you , Lichtman . Together , we make propagandato bring Stohl here . Yes ? " Grant stole a look at Sally . Was she impressed that Lichtman thought highly of him ? He thought he 'd better explain . " Mr. Lichtman , " he said to Sally , " is a big tycoon here , one of the biggest . " Sally absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sally , " that we talk shop . " " I love conspiracies , " said Sally . Grant questioned Stift . " What could Stohl do here ? " Stift made a gesture embracing the universe . " Anything ! Anything in the vorrld . Shakespeare ! Why not Shakespeare ? After all , he is playwright too . So many millions they make why not invest , for vunce , in Shakespeare ? They should let Stohl make what he has already made so marvelous in Europe . Midsummer Night 's Dream . Why not ? Danton 's Tod . Why not ? It could shine out , light up entirre industry . Perhaps , even , it transforms industry . Possible ? No ? Overnight , industry becomes art . They have it both ways . " Stift 's enthusiasm was contagious . Grant caught it . " It would be marvelous . I 'll do everything I can . Will Stohl come , do you think ? " " Soon he will have no choice . These Gerrmans . . . " Stift 's expression darkened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Grant . " I felt it when I was there . But they do n't seem to feel it , Stohl and the rest . Somehow , they think things will get better . " Stift shook his head.  | " They are mistaken . They will not get better . They will get vorrse . But people believe what they vant believe . " For a moment Stift was silent . Then his eyes brightened . He turned to Sally . " I remember , Miss Sally , as an example of this , how people insist to believe what they vant . During First World War I am comedian in musicalcomedy in Berlin . We have great patriotic second act curtain . I sing how Germany is always victorious , how we win every war , and so is inevitable we win this one . Behind me marches triumphal the chorus , half undressed , half military . Then one day is clear we are not winning , we 're losing . I say to manager : We must get different second act curtain ! ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I keep on every night singing how we win and every minute we are losing . The brave chorus marches triumphant into defeat . " A man waved to Stift from the door of the restaurant . Stift waved back . He got up , kissed Sally 's hand . " So , now I must go . It is my lawyer . He tell me how bad off I am . For this I buy him dinner . Good-bye , Miss Sally . Is vonderrful . You , Stanley , I see in studio . We lunch in commissary and make conspiracy . " He left them to join his lawyer . " Well , Sally , " Grant said , " did n't you like him ? " " Very much . He 's sweet . " " His concern for Stohl , his loyalty ... " " Do you think it will succeed  --  the conspiracy ? " " Unlikely . It 's very hard here to get them to try something new . They 're doing so well with what they are doing . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stift has great influence . " " So evidently have you . " Grant flushed with pleasure . So it had registered ! " Not compared to Hugo , " he said modestly . " Do you know his pictures ? " " I think so . He did a Chevalier one , did n't he ? " Grant was let down by this . He was irritated . She was too offhand about greatness . It was as if she had said she thought , but could n't be quite sure , that she had read Hamlet . He began to rhapsodize . " But Hugo Stift is a genius ! He 's the only director who has a signa/ture . You know it 's a Stift picture even before it starts . I 'm thinking of writing a piece on him . I 'll call it The Touch . ' I 'm going to run all his films and list the things that he does that no other director would think of doing . He 's a genius . A darling besides  --  one of the kindest men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Sally as she studied the menu . " Would you like to see some of his films with me  --  in the projection room ? " " I 'm afraid I wo n't be here . I 'm leaving tomorrow . " " For where ? " " I 'm not quite sure yet . " Grant was frustrated . It was impossible to ignite Sally . She seemed immune to temptation , even of a projection room . Most girls loved to see films in projection rooms . The waiter came over and they ordered dinner . Sally did n't want wine . There was no joie de vivre in Sally . Grant chattered on . He told anecdote after anecdote revealing the grotesqueries of life in the film colony . They were well-greased anecdotes , tried and tested . But he could see that they were wasted on Sally . As he felt himself failing , he accelerated his tempo . He knew that he was talking too much but he could n't stop . Finally , in the kindest way , Sally said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertain me . I do n't have tobe amused . I like you very much as you are , I always have . " The geyser was quenched . Grant wanted to run away . He wanted togo back to his room in Coldwater Canyon to work on his play . He wouldrevenge himself on Sally in that . He hated her . He wanted to kill her . A silence fell . Sally broke it . " Eileen tells me you are very curious about me . What do you want to know ? I 'll tell you anything you want to know . " He looked at her , smouldering . His question came out of hatred . " Yes , " he said , " there is something I want to know . " " What is it ? " " Are you sleeping with Dr. Kenneth Ogden ? " His intention was to be brutal , but Sally answered as if he had asked her whether she had seen the last Garbo film . " No , " she said , " I 'm not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " No . He 's gone . " " Where to ? " " I do n't know . " " What broke it up ? " " I did . I planned to do it . I did it . " He looked at her . She was spooning up ice cream . He reflected thateven when she was frank , she was inscrutable . " Well , " he said , " if that 's what you wanted , if that has been yourmission and if you accomplished it , you must be happy . " " Happiness does n't enter into it . It was something I had to do . Anyway , there are no victories . No complete victories . " " No ? " " Mary hates me . She hates me for freeing her . That 's why I never told my mother . I struggled and struggled with the temptation to tell mother , to reveal to her what Ogden is . But there was so little time left to her . I could n't bear it  --  the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you never told her ? " " I never told her . " " But you did n't mind making Mary unhappy ? " " I told you  --  there are no total victories . " " Your hatred of Ogden  --  your desire for revenge  --  overrode every other consideration , did n't it ? " She met his eyes . " Yes , " she said , " it did . " Grant had ordered liqueurs . They sat sipping them . This girl , Grant thought  --  this child  --  is obsessed , fanatical . The child broke in on his reflections about her . " You knew my mother , did n't you ? " " Yes . I met her once at a concert . Eileen introduced me . " " Did you realize  --  how exquisite she was ? " " She was lovely . She had the same shallow hollows in her temples that you have . " " Her mind was exquisite too . Her sensibilities were exquisite . She was not for this world . She was for another world than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was touched by her . He put his hand on hers . " Well , yes , your mother was lovely . But she 's dead . Nothing can bep204done about that . Whatever harm Ogden did her , it 's over and done with . Darling , have n't you got anything better to do than chase after Ogden ? " He laughed . " Sweet , you do n't want to be like Ahab and the White Whale , do you ? " " Ahab had to . I had to . " He stared at her . " Does Ogden symbolize evil to you ? " " In a way . " " But that 's just plain silly . You overestimate Ogden . You take him at his own valuation . He 's just a physically magnetic , half-baked and half-educated charlatan , trying to get along the best way he knows how  --  through his phallus . That 's what he is  --  a traveling salesman of the phallus . That 's his banner ; he waves it about . Good line . Steady demand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense I ever heard of . How silly can you get ! " He was conscious of a pleasurable excitement in flagellating her . " I 've said most of that to myself . " " But it has n't stopped you ! " " Would you mind taking me to your house for a few minutes ? I 'd like a peep at Amos . " Grant pushed his chair back . " Certainly , " he said . " Delighted . " As they left the restaurant , Stift waved to them , grinning broadly . He blew a kiss to Sally . They drove to Coldwater Canyon in a shiny Tanner Cadillac limousine which Grant had rented for the evening . In the car they sat in silence for a while . Grant broke the silence . " Very strange it seems to me now  --  this summer in Salzburg . Is n't it to you ? Like a dream it seems , a chimera . Does it to you ? " " I know what you mean . " " I 'm sorry you could n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbi and his family  --  the rabbi 's daughter , Naomi , an enchanting creature . Like quicksilver . I wish you could have been there . I thought of you and wanted you there . " " I wish I could have been . I sent you a cable . " " I got it . " He remembered how her cable had disturbed him . He went on : " I wonder what they 're all doing ? Naomi  --  I wonder what she 's do/ing . I had an awful feeling , you know , all the time I was there , that they 're all sitting there , immobile , frozen , waiting for the executioner . While they wait they go to plays and concerts and discuss books . Why do n't they do something ? " " What can they do ? " " Run away . Run . Flee . " " Was Stephanie at your wedding ? " " No . She was in Bad Gastein getting Ian Leith out of jail . You know , do n't you , that she married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She married him in jail . Jeanne d'Arc act , Kaetchen says . " " You know him well , do n't you , Stephanie 's husband ? " " Fairly well . " " Is he the right kind of homosexual ? " " What an odd question ! " " Why ? " " Well , it 's like asking  --  of me , for instance  --  whether I 'm the right kind of heterosexual . Or of Ogden . You would say not  --  of Ogden anyway . I hope you 'd do better by me . They 're people , artists and imbeciles , saints and sinners , just like the rest of us . " " That 's what I asked , which is Ian ? " " He 's charming , very amusing and I think kind . I like him very much . But you know him . What do you think ? " " He will murder Stephanie . " Grant felt a chill . He stared at her . " My God , Sally , you 're hipped in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evilmonger . Are you stuck on demonism ? We 're not living in the Middle Ages , you know ? " " Have we advanced ? " " You ought to see a psychiatrist . " " Do you think so ? " The car crunched softly into the driveway of Grant 's villa . Grant handed Sally out of the car . " Would you ask the driver to wait for a few minutes ? To drive me back to the hotel ? " " Of course . " Grant spoke to the driver and led Sally into the house . From the bot/tom of the stairs he called up to Schwester . Sally ran up . Schwester appeared . She bobbed to Sally . They disappeared down the hall . Grant walked into the living room and switched on the light . It was a long , oblong room with bilious yellow walls of puckered stucco . Grant had never really looked at the room before ; he did now and realized that it was ugly . He moved to the bar in the corner and poured himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzing Sally . Why , she was a case ! He had , all this time , been in love with a nut . Of course , she believed that Ogden had killed her mother . But still . . . she had n't told him the truth , not the whole truth , he was convinced of that . As he thought , he felt a rising fury against Sally . He too wanted revenge ! Drink in hand , he began to pace the room . A curtain lifted : he saw , in clarity , still another version of the events of that summer . Why he himself had been nothing but a cog  --  a miserable . . . From upstairs he heard Sally saying good-bye to Schwester and her light footsteps as she came down . When she came back into the room her eyes were shining . " Oh , Stanley , what a darling Amos is ! He was asleep , of course , but I just barely touched his hand , and his fingers opened and held mine , And Schwester  --  how lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . It 's like Italy , she says . Then I found out she 's never been in Italy  --  only postcards . . . Why , Stanley ! What 's the matter ? " He was staring at her . He was livid . " I 've been thinking . " " What about ? " " This summer . About what happened this summer . " " It was eventful . " Grant put his glass down on a table . " When you came to Salzburg this summer  --  when you wrote me that letter ? " " Well ? " " About Eileen . That she was pregnant . . . " " Well ? " He came close to her , stood almost touching her . " Did you know  --  when you wrote that letter  --  that Ogden was in Salzburg ? " " I did . " " Did you know that he was living with Mary ? "  | " Yes . Ogden kept writing me . " " Two birds with one stone , eh ? Double objective ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . " " Do n't you ? " " Not in the least . I wrote you the simple facts about Eileen . You could have refused to have her come . You chose not to . " " I asked her to come because I wanted to see you ! " " That 's an aberration of yours , is n't it ? You ca n't really blame me for that , can you ? I never encouraged you . " " You never encouraged me because you were in love with Ogden . " " If it makes you feel better to believe that  --  well , indulge yourself . The truth is , Stanley . . . " He became abject , pitiful . " Dearest Sally , I love you . I adore you , from the first moment I  --  " " The truth is , dear Stanley , you 're spoiled . Talented people are alwaysspoiled . " " You knew it , did n't you , in Blue Hill  --  you knew it , how I longed for you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided you . . . " " You forced Eileen on me . " " Are you so weak ? " He was trembling with rage . He seized her by the shoulders . He held her fiercely close . He began forcing her to the sofa . " Are you going to rape me , Stanley ? " He let her go . " You 're horrible . You 're a monster . I loathe you . " " You do n't . Not really . And I am very fond of you . I 'm afraid I have to go now . I have to be up early to make a plane . " She started for the hall . Grant held the front door open for her . " Good night , dear Stanley . You 're lucky , you know  --  you 'll come to see it  --  to have Eileen , to have Amos . " " I never want to see you again . " She smiled . " That can be arranged . As I say , my dear , you 're spoiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , held the door open for her and went back to his place behind the wheel . Through the open window Grant spoke to her.  | " Why do n't you face the truth about yourself ? You 're in love with Ogden . If you have n't slept with him , you want to . Might clear things up for you if you did . " She spoke to the chauffeur . " One second please . " She opened her bag , took out a letter . She handed it to Grant through the window . " Here . A letter from my beloved . I meant to show it to Mary . I never did . I did n't have to . Read it  --  and please , after you 've read it , burn it . Good-bye , dear Stanley . Bless you . " She rolled up the window . The car moved off . Grant stood in the driveway , holding the letter in his hand . He watched the car till it disappeared . It had become chilly . Grant was shivering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this beastly climate , " he thought . He walked back into the living room and poured himself a drink to warm up . He sat in an overstuffedchair , under a lamp , Sally 's letter in his hand . He was shaking  --  he 'd caught a chill , no doubt about it . He read the letter . You dirty little tease . I waited two hours for you . What are you trying to prove ? Are you trying to get evidence to show Mary ? Well , here it is . Show her this . I do n't give a good goddamn about Mary and I thank you for getting me rid of her . It 'll be a great relief to me just as it was with your mother . I despise you . And I tell you this , you phony-spitituallittle bitch , honey , the next time I make a date to lay you , you 'd goddamn well ask for it . Your somewhat exercised but adoring , KennethGrant read and reread the letter . " I despise you . " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were alike , he and Ogden  --  two of a kind . As he studied the letter , he found something admirable in it  --  a man strong enough to burn his bridges . Then Grant remembered  --  it was so long since he had worked on his play , but now he remembered that his Ogden had done what he himself had decided , in Salzburg , to make him do ,  |p209At  this recollection he felt a glow of satisfaction , of reassurance . Life , he reflected , imitates art . His intuition had been sound . He sat in the chair for a long time , transfixed , memorizing the letter . Sally had asked him to burn it . Should he burn it ? He could n't . He could n't possibly . It was a DOCUMENT ! Should he put it into his play , as Grant 's favorite writer , Proust , put everything that ever happened to him into his novel ? But Sally , Sally ? Her faced hovered between him and Ogden 's scrawl . She was a child , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be playing tennis at the Yatcht Club , going to dances , falling in and out of love . Instead she was obsessed , manic , pursuing the White Whale like Ahab . She had actually thought of herself in connection with Ahab . And then another thought struck him . Eileen  --  Eileen and Sally . It seemed to him that he understood now what it was that held Eileen and Sally so close together , what their bond was , what it was that was at the heart of their friendship . They were both cloudstruck by abstractions , both driven in pursuit of abstractions  --  the abstraction of Evil , the abstraction of Good . A sound came to him from upstairs . Amos was crying  --  a faint pitifulwail . What , at the moment , was Amos 's obsession ? Well , Grant thought , whatever it was , Schwester would allay it . He sat and sat , thinking . Was everyone obsessed , driven from cradle to grave , seeking what was not to be found ? Was this the life force ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the naked interstices , between the demands of practical obligation , but at the core , under the burning glass ? He went upstairs to his study to copy Ogden 's letter into his notebook . Alexander Lowe lived in two worlds , the world of the internationally famous , naturally , but he was also a kind of Haroun-al-Raschid in another world , the world of the anonymous . His specialty , of course , the cause closest to his heart , was to marry off the sons of the great Centralp210European men of genius . These men now , under the shadow of the Mustache , were in duress themselves , since their works were combustible . The sons were in even worse case . They bore great names and staggeredunder the weight of them . By marrying them off well , Lowe made it possible for them to throw off the intolerable burden of trying to emulatetheir elders . He had once said to a friend that by inseminating the American upper classes with the genes of genius , he was single-handedly raising the cultural level in the USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not necessarily inherit the genius , Lowe tossed it off by saying that he left that to the geneticists . In his other world , the world of the anonymous , Lowe also gave a great deal of time and thought to relieving the privations of such of its members as were lucky enough to fall into his path . For the proprietressof a small Viennese restaurant who found her windows smashed one morning and swastikaed messages under her door , he got a job as cook with a modestly prosperous New York businessman of his acquaintance . He provided translators to publishing houses , bilingual secretariesto export and import houses , got odd jobs as waitresses , governesses , companions to the elderly and nurses for infants for all sorts of refugees who had had other backgrounds in their European lives but who were adaptable . A modest scholar who had spent his life revivifying the Etruscans became a dishwasher in Lowe 's favorite New York restaurant ; for a minor journalist he got a job as room clerk in his hotel , the Ambassador , where he lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of getting visas , work permits . He became a one-man adjunct , incessant and unpaid , to HIAS , the organization established to get refugees out from under the coming holocaust in Europe . He farmed out children whose parents he knew to families of the upper crust world in England , Mexico , New York and California . Lowe quietly boasted that , in this emergency , not one of his upper crust friends refused him . The great world in which he moved did not know about his other world , except when he was forced to bring it to its attention by requestsfor jobs , help to get visas , provide cash for crying necessities . He got money , for example , to set up Miss Dannfeld , who had worked at a jeweler 's in Innsbruck , in a tiny shop on East 13th Street , where she sold costume jewelry of her own design . The costume jewelry was ugly but Lowe kept buying and buying it , sending it as Christmas presentsp211to his effulgent ladies . They became known as Lowes even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests : " You 're not wearing your Lowe today ! " " I 'll buy them , " she replied , " as many as you like , but I wo n't wear them ! " To which Lowe cited the example of his Egeria in London who had become , in some sort , an agent for Miss Dannfeld 's handiwork . She not only bought it to give to her friends but blazoned it herself . When a friend teased her about its ugliness , she replied that it was to help one of Kaetchen 's hapless protegees and she made her friend see , behind the vulgar configuration of the ornament , an Image of Compassion . . . Then the London ladies , too , ordered it , wore it , becamecompassionate . Of course Lowe sent several dozens each right away to Eileen and to Mary in California . They now became Miss Dannfeld 's salesladies . Lowes rode the bosoms of the friends of both in Beverly Hills and Santa Barbara . For a while , nourished by these stimuli , Miss Dannfeld 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't last . The uninstructed public , who did n't know Lowe , who did n't see the Image , but saw only the costume jewelry , stayed away from Miss Dannfeld 's shop and the day came when it had to close . Lowe promptly got Miss Dannfeld , a spinster of sixty , employment with another spinster of his acquaintance who was eighty and very rich . Miss Dannfeld became her companion and sat in her box every Wednesday night at the opera . Very often the older spinster felt too feeble to go and Miss Dannfeld became a patronesswho was able to invite her music-loving friends to her box at the opera . Of course the first time it happened she invited Lowe . This was a mistake . He had , he explained , to undergo these tortures in Salzburg , for diplomatic reasons , but , thank God , not in this blessed New York . The moment Lowe heard that Mary Kennicott and Dr. Ogden had come to the parting of the ways  --  Mary had telephoned him daily to beg him to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an opening , there was a job vacant , there was young Federn . Who in the world was so admirably qualified to succeed Dr. Ogden as head of Mary 's clinic as the brilliant young intern from Vienna ? True , Federn had n't achieved this internship yet , but that was for extraneous reasons . In the normal course of things  --  had his father not written a play which irritated the Catholic medical hierarchy in Vienna , werep212there not a pipeline from the aerie above Salzburg transmitting prejudicialsentiments that made even the elder Federn insecure  --  his son would even now undoubtedly be an intern in Vienna . For his present , exiguous purpose Lowe felt justified in erasing the extraneous reasons . He felt , too , that he could advance Federn 's cause more strongly with Mary if there were competition for his services . He telephoned his friend Dr. Leo Binder for an appointment . Dr. Binder was , even for him , unusually grumpy on the telephone . He was n't feeling well , he had terrible sinus trouble , he was seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowe to come up right away . Perhaps Lowe 's gossip might cheer him up . Dr. Leo Binder was not only an Olympian and fantastically expensive surgeon ; he was also a manic bibliophile . The Binder collection of manuscriptsand first editions was famous . He was monarch of everything he surveyed and he surveyed the most opulent bodies in the USA . To be operated on by Dr. Binder was like getting a decoration . He was said to be brutal ; he had a reputation for avarice and human indifference . But a penumbra of chic surrounded those who submitted to his virtuosity . The simple phrase " He was operated Dr. Binder " was a Masonic password . Even when , under his ministrations , the patient died , the survivors were consoled by the fact that their dear one had been killed by Dr. Binder . In having supplied Dr. Binder , they had done more than was possible ; there was a necromancy in the mere procedure which induced complacency among the bereaved . Lowe found the necromancer , fully dressed , stretched out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck in each nostril . Dr. Binder 's thin , bony face was creased in suffering . In a staccato bark he asked Lowe questions about the political situation in Austria . Lowe gave his view , which was that the tenant of the aerie would overreach himself and was headed for destruction . Dr. Binder did not agree . He had many correspondents in the medical profession in Europe . From these intelligences he gathered that it was Europe that was headed for destruction . He became surly . There were plenty of people in this country too , he barked , who thought that the fellow in the aerie had got hold of a good idea . Many of these had been his patients . He had , moreover , saved many of their lives . Dr. Binder looked remorseful.  |p213He  brushed the distasteful subject aside . " What 'd you come for ? " he snapped . Dr. Binder was shrewd . He knew that people , even Lowe , of whom , within his limitations for affection , he was fond , did n't come to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlist his aid in behalf of a brilliant young doctor from Vienna . Dr. Binder adjusted the toothpicks in his nostrils and groaned . " You want to get him into Mount Sinai ! " said Dr. Binder accusingly , as if Mount Sinai were an illicit resort . " Mount Sinai preferably , " said Lowe . " Impossible . Out of the question . Long waiting list now . Besieged . " He pointed to his desk covered with letters . " You 'll find twenty-thirty letters there : Berlin  --  Munich  --  all over . Impossible . Had you told me on the phone what you were coming for , I 'd have saved you the trouble . " " This young man is rather special . You will like him . He is Kurt Federn , the son of . . . " Dr. Binder pulled the toothpicks out of his nostrils . He sat up . " Not the son of  --  ! " " Exactly . I told him you might be interested in the works of his father . I know you admire them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have n't they been burned  --  the works of his father ? " " Not the manuscripts , " said Lowe . " I have asked Kurt to bring them . The Houghton Library at Harvard is interested . " This last was an improvisation which Lowe thought privately might be worth following up . " I want first look at them , " said the doctor . " I might arrange that , " said Lowe . " Are you in touch with this boy ? " " Naturally . " " Could you ask him  --  while you 're about it  --  could he get me anything of von Hofmannsthal 's ? " " Possibly . I 'll find out . " " Now , Lowe , I 'll tell you . Mount Sinai is practically impossible . We 're overstaffed now . But , maybe I can get him in somewhere else . I 'll talk to the boy . If I like him , I might even ... "  | " Yes ? " " Make him my assistant . My present one is getting married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my schedule . " He leaned back against the pillow , reinserted the discolored toothpicks . He was exhausted . Lowe got up . The pronged interview was over . Back in his room at the Ambassador Lowe wrote to Federn , telling him to come to New York at once , that he had a work permit and a job in prospect for him . He would cable the money for a third-class passage , which was all he could , at the moment , manage to scrape together . He asked him to speak to his father about his manuscripts . He felt that he might dispose of them advantageously here . When he finished the letter he put in a call to Mary Kennicott at Santa Barbara . She was frantic . When was he coming ? He could n't right away , he explained , as he was waiting for his young friend from Vienna , whom surely she would rememberhaving met in Salzburg . Mary did and warmly . She had heard Fidelio with him . So sympathetic ! But it was terrible for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sixes and sevens . She needed him . She needed him badly . Why did n't he bring the young man with him ? Lowe said he would try but the fact was that Federn was up for a post at Mount Sinai . Still , he would try . Perhaps he could swing it . If he could n't , he would come alone . Between Eileen and Lowe there had developed a close rapport . She had become , in some sort , his opposite number in Hollywood . They had the refugee problem in common . Eileen had become particularly worried about Naomi . She and Naomi had kept up , since the Grants had left Salzburg , a lively correspondence . The Jewish studies which Eileen had started with Naomi in Salzburg had continued by letter ; their exchange became a kind of correspondence course in Judaism . Naomi had written to Eileen , for example , about an adorable character named Moses Hess , who had written a book ( which Naomi had 1 resentlysent her ) called Rome and Jerusalem . Eileen read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Jewish problem , which since her marriage to Grant had become Eileen 's problem , could only be solved by the establishment of a national home for the Jews . Iles had been the first articulate Zionist . Eileen took that on too . She beganp215to read up on Zionism . Hess was a friend of Karl Marx , who despised him as an impractical dreamer . He was indeed a dreamer . He had married a prostitute for whom he did n't care much simply to demonstrate that all human beings must show love for each other , without distinction . The Hesses had , as a matter of fact , a happy and unclouded marriedlife . The ex-prostitute stuck to her husband through all vicissitude and deprivation . Eileen fell in love with Moses Hess as she had fallen in love with the Hebrew prophets  --  the coevals of her son 's ancestor . Eileen became uncomfortable when she came upon a passage in which Hess heaped contempt on his fellow Germans , who , in an attempt at protective coloration , changed their names the better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's name was not his own . She did n't know what his real name was ; she did n't dare ask him . It became increasingly a suppressed torment to Eileen that her husband  --  she hated to admit it , even to herself , but the realization kept nagging at her  --  that her husband lacked spirituality . Her mother had been a long time adying but when she finally did , Eileen returned , calm and serene , to Beverly Hills , her husband , her baby , and the Jewish problem . Grant was amazed to find her so tranquil . Her tranquility came from her certainty that she would meet her mother in heaven . What made her sad was not the separation from her mother , which was only temporary , but the fact that Grant did n't share in the least her own confidence in the reunion . Grant stated bluntly that he did n't believe in the immortality of the soul . Eileen could n't understand how , without this belief , one could live at all . Grant had never met his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a meeting would never take place . It made Eileen sad . In any case , Eileen 's activities in behalf of the refugees took her mind temporarily off Grant 's agnosticism . She would concentrate on that later . She knew that the task of converting Grant to his religion would take time and patience and she was prepared to expend them . She had become more Jewish than the Jews . She was constantly after the studio heads to provide jobs for Jewish writers and journalists from Central Europe . These tycoons liked Eileen . They thought it quaint , but winning , that she , a Catholic , should be so fervently enlisted in the cause of their own unfortunate coreligionists . Eileen had become a great favorite ( and only slightly a figure of fun ) in the film community . Shep216was liked even by those who did n't particularly care for Grant and there were quite a few of those . In her salvaging efforts Eileen was incessant , tireless , so much so that she sometimes fatigued the tycoons . Still , they received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife  --  the wife of a Name Writer  --  she had an automatic position of prominence in the film colony . But Eileen did n't restrict herself to Grant 's circle . She made forays outside it . She enlisted the powerful aid of Thomas Mann , for example , himself a refugee , though not on racial grounds . Eileen wanted to save-at-large , but what she wanted to do most in the world was to save Naomi . This became an obsessive idea with her . She wanted to save Naomi 's parents too but , as they were n't writers or artists , she was n't sure she could do anything for them , but save Naomi she must . Until Naomi was there , in Beverly Hills , in her own sight , beside her , she could n't rest . As her letters to Naomi , usually so swiftly answered , began to remain unanswered , she became increasingly worried . She sent prepaid cables . No reply . And then , one day , her heart sank . A letter she had sent six weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in German : " No longer at this address . " Eileenfelt panic . She telephoned to Lowe in New York . He must , through his connections , find out something about Naomi . He must trace Naomi . Lowe promised to try . Providentially , on the very morning of Eileen 's frantic call , Lowe had a letter from Vienna from Vincent Edward Aldridge , the Third . The third Aldridge was the only son of the second Aldridge , a distinguished international lawyer , who had a strong penchant for Lowe . The second Aldridge , as he did n't mind telling his friends , enjoyed Lowe 'S society almost more than anyone 's . Lowe had brought him to Stohl 's palace in Salzburg , where he had enjoyed himself immensely . Aldridge had helped finance Stohl 's first American tour . He loved the theater and actresses and Lowe had given him access to both . Above all , Lowe had given him help and council in the aggravating problems that kept coming up in the upbringing of his son , the third Aldridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to him , although he was pushing thirty , would n't settle down to anything . He was interested only in the arts , ballet chiefly , h allet , in fact , madly . But unless you were a choreographer or a composer or a scene designer or a conductor or even a dancer , there was really nothing much you could do about satisfying a passion for ballet exceptp217to back it financially . This , the third Aldridge kept doing at the expense of the second . The latter kept imploring Lowe to find some job for the boy , something to do with the arts , he said , with a gesture indicating a vague and fathomless territory . Lowe had finally got the boy a job on a national magazine published by a friend of his with a view to his reviewingballets . But , as the second Aldridge had decided to back no more ballets , there were no ballets to review . Lowe then suggested to the boy to write articles which he , Lowe , undertook to place for him . Young Aldridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a wonderful idea . He had had many " experiences " which , he was sure , would make fascinating articles . Lowe kept asking for them but , when he came right down to it , Vincent found writing an inconvenience . When Lowe got tired of asking for a product which was not forthcoming , he felt he ought to take the third Aldridge to task . " You know , my dear Vincent , " he said , " articles that are not written are seldom published . " The third Aldridge adored this remark ; he pronounced it " echt Kaetchen " and kept quoting it to his friends . Such was the uneasy posture between the two Aldridges when a horrendousincident brought on a crisis . Aldridge , Sr. , had a so-called " cottage " in Bar Harbor , Maine , where he spent his summers . It was a great , rambling wooden structure which had been built by the first Aldridge in the era of James G. Blaine , a fellow cottager . Aldridge loved the place ; he had been brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When his wife died , he kept it on , hoping his son would live there as happily as he had done . He usually stayed till after Labor Day , unless his practice took him to Europe , but he always managed to get in a few weeks at the Bar Harbor manse in the fall . He would then go to Boston to see his doctor for a checkup ; Aldridge had a fanatical belief in Boston doctors ; when he had to undergo surgery he invariably submitted to it in Massachusetts General . In the fall of 1936 he wrote , as usual , to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Boston for reservations . He received a letter from the management stating that they were terribly sorry but that the hotel was full up ; they could not accommodate him . Now Vincent Edward Aldridge , the Second , was , quite simply , not a man for whom there were no accommodations to be had in a hotel . Furious  --  and bewildered  --  he telephoned the Ritz . He asked to speak to the manager . The manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange question : " Am I speaking to Mr. Aldridge , the Second , or to Mr. Aldridge , the Third ? " " My son has n't been here for a month , " Aldridge , Sr. , said . He was exasperated . The manager hastened to assurehim that his reservations would be in order . Aldridge , Sr. , had an afterthought . " And what the hell difference would it make if it were my son ? Is n't he good enough for your hotel ? " The manager slid out from under . He said there had been a misunderstanding , that he had other calls waiting and he hoped Mr. Aldridge would be pleased with his accommodations . He would reserve his usual suite for him overlooking the Public Garden . The incident bothered Aldridge . It bothered him exceedingly . He brooded on it on the train to Boston . He decided that he would damn well get to the bottom of it . In Boston , after his session with his old friend the doctor , who was very pleased with his condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fleeting euphoria at his doctor 's good report . But the euphoriaebbed . The more he thought of the strange incident over the reservation , the refusal , then the manager 's obvious relief when he found out he was talking to the father and not to the son , the more it baffled him . It had a sinister aspect , somehow . He beat about in his brain for a possible explanation . Could it be that his son was a kleptomaniacand stole the silverware from the dining room ? He 'd heard of eccentricities like that . He sent for the manager . The manager , who knew that he was dealing with a VIP , was nervous . What he did not know was that he was also facing a highly skilled and subtle questioner . Yes , yes , the second Aldridge was very well pleased with his suite . He 'd occupied it often before . He thanked the manager for reserving it for him , especially when the hotel was so crowded . The manager quivered . To make him less nervous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He offered him a cigar which the manager accepted , asking permission to reserve it for the future as he was not allowed to smoke while on duty . Aldridge then gave him three cigars to gild the managerial future . The manager was grateful and began to sidle out . He was , he explained , needed elsewhere . Aldridge wanted to keep him only for a minute . He had a slight curiosity which the manager could satisfy easily . He elicited one interesting fact : that his son had several times written for reservations in his father 's name . They'dp219make the reservations and then find out , on the boy 's arrival , that it was n't his father at all . This amused Aldridge . He thought it very funny . Did n't the manager see how funny it was ? He came up to the manager and slapped him on the shoulder . " Pretty cute , do n't you think ? Boy knew he 'd get better reservations that way  --  this suite for instance . " Did n't the manager think it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgery , was it ? All the boy had to do was to change a numeral  --  did n't the manager see that ?  --  otherwise their names were identical . Aldridge thought it was damned funny . He laughed aloud . Hollowly , the manager echoed his interlocutor 's laughter and , perspiring , turned again , under cover of simulated hilarity , to escape . There was just one more little point on which Aldridge was curious . The little points kept coming up . By the time the successional little points were cleared up , Aldridge , in a gray voice , but with great courtesy , thanked the manager for his trouble and permitted him to depart . In spite of the reassurances given him by his doctor , Aldridge , Sr. , suddenly felt very old . He sat in an armchair looking out at the glowingautumn foliage . He did not see it . He was staring into an abyss . Finally , he got up . He put in a call to Lowe in New York and invited him to dinner this very evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aldridge said he must break it . Lowe said he would . That night , in a private dining room in the Union Club , Aldridge told Lowe the story as he had finally wormed it out of the manager . He was having difficulty telling it even to Lowe , but finally he blurted it out  --  his son was on the hotel blacklist . The staff had been instructed on no account to give him a reservation . By getting reservations in his father 's name he had eluded this boycott . Lowe was the only one in the world , Aldridge said , to whom he could tell what he was going to tell . The fact was , well , the fact was , that his son 's habits were peculiar . He would leave the hotel about midnight , impeccably dressed , and return at three , four , five in the morning disheveled , sometimes all bloodied up . Sometimes he would bring strange companions with him , truck drivers , sailors . All this had been reported to the management by the lift boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't good for the hotel . Aldridge put it to Lowe . What was he to do ? Had Lowe been aware of the boy 's proclivities ?  |p220Lowe  said that of course he had . Speaking , as usual , very quietly , almostinaudibly , so that Aldridge had occasionally to cup his hand behind his ear to catch what he was saying , Lowe went on to extol the boy in measured terms . There was no young man of whom Lowe was fonder . He had immense charm , for one thing , and exquisite sensibility . He was brilliant . He had n't quite found himself yet , but he had great promise . He took out a letter he 'd had from him a few days before from a city in the Midwest where he had gone especially to see an exhibition of Houdon busts . Lowe read a sentence aloud : " You 've never seen anything so lovely , dearest Kaetchen , so incredibly lovely as the marbled lace in the jabots . It 's like Mozart ! " Lowe put the boy 's letter back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense was acute , extraordinarilyacute , but Lowe had seen that in others . What endeared the boy to Lowe most of all , a quality he had that other esthetes did n't have , was his kindness , his sympathy . There was n't in the world a kinder , gentler person than Vincent Edward Aldridge , the Third . When he had asked him for help once for a poor creature who was in a dreadful plight , young Aldridge 's eyes had filled with tears . Lowe had had to restrainhim from giving much more than he had asked for . No . Such greatness of soul was rare . Personally he , Lowe , would be proud to have a son like that . Aldridge , he said , should be proud . Pride did not rise in Aldridge . Should he be proud of a son who is kicked out of hotels ? Should he be proud of a son whose preferences . . , the father could not finish . His mind sheid away from the contemplation of these ghastly preferences . Lowe admitted that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sad . But it should arouse sympathy , not censure . For his part Lowe 's heart went out to those so conditioned . Even though they were not sorry for themselves , Lowe was sorry for them . On numerous occasionsLowe had observed their desperation , a desperation that came from an intimation of doom . " My boy is doomed then ? " said Aldridge . " Not at all . Not necessarily . He may get married . He probably will . " " Who on earth . . . ? " " Some distinguished lady of the same persuasion . There are many such marriages . Very happy . " Aldridge looked at Lowe hopelessly . He wiped his forehead with ap221large silk handkerchief . It was n't his idea of a happy marriage . It did not suggest St. James 's , Mendelssohn , orange blossoms , rice . Lowe went on . In the first place , such aberrations were far more widely dispersed , even in Aldridge 's own circle , than Aldridge might suspect . He enumerated a list of names , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diplomacy and statecraft . As a patron of the arts , Aldridge should feel gratitude rather than condemnation . He asked him , for example , to contemplate Michelangelo . The latter , Lowe was sure , would have been blacklisted by the Ritz in Boston . Aldridge did n't feel like contemplating Michelangelo ; the only image that rose before him was of his dear boy , his only son and heir , his mother 's darling , staggering into the Ritz lobby at five o'clock in the morning , all bloodied up . He could n't feel pride , he could feel only revulsionand horror . Lowe saw that his friend was suffering . He looked ten years older than when he had last seen him , two weeks ago . " But what shall I do with him ? " he asked finally . " Shall I tell him Iknow ? " Lowe advised against that . He suggested that Aldridge send his son to Europe where ballets were frequent . Aldridge grasped at this . When he parted from Lowe , he clasped his hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , at not having to have it out with the boy . He missed his dead wife poignantly but he was glad she had n't lived to make the discovery that cruel fate had reserved for him . Two weeks later Aldridge and Lowe saw the third Vincent off on the Europa . No sooner had Eileen hung up after telling him her hideous worry about Naomi than he returned to Vincent 's letter . It was delightful and funny as always , but there was a dark note in it too . There was something new and horrid abroad in Vienna , a spirit he could n't tolerate , a mimicry everywhere of " those nasty Germans " whom Vincent could n't endure . He was homesick for Lowe and his other New York friends and was , as a matter of fact , thinking of coming home . Where would Lowe be ? It was unthinkable , his returning only to discover that Lowe was somewhere else . Reading the letter Lowe had an inspiration . It was reallyan inspiration . Under the afflatus of it he began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to save Naomi  --  provided she could be found  --  only one way and he had hit upon it . He went backp222to the telephone and called the overseas operator . He put in a call to Aldridge , the Third , at the Hotel Imperiale in Vienna , an establishment , he felt quite sure , more latitudinarian than the Ritz in Boston . On Lowe 's desk was the silver-framed photograph of his English love . He picked up the photograph and looked at it long and tenderly . She was the center of his being . He referred everything to her . If this , his just-born little inspiration , worked out , he would have something amusingto write her . He would write her tonight , as soon as the overseas call came in . He 'd had a letter from her yesterday . It was in his pocket . He took it out and looked at it again , though he 'd already read it half a dozen times . She had enclosed a little snapshot . It was taken in her garden . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat , the vast brim of which almost covered her eyes . The smock was open and on her blouse was pinned a Lowe . It was to show him that she wore it even in the country . He was moved , painfully moved . He put the letterback in his pocket . The little snapshot put him in an emotional , reminiscentmood . In a kind of trance , he began walking around the room , his hands crossed behind his back . He found himself going from one to the other of the four pastels on the walls , views of his home town : Czernowitz . One showed the square in front of the Primaria , the City Hall , very busy , with little tram cars , salmon colored , peasants , horses and carts and oxen , a little group in tall , fur hats . The artist had written in pencil : Rathaus Platz in Czernowitz . There was a little wooden shed where people waited for the tram cars . He remembered waiting there as a small boy with his father . He moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The coffin , hexagonal in shape and partly covered by a varicolored cloth , was on a plank on wheels drawn by two bullocks . Lowe remembered . It was a young man , a contemporary of his , who had died . The boy 's father , old and bent , walked just ahead of the bullocks , supporting himself on a long staff . Beside the coffin and behind it other mourners walked . Begrabnis am Pruth , the legend read . And there was the Pruth , in the middle distance , with the unrailed wooden bridge across it , and the cluster of white headstones in the graveyard to which the little procession was moving and the stylized tier of hills beyond . Lowe had known the dead boy but he now could n't remember his face . He stood before Alter hid Friedhof , the old Jewish cemetery . The headstones , with their faded Hebrew inscriptions , the let/ters stark and jagged , were often surmounted by sprigs of flowers or blossoming branches . Apple blossoms , probably , Lowe thought , aware that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . The headstoneslurched every which way , toward each other and away from each other , as if in a kind of bacchanal . His parents lay in that graveyard . Lowe leant close to see if he might possibly trace them but the inscriptionswere indecipherable . In any case , he did n't know Hebrew . He had known it as a child , but he had long since forgotten . Abruptly , Lowe turned away from his past to his present . This was the trick black and white kitten . Monica had sent it to him . It was inscribed : " For Kaetchen . " It showed a white kitten with green eyes . But , if you turned it over , it was a black kitten with green eyes . It amused the children of his friends . The telephone rang . At last  --  Vincent ! But it was Varina . Lowe was delighted to hear the throaty voice and the slow drawl . He had n't heard it in a long time . Where had she been ? With her parents in Manchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him . She had to see him right away . Something momentous had happened or was about to happen . She could n't possibly tell it to him over the telephone , she had to see him to tell him and to see him alone . He invited her to dinner that evening in the Colony . No , not the Colony , there 'd be too many there who would join them . He switched the invitation to Klinger 's . Klinger 's , Varina agreed , would be perfect . Lowe felt himself in a kind of emotional disarray . There was only one way to find calm  --  to write to Monica . He was never so happy as when he was writing to Monica ; he felt close to her then ; it was like talking to her . He sat at the writing desk . He began by thanking her for the snapshot  --  how touched he had been to find her wearing the Lowe even when she was gardening . He settled into the long rhythm of his epistolary style . The telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This time it was Vincent Edward Aldridge , the Third , calling from Vienna.  |p224Lowe  became very busy ; two days elapsed before he was able to continuehis letter to Lady Monica . It was always so in their correspondence . Their letters were running diaries ; they were constantly redating the successive entries . They each led busy lives ; they began letters in the lulls and continued them in the next lulls . He would get a letter : " 6 P.M.  --  before Covent Garden  --  1 A.M.  --  after Covent Garden . " Everything that happened to Lowe , the twists and turns of his involvementswith people , were , for him , simply stuffs and texture which he appraised from the point of view of whether they were weavable for his beloved . Would they interest her ? Would they entertain her ? Would they provoke her ? The day before he had sat down to write her , about the odd turn with Varina , the extraordinary apparition of Dr. Ogden , about Vincent 's tragic cable  --  he had plenty really and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he felt a sharp incisionof pain below his heart . He staggered to his feet , writhing , and with the familiar apprehension : Is this it then ? And the letter to Monicaunfinished ! He swallowed one of the nitroglycerine pills he always kept by him and , when he had caught his breath , called his doctor who asked him to come at once to see him . He did . He returned . It was all right . Things were no worse . He had a reprieve . He was grateful . He could finish his letter . He would tell her everything as he always did . Except about the nitroglycerine pill ; he had never said a word to Monica , nor to anyone else , about that . It was his habit to write in the new date and the hour in red ink and to underline it in red so that Monica would be the one with him in time . He did so now and resumed the interrupted conversation . Well , I have been busy , busier than usual . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few nights ago , a kind of dissolvingcomedy , verging on farce and tragedy . How often , do n't you agree , the concerns and agonies of people , viewed from outside their frantic obsessions , emerge as farce ! They suffer ; we , not subject to their prejudices , can only smile . For example , Aldridge , Sr. , and Varina 's par/ents  --  I have had extraordinary interviews with these three parents . But that will come later . I have to begin at the beginning ; as you know I am methodical . First of all about Vincent and Naomi . I take pride in this : that for once , at long last , I have arranged a completely utilitarian marriage . I know that you have teased me and scarified me in the past for marriages I have engineered , which seemed to you doomed to breakage from the start . But this time , you will have to agree , I have arranged a marriage , this world being what it is , for the soundest possible reasons , to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an angel . Ile went at once to Salzburg and did n't rest till he found Naomi . Ten ( lays before , the poor girl had taken a walk by the Salzach . She returned to her parents ' flat , that cozy , sparklingly clean little flat which I describedto you in my letter last summer telling you about Stanley Grant 's wedding . She found her parents on the floor dead , with a swastikasign on their bodies . They were private , unofficial murders , done by unknown zealots who could not curb their impatience for the legal protocolwhich is sure to be coming . Vincent found Naomi living with relatives . She is , he told me ( he called two days ago from Salzburg ) , in acataleptic state . He asked to marry her and to bring her to me and to her devoted friend , Eileen . She showed no interest . She had , Vincent said , died too . Fortunately , Naomi 's aunt and uncle saw Vincent 's advent as a kind of miracle , a kind of intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning a cable from Vincent . They are on the Queen Mary . I shall greet the bride and groom on Tuesday morning , the 28th . Vincent asked me on the telephone to inform his father . So I did . You will find , buried in the early pages of this letter , a complete account of my dinner with Vincent 's father . When I told Aldridge , Sr. , that his son would probably marry , I did not think the sacrament would take place quite so soon . Since you know that I am a frustrated dramatist I will set down the conversation exactly as it took place ; it will give me the illusionthat I 'm writing a play . Alas , I could never have invented such a dialogue . Lowe : Congratulations ! I 've just heard from your son . He is married . Aldridge : I do n't believe it . For God 's sake ! To whom ? Lowe : A lovely young girl whom I know . Vincent asked me to tell you . Aldridge : You say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Naomi Aldridge . Aldridge ( apoplectic ) : I mean her maiden name . Lowe : I have to tell you  --  I really ca n't remember.  |p226Aldridge  : I thought you knew her ! Is she one of THOSE ? For a moment I did n't know what he meant by " one of THOSE . " Then I remembered my prophecy ( so mistaken ) in the Union Club and I quickly reassured him . " Not at all , " I said , " perfectly normal . You will be delighted with her , I assure you . " " What 's her name again  --  her first name ? " " Naomi . " " What kind of a name is that ? " There was a pause , then a horrid conviction . " Is she Jewish ? " " Yes , " I said , " she is . " " I knew there was a catch in it ! " He hung up . A half hour later he called up to apologize for being rude . His apology was a continuation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am Jewish because I 'm so different . I 'm quite used to this . Most of my elegant friends talk about Jews before me as if I were not one . It slips their minds . But do you see what I mean when I say that even tragic events are edged in comedy ? The farce I reserve for Varina . I had to intercede with her parents over a surprising matrimonial caprice of their daughter 's . That I did not enjoy . Varina 's father tests even my tolerance . Vincent told me once that when Lawson , Sr. , was airing himselfone day on his favorite topic , a crony of his teased him for seemingly making an exception of me . " Oh , " he said , " Lowe 's all right . He 's a white Jew . " I do n't really deserve this exception . It has to be faced that my complexion is quite dark . Lawson 's color blind . The intelligence which Varina had to convey to me in the privacy of Klinger 's ( this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when next you come : a vast caravansery in fake-Bavarian and ersatz gemiitlichkeit ) was that she has fallen in love with , and is trying to persuadeto marry her , the hochstapler of the hochstaplers , Dr. Kenneth Ogden . He is superb , you know , really superb , a Cagliostro of the New Science , Arch Pontiff of the Couch  --  but then you know him and know all about him . What was it you said to me about him once , that he it every other inch a gentleman , or was that about someone else ? I have managed to keep Varina on the right side of her parents by main strength . Last summer in London it was a near thing , as you know . Later when she was in the slough of despond over Ian , I made her join them in Scotland . Well , here she was at Klinger 's , lovely as ever , her voice as musical and deliberate as ever , her gray eyes , like deep water , as still as ever . She gives every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragile . She found herself sitting next to Ogden one afternoon in Radio City ! In that dim vastness these two molecules were magnetized . Since then Ogden has been rushing her . She has been trying , she told me , to persuade him to marry her . I advised , as strongly as I could , against it ; so , she told me , had Ogden . Ogden joined us for coffee . I must say that , in a rather revolting way , he is very amusing . He is the most uninhibited man I 've ever met . He begged me to save him from Varina ; he adores her so he fears to be enslaved . On the other hand , did n't I think that Varina should try a heterosexual for once ? By showingVarina that the so-called normals could make love too , he feels that he has struck a blow for the heteros against the homos . Varina loved it all . He has such abundant animal magnetism that he makes the most outrageous suggestions sound natural . Along the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really like to be like him but that he lacks the concentration . ( Something in it too ; I 'll come to Grant later . ) He 'd heard that Varina 's parents were terrors . What did I think ? Would Varina 's parents cut her off if he married her ? If that were so he really could n't risk it ; he had enough for himself but he could n't afford to keep Varina in the style to which she was accustomed . Etc . Etc . It ended by my promising to break the news of their engagement to Varina 's parents . I went to see the Lawsons to break the glad news . You know , they took it surprisingly well . Their expectations of Varina were so low that Dr. Ogden seemed to them less a catastrophe than they might have supposed . They had always complained  --  and , quite in the tradition , to me  --  that Varina seemed to care for no one but Jews . I had often consoled them about Varina 's specialty . They are blissfully ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what , thanks to Stephanie 's heroism , they have escaped . Well , they toted Ogden up : a doctor , a dubiousbranch , but he had headed Mary Kennicott 's clinic , had n't he ? Mary was eccentric but socially impeccable . He was good-looking , Varina 's mother admitted , though in a flashy , vulgar way . It went on for quite a time , adding and subtracting . But Lawson , Senior , managed to dish up a crumb of comfort for himself . " Anyway , " he said in a mournful summary , " he 's not Jewish ! " As he has put me in a special category he felt under no obligation to apologize . Mrs. Lawson appeared to be quite reconciled , but Mr. Lawson is a hard nut to crack . He 's going to have Ogden'srecord looked into . He has , he said , ways of finding out . Private detectives , I suppose he means . I am sure one of them will go to Cleveland , who knows where else . Varina could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sure Ogden would . Poor Varina ! With every naturalp228gift  --  looks and style and a warm heart  --  she is at sea . I tremble for Varina . I love her dearly , as I know you do . She is defenseless , totally without guile . The poor child chose the wrong parents . All her choices seem to be wrong . Well , I have written quite enough . I have put you au courant of .. . The telephone rang . Resignedly Lowe got up to answer it . He coped with the subsequent conversation , adding it as he endured it , to the unfinishedletter . The moment he hung up he returned to his desk . He dipped the special pen into the little bottle of red ink and made the notation : AFTER TELEPHONE CALL FROM THE GRANTS : Just as you were on the point of getting rid of me the telephone rang . It was the Grants from Hollywood . I spoke to both of them . Eileen is wildly excited about the prospect of her reunion with her cherished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring her out and that Naomi must stay with her . Over the phone Grant was transparently exalted by the prospect of Naomi 's arrival . He 's an odd one , that Grant . A Narcissus who is repelled by his reflection ( Ogden is entranced by his ) . Both types can cause trouble but on the whole I 'd rather deal with megalomaniacs who are extroverted than those who are introverted , would n't you ? Grant is omniverous ; I 'm not sure he will wear well . Unquestionablytalented . He 's overpolite , insincerely effusive and too eager to live up to a reputation for brilliance . He 's constantly in love with women who belong to other people and who , even if they did n't , would n't want to belong to him . He meets Rene Wolfsohn 's girl ( very distinguishedand attractive she is  --  Grant 's taste is impeccable ) and is off at once spinning romantic fantasies about her . He confessed to me the day after his wedding that , even during the ceremony , he felt that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding he fell in love with Naomi ! Poor Eileen ! I am afraid she will pay dearly for her Hebrew lessons . Grant longs to meet you . You may even like him ! Stephanie writes me she is coming to Hollywood with Ian because she expects to act in Grant 's play . She never will but Grant promised her the part . He will promise anything to anybody ; he is so anxious to be liked , however momentarily . And , with all this , he is married to one of the dearest girls in the world . She 's a rarity , really good . Of course , she 's humorless and , in many respects , quite absurd . She 's a highbrow , you know , according to a definition I once heard somewhere of the highbrow as a person edu/cated above his intelligence . But she has n't a drop of malice anywhere in her . She genuinely wants to help people . She 's a kind of saint , an unsubtlesaint . The other day , reading the Confessions of St. Augustine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , Eileen is n't in the least subtle , like your long-time-ago son . Perhaps it 's better for saints not to be burdened by subtleties . Eileen is free . Well , have I bored you enough ? I take my chances . All love , KaetchenP.S . The doorbell just rang . The bellboy , a wizened dwarf of sixty , has just handed me a letter from you . For once I have something more important to do than to write you . Love , K.On Tuesday morning Lowe went to Pier 57 to meet the Queen Mary . He had three friends on board : Mr. and Mrs. Aldridge , who were travelingfirst class , and Kurt Federn , who was traveling third . He had invitedAldridge , Sr. , but he had to go to Chicago on a business trip . He admitted that he really did n't want to see his son , that he dreaded what the interview might lead to , that his Boston doctor had cautioned him against excess of emotional strain . He asked Lowe to inform Vincent about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be betterthat they did not meet until he , Aldridge , Sr. , had acquired some controlover himself , a mastery which , he added grimly , might take a very long time . Lowe told him not to worry . He undertook to handle Vincent . At the pier , Lowe left a message at the third-class gangway for Federnto meet him under the letter F at customs . He then went to the first-class gangway to meet the bride and groom . Presently he saw the short stocky figure of Vincent Aldridge , III . Behind him , her hand on Vincent 's shoulder , he saw a wavering , emaciated figure which he didp230not at once recognize as Naomi 's . Vincent greeted Lowe ecstatically . He did not look in the least like a lace-jabot man . He was short , deepchested , with powerful arms and shoulders . He had the body of a professionalwrestler . Lowe took Naomi in his arms . Her body trembled . Her eyes seemed to be alone in her face . Her thin cheeks were crisscrossed with brown splotches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He would take her to Voisin for dinner . His mouth watered as he thought of what he would order for Naomi , as well as at the thought of what he would order for himself . Naomi spoke to him in German . The gleaming voice had gone sallow . As he held her in his arms , Lowe thought , " She is not alive . She has smelt death . " He could hardly make out what she was whispering to him . She was asking him to thank Vincent , since she could not , for having been so " edel " to her . She rested in Lowe 's arms as if in a cradle . Vincent was ebulliently apologetic . He had a fluting voice . " My dear , " he said to Lowe , " I tried everything to amuse this dear child . I trotted out all my jokes , all my best stories  --  as you know , I am madly amusing  --  but not once , not once , could I make her laugh . It made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't make the dear child laugh . " " Maybe it 's your German , " said Lowe over Naomi 's shoulder . " Maybe your jokes do n't translate into German ! " " That 's a canard . My German is impeccable . You 've often told me so . " They moved along in the crush toward customs . " But Naomi tells me you 've been angelic to her . She asked me to tell you . She is grateful . So am I. " Vincent was in high spirits , cheered up , perhaps , by the knowledge that he had done a good deed . " But what did you expect me to be ? Do n't you know that my manners are exquisite ? I know I look Neanderthalbut in sensibility I am the last word . In fact , in myself , single . handed , I am a panorama of evolution , from the primordial to the hyper- civilized . It 's quite a responsibility but I bear it lightly . It 's heaven to see you Kaetchen . Sheer heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he here ? " " He had to go to Chicago on business . " " What a relief ! God 's in His Heaven . All 's right with the world . "  |p231He  whispered , with a side glance at Naomi . " But she breaks my heart , that child . What will you do with her ? She 's gone , you know . Quite gone . I had a feeling  --  a feeling on the boat ... " " What ? " " That 's she 's no longer one of us . " " We 'll bring her back , " said Lowe with quiet confidence . " But I have another friend on the boat . Kurt Federn . " " I met almost everybody in the Verandah Bar . I did n't meet any young Federn . Is he my type ? " Lowe chuckled . " He 's not in your class . " " Is he convertible ? I 'm pretty good , you know , at proselytizing . " " I meant economically . He traveled steerage . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first class . But I did n't meet . . . " " Well , you will now . Here he is ! Naomi ! Look ! A surprise for you . A fellow Salzburger ! " Federn , blond and ruddy , came up to them , smiling . " Here , Kurt , congratulate the bride . And the groom , Mr. Vincent EdwardAldridge , the Third . " Federn was bewildered . Naomi shook hands with him , without surprise . " I think it 's too maddening , " said Vincent , " that we did n't meet on the boat . " " I regret , " said Federn . " Are you the son of the playwright Federn ? " " Yes . " " But I adore your father 's works . Simply adore them . Parallels SometimesCross . I implored Balanchine to make a ballet out of that . Would n't Ravel have written a marvelous score for it ? Divine . I'vethought of Stravinsky . What would you think of Stravinsky ? " Kurt , quite at sea , expressed a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 've got to get you through customs , " he said . " Later we can talk about Stravinsky . " Lowe took charge . He found that people fumbled about when therep232were immediate chores to do , just as they dallied with menus in restaurants . Customs proved not to be troublesome . Neither Kurt nor Naomihad more than a dufflebag apiece . Aldridge took somewhat longer . Lowe left Naomi with Federn and walked with Vincent to the letter A. While they were waiting for Vincent 's bags to be brought up , Lowe told him why his father had n't come to the boat . Vincent 's eyes narrowed . His affability vanished ; he became vindictive . " He 's a nasty hypocrite . He reeks with phony nostalgia for the happy days with Mother , but he was rude to Mother . He was overbearing with Mother . I 've never forgiven him for that . I never will . " Lowe knew that Vincent had adored his mother . There was a colored photograph of Augustus John 's painting of her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vincent was fond of recalling that when they went to parties together , he would stand beside her and proclaim : " Behold ! Beauty and the Beast ! " It amusd everybody . While the customsman prowled through his suitcases , Vincent muttered : " I 'm glad he knows . If he were n't so dense and self-centered , he 'd have known long ago . I hope I never see him again . I 'm moving out of his house at once . I 'll take a room at the Ambassador to be near you , Kaetchen . " " But I 'm going to Hollywood . I have to take Naomi . Also Kurt . I 've got to see Mary Kennicott . I 've got business for Stohl . " At the mention of Hollywood , Vincent was in ecstasy . " Oh , but how marvelous ! I 'm at loose ends . I 've always wanted to go to Hollywood . I 'll go with you . What fun ! What marvelous fun ! " The four of them presently found themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the new prospect ; he fluted along at a great rate . " I know that I 've been a washout as a bridegroom so far but continuingour honeymoon en quatre will release me . I am determined to make Naomi laugh . Just once I 've got to make her laugh . Then I 'll be able to say we 've had a happy marriage ! " At this Naomi smiled . Vincent was triumphant . He crowed . " You see ! You see ! Wo n't it be jolly ? Imagine ! The four of us travelingto California . Century to Chicago , then the Super Chief ! Through the great heartland of America . All that corn . All that wheat ! " " What will you do when you get there ? "  | " You know everybody everywhere , Kaetchen . Perhaps you can get me a job at one of the studios . " " But you have n't written anything . You 've got nothing to show . " " I 'll go in for asceticism . I 'll lock myself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ! " " I 've heard that before , " said Lowe . But he considered . When one of his protegees needed something , he instinctively began to improvise opportunities . " After all , they hire everybody . Why not you ? " " Why not . " " Stanley Grant may be able to do something for you . " " Stanley Grant , the playwright ? Is he a friend of yours ? " Lowe nodded wearily . " I might have known ! Of course he would be ! But I adore him . I adore his play . I went to see it three times . I liked it better each time . I raved about it in London . When do we leave ? I just ca n't stand it  --  till we leave ! " " I thought you were going to lock yourself in . " " I 'll lock myself in in Hollywood . " " The weather is far too pleasant . Still , Naomi is going to stay with the Grants . . . . " Vincent interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can he then , Grant , if I drop in to see my bride once in a while ? He ca n't , can he ? " Lowe chuckled . " He wo n't object . He 's very tolerant . And his wife is a darling . She loves you already for what you 've done . You have , you know , you scoundrel , in spite of yourself , performed a Mitzvah . " " What on earth 's that ? " " Tell him , Kurt . " Federn interpreted . " A good deed . " Vincent flushed with pleasure . " Have I ? Have I really ? What is it again , that lovely word ? " Lowe repeated it . He was constantly expanding the vocabularies of his pet goyim . Vincent was in ecstasy . " I love it . I 'll have a little medallion made  --  gold  --  with that wordp234engraved on it and wear it on my lapel . My Mitzvah medal . What do you think , Kaetchen ? " " I do n't advise you to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be caught dead in the Union Club . My father belongs toit . " He had a bright idea . " I 'll wear it when we call on the Grants . " " That wo n't be necessary . You 'll be welcomed with open arms . " Vincent blew a kiss to the world at large . " Marvelous ! Vistas open . Is n't life wonderful ? Is n't it full of surprises ? You have married me right into the family of my favorite playwright . And with his influence , surely he can get me a job at one of those dear studios . Surely he can , do n't you think so ? " " If he really tries he might . He 's very self-centered . " " Ca n't you induce him to do a Mitzvah ? Ca n't you tempt him to outMitzvahme ? " Lowe laughed . Kurt and Naomi had n't the faintest idea of what was going on but they smiled on general principles . Lowe spoke to Federn . " You , Kurt , are a miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naomi is a full-fledged citizen of this great republic ? " Vincent reached across Lowe and put his hand on Naomi 's . " Citizen Naomi ! Dear Citizen Naomi ! " " You are kind , dear sir , you are very kind . " " Do n't , dear citizen , please do n't , you break my heart , " said Vincent . They had arrived at the modest hotel where Lowe had reserved rooms for Kurt and Naomi . Vincent kept the taxi . He undertook to arrange for the reservations to California . For once , Lowe yielded a prerogative usually exercised by himself . Vincent held the taxi door open to say a final word to Naomi . " Is n't it nice , sweet , that our honeymoon is n't over ? On the train , I promise  --  I 'll make you laugh ! " The Ian Leiths had arrived in Hollywood a week before . They had flown in from Honolulu . Eileen busied herself with scouting about for a place for the Leiths to live . She had found them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enchanted with it . She had never known the delights of living in a small house ; she told
