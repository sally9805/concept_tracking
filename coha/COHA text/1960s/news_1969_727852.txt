txt They are reading more books than ever , but film stirs them ever so much more . They have made poetry thrive ? as something to hear , rather than as something to read , They would rather create for themselves than have someone create for them . They are more passionate about intent than about form . They want art to function as either pure emotional pleasure or social tool . " They " are the American college students , whose tastes in the arts and literature today indicate possible sweeping cultural changes when " they " become tomorrow 's establishment . " They " is a generalization as sweeping as the scope of their extracurricular interests in books , music , film , theater , painting and sculpture . But an impression gained from a New York Times survey of students , teachers , booksellers , record sellers and others familiar with current cultural predilections on 10 campuses across the country indicates that college youth is getting its artistic kicks from things quite different from those that attracted students only five years ago . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything touching on black social problems ( " The Autobiography of Malcolm X " has for many months been a student best seller , with 100,000 paperback reprints being run off at almost monthly intervals ) to a passion for literature on the introspective ( Herman Hesse // has become a standard bookshelf item ) and arcane ( Harvard University 's Coop , a huge merchandising mart on Harvard Square , recently opened a paperback section for books on the occult ) . Film has become a staple pastime , as well as a source of primary artistic concern on the campus . Almost anything from old W. C. Fields to contemporary Michelangelo Antonioni to Hollywood spectacle is seen , not to mention the increasing thousands of films being made by students themselves . In some respects , it appears that film is a substitute of sorts for books of fiction in the story diet of many students . ' Music is a common background sound wherever students live , Very few do not either have record players or tape recorders . The taste , overwhelmingly , is for the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . However , a minority of students find that they can enjoy Bach , Mahler and traditional classics as well as hard rock . Although students are the main audiences for avantgarde , radical and audience participation theater , theater is not a cultural must for many college students . Many among the scores questioned indicated , however , that they like to see traditional theater professionally performed when they do go , even though Some prefer improvisational when they do it themselves . High prices , the need to dress up and the poor quality of performance ' in some out-of-town companies were often mentioned as deterrents . to theatergoing . Poetry is enjoying a popularity unknown even only several years ago , with such poets as Lawrence Ferlinghetti , E. E. Cummings , Allen Ginsberg among the favorites . But a City College English teacher quipped : " There 's more poetry being written than being read . " He did note , though , that poetry readings often draw full houses . Painting and sculpture are in evidence on many campuses but , except for those students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm for established works as for art created on campus . Commercials on TV For a generation reared on television , today 's college youth often voices contempt for TV , But not universally . Nearly all the students interviewed agreed that the commercials are the most imaginative offerings and many said that they look at old movies or at such series as " Star . Trek " or " Mission : Impossible . " ( Those two shows are in keeping with the popularity of science fiction , writing among students . ) " They are very visual minded , " said Dr. Robert Coles , a resident psychiatrist at Harvard Upiversity 's health services , who teaches . a course in which students examine social novels of the past . " I can flash a photo and it gets right to them . The visual is very important . Even conservative students have a struggle to find continuity between the real world and themselves . There is a whole tension , of feeling versus thinking . " " The question arises : " what is the purpose of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to see the truth . They say it is to mobilize , to portray degradation , to get people to take action . They 're turned on to certain things . I leave sometimes having been more culturally scrutinized by the students than I am by my patients . " They Do n't Look Back On the beautiful redwood campus of the University of California at Santa Cruz , overlooking incredibly blue Monterey Bay , Mrs. Beatrice Thompson , acting instructor in art , said , " They have no sense of looking back , they do n't want to know ? what 's been done ? I think for fear that they 'll see that someone else has done it . " " They all feel guilty that they do n't write creatively , " said Steven Weiland , a lecturer in the English department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor . " The kids ask if they can hand in a short story , rather that a critical paper . I know of one girl who wanted to dance her paper . " Those are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students phrase it differently . " I make movies , " said Michael Mason , a Boston College junior majoring in English literature . " You ca n't get a lot of things across in words . With film you can get to a person 's subjectivity . In class I 'm asked to react to a poem in writing , How am I supposed to put it into words ? I ca n't laugh or smile in print . In films you get it in a flash , You can get the history of art in four minutes . " " I used to read a lot before college , " said Brian Wenger , a 20-year-old sophomore at the City College of New York . " But I sort of got turned off . Film is the new media , I go to every movie I want to see , up to three times a week . " " Movies are cheaper than theater , " said Suzanne Lederer , a Hofstra University theater major who had just finished performing in " A Comedy of Errors " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would rather see a movie because they do n't have to think ? it 's like a big television set . " " I think the students see film as something quite . personal , as something to react against in Hollywood and on television , " said Marvin Felheim , an English professor at the University of Michigan , who also teaches a film course . Professor Felheim noted that there are two campus film societies at Aim Arbor , six commercial movie houses , including two new ones , two all-season drive-ins and a coffeehouse where films are shown . However , Jay Cantor and John Short , co-editors of The Harvard Crimson 's literary supplement , are not as quick to write the epitaph of the book . " Contrary to rumor and propagation by people in New York , literature is far from dead , " said Mr. Cantor . " A tremendous lot of fiction and poetry is being read , A movie takes up to two hours to see . It is more accessible than a book , which takes a certain amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read ? Bellows , Updike and Malamud , to name a few . And Torn Wolfe 's ' Electric KoolAid Acid Test ' ? a lot of people I know who read nothing else have read it , and it 's not even in paperback yet . " On the Book Front Taste in books is as wideranging as taste in film . Tides mentioned by students range from such classics as Dickens and Shakespeare to 16th-century French poets and to Hemingway and Thomas Wolfe and to such contemporary American novelists as Philip Roth . " Of course he 's writing about our grandmothers , " said a Brandeis undergraduate girl , who had read and enjoyed the devastating commentary on the Jewish mother , a perspective that put anyone over 35 in his proper place ) . Yet , general fiction is not one of the big categories of spare-time reading . Science fiction is extremely popular and authors who are most likely to be read by students include Arthur C. Clarke , Robert Heinlein , Isaac Asimov , Ray Bradbury and Rod Serling . Science fiction is often called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flights of fancy do not have a genesis in the test tube . At the Harvard Coop , one of the largest college stores in the country , more than a half-milion dollars ' worth of paperbacks is sold annually . While much of the buying is done for reading connected with courses , Arnold Swenson , the book director , and Roscoe Fitts , who manages the paperback division , find that pleasure reading shows no signs of diminution . " Generally , fiction is not what it was , unless it is fiction like Roth , " said Mr. Swenson . " Poetry sells and anything with a politically liberal point of view critical of the Establishment does well . " Mr. Fitts said that there had been an increase in interest on the occult , extrasensory perception , fortune telling , numerology and mind-expansion drugs in the last six months , enough to set up a new section that includes titles on witchcraft . Nearly a continent away stands the Bookshop on Pacific Street , the main stem of Santa Cruz . It is the opposite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bookshop is a small store with books heaped up on counters around which bearded young men and long-tressed girls thread their way . It is connected by a doorway to the Catalyst , a coffeehouse for the community started by the Consumers Cooperative of Santa Cruz . They are both part of an ancient hotel with a Spanish West Coast style lobby in which old men and women sit and stare at game shows on TV while guitars spin a ballad in the coffeeshop and Malcolm X and Frantz Fanon scowl from jacket covers in the bookstore . " Their reading hinges around everything that implies change , " said Ron Lau , the young Hawaiian , who runs the Bookshop , as he discussed the college customers . " We work with the Catalyst  --  we 've had talks by authors and rock ' n ' roll , jazz , classical guitarists , all on a modest scale . We even had a chamber music group come in  --  it 's a funny mix . " Mr. Lau is redesigning his store , cutting down space for government , Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less in demand . He is expanding his occult and astrology section and getting titles on health food  --  at one of the colleges at the nearby university , the students are served almost only health foods , by their own request , at the spacious cafeteria . A Distributor 's View Aaron Rabinovitz , partowner and sales manager of A and A Distributors , a Boston concern that is one of the largest distributors of paperbacks in the country , said that other categories popular among students included race relations , Vietnam and psychology . The market for " pornographic " books is also boundless , Mr. Rabinovitz said , adding : " We stay away from most of it except where it 's put out by reputable , established publishers such as Grove Press . " Books and film are for the eye , but music is for the ear , which never closes for rest as the eye does .

" Once in a while we get a young person in looking for an opera , but things have changed . On the other hand , we sell a great deal of sheet music , Beethoven and straight classics . Someone comes in to look for composers and they 'll buy Ravel and a Beetle book . Why they do it , I do n't know and I 've gone by the period of trying to figure it out . " " Even people who are interested in classical music and not in the Beatles music are interested in them personally , " said Mr. Cantor of the Harvard Crimson . " They are real cultural heroes and everyone wants to know what they 're doing , what drugs they 're taking , everything about them . And perhaps they feel even more intensely about Bob Dylan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no dearth of theater activity on campuses with many courses for students interested in acting , directing and play-writing . But the theater , as in the nonacademic world , does not appear to pervade the minds of students as extensively as poetry , film and music do . When the question of theater is brought up , it appears that almost everyone has gone to see what is available , but the comments are laconic and unenthusiastic . " What 's peculiar , even with students of theater , is that they have limited faith in the theater as a concurrent art form , " said Gordon Rogoff , writer and until recently a faculty member of the Yale School of Drama . " They rarely go to theater and it 's not because of money , even though this is what they say . They have enormous collections of records , which are not cheap . An evening with young theater people is likely to be a musical jigsaw with more talk on the esthetics of music and lyrics than on the esthetics of theater . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of whom said that they enjoyed a good performance of Shakespeare in the traditional style or would go to see " Jimmy Shine " or other Broadway shows when they appeared in road shows or when the students got to New York . There was a great division of opinion among those who had seen the Living Theater , with many saying they did not care for it at all . Painting and sculpture adorn campuses everywhere , but they are even less discussed than theater . Contrasted with the lack of discussion is the fact that art museums are often thronged by young people who sometimes seem to outnumber older visitors . Yet , most of the students interviewed expressed little enthusiasm for what they had seen . Morton Sacks is an artist and a teaching associate in art at Boston University . He also gives courses at Harvard . " They are not fools . They know something authentic when they see it but they are seduced by the quick , the present . Anyone who can express rage for them is good . They do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a scream and whoever screams loudest is best . " Fear of the Young " They have to get noncontemplative satisfaction , " he said . " But most of my most talented students do n't even feel it 's worthwhile to be an artist . " Ruth Whitman , a poet , who is Mr. Sacks 's wife and who was a poet in residence at the Radcliffe Institute , de-murred : " I think that these kids are terribly romantic . They have yearnings but wo n't admit to them . After all , rock poetry is the most romantic slush there is . Yet , poetry readings get such large attendance . It 's an age of spoken poetry . I teach a poetry workshop and students feel they can write poetry without reading it . That 's a fault . " " They 're aware of a lack of something , " said Mr. Sacks . " The students are brighter than ever , " said Mr. Sacks . " But they are reading mostly each other . I no longer get arguments . They ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people there is a desperate desire not to be understood , a fear of being plumbed . That is one of the reasons I 'm leaving teachMg . It 's just like the eroticism today ? they take their clothes off but show you nothing . " Related to the outlook on the arts , but indefinably so , is the use of drugs , a point brought up by some students at the University of Michigan . " Drugs let me step back and see old movies from other perspectives , " said a sophomore , who took drugs last year but has since given them up in favor of preoccupation with Oriental religion . " For me it was always a mixture of music and drugs . It affected the way I looked at the movie " Yellow Submarine . ' " Whether young people retain their current artistic and literary interests after 25 remains to be seen , but there is little doubt that by dint of numbers , income and upbringing they will be the cause of changes , some of them deep-rooted , in the accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Inc. , a company that specializes in business consultation directed at the youth market , says there are 40 million Americans between the ages of 14 and 24 , with a total income of $45-billion and influential hands on their parents ' wallets , containing another $135-billion . The New York Review Presentations , an offshoot of the New York Review of Books , widely read on campuses , has a thick booklet describing its offerings to colleges of speakers , films and music . It is an impressive roster from which one can choose anything from an , art critic to a panel of authorities on black aspirations . It is ample evidence that student interests are capable of being translated into cash symbols .
