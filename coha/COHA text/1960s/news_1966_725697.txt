txt Movie Mailbag pg . 98 Movie Mailbag Director De Sica Recalls Clift To THE EDITOR : I HAD the honor and pleasure to work with Montgomery Clift in a film entitled " Indiscretioris of an American Wife , " and so to know him well  --  intimately .. He was the most sensitive , intelligent actor I have ever known . He played his roles with a sense of poetry . I remember that he loved chil. dren ? and was himself one , who thrived on tenderness . But destiny became his enemy ; he who was worthy of goodness , of friendship and , above all , of happiness . From the time of that horrible auto accident , he never seemed to know peace . As the years passed , it became worse and worse for him . Finally , his heart could not contain the enormous desperation , and so it stopped beating . Now we are sadly without that fine actor who gave the world those wonderful and gratifying performances that will remain forever in our ? memory . Goodbye , Monty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rome . " WOOLF " HOWL To THE EDITOR . Well , I see the real professional actors are keeping quiet regarding " Virginia Woolf " lest they be relegated to the sour grapes committee . I , on the other hand , am one of the faceless crowd who stood in line in Wildwood , N. J. , to see this muchvaunted advance in American film making . Anonymity has given me the go-signal to pull the water seal on the barrel top . It has been three weeks since I saw the picture , and the wine of ray maturity has turned to vinegar . When I saw the stage version of " Virginia Woolf , " with Uta Hagen and Arthur " Hill , the Aristotelian catharsis was complete . I left the theater overwhelmed by the explosive truth of the drama , the power and substance of its language , and the incomparable acting of its cast . I thought then , as I think now , that " Virginia Woolf , " as a reflection of our frantic , self-searching , unhappy , and frightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary theater . What , then , " about the transference from stage to screen ? Among the yawning populace ( I wish I could say ' enthralled ' , but yawning they were in the Casino Theater , with the ' ho-hums ' so exaggerated that the surrounding moviegoers laughed ) I sat like a frozen-faced Zombie with those university brain fag blues . Bored to distraction , unable to thrum to the palpitating neuroses displayed in the drama by the hardworking actors , I found myself methodically isolating the curses , counting them like so many pieces of fringe on the edge of a summer awning . . . the four-letter words , then the five-seven-nine-eleven combinations . It started when Elizabeth Taylor , tearing a chicken bone apart with her teeth , began dropping the pieces all over her chin , rendering all the dialogue completely unintelligible except for " Bette Davis , " " What a dump , " and " God-damned . " From that point on , . I knew what to exexpect : unnatural naturalism . There was something grotesque about watching beautiful Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sex-starved bellowing rhinoceros , with a cleavage . She was striving for Truth , but somewhere along the line , her art became too personal and she began to superimpose her own neuroses on those of the character she was portraying ; The result , to me , despite the tears and the letting go of self , was undisciplined and superficial . On the other hand , there was the complete technician . Richard Burton is a more polished performer than his wife . His timing is good , his delivery incisive . But the sensitivity is lacking . There is a flint-like quality in this man , and it comes across on the screen . I could laugh at his sardonic barbs , but I could never sympathize with his despair . And George Segal , who to me was the most convincing , was still too knowledgeable , too tough for his role . He looked and acted like a young hood from " West Side Story . " Sandy Dennis ? Well , she was trying to work her way out of a method exercise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream . I think the use of Burton and Taylor ( or Taylor and Burton ) is great boxoffice. // But to pass their work off as great art is unthinkable . I would rather have seen Shelley Winters and Dirk Bogarde in those roles , especially if the midwestern prof is to have an English accent . Or to Americanize the film , how about Colleen Dewhurst and Shepperd , . Strudwick ? Or , to . make the circle complete , what 's the matter with Uta Hagen and- Arthur Hill ? Now I had been led to believe by the brain-washing technique , the trumpet blaring hurrahs of Time and Life magazines , that to have a negative view of this dynamic film would be ' to pull all artists a giant step backward to the time of Cotton Mather or Judge Hawthorne . No one wants to be called a square , and no thinking person wants to be accused of narrowmindedness or bigotry in regard to the artist 's right to express life as he sees , feels , knows and ? understands it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squaredom or the " lack of cool , " but whether or not " Virginia Woolf , " using the tools of its wonderful freedom , advances the craft of moviemaking as an expressive art form . I am inclined to say that in theory , it does , but in actuality , in practice , it does not , and that no matter how sincere the intelition of the film , ' the result is one of sensationalism. ? I object , for example , to the ' corny use of symbols : the full moon , the pulsating light signal of the parked station wagon , the blinding neon beams behind Miss Taylor , upstaging her for almost three minutes in one of her better scenes . It was as though the bad kid from " The Children 's Hour " were peeping through the keyhole and relaying the story to the village gossip . In a few years , my children will be able to see this film without the presence of an adult chaperone . I can not say what . deeper insight into life and living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do know two lessons they will have learned from the film , just as their doddering matriarch did , which ought to help them through their searching , seeking university days . First : that you can mix J &B; Scotch and Beefeater : Gin all night long , and never die . And second : that you can raise , hell in a roadhouse , beat drums , cymbals , and scream , and even get strangled , if you so ? desire , and then have the owner come in before the last gasp and politely inquire , as he wipes his hands on a clean apron : " Is there anything I can get you , folks ? " So , for this . swinging bit of truth ? let us be grateful . Gaudeamus Igitur ! DOLLY BEECHMAN . Westmont , N. J.
