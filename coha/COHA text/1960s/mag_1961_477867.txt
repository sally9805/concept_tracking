An American expert , sent there by the UN , tells how the Russians are running into plenty of trouble in their efforts to set up a Communist society in the jungle . wHO goes to Guinea ? Not many Ameri- cans certainly . Last year there were perhaps twenty on the Embassy and Information Service staff , forty teachers , a dozen or so missionaries , and about three businessmen . I was the only American sent there by the United Nations . One clay in the fall of 1959 I was talking to a UN recruiter in Portland , Oregon , trying to think of likely prospects for the engineers and foresters he was seeking for a number of missions . When he discovered I had some knowledge of French , he whipped out a job description in French and asked me to read it to him . It covered the terms of a one-year contract for a forestry post in the new Republic of Guinea . As there are not many American foresters who know French and even fewer interested in overseas work . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been to Yugoslavia on a similar mission for the FAO , and my wife and 1 had enjoyed it immensely . So there was little question about our accepting this time . Guinea ? about the size of Arizona ? is located on the Atlantic coast at the southwest corner of the western bulge of Africa . Until October 1958 , when it became independent , it was part of French West Africa . The abrupt departure of the French officials and the apparent unwilling . ness of the Western countries to step in left the new president , Sekou Toure , dangling and he turned to the Communist bloc for help . After a couple of days ' briefing at UN headquarters in New York , I boarded a plane for Conakry , the capital . While I went on ahead to find suitable housing , my wife and son had nothing to do but put everything in storage , sublet our house , buy tropical wardrobes , change our magazine subscriptions , shut off the milk and the telephone , and a few dozen similar chores . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Conakry morning hit me like a blow . I felt worse as I neared the airport buildings and saw soldiers everywhere , with burp-guns cradled in their arms . It was a couple of days before I noticed there were no dips in the guns . A couple of hundred Guinean women crowded around the airport , laughing , singing , skipping through ( lance steps , all of them clothed in brilliant , harmonizing colors . The Canadian UN officer who collected me told me I had picked the wrong day to arrive ? President Sukarno and a large Indonesian delegation were due that morning and all outbound traffic on the main road had been stopped . He invited me to have coffee while we waited for the official UN car . The demitasse of stout black brew demanded sugar , which came in large rough cubes . My new friend explained that it was Russian sugar and practically insoluble . If you put it on a string , you could use it in a dozen cups of coffee without softening it , and if you threw it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would blow a tire . While I looked for an apartment , I stayed at the Hotel de France , far and away the best hotel in Conakry . It gets the sea breeze from two sides of the peninsula and so is remarkably free from the dust and flying insects that plague the rest of the city . But it did have its quota of wildlife . Large shiny brown cockroaches lived in the bathroom drains . Tiny ants trailed the floors and walls and ceilings searching for tidbits . One night I smashed a large , furry tan spider by throwing a French whodunit at it ; the next morning there was n't a trace of him ? the ants and roaches had done their job . .1-he bread served at the hotel was rich in this kind of protein , too , but after a few days I relaxed and contented myself with removing only the more obvious of the insects baked into it . DONE IN BY BANANAS T H E job the UN sent me to fill was Joint Chief of the Rivers and Forest Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guinean chief in administration and training . I had been in Guinea only five days when I was sent on a trip to Manion in the interior to attend an international conference on land management and soil and water conservation . Besides me ? the only American ? there were two Portuguese from their Guinea , Frenchmen representing Mali and Dahomey , British technicians representing Sierre Leone and Nigeria , a Dutchman working for Nigeria , several French and Belgians working with the commission which organized the meeting , and a dozen or so Guineans . After a couple of days of meetings , we loaded into cars and jeeps for a tour through the mountains to see some of the problem areas . In the mountain villages , with their circular clay houses and conical thatched roofs , patches of vegetables and rows of banana , papaya , and coffee trees are planted around the huts , and chickens are everywhere . The coffee is about the only cash crop . On the hillsides , where the thick forest has been felled and burned , mountain rice and fonio are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enclosures where the plantings are fertilized with animal manures , can cultivation be continued more than a few years . The villages are simply moved from time to time . The cattle , a small odd-looking breed called N'Dama ? the only cattle resistant to sleeping sickness ? represent the measure of family wealth . They are milked but seldom slaughtered and they have badly overgrazed the grasslands and even caused deterioration in forest areas . Goats and sheep increase the damage to vegetation and soil . We saw demonstration farms planted to special varieties of rice , citrus and avocado trees , and citronella grass , and visited the famous Chevalier botanical garden established fifty years ago , with fine plantations of pine trees from Mexico and Burma . We also saw the Strophantus shrub , whose berries were the source of a curarelike poison used on arrows in past times ; now it is a respectable medical drug and potentially a good export crop for Guinea . On our return trip we stopped near Kindia to visit the French Institute agricultural station with its pilot factories for making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laboratories for studying diseases of pineapple and banana , and test plantings of rice , mangoes , and avocados . The Guinean banana is small and green and not very attractive to one brought up on the large yellow Central American fruits , but it is sweet and tasty . It is one of Guinea 's principal exports , but the volume exported has fallen off about 80 per cent in recent years because of disease and lack of plantation care . The disease can be readily controlled by aerial spray but the Guineans who have taken over the plantations from the former French owners have not been good managers and have not felt they could afford to spray by airplane . The yield is down and many of the bantioires are rapidly going back to the jungle . Though the banana has furnished an export crop , it has increased the agricultural problems of the country . Banana groves , which require rich soil and plenty of moisture , occupy the bottom land along the streams . The only other soils with much fertility lie on steep mountainsides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheiks to make the bananiives , the native agriculture was forced up onto the slopes . Under the heavy rainfall of the area , from 80 to 200 inches within five months of the year , the soils leach and erode rapidly when trees are cleared off to plant rice and fonio . The government is doing some replanting of forest , but not more than 3,000 acres per year , which does n't even keep up with current losses . As long as the farmers must cultivate steep slopes , there are better ways of doing it , but , with 1.5 million acres in bad condition , the growing job of erosion control and reforestation and land rehabilitation is tremendous and becomes greater every day . It took me about three weeks to find an apartment . I moved in , hired a Malinke " boy-cuisine " named Sory , and cabled my wife and son to come running . Guinea includes five major tribes ? the coastal Soussnu , the rnontain Fula , the interior Malinke and Kissi , and the northern Bagga groups . Each has its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. Forest Service , W. E. Bullard is now working with a Public Health Service team studying the Columbia River basin water resources . He is fond of fishing , photography , stamps , hi-f , and science fiction . The Malinke are the blackest of the black and fairly big people . The Fula , who are lighter and smaller and finer-featured , with many Arabic rather than Negroid physical traits , arc said to be relatively recent immigrants from the north . I was told that the Guineans are nearly all Moslem , though not as strict as the Arabs . Our apartment was on the top floor , five flights up . but I was told it would have more breeze and fewer mosquitoes . The repainting and sealing for the air conditioner were still going on when my wife and son arrived . My wife got her introduction to African ways watching the painter paint the door into the bedroom . The job took him three days . Then he put in a week painting the tiny terrace . Perhaps he liked our company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys who were amused by my son 's efforts to catch the lizards in the courtyard . Using my fly rod and barbless hooks , he accumulated a menagerie of lizards in little screen cages on our balcony . There were two species , little brown skinks and big redheads . My son was a member of the Philadelphia Herpetological Society and at the request of members he eventually sent about three dozen lizards to the States by airmail in perforated coffee cans . Despite the five-story elevation , mosquitoes and midges and flying cockroaches swarmed into our apartment until my wife hung yards of netting over the louvered shutters , which helped to slow them down a little . Within a week the netting was red with dust . In spite of Sory 's best efforts at the laundry tubs , our white tropical clothes were reddish as long as we were in Guinea . Some of the other wildlife was more noxious . While visiting the local branch of the Pasteur Institute near Kindia , I found nut that the spitting cobras , along with the Galloon vipers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were there a boy about fourteen years old pedaled in on his bicycle with five green mambas in a cage over the rear wheel . Since the Institute pays 2.000 francs apiece for these snakes , this wealthy young entrepreneur probably supports two dozen relatives on his earnings . He leads an exciting life , but it may not be a long one ; the fast-acting mamba poison can cause death within ten minutes . Anti-venom for cobra and viper bites is available in first-aid stations in many villages , but not for mamba bites since victims would die before they could get there . Newcomers to Guinea usually come down with the African trots within three weeks , but after a few days ' dosing with tummy pills , one gradually becomes more or less immune . But our son did n't improve with this home treatment . After several days I called in a Czech doctor recommended by my forestry counterpart . His verdict was an acute staph or strep infection of the intestines and his prescription stopped the trouble within two hours . It is difficult to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem was offered by a Guinean who came to my office with a baby genette for sale . This little animal resembled a slim spotted raccoon and I was assured it would tame easily , make a nice house pet , and grow to be no larger than a cat . When I took it out of my pocket , where it was sleeping peacefully , my son smiled for the first time in a couple of weeks . They were soon inseparable and when we left Guinea , " Marmot " canoe home with us . ERASED FROM THE PLAN T H E much-touted Plan Triennal , or Three Year Plan , that was to solve gloriously all of Guinea 's problems was to begin July 1 , 1960. ushering in the golden era , with large sums of money for all sorts of projects . Although more than half of the budget was for bigger and better government buildings , our chief for conservation had been able to include some forest planning and the building of a sawmill . Late in August , about five million francs were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out again to Mamou to work with the district agriculture and forestry officers on plans . We picked up our project where the French had left off at the time of Independence . Since then , streamflow and rainfall records had been kept in the watershed area ? that was all . We made few changes in the original project plan ; only some increases in crop planting to produce more food for the local people and their livestock . Most of our effort was devoted to determining and scheduling the work , estimating the amount and cost of the labor , and allocating money From the meager budget to get it done . Three weeks after 1 returned , I learned that funds had suddenly been withdrawn . Also that the Guinean project director was being sent to Israel on a six-months scholarship to study soilconservation methods there while the sorely needed work at home was let go . At about the same time , I learned that the first soil and land-use survey strongly recommended by the Mamou Conference and accepted at that time by the Guineans was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in July an item to cover Guinea 's share of the costs ( less than half the total ) , but in September it was cut out because of a shortage of funds . Since the country was operating on a printing-press currency , I could n't understand this argument . Nor ( lid I believe it , for none of the plans for new government office buildings were dropped . By October a small office building for the Ministry of Production was built , and the site was prepared For the President 's new palace . Meanwhile , a Czech forester sent by Polytechna. their technical assistance agency , was planning the sawmill for the southeastern part of the country in the last large remaining area ? about 65,000 acres ? of gnod tropical forest timber . On his first trip down there he ( lid a bit of timber cruising on the most accessible part of the area . The forest was about sixty miles from the nearest town of any size , N'Zerekore , and connected with it by a barely passable road . He recommended first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey , then the building of good truck roads , and finally the mill . - A team of Russian expediters was then assigned to help him make the proper choices on sawmill equipment and to advise on location and layout . Though they were supposedly economists and plant engineers , their first move was to ask the government officials where they wanted the sawmill to be put . The answer was N'Zerekore . Then they asked what kind of mill was wanted ; the answer was " electric . " The Czech forester pointed out that there was no electricity closer than about 200 miles from N'Zerekore , and that a small portable mill located in the forest work area would be more economic . He was overruled . The mill would be electric and would be located in N'Zerekore . A generating plant would he built to supply both the mill and the town with electricity . But the first order of business was to build the mill , and he was told to determine the best equipment to get . He finally settled on French equipment designed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international incident by refusing to okay the purchase of Russian equipment , pointing out that it was n't designed for the situation in Guinea and would be a waste of money . The Guinean officials finally agreed , but remained neutral in the discussions . One Guinean later told him on the side that he understood the arguments and quite agreed , but that he did n't dare appear to oppose the Russians because his president had just gotten a big loan from Russia . The Russian advisers went back into the interior for a few weeks more , purportedly forfurther " expediting . " However , their interpreter did manage to collect plenty of material for dictionaries of Soussou and Malink6 . The rest of the team was collecting all sorts of data on the resources and economy of the country . These were the only Russians I met there . However , I met many Czechs ? teachers , doctors , radio and aviation technicians : " I liked them al/ . Possibly my opinion of them is colored by the fact that it was a Czech doctor who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they appeared to be well-trained and competent , and I never heard them discuss politics , local or otherwise . I did not meet any of their secret police agents who were said to be responsible for beatings and murders of Guineans arrested for political deviation . Nor did I want to . In October Air Guinea began furnishing air service to the interior , using a fleet of four Russian two-engined planes , operated by Czechs . There were one or two other tangible evidences of Russian or Russian-backed assistance to Guinea : A powerful radio station to reach all of West Africa was being built in Conakry ; also a huge printing plant . Czech and East German merchandise gradually came in to replace French imports but was not of comparable quality in most instances . I did not see nor did any of my acquaintances see the much-publicized Russianbuilt roads . WHERE CAVIAR GOES BEGGING I N September we rented a house with a garden and beach front on the north side of the peninsula , at the end of " Ambassador Row , " with the Texaco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager on the other . A week later our shipment of household goods from the States , for which we had been waiting four months , finally arrived . Life in the new house was pleasant and comfortable . The Guineans , however , did n't have it so nice . Diet for most Guineans is based on rice and manioc. peppers , chicken , and mutton . The people were neither interested in nor able to afford the canned Russian caviar , crabmeat , and fowl that were unloaded in the government stores . Only the foreigners benefited from these things and from the vodka , Polish cheese and butter , Czech canned ham , Hungarian Tokay wine , and Czech and German beer , all very good . Even had the Guineans been able to afford imports , their currency had no foreign exchange value . The regular supply of fruits and vegetables diminished during the rainy season and a lot of people were hungry by October . Our neighborhood , including our house , had seven food burglaries in two nights . Signs of the time , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady procession , three or four times a day , asking for work . A shipload of rice from the United States and another from Vietnam temporarily solved the food problem , but the government had to send the army to guard the distribution centers and control the crowds . The currency reform in Guinea happened only a short time before I got there . Originally Guinea used the French African Community franc rated at about 245 to the dollar . When the paper Guinean franc was introduced itk value was declared by the government to he equal to that of the CFA franc . All other money was called in and exchanged at the government bank . The government 's issuance of its own money was a matter of pride , made without the knowledge of the Guinean Minister of Finance or his UN finance adviser . It led to a more than creeping inflation and persuaded many of the French who had stayed on after Independence to get out . The banks , like other government and important business offices , were full of clerks wearing gold-rimmed spectacles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd ? though the spectacles often did not have lenses . Among the common herd the badge of higher caste was the motorbike . It did n't seem to matter whether the motor worked or not , and most of them did n't . SMUGGLING THE COLD WAR T 11 F three American and one French oil companies serving Guinea had their share of difficulties . At the beginning of the year they were asked if they would accept oil and gasoline from Russian tankers . They reluctantly agreed . Soon they were being told that more tankers would be coming in and the company tanksshould be ready for them . When the company people objected , the government asked them if they wanted to be accused of sabotage . For a while they were even looking for beer bottles in which to store their own product . Since Independence the companies had not been paid by the government for the oil and gas it ordered ; their only local revenue was from sales at their service stations and these barely covered operating costs . Expecting nationalization at any moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time the port of Conakry would be closed when Iron Curtain ships were in . A French friend of mine on one occasion saw cases of arms being unloaded from a Russian ship . These arms were being shipped to Mali but it was fairly common knowledge that they were destined for Algeria and the rebels , to go from Conakry to Kankan by rail , thence to Bamako in Mali by truck , and then north across the Sahara , perhaps by camel . The government regularly called meetings of all its workers to discuss all sorts of problems , only rarely its own . At least one day every two weeks would be lost to discussions of the situation in Algeria , or Angola , or South Africa ; anywhere but in Guinea . Resolutions adopted at these meetings were read over the local radio and published in the Bulletin Quotidian , a mimeographed Ministry of Information booklet which was Guinea 's only daily newspaper . It carried all the official gospel according to the Party . The government had two main problems with its people : unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet these problems , much more went into trying to divert the people 's attention . The infamous " c.omplot " business in April 1960 was an example . One government officer , an honest conservative , suggested to the top Party people that to be truly democratic Guinea should have two parties , explaining that there might be different ways to attain the public good . The Party officials professed interest in the idea , questioned him at length , found out with whom he had discussed his idea , and the next day ordered the arrest of all concerned . Mighty blasts went out over the radio accusing the French of directing a plot to overthrow the government and the neighboring states of Mali and the Ivory Coast of helping in it , The man who had openly approached the government spent a couple of weeks in jail and then was beaten to death . Word got around that the Czech secret police had a hand in the beatings , but the government blandly announced that the man had died of " heart failure . " Check points were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find arms smuggled by the " cornplot . " Harassment of the French increased ; sound trucks harangued the people to be alert for deviationists . In Conakry , we were heartsick . This was the work of the government headed by that personable politician , Sekou Tour ? . We met President Toure at a reception at die Liberian Ambassador 's home . A friendly and charming man with a pleasing personality , he was also a firm believer in pomp and circumstance ; wherever his Cadillac went it was accompanied by twenty white-uniformed soldiers on motorcycles with sirens wailing . And where he stopped there was always a band to play the national anthem . Then in July the Congo erupted . When the UN decided to send a force to the Congo , Guinea demanded that some of her troops be included . The planes loaned to the UN by the United States arrived at Conakry airport to pick up the Guinean contingent , and several Guinean politicos put on soldier suits and climbed aboard with the troops . What they did in the Congo was to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UN . With this change in attitude , down went the official rating of the UN in Guinea . Soon the president and other high officials left the country for a world tour that included Djakarta , Peking , Moscow , the UN headquarters , and Havana . Since the government had been reorganized with control tightly held at the top , it was necessary to see the president if you wanted action on any matter . In his absence , the wheels of government ceased to turn and nothing could be accomplished . Holidays and parades were called for all sorts of visitors , which included while I was there President Sukarno of Indonesia , King Hussein of Jordan , and President Tubman of Liberia . Lumumba 's brief visit en route home from the UN special session in the summer of 1960 served as an occasion for further blasts against the UN and the Western nations , imperialistic : colonialists all . The Chinese came to Guinea a little later than others of the Communist bloc , but they came in quantity . They worked as advisers in rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise they kept very much to themselves . Only the Ambassador and his wife attended the dipinmatic receptions . I heard that the Guineans did not like them because they refused to mix . Although official treatment of the Russians was a little short of royal , I doubt that they had much effect on most of the people . As Eastern bloc imports replaced the French and other Western goods , complaints increased . In spite of the glowing promises of aid made by the Russians , in spite of the constant propaganda barrage in their favor by the controlled radio , it was a couple of little things , and one big thing , which prevented their acceptance . Russian and other Iron Curtain matches would n't light ; other makes were n't available . Czech shoes of very poor quality flooded the market . East German fabrics were shoddy and not color-fast . Since these things were all that the mass of the people could buy , they remarked regularly that " it was better when the French were here . " Most resented , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that they showed the race prejudices they accused others of . Guinean visitors to Russia returned unconvinced ; letters from Guinean students there were unhappy . The government was at times rather hard on its own people and often drew the same " Oh , for the good old days " reaction . Arrests and heavy fines for minor infractions of traffic rules , for being out after curfew , or for making remarks about government officials were common . Guinea was trying to be a police state in the best Party tradition . The men , the arms , the numerous restrictions , the organizations were there for the most vicious type of control . That it failed of attainment is probably due to Guinea 's unexcelled record of incompetence in government . Several of her leaders were trained in Party schools , but training in sabotage and revolution is not training in organization and administration . They swindled their people into independence , and now seem busy trying to swindle them into slavery . HOW MANY BALLPOINTS ? T H E people of Guinea deserve better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They work exceedingly hard to scratch a living from their poor land ; they like to relax and enjoy themselves as much as anyone else . Though they differentiate the things of importance to them from what they call the " affairs of the whites " ? which include most governmental affairs ? they are not lazy . It may take some generations to convert them to modern technology , but their way of life has values for them , and they in turn have values for the community of man . Perhaps one of the difficulties with the government of Guinea is the fact that Santa Claus is on every hand . No matter which way they turn , someone is there to give them a handout . I can not believe that this helps any people develop self-reliance , or that it produces feelings of gratitude in them . Pride and sensitivity and " face " may mean a little more to them than immediate answers to their material needs . I watched a number of organizations furnishing aid of various kinds to Guinea . The UN , America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polytechna organization , and agencies of several other governments poured money and goods and people into the country . The Iron Curtain countries sent machinery ? trucks , tractors , cars , airplanes , arms . They organized the Party and the youth . The Czechs ran the airline within the country , and added Guinea to their own international schedule . The Poles ran the port . The East Germans were building a radio and printing plant . The Bulgarians helped with the Youth Movement . The Chinese helped get more land into rice production . The organization work done by the Iron Curtain bloc was effective . Primary and high-school students were subject to military drills and classes in the Party brand of civics . Older youth provided a work corps for various public projects . Villages were assessed a labor quota for public projects in the village areas . These assessments were voted unanimously at party meetings in the villages where attendance was a privilege of Guinean citizenship . It was also comoulsory , Technical assistance was furnished by several countries individually as well as by the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the EnOish-language teaching programs appeared to he well received . A group of Stateside college students came over during the summer to work with the Guinean labor corps on public projects . This , too , was well received . Generally , it seemed that good use was made of the teachers and the medical people , wherever they came from , despite shortages of supplies and crazy irregularities . Our Czech doctor friend had his own clinic with three modern operating-rooms , and he was training three Guinean doctors . But a refrigerated shipment of drugs was left in the sun for three days at Conakry airport before he was notified , and most of it was lost . For the schools there was a warehouse full of ballpoint pens , enough to equip each student with one per week for several years , but books and paper were short . The U.S. Information Service , which had a fairly large library in English and in French , carried about two dozen American magazines , and the overseas editions of the New York newspapers . The library was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and papers . I was asked to prepare some lessons in forestry and soil conservation for grammar and high-school students . My colleagues at home responded magnificently to my requests for reference materials , and with the help of one of the US/S teachers I completed and translated three series . What attracted the Guineans most were the Smokey Bear and Mark Trail " comic books " and the gay conservation posters in color sent me by the U. S. Forest Service and U. S. Soil Conservation Service . Under the UN Technical Assistance program about a dozen experts in finance , meteorology , hydrology , rice culture , public health , statistics , geology , and forestry were furnished to the Guinean government . Though the government officially expressed gratitude for this help , it did not make much use of it . I got the impression during my seven-month stay that they liked to have the UN people there just to push around . For example , the finance expert tried vainly to get an appointment with the ministry officials with whom he was supposed to work . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were going to make the promised finance expert available . The Minister was informed that the expert had been occupying an office in the ministry , and had been trying to see him for three months , but even after this , the expert was not given anything to do . Eventually he was released from his contract after seven months of boredom . The Ministry of Public Health seemed to be the only branch of the government that was seriously interested in getting more experts in to help . As the Congo business dragged on and got worse , the official attitude toward the UN became less and less good . Invitations to the UN staff to attend official functions dropped off practically to zero . The Resident Representative was called upon only to receive blunt demands and to deliver reprimands to headquarters . In 1959 , UN Day , October 24th , had been a gala holiday in Guinea . In 1960 the Resident Representative received a curt note from the government saying that because of the UN 's imperialistic repression of their brothers in the Congo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y contract called for me to work primarily in training the Guineans in administrative procedures . This was something sorely needed , as before Independence they had had little or no such training . They refused , however , to let me do it , saying that they had changed their policy . They said they were glad to have me as a consultant , but even in that capacity called on me only 20 per cent of the time . The first couple of months I was able to make my own work but soon ran out of that . I. too , became bored and wanted to get out . The French officials formerly in charge had outlined many excellent projects in forestry and land management ; there was little I could add other than my blessing . And little I could do beyond giving a push now and then and instilling- some confidence into the Guineans . It was n't long before the government began negotiations with the UN office to have inc re placed . It took two months for the news to reach me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred in about two weeks , and then came orders to leave Guinea by the end of the month . It was clear that I was not being transferred , but " included out .

However , I was heartened by the fact that UN offered me two other missions . It was hard for me to say good-by to my associates in the Rivers and Forests Service ; I had developed a real affection for them all . Our farewell to Sory was emotion-packed . He had become practically a member of the family . When we left for the airport , Sory gave me an envelope addressed simply " Mon Patron . " Inside was a note laboriously scrawled in French , thanking us For our kindness to him and wishing us a pleasant trip home . Illiterate himself , he had paid a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to letters that I have received from Guinea since my return , the UN is finished there , too . On nbruary 22 , 1961 , the government ordered the Resident Representative and his staff out of the country .

A geologist on the staff , away from Conakry at the time of the expulsion order , was promptly arrested on his return for " resisting government orders " but was released the next day . It took him four days to get reservations on the airlines for himself and his family , and the government would not permit him to convert any of his Guinean francs to a currency useful elsewhere . The final and most unexpected occurrence in this confused tragicomedy was the delivery of a notice of deposit of several hundred thousand francs in the government bank .
