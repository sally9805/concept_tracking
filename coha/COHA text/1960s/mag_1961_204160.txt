In barren little Jordan , two-thirds of King Hussein 's 1,600,000 subjects are Palestinian refugees who hold no love for the desert-born Hashemite dynasty . Half a million live in filthy camps and are grimly called " the King 's immortal guests " because , to get more food rations , they register births but never admit to any deaths . They are fierce Arab nationalists , who tune in on Cairo 's Voice of the Arabs and can stage a nasty riot . Last week Hussein risked their displeasure and defied his own royal relatives by taking a British bride . <P> Relief from Cares . In the three weeks since Hussein 's surprise engagement announcement , his Cabinet and the strong-minded Queen Mother Zain had tried hard to talk him out of the idea . Not that anybody objected to the girl personally . At 20 , Toni Avril Gardiner is modestly pretty , modestly sized ( 4 in. shorter than Hussein 's 5 ft. 6 in. ) , modestly educated ( like Hussein , she never went to college ) - in many ways a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was taller , seven years older , and holder of an M.A. from Cambridge . Hussein got to know Toni at go-cart races in Amman , and both are fond of fast cars , planes and dancing . " Toni , " said a friend , " is not very anything . She 's a simple , gay girl who will cha-cha-cha with him when the day 's state cares are over . " <P> But she is British , daughter of the British lieutenant colonel who is Hussein 's anti-bomb officer . And British influence in Jordan has been a sensitive issue to Arabs ever since Winston Churchill created Jordan after World War I and handed it to the Hashemites . Hussein 's Cabinet and Queen Zain flatly refused to okay the marriage . Stubbornly , a smitten Hussein threatened to abdicate in favor of his neurotic younger brother Mohammed . The Cabinet preferred even Toni to Mohammed , but still threatened to resign if the marriage went through . Finally Hussein made a concession : his bride would not be Queen , but " shall be called Muna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or position . " Gratefully , Premier Bahjat Talhouni declared that his soul was filled with admiration for " the partner of your life who shares with you indifference to title or position . " <P> Gift from Cairo . To appease enemies and critics , Hussein released 600 short-term prisoners , slashed other sentences by a third , and commuted all death sentences to life imprisonment . He even visited Amman Central Prison , released and embraced a onetime aide convicted of plotting . In a cream-colored Rolls-Royce prudently surrounded by a cordon of armored cars , the King stopped off at the Grand Hussein Mosque for lengthy prayers . He promised elections " soon , " though one Jordanian predicted that they would result in a " 75% pro-Nasser Parliament . " <P> The ceremony itself was simple . In a salon at his mother 's modest palace , Hussein and Toni ( who has been converted to the Moslem faith ) said their vows , signed five copies of the wedding contract , exchanged rings , and then everybody in the room shouted " Mabrouk ! " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hussein drove through Amman 's streets in a cream-colored Mercedes to take the cheers of most of the city 's population . That night the couple retired to one of Hussein 's palaces , Basman , where they had the company of two pet lions .
