txt Letters to The Times Cogen Defends Striking Federation Head Warns Teachers Will Fight Strike Law TO THE EDITOR OFTHE New YORK Times : Your editorial of April 9 " Mr. Cogen 's Contempt of Law " is an effective presentation of a point of view critical of my recent statements on the intentions of the United Federation of Teachers vas-A-vis the Condon-Wadlin anti-strike law . Allow me to present the other side of the controversy , I begin with the proposition that education in New York City , as in the United States generally , is in a desperately sick condition . All the authorities have been telling us this for some time now . Note the evaluation by Representative Mark C , Schinnerer , quoted in the Same issue as your editorial : " The real frontier of America is the slums of the great cities , and education is the key to the solution . If something is n't done about this , it will kill us . It does n't work as fast as the nuclear bomb , but it is , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is determined , insofar as it is within our power , not to allow the negligence of politicians to kill us . We must make a real breakthrough in our laggard school system . If the politicians are neglectful of their obvious duty , we must dramatize the situation , by strike if necessary . The strike is used by us only as a weapon of last resort , in situations of extreme urgency involving a moral issue . Furthermore , only our membership can call a strike or call it off . It follows that if an injunction were to be issued , only the membership could decide whether to obey it and go back to work . Tradition of Resistance Your editorial stresses the side of unquestioning obedience to the law . But historically there has always been another side to the American democratic spirit . It is the side that was evidenced in our nation 's struggle for independence and has always been alive ' in our traditions . In the 1930 's it was practiced in the sit-in strikes , and currently it is epitomized by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governmental action . This is the side of individual liberty , asserted even against the Government when the latter is repressive . Each man must decide for himself where the balance lies between law and order on the one hand and resistance to undemocratic government on the other . The U.F.T. shall never deviate from its position that the prohibition of strikes is unfair , unjust and totalitarian . As in many other cases in history , we expect to establish our position and make it the accepted one by our militant fight in its behalf . In this we shall be setting a good example for our students . Civic courage and idealism should be practiced by those who teach it . CHARLES COGEN , President , United Federation of Teachers , Local 2 . New York , April 10 , 1963 . More Skyscrapers Protested To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : If , as a Times story pointed out on April 4 , city planners were dismayed by congestion in the Grand Central area long before the Pan Am Building was started , and if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site of the Grand Central Palace , why are these buildings permitted ? Must the city administration stand by while real estate operators make Manhattan an increasingly disagreeable place ? Should not the public weal take precedence over private interests in this case ? RICHARD STARKEY . New York , April 4 , 1963 . Not All Featherbedding To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your April 4 editorial " End of the Featherbed ? " does not give a fair appraisal of the subject . The majority of railroad employes recognize that some changes in working schedules are in order due to technological changes and the need for meeting competition , but they are against the sweeping demands of the railroads . They are upset by the propaganda and false advertising carried on by the Association of American Railroads . Many of the conditions cited as featherbedding were negotiated across the table over 40 years ago . Some of the provisions were set up as penalties to overcome abuses by management . The advantages that accrue to employes through some provisions of the present agreement are offset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sundays and holidays without additional compensation . Workers are required to pay all expenses away from home for meals and lodging . There are locations and conditions in which a yard or freight diesel can efficiently operate with one man . But to operate with one man 10-diesel locomotive units with a combined rating of 15,000 to 20,000 horsepower handling 100 or more cars at speeds in excess of 60 m.p.h , where the stopping distance may be over a mile is not in the interest of safety and efficiency . The long stopping distance with heavy high-speed freight trains necessitates acute awareness , and the hazards involved warrant a second competent man in the cab to check observations . GEORGE L. BRADEN . San Francisco , April 6 , 1963 . Australian Aid Denied Ambassador Explains All Military Equipment Is Paid For To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : On page 8 of The News of the Week in Review in the New York Times of April 7 you published a map in which Australia was shown as receiving " direct aid " ( economic or military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the record straight : Australia has never received any economic aid from this country , or any free military aid either . There have been big purchases by Australia of United States military equipment , but these are not gifts ; we pay for it all . This is not always easy , for heavy U.S. tariffs and quotas upon Australia 's main exports present us with serious balance-of-payments difficulties . Nevertheless , we pay our way , and take some pride in doing so . We deeply admire the generosity of the American Government and people for their magnificent aid gifts to so many nations ; but Australia has neither sought nor received any of this from you , HOWARD BEALE . Australian Ambassador to the United States of America . Washington , April 10 , 1963 . A correction of the map error mentioned above was published in yesterday 's Review section . Savings in Strike Calculated To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Now that the newspaper presses are rolling again it might be well to take another look at the protests of monumental losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these protests , the restaurants , department stores , the newspapers themselves , all lost fabulous amounts , the estimated total running from $190 million to $250 mil- ' lion . But was this all social loss ? Most of us are neither theatrical producers , restaurateurs , department store proprietors , or newspaper publishers . Every dollar not taken in by these enterprises as business income was equivalently conserved by the rest of us as savings . In these days of high living costs and rising taxes a saving of $190 million to $250 million is cause for congratulation. not for . gloom . SOLON DE LEON . Long Island City , L.I. , April 6 , 1963 . Mystical Experience To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES In a letter published April 6 J. Greyson of El Cerrito , Calif. , criticizes one of your editorials which appeared in the Western and International editions of The Times ( March 19 ) . Mr. Greyson , a chemist , takes ' you to task for misunderstanding the ? sense in which the term " intuition " is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuition is not an idea conjured up from the ' mystical recesses of the scientist 's mind " but " reflects , instead , the entirety of the scientist 's knowledge . " The antithesis here proposed is dubious and the pejorative use of the word " mystical " is grossly unscientific and unhistorical . That . some so-called " mystics " have been charlatans is manifests That some so-called " scientific intuitions " are not only wrong in their conclusions ? but fail to accord with scientific method should also be apparent . On the same page on which you publish Mr. Greyson 's letter you pay editorial tribute to J. Robert Oppenheimer on the occasion of his receipt of the Fermi Award . In his pub ? lashed work Oppenheimer has cltarly , expressed his sense of the validity of philosophic mysticism . The capacity to bring into focus the " entirety " of knowledge may well be characteristic of many significant instances of mystical experience . This seems to be true not ' only of great religious mystics but of many artists and philosophers as well as scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1963 .
