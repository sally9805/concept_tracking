" RENT GENUINE BEATNIKS , " said the ad . " BADLY GROOMED BUT BRILLIANT ( MALE AND FEMALE ) . " It appeared in the Village Voice , parochial journal of Manhattan 's Greenwich Village , and it represented an occupational sideline of Voice Contributor Fred W. McDarrah . The U-rent-a-hipster bit began as a joke earlier this winter , but when the first ad drew more than ten replies , McDarrah began to operate for real . <P> McDarrah advertised beat lecturers , fund-raisers , photographic models , reciting poets ( fees : $25 to $50 per evening ) . While more response came , not all clients were acceptable . McDarrah ' turned down an interested trio of amateur photographers who wanted to improve their lens technique with beatnik girls . He had already found the sort of client he wanted when he sent beat Poet-Painter Ted Joans ( ne Jones ) to Scarsdale , where 32-year-old Joyce Barken , wife of a business executive , had turned her living room into a way-out coffeehouse , filled it up with the square root of society-doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joans ( " My poems are American neo-Dadaism " ) have to say to such an audience ? " I told them what the beats are really like , " he explains . " Everybody thinks the beats always smoke pot , smell horrible , and all that jazz . I take a bath every day , man . People also think beat girls like free sex . Listen , some of these chicks are so far out that 's the last thing they think of . One I know says , ' Sit across the room ; just being near me should be sexy enough . ' " <P> McDarrah claims his talent pool now includes just about all the hipsters in Manhattan except the Kerouac-Corso-Ginsberg sort , who are already approaching their first million and do n't need the bread . This week he is planning to supply two beats-one cat , one chick-for a birthday party given by a Madison Avenue adwoman for a fashion photographer .
