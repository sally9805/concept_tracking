txt // of his being an official will of course often affect the application of the law to a man : a policeman who does have reasonable suspicion is not liable for wrongful arrest ; and the governor of a gaol keeping a convict in prison on the order of a court is in a different legal position from a Mother Superior keeping a recalcitrant nun fretting in her cell . But the fact of being an official only alters and does not suspend the application of the law . Officials , like ordinary citizens , are legally answerable for their actions , although the answers that may be acceptable to the court are likely to be different . In view of the fact that officials , like ordinary mortals , are sometimes wrong in their judgement and not necessarily disinterested , it is of prime importance that they shall be answerable for their actions : for then they will have a powerful incentive to exert themselves to act reasonably and disinterestedly , and to avoid committing errors of judgement or lapses from integrity . Therefore , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not used to provide a de facto blanket immunity for all the servants of the Crown . To dispense all executive officials from being answerable to the Judiciary , and to leave them answerable only to the chief executive , is a major step towards tyranny , and when King James II claimed a general Dispensing Power as part of his prerogative , he was rightfully dethroned . Nevertheless there is a tension in determining to what extent officials shall be subject to legal penalties if they act in error . Men 's judgement being fallible it is inevitable that officials will make mistakes : if we say we shall punish these mistakes mercilessly , men will not become officials . While we need to give officials , being only men , an incentive to act honestly and competently in the discharge of their official duties , we must not demand of them , being only men , a more than human standard of excellence in their official actions . If a man undertakes a task which is hazardous and full of pitfalls , we can demand a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark what is done amiss . Our solution is to assign definite responsibilities to each official , and in particular in this case to confer narrowly limited discretion on those officials who are most tempted to abuse it , and make them subject to sanctions if they overstep the mark , and to reserve the discretion , whenever we possibly can , to the Judiciary , who are relatively free from temptation , and whose errors are relatively easy to detect and correct . Policemen and warders have , like private citizens , very little discretion to authorise coercion , and if they make a mistake , even in good faith , they will suffer for it . Judges // are left with a wide discretion ; but if they make a mistake , although there is a legal remedy ? appeal to a higher court ? , it will only correct the court 's error ? quash the conviction or alter the sentence ? and will not subject the erring Judges , provided only that they acted in good faith and not corruptly or maliciously , to any penalties for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law large discretion is conferred on the Judiciary , and therefore we depend upon there being judges capable of discharging judicial functions well . There must be at least a minority of persons capable of being judges , imbued with a love of law and liberty , and conditions must be such that those who actually are judges shall be able to discharge their functions without fear or favour . We have so arranged things that it is the judges who may make mistakes without being brought to book for it : it is important therefore that the mistakes shall be few . The Judiciary needs to constitute within the State a sub-community which is an Areopagite society , ' in which though judgement may fail and information may be inadequate , yet men are not sufficiently selfish to prefer their own way to the right way , and in which , there-fore , no sanctions are required . This makes certain demands both upon the natural abilities and propensities of the men concerned and upon the environmental conditions under which they live . For some judicial purposes more than average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of disinterestedness is required which is not easily come by . The need for intelligence and disinterestedness has inegalitarian overtones.2 A State that values justice , law , and liberty , will be an unequal one in the important sense that in it judges must occupy positions of power , and not everyone is capable of being a judge . Objection is sometimes made on egalitarian grounds to the present system of selecting jurors and appointing judges . It is alleged that it would be more democratic to select jurors by lot , as in Ancient Athens , and to elect and re-elect judges by a popular vote , as in some // American States . It should , however , be clear that the paramount consideration in choosing people to be judges ought to be the good administration of justice , and not any social or political dogma . For if the judges are not worthy and capable of power , power will fall into other hands , and we shall all be equally defenceless before the men who wield the truncheons . We need safeguards against fallibility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bound , by and large , to apply existing law , and not each decide cases on his own ; ' and where there is room for serious disagreement with a judge 's decision , the dispute can be settled by an appeal to a higher court . Against selfishness we have a variety of safeguards : juries are a chance selection of men , who are unknown and therefore unbribeable before the trial , and are un-get-at-able , often literally so , during the trial . Any private interest or prejudice that one of them may have is unlikely to be shared by all twelve . Granted only a limited level of reasonableness and unselfishness , individual interests will cancel out , and a jury does not exist as a body long enough for any corporate selfishness to develop . These provisions offer good security that the verdict of a jury ? the highest common denominator of the individual judgements of the jurors ? will be reasonable and disinterested . The judges do not have the random anonymity of jurors . It is a matter of great moment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important achievement was to make the judges irremovable by the Crown . This deprives the government of its most powerful sanction against a judge who will not toe their line : and while it is difficult for a man who knows that it may cost him his job to decide fairly and justly between Sovereign and subject , it is not so difficult for a man to be disinterested in his decisions if he knows that he personally stands to lose nothing , whatever decision he gives . It is also important that he should stand to gain nothing ; and this in the modern world has an important corollary . Many people now have security of tenure ( always , of course , during good behaviour ) in their jobs , and can not be dismissed at pleasure , but still depend on favour for promotion . It is important that no judge can reasonably expect to be promoted , or fear that he may be passed over if he fails to watch his step . Else his independence is undermined ; as happened in the Middle Ages , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see to a better ; whereby all those in less lucrative ones were made // subservient to Pope or King . Therefore a county court judge , when appointed , must expect to remain one to the end of his days , and not entertain any fond hopes of the High Court , and if ever it becomes necessary to establish stipendiary magistrates throughout the country , they too ought to be un-promote-able , and to be a stipendiary magistrate must be made to be an acceptable " career grade " . Judges who are irremovable and un-promote-able will be independent of the government . They must also be independent of possible litigants . Therefore they need to be so rich that they are unbribeable . For many years in England the judges were above the reach of temptation , but with the great inflation in the years during and after the Second World War , they were brought down to a level where ordinary financial considerations operate . No case even of attempted bribery has been reported , but Sir Winston Churchill was right in deciding that judges must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obviously so . Parliament objected to his proposal to make their stipends free of income tax , perhaps rightly ; but should have used other means to secure the same result , so that no judge should be subject to financial pressure of any kind , and so that no judge should ever have to consider whether he might , on retiring from the bench , augment his pension by going into business . Financial pressures , although the most obvious , are not the only pressures that may be brought to bear to influence a man 's judgement . Indeed , just because they are so obvious they are easy to recognise and often to resist . Social and personal pressures are more insidious . It is a great merit that Justices proceed in eyre , and are strangers in assize towns and not local dignitaries . They are aloof , and so far as local society is concerned , anonymous . The wig and the robes are the badges of a real anonymity , and it is unlikely that the judge will know anything of a case except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ever , in his personal capacity , have done business with any litigant , or been to dinner with him , or met his uncle out shooting . It is sometimes argued that the North of England needs a permanent Crown Court established in York , with resident judges . But the arbitration of strangers is to be preferred . Granted these , or other similar , conditions , the Judiciary will constitute a sub-community or set of sub-communities within the State , in which , thanks to our being selective in our choice of personnel , and thanks to our having stacked the cards appropriately with respect to environmental conditions and the pressures arising therefrom , we // have been able to modify limitation B(i) ? Some Selfishness ? on human nature sufficiently for the sub-community to be an Areopagite society , operating without sanctions . The metaphor of symbiosis is again appropriate . The coercive community , if it is to be a Con-stitutional Free State , needs the existence of judicial communities which are not only without coercive sanctions , but which are pretty well without sanctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can exist only within the framework of a coercive community which provides a corner where there is an environmental sub-climate in which virtue prospers and disinterestedness is a practic-able policy , and from whose unselected citizenry the select membership of the Judiciary can be chosen . SECTION 22 CONTROL OF COERCION THE procedures enjoined by Process of Law are clearly effective against isolated abuses of coercive power . They have , as a happy historical fact , proved effective in preventing any general abuse of power on the part of those who control the coercive machinery of State : but we have yet to show why they have been effective , and under what conditions they will continue to be so . Coercive power is not the only power . A man has power2 if it results from his saying , Let X happen ' that X does happen . His power is coercive if , should the person whom he addresses be utterly unwilling to bring X about , nevertheless that person 's behaviour will be determined either by force or by the threat of force so as to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often not utterly unwilling , and therefore there are many people possessed of power , but not coercive power , and hence we can found the State not on force alone , but primarily on reason , consent and obligation . So long as men are not all utterly unwilling and bloody-minded , they will do some things they are asked to do because they think they ought to or because they are persuaded that the things are good things to do . Therefore a person who has authority , as I have defined // it , ' will also have power ; moreover , there will be some people with influence , ' and hence also power . The recipe for Constitutional Freedom is that the coercive mach-inery of the State should itself be based as much as possible on author-ity and influence , and as little as possible on sanctions , and not at on coercive sanctions . This will provide a built-in clutch , which will engage so long as those in control of the coercive machinery are using it rightly , but will " slip " if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary controls the coercive machinery of State , but with the aid of magistrates , who are voluntary , and judges , who are un-get-at-able . In the course of exercising coercion against criminals , the Home Secretary needs the co-operation of magistrates and judges , which is forthcoming if he wants to exercise coercion lawfully , but not if he wants to exercise it unlawfully . Chief Constables are not appointed by the Home Secretary nor are removable by him at will . They will be greatly influenced by what the Home Secretary says , but only so long as it is not contrary to the procedures laid down in Process of Law : if the Home Secretary asks a Chief Constable to make a special effort against drug-trafficking , prostitution , or speeding , the Chief Constable is likely to comply ; but if the Home Secretary were to direct a Chief Constable to have all the prostitutes in his area shaved and branded , he would not comply , nor would he lose his job for not complying . If a Chief Constable told his subordinates to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly if they were them-selves convinced that he was a criminal , and fabricate evidence and perjure themselves in court to secure his conviction : and if a police-man refused to pay his part in " framing " a man , he might suffer for it ; he probably would not lose his job , but he might lose promotion , or be detailed to perform unpleasant duties . But at the worst , he could only lose his job : he could not himself be imprisoned , fined or executed for disobedience to orders . Such an offence does not exist in civilian law . In the army , disobedience may constitute mutiny , and may be punishable by death ; and few men would risk martyrdom rather than take their place in a firing squad carrying out an unlawful execution . But the martyr 's crown is padded for civilians , and although it may be difficult to stand up for Justice , and may cost dear , it is not that difficult , and the cost is not that great . Comparable buffers separate the Home Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells locked . Neither the Prison Commissioners nor the // governor of a gaol are likely to co-operate in helping the Home Secretary to put away a troublesome subject , and if they do not cooperate , there is not much he can do about it . He can not bring many sanctions to bear on them . Even if he were able to get rid of them , it would be difficult to find replacements who were more complaisant to his will . And a Home Secretary unaided is likely to be an incompetent gaoler and ineffective executioner . Naboth 's life would have been safe in England . If Jezebel had sent letters to the judges or the local justices of the peace , they would have sent copies to The Times , and would have found Naboth " Not Guilty " : if to the Chief Constable , he would have consulted his Watch Committee , who would have told him to do nothing : if to the governor of the local gaol , the mere appearance of his warders trying to arrest Naboth , and drag him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Habeas Corpus . Even if the police had been willing to perjure themselves ? as sometimes in England , most regrettably , they are ? , they would not have been prepared to frame a man they knew to be innocent ; and if a wicked Chief Constable could find two members of his force evil enough to do his dirty work , they would still be subject to cross-examination by defending counsel , and Naboth would be able to give his own evidence before a judge and a jury who were both beyond Jezebel 's reach . Finally we should notice that the Home Secretary not only has to rely on influence and authority , rather than power based on sanctions , to get his wishes carried out , but depends for his being Home Secretary on influence and nothing else . If a majority of the members of the House of Commons will not support him with their votes , the government of which he is a member , can not continue . The party system , with all its defects , institutionalises the principle of Influence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Parliamentary Mamelukes are , for sound historical reasons , sensitive to any abuse of coercive power , and ready on that account to withdraw support . The institutions of Freedom will only work under certain more general conditions . We have arranged , as it were , for the clutch to slip if ever those in control of the coercive machinery of State attempt to misapply it . But for this to be feasible , the clutch must slip neither too readily nor not at all , nor must the coercive machinery of State be overloaded . To take the last point first . It has been possible in England to have little resort to coercion , because there have been relatively few crimiCONTROL // nals so desperate as to need coercing at all . The great majority of the populace are law-abiding : even when they break the law , it is enough normally to summon them to the magistrates ' court , for them to come at the time stated , uncoerced : and even those criminals who will not come voluntarily , are not prepared to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical policy to have the police unarmed too . And therefore the police are impotent against the whole people . If , however , the crime rate continues to increase , and criminals become more dangerous , the case will be altered . Law and order must be maintained . If peaceable citizens can not go about their lawful occasions without reasonable certainty of not being set upon by thugs , they will demand stronger action against criminals , or else must take the law into their own hands . In order to secure more effective action against criminals , the safeguards against the coercive machinery of State being misused will be dropped . Shopkeepers in seaside resorts will demand that they be protected from teen-age hooligans : passengers in buses will demand that they shall not be delayed by C.N.D. demonstrators lying in the streets : and measures devised against these law-breakers will be available in future against law-abiding citizens who may wish to demonstrate lawfully against unconstitutional behaviour on the part of the government . In a similar way , if criminals take to carrying arms , the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed but entitled to shoot first ? it is neither reasonable nor feasible to require policemen not to shoot until one of their number has been maimed or killed . But if policemen are armed and entitled to shoot first , they may make mistakes ; and few men , however much they were in the right , would risk being at the receiving end of a gun fired by mistake . At present the worst risk the law-abiding citizen runs in view of the fallibility of the police is that he might be arrested ? perhaps by mistake for someone else ; if this should befall him , within a day he will have been able to protest his innocence to someone outside the police force ? a magistrate ? and will be released . And knowing that this is the worst that can happen , a law-abiding citizen can argue with a policeman if a policeman seems to be abusing his power , and can , for example , take the policeman 's number and report him for misconduct . One would feel less confident about arguing with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might go off , and there would be no one then to say that you were not behaving in a suspicious manner , like a criminal who might be armed and attempting to resist arrest . // The emergence of the highly mobile , motorised criminal gang again poses a problem for Freedom . One way in which we have drawn the teeth of the coercive machinery of State has been by decentralisation . If I suspect that the Chief Constable of Hampshire has got his knife into me , I can go and live in Dorset , where there will not be the same animus against me . At present it is a fanciful hypothesis , but if the Home Secretary and the Chief Constable of Hampshire were both communists , and I were an active anti-communist , I might well'then feel that Dorset was a more salubrious base for my activities . Such a hypothetical contingency carries little weight against the actual activities of criminals who steal a car in one county , use it to hi-jack a lorry loaded with tobacco in another , leave the lorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth . Against highly organised and mobile criminals we need to have a highly organised and nation-wide police force . But this constitutes a centralised coercive force which could be used effectively not only against criminals but against the liberties of the people . So too , on a juristic level , a presumption of innocence is workable only if most people are in fact innocent . If the guilty are only a very small proportion of the populace , then by allowing those guilty men to escape whose guilt can not be proved beyond reasonable doubt , we shall not cause a serious increase of crime or threaten the maintenance of law and order : if however most people are unruly , and in the habit of breaking the law , we can not afford to allow them a presumption of innocence . And so in countries where the people suffer from too Latin a temperament , or where there has been an earthquake or a revolution , draconian measures have to be applied ? the imposition of a curfew , the shooting of looters at sight ? in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civil society . Nor is this only a measure of practical necessity : it is one of logic also . A legal presumption of innocence becomes un-workable , because incredible , when there is a rational presumption of guilt . We know that most motorists habitually break the law : we just do not believe their protestations of innocence : nor do the courts , which while formally maintaining the presumption of innocence , in fact will find a man guilty on fairly flimsy evidence , and will acquit him only if his innocence can be proved beyond reasonable doubt . In the application of the law about H.M. Customs and Excise , where again a presumption of innocence would be unrealistic , it has in some cases been formally removed ; and a man found in possession of a watch , on which Customs duty has not been paid , // has to prove his innocence , rather than have his guilt proved . In these different ways , a general law-abidingness on the part of the great majority of the people is a necessary condition of constitutional liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possimus . ' Other emphases express other truths . It is necessary , if we are to be free , that most people serve the laws not barely by obeying them but in a more positive sense . Criminals must not only be few in number , but isolated . Most citizens must be prepared to co-operate with the police in a passive way , by giving information whenever they can and evidence in court when required . For if people do volunteer , formation freely and give evidence when it is needed , they have mething to withold if ever the forces of law and order should seek to abuse their power and overthrow the law . If people " prefer not to involved in court proceedings " then criminals will be convicted my on police evidence , and the temptation and opportunity of perjury n the part of the police will both alike be increased . The Ghetto ument2 is two-edged , and subjects who withhold all co-operation ith the forces of law and order make themselves victims rather than tizens . Servi ' is a strong word ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if e obeys them and occasionally co-operates in bringing law-breakers justice . The co-operation implied is much more active than that . t is not strictly true that in a free society every one must be a Mame-uke ? or rather , admirable though this would be as an ideal , no actual ciety composed of men , characterised as they are by selfishness and ilibility could reach that degree of voluntariness , so that if free ' to be applied to actual societies , it can not mean that ; but it is a aracteristic of a free society , that far more people than in any other rm of society , do , and must , play an active part in running it , in hich they willingly submit themselves to requirements not of their wn choosing . A voluntary acceptance of heteronomy is a necessary condition of Constitutional Freedom . If we are to be free from the danger of abuse f power , the coercive machinery of the State must be manned at vital ints by people who can refuse to carry out instructions which they eem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntary . But if the coercive machinery of State is to be effective , e people who man it must act together , and this will not happen ifiiciently surely and often to be effective if each acts as seems best // to him . The magistrates are voluntary , in that a man may choose whether to become a magistrate or not , and will not lose anything financially if he ceases to be a magistrate ; but while he is a magistrate he must administer justice not as seems to him most equitable and just but as the laws lay down . An Anglican or Roman Catholic judge may think that divorce is contrary to the will of God , and wrong ; but he must not refuse to grant decrees nisi on that account ; nor may a humanist sitting on the bench refuse to pass sentence of death upon a convicted murderer for conscience ' sake . It is not that divorce and capital punishment are not wrong ? they may well be : it is that civil society essentially depends upon each man not setting himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Constitutional Freedom depends upon many men discharging to the best of their abilities the definite and limited responsibilities assigned them . As a juror I am not called upon to decide whether the amiable defendant must needs go to prison or not , nor whether prison sentences are the right penalty for drunken driving , but only whether , beyond reasonable doubt , the defendant was drunk or not while driving a car on the date stated . If juries will not convict the guilty , their jurisdiction will be transferred to magistrates who will : if religious and humane men will not become judges , less sensitive souls will , who will not merely not find distasteful duties distasteful , but will be less discriminating in cases in which the judge is required to exercise discretion . Nor is it only the crude argument , " If you wo n't , worse will . " Rather , it is that Constitutional Freedom depends on the Assignment of Responsibilities to men who will discharge them voluntarily , and if each man decides not with reference to the duty assigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may result from his decision and his personal moral evaluation of the total resultant , chaos must ensue . It follows then that conscientious refusal to carry out official duties or to enter into the service of the laws is something never to be undertaken lightly and if at all only with extreme reluctance . One must be convinced not merely that the laws are wrong ? which is necessarily often the case , in an imperfect world peopled by imperfect men ? but that they are so wrong that they are beyond remedy , that there is nothing good about them , and that the good life can not be lived under them . It is possible for these conditions to be fulfilled . Socrates refused to carry out an unlawful order of the Thirty , Socrates who valued civil obedience so highly that he allowed himself to be unjustly put to death by the legitimate legal process of Athens . But it is not to be CONTROL OF COERCION supposed that all systems of government are evil or constitute a betrayal of the State . And if the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though it is undoubtedly bad at some points , and even may be wicked , then one may well be under a pure moral obligation to participate in it actively in some fashion . For only by people participating in it willingly can the power of the government be restrained from being abused . He who contracts out forfeits all say in the course of events . The exact point at which a conscientious man should resign his official commission we can not determine in abstract . It depends too much on particular circumstances . Sometimes a dramatic resignation may be effective in bringing an issue to public attention , and then , contrary to the tenor of the foregoing argument , it may be the right thing to do . Sometimes refusal to carry out one 's duty may be tacitly recognised as a lawful safety-valve ? for instance that a jury may refuse to convict even on the clearest evidence , if Parliament has allowed the law to get too far out of step with public opinion . Sometimes a man may be selective in what duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed and assessed only in the light of concrete situations . The one general point is that , contrary to much modern thinking , . the possession of an ultra-tender conscience is not a virtue , but a vice . Or , rather , we ought to have consciences , and tender ones , but must expect them to be bruised . It is often maintained , under the name of autonomy , that a man can not be acting rightly if he is acting on orders , and that the necessary and sufficient condition of being moral is to think that one knows best . If to this doctrine of Private Judgement is added the doctrine mentioned earlier , ' that law and morality are totally divorced from each other , and that law is totally external to the moral man ? simply a matter of unpleasant consequences if he fails to comply with its requirements ? , it is natural to conclude that the path of morality is always that of conscientious objection , and that to the many compromises of public life , and the distasteful , immoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , the fastidious man of integrity must respond by saying " ohne mich " . And this is wrong . The laws for a moral man , are not external , but internal : hence the conflict . And although I , and I alone , am ultimately responsible for the decisions I make , and am in that sense autonomous , this does not mean that I , a finite and fallible being , should never act against my better judgement . Nor IO2 THE CONTROL OF ARMIES should I , living together with other finite and fallible beings , deem it my duty to be a law unto myself , and to do only that which is right in my own eyes . ' SECTION 23 THE CONTROL OF ARMIES BRITAIN has little to teach the world about the control of armies . The fortunate fact of being an island during the formative years of our constitution enabled us to dispense with a standing army altogether . The Navy was enough : and navies are no use for suppressing native citizens . Other lands have been less lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overrun by foreigners . And with an army , unlike a police force or prison service , efficiency is the paramount considera-tion , and concessions to constitutionality can not be afforded if the cost is the difference between victory and defeat . An army must have a centralised command , and there must be no weak links in the chain of command , so that obedience must be guaranteed by the possibility of sanctions , if necessary of coercive sanctions . Military law tends 2 towards the opposite extreme to civilian law : it embodies the smallest concessions to Justice , Equity , and Humanity that must be made if human beings are to work together at all , and where there is doubt , these considerations must give way to purely military ones . An army thus has concentrated and effective coercive power which could be turned against the native citizens , and in particular against the legally constituted civil authorities . Every State that has an army needs to consider this danger , and devise safeguards against it . The danger of disaffection among officers is greater than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutinous men without officers may do some damage but do not have the organisation , and are unlikely to improvise it , to be able to constitute an effective coercive force or to establish an effective government . Moreover , only extreme ineptitude on the part of the civil authority will provoke the men to mutiny against it . Provided they are well fed and regularly paid , soldiers do not want to mutiny against the civil government . But officers , having the habitual obedience of their men , are likely to be obeyed even in // unlawful enterprises , and an army , properly led , is ex hypothesi an effective instrument of coercion . Moreover , officers are not so easily contented by food and pay . They may have other aspirations and ambitions , which civil government may not have been able to satisfy . And so it is that generals in ancient Rome and colonels in modern Arabia have often been tempted to turn their arms against their govern-ment , and often with success . We may make the general observation that most governments that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inept governments , which have already shown themselves unfit to rule and unworthy of respect . It is a counsel , too obvious to be useful , to a civil government anxious to safeguard itself against a coup d'etat , to tell it to be good . Other , more specific , safeguards are worth pointing out . Officers should be largely drawn from , and identified with , the ruling class : for then they will , in general , have little temptation to upset the status quo . If officers are to be drawn from the ruling class , some members of the ruling class must be willing to serve as officers : it was because the landed gentry of England were willing , themselves and their sons , to serve their King in the field , however much they might resist his prerogative at home , that such armed forces as there were could not have been used by the King to subvert the constitu-tion . Any nation or government or group which despises the pro-fession of arms , so that none of its own members will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it do not feel at home there , is inviting the loss of its liberty . Colonel Blimp should not be too much con-temned , or he may change his name to Nasser . The profession of arms should be esteemed , but not too highly . Rome lost her liberty not only because her citizens were unwilling to serve as soldiers , but because her careerists were all too willing to seek military command . ' If the army provides a path to political power , it will attract people who want political power ; and it is dangerous to put coercive power in the hands of those who want political power , because if they get it , they will have too much power , and if they do not , they will be tempted to rebel . Service officers should be honoured , but not promoted to political power ? unless they are well and truly retired from the services ? in much the same way , though for different reasons , that ecclesiastics are honoured , but debarred from political // office . There will always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let other avenues lead to it . Cicero in the Senate , or Crassus in his counting-house were less dangerous to the Roman Constitution than Caesar in command . Other sociological considerations are too detailed to be discussed here . But sociology apart , even if an army is tempted to rebel , it may find it not feasible . An army is not a viable community on its own . It needs , in many different ways , the support of those it is designed to defend , and can not survive unless it can continue to command certain essential services . The most obvious is money . And here the case is greatly altered since Roman times . Then money was entirely in the form of gold and silver , and it was feasible by coercive power alone to extract rapidly from a civil population a sufficiency of bullion . A Roman commander could threaten a city in Asia with fire and sword unless they handed over a stated quantity of gold and silver ; and if they resisted , he could carry out his threat , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fire-resistant , collect all that the city had contained . The Colonel of the Coldstream Guards can not use such short and sharp methods on the manager of Barclays Bank at Berwick with success . When the French army in Algeria revolted in 1958 , it could do so only with the connivance of the French Treasury which continued to convey the necessary financial credits . At an earlier stage in our constitutional history , in the infancy of credit , when money still characteristically took the form of seizable coins , it still proved possible to control the coercive power by controlling its supply of money . What gave steam to the principle of Taxation with Representation was that the taxes which Parliament had voted , the tax-payers really were willing to pay . These taxes could be collected easily and inexpensively , whereas any further levy would have been resisted , and would have been difficult and expensive to collect , even with the aid of coercive force . Thus even though the King might be tempted to dispense with Parliament and rest his power on the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army was not good at collecting taxes , whereas a parliamentary vote did make them forthcoming ; and this in turn depended on the relative willingness with which taxpayers would pay those taxes which they felt they had , through their representatives in Parliament , themselves agreed to . Such a principle of taxation no longer holds good . Parliament is now felt as the sovereign , or as the electoral college appointing the soverTHE CONTROL OF ARMIES , I05 eign , rather than as the representative of the tax-payer , and taxes voted by Parliament are felt as levies imposed by a sovereign rather than as contributions promised by one 's representative on behalf of oneself . The change in attitude on the part of the tax-payer has been particularly rapid in recent years , partly as a result of the greatly increased level of taxation . In order therefore to collect taxes , less and less reliance has been put on the willingness of the tax-payer to pay , and more and more on methods of enforcement based ultimately on the coercive machinary of the State . The element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now than hitherto ( though this is a matter of degree only ; taxes never were voluntary , nor could they have been ) , and this safeguard against usurpation has been lost . Although a modern army can not raise funds for itself by pillage , and we are to that extent safer against military rebellion than our ancestors , a combination of the Army and the Treasury , or at least the Army and the Commissioners of Inland Revenue would be viable , and could , so far as this argument goes , be dangerous . There are , fortunately , other securities . Military weapons have become much more sophisticated , and demand much more technical skill for their servicing , and depend upon a large technological base for their maintenance . Writers sometimes complain that the invention of the machine-gun strengthened the hand of the tyrant , and destroyed the musket-carrying citizen army which was the basis , in Realpolitik , of democracy ; but they forget the increased dependence on ordnance and munitions factories , on mechanics and engineers and electricians and signals men ; on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern army has developed an enormous " tail " , and the tail drags the dog , and would prevent him turning and devouring the body politic he is supposed to guard . Once Hephaestus had used his skill to forge a sword , that sword could be used without further recourse to him , against his will and even against his person , to coerce and exploit him . The wielder was superior to the workman , and could exploit him and discard him at will . Not so the pilot of a Spitfire his maintenance men . And with a Thor , a Minuteman , or a Jupiter , there is no pilot , no romantic officer , no swords , no pistols , no machine-guns , but only a host of technicians and hundreds of factories . The distinction between the military and the rest of the community is becoming too blurred for the army to be a separate organisation which might be turned against the rest of the community . The army has become so much part of the community that it must Io6 THE RULE OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community , or else destroy its own effectiveness . Moreover , with the development of nuclear weapons , the army has become , constitutionally speaking , much more of a navy : in pursuit of greater effectiveness against the enemy , its weapons have become unusable against the citizens at home . Many officers in the Pentagon might be members of the John Birch society and might wish to overthrow the power of the President and Congress : but could hardly do so by dispatching an H-bomb to the Capitol or the White House . SECTION 24 THE RULE OF LAW PROCESS of Law safeguarded a coercive community against the abuse of coercive power by laying down a set of procedures governing the use and alleged misuse of coercive power , so that if there were any abuse , the fact would be known , and if it were known , many people up and down the country would withdraw the co-operation that was necessary for the effective working of the coercive machinery of State . Process of Law had to be a procedure , because only a procedure could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be quite clear to everyone , beyond possibility of argument , when an abuse of power was taking place : upon questions of substance rather than of form we can neither always obtain antecedent agreement nor formulate general laws which will cover all cases unambiguously . Our procedure left wide discretion to certain specified officialsjudges ? to authorise the use of coercion , and to determine whether coercion in the past had been legally or illegally used . The discretion of the Judiciary had to be very wide , in order that the procedure could be purely procedural and formal , so that if there were an abuse of coercive power there could be the maximum possible agreement that it had occurred , so that in turn there should be a concerted withdrawal of co-operation by many different , independent persons up and down the country . We have thus secured effective control of coercive power at the cost of giving wide discretion to certain authorities , and therefore , in the absence of further safeguards , laying ourselves open to the abuse of authority.JWe have already spoken of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be vested , and to secure them // against some of the cruder pressures and temptations : but this is not enough . Even with the cruder temptations removed , there are many other , more insidious , ones . And even with the best intentions , an perfect self-knowledge , judges and legislators can make mistakes . W therefore need to supplement the set of sharply defined procedures which constitute Process of Law by further procedures , divisions of authority , limitations on discretion , critiques of the exercise of discretion , in order to guide and safeguard those in authority , and to enable their decisions to be criticised . These we shall call the Rule of Law . The Rule of Law has been differently understood by different writers . By some it has been taken in a sense which includes , rather than supplements , Process of Law : by some it has been used in the same sense as Natural Law . We shall understand it as a restriction on how the ) authorities may reach a decision and what they may authorise . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make any decision they please . Their decisions are open to rational assessment and criticism , by subjects as well as by themselves , upon the basis of human rationality and shared values that are the prerequisites of any com-munity 's existing . The Rule of Law restricts the way in which the authorities reach decisions and what they actually authorise in order that their decisions shall not be justly liable to unfavourable criticism . It applies chiefly to the authorities of the State , because they wield coercive power , and it is inherent in their position that their decisions will be enforced upon a recalcitrant party , willy-nilly , and therefore upon one who has in no sense participated in the decision-making process . For this reason , however much we try to arrange coercive communities so that every member does participate in their decision procedures , and should feel the force of the fourth , fifth , and sixth arguments of Section 12 ( the arguments from the General Will , from consultation , and from self-identification with the community ) , ' it is inherently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be non-participants . Hence the hard external aspect the State some-times assumes . And hence also the need for the authorities of the State to be guided primarily by considerations which are independent of the decision procedure actually in force.2 The Rule of Law must guide the authorities into making decisions which are reasonable ( or at least not unreasonable ) , so that if a recalcitrant party refuses to accept a decision of theirs as binding , we can still feel that it is a decision he ought to accept , in spite of his never having committed himself to it by being Io8 THE RULE OF LAW involved in the making of it . We want to be able to say that the decision is one which he should not flout , and would in fact obey if he were reasonable and not bloody-minded . For then we can expect even a non-participant to accept it , and if he does not , and we have to use force , we have an answer to his further question , Is it right to do that to me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be the chief guide . It can not , of course , be expressed by any simple formula . Although we shall attempt to formulate certain aspects of it as precisely as possible , it is more a style of argument than a set of slogans . We argue on the basis of the reasonableness of men , all the time setting up safeguards against possible error . We believe that men can be rational , can be disinterested , can be adequately informed ; but we know that their judgement is fallible , that they are often selfish , that our information is often inadequate . Because of our beliefs , we can believe that society is possible , that men can coexist in communities : because of our knowledge we need always to be taking practical precautions . And therefore we shall , all the time , be guided by an ideal of rationality , avily qualified by counsels of imperfection . The Rule of Law will alter its aspect as we consider it from the point of view of the authorities or from that of the subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided by whom ? how to set about deciding them ? what decisions to reach ? The subjects need the protection of limits and definiteness : to provide them with a basis for predicting the authorities ' decisions so that they can make their own plans ; to afford them some security and assurance that the authorities will not overstep the limits ; and to give them some arguing points for when they need to criticise the authorities ' decisions . Subjects need to know where they are with regard to Leviathan , understanding what things they may or may not do , confident that Leviathan will not hurt them so long as they do nothing wrong , and able to engage in rational argument with Leviathan , and form rational views about him . We shall consider the internal aspect , that of guiding the rulers , first ; that is , we shall consider what are the marks of a right or wrong exercise of authority , and defer until later2 the consideration of what restrictions need to be placed on the exercise of authority if the subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , is to be able to lead a livable life . THE RULE OF LAW IO9 In considering the exercise of authority from the inside , we have an ideal of rational responsible action . Every decision of an authority ought to be a rational one . But the decisions that ordinary men naturally make are often not rational . We seek therefore to make the decisions of the authorities as open as possible to the influence of reason , and as immune as possible from natural tendencies ? selfishness , inattention ? making for unreasonable decisions . To this end , we divide authority between different persons or bodies ; we hold authorities answerable for their decisions ; we lay down limits on the discretion that each authority has ; we have a number of rules of procedure ; and we formulate , although only in vague and general terms , the principles that are to guide the authorities . We divide authority . It is partly for the same reason as we have for the weak doctrine of the Separation of Powers . ' The self-interest of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of another , nor are two mistakes likely to be in the same direction . If one official reaches a wrong decision on account of self-interest or by mistake , the other one is unlikely to co-operate in carrying out the first official 's self-interested plans , and may well query any mistake . By dividing authority we make it much more difficult to abuse . Rational decisions can still be made , but irrational ones are likely to be filtered out . The division of authority has the further merit of requiring the one official to think what his reasons are and state them , in telling the other one what he wants done . If authority is divided , people have to co-operate to exercise it : and since we do not naturally happen to act together in the required way , we have to communicate in order to achieve co-operation . And some rationale of the action proposed is almost always implicit in asking a man to undertake it . And therefore , merely in having to co-operate there is some pressure to say what the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are . The letters and files are in part a device for articulating the rationale of decisions ; which in turn helps to ensure that the decisions are rational.2 We can secure the same end further by making officials , as far as is feasible , Responsible , or Answerable for their Actions . That is to say , they may have to answer the question , Why did you do it ? ' Some-times we always require reasons ? as in the law courts.3 Sometimes there is only a possibility that the official may have to justify his actions . But even the bare possibility is enough to encourage him to think in IIO THE RULE OF LAW advance what reasons he can , if challenged , adduce in defence of his decision . And thus Responsibility is another factor making for rationality . We lay down limits on the discretion that each authority has . This makes it easier to establish standards for the correct exercise of the discretion . A man deciding what the Public Interest requires can hardly be faulted as definitely wrong , whatever his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain widow does or does not qualify for a pension , he is much more open to question if he gives a grossly wrong decision . By having only a limited discretion in one type of case , he will become subject to certain pressures towards consistency , ' and will become more expert in reaching right decisions in cases of this type . Each question will thus have to be decided by those best equipped to decide it well . The temptation to abuse authority will be small , since the power that a limited authority confers is itself small , and such errors as do occur will be easier to remedy , by appeal or by a writ of certiorari . The possibility of the charge of acting ultra vires has been a powerful deterrent against abusing one 's authority . The Rule of Law lays down many rules of procedure for those in authority : that they should hear both sides of the case ; that they should consider all the relevant factors , and not consider any irrelevant factors ; that they should not be biased by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other more particular procedures , prevent some of the worst mistakes . The exact form that a procedure takes is often open to criticism . There may be disadvantages as well as advantages in a given procedure . The procedures of the criminal law have the disadvantage that many criminals escape justice , but we weigh against this the greater importance of ensuring that no innocent man suffers coercion unjustly . Often in fixing on a procedure we have to balance advantages against disadvantages . The Rule of Law does not require that exactly the particular procedures we actually have should be followed rigor-ously , but only that there should be some procedures , exemplifying the values or securing the purposes that ours do , and that these , what-ever they are , should be scrupulously observed . Finally , the Rule of Law is expressed in certain vague principles ? Freedom , Justice , Humanity ? which we formulate , 2 and which should guide the authorities , in cases where they are applicable . These principles do not lay down exactly what is , or is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular cases . They are heads of argument , rather than rigid rules . Nevertheless , since those exercising authority are rational , they can obtain guidance from these general principles , and if they fail to , can be criticised by other men , also rational , for having failed to . The Rule of Law is thus an articulation of the principle of Con-stitutionalism , ' less rigid than the principle of Constitutional Limita-tion , 2 less vague than that of Constitutional Criticism.3 It contains some principles of Constitutional Criticism , but in addition lays down rules of procedure , which determine the manner of decision-making but not the content of the decisions made , and lays down more definite restrictions still , limiting what may be decided by whom . But it does not quite become a principle of Constitutional Limitation . It does not set rigid ? but undecidable ? limits to lawful authority . Rather it is a principle of limited limitation . We can not limit authority altogether . But we can limit it in limited respects . We can , at a certain cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty of the subject . We can not extend such rigid safeguards to all the interests of every subject . But we can have other procedures which although affording less stringent safeguards nevertheless constitute some security against some sorts of error and abuse . To deprive a man of his livelihood is less bad than to deprive him of his life ; but bad all the same . It would be unreasonable to have the whole apparatus of the criminal courts , with their formal procedure , restrictive law of evidence , heavy onus of proof : but it would be unreasonable also to say that therefore we could take no cognisance at all of arbitrary dismissal . We can not secure that no injustice will ever be done . We can not construct dams to block the tide of events and prevent authority ever overflowing its limits . But we can choose that some injustices will be done rather than others . We can construct sluices which will divert the floods from the most precious pastures . Life , limb , and liberty are the central interests of man ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have defined it.4 Therefore , just as in Process of Law , we elaborated stringent controls over the power to coerce , 5 so the Rule of Law fences about the authority to authorise coercion by rigid limitations , as well as many rules of procedure . Authority over the coercive machinery of State therefore is the most closely guarded authority , and only the Judiciary in the traditional sense of the word , may directly authorise coercion . We shall ? elucidate the conII2 THE IDEAL RULE OF LAW siderations which should govern the authorisation of coercion and with regard to this limited , but crucially important , sort of authority lay down stringent limitations . Authority in respect of authorising coercion , however , does not stand by itself . It leads on to other sorts of authority . Much as the concept of life leads on to liberty , ' so the concept of liberty leads on to that of property.2 Property is a central , though less central , interest of men . Property rights need to be safe-guarded , though neither in the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of property in turn give rise to many other interests . Most of these are relatively modern . Driving and wireless licences could not have been conceived before the twentieth century . Only in a modern industrial economy are jobs and pension-rights more important than the ownership of land or of the other means of pro-duction . And therefore while the adjudication of disputes about property has , for the most part , been vested in the judges in the traditional sense of the word , who have worked out many procedures and principles to embody the Rule of Law , the decision of disputes con-cerning more recently developed interests has been assigned haphazard to administrative officials to decide on an ad hoc basis , without proper consideration of the requirements of the Rule of Law . After we have considered how the exercise of authority vested in judicial officials in the traditional sense should be governed by the Rule of Law , both in its internal and in its external aspect , we need to go on to consider its application to administrative4 as well as to legislative officials.s SECTION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law can not be satisfactorily formulated in a simple way , it often has been taken , in conjunction with the traditional doctrine of the Separation of Powers , 6 as a principle of Constitutional Limitation . It is not an adequate formulation , but it is an easily intel-ligible ideal , and therefore has proved of great value , if only as an approximation ; and , where it is inadequate , its inadequacies are illuminating . // The Ideal Rule of Law presupposes the traditional doctrine of the Separation of Powers , which is itself only an approximation . It lays upon each organ of government its appropriate restriction , namely : ( i ) The Judiciary must apply existing law , not make up new laws . ( ii ) The Executive must act only on the instructions of the Judiciary in applying coercion . ( iii ) The Legislature must enact only general laws , not Acts of Attainder , nor retrospective laws . These provisions clearly leave the Judiciary no room for abusing its authority ; and the Executive either is acting on the Judiciary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or has at its disposal only those sanctions and means of applying pressure that other bodies , associations , and private individuals have . It has the sanction of dismissal against its own employees , and can secure other people 's services by buying them , but it can not force them or threaten them with imprisonment if they are not willing . The Legislature is less trammelled : indeed the restrictions imposed by the Ideal Rule of Law on the Legislature are inadequate as well as impracticable . But at least the Ideal Rule of Law provides the important safeguard that the supreme legal authority may not authorise coercion against any particular person . Only the Judiciary may do that , after hearing the defence and finding the case proved . Nulla poena sine JuDIC1o . The Legislature may make the laws , but that is not enough to secure that a particular man should be coerced , nor that any one man should be , unless a whole lot of others too . Only on the orders of a judge can a man be coerced , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , which the subject can find out beforehand , and take care not to contravene . Moreover the subject can be sure that the authorities will not pick on him , and discriminate against him individually in the exercise of coercive power . He therefore need not be subservient to Leviathan or to those in authority . He has to obey the laws , but in an intelligible sense , he can be said to be governed by laws , not men ; and in that sense free . Unfortunately , the Ideal Rule of Law is an ideal only . We can not always have it that the different organs of government act only in the manner prescribed . In part it is because the traditional doctrine of the Separation of Powers , presupposed by the Ideal Rule of Law , is itself inadequate . But , this apart , the Ideal Rule of Law is impracticable . Even the judges can not comply with its requirements completely . // In applying the law they often have to interpret it . ' In some legal systems , Judicial Interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe it better as Judicial Innovation . The Supreme Court of the United States has acquired authority to interpret the Constitution of the United States with great latitude , and without even being bound by its own decisions . Even in England the common law appears to admit of Judicial Innovation in dramatic , though exceptional , form.2 We should also note , thirdly and briefly , that judges are granted sweeping authority over the behaviour of people actually in court ? I can be sent to prison for contempt of court more or less at the judge 's arbitrary command.3 In these three ways the restrictions stipulated by the Ideal Rule of Law are not imposed on the Judiciary in practice . As regards the Executive , there is a terminological difficulty . If we mean by the Executive ' , the Police , the prison service , the Armed Forces , to-gether with a few diplomatic officials and the private secretaries of Cabinet Ministers , the Rule of Law is both applicable and adequate . But the word Executive ' is commonly extended to cover all people who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges and Members of Parliament . About the activities of this large number of administrative officials the Rule of Law says nothing . This is un-satisfactory . To refuse to give a man a motor licence or a pension is not to exercise a coercive sanction against him : but it is a sanction all the same , and those who have such sanctions at their disposal possess power and need to be guided in their use of it . Again , while an administrator is unlikely to be tempted to deprive a man of life or liberty , administrators are very apt to cast covetous eyes on private property , and have devised various procedures for acquiring it against the owner 's will . Naboth , had he lived in England , would not have lost his life , but he would have lost his vineyard none the less . Administrative officials have authority , and , unlike the executive officials we have been considering , discretion in its use . There is a possibility therefore of its being abused , and need of principles and procedures to secure its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to make officials answerable to their superiors , and their superiors answerable to Parliament , and that apart from this the // discretion of the Executive ought to be left unfettered . But this is to be misled by words . Administrative officials wield power , although not coercive power , and Parliamentary supervision , valuable though it is , can not constitute adequate guidance for its use or safeguard against its abuse in a multitude of individual cases . ' For reasons which will emerge later , z it can not be maintained that the non-coercive power wielded by administrative officials is just the same as the non-coercive power which , as we shall see later , 3 many associations and private individuals exercise . To be refused a car licence or a passport is not like being refused permission to fish on a certain stretch of water . A civil servant dismissed is in a worse case than a salesman out of a job . A compulsory purchase order may be legally valid , but deprive me of my property as unjustly as an Act of Attainder would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law fails to cover any of these cases , because it takes over an inappropriate classification of functions of government , and fails to consider State power which is not coercive power . In due course we shall develop principles which constitute the Rule of Law for the Administration:4 for the present we need only to see that the Ideal Rule of Law , although perfectly adequate for the Executive in the narrow sense of the word , is deficient in preventing the unlawful use of authority by the Executive in its wider sense . The Ideal Rule of Law is confessedly weakest in the restrictions it places upon the Legislature . It is evident that laws can be enacted in quite general terms and yet be wicked . Against this , there is some safeguard in that legislators will not enact laws to other men 's detri-ment if the laws must work to their own detriment also . It might seem tempting , at least to a philosopher influenced by Kant , to hold that laws should be couched in entirely general or universal terms , and not name any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would prevent any really bad laws being passed : tempting , but quite impracticable , and even if practicable , ineffective . How , for i nstance , , could any Railway Act of the last century have been phrased in entirely general terms ? Particular contingencies arise which demand particular remedies , and Parliament has to pass a Private Bill , author-king specific measures , referring to particular places or persons or institutions . Moreover , the formal requirement of being couched in entirely general terms is not enough to secure genuine generality . It is possible , with sufficient ingenuity , to phrase a measure in general // terms but so as in fact to apply to only one case . The formal require-ment of generality or universality does not preclude a covert parti-cularity of application , which entirely defeats the spirit of the Ideal Rule of Law . A German customs tariff in 1902 , in order to avoid a most-favoured-nations obligation , provided for a special rate of duty for " brown or dappled cows reared at a level of at least 300 metres above the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a height of at least Boo metres " . ' And philosophers who have pursued Kant 's principle of universalisability will be able to construct many other examples . The Ideal Rule of Law in its restrictions on the legislative organ of government is thus inadequate as well as impracticable . Locke failed to face the logic of Hobbes ' argument . Locke thought that in securing the supremacy of the Legislature , he was ensuring that the governance of England would no longer be a dominium regale , as the Stuarts had sought to make it , but a dominium politicum et regale.2 He thought of the Legislature as a Parliament , a forum of Constitutional Criticism , which would limit the power of the Crown , and secure that it acted iroALTtKc , s , constitutionally . He did not see , as Hobbes had , that if the Legislature be supreme , then it would not limit the sovereign , but would become itself the sovereign ; and that all the problems of sovereignty which had arisen with the King in the seventeenth century could arise again with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glorious Revolution unseated the monarch , but not the sovereign : and the Americans had to fight further and think harder to bring Leviathan to his knees . The Ideal Rule of Law fails as a complete formula of Constitu-tional Limitation . Nevertheless it is a valuable bulwark against tyranny . If Acts of Attainder are barred , the life and the liberty of the ordinary citizen are safe from Leviathan . The Americans felt that their property was not secure against the fiscal demands of a sovereign Parliament in which they were not represented , but Parliament laid no claim to any prerogative power of arrest or of summary jurisdiction , and the five members would have felt safer in Philadelphia in the eighteenth century than in Westminster in the seventeenth . The Ideal Rule of Law does not provide the whole answer to the problem of securing the right exercise of the supreme authority , but if it can be OFFICIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCRETION II7 modified enough to be applicable , it will provide an answer to the problem of securing the right exercise of the authority to authorise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limitation , not the only one , but the first one , the one which safeguards the citizen against the unbridled use of coercion . This is not all that we want , but it is the condition of everything else that we want , and constitutes , as we shall see , the first and most basic form of Freedom . It draws the teeth of Leviathan , though it does not tame him or make him amenable to reason . The Ideal Rule of Law fails as a complete formulation of the Rule of Law for the same reasons for which the principle of Constitutional Limitation fails . It is partly a matter of language , partly our inability to agree on all questions . Because language is not crystal clear in its application to all cases , we can never dispense with some measure of Judicial Interpretation:I and laws , if they are to receive universal consent , can not deal with contentious matters , and if they do deal with contentious matters , will not only be objected to by some , but may be entirely unjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Ideal Rule of Law , so that we can concede all that is due to the arguments without fixing on an unworkable formula ; and give realistic guidance to officials , as well as effective safeguards to subjects . SECTION 26 OFFICIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCRETION AN OFFICIAL is a person or a body entrusted with some duty or task or commission , granted some authority to carry it out and respon-sible for the exercise of that authority . The word official ' is used in colloquial language primarily of public officials , but the sense here given is wider , and covers representatives of private persons or bodies , trustees , executors of wills , etc . Like an employee , an official has some duty , task or commission assigned to him or under-taken by him , and is responsible for carrying it out : but , unlike some employees , an official has some authority ; his ipse dixit creates or alters obligations or releases people from them . The executors are the owners of the deceased man 's goods and property : they can sell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being vested in a named // person : the judge 's decision instructs and entitles the prison officials to keep a named convict in prison for a specified length of time : the decision of the Pension Board puts the Exchequer under an obligation to pay , and entitles the pensioner to receive certain specified sums of money . In modern life we very often act as officials , or in an official capacity as I shall term it . It is what we characteristically do in offices , in the modern sense of the word , in which it designates a place , a building or a room . We can also use the word office ' , or trust ' or commission " as an abstract noun to designate the combination of duty , discretion , authority , and responsibility ( at least in the general sense ) which an official can be said to hold . In spite of some awkward-ness , I shall use the word office ' in this rather than the modern sense . Commission ' has too military a connotation , trust ' too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in some sense responsible for what he does ( or fails to do ) acting in his official capacity . For to hold an office is to be entrusted to discharge some function , and therefore anything done in an official capacity should be connected with the function entrusted to the official , and therefore it is at least logically proper to ask what the connexion is . To be responsible , as the etymology of the word shows , is to be answerable . The question that a responsible man is able or obliged to answer is Why did you do it ? ' ? or Why did you fail to do it ? ' Since an official 's actions are , or are supposed to be , connected with the office he has undertaken to discharge , it is logically proper to ask him , of any particular official action , why he did it , in order to elicit what , in his view , the connexion is . He is responsible , that is , in a stronger sense than that in which all sane adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be able to give an answer of a certain sort , namely an answer showing how the action in question is connected with the office that he holds . Anyone may ask anybody any question he likes : but he may not obtain a satisfactory answer . The ways in which answers may fail to be satisfactory are of great importance to political as well as to moral philosophy . We have first a set of answers that are , essentially , non-answers . Asked Why did you do it ? ' a man replies , It was not me ' or I did // Not do that ' or That is not what I did ' or I could not help it ' or I did not mean to ' . All these are non-answers : they do not give reasons by the man did the action in question , but , if accepted , make the question , Why did you do it ? ' unaskable . If I can truthfully say , It was not me ' or That is not what I did ' or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean to ' then the question , Why did you do it ? ' no longer arises , and if it is still addressed to me , I no longer have to answer it . I am not responsible , in the literal sense . I may have to answer some other question ( Why did you do whatever it was that you did mean to o ? ' or Why did you not take more care ? ' ) , but I do not have to answer the original question in the form in which it was asked . The form of non-responsibility which has been of concern to moral philosophers has been that corresponding to the plea , I could not help t ' , as a non-answer to the question , Why did you do it ? ' In political philosophy , by contrast , the question is , Why did you fail to do it ? ' and the non-answer is , I was not able to ' . A man can not be blamed for not doing what he was unable to do : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often use the word responsibility ' to mean power ' , as when a man says he wants greater responsibility . In political affairs the plea , I was not able to ' , assumes especial Importance , because it arises not only when the respondent actually tacks the power ( in my sense ) ' to accomplish what was expected , but equally when he lacks the authority ? has not been " empowered " as it is revealingly put . In any constitutional government we seek to limit both the power and the authority of the government , and often may succeed in limiting the latter more than the former . People often ask why the government does not do this that or the other ; abolish poverty , ignorance , drunkenness , crime . The answer , that the govern-ment is not responsible for these things , is felt to be a non-answer . If it is taken as meaning that the government does not have any obligation in these respects , it makes the government appear to be uncaring and unconcerned with the welfare of its subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not have the power to do anything about ameliorating the condition of the people in these respects , it is patently false ? the government may not be able to bring about a perfect state of affairs , but it could do more than it is doing now . The real answer , that there are cogent reasons for limiting the government 's authority which makes it rationally , though not physically impossible , for the government to carry out the requisite measures , is obscured under the // disclaimer of responsibility . The government is , both in the general and in the formal sense of the word , responsible , but has adequate answers to the question , Why do you not do something about it ? ' It may be a specific one ? that the evils engendered by prohibition are worse than those of allowing people to get drunk : it may be the more general one , that in a constitutional State the government 's authority is limited , and that other persons and bodies have the authority and power to bring about the desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authorities for disseminating knowledge and dispelling ignorance . The government may be able to help them , but can not supplant them . It may co-operate with them , but not act in their stead . Poverty could easily be abolished , provided people were not free to choose their own jobs or spend their money as they liked : but once we allow , as we do in a constitutional State , that individuals not the government , shall decide what work a man undertakes , or what goods he shall buy , the government no longer has the authority , or the lawful power , to direct our lives so as to ensure that no one shall be in want . This , of course , does not mean that there is nothing the government can lawfully do : it may still be able to institute schemes for National Assistance , Sick Benefits , Old Age Pensions , and the like : but these are likely to be palliatives , not remedies , because the government , of set constitutional principle , is not in complete control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as it should be . So again with crime , which the government unquestionably has an obligation to prevent , the government could do a lot more to suppress it , by having a national , centrally controlled , police force ; by reversing the burden of proof , so that the accused were guilty unless they could prove themselves innocent ; by authorising the police to use torture to extract information from reluctant informers ; by allowing suspects to be detained on suspicion , pending further enquiries , or until they had satisfied the police of their inoffensiveness . All these methods would be efficacious in reducing crime : each of them is open to serious and weighty objection . The government has a good answer when it is taxed with not employing these means to abolish crime . It is responsible for doing what it lawfully can , but for very good reason we will not give it the authority or the lawful power to finish the job properly . We can not , consistently with Freedom or Constitutionalism , have the government in complete control of events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Constitutionalism , blame the government if everything is not as it should be . We forget that the // government is , not only of its own nature , but of our own devising and desiring , not omnipotent and not all-authoritative , and that there are many things it can not do and even more that we do not really want or trust it to do . A great deal of politics is bad theology . But the govern-ment is not God , nor a mortal god ; we will not even let it be Leviathan . The question , Why did you do it ? ' may fail to elicit a satisfactory answer because it is given a perfectly respectable non-answer . But it may fail in other ways . It may be given an answer , not a non-answer , but an unsatisfactory one . Or it may not be given an answer at all . Anyone may ask anybody any question he likes : but he may not be vouchsafed any sort of answer whatever . Prominent people may be too busy to answer all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U sometimes , their reasons are too discreditable to stand scrutiny , they ve a further reason for refusing to answer . We therefore need to ce on officials a limited legal obligation to answer for their actions certain people . They are not just responsible , but responsible to meone . Administrators are responsible to their cabinet ministers , and these in turn to Parliament . The parliamentary question is the tool for compelling those who are responsible actually to respond . We thus have a further , formal or legal sense of the words responsible ' and responsibility ' , in which a man may be responsible to someone else for some of his actions or inactions , in virtue of a specific duty he owes him , or a commission he has undertaken or an office he has been assigned . Not every man can be responsible to everybody else . Time forbids . The structure of formal responsibilities must therefore be incomplete . Sometimes we lay on officials , e.g. judges , a duty of stating their reasons publicly , but no further duty of answering questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subordinate officials being responsible to superior ones , and they to superior officials still , and so up to the supreme authority . The supreme authority , because it is supreme , is not responsible to anybody : but , we main-tained , it was still responsible in the general sense . This was the principle of Constitutionalism . ' There may not be any body which can call the supreme authority to account for its actions , but we all can criticise them , and are entitled to do so . Rulers are , in my sense of the word , officials ; officials whose duties and authorities are not exactly defined , but who share with minor officials the characteristic feature of having their actions open to critical assessment and appraisal . We // may not be able to say precisely what the duties of the government are , or what the limits of their authority are , because all the residual imprecision of human affairs remains at the top , even if we have been able to assign definite duties and authorities lower down . Neverthe-less , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the authority of the government is completely unlimited . Contrary to what the Roman lawyers maintained , and in so far as the analogy between public and private law is not misleading , to possess the government is not like owning a piece of property but like holding a trust . Whether formally or only generally responsible , an official answers for his official actions by giving reasons for them . These reasons have to be of a certain sort . It is not enough for an official , as it would be for a private individual , I to say simply , I wanted to ' . An official is responsible , not merely in having to give reasons why he did , as a matter of fact , make the decision in question , but in being obliged to have reasons why he should have acted as he did . He has not only to explain his actions , but to justify them . He has to give the reasons why he did them , which were also reasons why he should have done them , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly . These reasons , however , may not be conclusive . They may not even be sound . Characteristically , there are arguments for and against every course of action , and often the arguments are fairly evenly balanced , and it is difficult to decide which are weightier . We may disagree with the man 's judgement , and find the arguments on the other side more convincing : but even so , we are not on this score alone entitled to reject his account of his actions or to blame him for them . For human judgement is fallible . It may be that we are wrong , and he is right . Even if we discount this possibility , we can not blame a person who exercises his discretion reasonably , though in our considered view , wrongly . For if we are not prepared to excuse a bona fide error of judgement , we ought not to have given him any latitude or discretion , but ought to have laid down ourselves what it was that we wanted him to do . Therefore it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his actions , that he has not completely convinced us that they were the right actions for him to have done , or that we should have done the same thing in his place . We must be less exacting than that . How much less exacting we should be depends on circumstances ; on what office the man had been entrusted with ; the risks and rewards // of the enterprise ; the cogency of the reasons he acted upon ; how far a reasonable man could discount the force of the arguments on the other side . We expect a higher standard of judgement from those entrusted with great offices of State than from those undertaking minor enterprises : if a man has only flimsy arguments to justify his actions , or if he has overlooked obvious and fatal objections , we are ready to impute blame , but where the arguments are very nearly balanced we can not be extreme to mark what is done amiss . However much less exacting we are , there is a certain minimum which we demand in any account of the exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruptly , or from fear or for favour . A man must not decide for no reason or for reasons of selfinterest or because he is frightened or because he has a personal liking for somebody or other . If a man does any of these things , or if he fails to exercise a certain degree of competence , depending on the circumstances , he is failing in the trust reposed in him . Even if he is not responsible to anyone , and not legally answerable for his official actions , he is still responsible in the general sense and open to Constitutional Criticism for his failure even to attempt to reach the right decision . SECTION 27 RATIONALITY AND UNIVERSALISABILITY TILE Rule of Law is intended in its internal aspect as a guide to the authorities on how they shall exercise their authority , and in its external aspect as a basis for criticising and appraising their decisions . Authority is vested in persons because the judgement of a person is a better way of deciding a dispute than any other procedure , better because more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in persons with the idea that they shall use it rightly , and it is the idea of the right decision and the reasonable exercise of discretion , which guides us in seeking to guide those in authority . We can not in general say what the right decision is ? if we could , we should have no need of arbitration to adjudicate our disputes ? but we have some idea of what the right decision must be like ; or at least , what right reasoning is like , and hence what a series of right decisions must be like , and the sort of arguments an authority would adduce if it was trying to reach the right decision . // Arbitrary decisions can not be reasonable ; and if , on a particular occasion , an arbitrary decision happens to be the right one , it is so only by coincidence . We saw earlier ' that arbitrary decisions were not satisfactory because they were neither predictable nor stable . We see now that they are unsatisfactory for the further reason that they can not be reasonable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a judge decides a case purely on whim , or from fear , or for favour , we know that he has not reasoned rightly and that his decision is no better , and in many respects worse , than that yielded by the toss of a coin . In one sense of please ' quod placuit principi is just what does not have the force of lawfulness , for in that sense of please ' it is confessedly irrational , and if the de-cisions of a princeps were all totally irrational , we should have gained nothing , and lost a lot , by setting him in authority . It was only because of the essential non-arbitrariness of arbitrators that they could play a useful part in decision procedures , and we can therefore reasonably demand that they shall not be arbitrary but reasonable in arbitrating our disputes . Many men have despaired of demanding that our judges should be reasonable or just . They have felt that if they can not tie them down completely , they can not tie them down at all . Reason for them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of convincing another , or at least of confidently convicting him of error , every time , they can not hope to convince him ever , and it is simply not worth making the attempt . Such an attitude entirely misconceives the nature of reason , and , for good measure , commits the logical fallacy of confusing contraries with contradictories . Without going into a lengthy discussion of what it is to be reasonable , 2 let me bluntly state , what I have assumed from the outset , 3 that some men are to some extent reasonable some of the time , although it is not the case that all men are altogether reasonable ( in the sense of infallible ' ) all the time . Were it not so , we could have no community , no decision procedure , and certainly no arbitrators . It is intelligible therefore to lay down certain general rules for the guidance of those in authority , even though we can not specify fully what decisions are the right ones . The judicial oath , to administer Justice " without fear or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say precisely what Justice is , or what constitute just decisions , // it does say some of the things that Justice is not . We can imagine cases in which we should have no hesitation in saying that the judge had broken his judicial oath . Therefore the oath is meaningful ; and , as we know full well , of great importance . We can rule out certain types of reasoning or non-reasoning as contrary to what those in authority are commissioned to do : we can stipulate that they shall not allow themselves to be swayed by argu-ments of fear or of favour ; that they shall not decide without consider-ing any arguments at all ; and that they shall not be swayed by any considerations of self-interest . All these are negative characterisations of right reasoning ? we are saying some of the things that right reasoning is not . We can also , in a more positive approach , say some of the things ( although not all the things ) that right reasoning is . Right reasoning is rational , relevant , and universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prejudices , should be the same for one man as for another , for speaker and for hearer alike ? this is why the jury-box is a usable filter to separate out what has been reasonably proved from the private interests , personal prejudices , and the idiosyncrasies of the individual jurors . Right reasoning is sus-ceptible of interpersonal assessment and criticism , because it claims to be rational . Although I may , as a matter of fact , be in a better position to judge than anybody else , and may indeed be a better judge than anybody else , I am not in a logically privileged position , as I am when 1 am reporting my own feelings , sensations or perceptions . Subject to some qualifications , I know what I like , I know what I am feeling , and I know what sense-experience I am having , better than anybody else , and necessarily better than anybody else , just simply in virtue of being me . I am logically privileged in these cases in a way I am not logically privileged when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right conclusion . In these latter cases , although I may be legally privileged , as a legislator or a judge is , in the sense that what I say goes so far as the law is concerned , I am not logically privileged . That is , it is meaningful to impugn my decision ( say that it is wrong ) even if it is not feasible , in the given legal system , to reverse my decision ( have its authority annulled ) . ' Right reasoning is relevant . Any conclusions I claim to have reached by right reasoning I must be able to support by adducing some facts in its favour , and it can not be true that any fact would be as good as any other fact ; for then my conclusions would be quite // arbitrary . ' Therefore non-arbitrariness implies some standard of relevance . It is not , however , possible to formulate exact criteria of relevance or irrelevance.2 But we can make the one point that where we are having to decide a particular issue , whether this man should go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public highway , we must ascer-tain some facts about this man or this car , and base our judgement on them . Else our reasoning , whatever its other merits , will not be rele-vant , and our conclusions will not be applicable to the particular case in question.3 Right reasoning is universal . This is commonly understood in a number of different ways . It may mean simply that right reasoning is non-egocentric , as we have seen above.4 Another , related , way of more immediate concern to us , in which right reasoning is universal is that although it is in one sense particular , as we have seen in the preceeding paragraph , it is in another sense non-particular : in reasoning about this topic , this situation , this problem , our arguments should be based on general features , characteristics or circumstances , not on the bare fact that the topic , situation , or problem is this one . Although we do often reason about particulars , it is always in virtue of the particulars possessing certain characteristics , not ( if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For us to be able to argue or even talk about it , the Tolle must be a Tot6v8e , and it is in virtue of a particular 's being a particular Tot6vae that we can talk or argue rationally about it at all . For while I can refer to this Tolle by means of a token-reflexive word , such as the word this ' , I can not , without the use of general terms , say anything about it ; and if I am to argue about it rationally , since rational arguments are ideally non-egocentric , they must be formulated in non-egocentric terms ; and therefore without the use of token-reflexives , which are essentially egocentric , as Russell 's illuminating name " egocentric particulars " 5 shows . lloyoi , even more when they are arguments , reasons , rationes than when they // are verba , words , are inherently applicable and re-applicable on different occasions to different particular instances of some general form or type . With persons and particular situations in human affairs there is a difficulty , if ; as I maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not completely specify the features that characterise a person or situation , and however fully we have specified it , we may always have left out some relevant feature . Hence the dialectical nature of argument in the humanities . Hence also the belief of some philosophers that political reasoning , like that of history and the other humanities , is concrete rather than abstract . No finite set of " abstract " characteristics can exhaust either all that can be truthfully and relevantly said of a person or a human situation , or all the infinite facets of a personality , or the infinite complexity embodied concretely in a particular person or a particular situation . Nevertheless , although no finite set of characteristics characterises a person or a human situation without remainder , when we argue about situations or problems in human affairs , it is in virtue of some of the general characteristics or features of the case that we adduce the arguments that we do . The conclusion , therefore , of a rational argument , although it may be about one particular topic , and may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to particulars egocentrically , and not in virtue of any general characteristic , is , if not already in universal terms , universalisable . A man who claims that a particular picture is a good picture , but allows that another picture might be like it in every respect , except that it was not good , ' shows thereby that he has not been reasoning rationally , and that his putative value-judgement This is a good picture ' is not a value-judgement , because not a judgement at all . Similarly , a historian discussing some counterfactual conditional , e.g. , If Hannibal had marched on Rome , he would have taken it ' , would be convicted of a serious irrationality if he then went on to allege , however , that there could have been another situation exactly like that of Rome in Hannibal 's time in all respects , and another commander , exactly like Hannibal in personal qualities , resources and all other respects , and yet this other commander would not have taken this other Rome . We may therefore lay it down as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is based on universal characteristics of the topic argued about , and as a necessary condition of a conclusion 's being the conclusion of a rational arguI28 RATIONALITY AND UNIVERSALISABILITY ment that it should be in some sense universalisable . Some philosophers have suggested that it is also a sufficient condition of at least a valuejudgement 's being a value-judgement . This seems doubtful . For our purpose , a necessary condition is enough . The sense in which rationally arrived at conclusions must be universalisable has raised many difficulties . One , which is important for our present purpose , is whether the universalisability is a practical universalisability , such that the speaker should be able , on demand , to universalise his conclusion , stating exactly and completely what the relevant universal characteristics are ; or whether the universalisability is only in principle , so that if there were a case exactly the same in all relevant ( but unstated ) respects , then the same conclusion would follow . The requirement of universalisability in the former sense is a more stringent one . It requires that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the instances of which are qualitatively identical so far as the argument is concerned , and therefore with the some conclusion holding of them all . The latter sense requires only that if different conclusions hold in two cases , there must be some relevant difference between the cases to account for the discrepancy . We can , once again , ' use quantifiers to make the point clear , and express the difference between these two requirements of universalisability in terms of a reversal of the order of the two quantifiers ( x ) and ( Ry ) .2 It is in fact only the weak requirement of universalisability that we have shown to be a necessary condition of a conclusion 's being the conclusion of a rational argument . The picture enthusiast was proved ' Compare ? 8 , p . Son . 2 In this case we need the higher-order predicate calculus so that we may quantify over characteristics . Let x range over particular cases , and G range over characteristics ( including conjunctions of characteristics ) of cases , and let C(x) be the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Then the strong require- , ment is ( 3 G ) ( x ) G(x) C(x) and the weak is ( x ) ( 3 G ) , , , C(x) , , , G(x) which is the same as ( x ) ( 3G ) G(x) C(x) In the strong requirement there has to be a set of characteristics G , such that every case x which is a case of G is also a case of C. In the weak requirement we only need that if any x is not a case of C there is some relevant characteristic G which it also lacks . We can not formalise criteria of relevance , which are none the less of the greatest importance in the application of the principle . See below , ? 29 , p. 135 , ? 30 , pp. 136-7 , ? 55 , esp . p. 235 . See also J. R. Lucas , The Lesbian Rule ' , Philosophy , 1955 , esp . pp. 202-13. // irrational not because he could not specify fully and precisely those characteristics the possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ? , but because he was prepared to deny that another picture was good although he did not allow that there was any respect in which it differed from the picture that , he maintained , was good . If , as many philosophers believe , there are only a finite number of relevant characteristics , the two requirements of universalisability differ only in approach , and come to the same thing in the end . If , however , as I maintain , human affairs are infinitely complex , then the two principles of universalisability are radically different . Even in the former case the end is so far distant that the different approaches have importantly different consequences . The reversal in the order of the quantifiers , which makes the difference between the strong and the weak requirement of universalisability makes also the difference between finite and infinite . In the strong requirement , in which the order of the quantifiers was ( 3 G ) ( x ) we have to specify the relevant features ? G  --  before the occurrence of a particular case x ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not , if we are to have our language perfectly precise , be more than a finite conjunction of features . In the weak requirement , however , in which the order of the quantifiers was ( x ) ( 3 G ) we do not have to specify the relevant feature until after the occurrence of each case x , when it may be any one of an infinite list of features , and although in each case G may be only finitely specified after the event , it may be a different G for each x , and the range of x is infinite . Thus the strong requirement , because it requires us to specify the relevant features first and to have completed our specification before any cases arise , ties us down to only a finite number of features that we can mention as relevant : whereas the weak requirement , in allowing us to have our say after the occurrence of each case , leaves us free always to pick out further features of the case in question as relevant ; and in giving us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of potentially relevant features infinite . SECTION 28 RULES OF NATURAL JUSTICE RIGHT reasoning can not be completely characterised , and therefore , if we are to be definite , we have to concentrate not on saying what it // is , but on saying some of the things that it is not . In the face of human imperfection , we articulate the Rule of Law partly in terms of procedures designed not to secure that absolute Justice will be done but to be a safeguard against the worst sort of injustice . Injustice rather than Justice " wears the trousers " in political philosophy , because , being fallible , we can not say in advance what the just decision will always be , and , living among selfish men , we can not always secure that it will be carried out . So , for the sake of definiteness , we adopt a negative approach , and lay down procedures to avoid certain likely forms of injustice , rather than aspire to all forms of Justice . The rules of Natural Justice are general rules of procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual cases . They have been formulated with legal adjudications ' in view rather than any other sort of political2 dispute , but they should not be restricted to disputes that are decided by the courts of law . The rules of Natural Justice require that no man shall be judge in his own cause ; that the judge shall hear both sides of the case ; that the judge shall give full consideration to the case ; that the judge shall exclude all irrelevant considerations from his mind while reaching a decision ; that like cases shall be decided alike ; that cases once settled shall not be reopened , though , according to some authorities , there should be some right of appeal ; that not only shall justice be done but that it shall be seen to be done ; that the judgement shall include not only the bare decision , but the reasons which led to it.3 These rules guard against certain , although not all , defects which may afflict our decision procedures . The rule of precedents , that like cases shall be treated alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled shall not be reopened , are , as we have seen , 4 necessary conditions of any decision procedure . Provision for appeals recognises the fallibility of human judgement , even that of the most judicious of judges . But , as we saw in Section 5 , not all decisions can be subject to appeal . The requirements that proceedings be in public and that reasons be given for decisions is primarily a safeguard against the authorities abusing their position by taking decisions for the wrong , and particularly for corrupt , reasons ; 5 it also , though only secondarily , reflects our ideal // of ' Political Liberty , that everybody should be free to be , in some minimal sense , " in on " all decisions made by the body politic , if only by being able to know what they are , and to follow the reasoning by which they were reached . We can , alternatively , view this as a precondition lir the effective operation of Constitutional Criticism . The requirement is not an absolute , although a general one : sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to protect the intimate interests of the individual concerned from adverse publicity , and sometimes even Parliament goes into secret session . These are exceptional cases , where the circumstances warrant our making exceptions . There are , however , more general arguments in favour of secrecy , or at least privacy , ' and these lead to a general conflict of goods , and provided we can have other securities against abuse , we may be prepared to compromise the minimal extent of public participation afforded by publicity of proceedings for the sake of efficiency and enterprise . One general type of such security is the requirement of Responsibility discussed in Section 27 . The rule that no man shall be judge in his own cause is a particular case of the requirement that arbitration shall be impartial ; which in turn is a particular case of the requirement that a decision , if it is to be reasonable and right , must be based only on relevant considerations , and not on irrelevant ones . Considerations depending merely on the personal interests of the arbitrator are irrelevant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be right reasoning , and can not , except by coincidence , lead to a right decision . ' The principle is easy to apply in its traditional field of applicationin " causes " which have been brought to a court of law for adjudication ; for these the concept of interest is reasonably determinate , and it is reasonably easy to secure that a non- " interested " party shall have authority to arbitrate . But the general concept of interest is indeterminate , and liable to expand in unexpected directions.3 Is a judge , committing for contempt a man who has flouted that judge 's orders , really a disinterested party ? He has no pecuniary interest , true . 14uut if his amour propre is involved , is he not really as interested as if lw had some financial stake in the outcome ? 4 What of a Minister of the Grown , listening to objections to schemes put forward by his own Ministry ? As a politician seeking political success , he has a great Interest in the success of his Ministry 's policies . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern in self-advancement merge beyond disentangling . ' The concept of interest can be expanded until it becomes vacuous . All good men are interested that right , as they see it , shall be done , and truth , as they believe it , shall prevail . Although we can distinguish disinterested interests from interested ones , it is too difficult a distinction to draw for us to be able to use in a rule of procedure . We can only specify certain sorts of interests , and debar those who have such interests from taking certain sorts of decision where those interests are involved . The rule that the judge shall hear both sides of the case , audi alteram partem , is based on three principles : first incomplete rationality and incomplete information ; secondly respect for the individual ; and thirdly Political Liberty . There are many considerations which an authority will not have entertained , many facts which it will not know ; among them may be crucial ones , which , if only they were brought to the authority 's attention , would lead it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely to have thought of cogent considerations , and to know the relevant facts , is the person whose interests are in jeopardy , that is the party opposing the decision . Therefore we shall avoid bad decisions best if we ensure that each potential decision , before it is finally decided , is exposed to what is likely to be the strongest possible criticism of it . By subjecting each potential decision to the most stringent test under the most adverse conditions , we shall weed out all those that will not really stand up . If , having heard the best case that the other side can make , an arbitrator decides against him , his decision is not likely to be wrong simply because he failed to notice some weighty considerations , or was not apprised of some crucial fact . Besides this recipe for avoiding injustice , we think we owe it to a man as a human being to engage in argument with him , and allow him to engage in argument with us , rather than take decisions about him behind his back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rational agent , able to appreciate the rationale of our decisions about him , possibly willing to co-operate in carrying them out . So a judge , before passing sentence on a convicted prisoner , asks him first if he // has anything to say ; for even a convicted prisoner , although altogether subject to the coercive power of the State , is still a human being , not a sack of potatoes ; and a judge should talk to him , and let him talk back in turn , and not merely talk to others about him , as he might about an inaminate object . The argument from Political Liberty , that a man has a right to be heard , in order that he may have the opportunity of shaping the decisions of State in the direction he wants , is a much wider-ranging argument . But it is not primarily concerned with Natural Justice , and therefore we defer it until later . ' SECTION 29 EQUITY AND LEGALITY THE two principles of universalisability generate two ideals , which I shall call Equity ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponds to the weak principle of universalisability , that of Legality to the strong . The ideally equitable decision is purely rational , taking into consideration all the relevant factors of the case:3 the decision altogether in accord with Legality is purely deductive , basing itself only on the finite number of features antecedently specified as relevant by the statute . If we adopt the weak principle of universalisability , the only restriction upon the decisions which might be rationally reached by the judges is that similar cases shall be treated similarly , that is , the rule of precedents of the common law . By the rule of precedents , a judge is obliged either to decide the case before him the same way as similar cases in the past , or to " distinguish " it , that is , to find some feature of the present case not possessed by previous cases which justifies its being decided the other way . The logical form is of the case arising first and the principles applying being stated afterwards . If , on the other hand , we adopt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges can give decisions which are rational is to give them in accordance with a code . The code may be a // complete system of statute law enacted by the legislature , like the Code Napoleon ; or it may be judge-made law , but antecedently promul-gated , like the Praetorian Edict . But , however authorised , it has the logical form of the principles being stated first and the cases arising afterwards . We can also use the two principles of universalisability , with the associated distinction between finite and infinite specifiability , to define the pure cases of adjudication and legislation . Adjudication is concerned essentially with the particular , legislation with the general . An adjudication , if it is to be rational , must be universalisable in the weak sense , not necessarily in the strong sense : whereas legislation constitutes a principle , universalised in the strong sense , covering an indefinite number of particular cases ; in the language of the logicians , adjudications are concerned with " closed " classes of named persons , legislation with an " open " class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no antecedent specification of what constitutes a relevant factor ; though , of course , if we give a justification it must be a finite one , and only refer to a finite number of factors as relevant ; but the justification is given ex post facto , and we do not have to lay down in advance of the actual situation what is to count as a relevant factor . In legislating , however , we are essentially specifying in advance what features are relevant , and how cases char-acterised by them are to be treated . Adjudication is concerned with only a definite number ( usually only one ) of named particular persons , but with an indefinite number of un-named factors being possibly relevant : legislation is concerned with an indefinite number of un-named persons , but with only a definite number of specified factors being relevant . If an adjudication is to be reasonable and right , it must be reached by argument , itself based on the past actions2 of the persons concerned ; else it is still possible that they might act so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argument to apply . If legislation is to be // properly so called , it must be about the legal consequences of the future actions of people . For only these constitute a genuinely open class . The pure cases of adjudication and legislation do not occur in practice . An adjudicator can not help legislating once he starts recording his decisions . For although he decides a case after the event , and is not tied down by any criteria of relevance promulgated beforehand , if once he states his decision he states it in only finite terms , and this statement is antecedent to future possible cases . The judge has there-fore committed himself to deciding future cases which are the same in all relevant respects in the same way as this case ; and hence , a judge , by recording his decision does lay down how an indefinite number of similar cases will be treated , and this is legislation ( albeit on only a very small scale ) in our sense . Legislation also can not help but adjudicate . However forward-looking it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their expectations , a future alteration of the law may affect a man 's present situation and alter or undo the effect of his past dispositions . Moreover , even the most general measures can not but apply to particular persons , and legislators can not help having a fairly shrewd idea of some of the particular people who will be affected by their general enactnents . It is only because particular people will be affected that there is agitation for a change of law . Therefore , quite apart from difficulties about the interpretation of statutes , which we will discuss later , ' we must allow that every piece of legislation should also be regarded as being partly an adjudication too . We can distinguish the adjudicative and legisla-tive aspects of a decision , rather than classify every decision as being either the one or the other . SECTION 3o THE FOUR JUDGES W I. CAN illustrate the interplay between the ideals of Equity and Legality , and between the adjudicative and legislative aspects of decisions by recounting an imaginary tale of four judges , Judex I , Judex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I is the ideal customary law judge . He is a good man who // lives in his tent and judges Israel righteously . Every morning he goes to the gate of the city , and there hears all the disputes the children of Israel bring him ; and after having heard what either side has to say , gives his decision , for the one party or the other , as the Lord saith unto him . And then goes on to the next case . Judex I has a second cousin , Basileus , who lives in Greece , and gives Themistes , awards to his people as seems best to him . Themistes are divinely inspired , separate , isolated judgements in particular cases . ' If Basileus had been as good a man as Judex I , all would have been well , but unfortunately the old Adam in him got the upper hand , and his Themistes remained separate , isolated judgements in particular cases , but were no longer divinely inspired , and in due course his people came to suspect that he was abusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judex II is the original common law judge . Judgement is still divinely inspired , and so much so that a judge can not articulate at all the motives of the spirit that moves him . But when he decides a case , he says what he has decided , although he does not say why . His decision is recorded , and it is agreed that similar cases must be decided in the same way , although when a new case arises , Judex II , after having conceded that it does seem prima facie to resemble some case he has decided previously , may go on to say , But there is a further feature of this case which makes all the difference ' . In course of time Judex II gives way to Judex III , the judge of the law reports . Judex III not only says what he has decided , but also , to the best of his ability , why . Various considerations led to this . It was partly that Judex III found that having to put his reasons in writing aided clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reasoning to the critical appraisal of others , both in order that he might learn to do it better , and that a common consensus of judicial opinion might be established , so that the many different judges , of whom Judex III was now composed , could keep in step . It was also that subjects and litigants liked to be given reasons.2 Not only was it a help to them in anticipating what Judex III might decide next , but they had found the bleak what ' of Judex II 's decisions not altogether satisfactory . They had not always been convinced of the relevance of the differentiating feature . Some cynics had said that they were no better off than under Judex I , because if Judex II was minded to give an unjust decision , // then no matter how clear the precedents , he could always manage to distinguish the new case by saying , But it was on a Tuesday in August in Dover ' , or some such . If the object of the exercise was to ensure that J udex reached his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should state what his reasons had in fact been . And this Judex IlI was asked to do . Judex IV is trusted even less . No divine inspiration there . All he has to do is to look at the regulations , and see what the answer is . He is the ideal legal code or statute law judge . He does not have to be wise or more than minimally good . His function is merely to certify that a certain regulation applies to this case , and make the appropriate parti-cular order . ' The subsumption of the particular case under the general rule is entirely " mechanical " and can be checked by anybody , in-chiding the parties to the dispute ; so that it would be quite clear if the judge were going wrong . Judex IV is a humble man , conscious of his human failings and fallibility ; and is glad that his Assignment of Responsibility makes it more or less impossible to go wrong . Many modern judges have Judex IV as their ideal , and many subjects , in the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only satisfactory way of administering Justice . But , as Judex comes down from his pedestal , it is necessary for Law-giver to ascend to the throne ; and as the one becomes more mortal , more human , more humble , the other becomes more Olympian , more divine , more pre-eminent . Moses and Hammurabi , Solon , the Decemvirs , Justinian , and Napoleon cast long shadows down the course of history ; some spoke with God ; some claimed divine in-spiration ; some were accorded divine honours ; all were elevated above the common run of humanity , and needed to be , if they were to carry out their task . And in fact , not actually being divine , their efforts at law-making left a lot to be desired . For the complexity of human affairs makes them not only impossible to describe with complete precision but impossible also to prescribe for with complete fairness ; impossible at least in practice , and perhaps also in principle . For if human beings and human affairs are infinitely complex , while their capacities to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even a Law-giver , can envisage all the possibilities there are , or provide for each one separately in advance . If his language were absolutely precise , so that he could lay down general , but exact , provisions for the future , about whose application to any particular case there could // be no doubt , there would still be many combinations of circumstances which he had not considered , and which if he had considered he would have decided in the opposite way from that laid down by the general provisions he had enacted . " And because the dangers of a State can never be all foreseen by any company of men , by reason of the infinite circumstances of humane actions and accidents , therefore they can not be all caution 'd in Positive Laws . " ' Dolus later in generalibus . No man can generalise safely . For men 's generalisations , being the generalisa-tions of finite beings , contain only a finite number of characterising terms , and are therefore , in the pejorative sense of the word , abstract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concrete situation demands . Judex I , Judex II , and Judex III may therefore declare a more just decision in the individual cases they consider , than Judex IV can , completely fettered as he is by Law-giver , who , however much wiser he is than Judex , has to divide his attention over all cases in general , instead of concentrating it on only a few cases in particular , and therefore may well , as regards these few particular cases , be wrong . Only an infinitely wise Being , God , can be an adequate Law-giver , being a perfect Law-giver and a perfect Judge , laying down laws that were just in all cases , and giving judgements that were just in each . Mortal men , not being God , nor having God available in this life , either as Judge or as Law-giver , in the sense of words here used , must compromise . No man is good enough or wise enough for us to be entirely happy to have him either as Judex I or as Law-giver giving laws to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right decisions reached by rational argument goes , we are best served by Judex III , subject to the usual safeguards of appellate courts , and perhaps with the added authority ( which the Supreme Court and , now , 2 the House of Lords have ) of reversing the palpably wrong decisions of his predecessors . But there are other arguments which lead us to Legality as the chief bulwark of the Rule of Law . SECTION 31 LEGALITY : THE INTERNAL ASPECT LEGALITY provides both guidance for the rulers and protection for the ruled . Historically , it was for the sake of both of these together that // Legality was demanded . Judex I became corrupt , and therefore was replaced by Judex IV to whom no latitude was allowed . ' Happily now , we no longer need Legality as a safeguard against corruption : and against errors made in good faith , the courts of appeal are equally adequate and in many ways better . Nevertheless , it is often felt that Legality is the only principle an official can adopt if he is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself demands strict adherence to the principle of Legality . Although we have distinguished two senses of universalisability , many philosophers do not draw the distinction , and think that there is only one principle , the strong principle , and that this is the hallmark of rationality . To be rational a decision must be in accordance with a rule , and the only alternative is to be entirely arbitrary.2 Reasoning then is construed to mean solely deductive reasoning , and all valid arguments , if set out in full , are thought to he deductive arguments , in which the conclusions follow from the premisses in virtue of the meanings of the words involved . Closely linked with this theory of reasoning is a theory of language , that the application of language is always either completely automatic or else entirely arbitrary . These two theories give rise to the doctrine of mechanical legalism , which holds that a judge must decide particular issues by subsuming them under some law ( so that the decision follows deductively from the law cited ) , because otherwise he would be acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what a judge is to decide in all circumstances , because if it grants the judge any discretion at all , it gives him no guidance whatsoever , and leaves the issue to be decided at his whim . The theory that all reasoning is deductive reasoning is false , 3 and so is the theory that the application of language is always either com-pletely automatic or else entirely arbitrary . We have already4 seen that // language is not completely precise , so that however carefully we formu-late a law there are still some cases to which its application is not clear or automatic : so that Judex IV , in spite of his ideals , must on occasion interpret the law , and not merely apply it . ' And therefore even he must on occasion exercise discretion , for to interpret is to exercise some sort of discretion . Every judge must have some discretion ? obviously , for that is why we have them . It is in fact perfectly feasible to give directives to judges on how they are to use their authority , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Parlia-ment directs that the penalty for certain motoring offences shall be disqualification unless there are " special circumstances " . It is left to the judges to decide whether there are special circumstances ; but it is quite clear to them that they may not deem any circumstances to be special circumstances , and that they may not let a man off more lightly merely because disqualification is in their view too severe a penalty . Language is richly provided with words and phrases that give guidance without completely withholding discretion ; as is only to be expected , seeing that language is a means of communication between rational agents , every one of whom may be expected to be able to use his nous to some extent . Even the simplest everyday instructions ? Go to the grocers and buy half a pound of butter ' ? do not prescribe the exact pattern of physical behaviour , and leave the hearer some discretion in the way in which he carries out the commission . The greater discretion vested in a judge is nothing out of the ordinary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latitude that is inherent in most language ; and what is to be expected if human beings are rational agents rather than computers or automata . Hence laws need not be formulae which are either rigidly applicable or else useless . They can , and in fact do , contain many policy-directing words and phrases which tell the judges how they are to give their decisions , although they will still need to use their own judgement in each particular case : ' reason-able ' , foreseeable ' , without due care and attention ' , without due consideration of other road-users ' , in good faith ' ? it would be absurd to maintain that these , and many other words and phrases , were meaningless , or that laws containing them could not be applied , except purely arbitrarily ; but such words and phrases do not always apply themselves , in the way in which some philosophers feel des-criptive language ideally should , and we may on occasion , perhaps on // many occasions , raise the question , Who is to say ? ' whether such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreseeable , etc . To make the question answerable on every occasion on which it arises , we need to have a judge to give an authoritative application of the word or phrase on that occasion . But this does not mean that the word or phrase has no meaning apart from the judge 's interpretation , or that he could in any case whatever give whatever interpretation he liked to it . ' Contrary , therefore , to the doctrine of mechanical legalism , that discretion must be either non-existent or else absolute , it is both possible and necessary that judges should be granted some discretion Without their thereby being given a completely free hand . Judex IV its not , so far as logic goes , the only alternative to Judex I. There are other arguments for Legality , but we can not argue on logical grounds from the nature of the concept of adjudication that the ideal of Legality is , simply , identical with that of Rationality , and alone is opposed to irrationality and arbitrariness . Judex II and Judex III can exist as fairminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legality is thus not the same as rationality or Constitutionalism . It is not to be equated with the Rule of Law . There still are reasons for assigning only limited responsibilities with limited discretion to officials , z and , in particular , to judges:3 but these do not require us to make Legality into an absolute ; and , indeed , there are many reasons why we should not . For Legality , where it differs from Equity , will be less just , and this is bad , even from the internal point of view of the officials who administer the law . After all , the whole object of the exercise is to produce right decisions . It may be wise to qualify that ideal by counsels of imperfection , but hardly to replace it . Moreover , even the score of expediency , inequitable decisions should be avoided . For the law will be effective only if it is generally regarded as just by the public at large . It will forfeit their respect if it departs too far from the values which the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Human nature can not by any means subsist without the association of individuals : and that association never could have place were no regard paid to the laws of equity and justice . " 4 // Judges in practice pay great regard to justice , much more than many of them like to admit . Many judges see themselves in the role of Judex IV , and all judges consider themselves bound by the rule of precedents . Nevertheless when faced with a law , whether statute or some pre-viously decided case , which outrages their sense of justice , they tend to " interpret it away " . They seize on any feature they can of the case before them which they can use to " distinguish " this case from those where an unjust decision would , according to pre-existing law , have to be given . Thus , paying lip-service to Legality , judges often succeed in advancing the cause of Justice . There are advantages in maintaining always the semblance of Legality , even while deciding the case on its substantial merits , ' but clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legality therefore is not for them the sole and sufficient principle . Judges are not alone in loving Justice . Not only the citizenry at large , but officials of the executive arm of government , are moved by considerations of Justice and Mercy more than by a strict regard for the letter of the law . And therefore , if the law is inflexible , and the judge has no discretion to mitigate its asperities where Justice or common sense requires it , those persons who are actually in a position to exercise discretion , even if they are not in theory authorised to do so , will . People insist on being reasonable , and if judges can not be , then executive officials must . Thus the police in respect of the Traffic Acts . If exceeding the speed limit is made an offence with no excuses allowed , then if a man really has a good excuse ? e.g. rushing a patient to hospital ? the police will not prosecute . Similarly with many parking offences , too little discretion on the part of the magistrates has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end , Legality is self-defeating . The whole point of having judges is that decisions can not be given according to the rule-book , and someone must have dis-cretion : and the principle provision of Process of Law is to put the // discretion in the hands of the Judiciary . But if we then , in deference to Legality , try to remove discretion from the Judiciary , we are defeating the whole object of the exercise . The Rule of Law can not be reduced to the principle of Legality . Legality is a form of Constitutional Limitation which although often useful as a safeguard against abuse , can not be always adequate . So far as the internal aspect of the Rule of Law is concerned , Equity rather than Legality is the hallmark of rationality , and while , in view of the imperfection of rulers and judges , we may on occasion regard Legality as a safer guide , it is always one of limited application only , and we must be ready to rely on other prin-ciples and procedures to secure our decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is concerned not only to give guidance to the rulers in taking decisions , but to give protection to the ruled , who are also human beings , also fallible and finite ones . They need the protection not only of limits and definiteness , but of intelligibility and manipulability , so as to enable them to make and carry out their own plans , as well as providing them with arguing points for when they need to criticise the rulers ' decisions . These needs give a different aspect to the Rule of Law ? its external aspect . We view the State from the many different points of view of private citizens , those who are not officials , or not acting in an official capacity . Whereas the unifying theme of the internal aspect of the Rule of Law is Rationality , that of the external aspect is Freedom . Freedom yields further arguments for Legality : Freedom plays an integral part in our structure of legal rights and duties : and it is on Freedom that our notion of property is based . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Freedom and Reason complement each other : Freedom is a good only for rational agents ; and only for free beings does the possibility of rational action arise . SECTION 32 FREEDOM tt E concept of Freedom is difficult to elucidate . As we shall show ter , ' it is necessarily two-faced , one man 's freedom being opposed to // other men 's , and at different times different emphasis has been put on different aspects . Also it is a word with strong emotional connotations , and in many different conflicts in the course of history , protagonists have sought to annex the word freedom ' as a slogan for their side . ' Freedom ' has thus acquired many different senses , and often we can best determine what exactly is being meant , by considering what is not being meant ; what the word ' freedom ' is being opposed to . Nevertheless , Freedom is not simply a negative concept . There is a common strand running through all its uses , and it is because of this that we value it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of Freedom is that in which a rational agent is free when he is able to act as seems best to him without being subject to external constraint on his actions . Freedom is a necessary condition of rationality , of action , of achievement . Not to be free is to be frustrated , impotent , futile . To be free is to be able to shape the future , to be able to translate one 's ideals into reality , to actualise one 's potentialities as a person . Not to be free is not to be responsible , not to be able to be responsive , not to be human . Freedom is a good , if anything is . From this centre , the concept develops in different directions : we may consider some intention I might form , and ask whether I am free to carry it out , or whether anyone can bid me nay ; freedom here is being contrasted with prohibition . This is the sense in which a man who is not a slave is free : he does what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , however , is freedom contrasted not with verbal prohibition but with the pressure of factual circumstances . I can not act effectively if I am in great pain . We are not only rational agents but sentient beings , and as such are in various ways vulnerable . Some of these weaknesses , like susceptibility to pain , are almost conditions of sentience . Others , like susceptibility to hunger , or injury , are perhaps merely contingent conditions of human life as it actually is . But for any being who cares about what happens ? and therefore for any rational agent who might hope to achieve anything ? there must be some states of affairs that he wants to happen , and therefore some others that he does not want to happen , and which he will seek to prevent . Avoiding action always may have to be taken , and may conflict with acting in other desired ways . Therefore it is a general condition of being able to act as one desires that one is not having to take avoiding action , that one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we may regard Freedom as being chiefly // freedom from pressures , freedom from pain , from hunger , from ill health , from fear , from want , from arbitrary arrest , from public opinion . We may define a man as being free from some real or apprehended evil , if the evil neither happens , nor would happen nor would be likely to happen , were he not to take any otherwise superfluous avoiding action . There are many other senses of the word ' freedom ' . In mechanics we talk about degrees of freedom ; and in other sciences we talk of free energy , free radicals , free variables . Psychologists discuss freedom , and contrast it with the inner compulsions to which a man may be subject . Philosophers are much concerned with the freedom of the will . These are all legitimate and intelligible uses of the term and are natural extensions of the central sense . But I shall not discuss them , because they are not relevant to freedom in its political and legal senses , all of which turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , freedom to and freedom from . In all political and legal thought , the two aspects of Freedom are linked . They are linked in two ways . First , my actions may have consequences others wish to avoid ; so that my freedom to act as I wish may conflict with their freedom from suffering harm . Secondly , it is characteristic of legal rules , and of all political affairs , that they are hacked by sanctions ; the restraints enjoined by laws and ordinances must be observed if one is to be free from the pressure of constraints one would most certainly wish to avoid . At one level of crude calculation , the reason why I am not free to break the law is that if I do I shall not be free from those pains and penalties which are prescribed as punishments . And so we are tempted to argue conversely that to be free to do something means to be able to do it without fear of the consequences . But it does not follow , and , indeed , if we take consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to be free is to be able to act without consideration of consequences ; for then we should be free to act only in matters of indifference . This is the sense of the word in the phrase , ' You are free to choose as you please ' , when it is tantamount to flaying , ' I do not care what you do ' . But the freedom of indifference is not the freedom men have fought for . Therefore , although legal and political freedom to act are essentially linked to freedom from the pains and penalties of the law , the two must in our minds be kept distinct . Let us consider Freedom in the sense where it is contrasted with prohibition . A man is free to perform a particular action if he is not forbidden by an identifiable rule or person , that is authoritative ; if , // supposing he were to formulate his intention in words , I am going to do X ' , it would not conflict with any applicable rule or injunction , Nobody is to do X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am free to walk down the street , to sing the National Anthem in my bath , and , if my employer gives me permission , to leave the office early : I am not free to manufacture heroin , to move a pawn backwards , or , if my fiancee disapproves , to go to a dance with another girl . In each sentence we can replace the word free ' by the phrase at liberty ' . I am at liberty to walk down the street , etc . In the latter cases , however much I might want to do the deed in question , I could not , and could quote , as my reason for not being able to , a rule or person forbidding me . We contrast these cases , where I can not do what I want to do because of some prohibition , with other cases where my inability is due to some physical impossibility or lack of control of my circumstances . We sometimes dream of being as free as a bird . In the present century writers have sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South of France unless one is rich enough to afford it . These are intelligible uses of the word free ' , but somewhat strained . More naturally , we should wish that we were able to fly like a bird , and regret that we could not afford to go to France . In economic matters , the word free ' means either more than the sense presupposed by the protagonists of " economic freedom " , or less . If I was told I could go to the South of France free , I should expect to be able to go without paying ; that is , the normal prohibition on taking goods or accepting services , other than those one had paid for , was in abeyance . Thus we have free samples and free passes ; and with these , I should feel aggrieved if I was told that they were free because I was in a position to pay for them . On the other hand , when we talk of free trade , a free market , freedom of movement , freedom of employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goods are to be had without money , or that anybody is in a position to afford exactly what he wants : all we mean is that there are no prohibitions of a certain type , no customs duties , no immigration controls , no Control of Engagements Order . Economic freedom is not comparable with legal freedom or political freedom . It is comparable more with the metaphorical use of freedom when we speak of a mountaineer who had been wedged in a crevasse at last regaining his freedom . A man who is so poor that he never has any money at his disposal after the necessities of life have been bought is in the same sort of situation as the man unable to move at all . But the mountaineer , after having freed himself from his crevasse , can not legitimately // complain of his lack of freedom in being unable to scale a particular precipice ; nor should the man who can only afford to travel to Wembley t otnplain that he is not free to go to the South of France . His trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . Poverty can be an evil , and great poverty is a great evil : but it is a different evil from lack of freedom . SECTION 33 FREEDOM TO AND FREEDOM FROM F R E ED OM in the sense of freedom to do something , where we can do whatever it is that we want to do , without there being any authorita-tive rule or person to tell us not to , I shall call liberty , to distinguish it from freedom in the sense of freedom from some real or apprehended evil , which I shall call security or immunity . The words liberty ' , ' security ' , immunity ' , have often been used to mark off these different aspects of Freedom , but not always . The Liberties of the Middle Ages were often also Immunities for the reason that in them the two aspects of freedom were almost coincident . The mediaeval Liberties were liberties of communities to order their internal affairs themselves , and not at the behest of some feudal overlord , a bishop or a king : they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal affairs , though still under his general suzerainty . Liberty granted by an authority , freedom to do certain things , involves im-munity from that authority 's power , freedom from the authority 's punishing anybody who does those things . ' 1'lie mediaeval sense of liberty , although applied originally to communities , applies equally to individuals . An individual will be , vis-a-vis his ruler , if he is not subject to his arbitrary behests , and he can be sure that provided he does not contravene his ruler 's n-arbitrary prohibitions , he will not be punished by his ruler 's rcive power . The second condition is necessary , because it is the ntrol of coercive power that makes the ruler authoritative so far as e individual is concerned , and therefore if there is no freedom from nishment , there is no freedom to act independently of the ruler 's ? cific commands , and the subject is in the position of a slave . The inilnum condition of being a free man is a two-fold restriction , on // the ruler 's authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least practice , of imposing punishment . SECTION 34 FREEDOM UNDER THE LAW " ... laws wherein all men might see their duty beforehand , and know the penalties of transgressing them . " Richard Hooker , The Laws of Ecclesiastical Policy , Bk. 1 , Section to . THE two aspects of Freedom are combined in the notion of Freedom under the Law . The subject is free to do what the law permits him to do : and in doing what the law permits him to do and in not doing what the law forbids him to do he is free from the pressure of coercive sanctions . The law is authoritative and in a position to lay down what the subject is free to do and is not free to do , just because it controls coercive power and is able to secure freedom from coercion to those who abide by what it lays down . A legal system which is no longer enforceable is no longer authoritative , for it fails to secure to those who obey it freedom from coercion ; as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in force " , which means both that they are not enforced and that they are not authoritative . To this extent , Hobbes and Austin were right . The effective enforcement of a legal system is a necessary condition , and very largely also a sufficient condition , ' of its being authoritative : for only then will the liberties , the " freedoms to " , that it confers be effectively secured by immunities , " freedoms from " the fear of coercion . Historically , immunity from coercion was the first-felt need . For without that immunity , the orders of the ruler , however arbitrary , however unlawful , can not be resisted . And whether or not a ruler was actually prepared to enforce his unlawful orders by means of coercion , it would be a brave man who would dare disobey , unless he could be certain that he was entirely secure from the exercise of coercive power by a wrathful ruler . Immunities must be guaranteed , so that subjects can know for certain that they have nothing to fear from their sovereign 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displeasure that is dangerous , but only disobedience to the laws . It is for this reason that ' But see below , ? 73 , pp. 326-8. // the emphasis over the years has been on Process of Law rather than on limiting the scope of the supreme authority . Provided coercive power can be kept under proper control , we can discuss the limits of lawful authority : but if we are not free from the threat of coercion , we can not be fearless in criticising the conduct of the coercers , or in any of our doings . Therefore freedom from the fear of coercive sanctions for law-abiding citizens is the first freedom we must have if we are to be free at all . We must be careful not to over-state this requirement . It is freedom from coercion in the strict sense , that we need , not freedom from every pressure whatever . People often feel that freedom from coercion is not a real freedom unless it is also freedom from every fear or threat , every tie , and every compulsion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not be content with anything less than some ideal freedom , in which men will be absolutely free and unconstrained . Apart from the logical impropriety of extending the meanings of words llegitimately , such a demand is incoherent . For the only condition in which we could fear nothing would be that in which we valued nothing . To have values is to be vulnerable : to be absolutely free from all pressure is to be in a vacuum , in which events have no purchase on us , because we have no concern for events . ' Therefore we can not seriously want to be free from all pressure , much as we dislike being subject to some of the pressures that actually bear upon us . What we are concerned with here are those pressures that effectively incapacitate us from resistance ? that is , coercive pressures . Other pressures may seem to us to be overwhelming : we may feel compelled to alter a course of action by the threat of dismissal from our jobs : but these are not coercive pressures in the strict sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequence of losing one 's job ; and even if one is not prepared to accept the loss of one 's job , it is a sort of pressure different from the threat of death , torture or imprisonment . We may want to protect people from these lesser , but none the less effective , forms of pressure . It is a need that has been very much felt in recent years , especially with the growth of the administrative branch of govern-ment . But these lesser securities are different from the prime one , security from coercion , which is the first condition of the subject 's being a free man , able to make his own plans and lead his own life . Process of Law is effective in preventing the illegal use of coercion I5o FREEDOM UNDER THE LAW and in giving every law-abiding subject confidence in the face of the wielders of coercive power . You can not touch me , ' the citizen can say to the policeman , I have done nothing wrong . ' But Process of Law , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rule of Law , to ensure that authority is not abused . The citizen needs to have confidence not only in the face of the policeman , but in the face of the judge , and even in the face of the sovereign , if he is to be really free . He needs to be able to say to his judge or his sovereign , You can not punish me : I have done nothing wrong . ' Hence the first argument from Freedom to Legality . However good an equitable judge is , however fair and reasonable his decisions , he states his reasons ex post facto ; the subject can not argue with Judex I on a level footing , because he has no hold on him at all , nor with Judex II and Judex III , because he can never be sure that they will not pounce on some feature of his case to distinguish it from all the others , or think up some new reason for not treating it in the way he had expected . ' The principle of Equity gives the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject is to be free from fear of coercive sanctions , he needs to feel that the judge does not have the last word , logically speaking , for fear it be turned against him . Even though the equitable judge is entirely fair , and will not in fact discriminate against the sub-ject , the subject can not be sure of this beforehand : and therefore can not feel secure under the rule of Equity , but must demand Legality , so that the judge shall be as subject to the law as he is , and so that he can address him on a level footing and with confidence.2 Under Equity the subject may in fact be secure : but only under Legality can he feel absolutely secure . The principle of Legality confers on the subject security , so far as coercion is concerned , vis-a-vis his rulers . If we have the principle nulla poena sine lege , a subject can know what the law is , and that he has not contravened it , and that therefore the authorities can not get him , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although I may be in the authorities ' bad books , with or without good reason , I can still be sure that I shall not go to prison , provided only that I have not broken any law in the statute book . The law-abiding citizen need not fear the knock in the night : he knows that he can not be exiled to Siberia or slaughtered in Buchenwald . In granting to the subject an ever present security , the principle of // Legality grants also a liberty for the future . A man who knows what the law is , not only knows now that he is not liable to any legal penalty , but knows what he can subsequently do , without laying himself open to penalties , that is to say , what he may ( legally may ) do . He can plan his actions so as to keep within the law . Although , of course , he is not free to do anything he likes , he knows what it is that he is not free to do , and knows that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that the statutes do not forbid . The finitely formulated statutes lay upon him a limited legal unfreedom , but leave him legally free in all other , indefinitely many , respects . Legality means not only that the subject knows where he is , but that he also knows where he can go : he knows where he stands vis-a-vis the judge , and he knows how he can move with respect to the laws . Although they are restraints , they are limited and predictable ones . Legality assimilates the laws of the land to the laws of nature , which , although they prevent me from doing tome things , can be known and can be reckoned with , and can often also be used and manipulated . Legality makes it possible to know the law in advance , and to accommodate one 's actions to it : for Legality requires that laws be formulated in a finite number of general terms in advance of the event ; so that the subject can know what the laws are before he makes his plans , and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out to be a crime . Nullum crimen sine lege . This is the second argument from Freedom to Legality . The combination of immunity from coercion for the law-abiding bject with liberty to do anything that has not been prohibited by a w , we may call Constitutional Freedom , or Freedom under the Law . t is the first and most basic form of Freedom . It defines the Freedom of the subject vis-a-vis his ruler , not vis-a-vis his fellow subjects . It concerns the liberty of the subject , and his security against the arbitrary of the power of coercion , as seen from the subject 's point f view . We want the subject not only to be free , but to know that he is e , so that he may act as a rational autonomous agent in full con:iousness of his freedom . Hence , quite apart from the danger of error or abuse on the part of the ruler , we have the need for Legality in order to secure to the subject chartered freedoms . We crudify our ideal of complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by limiting in advance the factors that may be counted as relevant . Justice becomes rougher , but easier to reckon with ; less exact , but less cting ; less perfect , but safer for imperfect men to live with . The ws remain , but under them we are free . // SECTION 35 LEGALITY : THE EXTERNAL ASPECT " The certainty of laws involves an obscuring of reason , in so far as in them reason is supported merely by authority . And this makes us experience the laws as hard to obey , and yet we are constrained to obey them because of their being certain " . Vico , Sciena Nuova Seconda ( 1744 ) , I , ii , Ch . CXI . THE arguments from Constitutional Freedom to Legality are both arguments of imperfection , the imperfection of the ruled . We argue for Legality because we are imperfect , finite , fallible , selfish creatures . Its very demerit is its merit . It fails to do justice to the complexity of some hard cases because of its finitude . A law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specify only a finite number of characteristics as relevant to a case . This means that with some cases the law will enjoin a decision not in accordance with the merits of the case , because it takes into consideration only some and not all of the features of the particular case in question , which we should regard as relevant . But it also means that a finite human being , with only finite capacities and only finite time available for study of the law , can discover what the law is , what are the features of a case that are relevant in the eyes of the law , and what will be the legal consequences of his acts . Even if judges were perfectly just , and gave decisions that were entirely equitable , those concerned with the law from the outside would still not be content . For they want to know what the law is in advance , so that they can avoid breaking it inadvertently , and avoid being punished . If men were perfectly informed and infallible in their judgement , they might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every case ; but they would not then be men . It certainly is so , that men are neither perfectly informed nor free from error in their reasonings , and perhaps it is necessarily so , that there should be some matters of indifference if different beings are to inhabit a common world . At the very least we need to have conventions on issues in themselves indifferent , where it does not matter what we do , so long as we all do the same thing ; for example , the Rule of the Road . But even on issues not completely indifferent , ? the enforceability of contracts , the law of Landlord and Tenant ? it matters less to the subject what decisions would be given than that he should know what decisions // will be given . For if he knows , he can plan accordingly , while if he does not know , he can not arrange his actions rationally so as to secure the goals he has set himself . If the laws of the land which will be enforceable by the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take them into account in his calculations in the same way as he can take laws of nature into account . Forgery and phosgene are both to be avoided by the man who values his liberty or his life . It is a condition of the subject 's freedom and independence that the laws of the land shall be certain and knowable in advance . And therefore the subjects ill want their judges to be as like as possible Judex IV . Men can fail not only in their knowledge of what is right , but in their will to do it . Men are incompletely unselfish , ' and often want to Dchieve their own ends , irrespective of whether they are right or not ; Iutd it is , as we shall see , 2 a mark of a free community that we do not stematically set out to prevent men from forming and carrying ut all plans that are at variance with what we believe to be right . dividuals , we believe , ought to be permitted to exercise their own , ovate , judgement about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legal restrictions . They ought to be able not only to know e law , in order to avoid inadvertently contravening it , but to cal-late on it , and even to some extent against it , and to avail themselves Df it , and even to manipulate it for their own purposes . 1 Iuman limitations thus lead us to trade Justice for certainty . Durum d ita scriptum est , but it is only because the law is hard and rigid at we know where we are with it , and can avoid it and use it and ly on it , in the same external way as a law of nature . We therefore erse the quantifiers , and set up Legality , with the strong require-nt of Universalisability , in the place of Equity with its weak require-nt . It means that Justice becomes less rational but more knowable , s moral but more dependable , less internal but less restricting . slice ceases to be something which , if only we were better informed d were possessed of a sounder judgement , we could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can accept a mpetent lawyer 's advice with confidence . Justice will sometimes be just : but will be less often censorious . One will feel less pressure to dorse the verdict or the sentence of a court of justice as one 's own : t equally the court will enquire less into one 's own inward motives attitude of mind , and there will be a veil of privacy between the ge and oneself , behind which one will be able to think one 's own // self-interested thoughts , and come to know oneself as the selfish but genuine self that one is . The goddess of Justice is often represented as blindfolded , weighing the arguments in her scales . The figure can be taken in two ways : it can be taken , and was perhaps originally intended to be taken , as an ideal of Equity : the eyes are blindfolded so as not to see irrelevant features , corrupt considerations of fear or favour ; Justice , like God , is no respecter of persons , and will give her decision solely on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the persons , but only weighs the arguments . But equally we may regard the goddess as representing Legality , into whose scales may be put only those factors deemed relevant by law . The dispenser of Justice does not allow herself to look beyond the text of the law , and only takes into consideration what the law lays down . Not only does she not consider the persons of the litigants , she does not consider their personalities , their attitudes , their moral merits or their real deserts . Justice is morally blind as well as uncorrupt and impartial , and a man can approach the courts as he can an automatic vending machine with the assurance that it will dispense justice without regard to any personal defects or weaknesses of his , or of any other factor whatever , save only those laid down by law beforehand . The uncouth , the eccentric and the selfish can approach Legality as well as the respectful , the respectable and the righteous , and can , provided only they tender the coin demanded by statute in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Legality is the bad man 's charter . These arguments from the external point of view , like those from the internal point of view , have force but do not lead inescapably to absolute Legality . They are all arguments from imperfection , and imperfect though we are , we are not that imperfect . Even the demand for predictability and manipulability can be pitched too high . While we want to avoid uncertainty , we do not need , nor can we hope to have , absolute certainty about every question , in law any more than in nature . It is enough to know that the sun will rise tomorrow : we do not need to know , nor can hope to know , that it will certainly not rain . Similarly it is enough to know that provided I commit no murder or treason I shall not be hanged , and that if I make a straightforward contract it will in the ordinary course of events be enforceable at law . If a man sails close to the windy side of the law and gets unexpectedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is held to be unenforceable , it may be a good , or it may be a bad , thing ; but it does // not destroy the knowability or the reasonable certainty that the law must have for the ordinary man of good faith , if he is to order his affairs freely and rationally . SECTION 36 LEGAL LIBERTY IT I s clear that there is more to the notion of Freedom than the Constitutional Freedom secured by the Rule of Law . I may live under a system of laws which are entirely general , and be secure from any arbitrary exercise of power on the part of the rulers ; but still be hemmed in and restricted in all my doings , seldom able to do what I want , nearly always obliged to act in a way laid down by law . Although , in one sense , law is the guarantee of liberty , in another , it is the negation of liberty . Cicero says " Legum idcirco omnes servi sumus ut liberi isse possimus " : 1 but Salmond says , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within which the law is content to leave me alone " ; 2 and both seem to be right . We therefore need to go beyond the Rule of Law in the sense of Constitutional Freedom , Freedom under the Law , and consider the problem of Liberty within the Law . We consider first the definition of a formal concept of legal liberty , in order that we may then discuss what the laws of a free country must be like . Our concept of liberty or freedom to is defined by contrast . We are free to do X when we are not forbidden to do it , either by an identi-fiable rule or by an identifiable person , regarded by us as authoritative . Similarly we are free not to do X when there is no authoritative rule or person forbidding us not to do X , i.e. commanding us to do X. If we are living in a community , for every X that I might want to do , somebody else might want me not to do it . For the community to be a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to do X or not allowing me to do X. If I am allowed to do X we may say that I am legally free to do X : if I am not allowed to do X , we may say that I am under a legal obligation ( or , that I have // a legal duty ) not to do X. From the point of view of the other person who objects , or might object , my legal obligation will be viewed as his legal right . If I am under an obligation not to do X , then he can be said to have a right that I should not do X. This terminology , which is due to Hohfeld , l is illuminating , in that it shows how rights and duties are merely different aspects of the same legal relationship . We should be cautious , however , in that the word right ' is used in many other ways , which can easily cause confusion ; in particular , right ' often means liberty ' , for reasons which will shortly become apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable . We have , as it were , a Square of Obligation , which enables us to describe both outcomes of a dispute from both points of view . Suppose there is a dispute about a particular action X , which has been done , or is about to be done , by a particular man A , to which another man , B , objects . The decision procedure of the community is invoked ; that is , the two parties go to court . The court will give its decision , based on certain general characteristics of the action X , the man A and the man B. The court will either decide in favour of A 's doing X or against , and it can be looked at from A 's point of view or from B 's . We now classify : Hohfeld coined the word no-right ' to fill the space in the left-hand column of the bottom row ; and he uses the words Privilege ' and Liberty ' as alternatives for the left-hand column of the top row . The left-hand column is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The top row is equivalent to the bottom row , and vice versa . In order to bring out the equivalence , we need to include in the // statement from A 's point of view to whom he does or does not owe a duty . Let us , therefore , retabulate : This is Hohfeld 's analysis , ' on the basis of which we can build up a definition of formal freedom . It is not enough for the decision procedure of a community to produce decisions . It must produce decisions which are effective . If A wishes to do X and B wishes that A should not do X , and the dispute is referred to a court which decides in favour of A , then it is not enough for the court merely not to forbid A from doing X ; it must also forbid B from trying to coerce A , having failed to get a court order against him . Otherwise , the decision procedure has decided nothing . If it is to be a substitute for the appeal to force , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but some subsidiary ones as well . Thus if the court decides that I am at liberty to do X , despite your objection , it must also lay upon you the duty of not preventing me by force from doing X. Else , it has not substituted its own decision for the arbitra-ment of force . If for example , the court decided that I was at liberty to do X , but failed to rule against your using force to stop me , there would be the further question whether I might use force to prevent your attempt to stop me doing X from being successful . If the court says that I may in my turn use force , then it has abdicated its position as an arbiter between disputants , and it would be a waste of time for us to go to court , and we shall have simply to fight it out , literally , between // ourselves . If , on the other hand , the court says No , and lays it down that you are allowed to stop me by force from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force to prevent you from stopping me , then this is what we describe as my not being at liberty to do X , but being under a duty towards you that I should not do X. Hence it is , that for every liberty possessed by one person there must be laid upon the other party a set of subsidiary duties not to use force to prevent the one person from exercising his liberty . That is , looking at it entirely from the one person 's point of view , each of his liberties needs to be supplemented by a set of subsidiary rights ( in Hohfeld 's sense ) against would-be interferers that they should not interfere . ' My liberty to walk down the road would be vain if it were not supported by a Hohfeldian right against any man who would stop me . This is why in common parlance the word right ' is used indiscriminately of Hohfeldian rights and Hohfeldian liberties . There are certain exceptions to the concomitance of Hohfeldian rights and Hohfeldian liberties : in a boxing ring for example , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as it is above the belt ) , but have no right that the other should not prevent them by force . Under international law a neutral is at liberty to ship contraband to a belligerent . Other belligerents have no-right that he should refrain , but they too are at liberty to seize the contraband . The neutral is at liberty to run when sighted , but if he disobeys a signal to heave to , the belligerent is at liberty to sink him . Both these exceptions are peculiar : they stand half-way between a normal system of laws which decide every case , and the law of the jungle , which is no law at all , and in which every conflict is settled by force . Some things are not allowed in boxing or international law : hitting below the belt , or sinking a stationary neutral ship . But most issues are not decided by the rules : he who can , may . With such , defective , incomplete systems we are not concerned : their only interest is as illustrating , by contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision , other than by resort to force , for every issue that arises . Every normal and complete legal system therefore must support the liberties it confers with ancillary rights . If I am to be free , so far as you are concerned , to do X , then I must also have some right of your not preventing me by force from doing X. The limitations implicit in the italicised words are important . I may well be entitled to do X while you are entitled to prevent me from doing X if I attempt to do so in LEGAL LIBERTY 1S9 an unreasonable or unseemly manner : and although you may be forbidden from using force ' to prevent me from doing X , you may well be entitled to use some sanctions to prevent me . An uncle may threaten to cut his nephew out of his will if he becomes a bookie : a girl may " force " her fiance to give up his motor-bike2 : but though these are restrictions on freedom in one sense ? an important one to the man concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal freedom . So far as legal liberty goes ? freedom in the formal sense we are concerned with here ? the man is free to become a bookmaker , is free to keep his motor-bike ; and neither his uncle nor his fiancee is free to stop him absolutely , though they are free to do some things which may well in fact deter or prevent him . If he really wants to , the young man can become a bookie or keep his motor-bike , and accept the consequences of ' his uncle changing his will or his fiancee breaking off the engagement . He is free so to act ? there is no law against it ? and they are free to carry out their threats ? there is no law against that either : whereas he is not free to forge his uncle 's signature , or hit his fiancee ; and his uncle is not free to have him put in prison to prevent him being u bookmaker , and his fiancee is not free to sell or destroy his motorbike in order to prevent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legal system , even a normal and complete legal system , does not guarantee that a man will be free to exercise them without anybody bidding him nay , and without his being subject to any pressure not to do what he is entitled to do . All that is required is that the system of rights and liberties is so arranged that the parties never have to resolve their disputes by force or violence or the threat of violence . So far we have spoken always of duties or liberties or rights , of one man with respect to another . This is because there are necessarily two parties to a dispute , and it is only with reference to actual or hypothetical resolutions of a dispute that the concepts of duty , liberty , and right originated . Nevertheless we tend to think of duties , liberties , and rights as very often falling upon , or belonging to , only one man . My freedom to go upon the Queen 's highway is not a freedom with respect to you particularly : it is a freedom with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " the world at large " . In such cases there is no point in specifying the large , indefinite class with respect to whom I have some liberty or right . We just say that I have the 16o PRIVILEGE AND ACCOUNTABLE DISCRETION liberty or right in question ; if pressed , we should say , at a first ap-proximation , that I have it with respect to everybody else ; and only if pressed further will consider whether there are any exceptions ? e.g. policemen ? to the rule that nobody is to prevent me going as I please along the highway . With duties we are more ready to ask the question , To whom is the duty owed ? ' But often , even with duties , it is a little unnatural to attach them , as owed , to any particular person ; they are owed , if owed to anybody at all , to everybody . The duties laid upon the subject by the criminal law , or by taxation law , are not felt as duties to anyone , not even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the Queen , in whose name also the case is decided . We need to walk warily , therefore , when we claim that duties , rights , and liberties always concern not one person but two : for the second one may be difficult to identify , difficult to specify exactly , and sometimes may not be an individual at all . Never-theless , there always are two parties to a dispute : and if nobody existed , neither private individual nor public official , who could object to one 's doing an action X , no question of whether one was legally free to or not could ever arise . SECTION 37 PRIVILEGE AND ACCOUNTABLE DISCRETION WITHIN the Hohfeldian concept of legal liberty , an important distinction must be drawn between those liberties which arise from the accountable discretion entrusted to an official ' and those which are absolute and are not in any way a trust . The discretion granted to an official is accountable . He has authority to decide certain questions , but he is responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an answer to the question , Why did you do that ? ' and be able to give reasons why a person entrusted with his office should have acted in the way he did . In contrast to this , the person in whom a privilege is vested is not answerable for his actions in any legal or constitutional way.2 He does not have to give reasons nor does he have to have them . He may act // on whim , he may act out of inclination , he may act in pursuit of self-interest , and , legally , he is quite entitled so to do . A man exercising a privilege is entitled to say , I just wanted to ' , if challenged to explain his actions : an official exercising a discretion entrusted to him is not . Whatever an official decides to do , he must be able to describe it as being what seemed best to him from the standpoint of the trust , not merely as what he happened to want to do . We therefore distinguish within the Hohfeldian concept of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an official capacity , where his decision is , one way or another , open to some sort of legal or constitutional criticism , from the absolute discretion , which I call a privilege , and which more closely corresponds to our everyday concept of liberty within the law , where we are not required to give any reasons for our actions , and the simple fact that we want so to act is sufficient legal justification for our doing so . The ways in which an official may be required to give an account of his exercise of his discretion are many and various . But there are always , as we have seen , ' certain minimum conditions which we demand in any account of the exercise of discretion . These minimum conditions provide us with criteria for distinguishing the responsible exercise of accountable discretion in an official capacity from the exercise of an absolute privilege or liberty . There is no objection to my exercising an absolute privilege or liberty arbitrarily or unreasonably , in return for some financial reward , or from fear or for favour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise official discretion for these reasons . Financial reward , because it is the most definite , is the most useful criterion . There is no objection to my conveying my house , or a car , or a washing machine , to another man in return for money , or to working for him for a wage , or giving him my advice for a fee : but it is a criminal offence to vote for a man in a parliamentary or local election in return for money ? which shows that we do regard the vote as a trust rather than a right . For this reason also we regard it as regrettable , although there can not be a law against it , that some electors cast their votes arbitrarily and vote for the first name that appears on the ballot paper . Similarly we seek to protect voters from Intimidation , and look with some disfavour upon nepotism in mini-sterial appointments . We do not have similar views ? unless we are unduly censorious ? about " investors " giving their money to the pools , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose property he has damaged by offering to make good the damage himself in his own time , or about an aunt bequeathing her house to her nephew . An advowson in the Church of England ? the right to appoint the parson of a particular parish ? is thus not property , in our sense , because there is the offence of simony ? appointing a man who has paid to be appointed . Civil Service Commissioners , Degree Examiners , Electors to Scholarships , and innumerable other public and private officials have wide discretion over whom they elect or appoint , but commit an offence if they do so for money : and are sworn not to do so arbitrarily or for fear or for favour . Not so a private employer . We thus have a useful test of whether a Hohfeldian liberty is an accountable discretion or absolute privilege , in whether it is logically possible to exercise it corruptly or not . It always makes sense to speak of an official acting corruptly , just as it always makes sense ( even though there may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abusing his authority : , whereas it makes no sense to speak of a privilege being exercised corruptly , because the concept of a privilege is such that the concept of its being corruptly exercised can not apply . This , however , is only a criterion : the essential characteristic of a privilege is that the holder is not , legally or constitutionally , answerable for his exercise of it . A legal privilege is a Hohfeldian legal liberty to act , combined with a further Hohfeldian legal liberty not to give or have any good reasons for one 's act . It is the right to act irresponsibly . SECTION 3s IN DEFENCE OF PRIVILEGE IT I s often felt that it would be better if there were no private privileges but only public offices ; that is , instead of assigning to private persons various legal privileges , in the Hohfeldian sense , according to which they are entitled to do various things merely because they happen to want to , they should be granted only public offices , which would confer on them all needful discretion but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion . This would leave them free to do all things reasonable , but would eliminate the irrationality and selfishness that disfigures our national life . It is largely through the // rational and disinterested discharge of official duties that rationality enters into the life of the community , and if all actions were done in the course of official duty , we should make the life of the community rationally transparent , instead of , as at present , rationally opaque . Moreover , many people would prefer it that way . It would make their life much more significant if it was wholly lived under the aegis of public policy rationally conceived and rationally executed . It would provide them with a rationale for existing and a purpose in life , which are lacking if their raison d'etre is merely themselves , and their object in life is merely to enjoy themselves . And so we demand the abolition of the self , and the consecration of every individual life into a facet of the communal whole , to be lived as part of a public trust . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it is im-practicable , it is inefficient , and it is undesirable . It is impracticable because men are selfish . We can control the old Adam in us , especially if we can divert him : but we can not suppress or abolish him . If we have relatively few offices and trusts , we can require that people , while holding them , shall discharge them unselfishly . For we can be selective in our choice of office-holders , and the office-holders themselves have time in which to lead their private lives , and let off their accumulated head of self-interested steam . If we screw down these safety valves , men will not become totally unselfish . They will continue , on occasion , to serve their private interests as before , but will do so under cover of discharging their official duties . They may even conceal their motives from themselves , and be all the more zealous in increasing their power or enlarging their empire , because they are convinced that they are doing whatever they are doing for the purest love of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interacting in a common world and having some values in common , without each agent being imbued with some nisus towards egocentricity , it is best to license it and legitimise self-interest , in order to distinguish from it , on occasions of need , real disinterestedness . If we legitimise self-interest , it will come Into the open , and can be recognised for what it is , and can be con-trolled : if we attempt to suppress it , it will run underground , often unknown and always unchecked . The inefficiency of officialdom was borne in on the public by the various experiments in nationalisation and State-control in the years ' ter the war . There are two causes . First , if I am accountable , I must ep accounts . The private trader can take decisions and forget the sons wh : the official must take care to formulate his reasons and // file them , in case there is a parliamentary question , or a query from the board of directors . The bureaucrat therefore must spend much time in unproductive justification in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private trader is getting on with his job . In some cases the loss of " productivity " is justified . The time spent by judges in delivering their judgements is well spent , because first it gives guidance to other potential litigants for the future , and makes the law more predictable and more serviceable to the subjects ; and secondly it is of paramount importance not only to prevent judges from abusing their powers but to make it reasonably certain that they can not . Similarly with public officials who wield great power or who control large sums of public money , the danger of abuse is so great that it is worth accepting greater inefficiency or greater cost in order to have safeguards against abuse . But the argument does not carry over to all our transactions . Trustees and executors waste a lot of time that the beneficial owner is saved . Accountability is a drag not only on the rapidity of business but on its enterprise . The conscientious official or trustee will not take risks on another 's behalf that he would be prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek a refuge in inaction , since if a risky enterprise fails he will have to justify having embarked on it , while if it succeeds he will not receive much credit . In either case , there is a premium on safety ? which is only to be expected since answerability was first devised as a safeguard . But too much safety is dangerous . A community in which nobody is prepared to take risks or make innovations is likely to perish of inanition . The fundamental reason why accountability is a drag upon enterprise is that human beings are infinitely complex , but human communications are of only finite capacity . In giving my reasons for deciding one way rather than another in human affairs , I can articulate my arguments only to a finite length and a finite degree of complexity ; and often there will be much more I could have said , if only I had had wit enough and time enough to say it . If I am to answer for my decisions , I will make a decision according to the answers I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really think is the best . This is not to say that what I really think to be the best is not rational . It may well be rational ( though of course it may not be ) : I may have weighed the arguments and have reasoned with myself to the best of my abilit , , and find myself inclined , by reason , one way , but be unable to state all my reasons , to articulate all the arguments . It is one thing to think , IN DEFENCE OF PRIVILEGE . 165 another to be able to formulate one 's thoughts in words . The latter is a valuable skill , possessed by judges , civil servants , novelists , and dons ; but although connected with the ability to reason through to the right conclusion , is not the same as it . Many people can think but can not express their thoughts at all well : and , on the other hand , there are some people ? including some academics ? whose judgement is invariably faulty , but who can formulate their fallacies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes judgements which are felt as well as those which are formulated : Pascal 's isprit de finesse as well as his isprit de giometrie . The word reasons ' naturally applies only to the latter . It often so happens that a man is acting in accordance with reason , but is unable to state in words what his reasons are. , If that man is strictly accountable for his actions , with little or no dis-cretion or latitude allowed him , he will have to decide not in accordance with reason but in accordance with such reasons as he finds himself able to formulate . This is , of course , a safeguard against errors , and especially gross errors , of judgement , but it is often also a barrier against his following reason all the way ; particularly so when it comes to assessing persons . The reasons we can give why we trust or distrust a certain man often seem unconvincing when put down in black and white : yet it is not the reasons given , but the actual results , which are important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances to one man rather than to another , but if in the event the first is unable to repay while the latter proves himself a reliable client , the banker may be able to exculpate himself , but can not recover the money . Similarly in selecting a man for an academic post , similarly in in-numerable other transactions , the arguments that can be adduced in incontrovertible form are far less important than assessments of personality . But assessments of personality not only are perilously Subject to prejudice and bias , but merge into that very " favour " that officials are sworn to eschew . The banker is right to trust his boyhood friend ; in innumerable different situations he has observed him and discovered him to be trustworthy and competent : but if the bank manager gives overdrafts to his friends in preference to others , it surely will smack of favouritism and " the old boy net " . A scholar is right to back his pupil for an appointment . He has had opportunity to note his fertility of mind , his intellectual integrity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and talents to proper use . But // academic appointments should be made , we feel , on an impartial assessment of merit , not on a basis of personal contacts and likes and dislikes . The favour of a partly rational being , although suspect , is not wholly bad , and is often the best indication we have of merit . If we allow decisions to be made on personal grounds , they will be suspect : if we take care to exclude all suspicion of favour , we often will have deprived ourselves of the only useful guidance we could have had . The goddess of justice , we recall , weighs the scales with her eyes blindfolded . This , we have seen , can be taken in different ways . But , however it is taken , and whatever the arguments for having justice blindfolded , it clearly makes for inefficiency to have all decisions made without benefit of sight . We have finally the fact that we do not want to live all our lives as officials . Some people like to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we regard this as a regrettable desire , characteristic of Kulaks or Middle Western Republican businessmen , fairly strong arguments would need to be found before we were justified in denying to these people the right to live non-official lives . And even men who find fulfilment in officialdom , even the most dedicated civil servants , like to have some private life as well . Nor is this merely a liking that men happen to have , like our liking for strawberries . It is part of our respect for human beings as such , that we are prepared to accept the simple fact that a human being wants something to be the case as a good reason for its being so . We can not of course let everybody have his own way about everything : but if we refuse ever to allow a personal predilection any weight , unless it is backed by an impersonal rational argument , we are not allowing anything to personality as such . It may be rational , but it is less than human . I show my rationality in subjecting my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my humanity in subjecting my own will to the will of another whom I love , or respect , or pity , even though it is unreasonable . The humility of humanity is greater than that of rationality ; more essential to the happy life , more easily overlooked by political theorists . Human beings often are awkward , often do want silly things , often ought to want things which they do not . It is tempting to disregard their unreasonable wants when thinking about what laws to lay down for them : but to disregard what they actually want is to be no longer laying down laws for them , but to be seeking , in a roundabout way , to impose our own wills on them : an ancient temptation and a natural one , but not a laudable one ; and one that is open to a devastating to quoque from the would-be wilful subject . // Personality , as we have already seen , is too complex to be con-formed to the canons of rationality . Faced with the infinite complexity of personality , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept it . We must let other people be themselves : we must have courage ourselves to be ourselves . By this I do not mean that we should never make reasonable demands of other people or of ourselves , and that if a person claims to find self-fulfilment in murdering his friends , we ought to let him do so . I mean , rather , that even when all the rational demands we can formulate have been met , there remains some-thing more . We may reasonably demand of a writer that he should observe all the rules of grammar and syntax : but his style is something more than his observance of all these rules . So in a man 's life , there are many rules he ought to observe , and many further particular points where the right answer is reasonably clear : but there is much more in his life than all this , which is not determined simply by conformity to rules or to reason , but which bears the imprint of , or even , according to some authorities , constitutes , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concession to human weakness ? though often it is chiefly this ? but also as being the highest and best and most valuable we can aspire to . And therefore , both as an exercise in human humility , and as a consequence of a proper pride in humanity , we want to give human personality full rein , and room in which to develop . And therefore the good community is not an official community , but a free one , in which I want to ' is always a good , often a sufficient , although never a conclusive , reason for allowing a man to act in the way which he desires. , SECTION 39 FREEDOM AND PATTERNS OF LIFE WE HAVE now given a formal account of legal Freedom or Liberty . We have shown that it concerns two parties , and that in any normal and complete legal system , liberty for one party needs to be supple-mented by some duty on the other party not to interfere by force . Liberty for the one involves restriction for the other , so that there can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather , every // solution must be a balance both between freedoms and restrictions , and between liberties and securities . In the formal , legal , sense of freedom , every freedom is correlative with an unfreedom : there is no question of one system offering more freedom than another , but only of its allocating freedoms better . England is a free country because the police are less , not more , free than they are abroad ; because other people are less , not more , free to strike me , to enter my house uninvited , to have their views unquestioned by me , to have their wares not undersold by mine . That is , we attach more importance to being able to do some things than others ; to being able to go where we will in public than to freedom from crowds , and to being able to enjoy privacy at home than to being able to gratify our curiosity about our neighbours ' doings . Our notion of freedom , therefore , is tied to an idea of human nature , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do . We are often faced with conflicting wants , and have to adjudicate between them , giving one sort of freedom rather than another . Women very often want to choose for themselves to whom they shall give themselves in marriage : parents very often want to ensure that their daughters are married wisely and well . In giving the final say to the bride , provided she is over twenty-one , rather than to the bride 's parents , we are spelling out one particular view of human nature rather than another . In this case it might seem obvious to a modern man which way the decision ought to go : but in other cases the decision will go the other way ; the right of a man to go whithersoever he will is overridden by the right of a man to privacy in his own house . If I want to go into your house and you do not want me to go into it , it is your want , that I should not do something , rather than my want , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage , although English law preserves the freedom of the bride , at whatever cost in anguish to her parents or to other suitors , to marry whomsoever she wants , it does not guard so jealously the right of remarriage . The children of a first marriage and the relatives of the dead husband are thought to have more legitimate grounds for objecting to a widow 's remarriage than the parents of an adult woman , although not conclusive ones . In this again we are spelling out a certain concept of marriage , and the commitments and loyalties involved . A more difficult case is that of noise . For many people , particularly the young , freedom is taken to be freedom to make whatever noise one likes : for many others , particularly the elderly , freedom is freedom // to be able to hear oneself think . It would be tempting to assign to each individual a sphere in which he could be as noisy as he liked provided no noise penetrated into the spheres of those who wanted to be quiet . But such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely impracticable . Men do not live in spheres . Men are perpetually interacting with one another . They can not help but do so , nor would they wish it otherwise . Therefore we can not solve the problem of noise by insulating men from one another in cells . Rather , we consider what is reasonable for a man to do and to expect others to do . It is reasonable for a man to talk ; for children to laugh and shout as they come out of school ; for fire engines and ambulances to use alarm bells and sirens ; for everybody to sleep at night . It is not reasonable to use a loudspeaker out of doors , except in special circumstances ; or to use a pneumatic drill as a musical instrument ; or to " rev " a motor-bike continuously ; or to make any loud and prolonged noise at night . Instead of assigning spheres , we consider patterns of life : life lived by people who are not deaf , who want to sleep at nights , who want to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes call to their children with a shout , often walk along the streets , sometimes come roistering home late at night , let off fireworks on the Fifth of November , and are summoned to church by the sound of bells . Since the Industrial Revolution , which has made many of the activities in which men may reasonably engage much more noisy than before , and much more noisy than other men may reasonably be expected to bear , the conflict of interests has become much more difficult to adjudicate . The freedom of one man in a railway carriage to hear his favourite wireless programme on his transistor set is irreconcilably opposed to the freedom of another to talk to his neighbour or to read his paper in peace . Men do want to travel fast and use jet aircraft to do so ; and these are reasonable wants : but so too are the desires of other Men living in houses near aerodromes not to have their sleep disturbed or their nerves frayed by continual ear-piercing roars . We can not claim that Freedom requires us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which nobody was able to use jet-aircraft would not be naturally described as more or less free than one in which some were unable to sleep . The issue is not one of Freedom , but of different wants and interests , both reasonable but not both compatible ; and the way in which a State resolves such a conflict shows not how great is its love of liberty , but which wants it cherishes most , and which pattern of life it regards as pre-eminently its own . // The pattern of life that a society cherishes changes over the years . It changes partly as a result of a reassessment of the general scale of values , partly under the impact of new scientific and technical discoveries . The ideal of romantic love rates much higher in the modern world than it did in ancient times , and is now set above the ideal of stable family life . The germ theory of disease gives strong grounds for curtailing the liberty of a man suffering from a dangerous infection . Even within the confines of his own home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he likes , if this involves interfering with his neighbours ' television . Modern man is free to do many things his ancestors could not do ; but is subject to restrictions they never dreamed of . SECTION 40 THE SUBSTANTIAL CONCEPT OF LIBERTY THUS far it might seem that Freedom was a purely formal concept . Every politico-legal system has its liberties and obligations , its privileges and restrictions , its rights and duties ; and if we increase freedom at one place we necessarily diminish it at others . But although this is true , we nevertheless regard some systems as more free than others : some formal freedoms are more important than others . And although in marginal cases , the ideal pattern of life in a society will determine which freedom is more important , it is not simply a conflict between different patterns of life ; for among different patterns of life we can pick out some that are more concerned with freedom than others . The purely formal characterisation of freedom is not enough : nor is it sufficient merely to refer to patterns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our idea of freedom . We must therefore give content to our idea of Freedom first by contrasting with it certain other political ideals we may have , and secondly by analysing more closely the connexion between freedom and action in a pattern of life . A free society can be contrasted with an orderly one , a just one , an equal one , an efficient one , a united one , a rigid one , a secure one . These ideals can not all be achieved at once , and we inevitably have to compromise . The extent to which we sacrifice other ideals to that of Freedom indicates how far our society is a free one . Thus in the administration of justice , we sacrifice Effectiveness to Freedom in insisting that a suspect must be cautioned on arrest and brought before // a magistrate within twenty-four hours ; or , in civil cases , in requiring writs to be served personally , and in taking no effective steps to prevent defaulting debtors from " disappearing " . More generally , we hamper the efficiency of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property . This can be viewed as a sacrifice of Efficiency to Freedom , though it can also be viewed as a sacrifice of Efficiency to Legality . Similarly for the sake of Freedom , we sacrifice fairness , as when we allow a man to cut his children out of his will and leave his property to his secretary ; or Justice , as when we allow a guilty man to escape on a technical point of law ; or Equality , as when we allow a man to make himself rich without sharing his riches round the rest of his fellow men ; or Uniformity , as when we allow Roman Catholics to stay away from services in church ; or Security , as when we allow women to buy what hats they please , and thereby expose milliners to the risk of penury if fashion goes against them . On each of these issues we could have drawn the line between what is and what is not permitted differently . A free society is one where in order to have men acting according to their own wishes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is always a compromise : it is always a matter of more or k 's . Absolute Freedom , like Absolute Justice , Absolute Equality , Absolute Uniformity , is an ideal impossible of attainment . In deciding between my wanting to do Xand your wanting me not to do X , a large number of considerations may be adduced . We intuitively equate freedom with my being able to do X ; but as we have seen , in any complete system , to give one man freedom to do X involves denying other men freedom to stop him from doing X. We therefore can not simply equate freedom with an absence of legal restriction . Nevertheless our intuitive sense is a good guide : the distinction ordinary language makes between doing X and stopping another man from doing X , although difficult to formulate , is often easy to apply . And then a love of Freedom will incline us to safeguard a man 's right to do X rather than another man 's right to stop him doing X. More precisely , if a man 's action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then in a free system , he will be entitled to do that action , and other men will not be entitled to stop him , unless there are good reasons otherwise . That is , the onus , in a free system , is on those who would stop a man from doing something , to show why he should not be allowed to , rather than on him to show why he should be allowed to . Moreover , in a free society , a strong case has to be established before we will say that a man ought not to be allowed to do the action in question . The difficulty is to give the correct description of a particular action on a particular occasion . Our concept of action is elusive , and depends as much on what the agent would have done if circumstances had been different as on the bodily movements that actually occurred . Many legal disputes are about the correct descriptions of particular actions , and call into consideration the context of action and the standards of behaviour current in society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider only those cases in which there is accepted a description of the action in terms of an intransitive verb , or a transitive one which does not have a person as its direct or indirect object ; descriptions such as I was walking ' , but not such as I was hitting him ' or I was throwing a stone at him ' . For such an action there is in a free society a prima facie case for the agent 's being entitled to do it : but this prima facie case can sometimes be defeated , and we have to discuss what considerations will defeat it . SECTION 41 LIBERTY AND HARM THE intuitively most obvious reason why a person should not be allowed to do a certain action is that the action would cause or would constitute a harm to some other person ; since we are considering actions described in a somewhat minimal way , it will be the consequences of the action thus described , rather than the action itself , that will be harmful . To be harmful , a thing must be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that they are right not to want . It is part of our common set of values , which we are prepared to affirm , irrespective of what any particular person wants or claims to want . The paradigm cases are death , bodily injury , and imprisonment . Most people not merely want to avoid these evils , but are convinced that they are evil , and will not be persuaded otherwise . No matter how much a man protests that so far as he is concerned he does not mind whether he is killed , mutilated , or incarcerated , we do not take him seriously , and we continue to regard it as harming him if he is killed , mutilated or put in prison . There are good reasons for regarding death , injury , // and imprisonment as entrenched evils , evils entrenched in our whole conceptual structure . ' Indeed , unless there were some things commonly regarded as harms , there would , as we have seen , be no basis for any community at all . A number of men whose sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common passions , no common sym-pathies , no common life . Each would indeed be an island . There must be some concept of harm , and some things regarded as harmful if there is to be any community at all . Men being constituted as they are , they invariably regard death , injury , and imprisonment as harmful , but not only these . A man is harmed by being exposed to infection , by having his reputation blackened , by being sacked from his job , by being kept in ignorance , perhaps even by being corrupted morally or spiritually . What is regarded as harmful depends upon the common values of the community and the ideal patterns of life cherished by it : to interfere with the neighbours ' television was not to cause harm in the Middle Ages ; nor is it in twentieth-century Britain to cast a spell . The concept of harm is thus an elusive one , although the para-digm cases are clear . It is therefore a dangerous one for the political philosopher to use . The paradigm cases give it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones are in fact uncertain and indefinite . When Mill asserted his " one very simple principle " , that " the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community , against his will , is to prevent harm to others " 2 he assumed that harm had a definite and limited sense , and that he was arguing for the limited Minimum State of Locke and the English Whigs.3 But almost at once he has to extend the sense of harm , if his principle is to be even remotely plausible , to ver cases of failing to give evidence in a court of justice , failing to bear one 's fair share in the common defence , failing to save a fellow creature 's life , and failing to protect the defenceless against ill-usage ? " things " Mill says " which whenever it is obviously a man 's duty to do , he may rightfully be made responsible to society for not doing " .4 // But this definition of harm in terms of obvious duties ( or , equivalently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and depends , at least in respect of what duties are obvious , on the culture and the values of the society in question . The whole of Mill 's Essay on Liberty is vitiated by the ambiguity in his use of the word harm ' . Nor is this merely a weakness in argumentation . It makes his simple principle at once too narrow and too wide . On the one hand , the libertarian State , according to Mill 's prescription , is precluded from doing many things that many lovers of Freedom may reasonably want their States to do : on the other hand it gives too little a safeguard to the individual for the exercise of liberty . For even if we do not extend the sense of harm unreasonably , there remains a large number of courses of action which we normally expect a free man to be entitled to take , which nevertheless cause some harm to some other person . If I compete successfully for a scholarship or a prize , I am in all probability doing somebody else out of it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its rival , I am depriving its rival of the profits it would otherwise have made : if I tell the truth about a blackguardly politician , I may wreck his political career . Yet in none of these cases do we regard the undoubted harm that a man 's actions will cause another as a sufficient argument for restricting his freedom . More generally , we may observe that almost all of a man 's actions that are significant are going to affect other men , and usually some for the worse . If men then are to have any significant freedom of action , it can not be defined in terms of not causing harm to others ; else the principle of Freedom will have contracted into the principle de minimis non curat lex . The concept of harm is at once too narrow , too wide , and altogether too vague to provide a criterion for freedom : rather , it describes an argument , a reason for restricting freedom , though not a conclusive one . If we start with the question , Why should he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Because he will thereby harm somebody else ' is an answer ; only , it is possible to accept the fact alleged , of his action being harmful to another , and nevertheless continue to maintain that he still ought to be allowed to act , the harmful consequences to another notwithstanding . The general reason for this is that we regard men as agents , active beings , rather than as patients , sentient suffering beings ; and therefore regard freedom of action as a greater good than security against suffering ; as indeed is witnessed by our paradigm cases of harms ? death , injury , and imprisonment ? which are pre-eminent evils only if it is pre-eminently good to be able to act . We have a nonRESTRICTIONS // anaesthetic , non-analgesic view of life . Life is vivid , vivacious , full of vitality ; a doing , not an anodyne . And therefore in general we do not regard it as a sufficient reason for stopping a man from doing something that he will harm someone else by doing it . The balance still tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ourselves at the cost of being slaves to other people 's sensibilities . We therefore reject Mill 's " very simple principle " . If we take ' harm ' in a limited , definite sense , there are other reasons for restricting liberty besides harm : Public Interest for example , Equity , the maintenance of public standards , perhaps the maintenance of morality . Although it might be contended that each of these could be considered as being really founded on the need to secure some person or persons against some sort of harm , it makes for clarity of argument if we separate these arguments from those where a definite harm is being done to a definite person . We therefore say that the prevention of harm to others is not the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised . We also say that the prevention of harm to others is often not an adequate justification for exercising power against a member of a civilised community . In all cases , except the paradigm cases ? death , injury , imprisonment ( together with physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than , physical injury ) ? the argument from harm is not conclusive : it gives a reason , but the argument can continue , and the prevention of harm may , on balance , be deemed an inadequate reason for imposing a certain restriction . This is not to say that we never decide to restrict men 's freedom in order to ensure their fellows ' security against harms other than the paradigm ones , but only that the argument is complicated , and many considerations are involved . SECTION 4i RESTRICTIONS ON FREEDOM THE prevention of harm to others , although the most obvious , is not the only reason for restricting Freedom . We also restrict Freedom , and sometimes rightly , on grounds of general public utility , on grounds of Equity , for the purpose of establishing conventions of meaning , in order to extend men 's control of their social environment , in the course of collective activities , and for the realisation of corporate moralities. // Let us consider first a case that falls under all these heads , and is central to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we have already seen , ' it is essential that the decision procedure of a community should be recognisable . A community is a body which can reach a common mind about what shall happen , which is able to decide between the different views held by its different members . Since men 's judgement is fallible , they will not always reach a common mind in the sense that each and every member of the community agrees to a course of action . It is therefore necessary to have a decision procedure , so that everybody can agree how a decision is to be reached , even though he may not agree with the decision . It is necessary then to secure the procedure against any possibility of there being disagreement about whether it is the procedure or not : that is , everybody must be able to recognise the agreed decision procedure as the agreed decision procedure . And therefore in every society which is not so small that every man can recognise a judge by personally identifying him , the decision procedure must be made recognisable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : in Hobbes ' words:2 " Nor is it enough the law be written , and published ; but also that there be manifest signs that it proceedeth from the will of the sovereign . For private men , when they have , or think they have force enough to secure their unjust designs , and convoy them safely to their ambitious ends , may publish for laws what they please , without , or against the legislative authority . There is therefore requisite , not only a declaration of the law , but also sufficient signs of the author and the authority . " These sufficient signs are necessarily conventional . They identify for us that process of law which we all agree to be the method of settling disputes . They therefore can be counterfeited : and if the conventions are to be preserved , men must not be free to use these conventional symbols just as they please , but must be forbidden from so doing under penalty of law . In England it is an offence under Section 1 o of the Police Act , 1919 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in 1964 Security Organisation Ltd. was convicted under this act for having had three of its employees wearing dress with the appearance of the Wolverhampton police force uniform . There was no question of the security guards doing harm to anyone by wearing police uniform . The Magistrate said , " I do not think there is anything // sinister about this whole matter in any way at all " ; but nevertheless imposed a fine of 15 with to guineas costs . The Magistrate 's decision was right . It can be defended on many grounds ; but not that of preventing harm to anyone . Any supporter of Mill 's " one , very simple principle " should consider the case of R. v. Security Organisation Ltd. , and whether we are obliged , in the name of freedom , to permit men to wear police uniform , fly the Royal Standard , or to print documents purporting to be issued " By Authority " . Prohibitions of this type are entrenched in the fabric of society . They are essential if the community is to continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer any definite harm . Considerations of Public Interest can be adduced not only to determine the balance between freedom and harm , but by itself to justify the restriction of freedom . The laws of copyright , for example , restrict men 's freedom of speech and of writing and of musical performance , because by doing so we enable authors and composers to obtain financial advantage from their labours , and this in turn encourages them to devote their energies to these rather than to other occupations . This , the most usual justification for copyright , is a pure utilitarian one : we may , in addition , feel , on grounds of Natural justice , that it is only fair that authors and composers should be given some right of property in the fruits of their labours . But in neither of these cases can it be plausibly maintained that copyright laws protect people from harm that would otherwise be inflicted on them . The laws of copyright are not created to protect an antecedent good , but protect it in order to create it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can conceive of authors ' and composers ' interests either existing or being harmed . Many restrictions on Freedom are devised in order to extend men 's control of their social and legal environment . The fact that I am not free to break my contracts is what makes contracts contracts : if contracts did not bind me , I should not be free to enter into binding contracts . It is conceptually impossible to be free both to make and to break promises . And similarly , I can not be free to dispose of my property unless I can cease to be free to use it as I will ; and if men and women are to be free to divorce each other by mutual consent , then they are not free to enter into lifelong binding commitments to each other . This consequence of Freedom loses its air of paradox if we consider // the parallel in the natural world , which we are able to control only by virtue of causal laws which can themselves be formulated in terms of impossibility . I am able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted certain conditions , for the switch to be down and the bulb not to give out light . I can lever a stone out of the soil by reason of the impossibility of the one end of the lever going down without the other going up . If there were no natural impossibilities , there would be no natural necessities ( for this is but a verbal difference ? it is necessary that p ' , means the same as it is impossible that not p ' ) , and if there were no natural necessities there would be no causes and effects , and therefore no way of effecting anything at all . In practice we can put our wishes into effect because we can play upon natural impossibilities so as to rule out the non-occurrence of that which we desire . And just as we are able to control natural phenomena by reason of natural impossibilities and natural necessities , so we want to be able to control human affairs by means of impossibilities and necessities humanly imposed . From one point of view they are restrictions : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the course of events . We sometimes restrict Freedom in the name of Equality , in order to secure equal treatment for everybody . If , for example , I engage in trade , I may be required not to refuse any customer who tenders the purchase price of goods I have in stock . The railways , in Britain , are common carriers : they must carry every consignment , in proper condition and properly paid for , that is presented to them for carriage . An innkeeper can not turn away a traveller , unless he is dirty or drunk or disorderly . We may go further , and require that the same price be charged to every man for the same article or same service . Nobody is obliged to engage in trade : but if he chooses to do so , he is not free to pick and choose his customers , but must treat all corners equally . These requirements of Equality could be justified on other grounds . Often we can demand Equality on the ground that otherwise any person discriminated against suffers harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread , I may not be able to find any alternative source of supply , because there will not be enough demand , in view of his readiness to supply everybody else except me . We can also argue that the general utility of knowing that one will not be discriminated against outweighs the slight loss of freedom required : if one could not be reasonably confident that on arrival in a strange town one could find a place to spend the night , travel would become a much more risky and // tedious business : a French housewife who haggles in the market may sometimes secure a better bargain than her English counterpart who sees the goods priced and must either take them or leave them ; but the Englishwoman is saved much wear and tear , and if she sometimes does not get the best of the bargain , she never gets the worst of it , nor ever need fear that she has been diddled . Nevertheless the demand for this sort of Equality is not based merely on the fact that it secures some people against some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather , an assimilation of public acts to official acts , and subject to the same requirement of Equality before the Law . ' The rationale of the assimilation is given by the part played by money in the transaction . Money is a conventional token of value . z The State , in issuing coins , provides us with units , qualitatively identical and numerically distinct , and in suppressing forgery it guarantees the value of the coinage . A trader in accepting coins , relies heavily on this facility provided by the State , and can fairly be re-quired in return that just as he can be sure that one coin is as good as another , so he shall regard one man 's money as being as good as another 's ; and just as he can rely on the value of the money he accepts , others shall be entitled to rely on the acceptability of the money they offer . Money would be of no value to the trader if he had no safeguard against forgery : money would be of no value to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it to buy goods . Hence , where all that one party to a commercial transaction does is to receive money , he is under an obligation to accept money tendered without discriminating between the people offering money ; but only where one side to the transaction is purely monetary , on a cash basis . A trader is not obliged to offer credit to customers equally readily or on equal terms ; nor is he obliged to treat all corners equally , if their side of the bargain is not to be discharged in purely monetary terms . A school can properly refuse a pupil , who offers good money , if they think he will be unruly , or un-teachable : a landlord may choose as tenant the man who will take the greatest care of his property : a customer may buy in one shop rather than another , because he likes its wares better . And we can go further than this : the grounds of discrimination need not be relevant ones . A school ( unless it is a State-school , under a special duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachability , I8o ALTERNATIVES AND HOMES but because of their great-uncle 's connexion with the school : a land-lord may choose for his tenant not the best farmer , but the most enthu-siastic hunter of foxes : and the customer may buy his wares not at the shop which gives best value for money , but at the one whose manager is a friend . This is Freedom . The rule against discrimination is ( for private individuals , not for public authorities ) limited in scope ; and outside its limits the man who is doing the discriminating is often the sole judge of the relevance of his reasons for discriminating . ' Only where , thanks to the qualitative identity of monetary tokens , we can reasonably lay down a rigid rule that everybody 's money is to be equally acceptable , do we do so . It seems fair to exact this condition when from the nature of the transaction , all that the trader is interested in is the customer 's money . But in all other cases , where one man is dealing with others not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will perform different duties with different degrees of reliability and competence , he is reasonably entitled to make some discriminations between them ; and therefore by us , who love liberty , he is in fact allowed to make almost any discrimination . SECTION 43 ALTERNATIVES AND HOMES THE prevention of harm to others , although not the only , is the most important reason for restricting Freedom . Not only is a certain measure of security a sine qua non of all human activities , but in balancing the liberty of one man to do X against another man 's security that X should not be done , the two facets of Freedom are in direct and inevitable conflict . Freedom here is opposed not to any other political ideal , but to itself . There is no simple formula for striking the balance between one man 's liberty and another 's security . It is , rather , a matter of weighing arguments . There are arguments , nearly always , in favour of liberty : there are arguments , nearly always , in favour of security . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main arguments , and further arguments in turn against these . It is im-impossible to lay down rules for conducting , or for settling , such arguments . One very general consideration , however , is nearly always // applicable , and of great value . It is the consideration of alternatives . On the side of liberty , we consider ( i ) what other means are available to the agent for bringing about the same desired result , ( ii ) what other state of affairs would constitute the same action of the agent , and ( iii ) what other actions would be almost as satisfactory to a reasonable man as the action objected to . Similarly , on the side of security , we consider how the harm feared may be ( i ) avoided , ( ii ) compensated for , and ( iii ) guarded against , and at what price . We have little compunction in forbidding a man from doing one thing , if there are other things he could do equally well . Nor do we take steps to secure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the whole argument between freedom and harm is conducted not simply in the indicative mood , the actions actually done and the harms endured , but in the subjunctive mood , actions that a man could have done , might have done or should have done , and the harms that need not have been endured , could have been made up for , or should have been foreseen . It is an argument of counterfactual hypotheticals rather than of categorical assertions . This is why the argument is indeterminate , and lacks any sort of decision procedure ; and it is because we are considering the alternatives open to a reasonable man , that our conclusions depend on our view of man , and the ideal pattern of life . We are , in general , able to resolve the conflict between liberty and security by adducing alternatives , because we have a standard device for providing each man with alternatives , differing only inessentially , In its position in time and space , from the alternative objected to . This is the home , in which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men 's unwelcome attentions . Because men have separate homes , we can in general provide a modicum both of freedom and security . Often , what I am not allowed to do in public ? e.g. walking shout naked ? I am allowed to do in the privacy of my own home : and , far more often , if I want immunity from other men 's action , I can obtain it by withdrawing into the security of my own home . Homes are , almost literally , spheres of influence . Although , as we have seen , // all the problems of human conduct can not be solved by simply dividing up the world into spheres of influence ? in part , because men want to interact with one another , and not to be altogether isolated ? , yet the idea is a natural one , and by assigning men their private spheres , we do ease , even if we do not abolish , conflicts between one man 's freedom and another man 's security , by providing the one or the other with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spheres of influence does not provide a complete solution to the problem of human conflict . It fails , obviously , where actions performed at home harm other people outside the home ? television interference for example . It does not apply to all those activities which are not confined to the home . It can not apply in serious criminal cases , nor in many other cases if the law is to be in the least effective . An Englishman 's home is his castle , but not if he murders people there , nor if he runs an illicit still , nor if he harbours fugitives from justice . Nor again will an Englishman 's house count as his home if he uses it for the purpose of trade ; then it will only be his shop , and as such much more liable to regulation : for then he is acting not towards certain particular persons but towards members of the public in general ; and in so far as he uses money ? a facility provided by the State ? the State , as we have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is in part the nature of our activities as well as the locale that deter-mines whether they are purely private or a matter of public concern ; and , especially , the exact description of the other persons concerned , whether they are to be regarded as simply certain specified individuals , what logicians call a " closed " class , or whether they are to be regarded , rather , as falling under a more general description , a chance selection from what logicians call an " open " class.2 In the latter case , the interests and sensibilities of the general public , the common good , and common ideas about the texture of life , afford reasons for restricting freedom , which do not apply to private actions performed in private ; or better , we should take the public as the standard case , from which we except private cases , where we can , through the devices of the home and private property , in order to enable them to have alterna-tives , both of actions and of safeguards , which can not be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case is the exception from the public one , rather than vice versa , can be seen if we consider that we are often prepared not only to allow in private actions which if done in public would be P11OPtIl Y 183 forbidden , but to allow , where no financial advantage is obtained , actions which would be forbidden if done for money . Our treatment of blackmail affords a clear case . If I discover something disreputable about another man , and disclose it , out of a sense of public duty , or from pure , disinterested ill-will , I commit no offence ; an offence is committed only if I try to make money , by threatening to disclose his secret unless he pays me money . There are good reasons why black-mail , and many other profitable activities , should be forbidden : but often what is rightly forbidden if done for profit , may be permitted if done only for fun , and Freedom is thereby enlarged , since the man who really wants to undertake the activity in question , may do so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made . The law allows me to live with a prostitute and be her protector , so long as I live with her purely for love , and not for money . SECTION 44 PROPERTY T 11 E institution of private property is analogous to that of the private home , only instead of assigning to each individual a sphere of influence all of his own , it assigns each " good " to some individual or corporate body . Private property is a legal privilege of using and disposing of some good , together with a security ( a Hohfeldian right ) ' against other people using or disposing of it . If I own something I am at liberty to use it , and other people have a duty not to use it without my permission : and I have a Hohfeldian power of disposing of some or all of my privileges , that is to say , of authorising other people to use and dispose , and of renouncing my own privileges and powers . We naturally think of property as land or material objects to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownership . But this is wrong . For , first , property need not be constituted by land or material objects . The copyright of a certain book , play , or tune is property without being either . We may feel that this is an artificial example , as Indeed it is . We have seen2 that copyright is created by laws for-bidding copying without permission . With land or material objects the privative sense of privilege is naturally given ? if I am to be free to // use it as I will , you can not be : with books , plays and tunes , being universals rather than particulars , there is no natural privation ? my singing a tune does not in the least prevent your singing it too ? and so we need special laws to enable universals to be owned in the way that particulars can . Thus , while there is a natural tendency for property to consist either of areas of the public world which agents inhabit in common or of material objects in the public world , it need not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places and things , it becomes easier to see also that ownership is not a simple relation of attachment but a complicated bundle of rights , , and privileges . And once we have seen this , we can see further that the different privileges , rights , and powers need not always go together . The mediaeval Church taught that landowners were entitled only to the usufruct of their land , but ought not to sell the land itself . We go further , and restrict the privilege of the owner of land to certain sorts of use only ? e.g , agricultural use . Or again , in the Church of England , the parson has a freehold in his benefice , which secures to him the use of the revenues , but does not entitle him to transfer the benefice to another , but only to resign it : while the patron has the advowson , which entitles him to appoint a new parson on the death or resignation of the old one , but can not touch the revenues . Thus , quite apart from any modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrosanct as some philosophers have made out . Locke and the Americans over-emphasised the importance of property , partly because of Locke 's nominalism , partly because in the yeoman economy the ownership of land secured to a man who was willing to work a liveli-hood that was independent of all other men . Security of property came next only to that of life and liberty , and was an effective guarantee of Constitutional Freedom . With the change in the economy from a static agricultural one to a dynamic one , the pre-eminent importance of property has been eroded . The tenure of jobs is often felt to be as important as the freehold of land . This is not to say that property is not important : but the case has to be re-examined and re-argued . The chief argument for property is that it is a form of Freedom . The institution of private property can help resolve the conflict between one man 's liberty and another 's , in the same way as the institution of private homes . For it is true of most goods that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so one man 's having exclusive rights over // one piece of property leaves it open for another man to have equally exclusive rights over a comparable piece , affording him reasonably acceptable alternative courses of action and enjoyment . I am free to drive in my car to Penzance , and you in yours to Inverness . It is reasonable to curtail your freedom to drive in my car to a place of your choosing , because it is in general possible for you to acquire a car of your own . And in this way , private property , like the private home , enables men to have some acceptable alternative action open to them , and some acceptable alternative for avoiding the effects of other men 's action . This argument works where we have a number of articles , more or less similar , so that each man may have one , in much the same way as each has a home . Where it is in principle impossible for there to be a second piece of property more or less resembling the first , e.g. with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying our ordinary laws of property . For the most part , however , the concept of ownership is so widely and well understood , and the institution of property has so many other advantages besides the one adduced here , that we tend to apply the laws of property wherever possible , even at the cost of some awkwardness . In particular , there are strong arguments from Freedom and from Public Interest for the institution of private property . Property is a freedom ? a legal privilege ? in using and disposing . Although some times it is good to make men accountable for what they do ? how they use and how they dispose ? it is neither feasible nor desirable to make men always accountable . The general arguments for Freedom carry over to property . What agents inhabiting a common world are most likely to quarrel about is either the occupation of a certain area or volume of their common world or the handling of some movable object in it . Therefore it is natural to define disputes or potential disputes with reference to particular areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority to decide what shall happen in these areas or volumes , or to these movable objects , to some person or persons or body of persons . And although this authority can be conferred in the form of an office , so that those who hold the authority are accountable for its exercise , there are arguments , as we have seen , ' for not doing this as a general rule . And hence there is a general argument in favour of private property . ' ? 38. // Such a general argument does not show that the rights of private property are absolute , or ought to be unfettered , or that the rules ought to be just as they are now . Since property ( or ownership ) is not a primitive concept , but is constituted by a complex of rules , there is no reason thus far why the rules of use and of disposal should not be different from those now in force . It might well be possible to alter them for the better . All that we need to bear in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concession to men 's selfishness , and rules which impose too much unselfishness are likely to fail in their effect . just as clever conveyancing clerks were able to find ways round most of the statutes Parliament used to pass about landed property , so now , if we alter the rules we must consider how selfish men , out to maximise their own interests without regard to the intention of the law , will play the rules , and may circumvent our purpose in revising the rules . Nor is this altogether wrong : after all , part of the point of property was to act as a safety valve , and to be something that people could legitimately be selfish about . The rights of property are not , and never have been absolutely absolute . Always they have been fettered by various legal obligations . The landowner must not deprive his neighbour 's land of support , by excavating his own up to the boundary : he must not allow the use of his land to be a nuisance to his neighbours : and the old principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Town and Country Planning Acts , so that now landowners , very properly , have been deprived of the absolute right to spoil the view . Equally , the owner of a car or a wireless set is not allowed to use it without a licence . The owner of a patent may be legally obliged to grant a licence to use it . The owner of a work of art may not sell it abroad just as he likes . A Scotsman may not leave his property to whomsoever he will , but must give a share to his wife and his children . All these , and many other , restrictions on the absolute rights of property are feasible , and may be desirable . But they remain minor qualifications on the general principle of absolute discretion in using and disposing . And this is a special case , defined usually with reference to places or things , of the more general principle of Freedom . A man may do as he likes with his own ? by definition , for we define his own as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of homes and private property often resolves the conflict between one man 's freedom to act and another man 's security from harm , by giving one party or the other an outlet or a safeguard // which will not threaten the security or restrict the freedom of the other . It is a method of evading the conflict rather than of deciding it , and sometimes the method will not be available , and always we shall have to decide in the public sphere whether Freedom or Security is to be preferred . The argument from alternatives often still applies . In walking along the highway , it is easy for me to alter my course to avoid bumping another man who has stopped to tie his shoe-lace ; my freedom is restricted in order to provide security for him : but for longer waits , the position is reversed , and the other man 's freedom to remain stationary for long periods is restricted to give me security against obstruction in my passage along the highway . For it is a very small alteration for me to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my business , whereas there is no reasonable alternative to stopping for the man whose shoe-lace has come undone : but it is not reasonable for me to be delayed for a long time , or for a large number of other people to be inconvenienced by obstruction . The balance of inconvenience in such cases is , however , never all one way , and seldom decisive ; and therefore we adopt different solutions for different types of case ; we are harder on parked cars than on stationary humans ; on a clearway or motorway , at the one extreme , we will not allow any obstruction at all , while in a market-place , at the other extreme , not only may people be in the same place for hours on end , but they may be allowed to put up stalls . Not only does the existence of private property sometimes fail to avoid conflict , but often it generates it . Meum and tuum may delimit " spheres of influence " in which each one of us in entitled to exercise an undisputed sway , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly the boundaries are to be drawn . Not all goods are qualitatively identical to other goods . The paradigm example of cars , where because each can have one of the same model , neither need quarrel with the other about the use of either car , is not a typical case . Many goods are qualitatively unique : some because no other article happens to be exactly like it ? for example , a particular piece of furniture ; some in view of an extrinsic circumstance ? there are other fountain pens which are just like this one , but this is the one my father used , and therefore is unique in my eyes ; some , as we have seen , , because they are of a logical type where to be numerically distinct is I p. 185. // necessarily to be qualitatively different also ? if you and I each own the copyright of a symphony , the symphonies are necessarily dissimilar , and are not qualitatively identical in the way that two Morris Minors may be . Landed property is necessarily unique . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are necessarily located in a different place , and it is by its location that landed property is defined . Landed property therefore is the sort which poses the greatest problems . The ownership of land is , like that of a movable object , naturally privative , and not , like that of a copyright , only artificially so ; and yet land , like a copyright , is essentially unique , and not , like a movable object in principle reproducible . Since we all always have to occupy some place or other , and since for most of human history it is only by cultivating land that a man has been able to supply his material wants , it is natural that there have been more disputes about the ownership and occupancy of places than of any other sort . In particular , rulers from Ahab to the latest Minister of Town and Country Planning , have coveted the lands of their subjects , and subjects from the time of Naboth to the present day have sought to preserve their ancestral acres intact . Disputes about property may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of property an individual owns . As soon as we have money ? even before ? , we begin to measure wealth , and draw comparisons . The poor may envy the rich , the rich despise the poor , and the middle classes strive to keep up with the Joneses . Money enables many disputes to be resolved , and is a great buttress of Freedom , but the love of money can cause many further quarrels and can lead to a sort of tyranny . The great virtue of money is that it widens the range of alternatives open to an individual at any one time . There are a large number of conventional tokens ? coins , bank-notes ? qualitatively identical , each of the same , conventional , value ; and therefore my money is as good as yours , and yours as good as mine , and any third person has the alternative open to him of dealing with me if he does not like you , and vice versa : and , similarly , you and I have the alternative of dealing with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not have to exchange goods for goods , but can exchange goods for money or money for goods , and can exchange a greater or smaller quantity of money for some particular goods ; and thus our dealings are greatly facilitated , and the liberty of each greatly extended . We pay two prices for this liberty . The first is impersonality . Money is anonymous . Modern thinkers , especially since Marx , have deplored // the fact that the cash nexus is impersonal , and yearn for a more complete , cosier form of economic organisation . But total cosiness would be suffocating . If I am always to treat other people entirely as ends-inthemselves and never in the least bit merely as means , then I can never do anything simply for the reason that I want to do it . Per contra , if any man is ever to be in any way free , then there will be someone whom some time he will be entitled to treat , if only by omission , not fully as a person with a complete set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . My relations with a shop-keeper , businessmen , ticket-collector are necessarily to some degree impersonal because I am free to go to another shop , deal with another firm , travel by another line to another destination . This is not to say that I am entitled to treat shop-keepers , business-men , or ticket-collectors merely as means , and not at all as ends-in-themselves . I am not entitled to murder , rob or defraud them : nor ought I to be rude to them . But there is a certain impersonality in my relation to them , which is simply the reverse side of the coin of Freedom . And therefore , although we may complain that modern life , dominated by a money economy , is too impersonal , and seek ways of humanising modern institutions , we can not legitimately complain of its being at least to some extent impersonal , for that is just what we want it to be , in as much as we want to be free , free , among other things , to neglect on occasion the personality ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second price we may have to pay for economic freedom is the loss of economic security . It is easy to overplay this loss . The landless labourer of the last century who was forced into the factory to sell the work of his hands was indeed in a bad plight : but so too the landless labourer of all ages , who did not have the wherewithal to keep himself alive . Because of our recurrent needs for food , clothing , warmth , medical attention , we are all vulnerable . Many have been insecure , many unfortunate . Economic freedom does not in general make people worse off or more insecure : on the contrary , it has in general made people better off , and the landless labourer who would have starved in the time of Hesiod is able in an industrial society to find alternative means of securing subsistence . Nevertheless , even though most people may be better off , some are more insecure . Milliners , and other purveyors of female fashion goods , are the paradigm example ; but also all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of job , and then are thrown out of work by change of demand , technological progress , economic crises , bad management or restrictive trade union
