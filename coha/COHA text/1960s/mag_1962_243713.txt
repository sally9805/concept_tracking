" Are you with us ? " bellowed the big man on the platform . " Yes ! " roared some 20,000 farmers and their wives in Des Moines ' Veterans Memorial Auditorium . <P> With that assurance , President Oren Lee Staley of the militant National Farmers Organization last week announced what everyone in the building had come to cheer-a strike against food processors to force higher prices for many farm products . " This is a battle for survival of family-type agriculture , " said Staley . <P> " American farmers have retreated as far as they can . We do not intend to retreat any further . " Staley heads an organization that , since its founding in 1955 , has enlisted an estimated 180,000 families and become the nation 's fourth largest farm group-after the American Farm Bureau Federation , the National Grange and the National Farmers Union . With branches in 16 states , the N.F.O. 's center of strength is among Iowa 's dirt farmers . <P> No Subsidies . The guiding principle of the N.F.O. is that the U.S. farm mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even to the point of striking against the food processors . Staley admits that such strikes , if successful , would raise retail food prices ; but he argues that the U.S. taxpayer would find the increase well worth it . Reason : if the farmer were protected by contracts achieved through collective bargaining , there would be no need for the Government to fork out billions of dollars in subsidy payments . <P> Owner of a 400-acre hog-and-cattle farm near Rea , Mo. , Staley , 39 , directs the N.F.O. with evangelistic fervor and a shrewd eye . When the Committee for Economic Development issued a report in July saying that the number of U.S. <P> farmers should somehow be reduced by one-third during the next five years , Staley noted that one committee member was a Ford executive , another a Sears , Roebuck official . Staley promptly organized demonstrations against both companies . Farmers protested to their bewildered Ford dealers , returned their Sears catalogues by the thousands . In the end , both Ford and Sears issued statements pointing out that the officials had worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company representatives . <P> Try , Try Again . At his press conference last week , President Kennedy expressed sympathy , of a sort , for the N.F.O. 's aim of achieving higher farm income . But he pointed out that farmer strikes had failed in the past . Three times before , the N.F.O. has tried brief , experimental strikes without noticeably influencing prices . At week 's end , as the strike began , Staley admitted frankly that some of his members might not be willing to stick it out indefinitely . " It will be after the second week-possibly the third-before we can get down to the farmers who really mean to hold for whatever length of time is necessary . I think we 've got the strength to win contracts this time . If we do n't , we 'll try again . We 're not giving up . You can issue protests just so long before your reason for existence goes poof .
