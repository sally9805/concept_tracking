txt President Johnson , with limited room for maneuver , is struggling to keep his new budget in the vicinity of $110-billion . Actual spending in the current fiscal year has already soared . November outlays for all Federal programs were the ! highest for a month in history , rfar above October or a year ago . Some special , nonrecurring factors were involved in the month , but a strong upward trend of spending is now confirmed . Total spending in the regular or administrative budget in the fiscal year 1965 , which ended six months ago on June 30 , was $96.5-billion . The latest official estimate for the current year , now half over , is $105-billion to $107-billion . New Budget a High Many experts believe it will be extremely difficult for the President to keep the new budget for the fiscal year 1967 , starting next July 1 , as low as $110-billion . The war in Vietnam accounts for a good part , but not all , of the actual and prospective increase in spending . The President is reliably reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new budget presented to him last month in Texas by his budget director , Charles L. Schultze . Mr. Schultze , it is reported , was instructed to come // back with a much smaller total . Officials are reluctant to discuss actual figures , either the total or individual components of the budget . The President may yet have some surprises . But evidence from a variety of sources point to a twofold conclusion . First , there is a severe squeeze on domestic spending and on defense spending not directly related-to the build-up of the armed forces and the war itself . It is doubtful , however , that the drive to cut back is more intense than it has been in the last two budgets . " This is a tough approach , " said an official of the Budget Bureau , " but this President has been tough before . It is hard to say whether the squeeze is worse now than it was a year ago or the year before that . " Second , the defense build-up , together with a series of decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will mean a sizable increase in the next budget . Budget receipts in the next fiscal year can be expected to increase to $105-billion or even a little more . If Mr. Johnson can hold the spending total to $110-14lion , he would probably see no needfor a tax increase . Tax Rise Decision Pending However , the more the prospective spending total rises above the $110-billion figure , ' the more compelling the economic case for a. tax increase would become . The President 's decision on this issue is pending . As the budget takes shape , reports from various Government agencies paint a broadly similar picture . Programs will not be allowed to proceed at the maximum rate authorized by law or desired by the agencies , but many will show some increases . For example , it has been learned that the dozen new programs in the field of higher education just enacted by Congress will not be financed to the authorized ceiling of $800 million . Spending in this area , however , will still be significantly higher than in the current year . There may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there will be expansion in others . Although the ' start of the new regional heartcancer-stroke medical centers may be delayed , funds will go to several new programs approved by Congress this year . Several secondary space projects have been delayed or killed , such as the proposed orbit of the sun by an unmanned space vehicle . The Apollo moon program will proceed , however , and the total space budget will be no lower than in the current fiscal year . Depressed Areas Cited It has been disclosed that the new program of public works and industrial loans to help depressed areas will get under way at a pace less than authorized by Congress , but the program will not be stopped altogether . The same is true for the rural development program . Sargent Shriver 's Office of Economic Opportunity reportedly asked for a large increase in funds , amounting to more than $1-billion , and will not get it , ' : , although some increase from ; this year 's $1.5-billion level is likely . In some areas , Mr. Johnson himself has reportedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ' Budget Bureau . For exampled Secretary of State Dean Rusk is said to have won restoration of a cut of about $40-million that ' would have severely hampered ; routine shifts of posts by For- ! eign Service personnel . In the domestic area general-il ly , a highly authoritative source said unequivocally earlier this ' month , " the President is not going to sacrifice the Great Society . " Built-in Increases Apart from new and expanded programs in the Great Society , area  --  education , health , weal fare , antipoverty , antipollution and the like  --  there will be several built-in increases in the budget . The most important will be an increase , amounting almost certainly to more than $500-million , in interest on the ; national debt . This comes about because the debt will be larger and interest rates are higher . As for defense , the latest report is that spending will be estimated in the new budget at $60-billion , or very close to that level . This would he a rise of between $5-billion and $6-billion in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been announced in estimated spending on farm programs , but the amount is not known . It has also been disclosed that total spending in the Department of Health , Education and Welfare will rise , possibly substantially . Increases in one major area , public assistance grants to the states , were announced today to take effect Jan. 1 . They will affect the next budget more than the current one . A measure of the upward spending pressure has already come in results for the current fiscal year to date . Counting all programs  --  those In the regular budget and those such as Social Security that are financed through trust funds ? Federal spending in November was at an annual rate of $145.8-billion , far higher than any previous month on record . The figure for November a year ago was $112.9-billion . Counting just administrative budget outlays , November 's annual spending rate was $109-billion . For the first five months of the current fiscal year the spending rate , was $104.5-billion , and defense spending is still heading up .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
