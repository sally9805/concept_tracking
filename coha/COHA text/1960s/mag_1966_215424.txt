There always seems to be some excuse for violence in the Congo , and the violence nearly always involves either Kisangani , the city once known as Stanleyville , or Katanga , the stronghold of exiled ex-Premier Moise Tshombe . In the past few weeks , it has involved both . <P> The problem began in July , when Kisangani was seized by its garrison of Katangese gendarmes , a tough and trou blesome outfit that in theory was incorporated into the Congolese National Army , but whose first loyalty had al ways been to Tshombe . To put down the rebellion , President Joseph Mobutu promised to send the gendarmes back to Katanga - even though he feared that once they were there , the Kats might be used by Tshombe to start another civil war . Mobutu lived up to his prom ise . He made available four transport planes to fly Kisangani 's 2,500 gendarmes and their families back home . <P> 14 Beer Trucks . That was not exactly what the Kats had in mind . They had been methodically looting Kisangani 's shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not planes but trucks . They should have left well enough alone , for Mobutu fortnight ago turned the new dispute into an excuse to go back on his word . Instead of sending them trucks , he ordered his army to surround Kisangani and crush the Kats once and for all . <P> It was a remarkably successful maneuver . Storming into the city , government troops killed scores of gendarmes and drove hundreds of others into the bush . Part of the Katangese force managed to escape in a column that included 14 commandeered beer trucks and all the city 's ambulances , but it did not get far . When reconnaissance planes spotted it on the highway south toward Katanga last week , Mobutu dispatched troops to a river crossing 450 miles from Kisangani , where the Kats were virtually wiped out . An ambush destroyed the first trucks to cross the river , and Congolese air force planes took care of the rest , leaving the survivors to sue for peace to make their way on foot the remaining 1,500 miles to Katanga . <P> Diplomatic Break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack on his enemies everywhere . Tshombe , he claimed , was using his exile in Madrid to mount a plot against the Congo 's military government , hiring mercenaries in Europe , training them in southern France , and , with Portuguese collusion , massing troops across the Congolese border in Angola . <P> Tshombe and the Portuguese government denied everything , but none of the disclaimers had any effect . Still ranting about " the satanic plans of the enemies of our country , " Mobutu last week broke relations with Portugal and ordered all foreign countries , friend and foe alike , to close their consulates in the Congo 's interior .
