When an odd-looking craft called the H. S. Denison slipped down the ways into Long Island 's Oyster Bay last week , it was a big event in the U.S. shipping world . <P> The Denison , built by Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp . for the U.S. Maritime Administration , is the U.S. 's first high speed hydrofoil ferryboat . But in Italy , hydrofoil ferries are old hat . Neapolitans scarcely spare a glance any more for the sleek , 140-passenger aliscafi ( winged hulls ) that skim out across the Bay of Naples four times a day on the tourist run to Capri 18 miles away . <P> The man who put the Italians comfortably out in front in commerical hydrofoil development is Carlo Rodriquez , 51 , a tall , reticent Sicilian engineer whose Spanish ancestors settled in Italy 150 years ago . Since 1958 Rodriquez has turned out 42 hydrofoil ferries at his 500-man Messina shipyard . Today , his aliscafi wing between Venice and Trieste , thread the fjords of Norway , link Caribbean islands , and are about to begin regular service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3,100,000 worth of hydrofoils ; this year , with $1,800,000 in sales so far , he expects to do substantially better . <P> Legacy from Adolf . A trip in a Rodriquez hydrofoil is like water-skiing in a bus . Projecting down from the ferry 's trim speedboat hull are legs with winglike metal skis on the end . As the ship picks up speed , the hull rises out of the water and skims along on its skis . Because it has only the drag of the skis , a Rodriquez hydrofoil needs only half the power of a conventional boat to achieve the same speed . More important , its top speed is three times that of the average conventional ferryboat-which means that it can move three times as many passengers in a day . <P> Rodriquez ' aliscafi come in two models : the 72-passenger PT 20 , which is driven by a 1,350-h.p . Daimler-Benz V12 engine and will make up to 40 knots , and the 140-passenger PT 50. which has two V-12s and does 37 knots . Both were designed by Austrian Engineer Friedrich Lobau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his second as a prisoner of war in Russia . ( The Russian model , he now says . <P> he carefully constructed in such a way that it sank the first time he demonstrated it to Soviet naval officers . ) After the war , Lobau ran out of funds trying to develop a commercial hydrofoil in Switzerland . <P> Rodriquez , anxious to expand his family 's 61-year-old shipyard , bought Lobau out and has kept him at work in Messina ever since . <P> Volga Boatmen . Rodriquez ' success has spawned numerous competitors . The Russians , despite Lobau , now have a 150-passenger hydrofoil plying the Volga . <P> Grumman 's Denison , which is 32 tons heavier than the PT 50 and designed to go twice as fast , is expected to be the forerunner of 80-knot hydrofoils capable of coping with open ocean . This August Boeing will launch a hydrofoil subchaser for the U.S. Navy .
