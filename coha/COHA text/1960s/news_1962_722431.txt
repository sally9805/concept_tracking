txt LONDON , May 9 ( A  --  A young American skin diver who plunged 300 feet to the wreck of the Lusitania has uncovered indications the Germans may have been right in saying the liner carried munitions when they sank it 47 years ago . The famous British passenger ship went to the bottom of the Atlantic on May 7 , 1915 , 20 minutes . after being struck by a German torpedo . Of the 1,950 persons on board , 1,198 died . Among the drowned were nearly 200 Americans , and the sinking , as much as any other single event , set the mood for United States entry two years later into World War I. Take Underwater Photos Later the Germans claimed they were justified in treating the Lusitania as a ship of war because she , was carrying munitions and may have been armed . In an attempt to clear up the mystery , John Light , 23 , of Elmhurst , N. Y. , led a team of divers to investigate the wreck 10 miles off the south coast of Ireland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night . Light 's findings led him to believe the wreck of the Lusttania has been tampered with . A section of steel deck appears to have been cut away with torches . Evidence of Explosion Light also photographed a heavy steel door bent like cardboard , sheared from its fastenings . Everything suggests an explosion op the side away from the torpedo , " . said a commentator , Patrick Thoughton , of the British Broadcasting corporation . The American diver also lo- , cated a flying bridge projecting from the upturned side of the Lusitania . He found that two holes had been roughly driven into the bridge and what looked like a mooring wire had beat shackled in . Only one other expedition - so far as is known  --  has ever gone down to the wreck . This was a private venture in 1935 . It did not use mooring wire sub as Light found . There is no dispute that the ship was designed to carry guns . The British claim , however , it was unarmed ? when torpedoed . Light found no gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maurice Harvey , BBC television producer , who worked with Light on the project , said : " The evidence seems to indicate the wreck has been tampered with . Light believes British admiralty divers have been down to remove the ship 's guns . Calls Evidence Sketchy " Personally , I believe the evidence for this is sketchy , and none of the survivors we have interviewed has recalled seeing guns aboard . " There is more evidence that the Lusitania was carrying ammunition . The ship 's manifest , Harvey said , showed the cargo included 4,000 cases of ? small arms ammunition . At least one survivor remembered hearing three explosions . The log of the German submarine U-20 states that it fired only one torpedo and that the detonation was followed by a larger , . inteYnal , explosion . Whether it was caused by ' ammunition in ' the ship 's cargo has never been firmly established . But Light 's investigation indicates it may have been .                  @ @ @
