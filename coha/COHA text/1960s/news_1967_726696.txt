txt Mail : The Young and the Old pg . 465 Mail : The Young and the Old To THE EDITOR : BECAUSE I am a frequent user of the youth fares offered by most domestic airlines , it was with great dismay that I read David Gollan 's article of Oct. 22 , in which he reported that the American Society of Travel Agents is seeking to eliminate this privilege . A.S.T.A. claims that most youth travelers bypass its services , While this is probably true , I wonder if the agents have ever considered how much good this opportunity for youth to travel at half-fare does for their industry . This policy enables youth to experience the convenience and pleasure that air travel has to offer ( most of the time , anyway ) at fares that are not prohibitive to their budgets . By the time the youths pass the age of eligibility for this fare ( 22 ) , they will have established a taste for travel and will inevitably find their way to the agents to book not only air passage but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they could spend previously . I am confident that the orients will get their share of our travel dollar eventually if they do not make thousands of enemies by seeking the abolishment of this fare . After all , no one stays under 21 forever . ROBERT BEARD . Doylestown , Pa . SENIOR CITIZEN PLEA To THE EDITOR : I am a senior citizen in reasonably good health , and have many friends in the same category . Why is n't some provision made for us to travel at a reduced rate , like youth fares ? The airlines encourage young people to fly , hoping to make them air-minded in adult life . We already are . It is certainly a loss for ships or airliners to be two-thirds full or less ; we are eager to take up the slack . I have always dreamed of retiring and travel . So who travels ? One tiny trip a year ! Could n't something be worked out , either on an off-season or standby basis , for both overseas and domestic travel ? MRS . MORRIS SCHNEIDER . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDITOR : I must join the list of those who have written about the " drinks and food " service on the airlines . We have just returned from a vacation trip to California . We boarded the plane at 1 P.M. , and at 1:10 the drinks were being served . By the time the stewardesses got through asking 125 people what they wanted to drink ( many did not want anything ) and then served them , well over an hour had gone by . My husband and I were starving . Breakfast was many hours behind us , and we wanted lunch , not a drink . Finally , the stewardesses started serving food . We had the misfortune of sitting in the front of the plane , and were not served until 4:20 P.M. ; by that time , we were beyond caring . We realize that it takes time to serve food aloft , but it could be done a lot easier if one stewardess started in the front of the cabin and another in the back . They use a little cart from which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cart and serve eight passengers at once ? Certainly , the people in the seats farthest from the galley deserve some consideration . The passengers in the rear of the plane ate well over an hour before we did . The thing that really made us angry was this : We were handed our trays and , five minutes later , the stewardess was back , asking if we were through because they had to get the movie started . MRS . R. MAGLIORE . Elmhurst , N.Y . PHOTOGRAPHY IN INDIA To THE EDITOR : The following incident may be of interest to those readers who might be planning a trip to India . For many years , my wife and I wanted to visit Kashmir , partly because of the poetic beauty that writers are always describing and partly to see the Himalaya Mountains there . We were not disappointed , for the whole area lived up to its reputation . Our troubles began on our departure . I guess we should have expected trouble when we first arrived in Srinagar , Kashmir , for three armed members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the airplane to the terminal . Most of the passengers were tourists , for Kashmir depends on the tourist trade almost entirely . All went well until we landed at New Delhi on our return . There , we were approached by four military men , who said that the captain of the plane had reported that we had taken pictures of the airport in Srinagar , and that the film in my camera must be confiscated . At first , they said we had taken pictures of military installations , but later mentioned only the airport . No amount of denial would suffice , and their request was complied with . I tried to get a receipt , and I tried , too , to find out who " they " were , since a uniform is hardly sufficient identification , but all to no avail . We took no military photographs , and saw no signs prohibiting the taking of pictures in Kashmir , so probably the incident will be closed except for the loss of some 20 color slides that can not be replaced . C. W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To THE EDITOR : In answer to C. W. Harrison 's letter about India and photography , let me say that we are very sorry if he was inconvenienced in any way while in our country . Officially , photography is not permitted at any of India 's airports , or from airplanes during take-off or landing . Prominent signs at the airports , and reminders from stewardesses on Indian Airline flights , inform tourists of this . Otherwise , photography is encouraged everywhere . MISS VATSALA PAL Government of India Tourist Office . New York . ' NATIONAL DISGRACE ' To THE EDITOR : In the Oct. 15 Travel Section , Ward Allan Howe quotes William H. Tucker , chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission , as saying : " The condition of railroad passenger service throughout our land has the makings of a national disgrace . " Mr. Tucker is right , but he did not complete the statement , which should continue : " This has been brought about by the fact that the treatment of American railroads is a national disgrace . " The railroads have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and airplane competition . They have been exhorbitantly taxed on terminal properties . They have been overly regulated by the I.C.C . They have been among the chief victims of Governmentencouraged union featherbedding . And now the Government is taking away the railway Post Office business and complaining because the railroads want to cancel passenger sevrice . MURDOCK M. MACLENNAN . North Charleston , S. C. CABS AND POLICEMEN To THE EDITOR : Coming home by bus from Montreal with some Canadian friends , I had a very unpleasant experience at the Port Authority Bus Terminal . After entering a taxi , I told the , driver that I wanted to go to Riverdale , which is in the Bronx . He immediately turned off the meter and asked for $12 . I told him that Riverdale was within the city limits , and that he had no right to ask for such an amount . He replied that he knew where Riverdale was , and that he would take us there for $10 . We got out of the taxi and wanted to report him to a policeman . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a transit strike during my stay , the taxi drivers were always polite , courteous and honest . I was ashamed that my Canadian friends should get such an impression of our city . We got a second taxi , whose metered fare amounted to $3.45 . But where are the policemen ? MRS . ADOLPH NEUSTADT . Riverdale . RIGHTING THE RECORD To THE EDITOR : The article , " Turkey Eager to Play Host , " by Terence Smith ( Oct. 22 ) , was an admirable summation of the Turkish tourist picture . To set the record straight , though , I should like to point out that the recent visit of some 250 members of the Society of American Travel Writers , which was mentioned in the article , was of 14 ? not 21 ? days ' duration , that it constituted the society 's 12th annual convention ( professional panels and meetings are combined with work-tours at these conventions , whose sites vary each year ) , and that the society 's members were not invited to Turkey at the Government 's expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the United States , and all paid a set fee for their stay in Turkey  --  a low fee , to be sure , made possible by a Government subsidy that made the Turks ' bid for this convention the most attractive of a number received by the society 's Convention Sites Committee . I can not , of course , speak for the " enthusiastic " travel agents who Mr. Smith reports have been invited to Turkey , but I can corroborate the writers ' general optimism over the future of tourism in that country .
