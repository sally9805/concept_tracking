The twangy strains of Pakistani music filled the galleries of Manhattan 's Asia House last week , but the 65 stone heads , statues and reliefs on exhibit seemed to owe almost as much to the West as to the East . On loan from the government of Pakistan , these peaceful figures are the graceful legacy of an ancient civilization that to this day remains partially wreathed in mystery . <P> The Gandhara sculptures get their name from a small , hilly region around Peshawar that at the time of Darius I ( 522-485 B.C. ) was a province of Persia . From that time until its final decline after the White Hun sacking of the 6th century A.D. , Gandhara was swept from conqueror to conqueror . It was part of India for a while , and then came the Indo-Greek dynasties founded by the captains of Alexander the Great . The Scythians fought over it ; Rome 's Emperors Augustus , Trajan and Hadrian exchanged trade missions with it . Finally , in the 3rd century , the Persians took it over again .

They were fascinated by centaurs and Tritons , and they could produce a handsome Athena or Roma , helmet and all . They dutifully gave Buddha 's head the magic bump that marked his Buddhahood-though they were likely to disguise it under a mop of hair inspired by Apollo . Buddha himself often appeared draped in a Roman toga , and some of the men could have come straight out of the Roman Senate . But while the artists borrowed , they did not copy ; the spiritual serenity of their work could have come only from the East . <P> The sculptures of Gandhara-a name that had long since vanished from the map-lay for centuries in forgotten ruins . It was not until the 1920s , when the great city of Taxila was excavated , that the happy fusion of East and West was generally recognized .

Once , when soldiers of the Queen 's Own Corps of Guides came upon some ancient reliefs , they decided to use them to decorate the fireplace of their mess hall at Mardan . As might have been expected , smoke begrimed the stones , so the ingenious Guides covered them with a coat of black shoe polish . Shoe blacking darkens some of them still .
