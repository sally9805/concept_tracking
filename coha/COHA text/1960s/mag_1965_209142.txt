Pity the city so itty and bitty that it has no film festival . Berlin 's 15th was n June ; Venice 's 26th ended two weeks ago ; Rio de Janeiro is cranking up for its first ; New York 's third just closed its doors . <P> <P> Alphaville was New York 's opener . One of the ten movies French Director Jean-Luc Godard has managed to make before the age of 35 , it won the top prize at Berlin-the Golden Bear . At Lincoln Center it seemed that a Golden Boar would have been more appropriate . So absorbed is Godard with his razzle-dazzle camera work , inside jokes , and technique of making up a movie as he goes along that he commits the bore 's besetting and inevitable sin of endless repetition-under the delusion that his audience is having as much fun as he is . <P> The film 's period is the future ; its genus , science fiction . With a secret-agent raincoat and a face like a well eroded cliff , U.S. Actor Eddie Constantine , who specializes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at a hotel in Alphaville , capital of some distant galaxy . He says he is a reporter from Figaro-Pravda , but he is really Outer-World Agent Lemmy Caution ( his name in a popular French gangster series ) on assignment to destroy Alphaville 's boss computer , Alpha 60 , and its inventor , Dr. Von Braun . <P> A bellgirl shows Lemmy to his room and in robotlike manner takes off most of her clothes . She is an official Seductress , she says , and she is about to take a bath with him . He slaps her around a bit ( " I can find my own broads " ) and sets about contacting a fellow agent ( Akim Tamiroff ) . Expiring in the arms of another Seductress , Tamiroff gasps that Lemmy must make Alpha 60 destroy itself . To this end Lemmy takes up with Von Braun 's daughter Natacha ( Anna Karina ) . Casually killing his way through the glassy , nocturnal city , which has such place names as Heisenberg Avenue and Mathematics Park , he quickly exhausts his vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Godard insists , suggests , bleats , hints , reiterates , elaborates , declares and whispers that the machine is dehumanizing man-a message that seems somewhat familiar . All he offers for relief from this sermon is cinematic hark-backs to other movies , presumably entertaining to **35;179;TOOLONG cognoscenti . From time to time the optic nerves are assaulted by glaring lights , sudden switches to film-negative images , and frames of pop art irrelevance spliced into the action . It is such a long way to the final fade , in which Natacha masters the forbidden word- " love , " naturally-that moviegoers may feel they have been numbed by one of Alphaville 's own devices for eliminating undesirables : a theater where audiences are electrocuted in their seats . <P>
