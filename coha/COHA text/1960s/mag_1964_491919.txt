On the hot September morning when word came over the Venezuelan radio that a woman of Zulia state had given birth to five sons at once , the citizens of Maracaibo began , in the joyous Spanish phrase , to throw the house out the window . In the vast waterfront market , where battered piraguas bring their cargoes of fruit and fish , and dusty trucks from the foothills of the Andes unload , the air rang with shouts of jubilation . Porters trundling great loads of cassava and bananas laid them down . Vendors ran from their stalls . All clustered around men with transistor radios , who shouted the news as each bulletin came from University Hospital . " The quintuplets are actually here , at this moment . It is no joke . . ? The mother , a woman of Lagunillas , is doing well . . . . All are boys . " ( Cheers and CR ' shouts : " But naturally . Nothing else is possible . They are Muraeuchos . " ) " It was , " an observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man in the market had himself fathered the quintuplets . " The newspapers were ecstatic . " ANOTHER ZULIA lk RECORD , " blared the headline in Panorama . The paper exulted : " At the moment they arrived it was as if the star of Bethlehem paused above her bed . " While the citizens were romping in the streets , a more restrained group was meeting at the University Hospital . Present were the governor of Zulia , the director of the state department of health , and civic leaders . Also on hand was Dr. Robinson Suarez Herrera , who had attended Mrs. hies Maria Cuervo through the last days of her pregnancy and supervised the delivery . Beside him was the man on whom the burden now rested . Dr. Reguio Pachano Aries , chief of pediatrics at University Hospital , bore the responsibility for five babies who had come two months early . And in Venezuela , one out of four premature babies dies before its first birthday ; in this multiple birth , the danger was multiplied by five . Presiding was Dr. Pedro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his small moustache . " Gentlemen , " Dr. Calles Pulgar said quietly , " the question is simply this : ' What are we going to do ? ' " There was silence . The laymen present foresaw few problems , but the medical men soon shook their calm . The doctors outlined the complexities that would surround the rearing of the world 's only all-male quintuplets , and gradually a plan evolved to set up a foundation for their care and support . The Fundacien Quintuples Venezolanos  --  F5V for short  --  was formed to raise funds . ( It will gratefully accept contributions for the support of the 1 rieto children sent to them at Edificio lcuma . Local #8 , Avenida 5 de Julio , Maracaibo , Venezuela . ) Money would be provided to house the family and see to their medical and educational needs . By raising additional funds , the foundation would support Venezuela 's poor or neglected children . But a severe shock to national pride came a week after the quintuplets ' birth . On September 14 the Fischer quintuplets were born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who do not like to stay behind in anything , have had quintuplets too , " moaned the magazine Para Elias . " We Venezuelans were not given time fully to savor the fruits of our colossal success . But one great distinction still remains ours alone : The Venezuelan quintuplets are all boys . " first met Efren Prieto , the man who was to become the father of my five sons , at a family get-together about three years ago . He was , in a sense , a kinsman of mine , but not by blood . It came about in this way : His father , after having Efren by another woman , became the first husband of my mother , by whom ha had two daughters . Thus my older half sisters , Ida and Iria , were also half sisters of the man who became my husband . It would be romantic to say that we felt love for each other at the very moment we met , but this was not the case . I did not love him then , though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong hands and arms and shoulders that men develop when they work for many years with heavy tools around the oil derricks . He also was quick to smile , and his teeth were very white , and he had many friends . He also had many children , and money troubles with his wife . He had had two children by his first woman , and he was giving money for their support . He had eight more children by the wife he had when 1 met him , whom he had recently married after their sixth child was born . I , too , had five children of my own , though at the time I met Efren , I had no man . I had left school at 16 to be married to Marcel Duarte , a transporter of merchandise between the little oil towns on the eastern shore of Lake Maracaibo . This marriage had not been a happy one for me , for Marcel formed the habit of drinking aguardiente , and in 1955 it ended in divorce . I began to support my three daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an I.B.M . card puncher inthe offices of the Shell Oil Company . It was here that I met Candelario Farfa . He was a contractor , a welder of pipelines and a man of some wealth . We formed an association which lasted four years , and when our first son , Alexis , was born , Candelario bought me a little house where we lived until 1959 . In this year , when I was pregnant with our son Irwin , Candelario left me . He was , I discovered , not devoted seriously to me . It was not necessary for me to work while living with Candelario , but when he left me , I went back to work as a part-time schoolteacher  --  though I myself had only six years of school  --  and as a seller of cosmetics from house to house . Late in 1962 , while living alone and working to support my children , I resumed my acquaintance with Efren , whom I had met at the family party . He told me that he was very sad  --  he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him 1 , too , was unhappy , for I had no man . 1 began to cook for him and to give him consolation , but at first we did not live together , for he did not wish to live with me in the house that Candelaria had given me . In January of this year , therefore , we moved together into a little house on Q Road , outside the town of Ciudad Ojeda . It was a small house with only three rooms , but it had lights and running water and an inside toilet . We were not crowded there , for my children now were only four in number : Iris , Edalina , Alexis and Irwin . My oldest daughter , Josefina , had married at 16 and was living with her man , and Efren 's own 10 childrenremained at home with their mothers . Two months after we had moved into the little house , I realized that I myself again was to become a mother . The discovery did not upset me , though I by now was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josefina had borne a daughter whom she named Jeanette . I had always had my babies easily , for I come of strong and healthy stock . My grandmother Abigail had I I children , and today at 97 she is merry and bright and in good health of mind and body , except for her near-blindness . My mother , ConcepciOn , had 12 children , 10 of whom are still alive , and she today is healthy and strong . The coming of my own babies had caused me no distress . The coma ( trona , the midwife , came when the hour was at hand , and in my own bed , with no other help but hers , the babies were born . The pain was great , but it was quickly over , and soon 1 was back washing and cooking and keeping house for my man . Beginnings of worry Almost from the first , however , I knew there was something wrong this time , that this birth would not be easy as were those before . I was always hungry . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought terrible nausea . This had never been the case before . Also my belly began to swell at a rate that was unnatural . By the third month I was as big as a woman who is ready to give light to her baby . The neighbors would see me on the street and tease me . " Ines , " they would say , " you should have a little toycart to carry your big belly around in . " By the end of April I knew in my heart that this great swelling was no normal thing , that something was very wrong and strange . My energy was gone ; I had no strength to cook , to wash , to iron , to keep house . My feet and legs were swollen and painful , and my daughter Edalina kept the house while I stayed in my bed . After a while I could no longer bear the weariness and discomfort . I had to know what was happening to me . I went first to the doctor in Ciudad Ojeda . He examined me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date of my last period , he shook his head . " Madam , you are mistaken . " But how can a woman be mistaken about such things ? I remember very well the date ; it was January 27 . Still he would not believe me . " No , it can not be your third month . You are now in your sixth . Your baby will be born in July . " I went home , and for three months I grew more huge , more sick , more miserable , more afraid . Finally , gathering all my strength , I went to the house of a comadronu named Senora Araujo . She was a wise and experienced woman . She had had many children , and she had helped other women to have hundreds of babies . She did not examine me as doctors do , with instruments that cause pain . She merely felt my stomach with her fingers . " Ah , little daughter , " she said when she had finished . " There is something miraculous here . I can feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have more than one baby in your belly . Perhaps even more than two . I can- not help you . You must go to the clinic in Cabimas . There Dr. Juan Jose Perez Riera will take care of you . " I went home feeling the beginning of a great fear . Efren was at his job at an oil well far out in the lake . I said nothing to the children . The next morning , early , before Efren had come from his night of work , the comadrona came for me . There were many people waiting to see the doctors , for Cabimas is the biggest of the oil towns on the eastern shore , and the clinic is always busy . But I did not have to wait . The comadrona took me at once to Doctor Perez . Immediately he ordered an X ray . When the pictures were developed , a wave of great excitement ran through the clinic . Clearly , the doctor said , there could be seen five babies in my womb . Nurses and others had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting room to tell the people there . And the people in the waiting room , forgetting they were sick , ran into the streets to tell others . Soon a great crowd had come to see the woman who was to give light to five babies . And this was the beginning of all that has happened since  --  the reporters and the photographers and the curious people trying to enter the hospital to see me and my babies , and the letters and the telegrams coming from all over the world . When the doctor told me the news , I thought that I must faint . My body began to tremble , and I started to cry . The doctor was very gentle . He told me that the road back to my house was rough and would shake the babies . I must stay at the clinic from that moment , until further provision could be made for me . But I could not do this . My man , Efren , did not know that I had come to the clinic . He would come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disturbed . And for such news as this , I wanted to be the one to tell him . That night , when Efren came home , he was very hungry . But when he sat down to eat , and I told him , he could not eat . He looked at me bewildered , as a man stunned by a blow . " Yes , " I told him . " It is true . " He jumped up from the table . He began to strike his head with his hands . " No es posible , no es posible , " he said , beating his head . " No lo creo . " It is not possible . I do n't believe it . He rushed from the house , leaving his dinner uneaten . He went to the house of the comadrona to hear from her lips that I was making a joke . He came back , still looking stunned , but reconciled . " it is true , " he said . " When I went into her house , she congratulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be . " He went to bed . The next morning he drove me to the clinic in Cabimas in his little Fiat station wagon . He drove very carefully , " so as not to disturb the little birds in their nest . " He left me and went to his work . I remained in the clinic three days , while the arrangements were being made to receive me at the University Hospital in Maracaibo , and here were to begin all the happy events that were to follow  --  the gentleness of the nurses , the attention of the doctors , the good food , the rest and the quietness . There was one moment of unquietness . After the X rays had been developed , the news had been spread among the people of Cabimas . The newspaper Panorama in Maracaibo had a little story saying , " Zulia mother togive light to quintuplets " ( Zulia is a state lying along both sides of the northern shores of Lake Maracaibo ) . A television station in Caracas heard this news and demanded that I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital there . But I did not wish to go so far from home , where Efren and my children could not visit me . And I was glad when the doctors of Zulia said , " No , we are as well equipped to conduct this alumbramiento childbirth as are the doctors of Caracas . " On the third day the ambulance took me from the little clinic in Cabimas to the hospital in Maracaibo . It was a long trip of three hours , for the ambulance went very slowly . It was also a beautiful trip , for it led over the great new bridge that crosses the lake high above the water , where birds fly past the windows of the ambulance , and you can see the city far away and the big ships coming in from the sea to take on oil at the terminal at La Salina . I did not realize then that soon I and my children would be like the great bridge , a matter of pride and wonder to all Zulianos . It was only when the ambulance turned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had never been in so great a hospital before . Iliad had my babies at home in my own bed . With each there had been a moment of great pain . Could I bear the pain if it were multiplied five times , if it lasted five times as long ? Soon my fear began to diminish , for at the hospital all was gentleness and tranquillity . They took me up on the elevator on a stretcher to my room on the ninth floor . it was a beautiful room , airy , light and cool , and the high bed was soft beneath niy heavy body . Through the open window I could see far away to the residential area called Las Delicias , where there were many flowering trees , and on the streets the Guajiro women , the Indians , walked in their long , bright-colored dresses , like tiny dolls . In one corner of my room was a television , and by my bed was a telephone , and by my pillow a long cord with a button to push , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I arrived in the hospital on the second of August , and the button was to be pushed many times before my babies were to come on September 7 . With the rest , the good food , the kindness , the assurance of the doctors and nurses that all would be well with me , I soon began to feel greatly tranquil in my mind . But the burden I was bearing in my body often seemed more than I could endure . My belly was so huge that it seemed to extend around the sides to the backbone . I could not turn on my left side or my right . I could only lie on my back , looking up at the great mountain which rose just beyond my breasts . Within a week my swollen legs were normal . I began to feel strong again . But the babies were now kicking so hard I could not sleep . Sometimes they all seemed to kick at once in all directions  --  to the left , to the right , straight up and down . They never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others slept , two or three remained awake to kick . The nights were worst , and sometimes I could not keep from crying out in pain . The hospital was very kind . They put a bed in my room for my daughter Edalina , so that I would not become lonely and frightened in the night , and when the pain became too great , I would push the button , and the nurse would bring me medicine to make me sleep . Sometimes , too , the old fears would return , that at the moment of birth I would fail , that the children themselves might in some way be hurt . Then I would say a prayer to San Ram  --  n , the patron saint of pregnant women . And San RamOn would comfort me . So the days passed in pain and the easing of pain ; in fear and the soothing of fear . The Friday before the giving of light was a perfect day . I was calm . Even the babies seemed more quiet than usual . As night came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep . At eleven o'clock I waked up , feeling no discomfort other than the need to go to the bathroom . With Edalina helping me , I lifted my heavy body from the bed . I had gone perhaps three steps , when all at once I felt the breaking of the fountains . I turned at once back to my bed . " Quickly , Edalina , " I told my daughter . " Call Dr. Suarez Herrera at his home . The number is there by the telephone . " As she gave the number , I lay back on my bed . Faintly at first , then stronger but not yet strong , I felt the first contractions . There was but little pain . When Doctor Suarez answered , Edalina told him of the breaking of the waters and the beginning of my labor . " But that is not possible , " I heard him say . " It is too early yet . " Then there was a pause . " I will be over at once . " As I lay waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought of the doctors and all their well-laid plans . From what I had overheard , I knew they had wanted me to carry the babies as long as possible . Then they would take them by cesarean . But the babies did not know of the doctors ' plans . They . had chosen their own time to come . And the time was now . " Blessed San Ram6n , " I prayed . " May this be a happy event for me and my babies . May they all be horn alive and perfect in form . " I had hardly finished the prayer when Doctor Suarez came into the room . Quickly he examined me , patted me on the shoulder , and went out to see that the delivery room was made ready . Soon they came with the rolling bed , lifted me on it , and started down the hall to the elevator which would take me to the delivery room on the floor below . I looked up at the wall cluck . It was 20 minutes to twelve . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Valley . They were rolling me very slowly , and as we approached the elevator , 1 felt a stronger contraction , a sharper pain . Low down in my body I felt a great pressure , a great fullness . " Doctor , " I said , " I think the first one is coming now . It is ready to be horn " " .  - -  Igirciraese , oginitotere. - he said gently . Hold it , hold it . The phenomenal birth Once t was in the operating room wills everything in readiness , this first hasty little one seemed content to take his time . It seemed many minutes later when the hard contraction came , yet still with little pain . And then I saw the doctor lift him and heard his cry . Then there was another baby , and another very quickly without much pain , and the woman doctor who was there bent over me . " Please cry out , " she said , " so that we can know when another is coming . " But I felt no need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I could bear , even though I had received no anesthesia . The fourth baby was a little slow in coming , and one of the doctors seemed impatient . " Do not become impatient . " I told him . " It is there , and it will come . " It did , and I heard them say , " Another boy . " And finally the last one came , and I heard his cry , as I heard all the others , and it was all over . I was alive , and my live babies were alive . God and San RamOn had been good to me . I felt great happiness , great tranquillity . I felt like making a little joke . One of the doctors , who had been taking pictures of each birth , said , " Let 's wait a moment  --  there may be a sixth one . " " Perhaps there may be even seven , " I told him . They took me hack to my room then , where Edalina had been waiting at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went by in a nurse 's arms on his way to the incubator where he would Ike until he grew strong . As I passed the clock , I looked again at the lime . It is as 20 minutes until two Soon I was asleep , while down the hall in the nursery , with salt and oil and holy water , a priest baptised my babies m name of the Father , Son and Holy ' s while the doctors and their wives up as godparents for my boys . Their christening names were Robinson , Fernando , Juan Jost : , Otto , Mario  --  for the doctors who had been good to me . But to each was given the second name of RamOn , for the saint who cares for pregnant mothersand gises them happy births . The next day at three o'clock my man Efren arrived . He had worked all night on an oil well far in the lake , and he had heard the news only a few hours before by radio when he came ashore . He came in looking proud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coneratulated me . And two hours later , with two nurses standing as witnesses , we were married in my room by the civil judge Of C  --  alaUr  --  Lia:03 . Now Edalina has gone to stay with my sister , and on Friday night s Efren comes to sleep in a bed beside me until Monday morning . when he must start hack to the oil fields . And every so often we go down to the room where the babies are and look at them through the window . I watch them kick and push blindly with their arms , as they used to kick and push me before they came ' into the light . And I long to hold them in my arms and nurse t Iwns at my breasts . as I had nursed all my other children . This the doctors w ill not permit , and I. of course . am a little sad . But I do not complain . For I have given my husband live sons at once , %%Inch no woman in the world has seer done before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for me is happiness enough .
