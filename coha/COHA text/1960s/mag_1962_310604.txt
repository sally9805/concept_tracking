Not since the late Middle Ages has tapestry enjoyed such a surge of creativity . All over Europe looms are clacking busily as tapissiers. working elbow to elbow , ply the warp with bobbin and thread . In the ancient ateliers of Aubusson . 235 miles south of Paris , every loom is filled with work in progress ; Gobelin in Paris , once the royal tapestry house for the kings of France but more recently a manufacturer of furniture , has put weavers back to work on modern tapestries designed by some of France 's foremost artists . And in Lausanne , Switzerland , the first tapestry biennial exposition , sponsored by the International Center of Ancient and Modern Tapestry , has since June been attracting visitors from all over the world ( see color ) . <P> Carried into Battle . In the 14th and 15th centuries , tapestry was the supreme art of France . Rich in color , heroic in theme , and expensive to make , tapestries were the trappings of luxury . Yet they had a practical value . They dressed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept out the cold . Many a shivering demoiselle was grateful for chambres , movable partitions of tapestry which could subdivide a drafty great hall into a cozy nook . <P> Often tapestries , commissioned to show the exploits of a brave and royal person , were rolled up . carried into battle to decorate his tent . Later , in the 17th and 18th centuries , taste turned more and more to fixed wall decoration-marble , gilded woodwork , monumental paintings - and tapestry began to take a second place . Ironically , just as great technical advances were being made in the art of weaving , the spirit of originality began to disappear , and tapestry largely became a slavish imitation of paintings-often complete with their own ornate " gold " frames woven around their borders . With the exception of a few independent weavers working on their own , little worth while was loomed until recent years . <P> To Veil the Starkness . Tapestry 's new renaissance comes partly from a curiosity on the part of artists for new techniques , a new appreciation on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tapestry 's first muse , seems to be most responsible . Says Jean Lurgat , 70 , chairman of the International Tapestry Center and leader of the new movement in weaving : ' ' The modern world needs these large ornamental tapestries , these colorful hangings , to veil , and at the same time to enrich , the sometimes exaggerated starkness of bare walls in contemporary architecture . ' ' Lurgat is currently working on a series of tapestries called Le Chant du Monde , mostly representing such contemporary horrors as La Grande Menace ( fallout ) , Le Grand Charmer ( worldwide charnel house ) and La Fin de Tout ( final destruction ) . Other sections of Lurgat 's monumental looming have more pleasant themes : fishing , wine , the conquest of space , hunting and poetry . <P> Lurgat 's work is done at Aubusson on the river Creuse , the waters of which , unlike most other rivers in France , are free from calcium and perfect for dyeing wool . Dyeing sheds , with skeins of wool in every shade and color hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its banks . A more romantic reason for Aubusson 's destiny is the fact that it lay in the heart of the troubadour country during the days when chivalry was in flower and found its grand expression in tapestry .
