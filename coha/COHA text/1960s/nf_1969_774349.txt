Thus it happened that the excellence of a nation 's highway system helped make its conquest easy , as it had before , in other lands . Von Hagen , who explored Mexico and Central America , wrote in his book , The World of the Maya : " Apart from the famous Inca road system which they somewhat resemble , the Maya communications were the best in the hemisphere until the Lancaster Turnpike was opened in North America in 1792 . " The early Spanish in Yucatan reported finding traces of what had once been fine causeways between cities . Of these roads of the Maya , called sacbeob , von Hagen notes that they played a part in religion , akin to the " right of asylum " of roads leading to shrines and temples that was common in ancient Greece and prevailed in Rome in the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted , punishment was swift and severe for anyone who dared molest merchants on roads , and the royal highway system of the Inca was safe for any traveler even in hostile country . There was one other place in the New World where roads were found . In 1954 , when Rene de Laudonniere landed on the east coast of Florida near St. Augustine with reinforcements for Jean Ribaut 's colony of French Huguenots who were later massacred by the Spanish , his party found Indian villages of dome-shaped houses , enclosed with palisades , and noted that these villages , for reasons unknown , were approached by wide avenues , artificially graded , and several hundred yards in length . In 1885 , when Francis Parkman published the second and revised edition of his Pioneers of France in the New World , he wrote that " traces of these may still be seen . " His notebooks contain observations of the area from Beaufort , South Carolina , to Jacksonville and St. Augustine , Florida . About the Aztec roads in Mexico very little is known . Hernan Cortes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior . One of his associates wrote that " the way was rugged " into and through the mountains , but that when they reached the warm plateau they followed what he called " a royal road . " It is also known that the Aztecs had roads with couriers and cargo-carrying porters using them . But , as von Hagen said in The Aztec : Man and Tribe , " the wheel , except as used in children 's toys , was totally absent in Mexico . " In his 1726 edition of his Philosophic Experiments and Observations , Dr. Robert Hooke wrote that ignorance of the wheel in aboriginal America indicated that its inhabitants could not have come  | recently from Europe , Africa , or Asia , because " the wheel is an invention of so great use , that it seems impossible to be lost by mankind , after it be once known . " How , then , does one account for those wheels on toys ? It is history 's greatest paradox that America , where the wheel is now perhaps the one artifact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels only 500 years ago . " The employment of domestic animals distinguished the Peruvians from the other races of the new World , " said Prescott . " This economy of human labor by the substitution of the brute is an important element of civilization , inferior only to what is gained by the substitution of machinery for both . " The Peruvians ' domestic animals were those relatives of the camel , the llama and its wool-bearing relatives , the alpaca , the vicuna , and the guanaco . The llama was not a draft animal , but a burden-bearer . But the llama , said Prescott , could carry little more than a hundred pounds , which was not much more than human porters carried , and they could not travel very fast with burdens . Elsewhere in the New World , the burden-bearers were human , and astonishing feats were performed by those of the Aztecs . According to one of their own chronicles , their great calendar stone , a mass of dark porphyry weighing about 50 tons , was transported to the capital over some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great distance over broken country intersected by many water-courses and canals . Ten thousand men are said to have been employed in the task . During the journey , the great stone crushed a bridge and fell into the water . In Florida , according to Jacques le Moyne de Morgues , who accompanied Laudonniere 's relief expedition to Jean Ribaut 's colony , the Indians used hermaphrodites as porters . In pre-Columbian America there were no oxen , no cattle , no bovines other than the bison of the plains and the mountain sheep . There were no domesticated pigs or goats . The pig reached North America when Hernando de Soto 's expedition put ashore on Florida 's west coast . The horse was brought to America by the Spanish when the Cortes expedition to Mexico in 1519 brought to the mainland from Cuba eleven stallions and five mares . More soon followed . The Spanish also brought carts , cattle , donkeys , and mules . They were quick to grab land after the conquest of Mexico and establish haciendas , which were ranches for the breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , although Coronado 's expedition set out only 20 years after Cortes landed , there were already then so many horses and mules available in Mexico that he had no trouble assembling some 1500 head . The Spaniards in Mexico raised so many horses that , within a few years after the landing of those first creatures , the common run of horses had no value at all . " Whole herds had to be destroyed in order to leave grass for the remainder , " said Frank Dobie . From the escaped animals from such ranches , and not from the horses landed in Florida by De Sota as is often claimed , Mexico and the western plains of the United States were stocked with the mustangs that wrought such great changes in the lives of the Indians of the plains . From the same sources , the West got its burros and wild cattle . One of the factors in the Spanish conquest of the Indians was the natives ' fear and awe of horses . At Tlascala , in one battle , the Aztecs rejoiced because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80,000 Indians the main effort of the Indians seemed to be directed toward capture of a cavalryman whom they appeared to believe to be with his horse a single creature . The Mexicans thought rider and horse were one terrible animal and a supernatural being at that . So did many Peruvians . Prescott , translating one of the eye-witness reports of the Pizarro expedition , wrote : " It might have gone hard for the Spaniards . . . but for a ludicrous accident . . . happening to one of the cavaliers . This was a fall from his horse , which so astonished the barbarians , who were not prepared for this division of what seemed one and the same being into two , that , filled with consternation , they fell back , and left a way open for the Christians to regain their vessels ! " Since the chief aim of the Spanish in the New World was extraction of mineral wealth , they got roads of a sort built from mine site to seaports ; but such roads were mostly trails for pack-mules , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did his work . There was not much need for better roads . The reason was the same as that which enabled Europe to get along without roads for many centuries after the arrival of good horses from Spain , Barbary and Arabia , and the good tack ( saddles and stirrups ) of the Saracens and the Mongols . Of all the Europeans who came to the New World , the French had the best opportunity to make most of North America theirs . They found the best " highway " into the interior : that vast network of watercourses , with connecting portages ? the Saint Lawrence  | River , the Great Lakes , and the Mississippi River and its tributaries . This was the " highway " of the natives , whom the French , almost alone among the newcomers , treated with respect . The " vehicles " of the French were also those of the natives : canoes , both the light ones of birch bark for fast passenger-transport , and the larger freightcarriers which the Indians and the French jointly developed for the fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dog-team . The first Frenchman known to have sailed up the river now called the St. Lawrence recognized almost immediately the importance of the " road " into the North American interior . According to H.P. Biggar , in The Voyages of Jacques Cartier , it was Cartier , the mastermariner of St. Malo , who called the river " le grand fleuve de Hochelaga et chemin du Canada , " i.e. , " the great river of Montreal and road of Canada . " ' In the summer of 1534 , Cartier explored " the Great Bay , " as French fishermen called both Gulf and River , without finding that " road , " although he had seen the bay narrow from 300 miles to 20 , and had had to contend with its powerful current . It was Cartier , too , who set a precedent by encouraging two Indians , of the HuronIroquois group , to go back with him to France and learn French . That winter , in Paris , they told him they would gladly guide him up the river past the kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own kingdom of Hochelaga ( Montreal ) . So , in the summer of 1535 , he had competent guides when he sailed again , and this time went up-stream until the rapids stopped him . And , as F. Mason Wade wrote in The French Canadians : 1760-1945 , " from the summit of Mount Royal , he looked out over the great plain and saw the continental waterway stretching far beyond the rapids . " Those rapids , known to the French at first as Sault Saint-Louis , were later called Lachine in raillery of those who thought they could reach China by this route . One of the greatest of the voyageurs who sought out and found the first " roads " of North America was Samuel de Champlain , founder of New France and , therefore , founder of Canada . Fortunately for us , he was so capable in so many ways that he not only left good records of his wanderings but illustrated his writings with line drawings and water colors . For his first trip to the New World , he had gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virgin Islands , Puerto Rico , Cuba and Mexico . He crossed the Isthmus of Panama , saw the Pacific , and set down his opinion that a canal there would save many miles of sailing to the Orient .  | This trip by Champlain to Spanish America was important , not only to him , but to the shaping of the history of North America . At Guadeloupe , he saw his first Indians , and observed in his journal that they fled when they saw the Spaniards . This confirmed what he undoubtedly had already learned about the sordid record of Spanish cruelty . His own policy of kindness to the natives made it possible for the French to blaze trails far into the interior of North America , even before the landing of the Pilgrims , although there were probably never more than a hundred French in America at any time in Champlain 's lifetime . Champlain began his trailblazing in May of 1603 . Over the next five years , with interruptions to return to France to mend his political fences , he did thorough explorations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other waterways to the north , south and west ; and explored the coast of what is now New England . On his first visit , he explored the fiord-like Saguenay where it slices through a dark gorge to the St. Lawrence ; and , from Indian guides , learned that it was part of a canoe-route with a portage that led to a westward-flowing stream that flowed into a great body of salt water . The Northwest Passage to the Pacific ? No , he did not delude himself . In his notes he says , " I hold that . . . it is some gulf of this our sea which overflows in the north into the midst of the continent . " This was a remarkably accurate guess . In The Explorers of North America : 1492-1906 , John Bartlett Brebner said : " Thus the SaguenayMistassini traverse from the St. Lawrence to James Bay was recorded 70 years before any European followed it , and Hudson Bay was correctly imagined seven years before Henry Hudson found it . " Perhaps because he was basically such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Indian guides about a waterway that led from the Bay of Quinte on the north shore of Lake Ontario , then by way of the Trent River , Lake Simcoe and the Severn River to Georgian Bay . And , another by way of the Ottawa River to Lake Nipissing and down the French River to Georgian Bay . The latter was destined to be for more than 200 years the main " highway " of the French to the west . Champlain was shown some copper bracelets , and was told that " the good Iroquois " ( Hurons ) who lived along these " roads " knew of a copper mine far to the north . This was , of course , a reference to the copper later found , on the south shore of Lake Superior by French Jesuit missionaries in the 1700s and rediscovered by Americans in the 1840s . Voyaging up the St. Lawrence , he learned of the " road " up the St. Maurice to the northern tributaries of the Ottawa . Exploring what is now the Richelieu River , he learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which now bears his name ) ; then another lake ( Lake George ) ; then a short portage to a river which , he wrote , " leads down to the coast of Florida . " The river was the Hudson ; " Florida " then meant the Atlantic Coast south of the Bay of Fundy . As to the importance of that " road , " consider the number of battles that raged up and down it , especially at such strongpoints as Forts Ticonderoga and George .  | The trouble was that this handy road to the sea ran through the homeland of the belligerent Iroquois ; so Champlain and his guides turned around and went further up the St. Lawrence to that point where the rapids stopped them . There he learned of the portage paths around the rapids and of two great fresh-water seas divided by a waterfall , and beyond them , according to hearsay , more and even greater bodies of sweet water . There , too , he learned something even more important . Of the rapids , he wrote : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoes of the savages , which a man can easily carry . With . . . canoes . . . one may travel freely and quickly throughout the country ... " " This wistful inspiration of 1603 , " said Brebner , " was to be the seed of the French successes in exploring North America . " In other words , Champlain was first to realize that transport was the key to the continent , however far it might extend westward ; that the " roads " were the rivers and lakes and portages ; and that the " vehicle " was this Indian invention , the canoe . In recognizing the importance of this system of " roads , " and , in adopting the " vehicles " designed for the system , the French won control of the interior of the continent , from the Appalachians to the Rockies , and from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic , while other Europeans north of Spanish America were huddled in small colonies on the Atlantic seashore . Had their central government in France not been so stupidly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Champlain could not make a significant move without " clearing it with headquarters , " the land surely would have remained theirs , for they had most of it for almost 200 years , and held it for those two centuries with precious few Frenchmen . An example of pigheadedness in Paris occurred after Champlain had turned east in search of more " roads " into the New World . On the first of these quests , he set out in a pinnace with 12 sailors and two Indian ambassador-guides to survey and chart the coast of what is now New England . Champlain , according to his notes , was seeking roads into the interior ; and to that end , he probed all the bays and  | rivers of that coast . He found the pleasant spot which they called Mount Desert Island , a name that it still carries , but which is more familiar as Bar Harbor . On his following voyage , he sailed farther down the coast ( to Nauset Harbor ) , and wanted to resume there the next time ; but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , it was late summer when they sailed again around Cape Cod and saw an island in the west . A high wind from the west drove them back . " This was the farthest south and west that the Frenchmen came , " Morris Bishop wrote in Champlain : The Life of Fortitude . " Had they started earlier in the season , had the winds favored them , they would certainly have found Narragansett Bay , the Connecticut shore , the harbor of New York . We can hardly question that among the cordial Cuttyhunk Indians or the Manhattans of New York they would have found sufficient security for a settlement . And all our history would have been altered . Perhaps I would be writing this story in French . " One wonders what Champlain might have done had he reached the Connecticut River , or the Hudson . In July , 1608 , he founded the city of Quebec , now the oldest continuously occupied settlement north of Spanish America . He had French boys living with the Indians , learning their language and customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to live with the Huron chief . A Huron lad , whom the French called Savignon , was sent to the French in exchange , and went to school in Quebec . This was the beginning of the coureurs de bois ? the system that brought the probing , by the French , of the " outer space " of the continent . Few of the names of these trailblazers are known . We know that five years before the Pilgrims landed Brule had found a " road " south from Huronia ( Ontario ) across Lakes Erie and Ontario to the Susquehanna and down to Chesapeake Bay . Jean Nicolet , another of Champlain 's boys , was so sure he was on the road to Cathay that he carried in his canoe a richly embroidered ceremonial robe . He followed " the Old French Road " ( the Ottawa River , Lake Nipissing , French River , Georgian Bay , and Mackinac ) along the north and west shores of Lake Michigan into Green Bay , which he discovered in 1634 . He delighted the Indians with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisconsin River " road " to the Mississippi . That was the road that Louis Joliet and Father Jacques Marquette took on their voyage to the Mississippi in 1673 . Their reasoning that this waterway was flowing too directly south to be a route to the Pacific was confirmed by Robert Cavelier , Sieur de la Salle , who  | sailed to the Gulf in 1682 and , in honor of Louis XIV , gave the name , Louisiana , to the French interior of North America . But by then Champlain , the visionary trailblazer , was dead . On Christmas Day of 1635 , peacefully in his bed in the governor 's chamber in the fort overlooking the St. Lawrence , he became " Monsieur de Champlain d'heurese memoire . " They roved far , those intrepid successors of his , some of whom he trained personally , and others inspired by his writings and reputation . They reached the Rockies before the English found passes through the Appalachians . They knew the country north of Lake Superior and around the coast of Hudson Bay . They knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they called it ) , and they knew all its tributaries and the portages by which one could reach it from Lakes Ontario and Erie . It was the men of the coureurs de bois who made it possible for American colonists on the Atlantic littoral to find their way through the Appalachians into the west . These forgotten men , seldom mentioned by historians , blazed the trails and pointed out the paths that later became the roads of the United States and Canada . Unlike the French , who found in the St. Lawrence and Mississippi waterways the two best roads into the interior of North America , those who tried to establish settlements along the Atlantic coast between the Spanish and French holdings faced problems of transport and communication that were not only peculiar to the areas but were so formidable that , once you understand their complexity , you marvel that they were ever solved . We can not understand fully the nature , size or dimensions of those problems , but we need to try . Unless we do so , we are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we are likely to wonder why it took 150 years to push 150 miles into the wilderness . Understanding does not come easily . Part of the trouble is the illusory foreshortening which manages to make the two centuries between America 's discovery and the birth of the United States seem shorter than the span between our nation 's birth and the present moment . As Dale Van Every noted in Our Country Then , all the world is familiar with the story of the American frontier in terms of the Far West as it has been conventionalized by miles and miles of film , countless hours of radio and television time , and tons and tons of fiction .  | But there was an earlier frontier , far more difficult for its frontiersmen than the well-publicized , more recent one . It " was an era , not an area , " Van Every said ; " it was distinct in time , not space . " The facts about those earlier frontiersmen who began to come to our land from the Old World almost 400 years ago have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize how watery it is , we are likely to find ourselves awash in it . There was , first of all , the shore on which those invaders landed . From Cape Cod northward , that shore was forbidding , mostly rockbound , with many hidden shoals . Take , for example , the coast of Maine which compresses a serrated coastline of 2,500 miles , and more than 400 offshore islands , into an airline distance of only 225 miles . So frail were the ships and so inadequate the navigation of the Pilgrims that , aiming for the area around Chesapeake and Delaware Bays , they landed at Cape Cod instead . " They could scarcely have picked out a worse spot for a settlement had they searched from the Penobscot to the Hudson River , " said A. Hyatt Verrill in Along New England Shores . " The country was hilly , sandy , sterile , and mainly pine barrens . Between the sandhills were stagnant pools and sluggish streams , while high tides , heavy rains or melting snow flooded the lowland . It was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why the leaders of the expedition should have selected it is a mystery . " The best harbors and the best waterways into the interior occur below Cape Cod and , going westward into Long Island Sound , Narragansett Bay , then the mouths of the Thames and Connecticut Rivers , and then that magnificent harbor at the mouth of the Hudson . As you study the map , however , you note that these roads give access to the interior not westward but northward , and that anyone bold enough to try to reach their sources then was bound to approach territory guarded by the French and their numerous Indian allies . Farther south are those sheltered ways , the rivers that empty into Delaware and Chesapeake Bays ; but , there too , the main waterways , such as the Delaware and Susquehanna , run from north to south . The melodiously-named Susquehanna , you remember , was part of the road that Champlain 's young trailblazer , Etienne Brule , took to reach Chesapeake Bay from Lake Huron several years before the landing of the Pilgrims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the York and the James is the flow more generally eastward . Here , at last , are waterways that can be navigated to the west . These facts of geography furnish the clue to the early settlers ' preference for this area .  | Still farther southward , would-be settlers faced the confusion of streams and swamps around Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds and then more southward-flowing streams until the Santee and the Savannah , with several fine sheltered bays between those two rivers . But , in addition to climatic conditions that were unfamiliar to people from northern Europe , the Carolina and Georgia coasts were then uncomfortably close to Spanish holdings . Along this stretch of shore , hopeful people began landing near the end of the 1500s . Penetration of the land was mostly confined to waterways . Generations of settlers lived and died without the faintest notion of the vast breadth of the continent . Those who were curious about the matter , learned that beyond the mountains were still more mountains . So , for 200 years , most of them lived and died on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept them close to shore . There was the forest . It was friend and enemy . As friend , it gave houses , fuel and ships ; it added lumbering and woodworking to such early industrial activities as fishing , ship-building and sailing . To cope with it , early Americans had to invent the curved and balanced axe-handle , the first major improvement on the axe since primitive man fitted a piece of sharpened metal onto a wooden shaft . Without that improved axe , early road-making would have been more difficult . But as enemy , that forest was sinister . Letters and reports of soldiers who saw service in America show that they found nothing more disturbing than the prevalent lack of visibility . " Nowhere can one see 20 yards , " wrote one . It was a place where the brightest day was but a dilution of black night . " Like campaigning in a sack , " was another soldier 's verdict . The nature of that barrier of mountain and forest may be gauged by the fact that , 150 years after those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 miles west of Albany , 75 miles west of Philadelphia , and 55 miles west of Savannah . As Dale Van Every put it in Forth to the Wilderness , " The region beyond , extending endlessly westward to a distance no man yet knew , was ... as mysterious as the face of another planet . " To the settlers who lived at the edge of that forest , it was a fearful daily reality , not only because of the unknown dangers that lurked in it , but because the great trees shut off the sunlight needed to grow crops and sustain life . As Stewart Holbrook wrote in Holy Old Mackinaw , " For two centuries . . . a man who would erect a sawmill and thus encourage the cutting of trees was not only a leading citizen but a beneficent and patriotic fellow as well . "  | In addition to the forest , there were the vast swamps , infested with insects that attacked in clouds , and this in an age when nothing was known of the relation between such insects and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so thoroughly have we lost touch with the realities of that time that we can now tolerate the most arrant imbecilities about " wanton destruction " of that forest and the draining of those swamps . Complicating the lives of those settlers was the fact that , by British royal edict , all pines 24 inches or more in diameter at the butt and standing within three miles of water were Crown property . In getting such toppled giants from forest to river and then to seaport , roads of a sort were made from settlements into the interior . Such was the setting in which , for two centuries , more and more people settled on the narrow continental strip between sea and mountains . Meantime , in the forested interior , the French , aided by Indians whom they befriended , roved from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico . During the 1630s and on into the 1650s , certain forces began shaping the economy of the new land , bringing about the first tentative inching westward and leading to the development of roads . These were ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) the flight of indentured persons from conditions of slavery , and ( 3 ) the " Great Elopement " from what is now Delaware . The earliest migration from one colony to another seems to have been instigated ( to his subsequent regret ) by the Dutch governor of Nieuw Amsterdam , who invited some Pilgrims to the valley of the Connecticut in 1627 . Later , Puritans of Massachusetts began to come there , moving through the wilderness over an old Indian trail that was to become famous as the Old Connecticut Path . It was not long before they were coming in ever greater numbers . The Dutch , having opened the dyke , finally had to retreat before the flood of humanity from the east . The summer of 1636 brought the famous migration of Pastor Thomas Hooker ; and , in the winter of that year , Roger Williams made his historic trip to the spot where Providence , Rhode Island was founded . In A History of Travel in America , Samuel Dunbar noted that , also in the 1630s , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haven , Milford and Guilford , Connecticut ; and parties of Dutch up the Hudson . The reasons for these migrations are obscure , but the late Dr. Perry Miller , professor of American literature at Harvard , suggested  | that " the people were land hungry . " Whatever their motive , their progressive dispersal over ever-widening areas proved the undoing of the scheme of the New England Puritans to establish in America a state in which the power of the church would be absolute . Primitive though they were , the early roads of New England played powerful parts in the failure of that scheme . As Puritan villages became thinned by the migrations , they were no longer self-sufficient , and had to look to the small colony of forerunning Pilgrims at Plymouth for grain and cattle . As prices for farm products soared , the Pilgrims became suddenly prosperous . Their response was to make clearings farther and farther from the village until , in due course , they left the village for the farm . In so doing , they lessened their ties with the religion-oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion , " the spread of the farm economy destroyed some villages , but at the same time , the consequent development of trade transformed many coastal villages into commercial cities . Wealth came to have vastly different meanings in the northern and southern colonies . In the north , the emerging men of wealth were the merchants , the brokers , the shippers , the traders , the shipbuilders , the shipowners , and later , the factory owners . In the south they were planters , landowners . The two widely diverse ways of life and concepts of wealth manifested themselves in the different ways in which networks of roads developed in the north and south . In the northern colonies , people tended to concentrate in and around trading centers , hamlets and villages that grew into commercial and industrial communities , each surrounded by farms linked to the trading centers by webs of trails that evolved into roads . In the southern colonies people tended to concentrate on the vast plantations , each a more or less self-sufficient unit , and the evolving network of trails and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction of the land-grant as lure for migrants to America brought in its train not only the succession of clashes between white men and red which culminated in the mid-1700s in the French and Indian Wars ; it brought also a form of slavery which , because it was temporary , has received less attention than has Negro bondage . This slavery was called indenture and it brought to America many penniless whites who came hoping to own land and who formed the vanguard of the movement of settlers away from the coastal communities and into the forested mountains . From their ranks came most of the frontiersmen . They blazed the first trails into the wilderness .  | Indenture was voluntary servitude , entered into by agreement , usually for a limited span but sometimes for life . Washington 's own great-grandfather is believed to have worked for his passage when he came to America in 1657 . Many other people , however , indented themselves as servants for a fixed term of years in payment for passage . Such indenture papers , between the person wishing to migrate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain of the ship carrying the indented person , and he in turn sold them to the highest bidders in the New World . This practice , naturally , led to abuses . Children were kidnapped and orphans were sold for years of bondage in the New World . Also , jails were emptied , and people convicted of crimes chose indenture rather than imprisonment . Debtors chose indenture rather than a term in debtor 's prison . True , many people thus improved their lot in life , but some were truly enslaved . As the number of colonies increased , it became progressively easier for an indented person to free himself by escaping to another colony , and there assuming a new identity . This was self-liberation by " hitting the road , " as was done by the serfs in the Middle Ages . The sectarian tolerance in Rhode Island , Maryland and Pennsylvania lured many refugees from other colonies ; indeed , that tolerance and the resultant migration from other colonies were largely responsible for the greater speed with which the frontier moved westward in Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest city in the colonies . The prevalence of such flight , of indentured servants liberating themselves and of people fleeing from Puritan tyranny , left its traces on old maps as such notations as " Ye road to ye woods " and " Street leading to ye woods . " Far more attention-getting than the ventures of the indented persons was the development in what is now Delaware , where a colony of Swedes and Finns had been established in 1638 under the guidance of that purchaser of Manhattan , Peter Minuit . On the site of what is now Wilmington , these newcomers built a fort after making a deal with five Indian chiefs ; and built the log cabins of which David Budlong Tyler said in The Bay and River Delaware : " This was the introduction of a type of structure admirably suited to frontier life , and one which became a symbol of democracy . " They named their community Christinehamn after the famous Gustavus Adolphus ' daughter , who succeeded him on the throne . Under Johna Printz , the community thrived . Keeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village that had mills , wharves and a  | boat-building works ; they made barrels and wove textiles , and they built trading posts along trails into the woods . But settlers began to drift away into the woods . The defections began as soon as the colony was founded , in the belief of George Stewart as set forth in his U.S. 40 ? Cross Section of the United States of America . He noted that , since these Baltic people , coming from heavily wooded lands , were better woodsmen than most other early settlers , they were not terrified by the wilderness but felt at home in it . Unlike the English , they knew how to turn the trees into snug and comfortable dwellings . Stewart reconstructed the forgotten past in reasonable terms . Said he : " When a Swedish soldier became disgusted or when a Finnish colonist fell into debt , or if either a Swede or a Finn got into trouble with the authorities , or even if he only got itchy feet , he was likely to take to the woods ' literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squatter and hunter . " The departures were sporadic and limited in the first few years . Then , into the Bay in 1655 sailed Peter Stuveysant with his war fleet . The colony had no choice but to surrender . And now , scarcely had the Dutch assumed control when " the Great Elopement " began . It had nothing to do with brides and grooms , unless perhaps coincidentally . It did , however , have much to do with American roads . To understand the term , one must remember that the English elope comes from the Anglo-French eloper , and that this word , as well as the English leap and lope derive from the Medieval Dutch open , meaning to run . And that is what so many settlers did . The causes for that alarming exodus were mixed : absence of any feeling of loyalty by the Swedes and Finns toward their Dutch Conquerors ; and then a series of misfortunes that included two extremely severe winters , a summer of crop failure , and an epidemic of some kind of fever ( borne by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of the colony deeply in debt . Almost overnight , the flight assumed such proportions that the frightened officials brought in additional troops to try to halt it . Soon , however , more than half of their armed force had joined the " elopement . " What made it particularly easy for the " elopers " was that , only a dozen miles away , they could escape Dutch jurisdiction by stepping over into Lord Baltimore 's colony of Maryland where , though technically interlopers , they were not unwelcome . Thus , said Stewart , " began the first migration westward along the line of U.S. 40 . " He assumed that , since the fugitives were so numerous , some sneaked back now and then to visit friends and relatives  | and get supplies , and that this two-way flow began the road through the woods . Before , during and after the " Great Elopement , " other migrations were in progress . Dunbar , admitting that his list was probably far from complete , noted that , in the 1640s , New Englanders established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Delaware River ; and on the Schuylkill . River . In the next decade , a party from Virginia , including some Quakers , migrated into North Carolina ; and New Englanders settled Jamaica , Long Island . In the 1660s , the migrations extended over greater distances ; New Englanders to North Carolina , and many people from Massachusetts , New Hampshire and Connecticut to New Jersey . Ten years later Dutch from New York were settling in the Carolinas , and in the 1680s large parties from virtually all the colonies converged in Delaware Bay to settle in the new colony of Pennsylvania and the well-planned town of Philadelphia . Simultaneously with these moves of large numbers of people in concerted migrations , there was an accelerated movement of individuals and families to new farms and new settlements near older ones . These migrations were called by Dunbar " the first manifestations of the restless desire for movement and change , the somewhere-else feeling , that has ever since been a characteristic of the native-born American . " Then in 1682 , when William Penn arrived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quakers and other oppressed persons exerted an almost magnetic pull on people in all the colonies . Before long , migrations between colonies , though still mainly by coastal waterways , were making trails along the coast which were the beginnings of many roads that are still in existence today . Throughout most of this period of people-in-motion , there was little need for road building , for most travel was by waterways . When there was need for inland travel , the colonists used the Indian trails , or " traces , " as they were called . Such traces were from 12 to 18 inches wide , and when they went through areas where there had been much Indian travel for a long time , they were often worn a foot deep . To assist travelers on these trails , colonial authorities began issuing orders that small streams be bridged by felling trees across them and that canoe ferries be established for the crossing of larger streams . Dunbar said that the earliest such ferries in New England were doubtless of the birch-bark variety , but that the slower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a few gestures toward establishment of roads . In Virginia , only 25 years after Jamestown 's founding , the House of Burgesses passed a law stipulating that each male in the colony should work on the roads a certain number of days each year , or pay someone else if he had no taste for the labor of cutting down trees or uprooting stumps . There is no evidence , however , that the law resulted in any roads worthy of the name . In 1639 , the Massachusetts General Court decreed that a road be built between Boston and Plymouth ; and , though work on it was soon begun , there was not yet in the area any travel by land vehicles . In Maine , the first white traders blazed trees along Indian trails between pioneer coastal communities , according to Herbert G. Jones ' thorough study , , King 's Highway from Portland to Kittery . But , Scarborough , Saco , Wells and Kittery had become busy towns long before Maine 's first road , called " Kennebunk-by-the-Sea , " was built in 1653 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kittery were ordered to make " straight and convenient pathways " along the coast " for man and horse . " Shortly afterward , Portland ( then known as Falmouth ) and Scarborough were ordered to make the road connecting them more passable . But , says Jones , such roads were merely staked out to definite widths ; that is , the trees may have been cut off and removed , but the roads were mere ruts winding around the great stumps . Maine communities were often rebuked and fined for not maintaining their roads . The best travel was in winter by sleigh . After 1700 the favored winter vehicles were the two-horse pung and the one-horse pod . In his novel Arundel , Kenneth Roberts provided a vivid picture of Maine travel when roads " were little better than a succession of bogholes with the horse perpetually slipping into the muck up to its withers . " In Maryland , the wording of the first road law , in 1666 , shows that it was intended to improve portages ; it ordered roads at the heads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was no mention of carts or wagons until a Maryland court order of 1690 . From his study of records in the area , George Stewart , concluded that though it may have been possible then to walk , ride horseback , take a pack-horse , or perhaps even a cart around the head of the Bay , from New Castle to Patapsco , with some sort of ferry service on rivers , that road was seemingly so unimportant that , when the first post route was established in 1690 , it went from Annapolis to Chester River , then north on the Eastern Shore , avoiding the head of the Bay entirely .  | The best of the colonial roads in the 17th century came into being quite without planning or intent ; and did so in Jamestown colony because , while backers of the enterprise in London were clamoring for some sign that gold had been found , the adventurers learned about the " gold on the ground . " This was that " kinde of weed , " which , one early visitor put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chew , " and sometimes light and burn it , too , " so that it giveth a fowle stinkeing smoak " that they draw into their mouths through long tubes " so that the smoak cometh out again by their mouth and nostryls in such wyse that you might thinke them devils out of helle instead of mortyll men . " Had it not been for the highly remunerative nature of the tobacco trade , there would have been little reason for roads in Jamestown colony , for a cavalier society had developed there . Fine horses and good horsemanship became important parts of the good life as it was cultivated and cherished in the plantation houses that sprang up along the pleasant waterways . From England , Virginians and Marylanders imported horse-racing , the sport of kings ? and fox hunting , the sport which Alexander Pope described as the pursuit of something not worth catching . However lowly their origins may have been in the Old World , here many colonists became ladies and gentlemen , dedicated to the proposition that , even in the wilderness , life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed no road . With good horse and tack , and with servants to fetch and carry , he could make do very well with a bridlepath . On it , he could travel in the saddle ; his lady could come along on side-saddle or pillion ; and baggage and freight could move on pack-animal or by human porter . But , there was tobacco . For transport by ship , it was packed into hogsheads made of heavy wooden planks , banded with straps of iron . Each loaded hogshead weighed from 800 to 1,000 pounds . Since there were no roads that would accommodate wheeled vehicles , the hogsheads were rolled to the waterfronts . For almost a century , no ports were needed , because all Tidewater plantations had their own wharves . As these big , heavy hogsheads bumped slowly along the red-clay they compacted the earth somewhat as a modern roller does , producing travelways which became known , from the purpose for which they were used , as " Rolling Roads . " Wider than pack-horse trails and bridle-paths , they became pounded hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of servants , black and white , working endlessly at the task of rolling the great hogsheads from the drying sheds to the wharves.  | By 1729 more than 300 ships were regularly crossing the sea with Tidewater tobacco for England ; and , as the plantations spread over the peninsulas between the rivers , the Rolling Roads had to be extended . Some followed old Indian trails that had been widened into bridle-paths , and their additional widening to accommodate the massive hogsheads necessitated cutting down trees and digging up stumps . But even then , the waterways were favored . As Val Hart wrote in The Story of American Roads , the idea of strapping Indian canoes together to serve as floats to bear tobacco to the wharves became very popular because ingenious means were devised to make such floats carry as many as 10 hogsheads at a time . Later , he said , the planters adopted the bateau , that larger craft developed by the French and Indians . It was not until the Piedmont country at the foot of the mountains began to be settled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxen , came into use . Dunbar 's voluminous history of American travel observed that the early immigrants left precious few descriptions of the methods and hardships of travel . We can have some notion of what those trails between habitations were like in the early 1700s because we have enough fragments of a private journal kept by an extraordinary woman who journeyed on horseback from Boston to New York and back in the fall and winter of 1704-05 . She was what was then called " a gentlewoman , " and was about 38 years old when she took her fearsome trip . Her name was Sarah Kemble Knight ; but , because she was a schoolteacher , she was known as Madam Knight . The Journal of Madam Knight presents what is perhaps the best picture of life on the road in America at that time . She had a sharp eye and a sharper tongue , a combination that has made what is left of her journal an unfailing delight for all readers who have had the good fortune to come across one or another of the several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madam Knight , the daughter of a Charlestown shopkeeper who moved to Boston , married the American agent for a London merchant . When her husband died , she seems to have had boarders or lodgers , one of whom was a young widow for whom Madam Knight found a second husband in July , 1704 . The groom was Madam Knight 's well-to-do cousin , Caleb Trowbridge of New Haven . Early that September , the bride was once more a widow , and three weeks later , Madam Knight was on her way to New Haven to help settle the estate . There she found that Thomas Trowbridge , her kinsman and the late Caleb 's father , had to go to New York before the matter  | of the inheritance could be closed , and she decided to accompany him there . During the journey she made a practice of setting down her daily observations every evening before she retired . The first version was published by Theodore Dwight in 1825 ; there have been several since . The introductions to several of these editions comment on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston to New York . In the 1825 edition , Theodpre Dwight wrote : " Over that tract of country where she traveled about a fortnight on horseback under the direction of a hired guide , with frequent risks of life and limb , and sometimes without food or shelter for many miles , we proceed at our ease , without exposure and almost without fatigue , through a well-peopled land , supplied with good stagecoaches and public houses , or the still greater luxuries of the elegant steam boats which daily traverse our waters . " In the intervening 120 years , the duration of the journey had been reduced from a fortnight to a day-and-a-half . In an edition published in 1865 , the editor noted that the " time is now reduced to eight hours " and added that he thought " the speed of travel will never be carried to a much higher degree . " Madam Knight 's Journal begins : " Monday , Octb'r. ye second , 1704 . About three o'clock afternoon I begun my Journey from Boston to New-Haven ; being about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waited on me as farr as Dedham , where I was to meet ye Western post . " In Dedham she waited in vain until evening for the post-rider and then decided to go on 12 miles farther to the home of Mrs. Billings where , she said , the post-rider " used to lodg . " The son of a tavern owner was prevailed upon to accompany her . For her journey she wore " a little round cap of Lincoln green , a petticoat of green drugget cloth with puffed and ruffled sleeves , highheeled leather shoes with green ribbon bows , and a riding mask of black velvet . " W. E. Woodward , in The Way Our People Lived , suggested that the mask was worn to protect her face from the sun , " so that her skin would keep its fashionable pallor . " But it was autumn , and as much of the way was through the woods , the mask was undoubtedly protection against cold and the whipping action of twigs and branches . " When we had Ridd about an how'r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reason of a great fogg , very much startled mee , it being now very Dark . But nothing dismay 's John : Hee had encountered a thousand and a thousand such Swamps , having a Uni- versall Knowledge in the woods ; and readily Answered all my inquiries wch. were not a few . " At 8 in the morning of October 3 , she was off with the post ; and at two in the afternoon they met the Western post and exchanged letters . They also stopped there to eat . One might get indigestion from the description of the fare were it not for her witty commentary , such as " what cabbage I swallowed serv 'd me for a Cudd the whole day after . " Her third guide that day rode very hard , she said , and , after crossing Prividence Ferry they came to a river " wch they Generally Ride Thro ' . But I dare not venture ; so the Post got a Ladd and a Cannoo to carry me to tother side , and hee rid thro ' and led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says she did not dare even to move her tongue . Again mounting her horse , she found the road very pleasant but enjoyed it less when the post-rider told her that , though it was near sunset , they had 14 miles to go , and that another river , narrow but very fast , had to be forded . She conveys to her narrative much of the terror that assailed her in this ride through the forest in the blackest of night . After the harrowing ride through the stream into what the rider told her was Narragansett country , the path narrowed and " on each side the Trees and bushes gave us very unpleasant welcomes with their Branches . . . " There was the reason for that mask . Finally , the moon came out from behind clouds and Madam Knight was so relieved of her terror that she composed a poem in celebration of this light . When they had arrived at the stage where they were to lodge , she was received warmly but , after being put to bed , she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Town topers in next room . " At four next morning she set out again , this time with a French doctor in the company . That day , she reported , the road was poorly furnished with accommodations for man or beast . " We were forced to ride 22 miles by the post 's account , but neerer thirty by mine , before we could bait ( feed ) so much as our Horses . " They came eventually to an inn , but found it intolerably bad and rode on to an ordinary about two miles farther on . About one in the afternoon they came to a river , raging in flood , and , her courage failing her , she parted company with the post and the doctor , and sought lodging in a cottage by the river . The old man who lived there told her that she was welcome to stop with his family until the flood subsided and he could help her over the stream . She was , however , taken across by the old man 's son-in-law , whom she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance , she crossed the stream and was conducted to Stonington , " where the Rode was very Stony and uneven . "  | She was welcomed at the home of the minister , " the Reverend Mr. Gurdon Saltonstall , the most affable , courteous , Generous and best of men . " Next day the minister found her a guide for the journey to New Haven . Said she : " The Rodes all along this way are very bad , Incumbred with Rocks and mountainos passages , wch were very disagreeable to my tired carcass . " Her horse stumbled in crossing a bridge and threw her , but " through God 's Goodness I met with no harm , and mounting agen , in about half a miles Rideing , came to an ordinary , " where , she adds , they were well entertained . After that narrow escape from a plunge into a river , she perhaps needed that drink . At the next stop , the landlady was a slattern , and the food was inedible . Madam Knight says she paid sixpence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By riding long hours every day , Madam Knight had been able to leave Boston on Monday and reach New Haven the following Saturday . On December 6 , " being by this time well Recruited and rested after my Journy , " she decided to accompany her kinsman to New York . Noted enroute were food at Stratford ferry too awful for human to eat ; a " dinner of Fryed Venison , very savoury , " at Norwalk at noon ; the need to walk and lead their horses " up a prodigious high Hill " approaching Rye ; and , at Rye , French cuisine which she did not like , so she went supperless to bed . They set out at three in the morning , and " about seven in the morn come to New Rochell a French town , where we had a good breakfast . And in the strength of that about an how'r before sunsett got to York . " It took her two days . New York she found such a well-ordered and clean city that she left " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the afternoon . They hoped to reach New Rochelle but got lost and , after wandering in a snowstorm , spent the night uncomfortably in a cottage . Roads and bridges were good until they " took leave of York Government . " Near Stamford they encountered bridges that were high and tottering . About nine that night they reached Norwalk , " having crept over a timber of a Broken Bridge about thirty foot long , and perhaps fifty to ye water . " There she spent " the most perplexed night I have yet had . " In the face of more discomforts , Madam Knight reached New Haven on the 24th . She remained there for several weeks , settling the business that had made her undertake this journey , and she left in February . At New London she tarried to visit friends and to have supper with Governor Winthrop . On the road three days later , she had a terrifying experience when , reaching a stream that was in flood , she  | had to cross in a canoe . The man who conveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetch the horses and the luggage . This he did by piling the baggage in the frail craft and making the horses swim after it . " It is past my skill to express the Exceeding fright all their transactions formed in me , " she wrote , adding that they were now in Massachusetts . On the final stretch of her journey , after traversing a road which a thaw had turned into a muddy slough , she and her companions were going over a causeway at Dedham when she and her mount were almost washed away by the raging waters that overflowed it . According to tradition , this redoubtable Boston schoolmarm had , among a number of pupils who were subsequently notable in the colonies , that versatile American , Benjamin Franklin . If there is anything to tradition , it seems especially appropriate that , years later , this particular pupil of hers should have done so much to make a passable highway of that series of more or less connected paths whose perils she braved at the beginning of the 18th century . Disorganization is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic coast at the time when Franklin grew into maturity . Communication was primitive . " News " was rumor fetched by the rare traveler and distorted beyond recognition by the rum-pot arguments in the inns , the taverns , the ordinaries . Each center of population was more or less self-sufficient , and each was as remote from ' its neighbor as the several colonies were distant from one another . With his genius for organization , it was natural that Franklin should entertain the idea of organizing the several colonies into some kind of union . It was this idea that motivated his proposal in May , 1743 , that an American Philosophical Society be formed , with members in all of the colonies . He also sought better communication , an end to the isolation that was keeping Americans apart . In 1748 , though only 42 , Franklin retired to a 300-acre farm near Burlington , New jersey , to " indulge myself in that kind of life which was most agreeable , " a 's he wrote to Jared Eliot , a **25;1465;TOOLONG in Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the colonial postoffice . Then , in 1753 , the officials of the British post office appointed Franklin and William Hunter , publisher of the Virginia Gazette and postmaster at Williamsburg , to be jointly " Deputy Postmaster and Manager of all His Majesty 's Provinces and  | Dominions on the Continent of North America . " Hunter fell ill , and more and more of the work fell on Franklin 's shoulders . Within a year after his appointment , Franklin had so improved service northward from Philadelphia that a letter could go to Boston and an answer could be had in three weeks . In 1754 he visited every postoffice in the northern colonies . During 1755 and 1756 he made a similar round of visits in Maryland and Virginia . He not only met postmasters and systematized their accounts but surveyed and selected the roads , the fords and the ferries that were best for the service . Within eight years , Franklin and Hunter were able to remit to London the first profits that the colonial postal system had ever made . He established many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's postal system ; but of greatest importance was the sense of unity that he managed to instill in the individual postmasters and in the mail carriers who rode the roads and trails between Maine and South Carolina . Under Franklin 's leadership and exhortations , the mails , for the first time , were made to move night and day between New York and Philadelphia , and such service was later extended to Boston . In 1763 , he took again to the roads , first in the south , then north through Maryland , Delaware , Pennsylvania , New Jersey and New York , measuring , charting , and marking with milestones the series of trails that became the famous Boston Post Road and much later became an important part of U.S. 1 from the Maine-Quebec border to Key West , Florida . Until about the mid-1950 's , it was still possible to find along that old Boston Post Road an occasional milestone that had been placed there at Franklin 's order ; but , sad to relate , most have now disappeared . Though it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin was , quite obviously , a good road-maker . A year after his arduous trip along those primitive trails , the first attempt at rapid overland transport was made in the colonies ; crude four-horse stage coaches began to make scheduled runs between Philadelphia and what is now Jersey City . They made two trips each way every week . By hard driving , and by changing horses at stages , they made the 90-mile run in two days . They were called " Flying Machines . " There was beginning to take shape the network of roads which Franklin believed vitally necessary for that American unity to which he was to devote the rest of his long and useful life .  | There is a melodious sound to the names of some of our early roads : the Iroquois Trail , along the Hudson and then to Niagara , through the area ruled by Johnson of the Mohawks ; the old Connecticut Path ; the Kittaning Path from Philadelphia over the mountains ; the Scioto-Monongahela Trail in Ohio ; and that later road for the great western migration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first century would show many such paths spreading out like spider webs from all New England communities ; but , with the exception of sleds in winter , there was little vehicular traffic on them . I.1 his celebrated classic , The Frontier in American History , Frederick Jackson Turner showed how the paths of the Indians became the " traces " of the venturesome traders , and how these in turn became the ways that serve travel and transport needs in our time . " Civilization in America , " he said , " has followed the arteries made by geology , pouring an ever richer tide through them , until at last the slender paths of aboriginal intercourse have been broadened and interwoven into the complex mazes of modern commercial lines .. . It is like the steady growth of a complex nervous system for the originally simple , inert continent . If one would understand why we are today one nation , rather than a collection of isolated states , he must study this economic and social consolidation of the country . " The paths evolved slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjacent trees . Down to our times , between the Patuxent and the Potomac , the Three-Notch Road echoed that custom of blazing as it was ordered by law in Maryland . The term , " notch road , " came about because axemen , clearing paths through the forest , notched trees on each side of the trail . The theory was that the space between the trees was to be cleared of stumps and brush . In 1704 , said Paul Wilstach in his Tidewater Maryland , an act was passed ordering each road leading to a ferry , courthouse or church to be marked on both sides with two notches on each tree . Roads to courthouses had an extra notch higher up . A road to a ferry had to have three equidistant notches . A road to a church had to have " a Slipe Cutt down the face of the tree near the ground . " In the northern colonies , notches were also used to mark trails which were to be kept clear of stumps , rocks and fallen branches . When horses began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " riding and tying . " One person ( or couple ) would ride some distance , tie the horse to a tree , and then proceed on foot . Those who followed would , on reaching the horse , climb into the saddle , and ride on past those who were now on foot . Farther along , the  | riders would dismount , tie the horse , and continue on foot . By riding and tying , everybody got a chance to rest , including the horse . In colonial times , however , travel on horseback was mainly for " the happy few . " Most people stayed at home , or close to home . Many lived their whole lives without ever having ventured more than 20 miles from where they were born . For those who ventured into the countryside in the early 1700s there were few bridges , a condition which imposed many handicaps , in view of the fact that travel along the coast was a series of short rides between streams . Fords were called " wading places , " but were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far upstream as tides were felt , ferries were required . In Massachusetts , ferrymen were early appointees of the authorities , and were therefore considered important people in the communities . They often ran inns and livery stables in addition to ferries . The early post riders , like those of the Persians , the Romans and the Mongols , were official couriers , carrying state documents , not mail as we now undertand the word . The first one , riding out of New York on January 22 , 1673 , carried messages from the Governor of New York to officials in Boston . It took him three weeks to reach Boston . Discontinued for a time because hostile Indians killed too many riders , the service was resumed in 1685 , and continued without interruption until , as we saw , Benjamin Franklin converted it into a true mail-carrying system . The post riders did not go all the way . Around what is now Saybrook , Connecticut , riders from Boston and New York exchanged saddlebags ; and , after a drink or two and perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post riders were making regular trips between Boston and Williamsburg , Virginia . North of Boston , service by post rider was tried as early as 1707 , but the service was irregular , a rider being able to go about 30 miles in a day in summer , and much less in winter . In Maine , in 1734 , the building of a long wooden toll bridge by a Colonel Westbrook brought sudden and long-lasting prosperity to the village of Stroudwater . The bridge was so well placed that virtually all overland traffic went over it ; and Stroudwater became a popular overnight stop , with Broad 's Tavern , run by Silas Broad , the pre ferred of many eating and drinking establishments along , busy West brook Street . Stroudwater 's era of great prosperity lasted until the early 1800s when a bridge over the Fore River and a turnpike over Scarborough Marshes eliminated the need for the long detour to Westbrook 's Bridge , and the community declined .  | Road-building in Maine in the latter half of the 1700s benefited from that most industrious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native-born colonial to become an English baronet . It was Pepperrell who , in 1758 , directed 4,300 rum-soaked colonials in the almost incredible feat of capturing and destroying the formidable fortress of Louisburg , which Vauban had designed and the French had built on Cape Breton Island to guard the approaches to the Grand Banks and the St. Lawrence highway into New France . The Pepperrell domain , embracing just about everything from Portsmouth north in what is now Maine , was ruled from Kittery Point , across the Piscataqua from Portsmouth . There , Sir William 's father had built the mills that prepared the " King 's masts " from the tall pines floated down from the White Mountains ; and there the multiple Pepperrell enterprises grew as adjuncts to shipbuilding and shipping . An ingenious businessman , Pepperrell raised the money to bridge the Saco River by runnning a successful lottery . After he became Sir William , he dressed flamboyantly in flaming scarlet . To visit his countless enterprises in the Pepperrell empire , he maintained a magnificent coach , one of the first in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of servants colorfully uniformed . Since the 30-mile stretch of road between Kittery and Saco was entirely on his property , he could have the road maintained to enable him to travel like a baronet should . The Maine dynasty of the Pepperrells fell on evil days during the Revolution , when Sir William 's Loyalist grandson fled to England the patriots picked up the pieces ; but , while it lasted , it gave Maine some good roads and bridges at a time when the more densely populated colonies to the south had few good roads and scarcely any bridges . It was not , however , until Benjamin Franklin united the colonies with his mail roads that there was a well-traveled road to Portsmouth and on to Portland . A so-called " coach " service went into operation between Portland and Portsmouth in 1787 . The " coach " was an open buckboard wagon , with no top , and with backless benches that must have given the hardy riders a frightful beating as the springless conveyance , pulled by two horses , rocked and jounced over stones and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Portland every Saturday morning early and arrived in Portsmouth on Monday . For those with the courage and hardihood to use it , the intervening Sabbath must have been anything but a day of rest and recreation .  | Taverns and inns , in the northern colonies especially , were , like those of England , popular places for meetings , formal and informal , of local residents , especially business men , as well as refuges for tired , hungry and thirsty travelers . In Maine , for example , almost every mile of road had a tavern . In the colonies , as in the Mother Country , bad roads made for good taverns or vice versa . The roads with most traffic in the 1700s were those between Boston , New York , Philadelphia and Baltimore . What such roads were like may be imagined by considering the fact that , when he rushed from Philadelphia to Boston to take command of the Continental Army in 1775 , George Washington was 12 days on the road . Ox carts with solid wheels were perhaps the first vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , and a number of fine breeds were bred here . Indeed , it was often possible for a traveler to buy a horse , ride to the next stage ( usually an inn with a livery stable ) and trade for another horse there . Horse-trading thus developed into an occupation requiring considerable skill , and the horsethief was early looked upon as a most reprehensible kind of criminal . The roads of Maryland were then being improved with gravel on the western side of the Bay , but the best roads of all were the long white stretches of delightfully smooth surface on the Eastern Shore , where the mixture of native sand and broken oyster shells made for travelers ' joy . Maryland was popular not only for its two good north-south roads , but because of its excellent inns . An especially good one was Hollingsworth 's Tavern , at the head of the Elk River , where Elkton now is , and where the colony 's two fine roads converged . The western road went to Lower Susquehanna Ferry ( now Havre de Grace ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch went east to Annapolis and the other west to Georgetown , where it linked with Georgetown Road , the main highway into upper Virginia . The eastern way out of Head of Elk was the main inter-colony highway , largely because of its excellent surface . Aided by good ferry service over Bohemia and Sassafras Rivers , it went to Rock Hall on the Bay , above Kent Island , where the traveler could take the popular ferry over the Bay to Annapolis . Southwest from Maryland 's gay and charming capital , a well-traveled highway crossed the Patuxent at Marlboro and then went west to ferry crossings of the Potomac at Port Tobacco and Leonardtown . Philip Vickers Fithian from Princeton , New Jersey , who was hired as a tutor by a family on the Potomac , jotted in his journal details of trips to and from there on horseback in 1773 . From other letters  | and journals one learns that travel through the area was even better in severe winters , when tidal rivers into the Bay froze over so that horse-drawn vehicles could cross on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the inns became less alluring . The reason was that , in the Cavalier society , the tradition of reciprocal hospitality was scrupulously maintained by people who , though they may have had town-houses , much preferred to live in fine homes in the country , such as Mount Vernon and Monticello . Through this period while trails were evolving into roads , most of them inferior , a new factor was making itself felt as a stimulus to road building : the increase of trade . Because of the greater width of the shelf between sea and mountains , and because of the more diversified skills of the people who migrated to the area , Pennsylvania took an early lead in the development of commerce . By the mid-1700s , Professor Turner noted , the German farmers who had settled there were bringing woven linen , knitted woolens , firkins of butter , dried fruits , grain , and many other products to Philadelphia . By then , too , Baltimore , laid out in 1730 , was becoming a rival of Penn 's well-planned city as a marketplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania " Dutch " contributions to the development of our nation . In the first place , they were not Dutch ; they were , rather , a mixture of peoples , mostly from the lands bordering the Rhine , and generally members of religious sects with beliefs similar to those of the Quakers . They were predominantly speakers of German ; and , though they were excellent farmers , they were not farmers exclusively . There were , among them , many fine craftsmen of the kinds that the evolving mercantilist policies of Britain tended to bar from migration from England to the colonies . It was from the shops on the farms of these non-English folk , men and women of multiple skills , that this nation got two tools which , more than any other physical things , were most responsible for the winning of our national independence , and the rapid conquest of the frontier . Those tools were the rifled firearm , and the Conestoga wagon , named after Conestoga Creek in Lancaster County . That wagon became the prime mover in the colonies and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in the French and Indian and the Revolutionary Wars . Variations of it , such as the prairie schooner , were the chief conveyances for the successive waves of westward migration up to the end of the 19th century . The Studebaker brothers of South Bend , Indiana , whose wagons in that  | century were the most popular freighters in peace and war , were descended from those Conestoga Creek blacksmiths and wheelwrights . The Conestoga is often confused with the prairie schooner of a century later . Perhaps the most significant thing about the Conestoga was its brakes , curved blocks faced with leather , which could be pressed against the rear wheels by a pull on a long iron lever . Possibly the first mass-production of anything in the American Colonies was the fleet of 150 Conestoga wagons that Benjamin Franklin , acting on behalf of the English government , got the Pennsylvania " Dutch " to build for the ill-fated expedition that British General Edward Braddock led into a French-Indian ambush in 1755 . Franklin 's appeal to the Pennsylvania German craftsmen came about when General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move supplies for his army 's march into the forest against the French at Fort Duquesne . While Pennsylvania was enjoying its commercial emergence , trade was also beginning to appear in Virginia . As demand for tobacco expanded , and settlement on the upper James increased , Richmond grew at the falls of the river , beginning in 1737 . Plantations spread back into the Piedmont ; but , at that distance , rolling became prohibitive , and people began turning from tobacco to other sources of income . Some of them traded furs at first ; others turned to grains , and later added cattle and horses to what they offered at the marketplaces . For the new crops different kinds of vehicles were needed . What then came into use were the packhorse trains , developed by those daring trailblazers on the farthest frontiers , the people whom we would nowadays call backwoodsmen , but who called themselves " borderers . " They developed the packhorse by crossing Indian ponies with the larger horses of the Pennsylvania Germans . In the fall , the families on the frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of packhorses , with several drivers and guards under a master driver . The caravan carried , in addition , food for the men and feed for the horses . Part of the feed had to be cached on the trail for the return trip . The bags that had held the feed used by the horses on the way to market were usually packed with salt , to be taken back to the frontier families . Each animal carried from 150 to 200 pounds and was tied to the pack-saddle of the animal in front , with the driver leading the way . Packhorse caravans , sometimes with as many as 500 animals in train , were a commonplace on the American scene for more than a  | century . They remained in use long after other forms of transport came into being . As farm products from the interior increased in variety and quantity and as more tools and other manufactured products from the seacoast markets had to be carried inland for greater distances , the emerging needs caused the development of crude and huge carts , top-heavy vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by oxen over the rough , stump-studded trails , through the bogs , and across the streams at the fords . Next , as the trails were improved into semblances of roads and as ferries replaced fords , such minor improvements in their turn influenced the increasing use of wagons . Merchants in the Tidewater or seacoast cities began to use the Conestoga wagons to penetrate the far frontier . There they could barter with storekeepers who had taken furs and hides , grain and flour , and other products of the frontier as payment for goods in the trading transactions that were carried on in times when money was seldom seen . The proliferation of such wagons , either owned by the merchants or rented by them from wagoners who charged by weight and distance and road-condition , spurred further improvement of roads . One can but try to imagine what hauling was like on those back-country roads when the snow melted on the mountains and the rains helped turn the clay into something neither quite liquid nor solid , and the animals floundered in the morass belly-deep . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Winchester , Georgetown , Alexandria , Frederick , Bladensburg , Baltimore and Philadelphia , and wondering if and when the drivers would get through . It is not hard to understand how they gradually became advocates of road-improvement . It was the " borderers " who first dared to cross the mountains and settle there ; from the south as early as 1732 , the Virginians ; and , from the north , the Germans and later Scotch-Irish from Pennsylvania . In the lush Shenandoah Valley , said Dale Van Every , the " borderers " first recognized their identity as a separate people . Here they first realized that whatever advantage or relief they hoped for would have to be the result of their own exertions . Geography was responsible for their isolation . The Valley of Virginia , as it is sometimes called , is a 200-mile trough , running north and south , between the Blue Ridge and the main Appalachian Range . It was , therefore , cut off from the older settlements of Virginia . The nearest Indian settlements were those of the Cherokees far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shawnees even farther away to the northwest across the Ohio River . The migration into the trough was not , therefore , the slow movement from farm to farm that was the characteristic in other areas ; it was , rather , the simultaneous movement of whole groups of people by covered wagon which became commonplace west of the Mississippi a century later . The Quaker father of Daniel Boone , for example , moved his family and household goods in one 500-mile trip in wagons from the Susquehannah in Pennsylvania down through the Valley and on to the Yadkin River in western North Carolina . This combination of circumstances produced the self-reliant frontier culture which , as Van Every pointed out , made the Valley " the source and focus for the frontier energy . " All over the colonies , an insatiable lust for land was manifesting itself , but people less adventurous than the " borderers " were deterred by misgivings as to what lay beyond the mountain barriers . Before crossings of these barriers could become general migrations , a few daring and knowledgeable trailblazers had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be painstakingly made by assembling such records and reports . For that task of map-making , Philadelphia had the right men . For that important step , the making of maps , there was first of all , John Bartram , the Quaker naturalist who could go anywhere in the wilderness because the Indians knew and respected him as the friend of every living thing . Next , there was Dr. Lewis Evans , the friend of Franklin , who combined the skills of surgeon , surveyor , illustrator and cartographer . Finally , there was Franklin himself , insatiably curious about everything but first and foremost a good printer . It was to Franklin that men went with information that was assembled bit by bit into maps . On one horseback journey from Philadelphia to the Great Lakes in 1743 , Bartram was accompanied by Dr. Evans . That trip resulted in a map , published by Dr. Evans in 1749 . Another map , published in 1755 as part of a geographical pamphlet written by Evans and printed by Franklin , has become a curiosity because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot where the first successful oil well was drilled a century later : Titusville , Pennsylvania . That later map was based on information brought to Dr. Evans by John Davison , Indian trader and interpreter , who accompanied Major George Washington into the wilderness on his first historic mission for the governor of Virginia . But the most famous map was that of John Mitchell , which was  | published in 1755 after five years of meticulous cross-checking of assembled data from scores of traders ' and hunters ' reports . Mitchell , like Bartram , was a botanist , and corresponded regularly with Linnaeus . He was also a physician , and as such had written a treatise on yellow fever which was highly regarded by Dr. Benjamin Rush in Philadelphia . But it was as cartographer that he is best remembered , for his famous map , prepared under commission of the Board of Trade in London , was the basis for the campaigns with which the British forces ousted the French from Canada and the area east of the Mississippi . Along with the mapmakers there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received grants . Among these were the Loyal Land Company , organized by central and southern Virginians , having received grants of 800,000 acres of wilderness to the southwest ; and the Ohio Company , composed mainly of northern Virginians , with grants of 200,000 acres at the Forks of the Ohio , both grants being , of course , in French territory . The explorer for the Loyal Company was Dr. Thomas Walker , who headed a party of five intrepid men into the mountains in 1750 and found and named Cumberland Gap through which Daniel Boone was later to pioneer for the Wilderness Road into Kentucky . The Ohio Company 's " land-looker " was Christopher Gist , a veteran frontiersman and experienced surveyor from North Carolina . Gist was aided by Thomas Cresap , a Marylander who had established a trading post far up the Potomac on the eastern slope of the Allegheny Ridge . They blazed a route in 1751 from the Potomac to the Ohio which they named Nemacolin 's Path after Cresap 's Indian friend , Nemacolin the Delaware . An Ohio company 's storehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now Cumberland , Maryland ) near Cresap 's post . Gist set up his station on top of Chestnut Mountain , and a few settlers moved in . All was going well when Robert Dinwiddie arrived from England to take up his post as Governor of Virginia , with orders to forward the interests of the Ohio company . He had barely unpacked at Williamsburg when he received warning that the French were moving in to stop these intrusions . The governor sent for a 21-year-old surveyor , then serving his first year as a major of militia in Virginia , and gave him a message to deliver to the French commander who , in Dinwiddie 's opinion , was a trespasser . Thus was George Washington projected into public life . Washington 's assignment in that October of 1753 was to make the dangerous 500-mile journey into the interior to warn the French : leave the settlers alone . At Winchester , the party picked up Christo- pher Gist and several other traders and headed for the Monongahela over Nemacolin 's Path in weather that varied from pelting rain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they picked up John Davison , the trader skilled in the Indian dialects of the region , who furnished so much information for that famous 1755 map with the first intimation of petroleum on it . On the way , Washington noted in his journal that the site where the Monongahela and the Allegheny join to form the Ohio would be idea for a fort . His judgment was eminently correct , for this site , where Pittsburgh 's Golden Triangle now stands , was soon to become French Fort Duquesne and , later , British Fort Pitt . Reaching the French commander , and being told politely but firmly that the French considered the English to be interlopers , Washington started back . He reached Williamsburg exactly a month later , having survived blizzards , near-drownings , loss of horses , and Indian attempts to waylay him . His report , along with the translation of the French answer to Dinwiddie 's letter , is a fascinating little volume which has been issued in facsimile as a Colonial Williamsburg Publication . Publication of the report , describing French activities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England and the colonies , it started a reputation that was to grow steadily . Dinwiddie , not waiting for instructions from London , sent Washington back into the wilderness in April at the head of two companies of Virginia militiamen who had been enticed into service by promises of Ohio land . Washington began to hack out a wider clearance over Laurel Mountain , across Great Meadows , to Gist 's post on Chestnut Mountain , and thus Nemacolin 's Path became Washington 's Road . As Washington 's force of about 150 men advanced into the wilderness , word came that the French at Fort Duquesne had been reinforced to a strength of 1,000 men and 18 cannon . A later report put the enemy strength at about half that total . Even so , what could the small band of colonials , painfully building a road through the forest yard by yard , hope to do against those French regulars and their Indian allies ? Washington 's defeat by the French at Fort Necessity ( near present Farmington , Pennsylvania ) on the the Fourth of July , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date of July 4th later took on better significance for Americans . That same year , Major General Edward Braddock became commander of English forces in America , and assumed responsibility for driving out the French . He designated Washington as an aide . Setting forth on his campaign , he worked his way to the old Ohio  | Company warehouse on Will 's Creek , and built a fort there . He named it after the Duke of Cumberland , the King 's second son , who was then Captain-General of His Majesty 's military establishment , and who had won recognition primarily for losing battles . Cumberland was in command at Fontenoy in 1745 when the English , for the first time in three centuries , broke ranks and ran from the French ; and at Culloden , where the supporters of " the Young Pretender , " Charles Stuart , were defeated . In 1757 , in the Seven Years ' War , he was to have the further distinction of capitulating to the French at Kloster-Zevern after his army 's defeat at Hastenbeck . It was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeless that Franklin arranged for those 150 Conestoga wagons . The movement of Braddock 's army was slowed by the stupendous task of building a road through primeval forest and up and down craggy slopes with such tools as axe , mattock , pick and shovel . Nemacolin 's Path , widened by Washington into a pack-horse trail , now had to be widened again , not only for the usual two-wheel carts of the army and the heavier guns , but for those great four-wheeled Conestoga wagons , with their multiple spans of draft-animals . As Braddock 's forces approached Fort Duquesne , the French were in a bad way , with only about 300 men on duty . Drought had dried up the streams , keeping canoe-borne reinforcements from arriving , and reducing supplies to the point where the 500 Indians at the Fort were becoming restless . When Braddock reached the Monongahela , victory for the English seemed a foregone conclusion . Washington , who was ill , crawled from his bed in a wagon to have a part of the triumph . At this point , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambush . Only after long argument did the Indians agree to participate , for they had spied on the advancing army of 1,200 men and had seen their big guns . The English had crossed the ford and were within sight of the fortress when the history of warfare turned a corner . The Indians at that point made the fateful discovery that the white man was even more foolish than the red man had thought him to be : those disciplined men in their solid columns would be as easy to kill as whitefish running in tightly packed schools through the rapids at Sault Sainte Marie . The slaughter lasted for three horrible hours . For the total English force engaged , the loss of 853 officers and men was a casualty rate of more than 70 percent . Braddock , himself , mortally wounded , ordered a retreat .  | " The essence of the Indian discovery , " wrote Dale Van Every , " was that every element of strength which made an 18th Century army formidable in the field , its iron discipline , its close-ordered formations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and batteries of artillery , became automatically transposed into so many elements of weakness when battle was joined in the forest . " After that moment on that road , war was never to be quite the same again , although most military professionals took at least another century to discover that a change had occurred . Washington 's defeat at Fort Necessity and Braddock 's at Fort Duquesne turned out to be the beginning of the decade-long French and Indian War . Word of the Indians ' Fort Duquesne victory spread out to all the tribes ; and , except for the mostly-neutral Iroquois in the north , they flocked to the French side . Turning the tables on the settlers , who had moved westward over the mountains , bands of Indian warriors moved eastward over the barrier to kill settlers and livestock , to burn farms , to carry off captives by the hundreds . They devastated a belt from 20 to 50 miles wide along the border of Pennsylvania , Maryland and Virginia . The attacks fell off that winter but were renewed with greater fury and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What made the toll mount fast was the colonists ' unpreparedness for the attacks ; there had been no Indian attacks in the middle colonies for more than a generation . It was not until the great William Pitt came to power as Prime Minister in England in 1758 that anything of importance began to be done about this mounting danger ; and what was then done succeeded in punching another hole in the barrier ; another road was built over the mountains . That mountain road was the work of a Swiss military commander , Henri Bouquet , who came to America in 1756 to enter the service of the English . Two years later , when Pitt sent a young Scots brigadier , John Forbes , to do what Braddock had failed to do , Bouquet and his command were sent to Philadelphia to join him . Other forces , including Washington and his Virginians , were also assigned to Forbes ; and , when he had them all assembled , they were a formidable force of 6,000 men , with Bouquet in command of the first division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced a formidable task . It was the same one that had confronted Braddock . Before there could be an attack on the French and Indians there had to be an attack on this mountainous wilderness .  | Forbes wondered whether he should take this army over the Braddock Road , or cut a new road straight westward along the trail used by Pennsylvania traders . Washington argued forcefully for use of the Braddock Road , on the sensible grounds that the time required to cut a new road would delay the attack beyond the end of good weather . Bouquet , who had pushed westward over a road laid out by Croghan in 1755 , favored a new and shorter road from there . During the argument , Forbes was hit by an attack of dysentery , a disorder from which he was never to recover . Relying on the more experienced of his two subordinates , he ordered Bouquet to proceed with his plan ; Washington graciously acceded to his superior 's judgment . So , on August 1 , 1758 , a new road began as Bouquet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went straight up the face of the main Allegheny Ridge and then over the even more forbidding heights of Laurel Mountain beyond . " This was one of the great dates in American history , " wrote Dale Van Every . " Only an army under the pressures of wartime could have underwritten the stupendous cost and labor of constructing such a road . Not in the foreseeable future could it have been undertaken by private initiative or the resources of a single province . " Washington , who had been occupied in another sector , returned and took charge of the road-building over the gentler slopes of Chestnut Ridge . The work was halted by autumn rains , but Forbes was not much concerned about the delays because he knew that time was working against the French . The French supply line had been cut by a naval raid in the north , at Fort Frontenac ; and the English cause had been strengthened , also , by a series of conferences with Indians , conducted by George Croghan , an Irish trader , and the Moravian missionary , Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pennsylvania , in October , at which the Indians were convinced that the English intended to reserve all territory west of the mountains for Indian use and occupancy and cancel all colonial claims to such lands . Croghan 's name seldom appears in American histories , but he was one of the real heroes of that era . In November , one of Washington 's patrols took a prisoner from whom they learned that Fort Duquesne was being held by only a token force , for the French had not expected the English to attack until spring . Washington was sent ahead to clear a trail . On the night of November 24 , his force camped at Turtle Creek , within sight of the spot where Braddock 's army had been destroyed three years before .  | Then , during the night , the English and colonials were heartened by the sound of explosions and the sight of flames ; Captain Francois de Ligneris was blowing up and burning Fort Duquesne before abandoning it . Next morning they marched in . Washington went back to Mount Vernon to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , went back over Bouquet 's road in his litter , intermittently unconscious . He was welcomed as a hero . The following March , he died . Bouquet remained at " The Fork , " where he rebuilt Fort Pitt ; and , with Croghan 's help , established good relations with the Ohio Indians . He was vexed by the spectacle of settlers crossing the mountains , on the road he had built , to establish themselves in the red man 's domain . The Indians complained , and he ordered the white interlopers to get out . They said they were " hunters , " but the Indians protested that they had cut down trees to build log huts , and to clear space for planting corn . Bouquet complained to colonial governors , and sent soldiers to chase the " vagabonds , " as he called them . Then , in 1763 , two things happened . First , the Treaty of Paris ended the French and Indian War as far as the French were concerned . The British were in control of Canada and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second , in the hope that it would put an end to the conflict between colonists and Indians , the government in England proclaimed the exact boundaries for the newly acquired lands in America . This Proclamation Line ran from Canada to Florida , dividing English America into eastern and western parts . It ran along the crest of the mountains , following the divide , separating the watersheds of streams that empty into the Atlantic from those that find their way into the St. Lawrence , the Great Lakes and the Mississippi . The claims of the colonies to land west of that line were annulled . Title to land west of the line could no longer be obtained by any person , and all intrusions west of the boundary were to be only by express permission of the King . Everything west of the Proclamation Line was hereafter reserved for the undisturbed occupancy of the Indians . Though nobody suspected it at the time , that Royal edict against land-ownership beyond the mountains lighted a fuse that was to burn slowly but steadily into an explosion of colonists ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than anything else , brought the Virginians into the Revolution which the New Englanders began . In 1763 , however , that Proclamation Line had everything in is favor . It could be seen from afar , whether you were east or west it . It was a natural division , not only topographically but in m  | more meaningful ways . East of it was a people emerging from the Middle Ages , people putting together a civilization based on the industry of enterprising humans ; west of it , scattered tribes barely emerged from the Stone Age . Although one colony seldom agreed with its neighbor about anything , every colonial assembly applauded the newly proclaimed Line because it offered hope of an end to the long and deadly warfare between settlers and Indians . The Indians , though divided into tribes as confusedly contentious as the peoples of Europe , favored the Line because all realized that continued existence of their way of life , and indeed their own existence , depended on the holding of that Line . We know , nevertheless , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not hold . An important reason for the failure was that it had already been breached by roads , some of them started as military works . There was that road that Bouquet had built over Laurel Mountain . And the route through Mohawk country in the north as a gateway to the western Great Lakes . And the tortuous trail to the Delaware ( yap . So , despite the Line and the memory of the Indian ravages that had followed Braddock 's defeat in 1754 , settlers sneaked through those holes into forbidden territory . Before the year of 1763 had ended , the violations of the newlyestablished Line had stirred new ferment . Bouquet heard the chilling news that the Indians , fed up with broken promises , were rallying for a war of white extermination under Chief Pontiac . He was ordered to take military action , first , to bring a halt to attacks in the area around Fort Pitt . He completed this mission with a force of only 200 men , employing strategy that taught the Indians to respect this woods-wise Swiss soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere , except Pittsburgh and Detroit , Bouquet set out with a well-equipped force of 500 regulars surrounded by a scouting screen of hundreds of frontiersmen who were as skilled at wilderness warfare as the Indians . Ile took his time although winter was approaching . He cut a road ahead of his force , aiming it straight at the towns and storehouses of the Ohio tribes , the Shawnee , Delaware and Mingo tribes . Bouquet 's unusual army crossed the Muskingum near what is now Coshocton , Ohio , with the axemen cutting the road toward the first of the principal Indian towns . There the Indians sent a delegation to negotiate terms . Bouquet 's terms were simple but stunning ; no parley until all white captives had been returned , and only 12 days for such  | return . Moreover , he added , in that 12-day period , the road would go forward at the same rate . More than 200 captives were delivered . Nearly as many more , the Indians explained , had fled into the woods rather than be returned to the colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adamant order ; and to show that he meant what he said , he demanded hostages to guarantee the return of the rest of the whites to Pittsburgh in the spring . Then , for the first time , he relented to the extent of shaking hands with the chiefs . When the last captive is returned , you can appeal to Johnson of the Mohawks for the return of the hostages , and ask him about peace terms , he said . Leaving them with that mouthful of ashes and gall , he turned his army around and marched back on the road to Fort Pitt . All over the colonies there was rejoicing , with bonfires , ringing bells , thanksgiving services , and wind-milling oratory from the politicians . This was the first white commander who had proved himself capable of going into the wilderness and beating the Indians at their own game . The cowed Ohio tribes decided to stay away from the Pennsylvania-Virginia frontier . The rejoicing reached even into England , but Bouquet knew the war was not over . Pontiac was still at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to recover their lost empire , were supplying the powerful chief from beyond the Mississippi . But , Bouquet was to have no further part in the Ohio Indian wars , which were not to end until 1794 , when " Mad Anthony " Wayne marched over Bouquet 's roads and defeated the red man at Fallen Timbers , near what is now Toledo , Ohio . In April , 1765 , Bouquet was offered a commission as a brigadier general , an almost unprecedented promotion for a foreign-born officer . He accepted and was given command of the Southern Department . Soon after he arrived at Pensacola to take charge he fell ill of a fever which killed him nine days later . His only monument was the road he ran from Lancaster to Pittsburgh and on to the Muskingum in Ohio . Over that road was to roll the great tide of westward migration which , in less than a century , would reach the Pacific . " In the broad panorama of North American history as a whole , " wrote John Bartlet Brebner in 1933 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of population from the Atlantic to the Pacific , and it has become such a commonplace that there is some danger of its being taken for granted as a feature of the colonial history of the 17th century .  | " As a matter of fact , it was not until about 1768 that the expanding populations of the coastal colonies burst through the Appalachians to occupy the heart of the continent . When they did so , they found well-beaten trails , skilful , knowledgeable guides , and Indians who had dealt with the white man for a century , for the eastern Mississippi basin had been explored from north and south and east and west by men who , almost anonymously , risked their lives to provide Europe with its furs and buckskin . " It is a matter of regret to us now that their own generations did so little to record and commemorate their achievements . " There were other roads to the west which became temptations to the land-hungry after the French and Indian War and the ensuing Indian uprising under Pontiac 's leadership . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Johnson 's demesne , to the Great Lakes . It was especially alluring after the English had gained control of the key to the whole system now known as the St. Lawrence Seaway : the relatively short portage road around Niagara . It opened the way to Lake Erie , to Detroit , by then almost a century old , and beyond that community to the upper lakes of the great French water road into the heart of the continent . During the Revolutionary War , and immediately after it , there was much traffic on this road as people , branded as " Tories , " but calling themselves " Empire Loyalists " flocked north into what was Huronia ( now the Canadian province of Ontario ) until the Iroquois destroyed their cousins , the Hurons . In the south , a congeries of happenings and trends was creating a situation which was to bring about historic events at the head of another famous travel path : the Wilderness Road . The locale was the area that was to become Kentucky , which long had been an unexplored part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1600s , bold men from the Carolinas had come as trappers , hunters , traders and land hunters . Some of them ranged as far as the Mississippi , becoming known as the " long hunters " because of the great distance they traveled . This was not beaver country ; the quarry was the vast herds of deer . Buckskin attire became the mark of the frontiersman , and , with the advent of Charleston ( then Charles Town ) and Savannah as seaports , tons of it went to Europe . A fiercely independent people , these Carolinians had revolted in 1677 against the eight lords proprietors to whom Charles II had granted the territory , and had driven six of them from office . They had fought the Tuscaroras at horrible cost in 1711-1713 . And , they had begun armed resistance to enforcement of the Stamp Act in 1765.  | It was such men , and kindred souls from other colonies , who cast their lot with that defiant North Carolina lawyer , Richard Henderson .

With 12,000 of them gathered there in the spring of 1775 , ten Conestoga wagons rolled across the Shenandoah Valley loaded with 10,000 pounds of trade goods ? red shirts , old muskets , mirrors and trinkets . After days of feasting and oratory , the area now known as Kentucky passed into the white man 's hands . Boone promptly set out on the rigorous task of cutting a road westward through the broken terrain to the famous Warriors ' Path of the Indians through Cumberland Gap and then northward to the Kentucky River . This road , from near the headwaters of the James and Roanoke , across the upper reaches of the Kanawha , and thence over the Holston and Clinch tributaries of the Tennessee , was to be the famous Wilderness Road . Its start was in the southern end of the Valley of Virginia . It , with Braddock 's Road , starting in the northern end of the Valley , gave the people of the Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky river with his road , he built a fort , later to be known as Boonesboro . There , on May 23 , 1775 ? while the Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia was in its second week ? 18 delegates from the little Kentucky settlements met at Henderson 's call and heard him propose that the less than 200 frontiersmen declare their independence . He could have had no knowledge of what was then going on in Philadelphia . Under a gigantic elm at this first terminus of Wilderness Road , Henderson declared : " Our peculiar circumstances in this remote country , surrounded on all sides with difficulties , subject to one common danger , which threaten our common overthrow , must . . . secure to us a union of interests ... " And , at the end , he told them , " if any doubt remains amongst you with respect to the force or efficacy of whatever laws you now , or hereafter , make , be pleased to consider that all power is originally in the people . " The delegates heartily endorsed this declaration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only from England but from the colonies whence they had come . They set up a proprietary government which they called Transylvania , and proceeded solemnly to the business of making laws , setting up their courts , organizing militia , etc.  | " An infamous Company of land Pyrates , " was the North Carolina governor 's term for Henderson 's settlers , with Virginia 's governor heartily endorsing the verdict . What was happening at the end of the Wilderness Road was another manifestation of what had been happening in the Shenandoah and at the end of Bouquet 's road into Ohio : the frontiersmen had learned that their only hope of survival depended on what they themselves could do to protect themselves ; that they had better stop depending on the governments of that time , in England or in the colonial capitals . At the heads of these roads thrusting ever deeper into the interior , there was fertile soil for nurturing the spirit of independence that was to spread until it burst all bonds from one end of the Atlantic colonies to the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that people went to places before there was any way to get there ? and took care of their transportation and marketing needs afterward , " said John Chamberlain in The Enterprising American . The years of chaos during the Revolutionary War stopped all development of roads . Even so , in 1789 , Christopher Colles compiled A Survey of the Roads of the United States of America , which was a book with the first known road maps in this country . Little is known about Colles except that he was Irish , was called a " philosophical adventurer , " and is supposed to have built a very early steam engine . As early as 1784 he presented a memorial to the New York Assembly proposing a canal to connect the Hudson with the Great Lakes . After many vicissitudes and 30 years later , that idea became the Erie Canal . Colles seems to have been one of the many forgotten men of history . In April , 1789 , George Washington set out from Mount Vernon to go to New York to be . inaugurated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be done to make the way north smooth and pleasant for him . Where the roads were at their very worst , the citizens had turned out to fill muddy potholes with stones , which only made the going more hazardous for a carriage . Washington kept his saddle horse handy , and when riding in the carriage became more than flesh and blood could longer tolerate , he dismounted and climbed into the saddle . To get from Baltimore to New York in a week , it was necessary to arise before dawn and ride until after dark , with occasional stops at taverns and inns for refreshments and a change of horses .  | The conveyances that Washington passed on the road were far from having even the minimal comforts of his coach . They were usually little more than wagons with leather-covered tops , roll-up leather side-curtains , and plain wooden benches . When one of these so-called coaches threatened to upset , the driver called out , " To the right ! " or " To the left ! " and the pasengers , responding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it got stuck in the mud , which it did regularly , all able-bodied male passengers were expected to get out and push . Travel was not cheap . The fare from Philadelphia to Baltimore was $6.25 with lodging and meals extra ; and , when you consider that it not infrequently took five days to travel those 100 miles , and that the wage of a skilled workman was as low as $2 a week , it is easy to see that that trip , could well cost the equivalent of a month 's income . If you wanted to go from Boston to New York , you then had the choice of a sailing packet at $8.00 one way , meals included , or $10.00 by stage , with meals and lodging extra . Even the mail moved laboriously over the post-Revolutionary roads ; between New York and Philadelphia the carriers , riding horseback and carrying two saddlebags on a trip , went three times a week in summer and only twice a week in winter . Undoubtedly , Washington thought about the young Republic 's problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that in this nation of four million people , there were now many citizens in the thickly settled area of the seaboard who were either setting out for the west or planning to do so . There were families making their way out of New England over the Mohawk Trail , across the Berkshires , to the Hudson and then over other trails over the Catskills into southern New York and toward the Great Lakes . Other families , he knew , were going up the Susquehanna into the interior of Pennsylvania and into New York . From Baltimore and Philadelphia and from many other communities in the middle colonies , restless people were heading westward over the old Forbes-Bouquet military road that Washington had helped to build ? that 12-foot-wide tunnel through the forest past Bedford in the Juniata Defile , to Ligonier and over the Chestnut Ridge , and then on to Pittsburgh and down the Ohio , either along its banks , or on anything that would float them to where they thought they wanted to go . It soon came to be known as the Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Carolinas they were heading for Kentucky over the trail blazed by Daniel Boone , and from eastern Georgia they were going over the mountains to the Tennessee River .  | At least 90 percent of the people going into Kentucky went there by way of the Wilderness Road , a route which even now seems appallingly rugged . By 1790 , more than 70,000 had gone over that road into the Blue Grass State . By 1798 , Boone himself felt that Kentucky was becoming too crowded and left for Spanish lands in Missouri ; at least that is part of the Boone legend , for which his ghost-writer , John Filson , was responsible . By 1800 , there were more than 220,000 people in Kentucky , which had been primeval wilderness only 25 years earlier . Those who left records of what they saw on that road indicate that it was a road only in the sense that it was a series of ruts and grooves carved by the wear of constant travel . It wound through broken , rocky terrain from Fort Chissel , Virginia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several directions . At the Virginia end , too , it developed a fork-like arrangement of well-worn trails on which migrants from Pennsylvania , Maryland , the Carolinas and Georgia joined the Virginians going west . The westward flow into Ohio had mounted into a flood-tide after General Wayne had defeated the Indians at Fallen Timbers on the Maumee River near present-day Toledo in 1784 , and the Treaty of Greenville had secured all of Ohio for white settlement . Many of these people were families of men who had served in the Continental Army and had received delayed payment with land grants . Unlike the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch , most settlers were not good farmers ; in the coastal farms , they " mined " the soil so thoughtlessly that the land became exhausted , and the only escape from privation was migration . As one commentator wrote : " When Eastern farmers heard that corn grew nine inches in one night in Ohio , their fingers itched to guide their plows through the rich Ohio soil . " Thomas Jefferson helped them on that score , too , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legal settlement of the areas had started soon after 1787 at Marietta . Other settlements soon sprang up on both banks of the Ohio River . The trouble with such settlements along the rivers beyond the Appalachians was that , though it was becoming easier to reach them from the east , it was not easy to transport farm and forest products back to the eastern markets . Travel upstream by way of the Ohio to Pittsburgh was slow , laborious , and usually dangerous . In summer , the hazards were unmarked sandbars ; in winter there were ice-jams and moving floes except when the stream was entirely locked in ice . The transport problem that bothered the settlers was being underscored in the established areas by the expansion of industry and  | commerce that came with the end of the Revolution . As a single instance of that trend : In that year when Washington became President a young man in England , having served his apprenticeship in a textile factory , emigrated to America . He was Samuel Slater . He was not allowed to take with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture , for the English were determined to keep that monopoly intact . But customs inspectors can not examine people 's heads ; so , when he arrived , Slater constructed from memory an entire spinning mill at the falls of the Pawtucket River in Rhode Island , and , hiring a work force , taught his people how to run the mill . Mass production was beginning in America , but the transport tools to make it work effectively were not yet available . People were dreaming of canals , so that boats could go further inland ; and even Washington had been involved in a plan to put a canal around the rapids of the Potomac . Businessmen , owners of mines and quarries , were wondering , as they were in England , about the possibilities of laying down wooden rails from the sites of their operations to the nearest river , so that carts and wagons could be moved more easily with heavier loads . Here , as in England , the idea of the railway was germinating . John Fitch ? ahead of his time insofar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamboat carrying passengers between Philadelphia and Jersey two decades before Robert Fulton 's Claremont made its maiden trip up the Hudson . Because the Hudson River was a road where products of the interior could move without interruption , New York was threatening Philadelphia , which had surged ahead as America 's largest and busiest city . To overcome New York 's advantage , Pennsylvania , in the spring of 1792 , granted permission to a private company to build a toll-road 62 miles into the interior to Lancaster , already growing into a prosperous inland market center for the world 's most productive farms . Lancaster early became the Nation 's largest city not on navigable water . The Lancaster Pike , as it came to be known , was a road carefully planned . It was 24 feet wide , surfaced with limestone on a gravel base ( actually a kind of macadam construction ) and it had wide grassy slopes bordering its sides . It took two years to build , and it cost the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike Road Company $465,000 , which seemed costly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the good road that the stockholders were happy too . The profits were so attractive that they stimulated the building of other toll-roads , often where they were not needed . The principal traffic on the Lancaster Pike was the great Conestoga wagons , proudly flaunting the colors of the Republic : upper body  | red , canvas gleaming white , and underbody blue . They were soon joined by stage-coaches , also brilliantly decorated . For the travelers in the coaches there were taverns , in many of which all the best traditions of the English inn were adopted . For the wagoneers , a clannish lot with undisguised contempt for coach drivers , there were special taverns , called " wagonhouses . " The taverns , like the vehicles , were colorful , inside and out , for early Americans liked their colors riotous . Since most people were illiterate , it was the golden age of the picture-sign , with the signpainter 's craft a highly developed art . The American custom of driving on the right side of the road probably derived from those wagoneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just back of the wheel-horses , where they were in the best position to contend for the right-of-way with the whip if necessary , or rode on the back of the left wheel-horse , or on the sliding " breadboard " seat that could be drawn out from the left side of the bottom of the wagon 's body , between the front and rear wheels . The expression , " I 'll be there with bells on , " is derived from those wagoneers ' custom of collecting bells for suspension in a cluster from an iron ring on the collar of one of the lead-horses . Those musical bells were not mere warnings ; they were proud symbols of selfreliance and competence ; for it was the rule of the road that the driver who had to accept help from another along the way relinquished his bells to the one who had helped him . Those tough wagoneers , who were not above maiming one another with whips in contending for the right-of-way in tight places , were scrupulously correct about that custom of relinquishing their bells for road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one that has come down to this century ; that long , thin , twisted , dark cigar called the " stogie , " ( short for Conestoga ) which was a favorite of those drivers , and which was manufactured in Wheeling , on the Ohio River , when the roads from tidewater over the mountains became the beginnings of the National Road to Pittsburgh . From the coastal cities , the great wagons hauled farm tools , hardware , household goods , clothing , and other staples to Lancaster , where they were unloaded . From there , the goods went farther on carts , but more often on pack-animals . From the frontier farms and collection stations came potash in leather pouches , grain , salt , furs , hides , pork , and other products of farm and forest . Those frontiersmen who fled from Pennsylvania to Kentucky all passed on their way , whether by land or water , a tiny settlement near  | the head of navigation on the Ohio River ? a place which was to leave its mark indelibly on the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though in Virginia at the time , it is now in West Virginia . The founder , in 1769 , was Ebenezer Zane , accompanied by his brothers , Silas , Jonathan and Andrew . He picked out a spot at the mouth of Wheeling Creek for his settlement . The Zanes cleared the land , built houses , barns , and a stockade , planted crops , and the next year summoned their families . Theirs was the outermost and most exposed settlement on the frontier for many years . Only a river divided it from Indian country until the late 1780s . The Zanes held to their location through two decades of border warfare in which each member of the family had personal experiences that helped write the name Zane large in annals of the frontier . Ebenezer became Colonel Zane in the war with the Indians that ended with the Battle of Point Pleasant in 1774 ? that historic battle in which , for the first time , an army of frontiersmen without British military leadership fought Indians to a stand-still . As disbursing agent for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renamed the place Fort Henry , in honor of Patrick Henry after Virginia renounced allegiance to Britain . His defense of that fort in 1782 is often called the last battle of the American Revolutionary War . When peace came at long last , Ebenezer and Jonathan helped open up for others the wilderness in which they had been able to survive only by their superior skill and good luck . They built roads into Ohio 's interior . They established and operated ferries . They founded towns and cities , among them Zanesville and Zanesfield . Zane Grey , the novelist , was descended from this family whose record encompassed the whole history of the frontier , from the first daring penetration of the wilderness to the time when roads and cities were built . It was Ebenezer Zane who blazed the trail from Pittsburgh to Wheeling , where he built and supplied a general store , and established an inn . Watching the swarm of emigrants come along that trail to the Ohio , and noting how helpless most of them were in trying to build and launch arks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recalled an Indian trace that meandered overland to a point on the river opposite Limestone ( later Maysville ) , Kentucky , where settlers stopped for supplies on their way into the Blue Grass country . He went over that faint woodland trail , measuring distances carefully , and thus discovering that , if it were widened into a road , it would provide a direct overland route from Philadelphia to Frank- fort , Kentucky , which would cut at least 100 miles from the 600-mile route then in use . He had the vexing problem of fording rivers , the Muskingum , the Hocking , the Scioto , the Ohio . In March , 1796 , having decided how to go about launching the project , he petitioned Congress for Federal aid . He asked little from a young nation that had more land at its disposal than anyone knew what to do with . He petitioned Congress that he be permitted to locate military bounty warrants " upon as much land at each of the crossings of the above Rivers as may in their Judgment be sufficient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in due time , &; will also defray all expenses which may be incurred in surveying and laying off such lotts of land . " As war veterans the Zanes were entitled to land warrants as payment for their military service . By the time Congress had granted his request , he had already started work . With a party of not more than eight men , he blazed trees , tore out brush , cleared away fallen timber to open a trail wide enough for horseback riders and pack-animals . The wagon road , he had said , could be made later , at moderate cost . While Congress pondered , he and his crew proceeded as if all had been decided . They had pack-horses with tents and provisions , but lived mostly on game . They posted guards every night , for there was still fear of Indian attack . His clinching argument to Congress was his demonstration that , by use of his trace , three-fourths of the cost of carrying mail could be saved . Congress allowed Zane three tracts , each not exceeding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he intended to cross on the way to the Ohio . For this , he was to pay by opening the road , surveying the tracts , and providing ferry service . Toll rates were to he set by judges of the Northwest Territory . Zane 's Trace , as it was called , followed Wheeling Creek for about seven miles ; then , climbing ridges and dipping into vales , it kept on westward , keeping to high ground and , in some places , probably following the old Mingo Trail . Chillicothe , capital of the Northwest Territory , was the only settlement then on the route ; but as the Trace curved southwestward across Ohio , it passed sites that became Zanesville , St. Clairsville , Washington and Lancaster . The musically-named Chillicothe on the banks of the Scioto was incorporated at the same time as were Detroit , the century-old French setlement to the north , and Cincinnati , the new Ohio River community to the west .  | With the help of Jefferson and of William B. Giles , Representative from Virginia , who had supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building of roads . The Swiss-born Albert Gallatin showed the way to the financing . He had already distinguished himself in the settlement of the whiskey rebellion in 1794 ; in 1795 had won election as a Pennsylvania member of the House of Representatives ; and , had been named Secretary of the Treasury when Jefferson became President in 1801 . He wrote to Giles suggesting that onetenth of the net proceeds of lands sold by Congress be applied to building turnpikes ; that such pikes be built at first from " navigable waters emptying into the Atlantic and Ohio , and afterwards continued through the new State . " He proposed that Congress build such roads , but only with the consent of states through which they passed . Gallatin endorsed his letter with his characteristic script , " Origin of the National Road . " Thus , what began as Nemacolin 's Path and was subsequently Washington 's Road , Braddock 's Road and Cumberland Road , became linked up with parts of Bouquet 's Road and Zane 's Trace into the historic National Road , the first experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon for such a road . At the close of the Revolution , it has been estimated , there were not more than 10,000 settlers west of the mountains . By 1800 , there were more than 220,000 in Kentucky , alone ; more than 105,000 in Tennessee , and 45,000 in Ohio . Mississippi was by then being settled by almost 10,000 . By 1810 there were almost a million settlers in the area now encompassed by Ohio , Kentucky , Tennessee and Mississippi . During the War of 1812 , when the British blockaded the American coast , cutting off immigration from Europe and bottling the coastwise packets in the Atlantic harbors , travel and freight had to move between New England and the colonies to the south by road . The task of building and maintaining the roads quickly became an enormous one as carts and coaches , riders and walkers , pack-trains and Conestoga wagons , plodded and rocked through the mud or the dust and picked their way cautiously around rocks too big to be moved and stumps too huge to be uprooted . For it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads , leaving stumps of a height not greater than 16 inches , which was theoretically low enough to give the axles of wagons , coaches and carts enough clearance . But , as the travelers ' accounts of the time make all too vivid , the theoretical clearance was most often only theoretical because of the ruts cut by the passage of more and more wheels and the hooves of animals and the feet of walkers . At the end of the war , the tide of immigration to America began  | to flow again , and the movement over the mountains swelled once more into a flood of humanity . Between 1810 and 1820 , the number of settlers beyond the ridge increased from 939,000 to 1,644,000 . A curious fact of history is that travel across the roads west of the mountains changed the drinking habits of the American people . Until the Revolution , the most popular tipple in America was rum . Most of it came from New England , where it was an important part of the slave trade and the source of many fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for peach trees , brought to North America by Spaniards , spread like weeds in the southern colonies , and the brandy from their fruit might have become the popular American intoxicant had the trees spread farther north . In the middle colonies , around Delaware and Chesapeake Bays , cider and applejack were consumed in large quantities ; the most popular way of making applejack being the simple one of putting a barrel of cider out in the cold and drawing off the potent portion that did not freeze . In New Jersey , however , apple cider was distilled to provide the apple-brandy that is called calvados in Normandy and came to be called " Jersey lightning " in the colonies . The contribution of the Dutch was gin , originally called Geneva and sometimes called Hollands . But , except among the Dutch , gin won so little acceptance in America that , up to the Prohibition Era of the 1920s , the drinking of gin was generally considered a sort of depravity . Beer and ale came early to the colonies . Nieuw Amsterdam had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the other colonies followed soon after . Actually , most of the people who migrated early to America were drinkers of beer and ale , but learned to drink more potent distillates because it was easier to transport them . The alternatives were water , which people from Europe feared was polluted , or something more potable which was potent enough to be carried economically in casks on the backs of pack-animals . The frontiersman who had found a place to settle usually had a still on his place and kept it in use . A Pennsylvania account of 1683 reports that " most people have stills of copper " and added they made " good spirits " from peaches , cherries , wild plums , wild grapes and corn . Since that " corn " is not defined , we may assume that it was some grain other than maize . But rum won out because it was cheapest , and the amount consumed in the colonies is almost beyond belief . In consequence , by the time of the Revolution , rum distillation was the largest single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumption of rum , which the Dutch called " kill-devil , " had reached the amazing total of 3,700,000 gallons annually . It had won out over all other beverages . Its cheapness and abundance affected history in many ways . One student of the period suggested that one of the prime reasons why the English won out over the French was that they could debauch the Indians more cheaply than could the French with brandy . In the taverns , the ordinaries and the inns , the most popular of all drinks was flip , a concoction of rum and beer , sometimes flavored with black molasses . Most people preferred the burnt and bitter taste it acquired when mulled . To mull it , fire-pokers with large heads were always kept heated in the fireplace so they could be plunged red-hot into a pitcher of flip to make it boil when it was served . Such pokers were called loggerheads , and their frequent use to bring rummy arguments to an end gave us the expression " to be at loggerheads . " Another drink , not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , contained no rum . The recipe calls for half a pint of gin , a quart of beer , a bottle of sherry , the yolks of a dozen eggs , sugar and nutmeg . One who claimed to have tasted it called it " a queer-tasting drink , " and said , " It makes one think somehow of liquid leather , but it carries authority like a man carrying a club . " Finally , there was the popular drink , made of rum , sugar and hot water , which was called bumbo , mimbo and grog . This is the aromatic drink , usually made with one of the distinctive rums of the West Indies , which is still served in Paris as grog americain . In American Ways of Life , a series of lectures he delivered in Greece , George Stewart said that gin , cheaply distilled from fermented mash of grains , might have made better headway to popularity in America had it not encountered a pair of powerful competitors that were also as American in the beginning as rum . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the frontier , both invented and popularized because of the limitations of transport on the early roads . Whiskey was introduced in the 1700s , on the heels of the immigrants from the Rhineland , came hordes of Scotch-Irish , mostly from Ulster , who settled the frontier beyond the Germans . Their national drink was usquebaugh , which is Celtic for aqua vitae ( water of life ) , the designation which the Danes have perpetuated with their akvavit , but which to these Scotch-Irish meant whiskey . On the frontier , these people set up their cookers , fermenting vats and copper stills to make whiskey . Since they lacked the barley used  | in the old country , they tried rye because it happened to be the one cereal grain that grew well in the soil along the Monongahela River . The product was obviously neither Scotch nor Irish whiskey , but its makers had invented a new variety . By the end of the Revolutionary War , Maryland and Pennsylvania rye whiskies were famous all along the seaboard . By then , some 500 stills were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . They were making rye whiskey , the best of which , called Monongahela Rye , became the new American favorite . Grain was the most abundant product of frontier farms . The frontier people could eat it or drink it ; but , because there were no roads worthy of the name , they could not sell it as grain in the East , so they reduced it in bulk and enhanced its value in their stills and lashing a few kegs on the backs of pack animals , carried it to market . Thus whiskey became the money crop of the frontier . A pack-animal could carry no more than four bushels of grain ; but , when the grain was converted to whiskey , the same animal could easily transport 24 bushels as two kegs of whiskey , and the value of that load of whiskey was often the equivalent of 48 bushels of grain . Thus whiskey became the medium of exchange , the stuff with which frontier people bought all the things which neither field nor forest would produce for them . During the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax on their stills to carry on the struggle against England . Then , in 1790 , a group of them petitioned for tax repeal , setting forth as a very sensible reason : " Why should we be made subject to duty for drinking our grain any more than for eating it ? It seems a matter of astonishment to every reflecting mind . " The Pennsylvania legislators saw the sanity of the point , and repealed the tax . The same kind of sanity did not , however , prevail in the federal government . Alexander Hamilton , the Secretary of the Treasury , exerted his influence to get a tax on whiskey enacted into law in 1791 . The result was a roar of indignation on the frontier . People who had just finished a war that began because of onerous taxation , started oiling their weapons for another one . In the Southern colonies fiery oratory denounced the tax as something as intrinsically foul as the recent English imposts on tea and molasses . Kentuckians assaulted revenue collectors , took away their horses and credentials , cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes they tarred and feathered them . What made the furor flare into open rebellion was the forceful seizure of more than 50 men on their farms in harvest time and the  | dragging of those men to far-off Philadelphia where they lay in jails waiting for their cases to be judged . In July of 1794 , an army of rebels , numbering from 5,000 to 7,000 , began marching toward Pittsburgh , as a congress convened in what is now Monongahela to begin moves toward secession from the United States . Washington announced that an army would march west and that he would lead it . By the time the federal force of about 17,000 had crossed the mountains , the Whiskey Rebellion was falling apart . The rebellion failed , but the tax failed , too . It was repealed in the administration of Thomas Jefferson . Eventually , after many changes back and forth between national and local control , as well as from toll road to free road , the National Road , first of America 's great highways , was run as far west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a stirring narrative entitled The National Road by Philip D. Jordan , in The American Trails Series , published by the Bobbs-Merrill Company . The Trails Series also includes The Wilderness Road , by Robert L. Kincaid , and The Overland Trail , by Jay Monaghan , who was general editor of the series . Since most of the National Road was in our time incorporated into U.S. 40 , George R. Stewart 's thoroughly enjoyable book , U.S. 40 : Cross Section of the United States of America , contains much additional fascination for anyone interested in the history of roads . That the National Road ever got started at all was largely due to Jefferson and Gallatin . They saw clearly that , as more and more Americans spilled over the Appalachian barrier into the Ohio River basin , the main highway for these people would become that river , its tributaries , and the Mississippi , with New Orleans , then Spanish , becoming the great port and market center for the interior . Without a road to the Atlantic seaboard , they foresaw the possibility that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along that Proclamation Line at the crest of the mountain range . Their concern about the need for a road was therefore of a piece with that magnificent stroke of Jeffersonian statesmanship and Napoleonic profligacy which more than doubled the size of the United States with the Louisiana Purchase . For , by the time the secret negotiations culminated in that deal , New Orleans was already rolling in riotous prosperity , and the swarm of boats booming down the River was no longer the makeshift craft of immigrants , but freighters bringing down the wealth of that expanding hinterland , in scows , batteaux , arks with pointed stems , Kentucky-boats and flatboats with  | roofs and decks , broadhorns with their great gouge-cars projecting from their bows , barges and rafts , all laden with the produce of the west . Meantime , as the heavily-built keelboat was being developed to take traffic upriver as well as down , and the even more ponderous Ohio packet-boat was evolving from the keelboat , most of the traffic on the great river highway was downbound . The custom was to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take ship to some Atlantic port for the long and expensive trip home , or walk or ride horseback toward home on a series of ancient Indian paths from New Orleans to Natchez and then to Nashville , thence home . The boats were mostly dismantled in New Orleans and used for lumber . It was Jefferson who provided the solution for a problem which might have split the Union into East and West . After the Louisiana Purchase he ordered the Secretary of War to seek treaties with the Southern Indians , mostly friendly , for improvement of the Indian trails . The result was the Natchez Trace which became not only famous , because of the thousands of midwesterners who used it to return to their homes after profitable trips to New Orleans ; notorious , because it became the haunt of some of the most ruthless highway robbers ever inflicted on this land . In marked contrast to the Indians of that area , who numbered among them the most peaceful and friendly aborigines the settlers had ever encountered , was the behavior of the renegade whites who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trace . The grim tale of that dark time and place was assembled by Robert M. Coates in his book The Outlaw Years . As the robber bands prospered and became more powerful , they spread their activities , to Nashville , which had been a French trader 's post since 1760 . The murderous bands even went beyond that city , along the trail to Knoxville , and from there northward over the Wilderness Road to Kentucky . Few people traveled the Natchez Trace alone . The tough rivermen and the farmers and traders usually banded together in groups of a dozen or more , proceeding either on foot or horseback . There were few inns . Travelers carried their own provisions but were sometimes well fed by friendly Indians . At night , great fires were built to scare off bears and wolves , and guards were posted to watch for robber gangs . Post-riders carried the mails over the Trace . Some rivermen ( they were called " alligator-horses , " ) developed into such indomitable walkers that at least one of them , nicknamed " Walking Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nashville three times .  | At Nashville , the Trace ended , and the parties broke up , some gong on north to Zane 's Trace , others going east over the Knoxville Trail , still others taking the Wilderness Road . In time , rude taverns , called " stands , " sprang up along the Trace , but they were crude at best . Unlike most other old Indian trails that were subsequently widened and improved to become wagon roads , the Natchez Trace remained a path for walkers and riders . Its usefulness ended with the advent of the steamboat . In time , it almost vanished entirely , becoming a legend except for a few places where its course could still be found . But , in its day , it cut its mark deep in American history . Along it , in 1809 , Meriwether Lewis , who had been Jefferson 's secretary before Jefferson sent him and William Clark on their great voyage of exploration to the northwest , was mysteriously murdered as he was on his way to report to the President . Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slain in a place called Griner 's Tavern . Four years later , when General Andrew Jackson marched his wilderness army northward from its triumph at New Orleans , he is said to have acquired his nickname , Old Hickory , during the ordeal of the winter march through the terrible country of the Trace . Historically , however , the most important movement over that Trace was perhaps the one that moved in the other direction ; for it was over this trail through forest and swamp that hundreds and hundreds of people from Tennessee , Kentucky , Virginia and parts of Ohio , made their way southward to the Mississippi and across it to Spanish lands in the west . It was these people who settled in Texas and made it an independent nation and eventually part of the United States . In the process the Southwest and California became part of the nation . By the 1820s , the Natchez Trace was falling into disuse , although both Union and Confederate Armies struggled along it 40 years later . But , in 1828 , when the young Abraham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mississippi , they returned by steamboat . On that trip they traveled a thousand miles and were away from home three months ; twenty years earlier the float down and the walk back would have taken most of a year . Looking back at the United States as it was at the start of the 19th century , Henry Adams said that with the exception that half a million people had crossed the mountains " and were struggling in an isolation like that of the Jutes or Angles of the fifth century , " the nation had changed little physically in 50 years . There were by then  | more than five million inhabitants , almost a fifth Negro slaves ; but , said Adams , the monumental task of making something worthwhile of the land 's resources rested on the shoulders of " less than one million able-bodied males . " In his History of the United States of America during the First Administration of Thomas Jefferson , Adams wrote : " The same bad roads and difficult rivers , connecting the same small towns , stretched into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Amherst pierced the western and northern wilderness , except that these roads extended a few miles farther from the seacoast . Nature was rather man 's master than his servant , and the five million Americans struggling with their untamed continent seemed hardly more competent to their task than the beavers and buffalo which had for countless generations made bridges and roads of their own . " Fortunately , we know something about where roads had been built by then , and where they ran , although we can only piece out information about their condition from travelers ' accounts . One of the earliest of all American road maps was published in two sections in 1796 , by Abraham Bradley , Jr . Based on fairly accurate information , the Bradley map is a remarkable piece of work . By studying it , one can see where Americans lived and traveled . It shows post roads and distances , and , in some of the western areas , indicates lands recently surveyed and platted . The first part shows " Nine Northern States , with parts of Virginia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows the southern part of the country , from Washington , D.C. , to a point below Saint Augustine , Florida . This half shows enough of the west to include the Mississippi River from its mouths in the delta , northward to above St. Louis , where the Missouri and Illinois Rivers join the great waterway . From that map one can deduce much about the density of settlement , how settlers traveled first by preference on the waterways , how portage roads were built around waterfalls and rapids and from one waterway to another , how overland roads ran beside rivers and lakes . The Bradley map shows the early stages of development of transport routes especially clearly in the southern half , where much of the land drained by rivers that empty into the Gulf of Mexico was almost devoid of roads . there were Indian villages , some forts , a few trading posts , fewer communities , all widely scattered . Along the Mississippi , settlement had begun to creep northward as far as Natchez . The two maps make it plain that the great highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2,500-mile  | waterway , the Ohio and the Mississippi , and that the missing link in that route was a stretch of about 150 miles between the Ohio and the Susquehanna . This was the key to the whole complex . Once it was possible to haul cargo over the mountains between those two watercourses , the American heartland lay open for development . The Bradley map 's northern section shows how it was done . The Susquehanna was crossed at Harris 's Ferry ( now Harrisburg ) and the road , into which virtually all eastern roads were tied , there struck out westward to Carlisle and Shippensburg and Bedford , and then across the mountains to Pittsburgh and the Ohio River . In the more densely settled portions of the land , the map shows how roads ran parallel to water routes , the Boston Post Road following the shore of Long Island Sound to New York , a road running along the Hudson to Albany , another along the Connecticut River . Elsewhere , careful examination of the map shows where roads struck out across country where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road from Pittsburgh to Wheeling which , as we saw , was hacked out by the Zanes to their remote outpost . Zane 's Trace , the extension of this road through Ohio to Kentucky , is not shown on the Bradley map . What happened in the United States at the start of the 19th century was a release of energy which , when applied to transport , seems nothing short of explosive . First , the roads . Maps of the period show that they were there and that they were being extended in all directions . They were being laid out , surveyed , marked , mapped . Many of them were merely base lines for surveys , little more than paths that surveying parties had blazed in doing their part of the monumental task of charting the seemingly unlimited lands that awaited settlers . The settlers kept moving westward . As Ohio filled up , the Michigan Road , from the Ohio River northward to Lake Michigan , carried an increasing stream of migrants to take up land for homesteads in Indiana . Other streams poured into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake Michigan in the north . Some roads were built by the Army , such as the Territorial Road across southern Michigan from Detroit to Fort Dearborn , the present site of Chicago . Behind the surveyors , measuring land into counties and townships and sections , came the land-hungry people ; and , behind them , in the East , in a constantly swelling tide resembling the effects of an explosion in slow-motion , the pressures of immigration from the Old World mounted until , at the end of the 19th century , that tide was bringing in enough people every year to populate an entirely new large city . Most of those new Americans stopped in the Eastern  | cities , and the need to expand the cities kept producing endless new opportunities for construction of all kinds and for all the possibilities for investment of capital which such new construction brings into being . Some of the immigrants , however , kept going into the interior , many of them creating new communities whose place-names still indicate the countries whence the settlers came . Travelers came to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn that the best roads were often the turnpikes that were privately owned and operated . Others , like the National Road , were intermittently improved and neglected because of sectional jealousies and the two bitterly antagonistic viewpoints about federal control and States ' rights fought out in political campaigns and in Congress . Friends of the National Road held that the Government of the United States was justified in spending national funds to build and improve harbors and waterways and roads . They were bitterly opposed by those who held that it was unconstitutional for Congress to spend such funds for something that benefitted only a section of the country . In consequence , the National Road became a political issue , and its fate changed with almost every change of administration in Washington . President Martin Van Buren 's veto of a National Road bill was so much resented by people along the route that he was deliberately dumped into a muddy hog-wallow in the road by a driver who had been bribed to do it . Even President Andrew Jackson dulled his popularity on the frontier when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an extension of Zane 's Trace into the Blue Grass Region of Kentucky and ambitiously planned to reach New Orleans . The toll collectors along that pike resolutely refused to accept " Jacksonian coins " on grounds that the money was worthless . With few exceptions , in the 1800s , roads were so uniformly bad that travel for pleasure was an outlandish notion . Travel by road for sightseeing was just not worth the trouble . Most road travel was therefore entirely the necessary movement of people and things , people moving to frontier settlements , settlers moving about in their own neighborhoods to fetch and carry what was needed for survival , transport of farm produce and cottage-crafted products to market centers , and the reverse movement of fabricated things from factories to farms . America was mostly rural people until well into the 20th century , and the roads of such people , except for the straight ones laid out in the process of getting the land surveyed , usually meandered , often along the ridges of high ground that Indians had used in getting from  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarreled with the mystic William Blake 's statement , which seems hare-brained to us : " Improvement makes straight roads , but the crooked roads , without improvement , are roads of genius . " In the first third of the century , Conestoga wagons were joined by another uniquely American vehicle , the Concord Coach . The builder was Lewis Downing , who learned carriage-building from his father in his native Lexington , Massachusetts , and who opened up a shop of his own in Concord , New Hampshire , in 1813 , when he was 21 . His business grew steadily , and he began making , also , heavy wagons that inaugurated freighting over the roads from Boston to New Hampshire and Vermont communities . One type of Concord coach carried six passengers ; another carried nine . The coaches left Elm Tavern in Portland at 5 a.m. , stopped at Saco for breakfast , dinner at Portsmouth , supper at Salem , and arrived at Boston at 8 p.m . Each stop for meals required half an hour . Five sets of horses were used for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cape Nedick . The fare was $4 to Portsmouth or $8 to Boston . A slower " accommodation service " with no breakfast , a noon stop at Kennebunk , a night at Portsmouth , another noon meal stop at Newburyport , and arrival in Boston in the evening " in time for supper " on the second day , was offered for a fare of $6 . The Concord Coach won great popularity almost immediately and continued in use years later in the Far West and to the end of the 19th century in many places as a conveyance to carry passengers and their luggage from railroad stations to resort hotels . It still shows up in the popular motion picture and television " Westerns . " The Concord was made of wood , and the popular one was the nine-passenger version in which three passengers were carried on a seat . The center seat was a bench made in three sections , with no back . The passengers were supported by a broad leather strap , fastened to other straps that were anchored at floor and ceiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather thorough-braces , and the rocking motion made many passengers ill . In the course of building the Concords , the art of the wheelwright became a science . To get great strength with light weight , wheels were carefully made of three kinds of wood ; elm for naves , oak for spokes , and ash for felloes . In the 1830s , an American smith added the great improvement of the one-piece iron tire , driven on while hot to add to the strength of the binding power as the iron tire cooled and contracted . New England thus became the nation 's center for many varieties  | of horse-drawn vehicles , as well as harness and saddles , and for that world-famous American breed , the remarkable Morgan horse , which came out of Vermont , and was ideal for the poor roads of the land . Americans of the early 1800s had to have genius . They were so few and powerless , and their environment was so hugely overpowering . There was so much to be done , and so little power available for doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovering and using labor-saving devices and methods . Some of the outmoded and forgotten devices and methods have been recaptured in words and pictures by Eric Sloane , the Connecticut artist , in such books as his American Barns and Covered Bridges , American Yesterday , Our Vanishing Landscape , and The Seasons of America Past . In his delightful Diary of an Early American Boy , he presented a plausible case for his contention that , however it may have begun elsewhere , here in America the era of canals was probably born in barnyards . Sloane 's studies of labor-saving methods used on pioneer farms led him to the conclusion that " it was the sluice-box that first gave American designers the idea for a canal . " The sluice-box originally was a long wooden box with water in it , and was used to enable people to move heavy loads from place to place by floating them on long narrow boats resembling the stoneboats used to slide such things as boulders over grass-covered earth . Such boxes were sometimes 1,000 feet long , he said . If longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ground . Such channels were used in a few places for irrigation in the 1700s , and by the end of that century , they were being used to float logs to mills and to carry sacked grain to mills on small flatboats . In the 1800s , the digging of canals was undertaken with near frenzy ; and , as the ditches were dug , and the craft that plied such waterways improved into comfortable conveyances , more and more travelers came from Europe to look at America and Americans . The crowning achievement of the canal era was the Erie canal . Its completion in 1825 provided an almost level waterway across the Appalachian barrier to the Great Lakes . What is perhaps more significant historically is that it enabled New York City to displace Philadelphia as the nation 's largest city and chief port . The slowmoving , less-expensive , freight-and-passenger " Line Boats " competed with the faster , more luxurious and expensive passenger-carrying " Canal Packets . " The impression nowadays is that tourists boarded a boat in Albany and remained on it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people alternated between canal boats and stage coaches to make better time . One anonymous traveler whose notes were published in a Philadelphia periodical in 1829- ' 30 , said  | that , though he had planned to take a canal boat out of Albany , he was dissuaded because it would take 24 hours to go through 40 locks in a distance of 28 miles , and that he took a stagecoach , of which more than 30 were then operating on a 15-mile turnpike to Schenectady . The fare was 62 cents , and he said he left Albany at 10 a.m. and reached Schenectady at about 1 p.m . As soon as the stagecoach came to a stop , the passengers were assailed by a clamor of competing agents for several packets " all anxious for us to engage our passage with them at almost any price we pleased . " Perhaps no other domestic event in the 19th century stirred Americans as deeply as the Erie Canal . The 363-mile ribbon of water from the Hudson to Lake Erie was a monument to American enterprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs of 83 locks , over a river on a 750-foot aqueduct , and in a mile long embankment across a valley . The whole nation celebrated when , on October 26 , 1825 , a fleet of canal boats led by the packet Seneca Chief , bearing Governor De Witt Clinton and distinguished guests , left Buffalo at the end of a rope pulled by four fine grays . Three years after the opening of the Canal , the annual Custom House receipts were enough to take care of the cost of running the federal government . The success of the Erie caused other communities to become concerned about trade with the west . As one fantastic result , the Pennsylvania Canal was opened in 1834 . It was a weird combination of canals , viaducts , tunnels , inclined planes , horse-drawn vehicles and steam locomotives . The most amazing thing about the ingenious combination is that , not long after it opened , it was as profitable as the Erie Canal . Part of our heritage from that time is the verb form , to ship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place by any means of transport but which we got from the canals that , built all over the eastern part of the United States in the 1800s , sealed the doom of many early roads , especially some of the privately constructed turnpikes which , though well constructed , were not too judiciously place . So , although they appear on maps of the early 1800s , the roads were not used unless no other ways were open . After rain , it was often better and safer to take to adjoining fields than to brave the ribbons of mud and water . As they had in the first two centuries of their settlement of the continent , Americans still preferred the waterways . Yet , though the canals began the doom of the roads , they also created roads . For a canal is , after all , a ditch ; and , in digging  | canals , the excavated earth was heaped up on one side as the berm and on the other side as a road for the draft animals that pulled the boats . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created . Indeed , some of the very best roads in the land before we began to build roads for automobiles in the 1920s , were formef tow-paths along old canals . So great was the fertility of the land opened up along the Ohio that , by Conestoga wagons over the mountains and by all sorts of boats south to New Orleans , a mounting flood of wealth in the form of products of those rich acres surged into the ports . Hogs multiplied like rabbits and most Ohio farms had hundreds of them . Runty cattle grew sleek and fat in the bluegrass and dropped calves as if on schedule . Chancellor Livingston had brought Merino sheep to America , and they throve . In 1805 George and Felix Renick went into Ohio to investigate the stories about the way meat animals multiplied and grew fat there . They went from farm to farm , buying beef cattle until they had about a thousand head . Herding them over the National Road to Baltimore , they were unable to contain their jubilation over having made a profit of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Road and all roads and trails leading to it in the west and all Eastern roads that forked off it were swarming with animals walking to market . Travelers in coaches could tell from far away that they were soon to be in for something unpleasant as they watched the dust billow up , often to obscure the sun . It was a sure sign they were soon to be engulfed by herds of beef cattle , great droves of hogs , flocks of sheep , or even poultry walking to market under the supervision of drovers and herders . The nature of travel in the 1800s is illustrated by the experiences of some of the more famous European visitors to the United States . Mrs. Frances Trollope of London , author of the famous Domestic Manners of the Americans , embarked from New Orleans on a steamboat on New Year 's Day , 1828 . She wrote : " The innumerable steamboats . . . are totally unlike any I had seen in Europe , and greatly superior to them . " Later she had some experience with American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit a friend 15 miles in the forest east of Memphis , she was horrified to have the vehicle in which she was riding sink so far into the mud that the driver had to help her onto the back of one of the horses and ride out of the " unhandsome fix . " Another day , she was carried along a road in the forest in a  | carriage that somehow managed not to impale itself on the stumps in the road . " It was amusing to watch the cool and easy skill with which the driver wound his horses and wheels among the stumps . " On a later trip , having traveled by steamboat from Baltimore to Philadelphia , she continued by road ; and , at Trenton , she wrote , " we left our smoothly-gliding comfortable boat for the most detestable stagecoach that ever Christian built to dislocate the joints of his fellowmen . " When Captain Frederick Marryatt , the famous British naval officer , landowner , editor and novelist , followed Mrs. Trollope 's excellent road only five years later , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , " is one of the best in America ; the 80 miles are performed in four hours and a half , stoppages for taking in water , passengers , and refreshments , included . " At Detroit , he wrote : " There is not a paved street in it , or even a footpath for a pedestrian . In winter , in rainy weather , you are up to your knees in mud ; in summer , invisible from dust ; indeed , until lately , there was not a practicable road for 30 miles around Detroit . " But the old French community was beginning to bulge at the seams as the tide of immigration swept in and through it . " Within the last six years , " he wrote , " it has increased its population from two to ten thousand . " Of one of those roads across Ontario , which was then still called Upper Canada , he said it was being repaired and leveled , " preparatory to being macadamized ? certainly not before it was required , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile or so you descend into a hollow , at the bottom of which is what they term a mud hole , that is , a certain quantity of water and mud , which is of a depth unknown , and which you must fathom by passing through it . To give an Englishman an idea of the roads is not easy ; I can only say that it is very possible for a horse to be drowned in one of their ruts , and for a pair of them to disappear , waggon and all , in a mud hole ... " On his way eastward over the National Road to Baltimore he had to travel six days and nights by coach . He learned that the expression , " I am stumped , " came from the frequency with which travelers found themselves suddenly stopped by a stump that proved to be too high for the passenger of carriage or coach . In the Midwest , where tolerable means of transport were not as abundant as in the East , the desperate need for improved roads led to importation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such roads seldom survived ten years .  | On the far side of the Rockies , a trickle of trappers had begun in 1811 when John Jacob Astor established Astoria , in the northwest corner of what is now Oregon , to carry on the fur trade that was to bring him his enormous fortune . By 1843 , the trickle had become the Great Migration over the lofty mountains and down the Columbia River . It was soon to make the Oregon Trail the western extension of the cross-continent road that began with the National Road in the East . It was in the far West , also , where two colorful experiments were accorded much attention . To speed communications to California , Jefferson Davis , as Secretary of War , imported in 1857 Arabian and Egyptian camels to carry messages between Albuquerque and Los Angeles , an experiment that failed because no competent camel drivers had been provided . Then , in 1860 , the short-lived Pony Express brought San Francisco closer to New York as the horsekilling young riders sped back and forth in the 18 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraph lines had been strung from coast to coast , thanks to the perfection , in New England , of methods for mass production of wire . In the 1850s , railways were becoming more common . The fastest trains were averaging about 25 miles an hour , and the locomotives were hauling longer and heavier trains of passengers and freight over long as well as short distances . Freighting companies that had long used Conestoga wagons , as well as stagecoach lines , were now failing fast ; and the roads , suffering more and more neglect , were muddy , rough , and well-nigh impassable . The waterways were still the best routes for passengers and freight , and the great American highways were still the Mississippi-OhioMissouri network and the Great Lakes . The falls and the rapids were the major obstacles . To meet this problem , the Welland Canal had been built in the mid-1820s between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario , bypassing Niagara Falls . And , in 1855 , a group of enterprising Vermonters and New Yorkers undertook to build the American part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lake Huron , as they had not been able to do because of the falls and rapids of Sault Sainte Marie . Though Henry Clay had voiced the sniffish opinion that the project would be about as useful as a canal on the moon , it turned the United States from an importer of iron to self-sufficiency , and just in time for the Civil War ; and became so heavily used that , in our own times , it was carrying more tonnage than the combined total of the Suez and Panama Canals .  | After the Civil War , the junction of the Union and Central Pacific railways at Promontory Point , Utah , marked the beginning of the dark age of American roads . Certainly nobody could have predicted what was to happen . The stirring days of the early 1800s when great roads were being planned and started , and then , in succession so rapid as to seem , in retrospect , almost simultaneous movements , the dramatic era of the canalbuilders , the spectacular golden age of steamboating , the thundering advent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and falling back to earth , almost all in a single century ? who could have foreseen it ? As the century drew to a close , some four million cyclists added their voices to the clamor for roads . They wanted something better than rivers of mud or ribbons of thick velvety dust . They wanted roadside guiding markers and intelligible maps . The railroads instituted campaigns to get better roads , to bring more people and more products to railway shipping points . The National Grange officially advocated better roads for its farmer members . The League of American Wheelmen was formed to get the cyclists of the land into a concerted drive for better roads . But , steadily and inexorably , the roads became worse . Who would have dared say , in 1800 , that , by 1900 , the roads of the land would be in such wretched state ? Who could have believed that they would be worse here at the end of the 19th century than they had been in England at the end of the 18th ?

"  | The automobile did not spring full-panoplied from any one mind . Though a thicket of myths has grown up about its so-called " inventors , " it was not invented ; it evolved . And , before and while it was evolving , other developments were bringing about conditions that were to make it more readily acceptable . First came tires . They were introduced in the latter years of the 19th century to equip vehicles such as buggies and bicycles with rims or tires which would serve as " portable roads " by cushioning the shocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the material from which they were made had its beginnings when the early Spanish found the Indians playing games that involved the use of balls that possessed seemingly magic properties because of the liveliness of the bounce . That material , they learned , was the smokecured milk-like sap of jungle trees and vines from which the Amazonian Indians also made syringes and shoes . That material , which the Indians called cahuchu , became caoutchouc , or what the English called rubber because it rubbed out pencil marks on paper . The Scottish Charles Macintosh discovered in the early 1800s that he could waterproof garments that were to bear his name by dissolving parings of caoutchouc in naphtha , which he obtained in the pro- cess of manufacturing illuminating gas at the Glasgow Gas Works . The instability of the waterproofing material ( it hardened in cold weather and softened into a sticky mess when warmed ) led to the successes of the American Charles Goodyear and the British Thomas Hancock in the process that came to be known as vulcanization , and that , in turn , led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Merrill Denison in The Power to Go , " the pneumatic tire appeared at the right moment . No invention had a more engaging inspiration . In Belfast , Ireland , a Scottish veterinary surgeon , John Boyd Dunlop , watched his young son ride his new bicycle around a cobble-stoned courtyard and decided that the wee bairn would surely shake himself to death on the ironrimmed wheels . To avoid this catastrophe , the good doctor wrapped pieces of rubber hose around the rims . And so great was the improvement that Dunlop went on to invent the pneumatic tire ? a cushion of air contained in a membrane of rubber . " Denison , concurring with an earlier opinion expressed by James Rood Doolittle , declared flatly , " Without the pneumatic tire , the automobile would have died a-borning . " Patented in 1889 , the pneumatic tire arrived just in time to put millions of people on rubber-tired wheels as the cycling craze swept over Europe , the British Isles and all of America . The function of the pneumatic tire as the vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment about the introduction of the balloon tire in the 1920s that " rolling on 70 pounds of air the most expensive car was incurably bumpy even on the best of roads , but on 32 to 34 pounds of air even the Model T Ford seemed to float over the roughest road . " The Dunlop accomplishment is not as clear-cut as it seems , for Andre and Edouard Michelin , in 1895 , built their own motorcar to demonstrate the worth of pneumatic tires . Meantime , while Dunlop and the Freres Michelin were working toward insulation of the vehicle from the shocks of poor pavement , others were seeking to improve the surfacing of streets and roads . Most city streets that had the benefit of pavement were paved with cobble-stones or the roughly squared granite Belgian blocks , both of which were rather inexpensive because they were freely used as ballast for ships . The boulevards of Paris , as well as the roads in parks elsewhere used by the carriages of royalty and people of wealth , were often smoothly surfaced with asphalt , either from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhone , or from the asphalt lake in Trinidad . Other streets were paved with brick , hand-laid by skilled pavers on cushions of sand and held in place  | with either tar or cement . Brick pavements were favored , especially on hills , because they provided better foothold for horses , which were usually shod for urban hauling with iron and steel shoes . In some places , creosoted and squared wooden blocks were used in place of the especially hard paving bricks . This kind of pavement , introduced first in Russia , tended to disintegrate when heavy rains caused flash-floods in streets . Elsewhere , round sections cut from cedar logs were placed on end in sand beds and held together with sand and tar binder . These , however , showed even greater tendency to disintegrate under flooded conditions . In Bellefontaine , Ohio , the first single-course concrete pavement in North America was laid in 1892 on a street around the courthouse . In Europe , the natural cement and lime that had been used in pavements since Roman times began to give way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventor , Joseph Aspdin , called portland cement because it resembled natural rock quarried on the Isle of Portland . The vast and mysterious lake of asphalt in the British West Indian Island of Trinidad provided the best roads for the automobile when that conveyance was in its frail and faltering infancy as a horseless carriage , and most in need of smooth pavement . And the place where it happened first in the United States was in the District of Columbia where , shortly after the Civil War , it became apparent that something would have to be done to put an end to the welldeserved ridicule which visitors , native as well as foreign , heaped on the nation 's capital until the proud boast about " a city of magnificent distances " had become a standard joke . Of Washington , D. C. in mid-century , Henry Adams wrote , " As in 1800 and 1850 , so in 1860 , the same rude colony was camped in the same forest , with the same unfinished Greek temples for workrooms , and sloughs for roads . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrayed the city in 1860 to 1865 as an almost unbelievably filthy community . South of the President 's House ( which was not the White House until Theodore Roosevelt called it that ) there was a malodorous swamp that had been an outlet for sewage . To reach the Mall and the southwest section of the city , one had to cross by iron bridges the town 's worst nuisance , the old city canal , once a waterway linking the Potomac and the Eastern Branch , but by then serving as an open sewer . The city 's main thoroughfare , Pennsylvania Avenue , though called " the " Avenue , was thus described by Miss Leech : " Devoid of fine buildings , the wide , neglected street wore an air of  | desolation . Its thin cobble pavement had been broken up by faulty drainage and the traffic of heavy omnibuses which plied between the Capitol and Georgetown . In dry weather , the ruts and hollows were iron traps , covered with thick dust . Rain turned the roadbed into a channel of mud , underlaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geese waddled on the Avenue , and hogs , of every size and color , roamed at large , making their muddy wallows on Capitol Hill and in Judiciary Square . People emptied slops and refuse in the gutters , and threw dead domestic animals into the canal . Most of the population still depended on the questionable water supply afforded by wells and by springs in the hills behind the city . Privies , in the absence of adequate sewage disposal , were plentiful in yards and dirty alleys . " The roads around Washington were much improved by the Army during the Civil War . Inside the city , however , the war years brought no improvement ; if anything , the increased traffic of wartime made the streets worse than they had been before . The man who was to change those conditions drastically for the better was graduated from Ohio 's Oberlin College in 1867 and moved to the nation 's capital that year to become a teacher at Howard University , the school for Negroes that had just been established there . He was a native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French ancestry , and his name was Amzi Lorenzo Barber . Like many other teachers , Barber had to find additional outside work to keep body and soul together . He was dealing in real estate when extensive street improvements planned for the District caused him to study asphalt as a paving material . Thus he learned of the mysterious black lake in Trinidad . Asphalt is a material with a long history . The name is Arabic . The ancient Egyptians preserved bodies of the dead by wrapping them in cloth impregnated with asphalt . The Babylonians used it in construction of irrigation systems . It was used in the Tower of Babel and as waterproofing for the basket in which the infant Moses was found . The Babylonians also used it together with brick to pave a road 600 years before Christ . And , as we noted earlier , the streets of Cordova were paved with it during the Moorish occupation of Spain . In 1877 , Barber obtained a franchise to take asphalt from the great pitch lake in Trinidad . A year later his paving company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothest . By 1884 , his paving company had a nation-wide monopoly of the Trinidad deposit , and by 1888 his Trinidad Asphalt Company had been  | formed to take over all leases on the deposit . By taking over from the British government all concessions covering the entire lake of 114 acres for a term of 42 years , he became the " Asphalt King " because he controlled this , the world 's chief source of the material for some 20-odd years . After Washington , Buffalo became the first large city in the land to use asphalt extensively for pavement of streets . Soon , other cities followed , and Washington 's beautifully smooth Pennsylvania Avenue had competitors in Manhattan 's Fifth Avenue and Broadway , Chicago 's Michigan Boulevard and San Francisco 's Market Street . Asphalt also was popular as pavement of roadways in city parks . In the first ten years of Barber 's paving career , more than 3,500 , - 000 square yards of asphalt pavement were laid in the United States . By 1896 there were 30 asphalt paving companies at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least half of the total pavement . From that seemingly inexhaustible deposit in Trinidad , 23,000 tons were taken out in 1880 . The output rose steadily , to 86,000 tons a year by 1895 , and to almost double that amount by the end of the century . At that point in time , asphalt from petroleum began to compete with the Trinidad product , and , in the ensuing years , the La Brea deposit at Los Angeles also became a factor in the competition . In recent years , however , Rancho La Brea became a public park because the asphalt pit was found to be a storehouse for the skeletal remains of extinct prehistoric animals . The great virtue of ' asphalt in the early years of this century was that its use as a topping for Europe 's macadam roads saved such roads from the destructive effect caused by the rapid passage of pneumatic-tired vehicles , which whirled the essential covering of rock dust aloft to be scattered abroad by the wind . For roads that had been macadamized , asphalt came to the rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads from destruction . Amid the torrent of nonsense that has been written about the automobile 's advent in America , you find the early arrivals on the scene often described as " snorting " and " bucking " and " undependable . " The fact of the matter is that most of the automobiles Americans saw in the 1890s neither snorted nor bucked ; and they were dependable because they were mostly electrics . They were mainly " for-hire " vehicles ? electric cabs , hansoms and victorias ? but they were not taxicabs ; the taximetre , a French-German invention , had not yet been perfected ; the word taxicab was not coined until 1907 . The electrics were popular because there were few places in America where a car could be used . In such places , the clean , silent  | elegance of an electric was just right . A lady could ride in one , or even drive one , and still look like a lady . So electrics were favored on Fifth Avenue , the Main Line , Beacon Hill , Lake Shore Drive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first closed cars were electrics , with beveled plate-glass windows , affording good visibility ? especially of the occupants . Diamond Jim Brady had one built : the first automobile known to have a curved windshield . It was well lighted inside to show off Lillian Russell and Jim 's fabulous diamonds . The car that carried President William McKinley to the hospital when he was shot at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in September , 1901 , was an electric ambulance . The first United States postage stamp to portray an automobile , a four-cent commemorative for that world 's fair in Buffalo , showed an electric brougham of the kind used as cabs in eastern cities in the 1890s . Those fleets were owned by the Electric Vehicle Company , known as the " Lead Cab Trust , " so called because half the weight of each automobile consisted of lead-acid batteries . But just when the " Trust " had it all figured out that electrics represented the " sure thing in this horseless-carriage game , " all the pretty schemes were blasted by two young men from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twins , born on a farm near Kingfield , Maine , in 1849 . They had little formal schooling but shared a natural flair for mathematics and remarkable skill as whittlers . They made a success as manufacturers of violins ; and , experimenting in photography in its infancy , produced a photographic dry plate , the rights to which they sold to the Eastman company for a handsome profit . At a county fair in Brockton , Massachusetts , in 1896 , they saw their first automobile . It was an imported French De Dion Bouton steamer and , having examined it carefully , they decided simultaneously that they could build a better one . Buying manufacturing rights to a steam automobile that had been designed by George D. Whitney of Providence , Rhode Island , they added refinements of their own until the prototype was unrecognizable . They drove it all over New England , usually at speeds that terrified all beholders . The Stanleys were besieged by financiers , but the twins protested that they were having too much fun to take on partners . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to sell their patents . More to get rid of him than anything else , they set a figure on manufacturing rights so exorbitant that they were sure they would scare him off . But , without a whimper , he paid what they asked : a quarter of a million dollars . With John Brisben Walker ,  | publisher of Cosmopolitan Magazine , as his partner , Barber organized a corporation that bought the Stanley patent rights and factory . Within a month Barber and Walker were at odds because each wanted to run the company , so they parted , each having equal rights to Stanley patents and each taking a twin as factory manager for a year . Walker took the name , Mobile Company of America , and built a new factory at Kingland Point , near Tarrytown , N. Y. , which was the first factory ever built in the United States expressly for production of automobiles . Barber called his share of the division the Locomobile Company of America , and took over the Stanley factory in Newton . The Mobile Company lasted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobiles and then changed over to gasoline vehicles in 1902 . After their year with Barber and Walker was up , the twins went to work on an improved steam automobile . They did away with the chain drive and geared their engine directly to the rear axle . The new Stanley Steamer was superior to any other automobile on the American scene . The Stanleys continued to make their famous Steamers long after the success of the gasoline automobile made Stanley Steamers seem ridiculous . The twins quite frankly did not care about changing styles . " We know there is more money in gas cars , " they said . " Just the same , steamers are a lot more fun . " First , electrics . Then , steamers . So the 19th century came to an end . Where was the gasoline automobile ? In the United States it was as hard to find as a stretch of good road , or , for that matter , a wellpaved city street . The fuel , as we know , was available , and had been around since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their terrifying fire-ships . We know , too , that Marco Polo saw the sources of " earth-oil " along the shores of the Caspian Sea more than 500 years before petroleum was discovered in Pennsylvania , and that its discovery at Titusville in the middle of the 19th century was actually a rediscovery of something that someone had noted on a map printed by Benjamin Franklin in the mid-1700s . When the discovery was made at Titusville , however , men 's interest in petroleum was confined to its possibilities as replacement for the lubricants and illuminants that had been supplied by whales before the great whaling fleets of Nantucket and New Bedford had been destroyed by Confederate raiders in the far Pacific . Petroleum refining processes , derived from whiskey distilling methods perfected  | New Haven , he said , " I imagine I saw it not so very different from what it was in Washington 's day . It was originally a straight line .. . The old Colonial stagecoach route . . . must have been laid out with a compass . . . Originally it wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fences . " However , the actual road was a single crooked carriage trail . From Hartford to Berlin , about ten miles , the going was good . Beyond that point , Maxim had road information good only for cyclists . How inadequate such information was for motorists , he and his traveling companion were about to find out ; for , where the road was bad , cyclists had made a path for themselves around the bad spot on the high ground , and where it was very bad , they either took to the nearest railroad tracks to ride on the right-of-way , or they walked across fields pushing their cycles . From his account of conditions , it appears that this road had now become , if anything , even worse than anything Madam Knight had encountered in her journey over it almost two centuries earlier . There was no long distance travel on this once famous road then , he declared . It was used only for local travel . Beyond Wallingford , for example , they ran into a stretch of soft sand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . But they managed to get through it somehow , though it took them half a day to get to New Haven , which was only a third of the way to New York . Beyond New Haven they took a wrong turn and wound up in Milford . There were , of course , no road markings of any kind . They retraced their way , reached Bridgeport in mid-afternoon , and Stamford after dark . At that point , Maxim 's companion said he had had it ? all he could take of it ; he left him to take a train to New York . Late that night , Maxim said , " the road changed from execrable macadam to worse cobblestones . " He bumped along as carefully as he could , hoping the fragile machine would hold together a little longer . And , after what he declared was one of the most discouraging rides he had ever taken , he added , " I came to the bridge over the Harlem , a happy sight indeed , for it promised asphalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late Isabel Paterson showed how ; in an economy in which individual initiative and human enterprise are truly free , accumulated private fortunes contribute to the process whereby products , that come on the market as expensive luxuries for the wealthy few , tend more and more to drift within reach of everyone , and thus come to be regarded as necessities . David L. Cohn summed it up in his Combustion on Wheels : " At a time when the United States had neither an automobile  | industry nor good roads , the importation of cars by the Newport colony brought this radical mechanical innovation to the attention of the American public , who at first looked upon it as a toy of the rich with little utilitarian appeal for the plain people . But since newspapers and magazines devoted a great deal of space to reporting the vagaries , activities , and scandals of the fashionable wealthy , their expensive , imported cars were brought more and more to the attention of the public , and many a member of the rising middle class came to want one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer the seats of the mighty . Thus , quite unwittingly , the Newport colony played a part in introducing the automobile to the United States and bringing about its general acceptance by the whole people . " The Gasoline Age was dawning as the new century began . Just a decade after the Census Bureau had declared the American frontier closed , another frontier was opening . All it needed was roads ; and , before long , the new Vehicle would shape the new Way .  | In 1904 , the Office of Public Roads , of the Department of Agriculture , successor of the Federal Office of Road Inquiry , which had been established in 1897 , took the first census of American roads . We then had 2,151,570 miles of rural roads in the United States . But , of the impressive total , only 153,662 miles were " improved . " How improved ? Gravel had been spread on 108,233 miles of mud . Stone had been incorporated into 38,622 miles , to form the kind of roadway known as water-bound macadam . A little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shells , sand-clay , planks , and so on . Of pavement beyond city limits there was , in this entire vast land , only 141 miles . The rest was mostly wagon tracks through the weeds . The greater part of those 141 paved miles were in Ohio and West Virginia , where brick pavements had been built , mostly with convict labor . Of the 18 miles of bituminous pavement in the country , 16 were in Ohio and two in Massachusetts . Ohio also had 13 miles of bituminous macadam . California was then experimenting widely with oiled earth roads , and had built 18 miles of petrolithic pavement . In addition to those two miles of bituminous macadem , Massa- chusetts had three miles of asphalt , and two miles of tar treated earth and gravel . And that was it . All of it ! Nineteen-hundred four was the end of an era , according to the late Thomas H. MacDonald , long-time Commissioner of the Bureau of Public Roads . To the American Society of Civil Engineers he said in 1926 : " Up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of road construction . Either of the major types of surfacing ? gravel or macadam ? was known to give entire satisfaction under the traffic normal to the country roads of the time . " Until then , he added , the only type of traffic on country roads had been relatively light vehicles , horse-drawn and with steel tires . In and immediately around cities there had been considerable bicycle traffic since the 1880s , and a small number of automobiles , mostly confined to the cities , had begun to appear at the turn of the century . Now , however , the automobiles began to go into the country , and their speed , added to the cushioning effect of pneumatic tires , created swirling air currents that sucked up the binder from water-bound macadam and whirled it aloft in clouds of dust . When you realize what motoring was like in 1904 you wonder why Americans called their automobiles " pleasure cars . " That summer the song young folks sang was " Bedelia . " The young men , home from college , tinkled accompaniments on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come , " and " Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm . " When the talk turned serious , it was likely to be about Teddy 's bid for re-election , or perhaps the Russo-Japanese War . But , wherever they gathered , there was sure to be talk about the wonders to be seen at Saint Louis , where the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase was being celebrated . Before 1904 had run out , more than 20 million came , met , and viewed with awe an exposition that cost $31 million , or about twice the price of the whole Louisiana Purchase . They traipsed through the Palace of Education , the Palace of Electricity , saw Queen Victoria 's Diamond Jubilee gifts , a copy of the Grand Trianon at Versailles , a walled city from the Philippines , a Siamese temple , and they gaped at such modern marvels as the telephone , the wireless telegraph , a working steel smelter , and , most exciting of all , automobiles . That spring someone got the bright idea that it would be a brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World 's Fair , to arrive together for a parade . Why not ? There were 55,000 motor vehicles then registered in the country , and that was 50,000 more than there had been five years before . ( That there would be 100  | million only 65 years later was unthinkable . ) At the moment , though , that 55,000 loomed large , and there was hopeful talk that maybe as many as 2,500 would turn out for such a tour . This was to be a junket for motorists , not a contest for car manufacturers ; so , the automobile clubs of several cities initiated the planning at the suggestions of members . Thus the American Automobile Association , which had held its first board meeting at the club house of the Automobile Club of America in New York City in 1903 , was asked to supervise the affair through a set of committees . As general chairman of the " pilgrimage , " as they now began to call it , they chose Colonel Augustus Post , that bearded crusader who had been an ardent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Waverly Electric in Central Park in 1898 , when the use of automobiles in parks was banned by statute in such American cities as New York , Chicago and Boston . Colonel Post was subsequently also a balloonist and an " early-bird " aviator . Since automobiles then had neither tops nor windshields , touring was a fair-weather pastime . Since they also had mainly kerosene carriage lamps , with a few daring innovators using messy and explosive acetylene gas generators and headlamps , touring was confined to daylight hours . It was idiotic to venture out alone beyond the ends of city pavements , where there were no roads , no guiding roadside signs , no garages , no filling stations . There were not even road maps . Planning had therefore to be elaborate ; motorists had to tour in packs , in order to help one another . For this tour , then , all pilgrims had to have starting dates and assembly points assigned to them . Detailed instructions , marked maps , showing routes , towns where they might stop for lunch , and hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be prepared and mailed . All timing was planned so that daily drives were to be about 100 miles . New Yorkers were to leave on July 25 , and stop overnight at Poughkeepsie , Albany , Syracuse and Rochester . This enabled New Englanders to leave the same day from Boston and , after a night stop at Springfield , join the New Yorkers at Albany . A Southern contingent planned to start from Baltimore on the 26th and travel over that ancient cowpath , the National Road . They were to be joined at overnight stops by others coming from New Jersey and Philadelphia , and were to have the option of striking northwest to join others at Cleveland . Columbus and Indianapolis were additional assembly points ; Chicago was to be the start for tourists from Iowa , Minnesota and Wisconsin ; still others from the West and Southwest , were to assemble at Kansas City . Committees were set up in all cities along the routes , to arrange for care of the tourists and  | their machines , prepare route cards and maps , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had by then completed an inspection tour of the route from New York to Saint Louis over the northern leg and the return route by way of the National Road . He was happy to report in a bulletin that he had found three more garages along the way , in Ohio , and that the roads were fair except some bad stretches in Illinois , near Syracuse , New York , and around York , Pennsylvania . From Chicago came a report that Frank X. Mudd , the committee chairman there , had solved the problem of marking the roads . He had rigged two pathfinder cars with " three-inch metal tubes , from the tonneau of the machine to within eight inches of the ground , ending in a funnel at the top , through which I expect my men to deposit one ounce of chopped paper directly on the route every 300 yards , except at turns , where there will be one ounce every 100 yards . " By the end of June there were reports of large delegations planning to join at Chicago , Toledo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West were given routes that followed the Santa Fe , Rock Island , Burlington , or Union Pacific railroads ; for , as was then customary , if roads became impassable , or if the trail just vanished as it often did in the West , one headed for the rails and bounced along on the ties until the springs broke , the axles bent , all the tires exploded , or a train contended for the right-of-way . By the Fourth of July , with only 20 days to go , there were not 2,500 entries , as had been optimistically predicted initially . There were not 1,000 , as the more reasonable had hoped for . Indeed , no adding machine was needed ; there were only 34 entries . Hopes were still high , though ; at least 250 more had promised to enter somewhere along the way . On July 25th , there was a crowd outside the mansion of Cornelius Vanderbilt at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street in New York , where the cars began lining up long before daybreak . At 8:30 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars were ready . Four were steamers , only two bore names that are still familiar : a single cylinder 8-hp Oldsmobile and an 81/a - hp Cadillac . So began the first successful automobile tour of a kind which , before World War I , was to be one of the marvels of each drowsy American summer . An inventory of one car 's contents indicates what the instructions meant by " spare parts . " In addition to four extra tires , it carried spare intake and outlet valves and springs , spark plugs and coils , anti-skid chains and tire-boots , extra fan-belt and drive-chain links , tire repair kit , air pump for filling tires up to 100 pounds pressure ,  | inner tubes , patches and rubber cement , cup grease , extra oil and gasoline in cans , boxes of bolts , screws , nuts and cotter pins , rolls of wire and coils of rope . Besides the rubber cover for the car , there were ponchos for the occupants . A well-stocked hamper of provisions competed for space with the big tool-box , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Drivers and passengers shoe-horned themselves in among this stuff as the cars shook themselves into motion , and the great hegira was on . There were all manner of people in the cars : society folk , chauffeurs , manufacturers of cars , and just plain people who wanted to go to the fair and have a good time en route . Though the day was perfect and the road fair , the last of the pilgrims limped into Poughkeepsie as late as 7:25 o'clock . John Van Benschoten , whose garage at 56 Catherine Street was one of the first in the land , was a busy man that night . A Peerless had lost a fanbelt , a White had to have a new water-pump , a Yale had wrecked its carburetor in collision with a dog , a Buckmobile had flipped off its drive-chains time after time all day long , a Haynes-Apperson and an Elmore had had oiling troubles , and several others had to have tire repairs . All this , at the end of only the first 76 miles ! Several dogs had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to warn everyone that night about speeding . At eight next morning , when they lined up at the Nelson House , it began to rain . At the edge of town the road was a bog in which they wallowed for miles . Soon the sun came out , and the pilgrims cheered when they came upon a stretch of road that had not been rained on . At Shodack Center , where the New York and Boston roads to Albany joined , the Albany welcoming committee met them with pathfinder cars . The confetti trail was laid and farmers along the route were asked to hang out lighted lanterns to guide those who came along after sundown . Next morning they were up early ; for , on this day , they had a hundred miles to go . So many springs were broken that day that they drafted a letter of complaint about the roads and sent it to Benjamin B. Odell , New York 's governor . A Pope-Hartford had gone out of control in the ruts and had plunged into a gully , - bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely dropping into a hole in the road ; a Franklin 's engine had to be taken apart and cleaned because gritty mud had worked into its interior and was scoring the bearing surfaces . A big Peerless , creeping through the morass in the rain and dark , had slithered into a deep ravine from which it was extricated only after three hours of labor with teams of horses , block and tackle , and a house-mover 's jacks and skids .  | Charles J. Glidden , who had joined the tour with the New England delegation declared flatly that he had never encountered worse roads anywhere in the world . The rotund Mr. Glidden knew a good deal about roads ; accompanied by Mrs. Glidden , he had in the past three years driven his English Napier a total of 17,782 miles in 17 countries . Next morning the sun was bright , but the previous day 's rain had wrought so much havoc with the roads that an alternate route to Rochester had to be marked with confetti . When they began to straggle into the Powers House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as their cars , were caked with mud . The waiting crowds guffawed , but the tourists were not amused . So many had had to wind their wheels with rope to get traction in the mud that farmers along the road had done a booming business selling them clotheslines . Saturday morning they were off at five . The roads were the best encountered so far , and the 73-mile run soon developed into a race . Some reached Buffalo as early as 9:30 . They took their cars to a garage on Franklin Street , and themselves to the Iroquois Hotel for baths and a well-earned week-end rest . They had now come 454 miles and had 804 miles still to go . Over the weekend they began to talk hopefully of how annual tours of this kind might stimulate interest in getting some roads built . Upshot of such talk , much of it in the Iroquois Hotel bar , was that two Boston newspapermen , Jack Kerrison , then of the Herald but later of the Post , and James T. Sullivan , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the notion of putting up money for a trophy to be awarded annually to the owner-driver of whatever car should set the best record on a carefully organized tour of not less than a thousand miles . Glidden took up the suggestion and established the famous trophy for the Glidden Tours that were run annually thereafter . In Buffalo , a few of the pilgrims quit , and a few more started . Monday was clear . They reached Cleveland , and huge crowds welcomed them at the Hollenden House , for that city was then showing great promise of becoming the nation 's chief automobile manufacturing center . Most of them had made the 110-mile run in less than five hours . Wednesday brought them another nice day . Because the run to Toledo was to be 121 miles , the longest so far , some were up and away as early as four . The road to Norwalk was atrocious . At one point the edge of the road gave way under a little Jeffery Rambler , and car and occupants were hurled into a gully . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rods , and blow-outs.  | Waterloo , Indiana , was next , and then South Bend , where many motorists had come from Chicago to escort the tourists to the Windy City on Saturday . They brought warnings of vast stretches of soft sand in the Indiana dune country ahead , and some cars were lightened by having their passengers and luggage go by rail . The plan called for assembly on arrival in Chicago at the German building , in Jackson Park , left over from the Columbian Exposition a decade earlier ; and then a drive downtown to the Auditorium Annex in an orderly procession . But such violent argument broke out in the Park over the proper order of precedence that Glidden , his great patience stretched to the limit , announced that if any of them wanted to persist in acting like barbarians , he 'd give them all the competition they wanted , and more , by forfeiting his certificate then and there , and starting on a non-stop race to Saint Louis . That cooled even the most ardent . Deciding to act like gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 cars in line when they reached the Loop . After a pleasant weekend in Chicago , they covered the stretches to Pontiac ; then on to Springfield ; and now they were ready for the last leg . It turned out to be an endurance contest . A cloudburst lashed across the prairie south of Litchfield in the morning , and the last 40 miles of the 105-mile run became an ordeal that paled everything that anyone had encountered up to now . The plowed fields actually looked better than the roads , and some of them took to those fields . The sticky mud ranged from six inches to mule-belly deep . Many had to get out and push , haul , pry with fencerails , and strain with ropes and block and tackle . Farmers that day learned how to augment income by hauling city slickers out of mudholes , an activity that was so profitable that it soon became commonplace in rural areas for farmers to create convenient mud-holes and keep stout teams harnessed and ready for the unwary motorist . One by one they straggled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come over the National Road had harrowing tales to tell of how they had had to tie logs behind their cars to assist their brakes in coming down some of the grades in the Appalachians . At 4 o'clock , Colonel Post gave the signal for them to start crossing Eads bridge . Now they counted noses . The brave expectations of 2,500 of the initial plan had dwindled to 108 who had registered . Of these , only 70 had reached official starting points , and only 58 got to Saint Louis . The longest drive had been the 1,264-mile run from Boston . It had taken 17 days . At Saint Louis Glidden presented the Glidden Cup to the Ameri- to get publicity for an idea he considered good , he wanted nothing to do with any scheme to glorify him . He rejected Batchelder 's suggestion thus : " Right now I think is a good time to pull out personally and take away . . . the idea that this road plan is mine . If any noise is made for any person or small clique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Before long he was hopefully contemplating the possibility of raising as much as a hundred million dollars for the project , and he was then joined by Packard Motor Car Company 's Alvan Macauley and Col. Sidney D. Waldon ; by Hudson Motor Car Company 's Roy D. Chapin , and by the Willys-Overland Company 's George W. Bennett . Henry Ford and James Couzens flatly refused to have anything to do with the scheme , although they were approached by Senator Albert J. Beveridge , Thomas A. Edison , President William Howard Taft and Vice President Charles Warren Fairbanks . Henry Ford 's only son , Edsel Bryant Ford , became a contributor , however . By the end of 1912 , Henry Bourne Joy , founder-president of Packard Motor Car Company , became one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the plan . In early 1913 motor clubs and chambers of commerce began sending in contributions . Then , in March , 1913 , came an offer from an unexpected quarter : A. W. Gowen , president of Lehigh Portland Cement Company , wrote a letter saying he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million barrels of cement for this road . In April , 1913 , at a meeting in Henry Joy 's office in Detroit , plans were drawn up for an organization to raise funds by popular subscription , publicize the project , and have general supervision of the business of getting the road planned and built . At this session it was determined that the name of Abraham Lincoln be somehow used in connection with the highway and the organization . Elbert Hubbard had proposed calling it " The American Road , " but , when he was overruled , had offered " Lincoln Memorial Highway " instead . Thus began the sometimes confusingly involved story of the Lincoln Highway . All that really needs to be stressed is that it was the excitement engendered by this plan that began to pull the American people out of the mud . True , the Lincoln Highway Association never succeeded in getting that one coast-to-coast road built . But , as Henry Joy put it , " What we really had in mind was not to build a road but to procure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . We knew that a real road across the country would have to come ; our problem was to get steam behind the idea . " An early document of the Association describes the Lincoln High- way as " nothing but a red line on a map . " Because the famous route has been lost in the numbering of national roads , there may be some reader interest in tracing that " red line . " It ran from New York to Jersey City , there being then only a ferry connection between the two . It then went to Philadelphia , following the Old Plank Road , laid out by the Dutch prior to 1675 to link New Amsterdam with settlements on the Delaware River . Part of that route had been regularly traveled since 1664 ; that is , the part from " Elizabethtown Point " ( Elizabeth ) to " Indian 's Ferry " ( New Brunswick ) and thence to " Falls-of-the Delaware " ( Trenton ) . There had been a ferry across the Raritan at New Brunswick as early as 1696 . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburgh because it offered more direct connections to Washington . From Paoli to Lancaster , it followed the old Lancaster Turnpike , which in turn had been the successor of the Conestoga Road begun in 1683 . From Lancaster to the Susquehanna , another old turnpike was followed . Beyond the Susquehanna it followed other old trails to York , Gettysburg , Chambersburg , McConnellsburg , and through the mountains to Bedford , Jennerstown , Ligonier , Greensburg , Pittsburgh , to the Ohio boundary near East Liverpool . It was the route later followed by US 30 . Across Ohio it followed the Ridge Road , which had been an Indian trail before the white man came . It was chosen because it was the easiest route across the state . It took the route to Fort Wayne , and thence across northern Indiana . Significantly , as early as this , the planners avoided Chicago because " it was desirable to keep through traffic out of the congestion of cities . " Instead , they picked up the old Overland Trail at Geneva . They crossed the Mississippi via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Omaha because that route was most directly in line with the Great South Pass . From Omaha west topography dictated the route . The route went up the Platte Valley as the wagon trains of the western emigrants had gone . Then the road went to Salt Lake City and south of Great Salt Lake to Ely , and from there west the position of the passes through the Sierra Nevada Range dictated the route through Reno , around Lake Tahoe , to Sacramento and San Francisco , partly over the old route of the Overland Stages . As soon as the map was published , the clamor began for diversion of the route elsewhere , and Henry Joy had to make a series of speeches to explain the purpose of the project and the reasons for choosing the route .  | But , contributions began to pour in , some of them just a few cents , and some from as far away as Alaska , Hawaii and England . The contributions in cash , materials , equipment , advertising space , and so on , ran into millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparsity of population made it useless to hope for construction of roads by public agencies , stretches of road were actually built and paid for by contributing companies and individuals . But the single most important contribution was the stirring of the people 's imagination that the planning and advertising of the road induced . In scores of communities , from cities to hamlets , the citizens rallied to the task of building what were called " seedling miles " of pavement beyond the city limits . It was on such " seedling miles " that many farmers saw for themselves the advantage of transporting their produce to market over smooth roads rather than behind straining beasts floundering in the mud . To show how Fisher 's emphasis on those " seedling miles " captured and held attention , the State of Iowa 's experience with attempts at road-improvement provides a good illustration . To old-timers in Iowa , U.S. 30 , which enters the State in the East at Clinton and passes over to Nebraska at Council Bluffs , is still " the Lincoln Highway . " Such old-timers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of road from Jersey City to San Francisco which was hopefully referred to as " Main Street of the U.S.A. " Iowa was known , among early motorists as perhaps the muddiest of all states . Its roads were established along section lines , but there was no definite system of roads , either state or county . All responsibility reposed in officials in the townships and counties , and those officials , naturally , were not much interested in anything outside of their own bailiwicks . The excitement generated by those " seedling miles " provided the initial heave of the long pull that lifted Iowa out of the mud . It gave impetus to organizations of women , business men , and many civicminded people of all walks of life , who , clamoring for good roads , directed their assaults against the county boards in charge of roads . There were some small attainments , such as a load of gravel dumped into some particularly bad mudhole , and an occasional elevated grade . But no actual pavement was laid except in a few cities and villages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of Main Street the pavement ended abruptly ; in spring , and after every heavy rain , every road was a maze of deep ruts running from mudhole to mudhole ; in summer , the movement of every vehicle added its share to the pall of dust that hung in the motionless air above each road .  | Then , in 1913 , the Iowa General Assembly created a Highway Commission independent of the State College . As its chief engineer , the new commission chose Thomas A. MacDonald who had been secretary-and-engineer of the advisory body since 1904 . His name was to become the most famous in American highway history ; for , from Iowa , he moved to Washington later to shape and guide the Bureau of Public Roads . In his 34 years of service to that federal body , he was to become so well known as " the Chief " that , among roadbuilders everywhere in the world , no other designation was needed to identify him . The Iowa Road Law of 1913 authorized the new Commission to help counties establish official road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were 104,082 miles of road outside of cities and towns , and 8,422 miles within them . By February 1914 , for the first time , lists of roads , and maps of each county 's system could be printed . The Commission was empowered to assist in improvement of almost 16,000 miles of those roads , and to use convict labor for the work . It also established a precedent by encouraging women to concern themselves about road improvement . The Iowa Federation of Women 's Clubs prepared a study course based on the Road Law of 1913 , and texts provided by the new Commission . One of the conditions then commonplace , which now seems preposterous , was the total lack of road markings , such as mileage markers , direction signs and identification numbers . Carl Fisher dramatized that lack with a story from his own rich experience . " Three of us , " he said , " drove out nine miles from Indianapolis . We were overtaken by darkness before we could return , and then it started to rain . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None could remember which way we had come . We could see no lights from the city . We could n't read the sign posted at the fork . All that was left was for one of us to climb the pole and try to get close enough to the sign to read it . We matched to see who should climb . I lost . I was half way up the pole when I remembered my matches were inside my coat and I could n't reach them . So down I had to come , dig out the matches , put them into my hat and climb again . I got to the sign , scratched a match , and before the wind and the rain put it out was able to read : Chew Battle Axe Cut Plug . " Here , the women decided , was a job that needed doing , and at costs that should not be too great to be objectionable . So they helped get certain route markings approved : The Great White Way , 338 miles from Muscatine to Council Bluffs , marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muscatine to Cedar Rapids ; and the Lincoln Highway which , by the end of 1914 , was being marked from the eastern to the western state line with the official symbol , a capital L in a diamond , centered in the broad white stripe flanked by a red and a blue stripe painted around utility poles . Iowa was not the first state to get a " seedling mile . " The first one was in Illinois , near Malta , begun in October 1914 . Nor was the first piece of rural concrete pavement in Iowa a " seedling mile . " But it did get one , in 1918 . The Lincoln Highway Association stipulated that a " seedling mile " had to be six miles from the nearest city . That stipulation stemmed from the belief that , if such a mile of good pavement should be laid , public pressure would build up to get connecting miles filled in . As a writer in the Ames Daily Tribune put it on the occasion of the Iowa State Highway Commission 's 50th birthday celebration in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , isolated and alone , yet big with the very idea of it , carrying within its 16-foot width the magic of the dreams of those early good roads boosters . " Although he was " the show-off " in Indianapolis , Carl Fisher showed how little he merited the term by the vehemence with which he resisted all efforts to name the highway , or portions of it , in his honor . In only one section was his adamant resistance unsuccessful : Fisher Pass , in Utah , was named for him because it would not have been finished without his contribution of $25,000 . Long before actual work on the Lincoln Highway began , his wife , Jane Fisher , recalled , " Carl had said that the United States would never be content with the building of this single road . " He was right . In the decade after dedication of this one route , nearly a hundred highway organizations had sprung up in this country , each bent on getting one particular stretch of highway . built .  | It was the late Charles Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution of the automobile in the 1890s and the early 1900s was shaped by the roadlessness of the land . King , who built and ran in 1896 the first motor vehicle in Detroit , pointed out that America 's earliest vehicles were all motorized wagons and buggies . His own first vehicle was a wagon which a Cincinnati firm had tried unsuccessfully to motorize and had then sent to him . The Duryea brothers also motorized wagons . The curved-dash Oldsmobile runabout was merely a small buggy without a ' top . It was quite obviously a fair-weather vehicle ; it did not even have what would now be called fenders but were then called mudguards , and the man who noted that lack went into business to supply the need and thereby founded a successful enterprise and a fortune . Though these early vehicles were motorized buggies and wagons , they were pretty much limited in use to cities where there was some asphalt pavement . Even brick pavement was hard on them , and cobblestone , the most prevalent type , was disastrous . If you examine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will notice that , around 1901 , American designers strove  | to copy European automobiles . King , who was chief engineer of the Olds Works , recalled : " We all tried to copy the European , " he said , " but their roads were not our roads , so we had to stop imitating and begin inventing . Even the British , though they were late in getting that foolish Red Flag Law repealed , had an advantage over us because their roads were better . " Though we needed motor vehicles in this vast and sparsely settled land much more than they were needed in Europe , there seemed to be little likelihood , until the second decade of the century , that we would ever be able to use them save in the cities . Then , oddly enough , as David L. Cohn pointed out in his Combustion on Wheels , the change , when it came , was supported by the most cautious and conservative groups in our country : the country doctors and the farmers . It was the country doctor who first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool of the profession , in the United States . And , although country doctors and most general practitioners were notoriously slipshod about their bookkeeping , they kept records of costs and performances of their cars with such scrupulous accuracy that , in April 1906 , The Journal of the American Medical Association could publish a special section entitled " Automobiles for Physicians " which contained so many doctors ' accurate comparisons between cars and horse-drawn vehicles as tools of their profession that virtually all we now know about comparative costs of that era is derived from it . The doctor 's early exploration of the car 's usefulness no doubt stemmed from the fact that he , more than most , measured values in terms of time . Minutes meant the difference between life and death . The fanner was next to accept the worth of the automobile as tool ; for , like the country doctor , his appraisal of values was often in terms of time rather than money . For example , to have a crop of oats for his horses next winter , the plowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible in the spring , but could be done only when the earth crumbled rather than lumped in the hand . The critical period was often a matter , not of days , but hours . If , therefore , there was breakage of some needed piece of equipment in that critical period , and too great a delay in getting repairs or replacement from town , it could easily mean the loss of a crop for that year . So , because he was almost as time-conscious as the country doctor , the conservative , hard-to-convince farmer began to react favorably to  | the campaign for road improvement which the National Grange inaugurated in 1907 . So , between them , the country doctor and the farmer were perhaps most responsible for the great popularity of Henry Ford 's Model T , and the consequent popular acceptance of the good-roads program which that homely but very efficient and uniquely American motor vehicle did so much to stimulate as it became a commonplace on the rural byways of America . One thing that helped Henry Ford greatly was vanadium alloy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help a small steelmaker in Canton , Ohio , to make it for the first time in this country . With this , and other alloy steels , he and his associates were able to design the vehicle so that parts subjected to great stresses and shocks could be made without the usual burdens of excess bulk and weight . When he unveiled it , some of his backers recoiled in horror , for it had no glamor whatever . He had to explain his theory : make this one model and nothing else , concentrate all effort on it , change it only to improve it , divide and subdivide and thus simplify the labor required to produce it ; and , by doing all these things , lower the costs and the price . He had to fight for his ideas ; but , since the shareholders were few , his ultimatum , " Take it or leave it ! " could be effective . His control was a bit easier when some faint-hearted ones did leave , and , as Roger Burlingame wrote in Backgrounds of Power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellows who stayed become multi-millionaires . " Model T , the beloved Tin Lizzie , high-slung , gauche ( it even steered from the left ) , was homely but dependable , almost indestructible , and unforgettable . In 1909 , the first full production year , the factory turned out 10,609 , which was about one-twelfth of the U.S. total . In 1910 , Model T accounted for about one tenth of the nation 's total output of motor vehicles ; by 1913 it was more than a third . Model T changed the face of the land . It pulled America out of the mud . It transformed a people . By 1930 , half-grown boys had more mechanical know-how than most skilled mechanics of 1910 . In 1910 , mechanical skill meant knowledge of how to use machines ; by 1930 , it meant knowledge of how to make them . In My Years with General Motors , Alfred P. Sloan , Jr. , said : " In twenty years the reliability of the motorcar was pretty well established . Individual mechanized transportation , one of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of life , and everyone could enjoy it . " Mr. Sloan noted how development and use of the vehicle had increased enormously the demands for better highways and , added :  | " It is hard to imagine what effect roads such as those of today might have had on the development of the automobile of the early 1920s . " Truck development lagged behind that of the passenger vehicle , but , became important in the war of 1914-1918 , and even more important to the building of roads in the United States afterwards . One of the early truck-building companies was headed , by Edward Ringwood Hewitt , Peter Cooper 's grandson , who had designed tenton trucks for hauling coal and iron as early as 1905 . He has a niche in roadbuilding history because he also built for Standard Oil some special tank trucks equipped with gear that made them serve as road-oilers . A New York outlet was established for a fine precision-built truck , the Saurer , designed and built in Switzerland by and for a firm that made machinery for textile mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent across the land for the first transcontinental tour by truck . It weighed seven tons loaded , and its load was mostly lumber with which its four-man crew could build bridges where there were none and then dismantle them , and create plank roads through sand and mud and then retrieve the planks . The rigors of the tour may be imagined from the fact that it took 36 days for the 1500 miles from Denver to Los Angeles . The record of that truck 's experience also provides good reasons for military neglect of the truck as carrier . Yet , in that same year , the United States Army began experimenting with trucks , especially those all-wheel-drive vehicles which were devised for use in mud and sand . In 1912 , the Army put 11 different makes of trucks through a cross-country test from Washington , D .. C. , to Atlanta , Georgia , and then to Sparta , Wisconsin . The only vehicle to finish was an allwheel-drive truck . The Army report approved it as " the only truck that might be considered for use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . The whole thing was apparently filed and forgotten . The federal government had been interested in roads in the early years of the republic because it had then seemed all too likely that , without roads , the people filling up the wilderness west of the Appalachian barrier would tend to drift away from the Union along the Atlantic littoral and gravitate toward New Orleans , the French port city at the end of their handy system of waterways . With the coming of steam-power for transport on land and water , the central government 's interest faded . Largely due to pressures from cyclists , especially through The League of American Wheelmen , new interest in highways was shown by Washington in 1893 . On  | March 3 of that year , the Congress established the United States Office of Road Inquiry . As the name indicates , it was a relatively powerless body . It had a budget of $10,000 to assist agricultural colleges and experiment stations in the study of construction and administration of road systems . The several states tried to do what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counties to issue bonds for construction of roads and authorizing them to assess abutting property-owners for a third of the cost of road improvement . Then , in 1891 and 1892 , New Jersey went a step further by authorizing the state to aid the counties in road construction , putting the State Board of Agriculture in charge of such aid . This , however , was not satisfactory , and , in 1894 , New Jersey led the way in the nation by creating a State Commissioner of Public Roads . Other states joined the procession , although it was not until 1917 that all states had state aid programs , and not until 1921 that they all had state highway systems . Meanwhile , in the early years of this century , more and more bills had been introduced into Congress with intent to make the federal government an active participant in highway construction . From about 1907 on , more of the proposed legislation was initiated with a desire to aid farmers in getting their produce to market . Increasing use of motor vehicles in rural areas was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , were active with campaigns and traveling exhibits intended to show farmers the worth of having good all-weather roads as feeder-lines for railway connections . In 1912 alone , some 60 bills were introduced in Congress calling for federal monetary aid ; but , despite the clamor , Congress appropriated only the modest sum of $500,000 for highway construction as part of the Post Office Appropriation Act , and that money was limlited to grants to only such states as were willing to pay two-thirds of the cost . In all , 17 states took advantage of it , and a total of 425 miles of improvement resulted . A joint Congressional Committee was appointed at the same time to determine if and how federal funds could be used to aid highway construction . The report of that body , in 1915 , resulted in passage of the Shackleford Good Roads Bill which was signed by President Woodrow Wilson on 11 July 1916 . The Committee 's report said that federal aid to states for roads would accomplish some of the objectives sought by the framers of the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , above all , promote the general welfare . The debate which had gone on for a century between advocates of states ' rights and of  | federalism in relation to responsibility for roads was over at long last . The Federal-aid Road Act of 1916 , as it came to be called , provided for federal contributions to the states for the building of roads of $5 million in 1917 , $10 million in 1918 , $15 million in 1919 , $20 million in 1920 , and $25 million in 1921 . It stipulated that federal funds would have to be matched by the states , dollar for dollar , and it provided that the federal government would have general supervision and a measure of control over the laying out of roads , as well as their design and construction . The Act made the states responsible for permanent maintenance of highways , some of which had been sorely neglected . This Act , moreover , contained the important provision that federal funds could go only to states with regularly constituted highway departments , designated as proper agencies for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states had such highway bodies . The Office of Road Inquiry of 1893 , which had been known as the Office of Public Roads after 1905 , now became the Office of Public Roads and Rural Engineering , and was designated as the agency to supervise expenditure of these funds . In 1918 , that agency was renamed the Bureau of Public Roads , and Thomas H. MacDonald , who had performed so outstandingly well in Iowa 's road-improvement programs , was named Commissioner . A supplemental act , in 1921 , established the Federal-aid System , consisting of seven percent of the total rural mileage in the states . The late Roy Dikeman Chapin , founder and president of Hudson Motor Car Company , working closely with MacDonald , played no small part in preparing the way for passage of the Act of 1916 . When the joint Congressional Committee was considering the pros and cons which had to be evaluated in 1915 before it could make the necessary recommendations for passage of the Act , Chapin had enlisted the support of virtually all motor vehicle manufacturers , the motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as favoring the Act . Then , in the spring of 1916 , he prevailed upon the producers of motor vehicles , tires and petroleum products not to oppose taxation on their products as long as funds thus collected should be applied to construction and maintenance of good roads . Chapin stated his case so persuasively and with such good grace there was no opposition . The ardent work he and his good friend and business associate Carl Graham Fisher did on behalf of the Lincoln Highway Association resulted in Chapin being unanimously chosen chairman of the automotive industry 's trade association 's highway committee . As such , he went to Washington to inform legislators , wrestling with the problems of financing federal roads , of the favorable attitude of  | his colleagues , who were also his competitors . As one reporter of the time put it , " The rare spectacle of a group of manufacturers favoring taxation of their product was , to say the least , astonishing . " There is little doubt that Chapin must be accorded major credit for the favorable climate in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion of good roads when , in 1901 at age 21 , he spent 10 days at the tiller of a little Olds , struggling over the so-called " roads " of Ontario and New York state on a trip from Detroit to Manhattan . He had been one of Carl Graham Fisher 's friends since the time when , as sales manager of Olds Motor Works , he had joined Fisher in investing in a process for waterproofing automobile tops . It was the affable Chapin , with his perpetually boyish grin , who got the manufacturers of motor vehicles , tires and accessories to pay out the millions of dollars through the Lincoln Highway Association to get stretches of that road built . It was in September , 1917 , six months after the United States entered World War I , when Chapin had his first opportunity to propound in Washington an idea which had been taking shape in his mind for many weeks . For the Council of National Defense , Daniel Willard , president of the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad , had assumed responsibility for transport of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential civilian transport services . Chapin convinced Willard that motor trucks , intended for use in France , could relieve the railroads of some of the wartime burden by being driven to points of embarkation . He was so sure it could be done that he said he thought they could also carry loads of war materiel from factories to dockside . Willard told him to go ahead ; set up a committee and try it . Manufacturers of motor trucks knew little then about the uses of their products in actual service . Most trucks were owned in units of not more than half a dozen , and were used as adjuncts of such businesses as department stores , breweries , coal yards , and large printing companies . Overland hauls , except by the military , were virtually unknown . Moreover , tire manufacturers had not yet learned how to make pneumatic tires capable of carrying heavy loads ; so , trucks generally ran on solid rubber tires . In his search for capable truck authorities , Chapin was led to George H. Pride , who ran a haulage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 107 trucks . Newton D. Baker , Secretary of War , appointed both Chapin and Pride to the Highways Transport Committee on 9 November 1917.  | Chapin 's first task was that of persuading motor vehicle manufacturers and officials of the federal government that tricks destined for war service should go on their own wheels from factories to shipping ports . This meant that thousands of vehicles would have to move overland from inland points in Michigan , Ohio , Indiana , Illinois and Wisconsin , over primitive roads to docks in Boston , New York , Philadelphia , Baltimore and Newport News . Chapin persuaded officials of the American Automobile Association to make the necessary pilot trips and produce the maps needed for the trips from factories to ports . Even the speeds were indicated , for they were based on grades and kinds of surfaces . On steep downhill runs , drivers were instructed to save their brakes by keeping the engines in gear , a practice which , though now commonplace , was then considered a radical departure from custom . The plan worked amazingly well . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built in 1916 ; 128,000 in 1917 ; 227 , - 000 in 1918 . Because of these demands , too , the War Service Committee , headed by Harvey S. Firestone , had brought about needed standardization which reduced the multiplicity of solid-tire sizes to 15 , with further reductions recommended . Firestone also assumed leadership of his industry 's efforts to produce good pneumatic tires for the heavy-duty requirements of trucks on poor roads , so that , by summer of 1918 , such tires were introduced . Chapin had by then come to realize that , to improve and maintain the three million miles of highway that he foresaw as the nation 's need , the expenditure would have to run into billions of dollars , and that federal , state and local authorities would have to be made aware of what he was learning . In the federal government , as in the states , he found that highways were of so little concern that people in highway departments were considered of minor importance . At every opportunity , he strove to correct that attitude among his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governors of the states that he visited . He was an early advocate of larger salaries for highway officials ; he declared it would not only attract more capable people , but would remove them from the temptation of graft . He campaigned for more adequate appropriations for all highway departments , and emphasized the need to locate highways so that they would best serve the entire economy , and according to the soundest principles of engineering and financing . At war 's end , about 600,000 trucks were in use . The War Department had a large surplus . Clearly , the dumping of these trucks  | on the market would have ruined many of the firms that produced them . The infant truck manufacturing industry would have been strangled in its crib . To prevent such dumping , large numbers of trucks were sold to European governments at a quarter of their original cost ; the Post Office Department adapted 5,700 of them for use as mail carriers . Then , someone had the happy idea that the rest of them might conceivably be taken over by the Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1916 , had authority to grant matching funds to states undertaking highway construction under supervision of authorized state highway departments . For one reason or another , not all states were taking advantage of this opportunity . It was , therefore , believed that there would be better response if state highway departments were offered motor vehicles which might be converted to use in construction or building of good roads . By October , 1921 , the Bureau thus received 24,353 vehicles and a large supply of spare parts , valued at $85 million . These surplus vehicles played major roles in launching the postwar construction with which our national network of highways may be said to have begun . That road program had been hampered because it had started in 1916 , in the lengthening shadow of war . Extensive construction did not , therefore , get under way until 1920 . Irving Bernstein , in a report prepared for the United States Department of Labor in 1924 , said that most of the vehicles given to the states were adapted to road-making uses by addition of special equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoisting devices . Among many ingenious transformations that were reported were conversions of ambulances into portable offices and tool-cribs for highway construction crews . Other vehicles were transformed into scrapers , sprinklers and snowplows . The Bureau was in entire accord with the transfer policy . In his 1921 report , Chief MacDonald wrote : " The beneficial effects of the distribution . . . can scarcely be estimated . " Many states , he added , were able to continue highway construction in that difficult time only because they received this equipment . In the majority of states , he said , the equipment made it possible to maintain roads that would otherwise have been allowed to deteriorate due to lack of equipment and funds . As late as 1928 , about 15,000 of the surplus American trucks were still in use in France . They helped rebuild France ; their counterparts in the United States helped pull the American people out of the mud .  | After the war , Chapin addressed himself to another job which he felt needed attention if the motor vehicle was ever to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in summertime and put them in storage for the winter , they were going to remain " pleasure cars " indeed , more or less luxuries , and there was not much reason for getting too excited about paving roads . And , unless something could be done to change that attitude , the lawmakers would be inclined to tax motor vehicles as if they were fur coats , jewelry , flacons of perfume or other luxuries . There was , indeed , already a wartime tax being collected on passenger cars ; and , with the well-known habit which all temporary excises have of acquiring granitic permanence , it was not likely that this imposition would be removed as long as cars were fair-weather conveyances . Although most passenger cars were fair-weather models ? touring cars or roadsters ? they usually had waterproofed cloth tops that folded down and were euphemistically referred to as " one-man tops " because it was theoretically possible for one agile and ambidextrous person to unfold one and snap and strap it into place as a roof in case of rain . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " convertible " which , however , had not the remotest relation to what the word means nowadays . It then meant a touring car or roadster for which you bought , for about $500 extra , a fairly solid-roofed structure known as a " California top . " In the summer you stored the top ( usually overhead on hooks and by hoisting with the block-andtackle in the hayloft ) in the stable or garage . In autumn you used it as a replacement for the folding fabric top . That enabled you to use your car in bad weather . It was comfortable , but barely . With his dream of an all-weather automobile , Chapin went to the subsequently famous body-building Fisher brothers : Frederick , William , Charles , Edward , Lawrence , Alfred and Howard . What Chapin wanted to know was : Could the Fishers help him design and build a closed body which would not cost much more than an open one ? The Fishers ' solution had effects on the use of motor vehicles , on the fate of highway development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound and as far-reaching as were those set in motion by the curved-dash Oldsmobile and the Ford Model T. The automobile became year-round transportation . The National Automobile Show in 1919 displayed 60 makes of passenger cars and 144 commercial vehicles . Only one out of 10 automobiles were closed cars . Exactly 10 years later at the 19th  | annual show the situation was reversed ; nine out of 10 were closed cars . During the same period a Federal-aid Highway System was created by law , and a workable federal state partnership in highway development , first provided in 1916 , was perfected in the Federal-aid Highway Act of 1921 , a landmark in American road history . The states designated their federal-aid systems , limited by the 1921 Act to seven per cent of total road mileage , and built up competent highway engineering organizations . The good roads movement which had been sparked by the organized cyclists , the railroads , the Glidden tours and the Lincoln Highway Association , burst into an irresistible national movement . Obviously there was more going on in that turbulent decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Era of Wonderful Nonsense " following World War I. According to popularized accounts all the women were dancing the Charleston during those years , and all the men , wearing raccoon coats , reclined in Stutz Bearcats swigging bathtub gin out of hip-flasks . One thing that was going on , destined to have revolutionary impact on mankind the world over , was the emergence as a fact of life of the automotive age . The American people had become excited about motor vehicles and were moving rapidly to get themselves out of the mud so they could use them . Who were the heroes of that remarkable decade ? A good many , their identities submerged in the activities of groups , must forever remain anonymous . No detailed records were kept , for example , of the numerous conferences held between federal and state representatives to hammer out the basic agreements underlying the 1921 Federal-aid Highway Act , yet in 1944 Chief MacDonald declared his " firm belief that the principles which characterized that Act would not have been obtained had it not been for the sober judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then composed the American Association of State Highway Officials . " MacDonald himself , whose entire career was marked by deliberate and careful anonymity , unquestionably was a major factor , not only in determining the direction of the federal-aid program but in setting extraordinarily high standards , over a 34-year period , for its administration . The late Samuel C. Hadden , of Indiana , who headed AASHO in 1944 , spoke for all highway officials when he paid tribute that year to MacDonald 's " unselfish devotion , his broad vision , his kindly firmness , his manifest honesty and integrity , which have been a tremendous influence in every chapter of the record . " Senator Carl F. Hayden , of Arizona , whose active interest in highway affairs  | began when he was elected to Congress in 1912 , said of MacDonald : " Fortunate indeed is the nation that can produce such a man and have his superb service available to it for so long a time . " MacDonald 's dedication to the federal-state partnership concept in highway building , and his ability to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his part that government , industry , agriculture and other organized citizen groups also were working partners . In the private sector , in 1919 , Chapin , took leadership in establishing the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce as the automobile manufacturers ' trade association . The ' late Walter Pyke Johnson , a former Denver newspaperman who had served as executive secretary of the wartime Highways Transport Committee , was asked to serve as Washington representative and Secretary of the Highway Committee for the new body . The late Norman Damon was assigned as his assistant . Both were to become authorities in matters pertaining to highways and highway safety , Johnson serving as president and Damon as vice president of the Automotive Safety Foundation . In March , 1919 , the new organization 's first bulletin , drafted by Chapin , Johnson and Damon , pointed out that two weeks earlier , Congress had appropriated $200 million for highways and that President Wilson had signed the bill just before he had sailed for Europe to attend the Peace Conference . This , added to the $73 million still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly staggering total the amount that was being set aside for highways . Considering the fact that it had taken years of educational work to get Congress up to the passage of the first federal-aid Jaw , it is clear that a great change had come about . Chapin stated : " The time has come when we must have a more comprehensive plan . The government should help direct the states as to the type of highways they should build . Lack of proper guidance has so far been one of the greatest faults in construction of American highways . " In some quarters of the federal government , recognition of the value of this legislative about-face was immediate . The Department of Labor wrote a letter urging the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce to do all it could to get a program of highway building started as soon as possible , to reduce unemployment as men were released from military service . The bill which established the Federal-aid Highway System in 1921 was introduced by Senator Charles E. Townsend of Michigan .  | Its signing was one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States for that interval of a few days between those two visits of his to Paris . It was appropriate that this historic piece of legislation should have been initiated by a Senator from Michigan , for this state had by then taken a lead not only in motor vehicle production but in highway construction and traffic regulation . In 1893 the Michigan legislature had empowered counties to appoint road commissions and adopt county-wide administration of roads , but the counties were so slow to take advantage of the law that , by 1914 , only 59 counties had county road systems . The cyclists had brought the first pressures to bear on the lawmakers of Michigan . The leader of the good-roads campaign in the state was Horatio S. Earle , who earlier had been national president of the League of American Wheelmen . Earle was also a member of the state senate . When he sponsored a resolution providing for a committee to investigate and report on how to improve highways , Governor Aaron T. Bliss appointed such a committee and named Earle as chairman . The committee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Port Huron , to the new post of state highway engineer , but the job was without salary because no money had been appropriated . The obstacle for Earle and his committee was an article in the state constitution of 1850 which prohibited the state from engaging in any work of internal improvement . It was interpreted as meaning that the state could not build roads . Earle had then campaigned so effectively against this constitutional barrier that , in 1905 , the people voted to amend the document and the state legislature immediately passed a law establishing a state highway department and providing for state funds to counties that met state-established engineering standards of construction . Governor Fred W. Warner , who succeeded Governor Bliss that year , appointed Earle highway commissioner and named Rogers his deputy . In 1905 , Michigan also began to apply proceeds from motor vehicle license fees to construction of roads . Construction and maintenance , however , were still carried on by the counties with state aid . It was in this way , and largely due to Earle 's enthusiastic support , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile of concrete road , on Woodward Avenue between Six Mile Road and Seven Mile Road , just north of the Detroit city limits . That piece of pavement , the first of its kind in the world , was studied by public officials and highway engineers from all over the nation , as well as other lands . " The building of concrete highways spread from Wayne County throughout the world , "  | wrote Dr. F. Clever Bald in Michigan in Four Centuries . In 1917 , Michigan created a state highway department to control construction and maintenance of a state-wide system of roads to meet the requirements of the Federal-aid Act of 1916 . Then , in 1919 , the people voted for an amendment to permit the state to borrow $50 million for a comprehensive program of highway construction and maintenance . " The good roads of Michigan had their origin in this program , " said Dr. Bald . It was natural for Detroit to assume a position of leadership in the search for traffic safety when it became " the Motor City , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Traffic Division of the Detroit Police Force was organized in 1909 , with a sergeant and twelve patrolmen . The officers worked out a system of hand signals to control traffic , but it took several years for people to accept such signals as anything other than friendly greetings . The innovation , oddly enough , was adopted largely because there were , that year , so many traffic fatalities on streets still dominated by horse-drawn traffic ; for , in contrast to 1.16 deaths per 100 million motor vehicle miles on Detroit 's freeways nowadays , there were , in 1909 on Detroit streets 30 fatalities for every 100 million horse-travel miles . In 1911 , Edward Hines , chairman of the Wayne County Road Commission , established a precedent when he ordered stripes painted down the centers of highways . Such painting had been tried by Hines first as means of warning motorists not to try passing on old bridges that were too narrow for two cars . Since the width established for two-way concrete pavement was then 16 feet , there was little room between passing cars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1915 , Sergeant Harry Jackson , of the Detroit Police Department 's Traffic Division , designed the first stop sign . He had intended it for the intersection of Cass Avenue and Clifford Street , but the Detroit Common Council refused to pay for such nonsense and the Automobile Club of Michigan paid for it . Sergeant Jackson wanted to put up such signs on 24 main streets and , when his first one proved effective , the Council had become enthusiastic enough to allocate funds to make six major streets through thoroughfares . It was in that year , too , that an attempt was made to make two of Detroit 's main thoroughfares into one-way streets , the worth of which had been proved by tests in the city in 1911 ; but , once more , the Common Council backed away from the idea , this time because irate merchants had howled about hurt to their business . Detroit pioneered that year , too , with clearly painted pedestrian crossings . The world 's first illuminated traffic signal was also tried out in  | Detroit in 1915 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Michigan Central Railroad and put it on a standard at John R. Street and Adams Avenue . It was operated by Louis Berg , Sr. , then a traffic officer but later superintendent of police . Berg had the messy oil lantern electrified with storage batteries in 1916 . In 1918 , the first three-color light to control street and highway traffic was installed in Detroit , and that historic relic is now on permanent display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn , Michigan . Detroit in 1919 was a city rapidly adapting itself to the motor vehicle . In that year , Sergeant Jackson was named the first Director of Traffic . The Traffic Division had expanded by then until it contained not only the many officers needed to direct traffic at street intersections but also a Motor Division of officers on motorcycles , devoting full time to traffic control . It had , also , a Public Safety Bureau , under whose guidance the Automobile Club of Michigan organized the world 's first school patrols of boys and girls for control of traffic in the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , the Accident Investigation Bureau was organized ; it later became the Accident Prevention Bureau . The principal reason for all the pioneering in traffic regulation in Detroit was that James Couzens , one of the founders of Ford Motor Company and for years the company 's treasurer , had agreed to become Police Commissioner of Detroit in 1916 . The forthright and fearless Couzens created such a furor with an order banning all parking in the busiest downtown streets that he dramatized the need for traffic control and establishment of a modem traffic code . The end of World War I brought the beginnings of change , in the automotive industry and in road building . Experimental production of balloon tires had been successful ; safety glass had been perfected ; and metallurgists had learned how to produce the kind of sheet steel needed for the bodies of closed automobiles . In 1919 , death claimed both of the Dodge brothers , John and Horace , who had acquired immense fortunes as original investors in the Ford Motor Company , and who had become important automobile manufacturers in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which bore his name , met with misfortune and his company faded from the scene . William Crapo Durant , who had founded General Motors , had lost and recaptured control of it before the war , again lost control in 1920 , when the du Ponts of Delaware brought in Alfred Pritchard Sloan , Jr. , to manage it . Ford had bought out  | his stockholders in 1919 rather than accept the court ruling " that a business corporation is carried on primarily for the profit of the stockholders , " which he considered repugnant . In the drastic shakeup of management that coincided with the financial crisis , Ford lost William S. Knudsen to General Motors , and , for his new employers , that great Danish master of massproduction converted the Chevrolet into a serious competitor of Ford 's Model T. The car had been designated for discard by a firm of management engineers that the du Ponts had hired to appraise the properties of General Motors . Then , in mid-1921 , at the end of that critical post-war depression year , Chapin launched his Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , known as the Essex coach . The popularity of the Essex coach showed the automobile manufacturers that a year 's production might be scheduled so that the work would occupy the working force for almost an entire year . The success of Chapin 's gamble thus helped to stabilize the industry . On the other side of the Atlantic , in 1923 , a glimpse of things to come in road building was projected at an historic meeting : the International Road Congress at Seville , Spain . At this Congress , the recommendations offered have remained so topical that , as Hermann Schreiber said , " one can safely say the Seville Congress marked the beginning of modern road-building throughout the world . " Had those recommendations been put into practice , Schreiber added , many later congresses would not have been necessary at all . " At Seville , " he said , " the road builders and traffic experts ( among others ) called for crossing-free roads , or crossings with a clear view ahead of at least a hundred yards ; for roads that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of road-signals and trafficsigns ; and for bends with a minimum view ahead of a hundred yards . " Most important , however , was the demand that roads should be built specially to carry heavy motor vehicles ? that a new technique should be evolved for both surface and foundations , which should make allowance for rapid acceleration and the steadily increasing weight of vehicles . Special recommendations were also made concerning gradients and curves . In general , it was made abundantly clear that this new mode of transport ? the automobile ? had developed to a point where all existing roads , which had hitherto been regarded as adequate , were quite unsuitable . A vast web of grey and black highways began to spread across the face of the earth , and a new era in the history of world traffic had dawned . " In the United States , while federal and state governments were beginning to subsidize scientific research into the problems of high@@1525.txt  | of the nineteenth century . ' Characteristically , both periods were crises of confidence , if we may so express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both were marked by a revulsion from democratic principles and a revival of authoritarian and aristocratic ideas . The first of these movements , vaguely and vulgarly known as romanticism , was part and parcel of the aftermath to the French Revolution . As M. Gouhier has shown in the second volume of his great work , La Jeunesse d'Auguste Comte ( 1933-1941 ) , nominalistic , mechanistic notions held the field up to 1789 and beyond , ' while from 1815 onward there is a decisive swing towards realism and organicism . It is fascinating to see in detail , how , especially in France , the star of Newton begins to set , and at the same time the star of Lamarck to rise : how la physique sociale gives way to la physiologie sociale . Henri de Saint-Simon , Comte 's master , becomes a different man in the course of time : Little by little , ' we are told by Bougie and Halevy in the introduction to their edition of La Doctrine de Saint-Simon ( 1924 , p. 18 ) , his old instinct for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to the conclusion that a regime of absolute liberty fritters away all efforts , wastes all energies and multiplies antagonisms ; absolute liberty is a negative idea ... " After 1820 , ' M. Mauduit adds , Saint-Simon . . . lays ever greater stress on the principles of order and authority . . . At the end of his career , Saint-Simon finally went so far as completely to repudiate liberty , which appeared to him as no more than disorganisation . ' With this political reorientation , an intellectual reorientation went hand in hand , a fact of the greatest possible importance in our context . To quote M. Mauduit once more : At first , Saint-Simon admired especially the mathematical and physical sciences . . . and hoped to find in universal gravitation a means of systematising the world ; later on . . . he treated mathematicians and physicists with contempt and ended by calling them brutiers because all they studied was inorganic bodies ' ( p. 147 ) . Comte underwent exactly the same  | evolution . Up to 1820 /22 he was an orthodox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stood for , including the atomistic social theory associated and assorted with it : reorganiser becomes his watchword . A short passage in a letter to his friend Valat , dated Dec. 25 , 1824 , reveals as in a flash of lightning the whole tendency of his thought , together with its basic inspiration : Egoism will in the end lead to general dissolution ' ( cit . Mauduit , p. 30 ) . The only question which arises in this context is why the reaction to the philosophy of egoism ' should have been so long delayed : between 1789 and 1820 or 1825 , 30 or 35 years had passed , a whole generation had come and gone . The answer ( at which we can do no more than hint here ) lies in the fact that the new libertarian and individualistic society gets finally discredited only with the outbreak of the economic crisis which stretches from 1815 to roughly 1825 and becomes particularly sharp and distressing after 1818 . There is evidence that the misery of the unemployed weighed heavily with Auguste Comte , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom in him which leads not only to the demand for governmental measures of relief , but beyond it to a general condemnation of laissez faire and even to the assertion that the body social , when healthy , is as integrated as the body physical , and that a relaxation of the fibres here and there can be nothing but disease . In the ' seventies , the situation was similar , as economic history can well show . After 1825 , the voices of criticism become muted , though they refuse to be silenced altogether . Capitalism takes another stride , especially in connection with the railway boom . Freedom seems to work after all : there is bread-and-butter for a widening circle of men . At once sociological atomism is back in favour . The great economists Menger and Walras , in 1871 and 1874 respectively , preach anew the twin gospel of individualism and mechanicism . But round about the latter date , the boom breaks . From then on to the year 1896 , there stretches the unhappy period commonly known as the Great Depression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least of competition , and with a renewed call for conscious intervention whose practical effects were increasing protectionism , cartellisation , Trade Unionism , the small family pattern and other .  | elements and efforts at ordering and planification ' . The detail does not belong to this place ; suffice it to say that the broad intellectual tendency towards organicism observable in these years , a tendency noticeable above all in Emile Durkheim , is rooted in such strivings , fears and hopes , in the diagnosed sickness and recommended remedy of the age . Durkheim is not only the theoretician who asserts that social facts are so real that they can be treated comme des chores ; he is also the student of that dread phenomenon of contemporary life , l'anomie . Our analysis of the origin of organismic forms of thought in societies which are not organical in their mode of coherence gains powerful support from the fact that organicism , in one shape or another , has always been the ideology of conservative parties . Karl Mannheim has proved this in detail , but proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact which is universally known and universally acknowledged , it is this . The four greatest names in the history of conservatism in Europe are , as everyone agrees , Joseph de Maistre and Louis de Bonald in France , and Adam Muller and Friedrich von Gentz in Germany . All four grew up in that uneasy period which lies between the revolutions of 1 789 and 1848 ; and if there is any difference between them and their contemporary Auguste Comte , it does not lie in the basic idea of their sociology . It rather lies in a double secondary feature : Comte was both more and less of an organicist than they were : less , because he thought that society as it happened to be , still needed transforming before it could achieve la synthese finale , the final , lasting state of thorough integration , and more because that final state was conceived by him even more on the model of a hale and hallowed body natural than it was by them . But the proposition that society is and ought to be organical in coherence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute form , the question of validity . If Comte , and to a lesser degree Durkheim , shared some of the values of men like de Maistre and de Bonald , Adam Muller and Gentz , was their thinking not as hopelessly contaminated as theirs ? crudely speaking , should they not be excluded from the history of sociology and relegated to the history of  | politics ? It would be quite wrong to deny that both Comte and Durkheim , not to speak of all the others , were to some extent deflected from the straight and narrow path of scientific and scholarly objectivity by the practical preoccupations which filled their minds , and it makes no difference whatsoever to their case that they were not aware of the ideological element in their thought which welled up from the depth of their subconscious . But it would be equally wrong to jumble them together with the hackwriters of conservative interests . A scholarly attitude remains a scholarly attitude , even if it bears in itself a tendency which ought not to be there . This healthy attitude will in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided only that the will to truth is strong enough , as it undoubtedly was in the case of Durkheim . If the development of the Durkheim school is scrutinized , we find two complementary trends at work . The first is a retreat from radical organicism . As a young man , Durkheim talked very much like Herbert Spencer , using biological and physiological jargon with as little judgment as he did . But later on the tone changes ? not as much , perhaps , as it should have changed , but yet to a considerable degree . The mature Durkheim is not an organicist , but a member of the cultural school , though always very much on the right wing of that school . The second trend is even more significant in our context . It can be summed up by saying that from a sociologist , as the word is currently used , Durkheim turned into a social anthropologist . There is a long way from the study of suicide in contemporary France ( 1897 ) to the study of religion among the stone age people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Les Rig/es de la Me'thode Sociologique ( 1895 ) is far more applicable to Arunta society than to Parisian life ; and it is also far more applicable to Parisian life after its re-interpretation in an idealistic spirit ' than in its earlier , rather crudely materialistic version . The fact is that the older Durkheim , and even more his disciples such as Marcel Mauss , felt more at home in primitive society than they did in modern . We know why : in the study of primitive society they could feel solid ground under their feet , and this is the reason ( a good scholarly reason ) why they shifted to this field .  | To sum up , then , theories like those of Comte and the younger Durkheim need to be treated with due care , perhaps even with suspicion , but they need not be condemned outright . A certain value-pursuit , conscious or unconscious , will regularly push a man in a definite direction , but the question is always , how far he is prepared to go : will he keep within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the controls of reality or disregard and defy them ? Only in the latter case will truth be irretrievably lost . Even a practical-political aim will thus not necessarily be mortal to scholarship . Indeed , one can go so far as to say that its presence in or underneath a theoretical statement may be a sign of realism , in so far as the tendency in thought is also a tendency of life . Granted that some of Comte 's and the younger Durkheim 's thinking was wish-determined and not fact-determined , their wishes were forerunners of facts of the future : not valid at the time , their ideas were destined for validation , for self-validation . It is partly because of Comte 's and Durkheim 's teaching ( among other factors ) that society has recently retreated from individualism and advanced towards firmer integration , and in the measure in which this advance continues , will the philosophical realism ? the realistic sociology ? of these men gain increasing truthvalue . So much about organismic modes of thought which arise , where , strictly speaking , they ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrated , but merely on the way to organic integration . But there is yet a third case to be considered , besides that of organicism in accordance with , and organicism in anticipation of , the facts ? the case of organicism against the facts . Herbert Spencer was born in 1820 and formed his decisive ideas around i 845 , in the middle of a period of advancing individualism , not like Comte ( born in 1798 and maturing around 1823 ) and Durkheim ( born in 1858 and maturing round 1883 ) in a period of reaction to and revulsion from it . What can have induced this man to preach organicism , and what are the consequences of his incentive , whatever it may have been , on the value of his doctrines ? One thing is certain : it was neither contemporary life , characterised by rampant individualism and unbridled competition , nor yet a personal ideal that led Spencer to the kind of sociology which he retailed , for in politics he was so radical a liberal that he can almost be called an anarchist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | a strong influence as it conquered both theoretical observation and practical programme . The answer is not far-to seek . Spencer wanted above all to be a scientist , and more particularly a scientist of the kind which was most in fashion and favour at the moment ? a biologist . His day , let us not forget it , was the day of Darwin , the heyday of Darwinism . Spencer was out for prestige . And as he was in search of prestige rather than in search of the truth , he produced a system , the bulk of which is the reflection of an artificial model and not a reflection of actuality , of the facts as they were . If we may express ourselves in a somewhat stilted , but nevertheless technically correct way , we can say that both Comte 's and Spencer 's thought were ideologically distorted , but whereas Comte 's was a macrosociological ideology , based on a valuestriving of all society in his day , Spencer 's was a microsociological one , the result ( the none too respectable result ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside a restricted circle , that of the intellectuals , and of a personal bid inside that circle , a bid for recognition . And for this reason , the value of his ' inductions ' can not be rated very high . Will it be said that this is too harsh an estimate of Herbert Spencer ? ( ? or rather of the Herbert Spencer who wrote The Principles of Sociology , for his Principles of Psychology reveal a far different mind and make him a forerunner of the cultural school ) ) He himself has proved the weakness of his main doctrine in the most conclusive manner by virtually abandoning it , though far too late in the day . ' When he says , in The Man versus the State ( 1884 ) , that society is no more than the mutual limitation of activities ' , he speaks not only in his own authentic voice , the voice of the champion of individuality against social coercion , but also in the authentic voice of his time which had realised a higher degree of individualism than any earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the mutual limitation of activities , implies a decisive rejection of realistic sociology : it is difficult to think of a neater formulation of the opposite principle , the principle of nominalism . Real are in this view only the individuals who limit each other : society is not a real ? a substantial ? entity . In the Man versus the State , Spencer has made his way to a sound appreciation of the contemporary facts ; and in doing so , he has led us away  | Aristotle and St. Thomas . Rousseau , like Aristotle , gives a clear , if somewhat diffuse presentation of the fundamental ideas . Kant , agreeing with him in the essentials , brings , like St. Thomas , the core conceptions of the theory into sharpest focus . A good deal of Rousseau 's doctrine is presented to us in the form of conjectural history ; he himself speaks of a histoire hypothetigue des gouvernements ; l but we must not be put off by this curious mode of presentation . He is not really interested in what has been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is merely a screen on to which he projects the image of his ideal and of a hoped-for future . It is , in Rousseau 's case , no paradox to say that he means tomorrow when he speaks of yesterday . Now , the fundamental assertion which Rousseau puts forward under the cover of fictitious history and political fable can best be expressed by an inversion of Aristotle 's famous adage that man is a noon politikon , a social being . To Rousseau he is essentially a solitary creature . The state of nature ' , which is supposed to open the history of mankind , is defined as a state under which men lived in isolation ' ( I , p. 359 ) . Primal man was not caught , as we are , in the net of society . His neighbours were not to him what they are to us . . . He had no more commerce with them than with the other animals ... ' ( ib. , p. 272 ) . This is how Rousseau describes savage man ' : . . . wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without settled domicile , without war and without entanglements , without any need of his neighbours as well as without any desire to hurt them , perhaps without ever knowing any one individually . . . subject to few passions and sufficient unto himself ... ' ( ib. , p. 263 ) . Just how deep this individualism goes , can be seen from the treatment accorded to the family . Rousseau allows that it is a natural society ( and the only one that is so ) , but he immediately takes back the better part of what he has conceded . Even the family is natural ' only for a fleeting moment , namely while the children need their parents in order to survive . As soon as this need comes to an end , the natural bond dissolves . . . If they continue to remain united , it is no longer on the basis of nature , but on that of will ; and the family itself is maintained purely by  | convention ' ( II , p. i xi ) . If they continue to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is concerned , an exceptional rather than a real case . In that primitive state , having neither houses nor huts nor property of any kind , each slept where accident led him and often only for one night ; males and females came together by chance , according to fortuitous encounter , occasion and desire , without language being very necessary for the expression of the things which they had to communicate to each other : and they turned from each other with the same ease . The mother suckled the children to begin with out of her own physical need ... As soon as they had the strength to seek their own food , they did not hesitate to leave their mother : and as practically the only means of finding each other again was not to lose sight of each other in the first place , they soon came to the point where they would not even recognise each other ' ( I , pp. 242 /43 ) . The whole idea of man revealed in these and similar passages stands in the sharpest possible contrast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for society ; according to Rousseau , they are meant for solitude . Sometimes the point is put in a manner that can almost be described as brutal : Men are not made to be crowded together in anthills , but to be scattered over the earth ' , we read in Emile . The more they congregate , the more they corrupt each other . The infirmities of the body as well as the vices of the soul are the infallible effects of such too numerous association . Of all animals , man is the one least able to live in herds . Human beings crowded together like sheep would perish in a very short time . The breath of man is mortal to his neighbours ; this is no less true in the literal than in the metaphorical sense ' ( VI , p. 6o ) . While this is not only unrestrained , but also unphilosophical language , we find in Emile also a passage which brings Rousseau 's nominalism into sharp focus and formulation : Natural man is all for himself ; he is the numerical unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself and his equals . Social man is merely a fractional unit which depends on a denominator , and whose value lies in his relation to the whole , which is the body social . The good social institutions ' ? Rousseau clearly uses the word good ' here in inverted commas ? ' are those which know how best to denaturalise man , how to rob him of his absolute existence in order to give him a relative one , and how to transfer .  | his ego into the common unity ; so that each individual no longer thinks of himself as one but rather as part of that unity ' ( VI , p. 14 ) . A natural ' society can therefore be expressed by the formula la + lb + lo + ... In ; it is a sum of irreducible units , and not an irreducible unit ; it is a collection , not a corpus mysticum ; it is one only in language , but not in reality . In view of this historical account and philosophical attitude , it must be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ought not to exist ; but it does , and because it does , there is an explicandum for him , a problem which realistic ' , i.e. holistic-organismic , thought has no need to raise or to face . With becoming frankness , he admits that he is puzzled . It can be seen . .. from the small care which nature has taken to draw men together by mutual needs and to facilitate the use of language , how little she has done to prepare their social habit , and how little of her own she has put into their efforts to establish its bonds . Indeed , it is impossible to imagine why , in this primitive condition , a man should have been more in need of another man than an ape or a wolf of his like , nor , assuming the need of the assistance of one 's neighbours , what motive could have induced others to comply , nor even , in the latter case , how they could have agreed about the conditions of mutual aid ' ( I , p. 250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man is born free , and everywhere he is in chains . . . How has this change come about ? I do not know ' ( II , p. i i o ) . Needless to say , Rousseau is not satisfied with this negative answer . He casts about for some explanation and tries several , the least unrealistic being along Malthusian lines . ' The whole is no more than a pseudo-problem which Rousseau has brought on himself by his excessive individualism and his radically nominalistic sociology . What concerns us here is not the fantastic discussion of a historical evolution which never took place , but the spirit in which it is conceived , and this spirit is not only the spirit of individualism and nominalism , but also that of mechanism . Man abandoned solitude and fled into society ( or rather , to use Tonnes ' term , which is most appropriate here , into association ) because a balance was disturbed , the balance between his individual strength and the difficulties with which life confronts him and with which he has to contend ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on balance , the loss account does not come up to the level of possible and actual gain , even though our view of the balance-sheet is somewhat distorted ' by subsequent developments due to human stupidity and wickedness . First about the disequilibrium which initiated and necessitated the great change : I suppose men come to the point where the hostile forces which , in the state of nature , run counter to their preservation , gain the upper hand . . . over the forces which any individual is able to employ in order to maintain himself in that state . In that situation , the primitive condition can not go on ; and the human race would perish if it did not change its mode of life . Now , as men can not create new forces , but only assemble and direct those already in existence , they have no other means of self-preservation than the formation , by association , of a sum of forces which might overcome the hostile influences they are up against . . . This sum of forces can spring only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pp. 123 /24 ) . It is the desire for self-preservation , then , individual self-preservation , that levers man out of solitude and propels him into society . Society is not a primary fact of the human situation , it is a secondary phenomenon that needs to be historically explained and ? we are almost inclined to say : economically ? justified . From a study of the pros and cons of the social state ? the compensations ' ( II , p. i 3 z ) which man receives when he surrenders his freedom ? it appears that the enterprise is , on the whole , profitable : Look for the motives which have led men , united by their mutual needs in the great society of all mankind , to unite more closely still by means of civil society i.e. in particular states , and you will find no other than that of making the possessions , life and liberty , of each member secure through the protection of all . . . All , born equal and free , surrender their freedom only for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II , p . III ) . The advantage or utilite of the last quotation is , of course , personal advantage and personal utility . Society is no more than a tool in the hand of the individual , and not the individual a cell in the body of society . For the rest , irreducible diversity , nay , irreconcilable conflict remains supremely characteristic of the social state : In the social state , one man 's good is of necessity another man 's evil . This connection lies in the nature of things and nothing could change it ' ( VI , p. 164 ) . All this is nothing , if not consistent nominalism . Rousseau  | drives it forward as far as he can . But the very consistency with which he develops this position leads in the end to its collapse . The model of man and society which he has built up in his mind appears to him in the end unsatisfactory and unrealistic , and , without abandoning it , he feels constrained to modify it ? to modify it by the introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-interests . For a final assessment of the value and validity of nominalism as a social philosophy , this is a fact of supreme importance , comparable to the abandonment , at the eleventh hour , of realism by Herbert Spencer . The third or mediating sociology can draw great comfort from either event . The social cement which , by the side of self-interest , Rousseau sees as part of the binding which holds societies together is the natural sentiment of pity , a natural repugnance to seeing any sensitive creature , and above all our fellow-men , perish or suffer ' ( I , p. 213 ) . If our common needs unite us by the bonds of interest , ' we read in Emile , our common sufferings unite us by the bonds of affection ' ( VII , p. 26 ) . This is an important statement . It marks a step in the direction of instinctualism as represented in this book by Wilfred Trotter . In so far as pity is natural to , and inborn in , human beings , and in so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , society is not an artefact , but a natural growth ; not only a convention , but also a reality ; not a fiction , but a fact . However , it is only a very short step in the direction of instinctualism that Rousseau takes . Once again , he retracts the better part of what he has conceded . First of all , fellow-feeling is to him a weaker sentiment than selfhood . In case of conflict , the former must yield ( cf. I , p. 214 ) . Secondly , pity is only a partial experience , not one that would extend to all human beings : It does not lie in the human heart to put oneself in the place of people who are happier than we are , but only of those who are more to be pitied ' ( VII , p. 30 ) . And ? thirdly ? even the sympathy for those whom life has treated more harshly than it has ourselves is not unmixed with , perhaps we can even say , unspoiled by , a good dose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one does not believe oneself exempt ' ( VII , p. 32 ) . This statement echoes Calvinist conceptions , not to say Hobbesian ones . Rousseau 's habitual insistence that man is born good must not be taken quite au pied de la let/re . Even harsher is the following  | passage : Pity is sweet because we feel , in putting ourselves into the place of him who suffers , the pleasure of not , suffering as he does . Envy is bitter because the contemplation of a happy man , far from putting the envious person in his position , arouses in him a regret of not occupying it already . It appears that the former exempts us from the pains which he suffers and that the latter robs us of the good which he enjoys ' ( VII , p. z6 ) . Finally , the reference to pity only increases the negative value-accent that lies , for Rousseau , on all social life : It is man 's weakness which renders him sociable ; it is our common miseries which lead our hearts towards humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insufficiency ... A truly happy being is a solitary being . . . We attach ourselves to our neighbours through the experience of their pains rather than through that of their pleasures ' ( VII , pp. 25 , z6 ) . On reading these words , one can not but be reminded of Hobbes ' notorious chapter XIII in the Leviathan : Men have no pleasure , but on the contrary a great deale of griefe in keeping company ' . And though Rousseau does not accept the warre of every man against every man ' as the natural condition of mankind , he is yet very far from seeing society kept together by any kind of innate goodness or social instinct : It is from the conjunction and combination which our mind is able to make of these two principles self-preservation and pity that . . . all the rules of natural law flow ; there is no need to bring in the principle of sociability ' ( I , p. 213 ) . Isi spite of a natural tendency to commiserate , on some occasions , to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social bond must ? in view of all this ? be explained , not along holistic , but along atomistic lines : convention is its origin , not nature . It is posterior to individual existence , not prior to it . In his educational novel Emile , there is a little story which gives us the gist of Rousseau 's sociological theory in its simplest form . Emile , brought up in more or less the same way in which nature brings up her happiest children , the so-called savages , is of course a closed self , a self-centred and self-contained monad : He thinks of himself without considering others and finds it good that others should not consider him . He expects nothing of anybody and feels no obligation to anybody . He is alone within human society . . . ' ( VI , p. 411 ) . However , this last sentence is metaphorical , not a statement of fact . Emile is emphatically not alone  | within human society . He cuts across the paths of others , and others cross his path . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Little Emile , living out his play instinct , plants some beans and eagerly watches them grow . One day , arriving at the bed he has made , he finds them all gone and the earth turned over . Robert , the gardener , appears guilty of this apparent act of vandalism . But , when charged , he defends himself by attacking . Emile himself had committed an act of the kind he now complains of : when he had planted his beans , he had ruined the Malta melons which the gardener had started just there , at the very same spot . Here then we have a conflict situation such as Rousseau regards as archetypal for all human encounter , for all social life . Two rights , two equally good rights , face each other . How can their clash be resolved ? How can a comparatively peaceful social life be secured ? In one way only : by an amicable arrangement for the future , by a contrat social . Would it not be possible ' , the tutor ( none other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a settlement to Robert ? Let him grant us a corner of his garden , so that we can cultivate it , under the condition that he shall have half of the produce . ' This solution is accepted on both sides ; peace is restored , or rather established ; but underneath the contract there remains the tension of contradictory interests . Remember ' , says Robert , that I shall dig over your beans , if you touch my melons ' ( VI , pp. 150 et seq . ) . Here , in a nutshell , we have Rousseau 's whole social philosophy . The social order is a sacred right ' , a sacred institution , which serves as basis to all others ' , says the most classical statement of the doctrine , Du Contrat Social . Yet this right does not come from nature ; hence it is founded on conventions ' ( II , p. i i o ) . Julie d'Etang , Rousseau 's ideal woman , asserts the same principle : All human society . . . is based exclusively on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jean-Jacques and Emile , the ideal pair of friends , live according to it : We were never dependent on each other , but we always came to an agreement ' ( VI , p. 296 ) . This is the best that men can do for each other . Even friendship . . . is an exchange , a contract like the others , ' Rousseau assures us , though he admits that it is particularly sacred ( VII , p. 54 ) . An interesting context in which Rousseau 's individualism , atomism , contractualism , and sociological nominalism in general comes to the front is his discussion of the role of punishment in  | education . As is well known , he has gone down to posterity as the most determined condemner of the rod . Use the rod and spoil the child ' was his opinion , as against that of the Bible . Pestalozzi , the mildest of all educators , was his disciple . Yet Rousseau 's advice to grown-ups was to hit back , if the child hits them first , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 147 ) . This recommendation is based on Jean-Jacques ' deepest conviction , namely that all social life is a pattern of mutuality : the child has to learn this fact , or else it will be unfit for any social role whatever . The secret of human coexistence and co-operation lies in the adage of the Roman lawyers : do ut des , the adage which can be translated into homely English as tit for tat . Now , this recognition leads us immediately deeper into Rousseau 's thought : it leads us from his contractualism to his mechanicism . Clearly , a contract is only fair , and can only be fair , if the contracting parties are equal in strength ? in other words , if there is a balance of forces at the basis of it . The good society is , properly speaking , an equilibrium system , within which individual counteracts and counterchecks individual , so that nobody can subdue his neighbour . If there is no such balance or equilibrium , all is lost : In the relations between men , the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mercy of another ' ( I , p. 296 ) . Primitive society was an equilibrium system ; present-day society is not . Yet all society ought to be . Hence Rousseau 's programme for the future . Hence also the battle-cry of the French Revolution : liberte , egalite , fraternite . Translated into sociological language , this famous device can be interpreted as follows : if men are granted freedom , harmony will come about , provided only that there is equality at the same time . For if there is equality , men can not harm each other , and liberty , far from leading to disorder , will lead to order ? indeed , to the firmest kind of order that we can imagine , order on the basis of the laws of mechanics , physics and astronomy . Both Rousseau and his disciples were mechanicists , and both were normative mechanicists , regarding egalitarian , i.e. equilibrated society as a desideratum rather than a factum , an aim to be attained , not a value already enjoyed . The famous Dedication to the Discours sur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equality which nature has established among men ' with the inequality which they themselves have instituted ' ( I , p. 191 ) . Here lies the diagnosis of all social ills , and  | here the recipe for a general and abiding cure . Retournons a la nature ! ' It is in this particular that the society of the past is so decisively superior to that of the present , and because of it we may proclaim it as the model of the future . Inequality is hardly noticeable in the state of nature . . . Its influence is almost zero . ' The study of primitive communities demonstrates that men . . . are by nature as equal among each other . . . as the animals of all species ' ( I , pp. 267 and 209 ) . The consequences of this real natural equilibrium of social or rather individual forces were as beneficial as the results of its abandonment and replacement by a fictitious unnatural law-book equality are disastrous : In the state of nature , there exists a de facto equality which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible that the simple difference between man and man should be great enough to make the one dependent upon the other . In the civil state , there exists a de jure equality which is chimerical and vain because the means provided for its maintenance ' ? the civil laws which defend the rich against the poor and the constitutional laws which defend the privileged against the people ? ' are themselves the causes of its destruction , and because the strength of the public hand , added to that of the strongest individual ... undoes the kind of equilibrium which nature had established between them . From this basic contradiction flow all the others which can be seen in the social order between appearance and reality . The greater number will invariably be sacrificed to the smaller , public interest to private ... ' ( VII , pp. 6o , 61 ) . How could it be otherwise ? When the underlying equilibrium is lost , the social contract turns into its own caricature . Let us sum up in four words ' , Rousseau writes with a caustic pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rich and the poor : you have need of me because I am rich and you are poor ; let us therefore come to an agreement : I will grant you the honour of serving me , on condition that you give me the little that you have left , for the trouble which I shall take of ordering you about ' ( I , p. 346 ) . As can be seen , the story Rousseau has to tell is a story of the fall : mankind forfeited its pristine happiness when it lost the onetime equilibrium of man and man . But where there is fall , there is also the possibility and the promise of redemption . The social contract must be re-drawn so that it strengthens rather than upsets  | the balance . Rousseau calls it a remark which should serve as a basis to the whole social system : that instead of destroying natural equality , the fundamental contract substitutes , on the contrary , a moral and legal equality for whatever physical inequality nature may have put between men , and that men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or intelligence , become all equal through convention and law . Under bad government , this equality is no more than apparent and illusory ; it serves only to keep the poor man in his misery and the rich in his usurpation . In fact , the laws of our perverted societies are always useful to those who possess and detrimental to those who have nothing : from which it follows that the social state is only of advantage to men , if all of them own something , and none of them has too much ' ( II , p. 136 ) . There can hardly be a clearer formulation of Rousseau 's programme than these words : clear not only in respect of its practical aim , but also in respect of its philosophical foundations . A good society is a society in equilibrium : equilibrium is only possible if each of the associates has as much power of assertion ( and power in defence ) as every other . This conviction appears again and again in Rousseau 's works . In one context he calls mediocrite . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 443 ) . In another he writes as follows : With regard to equality , it is not necessary to mean by this word that the shares of power and wealth should be absolutely equal , but . . . that no citizen should be so rich as to be able to buy another , and none so poor as to be forced to sell himself . . . . Would you give coherence to the state ? Bring the extreme positions as near to each other as possible : suffer neither nabobs nor beggars . These two status groups , naturally inseparable , are equally disastrous for the common good ' ( II , p. 175 ) . And again : The greatest evil has already come to pass when there are poor who need to be defended and rich who need to be contained . It is only on the middle classes that the whole force of the laws become effective ; they are equally powerless against the wealth of the rich and the misery of the poor ; the former eludes them , the latter escapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slips through it . It is therefore one of the most important duties of government to prevent the extreme inequality of possessions ' ( I , p. 412 ) . No doubt , as a theoretical speculator , Rousseau operates with  | what we now call a model , a mechanistic model , not unlike a pair of scales which get into equilibrium only if the weights on either side are equal . But he does not entirely forget the hard and fast facts of reality . He has ( though he does not tell us so openly ) a negative and a positive illustration of his theory : France and Geneva . Clearly , the following sentences refer to France , the country par excellence of social disequilibrium , where a rich nobility confronts a wretched peasantry : Men distributed unequally over the territory and packed together in one place while others are depopulated ; the agreeable arts and industry in the narrower sense of the word favoured at the expense of the useful and hardworking crafts ; agriculture sacrificed to commerce ; the tax-collector made necessary by the bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venality driven to excess . . . so that even the virtues are on sale for money : such are the most obvious causes of wealth and misery , of the substitution of private for public interest , of mutual hate among the citizens . . . . ' ( I , pp. 412 /13 ) . Against this dreadful ancien regime , Rousseau holds the ideal , born of his mechanistic sociology or normative mechanicism , of a nouveau regime under which France would become a commonwealth of cottages . The reader can find the seminal ideas in chapter IX of book I of Du Contrat Social . What Rousseau demands is , in substance , a restriction of landed property to the size which corresponds , on the one hand to a man 's needs of subsistence , on the other to his capacity of work . ' If this principle were accepted , the large estates of the nobles would disappear ; their place would be taken by the equal holdings of free farmers ; society would get into a stable equilibrium underlaid by a balance of individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal Rousseau found to some extent realised in the city of his birth . Geneva had no great landowners and no povertystricken serfs : her citizens , practically all artisans , were much of a muchness . Julie 's clever friend , confidante and cousin Claire grasps the point clearly on a visit to the city . Her language lets the mechanistic philosophy behind it shine through : Seeing the mutual action and reaction of all the parts of the state which keeps it in equilibrium ' , she writes , one can not doubt that more art and true talent is used in the government of this small republic than  | in that of the greatest empires ' ( V , p. 225 ) . But Rousseau speaks not only through the mouth of a fictitious character ; he raises his own voice in witness . Remembering the far-off days when he had been an apprentice under the shadow of the Bourg de Four , he writes in his Confessions : Nothing would have suited my mood better , and nothing would have been better fitted to make me happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craftsman .. . such as that of the engraver 's is at Geneva . This state is lucrative enough to yield an easy subsistence , and not lucrative enough to lead to opulence ' ( XV , p. 66 ) . Knowing Rousseau as we do , we must be permitted to doubt that a modest middle class existence of this kind would ever have satisfied him . Did he not run away from home because he found it unbearable ? But what is unacceptable as a piece of self-estimate and self-revelation , is highly significant as an indication of a social dream . Once again we find that the social state is only of advantage to men if all of them own something , and none of them has too much ' ; that everything depends on avoiding those extremes of fortune which unbalance even the most robust inter-human relationships ; in a word , on that equality which means equilibrium , and which , through its internal tensions , keeps the mechanism of society in order as the mainspring does the works in a Geneva watch . This whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonism between men will lead to their peaceful co-existence , if only equality will help them to keep each other in check , can well be summed up as a doctrine of the unsociable sociableness ' of the human race . But this striking phrase is not Rousseau 's ; it comes from the pen of his ardent admirer , Immanuel Kant.l Kant shares Rousseau 's basic sociological convictions , as St. Thomas Aquinas did those of Aristotle . But he improved on their formulation , and that in a double way . Firstly , he made it perfectly clear that their common opinion was a kind of mechanicism ; and , secondly , he recognised , and made others recognise , that their mechanistic sociology was normative rather than positive , a picture of the good society rather than a picture of given society , a reflection of the great Ought rather than a mirroring of the sober Is.  | Rousseau , as we have seen , often speaks in mechanistic terms , but they are to him hardly more than useful metaphors , a kind of poetry in prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications of words , knows full well that they betoken a very real kinship between the science of society as developed by Rousseau , and the science of mechanics as developed by Newton . Discussing , ostensibly , international peace , but , sub rose ' , intranational peace as well , Kant expresses the conviction that one day we may perhaps secure it through the principle of equality as between mutual action and reaction ' , in other words , through the establishment of a balance of power . Order will then be produced and perpetuated after the manner of an automaton ' . Here , as everywhere , Kant regards it as our prime task , both as men of theory and as men of action , to comprehend the secret mechanism of the arrangements of nature ' , to find a law of equilibrium . ' We have seen that Rousseau , in the style of his age , had chosen to put forward his nominalistic sociology and to preach his social ideal in the guise of hypothetical history . There is little harm in this foible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to unwrap it from its fictitious coverings . Yet Kant felt , and no doubt rightly , that there is a certain danger in this mode of exposition after all . It may create the impression that the social contract is , in some sense of the word , a fact , as if concrete men had , once upon a time , met at a concrete place and arranged to put themselves under a common law . And even if this primitive conception is avoided , if the contra/ social is conceived , in accordance with the lawyers ' concept of quasi-contract , as an accord entered into , not consciously , but semi-consciously , not by express words , but by conclusive deed , there remains an element of the fictitious which is the better avoided in philosophical discussions . Kant therefore tried to get rid of it by pronouncing the concept of contrat social a regulative ' principle . By this he means a principle which can serve as a test and touchstone of social institutions and enactments , rather than as their historical explanation . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good or bad ? Ask yourself if it would have been acceptable to all the citizens to whom it is meant to apply , in other words , if it could have become part and parcel of a social contract , if such  | contract-making , such social ordering , were technically feasible . If yes , it must be unexceptionable ; if not , it clearly sins against the most basic condition of a successful social life , the equal freedom of all under the law . We see from this re-interpretation of Rousseau 's conceptions that Kant not only brings out their mechanistic character , but also the fact that they constitute a normative , rather than a positive , mechanicism.l This , incidentally , is a point where we can see how true it is that extremes tend to touch . If a constitution is to be permanent ' , Aristotle had written over two thousand years before Rousseau and Kant , all the parts of the state must wish that it should exist and the same arrangements be maintained ' .2 This coincidence of view between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normative mechanicism is not really surprising . For however much they may have differed in their interpretation of actual social life , they agreed , as we all must , in their social ideal , the vision of a truly pacified and harmonious order of human coexistence .  | GREAT AS the differences are which divide normative and positive organicism , the contrast between normative and positive mechanicism is even greater . The reason for this lies ultimately in the dissimilar character of the natural phenomena with which the organical and the mechanical sciences are respectively concerned . An organically coherent system is not , in all its parts , univocally determined . Heart and liver , if they are to function together , must certainly be proportioned to each other , but there is some latitude ? some possibility and permission of variation ? on either side . Within rather elastic limits , deviations from the norm do not destroy the health and harmony of the whole . Indeed , it is doubtful to what extent we can speak of a norm here . Between proportion and disproportion , normality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermediate stages which make it impossible to divide Is and Ought too sharply from each other . It is different with mechanically coherent systems . There is no half-way house between balance and unbalance : equilibrium either exists , or it does not . And equilibrium is also , and always , describable in absolutely unambiguous , absolutely univocal mathematical formulae . Exactitude is therefore the key-note of mechanistic thought in the sense of thought that consciously imitates the mechanistic model . Playing upon words , we may say with good reason that positive mechanicism is apt to be more positivistic than positive organicism . We can see how true this is on almost every page of Vilfredo  | Pareto 's monumental work , the Trattato di Sociologia Generale , l which lies before us as the most massive and impressive statement of the mechanistic conception of social life . Pareto is a fighter : what he fights for is radical factualness , what he fights against , wishful thinking in any and every sense of the word . Grimly determined to track down and expose the consequences of this most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the so-called social sciences from this point of view , he finds practically no theoretician who would deserve to be described as a scientist : all , all of them , were preachers , do-gooders , men of the pulpit rather than servants of the truth . What he writes about Aristotle is characteristic : Had Aristotle held to the course he in part of his nature studies so admirably followed , we would have had a scientific sociology in his early day . Why did he not do so ? There may have been many reasons ; but chief among them , probably , was that eagerness for premature practical applications which is ever obstructing the progress of science , along with a mania for preaching to people as to what they ought to do ? an exceedingly bootless occupation ? instead of finding out what they actually do . His History of Animals avoids those causes of error , and that perhaps is why it is far superior to the Politics from the scientific point of view ' ( ? 277 ) . But Aristotle was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mania are usually far worse . Pareto does not mince his words . He calls Rousseau 's social contract a conception of utter inanity ' , and finds only one term sharp enough to characterise the Kantian categorical imperative ? the term childish ' ! 01503 and ? 1521 ) . Against the pseudo-scientific theories which have disgraced the past , Pareto pits his own ideal of a pure science which will serve the truth and only the truth . He demands that sociology should at long last become logico-experimental ' . It should , first of all , become experimental , that is , experiential , factual , narrowly restricted to what is observable . It should , in other words , become as sharply divided from metaphysics as physics has been since Kepler and Galileo . And when the facts are elicited , described and docketed , they should be correlated and connected up by  | purely logical methods , that is to say , by procedures which leave as little room for error as the deductions and conclusions of the logicians and the mathematicians whose chains of reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when these two basic conditions are fulfilled will sociology cease to be what even Kant 's social speculations still were ? ' arbitrary assertions relating to altogether fantastic things ' , a sort of metaphysical poetry ' ( ? 15 21 ) . This ideal of a social science cleansed of prejudice must not only be everybody 's theoretical creed , but also everybody 's practical pursuit . On this point there can not be a moment 's hesitation nor yet a shade of disagreement . But if the desired end is to be attained , the word prejudice must surely be taken in its widest possible connotation . Now , prejudice has many forms , and Pareto did not see them all . That is why he stumbled and fell . A science of society can be spoiled in at least two ways : by letting a practicalpolitical , and by letting a philosophical , preoccupation turn you from the truth ; by preaching a certain social , and by preaching a certain scientific ideal , is an understatement to say that Pareto was aware of it . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost maniacal fervour . But , alas ! , as sharp-sighted as he was in one eye , so blind was he in the other . What he really pursued was not a social science in agreement with social facts , but a social science in agreement with physical , and more especially mechanical , laws . He never stopped to think whether the ideal of a mechanistic sociology is not a contradiction in terms , whether the differences between man and molecule are not so great that it is impossible to compare them , let alone force them into the same conceptual frame . Men are for him the molecules of the social system ' ( 2080 ) , power-points which push and pull until a certain equilibrium is reached . Far from seeing reality as it is , he saw it as it would have to be , if it was to fit into a preconceived intellectual pattern , if it was to yield a mechanistic model and interpretation . He may have fancied that he saw the facts , but in fact he saw only fancies . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead him as far away from the truth as the prejudice of the others in favour of a social or human ideal . If others propounded wish-determined instead of fact-determined theorems , he also had his desire which determined him . My wish is ' , he says before he even looks at the facts , to construct a system  | of sociology on the model of celestial mechanics , physics and chemistry ' ( ? zo ) . And again : All the natural sciences to a greater or lesser extent are approximating the logico-experimental type . We intend to study sociology in just that fashion , trying , that is , to reduce it to the same type ' ( ? 68 ) . Pareto 's trouble was that he was trying too hard ? trying by hook or by crook , as the saying goes ? to reduce sociology to a kind of celestial mechanics , physics or chemistry ' . It has been said of Spencer that his mind was like a magnet , picking out the iron which suited it , but leaving the other metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was worse . For not only did he reject some evidence , but he falsified a large part of it so as to make it possible to manipulate it , to transmogrify society into a kind of mechanism . He who despised all metaphysics was an extreme metaphysician himself , basing himself , as he did , on the unproven and unprovable proposition that all reality is controlled by the same laws , and that these laws are the laws of rational mechanics . In view of this conviction , it meant little or nothing if he at times admitted that social facts are more complicated than physical and even economic ones ( ? 2079 ) , for this is only another way of saying that they are essentially the same . The heartpiece of Pareto 's Trattato is in paragraphs 2060-2104 , which deal with the elements that serve to constitute society ' and the state of equilibrium ' . All that goes before leads up to them ; all that follows is meant to make them secure . Basically , Pareto tells us , a social system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he seems to approach the organismic position : Something of the sort of interdependence is observable in animal organisms . The form of the organs determines the kind of life that the animal leads , but that manner of living in its turn has its influence upon the organs ' ( ? zo6I ) . A little reflection will prove that this is not really organicism . For organicism , in the sense of holism , thinks , not in terms of parts , however interdependent , but in terms of totality ; not in terms of organs , but of organisms . Apart from that , the very next lines show clearly that Pareto models his sociology , not on biology and physiology , but on mechanics and mathematics . In order thoroughly to grasp the form of a society in its every detail , ' he writes , it would be necessary first to know what all the very numerous elements are , and then to know how they function ? and that in quantitative terms.l  | It would , that is , be necessary to assign indices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they , being quantitatively considered , would be stated in the form of mathematical equations . The number of equations would have to be equal to the number of unknowns and would determine them exhaustively ' ( ? zo6z ) . Pareto , who is nothing if not honest , immediately admits that we have no hope of finding the figures which we need ; indeed , that we are very hard put to it if we want even to identify the elements involved ; yet he insists all the same that , in principle , his approach is justified . But does his formulation really refer to a social system ? Surely not . It is an abstract statement of the general conditions that determine any equilibrium . As such , it is no doubt correct . But how are we to get from this abstractum ( as empty in itself as any mathematical formula ) to the concretum of social life ? any given social life ? if we have no hope of determining the numerical indices which alone can put flesh on the dry bones ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty ? Is it not likely , is it not at least possible , that our inability to give a quantitative description of the social system in terminis is due to the fact that it is not quantitative , not quantitatively determined ? However that may be , it becomes increasingly clear , as we read on , that Pareto does not talk about society at all , that he talks all the time of equilibrium in general . Take the following sentences : The real state ... of the system is determined by its conditions . Let us imagine that some modification in its form is induced artificially . At once a reaction will take place , tending to restore the changing form to its original state as modified by normal change ' ( ? zo67 ) . Clearly , a mechanical system will react in this way . If I have before me a pair of scales in balance and I touch one of the sides , the disturbance so created will after some swinging up and down give way again to the determined stable state . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new equilibrium position will tend to come about and we shall have successive determined equilibrium positions of the scales . But do societies behave analogously ? Have they , too , an inherent tendency to equilibration ? Pareto does not prove it . He simply assumes that they do , that they must . Are the human forces that meet in a social system really quantitative after the fashion of physical energies ? Pareto does not prove it . He simply assumes that they are . Here , where he reveals his central conceptions , Pareto speaks with the  | voice , not of the sociologist , but of the mechanician . In his early years , he had been an engineer , a bridge builder . He remained , in substance , the same sort of man when , later in life , he changed over to the social sciences . But , of course , he tries to be a sociologist as well as a mechanician , and that must mean that he has to find human analogues , real or imagined , to the determinants of mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For personal , as opposed to impersonal forces , appear to have at least two characteristics which would seem to put comparison altogether out of the question : it looks as if they were underlaid by freedom ; and it looks , too , as if they were different from age to age , qualitatively different , and not merely different according to number , weight and measure . Pareto , with his sharp eye , saw that here lay his problem , that he had to argue these differences away if his mechanistic sociology was to be more than a sort of metaphysical poetry ' . He had , in other words , to show that things are not what they seem , that underneath apparent freedom there lurks real determination , and underneath apparent history an abiding pattern , a congeries of forces that do not change . This task is tackled in the two thousand or so paragraphs which precede the analysis of the state of equilibrium ' . They occupy three vast volumes in the English edition , volumes brim-full of profound learning and profounder thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at special pleading . Pareto tries to achieve his purpose by making certain incisive and decisive distinctions . The first is that between logical and nonlogical actions . Logical actions are rational actions . They have an aim which can be realised in the world as we know it ; this aim is clearly envisaged ; and the means chosen to secure fulfilment are appropriate . Non-logical actions , on the other hand , are irrational actions . They may have an aim which can not be realised within the framework of space and time ; or , if they have an aim which it is possible to realise , it may not be clearly envisaged ; or , finally , the means chosen to secure fulfilment may be inappropriate . The mariners of ancient Greece knew two means of navigation : rowing with oars and making sacrifices to Poseidon . In so far as they rowed with oars , they acted logically ; in so far as they made sacrifices to Poseidon , they acted non-logically . Subjectively , they may have seen their two methods as equivalent . Objectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive .  | Logical action is characteristic of technology , science , and , to some extent , of economic life . In other fields , action is predominantly , not to say exclusively , non-logical . Anything that we do out of an inherited drive or in accordance with traditional custom is non-logical , and as these two incentives ( instinct and habit ) are the main determinants of our conduct , by far the greater part of our behaviour is irrationally caused and permeated by irrationality ? by sentiment , as Pareto very often puts it , using a word which clearly contrasts with rationality , reason and logic . It was , above all , this conception of the springs of human action which put Pareto into contrast to the earlier protagonists of mechanicism , such as Immanuel Kant . For Kant , man was a rational animal : irrationality was no more than an impurity , a thing of the past , and not necessarily a fact of the future . ( For this reason he could think in normative terms . ) For Pareto , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest fringe of rationality to his nature . And irrationality was for him an abiding trait of man that would dominate all ages to come as it had dominated all ages before . ( For this reason , any normative conception was out of the question for him ; everything was as it had to be ? the basic thought of positivism . ) Pareto was inclined to believe that nothing connected him with a man such as Kant , but he was wrong . Both were rationalists , though rationalists with a difference . Kant was the hopeful rationalist of the rosy dawn of the capitalist ( technological and economic ) age ; Pareto was the disappointed rationalist of the glaring noon . Both hankered after a world dominated by reason . The philosopher of the eighteenth century thought it was coming ; the scientist of the twentieth knew that it was not . It was because Kant and Pareto were , in the depths , agreed , that both were led to a mechanistic conception of social life . This comparison of the two great mechanicists may be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . What matters more in our argument at this juncture is the use to which Pareto puts his distinction of logical and non-logical conduct . Logical conduct may be something of a rarity , but in so far as it exists , it shows an area of human reality where all is determination and all is permanence . Taking pots and pans by the shortest route from the potter 's shed to the market square is a typical piece of logical conduct . There can be no two ways of doing it , since only  | one line can be the shortest between two points ; and there can be no historical variation either , because the shortest line is always the shortest line . Hence , where logical action is concerned , we can have excactly the same type of theoretical analysis as in mechanics and mathematics . A sociology dealing with it will be capable of making statements as objectively and eternally true as the proposition that twice two is four ? and this is the reason why Pareto defines it and describes it with so much care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . For here all seems to be caprice , and everything different from age to age . The Romans adored Jupiter ; we adore Science . The Romans gambled on auguries ; we gamble on football pools . When we cross the dividing line between rational and irrational conduct , we seem to lose the solid ground under our feet . Can there be a science of what is indeterminate and ephemeral ? Assuredly not , if by science we mean mechanics and mathematics . But , then , things are , in principle , if we are to believe Pareto , not really unpredictable and time-bound even here ? they only look as if they were . Pareto claims that even this area of human reality will , properly analysed , yield us facts ? determinate , determined , and timeless facts ? which can be made the raw material of a proper science , and he proceeds again by his quasi-scholastic method , i.e. by making a radical distinction . This second distinction , more daring than the first into logical and non-logical conduct , and more basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between residues ' and derivations ' . A residue is what ordinary people would call a drive ; a derivation is what , by an almost equally popular term , is often described as an ideology . If we take any socially relevant action , Pareto claims , we can split it into two parts , the action itself , the deed done , and the explanation of it which is its frequent accompaniment . The action itself , the deed done , is for Pareto , a typical materialist and hence a metaphysician malgre soi , something physical , and that in a double sense of the word . It is physical in that it comes out of our physis and manifests its drive-structure , its inherent tendencies ; and it is physical in that it is observable in the physical world and works a change in it , in that it is kinetic , a force acting in a field of forces , no different really from the pushes and pulls studied by celestial and terrestial mechanics . This action , this system of actions , is what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what  | mainly matters ; it is the stuff , as it were , of social reality . Compared with it , the verbal aura with which we like to surround our actions is unimportant . It is secondary , it is mainly , nay , merely , embellishment . We are animals with a fringe of reason to our nature . As animals , we conduct ourselves in accordance with our physical propensities ( the residues ) ; as animals with a fringe of reason to our nature , we like to add a kind of explanation or justification ( a derivation ) to our actions . In our pride , we like to think that our mind controls our conduct ; but this , Pareto maintains , is not so . We act first , and invent a reason ' for our action afterwards . The word reason as here used must be put into inverted commas . For non-logical action , being by definition irrational , being based on sentiment , has no real reasons ; it has only pseudo-reasons , and these we call derivations ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws this whole distinction . He draws it in order to be able to develop a mechanistic theory of social life . If mind is only marginal in men , if men 's behaviour is a manifestation of the mechanical forces inherent in them , if the intellect and the conscious will intervene only post festum , then we can have a mechanics of human interaction as we can have a mechanics of the high heavens where the sidereal bodies interact and strive for an equilibrium . By his ( superficially ) clever disjunction of residues and derivations , Pareto has thrown both freedom and history out of doors . Men can talk as they like , but not act as they like ; men talk differently in different periods , but their mode of action is always in essence the same . And even if it changes , it changes simply because the subconscious , one could almost say sub-human , drive-structure changes ( for instance through race-mixture and such-like physical events ) . It does not change because men would assert their freedom and steer history into new channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not direct history , but are directed by nature . All these conceptions are manifestly unproven and unprovable metaphysical assertions , and they are none the more convincing for being labelled scientific . Pareto can not even expose his distinction between residues and derivations ? the residues which remain when the verbal veil of outward actions is ripped off , and the derivations which , drawn from them , are wrapped round them ? without betraying his ulterior motive  --  to get rid of freedom and history . Listen , for  | instance , to the following quotations . Theorizing , writing books , is regularly part and parcel of non-logical conduct . Now , theories in the concrete may be divided into at least two elements , one of which is much more stable than the other . We say , accordingly , that in concrete theories . . . there are . . . two principal elements ( or parts ) ; a substantial element ( part ) , which we shall designate as a , and a contingent element ( part ) , on the whole fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The element a corresponds , we may guess , to certain instincts of man , or more exactly , men .. . and it is probably because of its correspondence to instincts that it is virtually constant in social phenomena . The element b represents the work of the mind in accounting for a . That is why b is much more variable , as reflecting the play of the imagination ' ( ? 798 and ? 8 ) 0 ) . A remains unchanged throughout history and therefore can yield statements as absolutely true as 2 X 2 =4 ; b does not remain unchanged and would make a mechanistic-mathematical doctrine of man and society impossible , if it were important . But it is not important . Derivations . . . figure only as manifestations , as indications , of other forces that are the forces which really determine the social equilibrium . ' They are merely the signposts which show where a certain push is aiming , not the energy which exerts the push . Nothing could be more misleading , we are assured , than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning directly as determinants of the social equilibrium ' ( ? 1403 ) . Hence a is reality ; a alone is reality ; b is not . Pareto 's argument has reached port . Pareto , needless to mention , presents these considerations in as scientific a form as he can , but actually his argument reminds one of rather loose popular talk which is often heard . Human nature is always the same ' , people will say , human nature is the same the wide world over ' , etc . In statements of this kind , there is a basic ambiguity . Human nature can either mean the physical nature of man , his body and all that goes with it , and then the assertions concerned are very largely right ; or it can mean the customary and habitual mode of human action , different from age to age and from country to country , and then they are very largely wrong . In Pareto there is no ambiguity , but that only makes his theory less realistic than even this popular talk . He simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based on custom and habit . He sees only half of the facts , the half that  | suits him . The rest is defined out of existence . Sic volo , sic jubeo . Pareto distinguishes six residues : the instinct for combinations , the tendency to combine and build up things , to create empires , for instance ( class I ) ; group persistences , the tendency to keep aggregates , once formed , in existence ( class II ) ; the need of expressing sentiments by external acts ( class III ) ; residues connected with sociality , e.g. the tendency towards enforcing social uniformity ( class IV ) ; integrity of the individual and his appurtenances , i.e. the individual 's self-defence in the widest sense ( class V ) ; and sex ( class VI ) . His volume II , where all this is discussed , is most impressive in size , and even his detractors have to admire his learning . But does he really distinguish six residues or quasi-instincts ? Surely not . If sex is set aside , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III belong together : they represent the forces making for activity , for change . In the same way , classes II , IV and V belong together : they represent the forces making for stability , for resistance to change . Even this part of Pareto 's analysis is really and basically an imitation of mechanics : classes I and III comprise the centrifugal , classes II , IV and V the centripetal tendencies in the social system . Sometimes the aping of mechanics becomes quite obvious . Thus Pareto writes at the beginning of the section dealing with group persistences : After the group has been constituted , an instinct very often comes into play that tends with varying energy to prevent the things so combined from being disjoined , and which , if disintegration can not be avoided , strives to dissemble it by preserving the outer physiognomy of the aggregate . This instinct may be compared roughly to mechanical inertia : it tends to resist the movement imparted by other instincts ' 0992 ) . It is true that the social universe , like the physical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this is very little out of which to make a system of sociology . Still , this is not the worst . The worst is that residue ' is , critically considered , no more than a label affixed to an action after it has been done . Does a man see a house on fire and run away from it ? Residue number V ; does he act in the opposite way and enter the house to save somebody or something ? Residue number IV . Even in the latter case , there is no free decision to help , to fight down fear , to overcome animal instinct ? oh no , for this would destroy Pareto 's precious theory . Everything is due to different  | inborn quasi-instincts . Indeed if the house is the man 's own house , both his flight and his bravery appear in Pareto 's system as effects of the same quasi-instinct , residue number V ; if the man runs away , he wants to preserve himself ; if he does not , he wants to preserve his things ( appurtenances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two different , even opposite , manifestations . And this happens often . Does a man read naughty books ? Residue number VI . Does he call for suppression of pornographic literature ? Again residue number VI , says Pareto ( cf. ? 13 3 I ) . He might just as well tell us that there is no difference between +a and ? a ! Clearly , anything and everything can be done with such conceptions . The so-called residues are in reality no more than words , and this is why they can be so easily manipulated . They belong to the same class of fictitious entity as the many instincts ' which psychologists at one time ( now happily long past ) invented ? including a supposed instinct for cleanliness which even the man in the street knows to be conspicuously absent in little boys . But Pareto is happy to have his residues , for now he can define his social equilibrium ' . The sentiments or instincts that correspond to residues , along with those corresponding to appetites , interests , etc. , are the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaking in general terms , suppose a society is being influenced by certain sentiments corresponding to the residue groups A , B , C . . . manifested through the derivations a , b , c . . . Now let us give each of those groups of residues a quantitative index corresponding to the intensity of its action as a group . So we get the indices a , j3 , y . . . Let us further designate as S , T , U . . . the derivations , myths , theories , and so forth , that correspond to the residue groups , A , B , C . . . The social system will then be in equilibrium under the action of the forces a , /3 , y .. . which are exerted approximately in the direction indicated by the derivations S , T , U . . . due account being taken of counterforces ' ( ? 875 and ? 2087 ) . Let anyone ask himself , how much these sentences tell him about social reality . If he is at all honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always aggressive and supercilious , says of many other writers that their theories are pure verbiage ' , but his own empty cleverness deserves this epithet and label as much as their disquisitions do ? or more . This is a case where one must say with the old proverb that he who lives in a glass-house should not throw stones .  | However , let us be charitable and formulate our criticism in a more restrained way . What Pareto has done is , surely , this : he has taken reality and drained out of it human freedom and historical variability and thus gained a model which is amenable to treatment in mechanistic terms . The trouble is that this model bears no longer any recognisable likeness to social life as we all know it . In social life , as we know it , man is indeed activated by certain inborn drives , for instance , sex , as Pareto says , but these drives come up against culturally created , not naturally existing , norms which make up a system of social control and mould human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecular ) motion . Sociology is less concerned with the instinct of sex than with the institution of marriage ; and the institution of marriage regulates sex , disciplines it , controls it , and is thus part and parcel of the system of social control . This system of social control , secured by pressures and internalised by education , is something man ( as creator of culture ) has added on to , and superimposed on , man ( as part of nature ) , and as it is the product of personal , and not of impersonal or physical forces , it is characterised by great plasticity . Different ages have carried on different experiments in living together , and we are free to try yet others today or tomorrow or at any time we like : and because this is so , neither freedom nor history can be disregarded by the student of man and society . They are not only real , but essential to human reality . What should we say of a physiologist who could talk of man as if he were a dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely what Pareto does . He talks of man as if he were a molecule , and of society as if it were a parallelogram of dead forces and not a communion of living personalities . The price he has paid for his mechanistic model ? his mechanical toy ? is too great . But the free variability of social life , observable in history , is not only a fact which can be held , from the outside as it were , against Pareto 's mechanicism : it is a fact which asserts itself even inside it , so to speak . Great cataclysms like the French Revolution are simply there and can not be disregarded . Pareto has to accommodate them within his scheme . But this is next to impossible , for he has denied the main causes of revolutionary change . Widening his concept of the social equilibrium , discussing what he calls the general form of society ' , Pareto finds that the following  | factors make a society what it is : its physical environment ; its economics ; its derivations ; and its residues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset : the physical environment is practically constant ; the economic element is no less so : it is dominated and determined by the desire to maximise satisfactions , to achieve the greatest possible output from the smallest possible input , and this is an absolutely unchangeable endeavour on the part of economic man . Indeed , Pareto 's economics is entirely what the Historical School called perpetualist ' and universalist ' . Economists have often discussed Pareto 's law ' developed in his Cours d'Economie Politique ( 1896 /7 ) . This so-called law ' ( it is , of course , nothing of the kind ) 1 suggests that income distribution is by and large the same in all societies . Not only have everywhere few people high incomes and many people low incomes , but even the proportions involved are practically constant ; in other words , the shape of the income pyramid , the degree of inequality , is permanent ? a palpably untrue proposition . How great is the difference in this respect between the Britain of 1950 and the Britain of 193 5 ? how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the latter ! But Pareto does not see variability in economic life , and so he can not use it for the explanation of social change . The derivations on their part do change , yet , as we have seen , they can not explain anything . They are powerless , indicators of real forces , but not real forces themselves . So we arrive at the residues . These are indeed real ; these are in truth the principal factors in the social equilibrium ; but when it comes to the explanation of social change , they , too , fail us . For residues ( i.e. inborn instincts ) change extremely slowly , if they change at all , and therefore it would seem that they make for an abiding , not an evolving or revolving social pattern , that a dramatic event such as the French Revolution can not possibly be explained with their help . As the reader can see , Pareto has succeeded all too well in his attempt to abolish history . He is obliged to bring it in again after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account somehow for change within a theoretical framework which , being mechanistic , can not really accommodate it . The solution which he offers is certainly ingenious , but it is altogether artificial . All it proves is that he can not think in terms of history at all .  | Pareto 's theory of change is known as the circulation of elites ' . What a society is like , depends not on its people at large so much as on its governing class . If all those whom nature has fitted for domination showed the same basic drives , revolutions would not occur . But , as we have seen , drives ? residues ? are of two kinds . There is the kind described as class I ( plus III ) , and there is the kind described as class II ( plus IV and V ) . The former produces a type of man who is best characterised as a schemer . He lives by his wits ; he plots and plans and chops and changes . The latter produces a type of man who is deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always ready to oppose innovation by force . If the governing group were composed of both class I and class II men , all would be well . But every governing group tends to close its gates to people who are evidently not their own kind . Thus there is apt to spring up a contrast , and in due course a conflict , between the governing ' and the non-governing ' elite . And this situation manifestly carries in it the seeds of revolution . Suppose a certain country has a governing class , A , that assimilates the best elements , as regards intelligence , in the whole population ' , Pareto writes . In that case the subject class , 13 , is largely stripped of such elements and can have little or no hope of ever overcoming the class A so long as it is a battle of wits . If intelligence were to be combined with force , the dominion of the A 's would be perpetual . . . But . . . in the majority of cases people who rely on their wits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice versa . So concentration in the class A of the individuals most adept at chicanery class I men leads to a concentration in class B of the individuals most adept at violence class II men ; and if that process is long continued , the equilibrium tends to become unstable , because the A 's are long in cunning but short in the courage to use force and in the force itself ; whereas the B 's have the force and the courage to use it , but are short in the skill required for exploiting those advantages . But if they chance to find leaders who have the skill ? and history shows that such leadership is usually supplied by dissatisfied A 's ? they have all they need for driving the A 's from power ' 02190 ) . A revolution then ensues . And a revolution can , of course , also happen if the B 's are in power and the A 's are not . The mechanism of change will , in principle , be the same .  | This , in briefest outline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What takes place is that the ins become the outs , and the outs become the ins . One could describe this as the see-saw theory of history . When the one side goes up , the other goes down , and vice versa . But if we spoke of a see-saw theory of history , we should be using a misnomer . For there is no real history here , no real development , there is only a rearrangement of pre-existing elements . A see-saw is the same kind of mechanism as a pair of scales . There can be a new adjustment of the scales or sides to each other ; there can be change inside the system we call a pair of scales or a see-saw ; but there can be no change of the systems so described . They are dead , not alive ; they are static , not dynamic . They are , properly considered , not inside time at all , in so far as time implies change , as it must when the term is used in a historical ( or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that Pareto 's change is no change at all , but really repetition . His model of history is not one whit more realistic than his model of society . What happens in history is not that ins become outs and outs become ins , but that entirely new classes appear on the scene who initiate new experiments in social living . There is no circulation , but forward movement . There is no jumping from equilibrium position to equilibrium position , but constant flow and constant birth . A mind like Pareto 's , caught in the coils of mechanicism , can not see this . The utmost it can achieve ( and the utmost that Pareto did achieve ) is to envisage change on the model of the movements of the figures on the chess-board . These figures can shift in relation to each other , and therefore a new look can come over the game . But underneath all remains as before . Nothing substantially new can enter in . Above all , the rules of the game remain unaltered . But this is not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is not only a readjustment of positions , but also a redrafting of the rules . Every new society is , if we may so express it , a new kind of game . Compared to Spencer 's organicism , Pareto 's mechanicism may , on the surface , appear more rational . In truth , however , the choice between them is that between Tweedledum and Tweedledee . One pair of distorting spectacles is no better , though perhaps no worse , than any other . What we need is to see straight .  | is been our endeavour to show that organicism has produced , not only some primary , but also some secondary manifestations , that is to say , theories which , without being ? like organicism proper ? elaborations of the body-metaphor , yet belong within the same ambit of thought . We must now attempt to do the same for mechanicism , and we shall again begin by looking at a rather peripheral phenomenon , utilitarianism . Bentham 's relation to the mechanistic tradition is perhaps no more obvious than Marx 's to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less real . In his Essay on Political Tactics , Bentham appears to condemn all metaphorical language in the social sciences . His words are so striking that they would almost deserve to stand as a motto to this book : The imaginations of writers have been stretched to give to political bodies the properties of different kinds of bodies . Sometimes they are mechanical bodies ; and then it is a question of levers and springs , of wheelwork , of shocks , of friction , of balancing , of preponderance . Sometimes they are animated bodies ; and then they have borrowed all the language of physiology : they speak of health , of sickness , of vigour , of imbecility , of corruption , of dissolution , of sleep , of death and resurrection ' . Such figurative language . . . is mischievous ' , Bentham writes . It accustoms us to reason upon the most false analogies and gathers round the truth a mist which the most enlightened minds are scarcely able to penetrate . ' '  | These are golden words . But Bentham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemns organicism , but he is far from condemning mechanicism , though he appears to avoid its metaphors . He defines , in the very same context , a body politic as an assembly or collection of individuals , inasmuch as they are found united together in order to perform a common act , ' and this definition is pure nominalism . Indeed , in the next lines , he approaches very closely to the concept of contra ' social : That which constitutes a political body , is the concurrence of many members in the same act . It is therefore clear that the act of an assembly can only be a declarative act ? an act announcing an opinion or a will . Every act of an assembly must begin by being that of a single individual : but every declarative act , the expression of an opinion or of a will . . . may finish by being that of a body . " This " , says Titius , " is what passes in my mind . " " This is precisely what has passed in mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , the power of agreeing in the same intellectual act which constitutes the principle of unity in a body ! ' In view of this attitude , it is hardly surprising that Bentham at times forgets his own warnings and slips into the language of mechanicism after all . Whatsoever . . . be the aggregate mass of the matter of good existing in the community in question , ' he writes on June 9 , 1816 , it is the interest . . . of each member of the community . . . to have the whole of it . But . . . no one of them will ever find it in his power to give effect to this his abstract self-regarding interest . Each man 's abstract interest finds in .. . the abstract interests of all the others so many counteracting interests . . . Thus it is that in urging him to the use , enjoyment and preservation with relation to what he has been accustomed to use , or to expect to have it in his power to use , as his own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainspring of a watch : while in his endeavours to extend his occupation beyond the limits of his own property , he finds himself counteracted by as many conflicting interests as there are men in the community , performing , each of them , within its own field or sphere , the office of a regulator in that ingenious piece of mechanism .  | But the mechanistic conception of society is far more to Bentham than an occasional embellishment of his books : it constitutes the very basis of his programme of social reform . He was deeply impressed by the fact that a penny or a pound means far more to a poor man than to a rich , and concluded from this that the ideal system of distribution would be strictly egalitarian . Egalitarianism , however , has a mortal weakness : it kills incentive . Only where a man can reap the reward of his efforts , only where his efforts can raise him above the common level , will there be a flourishing production ? will there be anything to distribute . Therefore we must not insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellence . But if we can not maximise equality , we can at least minimise inequality and inhibit the tendencies towards it . This is what we should do . Bentham 's over-all social programme was the gentle reduction of the rich , and the gradual raising of the poor , to the middling level . The first he wanted to achieve by the egalitarian treatment of inheritances : equal per capita distribution among all the children , which would mean the breaking up of accumulated masses of wealth . The second he endeavoured to bring about by the stimulation of savings , a subject to which he devoted his best thought . Thus his final aim coincided ? not in the detail , of course , but in its outline ? with that of Rousseau : a society of petty producers in which everybody could rise in the social scale , but only in accordance with his merit , and only within the framework of his life . The children were , in all regular cases , to return to a lower level , to start more or less where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely egalitarian as well as libertarian , and it would constantly renew that equality ? that equilibrium of individual forces ? which liberty was constantly tending to destroy . As can be seen , Bentham was in the last analysis as much of a normative mechanicist as Marx was a normative organicist . Drawing nearer now to the main-stream of mechanistic thought , we propose to look first at an attempt to model the science of society on a special kind of mechanics , the mechanics of the heavenly bodies , vulgo astronomy . Henry Charles Carey pursued this possibility with much vigour ( though with little common sense ) in his Principles of Social Science ( 3 volumes , 185 8-1859 ) . Like other protagonists of this point of view , Carey tells us that man is the molecule of society ' . But , unlike others , he is inclined  | to emphasize the gregarious nature of man , even calling man of all animals . . . the most gregarious ' , and to that extent he recalls Wilfred Trotter . Yet , characteristically , he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is born destitute . . . of the instinct that in other animals takes the place of reason ' . What then holds men together in society ? The answer is : the law of molecular gravitation ' ( I , pp. 41 , 42 ) . By itself , this phrase might be no more than a metaphorical way of expressing the fact of sociality , but in Carey unfortunately it is more , far , far more . All the corollaries of the physical principle of gravitation are assumed by him to apply to social gravitation ' as well . Gravitation is here , as everywhere else in the material world , in the direct ratio of the mass , and in the inverse one of the distance ' , Carey assures us . The greater the number collected in a given space , the greater is the attractive force there exerted , as is seen to have been the case with the great cities of the ancient world , Niniveh and Babylon , Athens and Rome , and is now seen in regard to Paris and London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston ' ( pp. 42 , 43 ) . Gravitation thus creates foci of human aggregation , and these are the human homologues of the heavenly bodies . Why is it , ' Carey asks ( a very apposite question ! ) , that all the members of the human family do not tend to come together on a single spot of earth ? Because ' , he answers , of the existence of the same simple and universal law by means of which is maintained the beautiful order of the system of which our planet forms a part . We are surrounded by bodies of various sizes , and some of these are themselves provided with satellites , each having its local centre of attraction , by means of which its parts are held together . Were it possible that that attractive power could be annihilated , the rings of Saturn , the moons of our earth and of Jupiter , would crumble to pieces and fall inward upon the bodies they now attend , a mass of ruins . . . So it is throughout our world . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards which men gravitate , some exercising less influence , and others more . London and Paris may be regarded as the rival suns of our system , each exercising a strong attractive force , and were it not for the existence of the counter-attraction of local centres like Vienna and Berlin , Florence and Naples , . . . Europe would present to view one great centralized system , the population of which was always tending towards those two cities ... ' ( p. 43 ) .  | Here we have the outlines of Carey 's astro-sociology or socioastronomy . We see how deeply it has penetrated Carey 's mind when we consider what he says about the family . He muses about the possible ? nay , certain ! ? consequences of an attempt artificially to centralise America under a strong capital city . The effect would be the same as would be produced in the astronomical world by a similar course of operation . The local governments would fall to pieces , and all the atoms : of which they had been composed , would tend at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced . . . Further , with the growth of centralization , there would be seen a diminution in the counteracting force by which families are held together , despite the attractions of the capital . Whatever tends to the establishment of decentralization , and to the production of local employment for time and talent , tends . . . to enable parents and children to remain in closer connection with each other . . . Whatever tends , on the contrary , to the dimunition of local employment , tends to .. . the breaking up of families ' ( pp. 43-45 ) . If these sentences still sound sane , the following will perhaps show that they are not : The stronger the ties that bind together the members of the various families of which the community is composed , the more perfect will be their revolution on their own axes ... ' ( p. 45 ) . Carey 's meaning is not very clear ; presumably he means : the more self-contained will the families be ( though even this interpretation makes the statement tautological ) . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly objectionable . To express social facts through astronomical language can lead only to darkness , never to light . Still , it is not the language so much that one must condemn , obfuscating though it be ; it is the thought in , or rather behind , it . If Carey were right , if in society , as in space , gravitation ' were in inverse ratio to the distance , then a town would have to be more attractive to those near to it than to those far from it ? London , for instance , more attractive to the people of Kent than to those of Westmorland . This is complete nonsense . Carey bases himself on one axiomatic conviction , namely that if a proposition is true in astronomy , it must be true in sociology also . The word must ' is badly misused here . There is no such must . Carey is about as rational as an architect would be , if he tried to build a skyscraper on a piece of cardboard .  | However , Carey uses the concept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human sense . We are justified in saying that a farmer is ( socially ) distant from a lawyer , as we are in saying that London is ( spatially ) distant from New York , and Carey is not unaware of the fact that the former type of distance ' is more interesting for the sociologist than the latter . The greater the human differences , the wider also the possibilities of social intercourse , which is but the act of exchanging ideas and services ' ( p. 198 ) . In chapter VIII , On the Formation of Society ' , where this is discussed , the scientific jargon is almost innocuous : In the inorganic world we find the power of combination growing with the increase of differences . . . Place a thousand atoms of oxygen in a receiver , and they will remain motionless ; but introduce a single atom of carbon , and excite their affinities for each other , and at once motion will be produced . . . Such being the case in regard to all other matter , it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , indicated by the term society . . . So , in fact , it is ? association increasing with the increase of differences , and diminishing with any diminution therein . . . Among purely agricultural communities , association scarcely exists ; whereas it is found in a high degree where the farmer , the lawyer , the merchant , the carpenter , the blacksmith , the mason , the miller .. and the maker of engines are constituting portions of the community ' ( p. ' 99 ) . Carey is here in sight of a sound and solid sociological insight , namely , that social coherence is different in societies with undeveloped and with developed division of labour ? both quantitatively and qualitatively different . The neighbours in a primitive agricultural village live side by side , but have otherwise little to do with each other ; each is turned in his work towards nature rather than towards his fellow-men . The inhabitants of a modern industrial and commercial country on the other hand have regular recourse to the market and must do so ; each is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is towards nature . Durkheim suggested that social integration in the former case might be called mechanical , in the latter organic , and that the drift of history was from the one to the other . Carey understood both this distinction and this drift . Indeed , in discussing development , he appears for a moment to abandon that addiction to astronomy , physics and chemistry which is otherwise so characteristic of his approach .  | Combination in the inorganic world takes place in accordance with fixed and immutable laws ' , he says . There , however , the bodies that combine have always , and in all places , the same power of combination ? the atom of oxygen of the day of the Pharaohs having been precisely the same in composition as that of those of Lavoisier and Davy . With man , the case is different . Capable of progress , his faculties become developed . . . as his mind is stimulated into action by the habit of association with his fellow-man . With him , therefore , the power of combination is a growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A hopeful development , this , in Carey 's mind . But , alas ! Hopes are no sooner raised than dashed . A few more lines , and Carey is back in his strait-jacket . In the inorganic world , every act of combination is an act of motion .. . So it is in the social one . . . If it is true that there is but one system of laws for the government of all matter , then those which govern the movements of the various inorganic bodies should be the same with those by which is regulated the motion of society ; and that such is the case can readily be shown ' ( p. zoo ) . Now , to have motion , there must be heat , and the greater the latter , the more rapid will be the former ' . In the physical universe , heat is engendered by friction . Consequently , the case must be the same in the social world . The particles ' must rub together here , as they do there . The rubbing together of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement , is the interchange of goods , services and ideas . The brisker this interchange , the greater the caloric and kinetic effects . In the material world , motion among the atoms of matter is a consequence of physical heat ... In the moral world , motion is a consequence of social heat ? motion . . . consisting in " an exchange of relations " resulting from the existence of those differences that develop social life . Motion is greatest in those communities in which agriculture , manufactures and commerce are happily combined ... That such is the fact will be obvious to all who see how rapid is the spread of ideas in those countries in which agriculture , manufactures , and commerce are combined , compared with that observed in those which are purely agricultural . . . In the one there is great heat and corresponding motion , and the more motion , the greater is the force . In the other there is little heat , but little motion , and very little force ' ( pp. 90 , 91 and 6i ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | of the whole astronomical and mechanistic approach to social life . Its essential submission is the assertion that development is due , not to human effort , but to the automatic effect of certain external circumstances or events . It comes about in the manner in which a flame is produced when a match is struck against the side of the box . Surely , there are few who would accept this theory of culturegrowth as realistic . But then the whole idea of social heat ' is no more than a downright absurdity . Carey , as even his friends will have to admit , was a comparatively simple mind : only a simple mind could produce so naive a theory . The man whom we have to consider now was anything but simple : Georg Simmel . As we shall see in later chapters , Simmel was one of those who led sociology out of the impasse into which the age-old , never resolved , and never-to-be resolved , conflict between realism and nominalism had manoeuvred it . His insistence that society is neither a quasi-thing ( like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely mental summing-up ) , but a system of relations , provided a sound starting-point for a better sociology . But there was another facet to Simmel 's social theory : his formalism . It was his considered opinion that sociology is concerned , not with social life in all its colour and variety , but only with its form : not with the picture as a whole , so to speak , but only with the outlines . This narrowing down of the science led Simmel into the rank of the nominalists ? a by no means necessary development . There is a curious parallel and contrast between Simmel and Durkheim : both belonged to the centre party , the party which did not forget the unity of society in the diversity of its members , nor the diversity of its members in the unity of society . But both deviated from this middle line , Durkheim to the right , towards sociological realism , Simmel to the left , towards sociological nominalism . It is with the individualistic , nominalistic Simmel that we have to deal here . Already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1908 ) Simmel makes it sufficiently clear that he is , to say the least , an anti-organicist . Whence comes the curious tendency to regard societies as substantial wholes , he asks ? as something which they obviously are not ? And he answers : this false theory is essentially a continuation and reflection of the practical power which the masses have gained ,  | in the nineteenth century , vis-d-vis the interests of the individual ' . Sociological realism is therefore a by-product of the class struggle , an ideology and not the truth . Contemptuously he calls the realistic definition of society a hypostatisation of a mere abstraction ' ( p. 11 ) . If this were no more than a criticism of , say , Spencer , it would be unexceptionable and welcome . But Simmel seems as little able to keep within the bounds of common sense as Spencer himself . Not satisfied with saying that a body social is not a unitary formation , he asserts that a body physical is not a unitary formation either . He tries to carry the war into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly overestimates his strength and gets beaten for his pains . Microscopy , he claims , has revealed that life in the proper sense of the word , fundamental life , ' consists in ' innumerable processes which ply between the smallest elements of which the macroscopic ones such as organs are merely summations ' 1 ( p. zo ) . Only when the individual processes inside organisms , whose sum or texture constitutes life , were investigated , only when it was recognised that life consists merely in these special happenings in and between organs and cells , did the science of life gain firm ground under its feet ' ( p. z ) . Does Simmel really try to tell us that physiologists nowadays do not , and need not , study wholes like liver and heart ? We have seen above ( cf. p. 89 ) that , for a typical organicist like Radcliffe-Brown , the individual consists of two realities : his physical organism and his social role . For a typical nominalist like Simmel , there is yet a third reality : the personality . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship between the sexes . Powerful forces push man and woman towards each other , and their contrast , being a case of complementarity , helps rather than hinders their union . But even here no real unity is achieved : duality proves irreducible . It remains impossible for the ego truly and absolutely to apprehend the non-ego ' ( p. 86 ) . The hard core of the self will not dissolve . No wonder that Simmel describes man in one passage as the immediate concrete locus of all historical reality ' ( p. 6 ) , and in another as the atom of society ' , and speaks of elements which incessantly gain , lose and shift their equilibrium ' ( pp. 19,20 ) . But it is not in the direction of mechanics that Simmel is  | pushing , it is in the direction of geometry . There is no doubt that he was to some extent ? to a large extent ? activated by the same sentiment as Pareto : the hatred of history . To get rid of variation and variability , he made sociology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only contents do , and if content is disregarded , then there remains a subject for sociology ( one can hardly say , a subject-matter ) which admits of statements of quasimathematical validity . Now , the divorce of form and content is most radically carried out by geometry : geometry studies the triangle in the abstract , not concrete triangles of wood or iron , red or blue colour , thick or thin material . In the same way , Simmel thought , sociology should study the abstract group of three , the triad , not concrete ternary groups of husband , wife and child , or plaintiff , defendant and judge . What can we say about the group of three in general , that was the question which Simmel tried to answer . If Carey fancied himself as the Newton of sociology , Simmel , in so far as he was a formalist , wanted to be its Euclid . There are many passages which allow us to see that Simmel is in fact modelling his sociology on geometry . Perhaps the clearest occurs on page I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , we are told there , can we grasp , what in society is really " society " , just as only geometry determines what in spatial things is really their spatiality . Sociology as the study of the social existence of humanity . . . is related to the other specialized sciences in the same way as geometry is to the physical and chemical sciences of matter : it investigates form , through which alone matter is made into observable bodies ? form which , taken by itself , exists only in the abstract , just like the forms of sociation ' . It is true that Simmel protests on the same page that he is not inclined to drive the analogy between sociology and geometry beyond the bounds of reason . But this protest loses much of its convincingness when we learn that he sees the main difference merely in geometry 's smaller and sociology 's greater measure of complication . For , as we have remarked once before , in our chapter on Pareto , to say that there is a distinction in degree between two sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence . Where does all this formalism lead Simmel ? It leads him to the conviction that the quality of a society depends upon ? nay is , technically speaking , a function of ? its quantity . He looks at  | several aspects of this assumed relationship , but one is particularly important . As we are self-centred and socialised beings at the same time , we do not bring our whole selves into the social nexus . How much of it do we , in fact , bring into it ? This , Simmel tells us , depends on the numerical size of the society concerned : much , if the society is small , little , if it is large . He asserts that the wide circle favours individual freedom , and the narrower cuts it down ' ; that the larger group has fewer demands on us and cares less about the individual , and therefore hinders the full development even of perverted tendencies less , than the smaller ' ( pp. 725 , 727 ) . It is all a matter of numbers . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss this suggestion without abandoning formalism . Who would say that a group of two business partners is ever as closely knit as a dyad of husband and wife ? To give Simmel 's supposed statistical correlation some semblance of truth , it is necessary to restrict it to the inclusive society . The medieval town of , say , 5000 souls was certainly more closely integrated than the modern town of some 500,000 or 5,000,000 inhabitants . To that extent there is something to Simmel 's law . Yet it is utterly untrue that number is the only determinant involved here . One of Simmel 's own examples proves him wrong . The Renaissance , he tells us , brought a strong upsurge of individualism and at the same time a widening of frontiers , a cosmopolitanism such as that expressed in Dante 's phrase that the world is his fatherland as the sea is of fishes ( pp. 731 , 732 ) . In fact , however , the upsurge of individualism in the Renaissance is correlated with a closing of social circles . Is it not the heyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had broken out of the totality of Christendom , not the city state embedded in it as the town of the thirteenth century had been . Florence meant more to Machiavelli ( who died in 1527 ) than it had meant even to Savonarola ( who had been executed in 1498 ) . Dante , born in 1265 , was , as Simmel ought to have remembered , a type of medievalism , not one of incipient modernity . His dream of the universal empire alone bears witness to this fact , if nothing else ? a dream which Machiavelli , the aider and abetter of the power-hungry petty princeling , did not share . Thus the contraction of the social framework of life may , if the circumstances are favourable , lead to a rampant individualism . Since Simmel 's day , the opposite has also happened : mass societies have , against his assertions , brought  | a dwindling of individual freedom . The Germans of 1936 had assuredly less privacy than their forefathers of 1786 . Yet the population of Germany was far , far larger in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely an effect of totalitarianism which might be written off as an exception to the rule . Even in democratic countries we observe similar tendencies : radio , television , advertising , propaganda , and all the other forms of mass communication , have led to a formerly unheard-of lack of individuality in the average man which goes hand in hand with a rapidly increasing population . Simmel 's belief that number is the cause and culture the effect is simply erroneous , a clear proof that his whole approach , his whole geometrical model , is inappropriate . We have , in the foregoing pages , occasionally used the term atomism ' and meant thereby a conception of society which sees it as essentially a multiplicity , i.e. a collection of man-atoms or animated monads . In this sense its import coincides to all intents and purposes with that of the more colloquial word ' individualism ' . But there is another , more restricted and technical usage of the term with which historians of philosophy have often operated . In their mouths , the term atomism ' describes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to see reality as a whole in terms of these ultimate building stones , elements or atoms . A good deal of recent philosophical speculation has been of this kind . Casting about for some absolute bedrock of certainty , the members of an influential school have found it in our sense-perceptions , the reality of which we can not possibly doubt . If I see a thing , I see it . What more can I want ? As for more complex phenomena , these can conveniently be conceived as configurations of sense-perceptions . No objective reality need be ascribed to them : they can be defined as verbal summings-up of simple ( and indubitably real ) elements . Thus we have on the one hand the absolute reliability of the simple senseperceptions , and on the other the mere conventionality of the words which describe more than simple sense-perceptions . There is , or rather there appears to be , no point at which uncertainty can enter the picture and begin to plague us : the spectre of metaphysics is exorcised for ever . It is not surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of the fact that it does not solve the enigmas of life , but merely defines them away : and  | it is not surprising that it should have found ardent disciples among sociologists . Perhaps the two most remarkable are George Lundberg , with his Foundations of Sociology ( 1939 ) , and Stuart Dodd , with his Dimensions of Society ( 1942 ) . It can not be our task here to discuss their system ( in many respects a rather refined one ) in Iota . What we have to do is merely to show that it is a new ? and higher ? form of sociological nominalism ? ' higher ' because it atomises not only society , but even man , in other words , because even man is not allowed to be an ultimate at which social analysis can be permitted to stop . This shows the whole radicalism of this nominalistic philosophy . Degrees , calories , ergs ' , writes Lundberg , are words symbolizing sensory responses . ' " Man " is just another such word . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? upon the sense organs of the perceiver . It is only when there is relative stability and uniformity in the sensory responses of numerous competent observers that we can postulate either his existence or his unitary nature with reference to the attendant situation to which we also respond ' ( p. 70 ) . If Lundberg is thus doubtful about the propriety of ascribing unitary character to man ( whom , after all , we can see and touch ) , it is not surprising , indeed , it is only logical , that he should be more than doubtful about the propriety of ascribing unitary character to a group of plurel ' ( which we can neither see nor touch ) . Society ' is to him , not an entity which nature or history have established , but only a portmanteau word which the observing mind has formed for purposes of speedy locution , a definitional trick , an artefact , a classificatory device . Group designations , like other classifications , are not to be regarded as inherent divisions given in nature ' , he writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to phenomena according to some criteria of similarity or difference or other aspect and .. . therefore . . . no classification has any intrinsically greater reality or existence than any other . ' And he quotes with approval the statement of his comrade-in-arms , E. E. Eubank : Between the objects themselves there need not be , and frequently is not , the slightest degree of contact or even proximity . The basis of their being clustered in thought is that some point of similarity , real or supposed , leads the mind to include them in a common context  | This means , if it means anything , that the concept the Italian people ' has no more ground in life than the concept all those who have hare lips ' . But it is easy to see that such an attitude makes a sound sociology from the very first moment utterly impossible . All those who have hare lips ' appear as a group only in the records of the medical statistician , and of their case it can truly be said that the nature of the units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 234 ) . But the Italian people are one , not only because they share certain assignable characteristics on the basis of which the statistician can count them , but also because they co-operate with each other , exchange goods and services , elect a common parliament to rule them , fight shoulder to shoulder in a war , etc. etc . Thus it is not only the observing mind that connects them , but also continuing , and very real , lifeprocesses , and as these life-processes lie in the centre of the sociologist 's field of interest , Lundberg 's approach is apt to blind him to what really matters . In other words , his nominalism is excessive and ought to be resisted and rejected . While this philosophical tendency , and especially its unrestrained radicalism , gives Lundberg a personal and peculiar characteristic , a good deal of his book is simply a modernised version of that rather mechanical imitation of contemporary physics which we have already observed in Carey and Pareto . The following quotations show this with all desirable clarity : At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly in terms of the hypothetical elements electrons and protons . The properties ascribed to these units are attraction and repulsion of their own kind . That is , electrons move towards protons and away from other electrons ; protons move toward electrons and away from other protons . The magnitude of the attraction or the repulsion is some inverse function of the distances between the particles . The arrangement of the electrons and protons into various types of groups of different symmetrical relations to each other constitutes matter . . . . The social sciences are concerned with the behaviors of those electron-proton configurations called societal groups . . . . It is sometimes convenient to use different words to designate behavior mechanisms of different systems or levels of electron-proton configuration . But certain basic concepts of motion , energy , and force are equally applicable to all behavior . . . . From the point of view we  | have adopted , any situation in which we choose to observe association or dissociation is regarded as a field of force .. . Societal activities are fundamentally forms of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 231 ) . When we read these sentences carefully , we soon see that the link which Lundberg has established between the science which he has really made his own , physics , and the science which he professes to serve , sociology , is the weakest of all possible links ? a purely verbal one . We can , if we like , say both of electrons and protons and of human beings that they behave ' . But the word behaviour ' merely masks an abyss , or rather pretends to mask it , for it is all too obvious . Lundberg himself admits that the interaction of physical particles and the interaction of human beings are different in kind . Interaction among human beings ' , he frankly concedes , is recognized as being in at least one respect highly unique . It is unique in that it takes place by means of the mechanism of communication through symbolic behavior ' ( pp. z 5 2 /3 ; cf. also 177 /8 ) . This is tantamount to saying that electron-proton and human behavior ' have as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word is pronounced , Cockney-fashion , without the initial h . There are many other aspects of Lundberg 's thought which show his enslavement to mechanistic modes of thought , for instance his comparison of society with a machine where he discusses the problems of social reform ( cf. pp. 2o6 , 207 ) , but we can not possibly scrutinize them all . The upshot is always the same . On reading his book and observing his intellectual alertness and acuteness , one can not help regretting that he has taken sociology as his chosen field , and not physics or engineering where men of his mental type are much more at home .  | WHEN THE social historian looks back over the nineteenth century , he finds that few developments have made a deeper impression on the human mind than the discovery , study and large-scale utilisation of electricity . Not only did it , almost magically , transform everyday life , but it also seemed to promise new and more profound insights into the mysterious workings of the material universe . Was the energy which made the light-bulb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as physical , and ? daring thought ! ? mental as well as vital ? True scientists did not , of course , go quite so far , but even they began to speculate with more vigour than ever before about the unity of nature . Michael Faraday , for instance , surmised that light , warmth and electricity were merely different forms of one and the same natural force , and , more boldly still , suggested that electricity and gravity were somehow connected , even though we are as yet unable to perceive the link . Experiments designed to identify that link misfired , yet Faraday retained the conviction that it existed , that there was unity in nature , or at least in the energy system of nature , its power economy . In view of these preoccupations of the scientists ? Maxwell followed later on in his master 's footsteps ? it is not surprising that some sociologists ' ( one must use the word here in inverted commas ) should have renewed the effort to squeeze social phenomena into the framework of physics and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood as manifestations of the force of which electricity was the  | archetype . Henry Charles Carey was once again in the forefront . Thirteen years after the completion of his Principles of Social Science ? i.e. in 1872 ? he presented the world with another book which bore the highly characteristic title : The Unity of Law ; as exhibited in the Relations of Physical , Social , Mental and Moral Science . Capping his own absurdity , he followed his astro-sociology by what one can only describe as an attempted electro-sociology . There is no evidence that Carey abandoned any of his fundamental convictions between writing the Principles of Social Science and writing The Unity of Law ; indeed , chapter III of the later book ( Of Man ? the Subject of Social Science ' ) is for several pages a literal repetition of the corresponding sections of the earlier work . But his approach has become more taut and technically scientific ' . From being a comparatively moderate mechanicist , advancing age had made him an extreme and reckless one . As befits a would-be nineteenth-century physicist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his point of departure as well as his point of constant return . What others only surmised and thought possible , he regards as proven , namely that this law is the key to all phenomena encountered in reality , be they physical or mental , vital or social : But recently discovered , it seems now to have become the crown of the edifice of that great system of law by means of which harmony is secured throughout the whole range of matter , from coral insects which build up islands destined to form the nuclei of continents , to the innumerable suns with their attendant planets , of which the universe is composed . ' Man , situated half-way between the smallest insects and the vastest suns , must obey , in all he is and in all he does , the same principles as they do : for what else is he but matter vitalised and become conscious ? There can not be two sciences ; there can only be one : the idea of an unity of law ' is the necessary complement . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that of unity of force ' ( pp. 122 and V ) . The sociologist , like the physicist , must therefore ask himself : what is force ? And the sociologist , along with the physicist , must recognise that it is , in whatever form we encounter it , a primal energy of which electricity is the archetype . Heat , light , . . . magnetism , and chemical affinity . . . the new philosophy resolves all these subtle agencies into modes of motion , asserting that they are all capable of mutual conversion , ' indeed , that they are one  | and the same force ' . The consequences of this fact for sociology are tremendous . If it is to remain abreast of scientific developments , it must cease to think in terms of gravitation and learn to think in terms of electricity : The identity and convertibility of these subtlest of forces have abundantly justified the analogies which had thus far been assumed between the heat and motion of matter and the forces of societary life , but the choice of electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger and happier application of the correspondence ' ( pp. 116 , 117 ) . What is it that happens when man meets man , when Robinson Crusoe meets , for the first time , Friday ? Let him have a companion ' , Carey answers , and at once ... the opposing electric states of consumers and producers , givers and receivers , teachers and learners , having been induced , as air awakens the quiescent lungs , and as light kindles and informs the eye , the real man is then coming into existence ' ( p. 126 ) . The real man is social man ; but sociality is electricity ; and so it is that humanity , even in its highest and finest manifestations , springs from the basic force of all that exists , the very mainspring of reality . Once again , Carey compares the rubbing along of men in society to the rubbing together of hard objects , but this time it is all interpreted in the vein of electro-mechanics . Rubbing and rubbed bodies require opposite electricities , the contact and interaction requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alkali . That contact is combination , not mere aggregation ? distinctive individuality being here , as in every department of societary life , the condition of perfect association . Substances assume vitreous or resinous electricity in adjustment to the conditions or capacities acting or acted upon . Woollen cloth is strongly vitreous with zinc , but with gold or iron it is resinous . Such mutations occur in all electric bodies , varying in their intensities , also , under the influence of diversely related substances . Here again do we find a beautiful correspondence with the law of societary association ? an infinitely varying adaptation to , and influence upon , the infinitely varied individualities required for giving rapidity to the societary circulation ' ( pp. 118 , 119 ) . From this interpretation of association between individual and individual , Carey advances with giant 's steps to an equally electrotechnical interpretation of the social system as a whole : The production of electricity , or its excitation for use , requires order and  | relations that are full of suggestiveness to those who desire fully to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and permanent societary life . Zinc and copper plates promiscuously piled are mere rubbish , powerless as the fragments of any other waste . Let them , however , be connected in orderly alternation , and the range may continue indefinitely with increase of latent force , ready upon the instant when the circuit shall be completed to gather together at one extremity the whole accumulated negative , and at the other the whole accumulated positive , and thus present an active force sufficient to bind and unbind the elements of matter ... This force of immeasurable and resistless energy flows silently , gently , imperceptibly , through perfect conductors , supplying its currents of vitality to the whole organic world . Disturbed , resisted , or misdirected , it blasts and crushes , on the contrary , every obstacle encountered in its course ; and here , again , do we find a perfect correspondence to the social force . The actual relation of each and every member of a community , as giver and receiver , teacher and learner , producer and consumer , is positive and negative by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his associates , the whole mass constituting a great electric battery to which each individual contributes his pair of plates . Perfect circulation being established as a consequence of perfect development of all the various individualities , the economic force flows smoothly through every member of the body politic , general happiness and prosperity , improved mental and moral action , following in its train . When , however , by reason of failure on the part of those charged with exercise of the co-ordinating power of the State , the circulation is obstructed , . . . the gentle vital force is converted into thunderbolts whose existence is made manifest by the presence of consuming fires . The broken balance rushes by a pathway of ruin to regain its equilibrium , the war of elements thus presented being the correspondent of the strife engendered by resistance to the laws of human life . ' These sentences are the heart of Carey 's new sociology . Its gist can be summed up by saying that the social order is identical with that orderly arrangement which we see to be required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 126 ) . Remember here , gentle reader , Johann Kaspar Bluntschli and his comparison of the church to a bashful maiden with swelling breasts ! Is Carey 's description of  | Turkey and Ireland as communities in which the human plates are promiscuously piled ' ( p. z zo ) better poetry or worse ? The only answer can , surely , be that both are about as absurd as can well be imagined . We all must admire modern science ; we all must investigate to what extent physical and social reality can be said to stand under the same laws ; indeed , we all must try to extend the area for which common laws can be formulated , for there is no merit in multiplying the areas of , and magnifying the differences in , reality . But when we ' find supposed social scientists rushing forward as blindly as Bluntschli and Carey did , we must all blush with shame and wince as under the stroke of a lash . There is really no need to delve deeper into this sea of absurdity ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , inclined to be a-historical or even anti-historical , it may just be permissible to say a few words about Carey 's attempt to make his special brand of mechanistic sociology available for an elucidation of the processes of history . Generally speaking , he is a progressivist , even though the law of the conservation of energy would seem to point , or to push , towards a static , rather than towards a dynamic , view of life . Perhaps Carey 's understanding of history is most clearly expressed in the following passage : At each and every step of progress the societary positives and negatives become more intimately connected ; mind acquires new power over matter ; mere brute force tends to yield place to law ; the power and the habit of association become more and more confirmed ; exchanges become more rapid ; values i.e. costs of production decline as utilities become developed ; production increases as consumption follows more instantly on its path ; and each societary atom more and more readily finds the place for which it had been fitted ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those of the community of which it is a part ' ( pp. 174 , 175 ) . This constant , if gradual , reshaping of society until its image comes to coincide with the lay-out of a galvanic battery , will not only improve the workings of the social mechanism , but also the morals of associated men : As . . . societary positives and negatives are brought more and more nearly together , kindly feelings become stimulated into action ; the husband clings more closely to the wife ; the parent feels more and more responsibility for proper care of the little beings by whom he is surrounded ; the master becomes  | more careful of his servant ; he himself , meantime , more and more acquiring that feeling of self-respect which , while forbidding that he should truckle to the strong , prompts him to hold out a helping hand to others who , being poor and weak , stand in need of aid from those who influence the movements of the community of which they are component parts . . . The tendency toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power in mind to control mere brute matter ; that itself growing as the societary positives and negatives are more and more brought into orderly arrangement , and as the interdependence of the various parts becomes more and more complete . The more that tendency asserts itself , the more rapid is the development of that self-respect ? or moral feeling ? which forbids our doing to others that which , under similar circumstances , we should not desire them to do by us ' ( pp. 297-299 ) . Even this last sentiment , innocent or infantile as it may appear , is in the end an outcrop of the supposed scientific spirit : the compliance with the divine decree ' of brotherly love is not to be expected of ethical effort ; it is to be the mechanical effect of a quasi-electrical cause , the bringing together of the societary positives and negatives ' ( pp. 375 , 374 ) . One of the weaknesses of Carey ( if , indeed , it is a weakness in a sociologist ! ) was his comparatively slight acquaintance with physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the educated layman . He even managed to mis-spell the name of the man who classically formulated the law of the conservation of energy . ' Now , the same can certainly not be said of the next author whom we propose to study , Sp . C. Haret , whose Mecanique Sociale appeared in 1910 . Haret was not only a science graduate , but also a professor in the School of Road- andBridge-Building ( and in the University ) of Bucharest . The whole appearance and apparatus of his work shows that we meet in him an expert and not an amateur , and a technician , not a litterateur . Let us first , as a kind of curtain-raiser , consider an example of the style of reasoning in which Haret indulges . Spencer 's great formula of evolution had been that it leads from incoherent homogeneity to coherent heterogeneity . If this view is correct , then , logically , the starting point of development must have been a state of homogeneity , in other words , a kind of equilibrium , for  | homogeneous particles can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . Why should this condition ever have broken up ? In order to answer this question , Spencer asserted that homogeneous masses are inherently unstable ? a flagrant piece of special pleading which did not deceive the scientists of the day . Brunhes , for instance , in his La Degradation de l'Energie ( 1908 , p. 346 ) , had no difficulty in demonstrating that the break-up of the supposed initial equilibrium was ( in the technical sense of the word ) infinitely improbable . Haret , too , tries to prove Spencer wrong , and he does it by the following arguments which show what manner of man he was . Let us consider ' , he writes , a society composed of an indefinite number of perfectly identical individuals , between whom a mutual attraction exists which is inversely proportional to a whole and positive magnitude of their distance , and which is the same for equal distances , whoever the individuals between whom it exists . Let us place these individuals at equal distances from each other , so that each of them finds himself at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summits are occupied by other individuals . In this way , an indefinite series of equal regular tetrahedrons is formed which are joined by one of their surfaces . It is evident that a system thus laid out will be in equilibrium , for each individual will be equally attracted by all those who surround him , and that in directions which are , pairwise , directly opposed to each other . But if a single person A of these individuals is shifted , however slightly , from his equilibrium position so that he approaches , for example , his neighbours on the right , the attraction which these latter exert on him will become stronger than that of the neighbours on the left . The individual concerned will then follow the stronger attraction and join up with his neighbours on the right . This will give rise to a grouping of two or more individuals , whose increased power of attraction will assert itself all around and will destroy the equilibrium which before existed for the neighbouring individuals . Each of them will then yield to the attraction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself with it , a development which will create an even stronger centre of attraction . In this way , this centre of attraction will become ever stronger and stronger and continue to attract to itself . . . all the individuals who compose the mass under consideration . Now this mass was ,  | in its original form , homogeneous and in a state of equilibrium . What we have just said proves that this equilibrium was unstable . But if , instead of a force of attraction , we should have assumed that the force which is at work between the individuals was one of repulsion inversely proportional to the whole and positive measure of the distance , and if we had made the individual A approach his neighbours on the right , however slightly , the repulsion which these latter exerted on him would have increased , whereas that of the neighbours on the left would have diminished . The effect would have been that A , yielding to the stronger action , would , instead of removing further to the right , as in the first case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position which he had left . The equilibrium would therefore have been stable . This example . . . will suffice to prove that Herbert Spencer 's proposition concerning the instability of the homogeneous , which may be correct in certain cases , may also be incapable of verification in certain others ' ( pp. 76 , 78-8o ) . All this is , strictly speaking , true . But what are we to say of the whole deduction in view of the fact that it is supposed to be a discussion of social history ? ! What possible bearing can it have on the problems of evolution ? If . . . if . . . if ! Anything and everything can be proved and disproved in this way . Surely , the social scientist is entitled to a little realism ! Unfortunately , Haret 's whole book is conceived in this style . Even where he expressly undertakes to discuss a concrete social phenomenon , he chooses a phenomenon which is not really social . In his second chapter he sets out to prove that sociological problems can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , and he picks as his example the mortality rate . This rate depends , as he tells us , above all on six factors : age ; the native vigour of the population ; climatic conditions ; hygienic conditions ; soil fertility ; and accidental causes , such as epidemics . Who does not see that all these determinants are physical rather than social ? A small social or human trace appears in determinant number 4 , hygienic conditions , as this depends to some extent on social arrangements and public instruction , but the other five are simply natural , i.e. sub-cultural and sub-social , data . Death is something that happens to men , not something that they do : and for this reason it is anything but a characteristic social fact , for social facts , in the proper sense of the word , are the  | configurations and consequences of human conduct . In view of this , the marriage-rate would have been a far better objectum deronstrationis than the death-rate , for people marry if and when they want to . Now , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external aspects ) can be analysed by similar statistical techniques as the death-rate , but any honest attempt at thorough understanding will lead to the recognition that its basis , its basic reality , is not the same . Such fixity as the marriage-rate shows is due to the persistence of certain human habits , for instance , the habit of marrying around az ? not to the persistence of certain non-human data such as climate and soil fertility . For this reason a true social science must concern itself basically with the problems of custom and convention , and not with those of nature , of rocks and rains and sun and soot . The physical sciences can never be its proper model . There is another context in Haret 's book where his inability , and the inability of all extreme mechanicists , to deal with social facts becomes even more manifest , and we propose to quote the passage concerned in full . It will amply repay close scrutiny . Under the heading Axioms of Social Dynamics ' , the author discusses the principle of inertia and expresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of social rest . This is tantamount to saying that his social position does not change .. . and , in consequence , that he is not subject to any social force , however small ; for , by definition , a social force is a cause which produces social movement ; and as such movement is , by the hypothesis , non-existent , the force does not exist either . Hence the individual , being already at rest , and not being subject to any force , will remain at rest indefinitely ; for if he were to move , he would necessarily have to take some determinate direction ; and there is no reason why he should take any specific direction rather than any other . This conclusion ' , Haret admits , indicating the crucial issue , seems contrary to the reality of things . In fact , if we can accept it in rational dynamics , it is only because matter as such is inert and can move from a state of rest only in response to an impetus which comes from outside . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which forces him to seek for shelter and the means of covering himself , and the need to live in society which imposes on him a certain morality , are indeed social forces which come  | from outside the individual . But hunger , which induces him to lay aside surplus food in view of future days of famine , and his intelligence are the prime factors of his economic and intellectual progress and these are interior to him . Thus it is that an individual left alone on a desert island , will , thanks to his energy and to his intelligence , know how to make use of his resources , which means that he is capable , by his own effort , of bringing about a variation in his social position ' ( pp. 85 , 86 ) . What Haret faces , in these lines , is the double fact which makes it utterly impossible to build up a meaningful social mechanics : the fact that man is endowed with life , and the fact that man is endowed with intelligence and will . Already the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to squeeze human reality into the strait-jacket of rational mechanics , for in rational mechanics effect is always equivalent to cause , whereas in the realm of vitality response is often far in excess of  - -  is certainly not necessarily in numerical proportion to ? stimulus . If Haret had thought about the implications of the contrast which he himself draws , he would have torn up his manuscript and returned to his road-and-bridge-building . But he is unwilling to give up his toy , and he helps himself out of his quandary by the cheapest of all possible tricks ? by assuming it away . The difficulty ' , he writes brazenly , can be easily removed , if one considers intelligence as a simple social force which acts on the individual in precisely the same manner as any other social force . Under this supposition , the individual properly so called is merely an inert element put into social movement by social forces among which we must also count his own intelligence and his own will . In this way , the above conclusion is no longer untrue ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as no social force will intervene , be it his intelligence or his will or any other ' ( pp. 86 , 87 ) . This is essentially a piece of prestidigitation . The disturbing fact is conjured away . But the trick is too poor to deceive anybody . What is it that Haret expects us to assume ? He expects us to assume that the intelligence and the will which are in us , are forces which are outside us and push us from behind . Brutally expressed , he expects us to assume that we are not men at all but puppets who do the bidding of the puppet master . If there were any sense in substituting a Punch-and-Judy-Show for social  | reality as the subject matter and model of the social sciences , we could move ahead in the direction of a social mechanics and expect a reward for our pains . But there is no sense whatever in this . Social science , like any other science , must deal with the facts as they are , and not with fictions , however convenient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sinks down to an empty pastime like billiards or draughts . In the lines which we have quoted , the operative clause is clearly the words ? ' under this supposition , the individual properly so called is merely an inert element ' . One could describe this as the de-animation of the human world . This formula is suggested here because it contrasts most instructively with the animation of the material world with which Aristotle is often ( and rightly ) reproached . The stars are for him , not balls of clay , but little souls that rush across the night sky ; stones , children of the earth who , when they fall , run home to their mother . Modern man is inclined to ridicule these conceptions and deride them as childish , but , like the hypocrite of the Gospel , he sees only the mote in his brother 's eye and not the beam in his own . What Haret does is the same , in a negative way . Aristotle adds life and consciousness where they are not , Haret subtracts them where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and choose between these two equally artificial points of view ? Choosing between them would be like choosing between too hot ' and too cold ' or too little ' and too much ' . Neither alternative can be called just right ' . For Haret , of course , the de-animation of the human world means the removal ? the forcible removal ? of the roadblock in his way . He can now carry on and construct a nlecanique sociale on the pattern of rational mechanics or mechanics proper . Actually his effort is characterised by a certain mental laziness . He simply takes the physicists ' textbook propositions and slightly adjusts them to his purpose . On p. 64 , for instance , we read : If a material system is subject to a system of forces and a number of constraints , and if these forces are in equilibrium , the total virtual work done by these forces is zero for any virtual displacements consistent with the constraints ' . This is followed on p. 65 by this statement : If a social body of any kind is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if these forces are in equilibrium , the total virtual work done by these social forces is zero for any virtual displacements of the social body consistent with the  | constraints ' . In mechanics , this proposition is both meaningful and important ; in sociology it is neither . Indeed , in sociology it is doubtful what possible sense it can have at all . What Haret makes of it , and all that he makes of it , becomes clear from the next lines : In rational mechanics , the constraints imposed on a material system are generally expressed by equations between the ordinates of the material points which compose it ; sometimes they are also expressed by inequalities . In the latter case , the formulation of the principle undergoes a modification in the sense that the sum of virtual velocities becomes zero or negative for all the virtual displacements which are possible in one single direction considered as positive . It is the same , ' Haret asserts , in social mechanics . The conditions imposed on a social body can sometimes be expressed by equations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the severe discipline to which they are subjected , imposes on their social movement such limits that they can not turn aside from the line which is traced out for them and known in advance ; it will be possible to describe this line by means of equations . Under the caste system , the social development of the individual is restricted in some directions , sometimes in all directions ... . Under this regime , the individual can be considered as free to move inside a certain surface to which he can not rise superior . This state of affairs will be expressed by means of inequalities , by writing that , for the given direction , the ordinates of the individual are inferior , or at most equal , to those of the surface point which lies in that direction ' ( pp. 65 , 66 ) . Statements of this kind consist of two elements : a grandiloquent shell and a miserable kernel . When the shell of scientific jargon is peeled off and discarded and the kernel of positive insight exposed , it is seen that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the value , or rather lack of value , of the latter . One is reminded of those miserable hotels in which a sardine for supper is served on a silver platter . All Haret tells us is that army men , monks and Mahars or Mangs are not free . We know that without the help of the concepts of virtual momentum and virtual velocity , without equations and all the rest . Tani de bruit pour tine omelette , as the Frenchman says ! Sometimes , of course , the translation of a proposition or concept of mechanics into sociological terms is not as easy as in the example which we have given . This applies above all to the  | notion of space . We all know what physical space is ; but what can one possibly mean by social space ? Yet Haret needs a concept of social space because , without it , all comparison between sociology and mechanics would be impossible , and , above all , the apparatus of the latter science could not be utilised for the former . So there must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how Haret provides it : We call society or body social a collection of individuals subject , on the one hand , to their reciprocal actions , and on the other to external influences . The individual is the constituent element of the body social for he is indivisible . He plays , in the body social , the same part as the atom does in a material body . A society is essentially variable . . . One might form an idea of these variations , if one had at one 's disposal certain fixed terms of comparison . But in order to find terms of this kind , one must first distinguish the variables on which the state of a society , at a given moment , depends . These variables are in very great number . . . . However , on examining these causes , one sees that they can be ranged into three groups which are : causes of an economic nature ; causes of an intellectual nature ; causes of a moral nature . . . . Given any two individuals , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , even if we mean by this word not only their wealth or poverty , but the totality of the factors which determine the physical and material well-being of each of them . We can then conceive ' , Haret asserts , as a determined magnitude what one might call the economic status ( l'avoir economique ) of the individual . The same applies to his intellectual and moral status ' . This alone is utterly absurd , for what is to give us the required figure ? What is moral status ( eta ' moral ) anyway ? And how can it be quantified ? However , let us hear Haret out . We are not concerned here with minor points , but with the major of all major points , the sociological analogue of the concept of physical space . Let us call ' , Haret continues , social status or social situation of an individual the state defined by the ensemble of the three magnitudes which represent his economic , his intellectual and his moral status . . . . Let us agree , once for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitudes which represent the economic , the intellectual and the moral status of an individual . Let us take three rectangular axes , OX , OY , and OZ , and construct the point M whose ordinates are the values x , y , z relative to a given individual and to  | a given moment . . . . If the position of this point in relation to the axes OX , OY , and OZ is known , we shall automatically know the social situation of the individual , for we know do we ? the values x , y , z which determine that position . The three axes OX , OY , OZ define a space which we may call social space ' ( pp. 42 , 43 , 49 , 50 ) . It is not difficult to see that the word space ' is used here in an altogether fictitious , nay fantastic , sense . Not only is the social space here spoken of no proper space , but it does not even resemble one in any way . Space has three dimensions : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la Haret has also three dimensions ' ? economics , intelligence , and morality . Is economics a kind of length ? Is intelligence a kind of width ? Is morality a kind of height ? Science must , of course , sometimes use concepts and constructs which appear strange at first sight , but they must not , and among true scientists do not , on rational analysis , turn out to be altogether unrealistic , as the use of the word space ' is here . We can , as it happens , leave the last word in this discussion to Haret himself . A mathematical formula ' , he writes , expresses only a relationship between the quantities which were under consideration , and were , so to speak , set in motion , when that formula was established . If one widens the range of its application , and if one lets it speak in cases for which it was not made , it is apt to become a cause of error ' ( p. l25 ) . How very true ! The formula of mechanics were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should never have been transferred to sociology ; and if they were or are so transferred , then , as Haret himself says , they only become a cause of error , at times , indeed , even more : a nuisance . But still more pungent , and still more justly applicable to himself , is another word of his : Human societies have not been called into being in order to satisfy abstract formula ' ( p. 217 ) . It is impossible not to agree with the sentiment expressed in this sentence . What a pity that Haret honoured it in the breach , and not in the observance ! His whole book is a continued outrage of its spirit and wisdom . '  | ANYONE wIIO has read through the last chapter and seen the severe handling that we have meted out to Carey and Haret , will be surprised to hear that a great and , in spite of some addiction to abstract model-building , realistic science has been dominated throughout its history by the mechanistic conception of the social system ? the science of economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the organismic camp : just as some philosophical realism is permissible and has led to fruitful results in the hands of the leading anthropologists , just so some philosophical nominalism is defensible and has helped rather than hindered the leading economists in elucidating the workings of the sector with which they are concerned . What is so repulsive about the extreme mechanicists is not their mechanicism so much as their extremism . In the context of our analysis , a study of economics will help us to recognise and to appreciate the truth-content of sociological nominalism as a whole . With this aspect we shall have to deal in the next chapter . Here we shall have to show that modern economics in its entirety is indeed an incarnation of the nominalistic principle of social philosophy . Our task is relatively easy , for there is far-reaching , not to say universal , agreement on this point . Orthodox economics and mechanistic sociology coincide , and are seen to coincide . Those economists who have embraced sociological realism ? and there are only very few , such as Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economic thinking , disregarded , derided and despised . It can happen that basically mechanistic authors may show here and there some little influence of organismic conceptions ; this is true , above all , of Alfred Marshall . But the holistic passages in their works are like tiny boats on a vast ocean . Both classical economics and neo-classical economics ? the group Adam Smith ? Malthus ? Ricardo and the group Walras ? Menger ? Jevons ? show no such influence at all . Indeed , there is , in these leading theoreticians , some evidence of militant anti-organicism . The only exception to the rule ( which , as we shall see , is apparent rather than real ) is the Physiocratic School , the school of Francois Quesnay . Quesnay fits his economic analysis into an organismic frame . There are three classes who , between them , constitute the economic system : the primary producers , the landowning aristocracy , and the tradesmen and traders . The first are like the stomach of the human body which produces the nutritive juices that feed the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them through the far-flung system , and the last are like the lungs which help the heart to pump , but neither provide nourishment nor yet spread it to , and through , all parts . The economic process is a process of circulation like the circulation of the blood , and there is , according to Quesnay , a physiology and a pathology of the body social , just as there is a physiology and a pathology of the body physical . This sounds very much like consistent organicism , but a close look reveals a somewhat different picture . The years 1758 to 1775 , which delimit the period of physiocratic predominance in France , were years of an allpervading , all-controlling general mechanicism , a mechanicism so supreme that it imposed itself even on the sciences of life . The reader must remember here Lamettrie 's characteristic book , L'Homme Machine , published in 1748 , which Quesnay ( who was a doctor ) must have known inside out . If the model at the basis of contemporary physiology was in this way entirely mechanistic , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary economics must have been mechanistic also . And this we see , in fact , to have been largely the case . Quesnay finds it impossible to remain within his organismic frame , even so far as language is concerned : after having spoken of economic life as a kind of circulation , comparable to that of the blood stream , he changes  | over to mechanistic metaphors and talks of wheels and pumps which push the mass of commodities from stage to stage . His concept of economic health is , properly speaking , a concept of equilibrium , his concept of economic disease one of disequilibrium . In a word , organismic nomenclature here masks mechanistic thought.l The use of this nomenclature has its importance , just as the appearance of some organicism in Alfred Marshall , and we shall have to revert to the point . Here we wish to emphasise that the superficial verbal organicism of Quesnay and his school is no disproof of the fact that economics is all along the way profoundly and substantially mechanistic . The theory of Adam Smith is not complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are easy to recognise , and it reminds one from the first moment onward of the contemporary doctrine of Jean-Jacques Rousseau . Rousseau , as we have seen , reduced the social element in man to a bare minimum , and Smith does exactly the same ; indeed , in The Wealth of Nations ( though not in the earlier Theory of Moral Sentiments ) he goes even a little further . What is it that brings men together in society , in a great system of divided and integrated labour ? This division of labour ' , Smith tells us , . . . is the necessary , though very slow and gradual , consequence of a certain propensity in human nature . . . the propensity to truck , barter , and exchange one thing for another ' ( ed . Cannan , p. 15 ) . This trucking disposition ' ( p. 17 ) is in no way a social instinct : it predisposes men to do business with each other , but its basis is in selfishness and not in sociality . Man has almost constant occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an often-quoted passage , and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only . He will be more likely to prevail if he can interest their self-love in his favour , and shew them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them . Whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind , proposes to do this . Give me that which I want , and you shall have this which you want , is the meaning of every such offer . . . It is not from the benevolence of the butcher , the brewer , or the baker , that we expect our dinner , but from their regard to their own interest . We address ourselves , not to their humanity but to their  | self-love , and never talk to them of our own necessitie$ but of their advantages ' ( p. 16 ) . It is clear already from these words that Smith , like Rousseau , thinks of society in terms of contra ' social . But the point is put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower creation , he says of the trucking propensity that it is to be found in no other race of animals , which seem to know neither this nor any other species of contracts ' . And a little later he writes : It is by treaty , by barter , and by purchase , that we obtain from one another the greater part of those mutual good offices which we stand in need of ' ( pp. 15 and 17 ) . The difference from Rousseau is here merely that Rousseau speaks of political and Smith of economic contract-making : and in view of the different subjects which the two authors set out to tackle , this is no difference at all . But the parallel goes much further . Like Rousseau , Smith is an egalitarian : nature has not divided class from class , only human arrangements are responsible for such socio-cultural contrasts as we find . The difference of natural talents in different men is , in reality , much less than we are aware of ; and the very different genius which appears to distinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not upon many occasions so much the cause , as the effect of the division of labour . The difference between the most dissimilar characters , between a philosopher and a common street porter , for example , seems to arise not so much from nature , as from habit , custom and education . When they came into the world , and for the first six or eight years of their existence , they were , perhaps , l very much alike . . . About that age , or soon after , they come to be employed in very different occupations . The difference of talents comes then to be taken notice of , and widens by degrees , till at last the vanity of the philosopher is willing to acknowledge scarce any resemblance ' ( pp. 17 , 18 ) . Rousseau habitually expresses such sentiments in far sterner language , but the fundamental attitude is the same . Smith also emphasises that the burden and the pain of laborious effort is the same for all men : Equal quantities of labour , at all times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value to the labourer . In his ordinary state of health , strength and spirits . . . he must always lay down the same portion of his ease , his liberty , and his happiness ' ( p. 35 ) . In a word , a man is a man and neither less nor more .  | In view of this double starting-point ? a tendency on the part of men to exchange goods and services on the one hand , and a basic selfishness and equality of strength on the other ? it is almost unavoidable that Smith should end up with an equilibrium theory , or rather a string of equilibrium theories , for many phenomena are explained in this vein : prices , wages , the population figure &c.; Here we can only look at one sample , and we have chosen for presentation the case of price-formation . How is it that millions of producers , working independently of each other , one not knowing what even his next-door neighbour does , fall into a pattern ; how is it that this initial chaos gives birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How is it , in other words , that individual independence leads to social co-operation ? The miracle of ordering is performed by the price , and the price forms , as a kind of resultant ( in the sense of rational mechanics ) between contradictory tendencies ( the suppliers ' and demanders ' interests ) , on a market which functions like a mechanism . When the quantity of any commodity which is brought to market falls short of the effectual demand , all those who are willing to pay the whole value of the rent , wages , and profit , which must be paid in order to bring it thither , can not be supplied with the quantity which they want . Rather than wanting altogether , some of them will be willing to give more . A competition will immediately begin among them , and the market price will rise . . . When the quantity brought to market exceeds the effectual demand , it can not be all sold to those who are willing to pay the whole value of the rent , wages , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it thither . Some part must be sold to those who are willing to pay less , and the low price which they give for it must reduce the price of the whole . The market price will sink . . . When the quantity brought to market is just sufficient to supply the effectual demand and no more , the market price naturally comes to be either exactly , or as nearly as can be judged of , the same with the natural price . The whole quantity upon hand can be disposed of for this price , and can not be disposed of for more . The competition of the different dealers obliges them all to accept of this price , but does not oblige them to accept of less ' ( pp. 58 , 59 ) . All this is manifestly mechanistically explained . What Smith calls the natural price ' is in substance an equilibrium price . It is the price at which momentary supply and effectual demand ( i.e.  | demand of sufficient price-willingness to cover the costs of production ) meet , or rather form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate metaphor ? the price at which the two sides of the market scales exactly counterbalance each other , at which the cross-beam is in a horizontal position . If there is less in the scale which is labelled supply , it will go up , and the other scale which is labelled demand will go down . If there is more in the scale labelled supply , it will go down , and the other scale which is labelled demand will go up . In either case the cross-beam will not be horizontal , but inclined , to the right or to the left , according to circumstances . But , as on a good balance , there will always be a tendency for the equilibrium position to be reached . If there is , at the moment , undersupply and the price goes up , i.e. if the demanders make a better offer , the supply will increase and the scale labelled supply will be filled more and come down . If , on the other hand , there is , at the moment , oversupply and the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supply will decrease and the scale labelled supply will soon be less full and come up . For the quantity of every commodity brought to market naturally suits itself to the effectual demand . . . The natural price , therefore , is , as it were , the central price , to which the prices of all commodities are continually gravitating . Different accidents may sometimes keep them suspended a good deal above it , and sometimes force them down even somewhat below it . But whatever may be the obstacles which hinder them from settling in this center of repose and continuance , they are constantly tending towards it ' ( pp. 59 , 6o ) . In other words , the economy is a spontaneously self-equilibrating , automatically self-adjusting mechanism . In so far as the economy functions in this way , Smith 's mechanicism is a positive , not a normative one . But a normative element is by no means missing . For the economy will only function in this way , if it is free ? if the sides of the scales can swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any particular commodity ' , Smith explains , can seldom continue long below its natural price . . . Its market price if for some reason too low would soon rise to the natural price . ' But he adds the important proviso : This at least would be the case where there was perfect liberty ' ( p. 64 ; cf. also pp . S 8 and 1oi ) . Here again we are reminded of Rousseau , and , indeed , of the disciples of Rousseau who shouted in the streets of Paris : liberte , liberte .  | However , the shout was not only : liberte , liberte . It was liberte , egalite , fraternite , and the question is whether the normative aspect of the Smithian doctrine contained the egalitarian as well as the libertarian ideal . The answer is in the affirmative ? very much in the affirmative . Smith 's whole analysis of value is based on a distinction between the original ( and good ) state of society and the present ( not so good ) state of society ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the positive valueaccent on the former and the negative on the latter . ' I.n that early and rude state of society which preceeds both the accumulation of stock and the appropriation of land , ' Smith writes ; in other words : when there were as yet no capitalists and landlords , and all were equal , the proportion between the quantities of labour necessary for acquiring different objects seems to be the only circumstance which can afford any rule for exchanging them for one another . . . It is natural that what is usually the produce of two days ' or two hours ' labour , should be worth double of what is usually the produce of one day 's or one hour 's labour . . . In this state of things , the whole produce of labour belongs to the labourer . ' There is no exploitation . But this original state of things , in which the labourer enjoyed the whole produce of his own labours , ' Smith ruefully continues , could not last beyond the first introduction of the appropriation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as stock has accumulated in the hands of particular persons . . . the whole produce of labour does not always belong to the labourer . He must in most cases share it with the owner of the stock which employs him . . . As soon as the land of any country has all become private property , the landlords , like all other men , love to reap where they never sowed , and demand a rent even for its natural produce . . . The labourer must then . . . give up to the landlord a portion of what his labour either collects or produces ' ( pp. 49 ? 51 and 67 ) . Exploitation has come into the world . This is , once again , pure Rousseauian sentiment , his nostalgia for simple , classless society , in a new guise . This is , once again , a theory of the fall . And , once again , a falsification of the social equilibrium is the cause of all the misery : What are the common wages of labour , depends every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters and men , whose interests are by no means the same ... It is not . . . difficult to foresee which of the two parties  | must , upon all ordinary occasions , have the advantage in the dispute , and force the other into a compliance with their terms ' ( p. 68 ) . The scales are no longer even , and paradise is lost . ' Smith was no sentimentalist like Rousseau ; he was a solid and even stolid Scot . But precisely this gives the common doctrine more punch in his hands than it ever had in those of Jean-Jacques . There is , unfortunately , no room in this book for a discussion of the mechanistic element in the successors of Adam Smith ; we can look neither at the pessimistic ( or English ) school of Malthus , Ricardo and the Mills , nor at the optimistic ( or Continental and American ) school of Bastiat , Duhring and Ferrara . One member of the latter group we have studied already ? Henry Charles Carey . Suffice it to say that both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were much closer to each other , and to their master Adam Smith , than in any other . A fresh high-water mark of mechanicism was reached in the eighth decade of the nineteenth century , when Carl Menger published his Grundsat- e der Volkswirthschaftslehre ( 1871 ) and Leon Walras his Elements d'Economie Politique Pure ( first part 1874 ) . Their teachings constituted the neo-classical doctrine which has become a new and abiding orthodoxy . A mechanistic economics clearly demands two ingredients : a study of the individual atoms who enter into the equilibrium system which we call the national economy ; and a study of the relationships between these atoms , a definition of the equilibrium system itself . Menger and his Viennese School elaborated the former ; Walras and his Lausanne School the latter . Between them , they provided a mechanistic description and interpretation of socio-economic life which could hardly be more characteristic . Twelve years after his great work , Menger got involved in a polemic with an economic historian called Schmoller who insisted that induction and description was the proper method of the socio-economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily relied . Underneath this methodological debate , there lurked all the time the irreconcilable contrast between philosophical realism to which Schmoller inclined , and philosophical nominalism upheld by Menger . In his aggressive book , Untersuchungen Uber die Methode der Socialavissenschaften ( 1883 ) , Menger  | uncompromisingly defended the individualistic starting-point . Without it , he claimed , no economic science is possible at all , if the word science is to have any meaning in the context . The chapter headings alone speak a very clear language . The third book , for instance , begins with a discussion of The Analogy between Social Phenomena and Natural Organisms and its Limitations ' , a statement with a sharp sting to its tail . But the core of Menger 's argument is to be found in the last chapter of the first book : On the Reproach of Atomism in Theoretical Economics ' . The phenomena of the " national " economy ' , Menger says here in a crucial passage , are by no means immediate vital manifestations of a nation as such . . . but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation ' ( p. 87 ) . The salient word ' resultant ' , taken from mechanics , is italicised by Menger himself , and he confesses to upholding the thesis that the phenomena of the national economy must , in economic theory , be reduced , in the last analysis , to individual economic efforts , that is to say , to its simplest constitutive elements , and explained in this way ' ( p. 83 ) . This , indeed , is the method which Menger pursues all along . His central theory , i.e. his theory of value , has rightly been described as economic subjectivism , for it is the subject , economic man , from whose individual psychology he derives even the social phenomena of economic life . In order to begin with the simplest case , ' he writes in the Grund dt , e , let us imagine a subject carrying on an isolated economy , living on a rocky island in the sea where there is only one single source of water ' ( p. too ) . This Robinson Crusoe ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is for Menger the key to everything . He will value different quantities of water differently . One measure he needs for drink ; 19 measures for his domestic animals ; 40 measures for cleansing and similar purposes , and 40 measures for comparative luxuries such as his garden and his pets . It is clear that he will value the first bucket-full , on which his survival depends , more highly than the last , which is not vital to him . This is the famous law of decreasing marginal utility ( as Menger 's son-in-law Wieser called it ) . It interests us here because it demonstrates Menger 's radical individualism , atomism and nominalism . The theory of the social economy is for him no more than an extension of the theory of the economic subject in isolation . We see how true this is when we consider Menger 's analysis  | of barter or exchange which , after all , is a social phenomenon ( cf. pp. 16z et seq . ) . He takes us from the rocky island to the depth of the primeval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and B. Both need five horses for purposes of production , and both need five cows for purposes of consumption . Menger now assumes that A has six horses but only one cow , whereas B has six cows but only one horse . Their schedules of valuation will then , in view of the decreasing marginal utility of the animals , the fact that the first is more important than the second , the second more important than the third , and so on , look as follows : In ordinary language this means that the last horse is useless to A , who simply does not need it , just as the last cow is useless to B. If they arrange a swap , namely the last of A 's horses for the last of B 's cows , they both will clearly be better off . Each gives away what , to him , has no value , and acquires what has a value of 40 . In the given circumstances , a further swap will likewise be indicated . If A surrenders his fifth horse and receives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives away what , to him , has the value s o , and receives what has the value 30 , and the same is true of B. The situation will now be as follows : It is obvious immediately that a further swap would be senseless . There would be nothing in it for the parties . All exchanging would therefore come to an end . We have reproduced , in a shortened form , this whole deduction because it allows us to demonstrate-that Menger was not only  | an individualist and an atomist , but also a mechanicist . For what is it that has happened after the second swap ? An equilibrium position has been reached . Or , less mechanically , more mathematically expressed , marginal utilities have been equalised ? which comes to the same . All economic life is , for Menger , characterised and explained by this simplified example . Its essence is a continued tendency towards the equalisation of marginal values and utilities , towards equilibrium . Roughly speaking , Walras can be said to have started where Menger left off . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us imagine , he says , that all intending buyers and all intending sellers crowd into a vast hall , eager to do business . How will they come together ? Somebody , a kind of auctioneer , will call out a price . This prix crie will be no more than a shot in the dark ; and yet it will be the beginning of order , that is to say , equilibration . Assume that the price tentatively suggested is too high . Then some of the intending sellers will have to fear that they will not get rid of their wares . It will be necessary for them to press forward and to offer whatever they have to sell at a lower price . The price-level will come down . Or assume that the price tentatively suggested is too low . Then some of the intending buyers will have to fear that they will not be able to cater for their needs . It will be necessary for them to press forward and to concede a higher price for whatever they wish to acquire . The price-level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more realistic than the first . But whatever happens , the game will go on until the right pricelevel has been found , the price , that is , at which the market will get into an equilibrium position ? more simply expressed , at which offer and demand come into line and the price is exactly right . Walras speaks of a series of tdtonnements ? freely translated , of oscillations ? which lead to this desirable and desired result . The image this term calls up is once again that of a pair of scales . These scales swing up and down for a while until they find their balance , until the cross-beam is in a horizontal position . Once again , we are confronted with pure mechanicism . Every commodity must , and will , in the course of time , find its equilibrium . This equilibrium will be expressible in an equation . A slight complication arises from the fact that equations must be expressed in some numerical index , and that one commodity must be set aside as nurneraire , in-other words , as money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , if we exclude gold ( or whatever is used as currency ) , we are left with n ? i equations . But there are also n ? i unknowns , namely the n ? i prices at which the market , and with it the whole economy , settles down into an abiding pattern of order . Nor have we to worry over the last price , the price of gold . As it expresses the equilibrium price of all other goods , all other goods express the equilibrium price of it . It is just as correct to say that a certain quantity of gold is worth a loaf of bread or a bottle of beer , as it is to say that a loaf of bread or a bottle of beer is worth a certain quantity of gold . All this means that the market is , after sufficient oscillations , in a determined equilibrium . For every system of equations is univocally determined , if the number of equations and the number of unknowns coincide . Both Walras ' theory and Menger 's have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have tremendous difficulties , whether the economists like it or not . What Menger does is to assume that our preference scales are numerical , that if we prefer an apple to a pear it is because an apple gives us more pleasure , pleasure with a higher numerical index ( say 5 ) , than the pear ( which , say , gives us only 4 ) . But this whole formulation is possible only ex post facto . Before we choose , there is no saying what gives us more pleasure . And , indeed , the whole concept of a pleasure unit is profoundly problematical . Is the index-figure for the apple 5 or 50 or Soo ? or any other number ? Some economists have introduced hedonic units ( have spoken of z ut , or utility unit , and i wantab , or desirability unit ) , but such concepts are pure fictions , and they have long ago died a well-deserved death . Under the leadership of Henri Bergson , psychologists have come to recognise that the act of preferring may not be quantifiable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not descend into the murky depths of the economic man 's soul , but remains in the open market and studies his conduct there , a conduct in the clear light of day which everybody can watch for himself . But his doctrine has its own cross . It works well enough in so far as the determination of the price system is concerned . But a full economics is not only concerned with states , such as the state of markets , but also with flows , such as the flow of production , and that is where the weakness of Walrasian mechanicism lies . In order to widen the application of this mechanicism and  | make it , if possible , all-inclusive , the members of the school try to show that most economically relevant actions are , or can be construed as , acts of exchange . Sometimes this endeavour led to notable results . It was shown , for instance , that taxation can be interpreted in this vein . The taxpayer is a buyer who , against an appropriate payment , acquires a valuable commodity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide and to sell it . Such a construct is fairly far from reality , for in reality many extra-economic factors enter into tax policy and tax legislation , and the tax rate is by no means determined , market-fashion , by the demand for , and offer of , the commodity security . Yet the theory is not absurd either . If taxes were based on economic considerations alone , they would have to be fixed as if they were formed on a free market . And as it is arguable that extra-economic motives ought not to enter into the process of taxation , we have here a piece of normative mechanicism which is no worse than any other . Yet when it comes to the interpretation of production as an exchange , the difficulties of this mode of explication become insuperable . What the theory suggests is that production is , properly understood , nothing else than the exchange of certain quantities of the factors of production ( land , labour and capital ) for the finished article which is manufactured from them . If this is so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prices of the factors of production involved ) must be equal to the price of the finished and marketable end product ; and this is indeed what the theory not only assumed , but even proved . Equilibrium implies this equivalence between the two sides of an exchange equation . So far , so good . But a system in equilibrium is a system of interdependence ; it must not only be possible to derive the price of the produce from the prices of the factors , but , inversely , the prices of the factors from the price of the product ; after all , any and every proper equation can be read from both sides . But this derivation of the factor prices from the final prices ? this proof that the former are , as they logically must be , functions of the latter , as the latter are of the former ? has never succeeded , in spite of the fact that a good deal of ingenuity has been spent over it . This is the so-called problem of imputation ' , and its presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something wrong with the Walrasian system .  | Nor is it very difficult to find out what exactly is wrong . Equilibria are states and not processes , but production is a process , not a state . That is to say , it involves time , and as time can not be accommodated in the framework of static formula , there results an artificiality of which the problem of imputation is merely the symptom . To express it differently : the Walrasian equations , being the description of a momentary interdependency , assume that the factor prices are given alongside the prices of the final products , but this is an artificial , nay impossible assumption , because the final products do not , and can not , co-exist with the ( as yet unprocessed ) factors which are their raw materials . To put it in yet another way : production can not be interpreted as a simple exchange , for a gap of time yawns between the two sides of this bargain ' or barter ' ? a gap of time which would demand a far more complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its description than can be provided on the basis , and in the form , of simultaneous equations . When simultaneity is abandoned , however , the mechanistic model goes by the board . ' These difficulties are not spotlighted here in order to criticise the mathematical school of modern economics , which is today firmly in the saddle , or to diminish its prestige . They are in their very nature marginal and not central problems , and leave a good deal of the essential contents of economics as it developed from the Walrasian inspiration untouched . They are brought up here in order to characterise , and not in order to criticise , modern economic theory . Characterisation , however , is helped as much by the discovery of weak as by the discovery of strong points . All that we wanted to reveal was that the mecanique sociale of Leon Walras and his disciples showed and shared the limitations as well as the value of its model , that it was mechanistic for better and for worse . We have spoken only of Walras ' Elements d'Economie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Societe ( 1867 ) , but this book would also have yielded many materials for our analysis , if we had chosen to put it on the dissecting table . Most significant is perhaps its plea for nationalisation of the land . Unlike capital  | and labour , the land ( which is immovable in more senses than one ) does not have a market that would function automatically . Therefore , Walras ( and his kindred contemporary Gossen ) suggested that it should be made more marketable , so as to fit better into a general exchange economy . What was recommended was in substance the replacement of the commodity land by the commodity land-use . If the soil were nationalised and the government sold land-use ( or documents entitling their purchasers to land-use ) on a free market , i.e. to the highest bidder , then the economy as a whole would work even more like a perfect mechanism than it does now . As can be seen , this programme of reform is as much inspired by an underlying and all-pervading philosophical mechanicism as all the rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss a deal , their minds are dominated by one purpose , and one purpose only : to have the best of the bargain . However sophisticated they may be , in the last resort they feel very much like the intending buyer in an Eastern bazaar : he has said 14 piastres ; he means 1z ; he would like to have 1o ; the thing is worth 8 ; I should like to get it for 6 ; I might offer 4 ; well , I 'll try z ; a consideration which , with the appropriate adjustments , is characteristic of the intending seller also . What happens , then , in any such discussion , is that one party will try to pull the price down , while the other will try to push it up : it is all a matter of pushing and puffing , in other words , a mechanical contest between two independent and contrary forces , a tug of war . And it is only when the pushing and pulling is at an end , when the two opposing wills have fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really be concluded . Here , in this simple act , we have at once the deepest root and the highest justification of the mechanistic conception of social life . All the elements of the theory are present : there is , to begin with , no association whatsoever ; there are only the individuals concerned ; these individuals are entirely selfish ; the conditions of co-operation are not pre-existent but consequent to their encounter ; they emerge only from their contest after an equilibrium position has been reached ; and , ultimately , the balance of forces which has emerged leads to , and , as it were , materialises itself in , a contract . Generalise this pattern , and you have something like Rousseau 's theory of the social bond . As can be seen , there appears to be a substantial coincidence 185 between the realities of the market and the assumptions of the theory . But the similarity goes in fact much further than might be assumed at first sight . What determines the outcome of a price struggle , is not , as a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the contenders ' tongues , though , within limits , even negotiating skill may play a part : no , basically it is what market researchers call the statistical position of the commodity concerned , which decides the outcome . It all depends on the quantities involved : on the one hand , the quantity of the offer ; on the other hand , the quantity of the demand . If the offer exceeds the demand , the seller is the weaker partner and the struggle goes against him ; if the demand exceeds the offer , the seller is the stronger partner and the struggle goes against the buyer . If we exclude accidental factors , the emerging equilibrium position will indicate , and the ultimately-concluded contract will incorporate , a price which will be the true resultant of the contending forces . Everything happens quasi-mechanically ; and everything that happens is expressible in perfectly determinate equations . The momentary supply is clearly a quantity , a simple figure ; and the demand , although in the last analysis coming from the dark recesses of the consumer 's mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate on the market ? quantify itself in a certain determinate price-willingness which will be no less a simple figure than the available supply . Hence everything here invites mechanistic construction and mathematical description ; and we can not but conclude that , on their home pitch , the economists are fully within their rights when they turn to physics for their formulge and for their tools . The realism of this mechanistic and mathematical marketanalysis has been arraigned by saying that it is not economic quantity but power politics which is really decisive on many markets , such as , for instance , the labour market : that the market mechanism is never allowed to work . But an investigation of what goes on shows soon enough that the observation which is meant to controvert the theory is apt to confirm it . Power , of course , plays its part , but it is power which asserts itself through the market mechanism , not against it . The trade unions , it is said , falsify the play of the economic forces . Lujo Brentano 's theory of trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have trade  | unions arisen in the first place ? Because , Brentano answers , the labour market of early capitalism was a market in permanent disequilibrium . When an individual capitalist who controls the means of production ( a full money bag ) meets an individual workman who has nothing to sell but his labour power ( an empty stomach ) , no fair bargain can be struck : the offer of labour will be so urgent as to preclude any successful bargaining . In order to make up for this inherent weakness on the part of the seller , Brentano tells us ? and he is right ? trade unionism was invented . Labour united is not so weak , not so much under a crippling handicap , as labour dispersed . Call a trade union a monopoly , if you like : it is a monopoly formed in reply to another monopoly : it is essentially a move to ensure that the scales are even . Mechanicism is , if anything , strengthened by the phenomenon of trade union organisation . Such power struggle as there is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is normally carried on through attempts to influence the statistical position of the commodity in question . This was shown by Friedrich von Wieser in his sociological writings.I Indeed , even when industrial peace breaks down , the situation is not radically transformed . For what is it that happens when the workers come out on strike ? Soberly considered , what happens is that the offer of labour is , for the time being , reduced to nil . And what is it that happens when the employers enforce a lock-out ? What happens is that the demand for labour is , for the time being , reduced to nil . The contest is greatly intensified , but not essentially changed , and the market equations must be reformulated , but they need not be abandoned . Mechanicism remains realistic : it can accommodate even the abnormal conditions of industrial war . It appears , from what has gone before , that the mechanistic conception of human relationships has its firm ground in life , just as the organistic conception has , as we have shown in chapter VII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , as the more enthusiastic supporters of it claim , universal , but merely partial , indeed , strictly limited . Economists are inclined to assume that a market is always a market , and that what goes on on it , is at all times and places the same . But this is not so . Under modern ( capitalistic ) conditions , there is in fact the tug of war between  | buyer and seller which allows us to liken the formation of the price to the establishment of a mechanical equilibrium ; but in societies of the community type everything is different . The price is not an emergent point of order there , but a pre-existent one , indeed , part and parcel of an abiding pattern which individual action can hardly modify , let alone create . This precisely made it possible for the medieval thinkers to speak about the just price : the price was thought to be and in fact was ! ? given when the contracting parties appeared on the market ; it was not a mere starting point of negotiations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties were expected , nay constrained , to accept it and to accommodate themselves to it . Ontologically , it was prior to the bargain , not posterior to it , as it is in modern conditions . It had reality ' in the sense of philosophical realism , just as the social order as a whole had ; it was not a fleeting compromise left to the contractants , but part and parcel of objective customary law . Hence the mechanistic theory ought to be restricted to **25;1492;TOOLONG societies , just as the organistic theory ought to be confined to closely-knit communities , the clan , the tribe , the village , the medieval town . The former fits modernity , the latter antiquity , and this is the reason why the former has appealed to the economists , the latter to anthropological research . ' We have not , however , said enough when we have pointed out that the mechanistic model is applicable only to some societies and not to all , for it is not applicable to the whole of any society , ancient or modern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only some aspects even of the capitalist order . It is certainly sound with regard to the market , but the market is after all no more than a partial phenomenon inside the total phenomenon which we call society . A brief consideration will show that this is so , and why . The encounter of the two sides to a prospective bargain will only lead to a positive and pacific arrangement , if they keep in their dealings with each other within the bounds of ordinance . Should discussion lead to recrimination , recrimination to annoyance , and annoyance to blows , what would emerge would not be a focus of order , but a hotbed of disorder , and this is even more true of collective than of individual bargaining . In other words , to use current sociological jargon , the parties must keep to the definition  | of the situation . But who defines the situation for them ? Who establishes the bounds of ordinance , the framework of order , within which alone contract-making can come from a contest of contrary interests ? It is society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely a restricted area , a contained sector . This wider social order must in fact pre-exist , and must of necessity he thought to pre-exist , the economic order or equilibrium system . Hence the equilibrium theory , however much it may do for us when it comes to the analysis of economic life , can not provide us with an inclusive sociology , a sociology of the inclusive society . And here we see indeed the prime weakness ? the far-reaching lack of realism ? of sociological mechanicism which has been pointed out by practically all its critics . The concept of contract is a concept of law ; there must be a framework of legality before contract-making in the proper sense of the word can start , for what should induce the parties to honour their engagements before the emergence of a spirit of law-abidingness ? Rousseauism presupposes that which it sets out to explain . It is defeated , not only by observation , but even by simple logic . It is , if anything , inferior to organicism . It is , however , but fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic , but even in the legal sector of society , inside that very system of social control which is an absolutely indispensable precondition of constructive-cooperative contract-making . When a man has committed a crime and is brought before the judge , the truth about the matter is elicited , not by direct investigation , but in an indirect way , by pitting accusation and defence against each other . It is regarded as perfectly in order that the guilty man should plead not guilty ' ; indeed , prosecutor and defence are allowed many liberties , the liberty to use subterfuges , equivocations and even tricks : in a word , techniques reminiscent of war , or at the very least of that preparation and continuation of war which we are wont to call diplomacy . We have a battle of wits in which the parties are again expected to fight each other to a standstill , and which ? we assume ? will make it possible for him who holds the scales to decide on which side there is the heavier weight . This is yet another feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support . But though we admit that its existence and importance should not be overlooked , it does not oblige us to  | take back the stricture on the equilibrium concept which we formulated at the end of the foregoing paragraph . For , once again , the situation within which the parties act is socially defined , in fact severely so . Without the concept of contempt of court ' and the stern measures enforced to avoid and avenge it , an orderly process of law would be as little possible as an orderly functioning of the market without general pacification and policing . Nor is there , at this point , much contrast between modern and earlier societies . Nowadays the authority of the courts is so well established that some of the cumbersome formalism of primitive times has become unnecessary , for instance the obligatory use of set and solemn language , with a few tonguetwisters thrown in , which , on a cruder level , helped to keep the temper of the parties down . But this is , after all , a purely technical difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be no due process of law without efficient safeguards against the outbreak of violence before the face of the law personified , the judge . We should say , then , that sociological mechanicism can draw more support from the study of facts in society than from that of the facts of society . But though we can hardly imagine that a society as a whole should have arisen from the clash and equilibration of individual forces , there were times when these forces tended to become free , and when society was , in consequence , on the way towards a state in which it was , comparatively speaking , individualistic and atomistic , i.e. more built on the pattern of a mechanical equilibrium than on that of an integrated organism . At such junctures , mechanistic theories tended to appear , and that for the very good reason that they were , again comparatively speaking , realistic . Of course , though comparatively realistic , they were also , as a rule , largely ideological , that is to say , they not only reflected the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of individuals than a tautly coherent body , but also the desire to make society into a loose collection of individuals , to end an earlier taut coherence . In theory , we can cleanly divide truth and ideology ; in practice , they all too often appear intermixed in the manner of milk and tea . An early period at which , as some would say , the fibres of the body social relaxed , or , as others would put it , the individual secured a good measure of his due personal independence , is  | marked by the appearance of the philosopher Epicurus , who was born in 341 and died at Athens around 270 B.C. Already in the days of Plato ( 427 ? 347 ) the old , closely integrated social constitution of the city began to show signs of severe strain , indeed , of incipient dissolution . At once a philosophical movement sprang up to reflect , and to promote , this shift in the social situation . Still echoing the judgement of the guardians of order and tradition , we are wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophists . For a very good reason , which will emerge presently , we can also describe them as the Greek Enlightenment . Epicurus , their main disciple , taught that the end of human society was the promotion of individual interests ; that it was created by the consent of each of its members ; and that it was , in essence , a pattern of reciprocity , not a body endowed with an ontological reality of its own . Justice is not something that has a value of its own , ' Epicurus is reported by Diogenes Laertius to have taught . It exists exclusively in mutual contracts and comes into being wherever there is a reciprocal engagement not to inflict injury , and not to receive This is sociological nominalism ; and it is a nominalism in contact , if not with the state of contemporary society , then at least with a tendency in it . Nor is the mechanistic prop to the theory missing . In his philosophy of nature , Epicurus strongly upheld the atomistic position , and whatever prestige he managed to give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics . But the great , the , so to speak , classical period of mechanicism was the long drawn-out age which began with such writers as Marsilius of Padua ( ca. 1270 ? 1343 ) and ended with such writers as Immanuel Kant ( 1724-18o4 ) - or , to speak of what matters more in the present context , where we are concerned with the relative truth-content of this kind of doctrine , the age which stretched from the establishment of the embryonic form of bourgeois society in the medieval city to its momentary realisation , on a national scale , in the great French Revolution . In discussing this factual development and its intellectual concomitants , it is necessary to make a distinction between bourgeois society and capitalism . At best we could speak , as some have done , of classical capitalism , meaning thereby its form before the onset of that tendency towards closer integration , which we can observe , above  | all , since ca. 1875 . By bourgeois society or classical capitalism we mean a pattern under which the carrier of social , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a master manufacturer , the craftsman or , at most , small scale entrepreneur in industry , a figure whose parallel in agriculture is the peasant or , in certain countries , the farmer . These types were independent producers with no bosses above and few , if any , minions below them , secure in their independence by virtue of the control of their means of production , tools in the one case , land in the other , and housing in both . Not that society ever consisted only of peasants and artisans , only of free and equal men , but the approach of social development to that pattern was increasingly close , and it not only engendered an individualistic , atomistic , mechanistic and contractual social philosophy , with its climax in the ideas and ideologies of Enlightenment , but also provided , within certain limits , a transitory justification for it . The medieval city , embedded as it was in a wider world of which hierarchy was the key-note , can hardly be described as an abode of human equality . A goldsmith was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better man than a coppersmith . Yet these invidious distinctions were washed in over the town walls from the outside rather than native to the town itself . Certain basic rights were common to all citizens ; and where class contrasts developed , such as those between patriciate and proletariat , they soon evoked class struggles which , in the end , secured substantial democratisation . Both the advent of the mendicant orders and the outbreak of the Reformation with its idea of a universal , and not a privileged , priesthood , were part and parcel of a continuing effort towards an applanation of the social structure . Clearly , the townsmen could see , in the not too distant future , a society of equals among equals which would not , like the declining feudal order beyond the walls , be a hierarchy with emperor , pope or king as head , knights as arms and serfs as feet , but an assemblage of neighbours , one as strong or as weak as the next , whose forces would counterbalance each other ? a society reminiscent of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than of a pyramid , with the apex far removed from ? and high above ? the base . When the town walls were torn down and the nation became the inclusive framework of social life , this image of the future of  | society became , if anything , even clearer . True , the burghers and peasants were now only the third estate , over whom there lay , incubus-like , the privileged strata of nobility and clergy , but just for this reason the conclusion seemed inescapable that all that was needed in order to make society an association of free and equal men was the removal of these minority groups . Wealth was not thought to present a major problem . There were , of course , wealthy people , just as there were large-scale factories , but both appeared , not unnaturally , as outgrowths and appendages of the ancien regime and would disappear with it . Why were some people rich , for instance the share-holders of the Hudson Bay Company ? Because the king had given them an exclusive privilege . Why were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Because they manufactured cannons for the king . The abolition of legal prerogatives and the abandonment of war , the sport of kings ' , would , it was felt , do away with all that prevented the social mechanism from working properly and from producing that equilibrium of individual forces which was natural ' and would for ever establish harmony among men and a happiness undreamt of before . It was to the implementation of this anticipated pattern of social life that the men of the French Revolution devoted themselves , and in so far as they succeeded , they not only realised a social dream , but at the same time also validated a social theory , that mechanicism which had had its most impressive spokesman in Jean-Jacques Rousseau . The detail does not belong to this place , but it will be useful to look , however briefly , at one revolutionary enactment which illustrates our point in the most convincing manner ? the so-called Loi Le Chapelier of June 14-17 , 1791 . What this act did , especially in its salient article 4 , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's associations . If , against the principles of liberty and of the Constitution , the citizens belonging to the same occupations , arts and crafts should take counsel with each other and enter into agreements with the aim of collectively refusing , or of not granting otherwise than for a certain price , the services of their industry or of their labour , the aforesaid deliberations and conventions , whether or not confirmed by oaths , shall be regarded as unconstitutional , attacks on liberty and the Declaration of the Rights of Man , and null and void . ' This ban was meant , as we had  | better repeat , not only to inhibit the development of what we now call trade unions , but also to nip in the bud all possible conventicles and conspirations on the part of factory owners . That this was so is shown by a decree of Germinal 26-29 , year II : Financial companies are and remain suppressed . All bankers , traders and other persons are forbidden to form establishments of this kind , whatever their pretended purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more peremptory than that . Our concern here is not so much with the enactment as such , or its content , as with the rationale of it , its ulterior purpose . An expert has summed up in the following words the key thought of the Constituent Assembly ' in passing this law : As the Constitution has recognised all rights as equal , the freedom of contracts between workman and employer has become a reality . A monopoly does not exist ; the two parties are on the same level so far as the free discussion of the conditions of employment is concerned . Having need of each other . . . they have every interest to come to a soundly based agreement . Competition affects the employer as much as it does the workman , and the equilibrium could be broken only by an alliance of one of the contracting parties with those like him ' ? which it was precisely the purpose of the law to prevent . Hence , the whole piece of law-making we are studying here was an attempt to make certain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconnected individuals striving to pit their strength against each other and to balance their forces . This is further confirmed ' , we are told a little later , by the parliamentary reports of the time , and the intervention of one deputy , Roederer , is noteworthy . He denounces corporate organisations , not only as a political danger which would divide the citizens and set them against each other , but above all as a factor making for economic disequilibrium . . . Of course , things did not work out as the Rousseauians inside  | and outside the Constituent Assembly thought they would . The concentration of capital is not hampered in any way by this law ' , writes our historian , but ... the coalition of workers is forbidden , and for this reason the disequilibrium which the Constituent Assembly wished to avoid , made its appearance . " True enough : but this is no more than the wisdom of hindsight . Nor did the challenge of the concentration of capital remain unanswered by the sons of the Revolution when it raised its head : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon , was meant to dissolve , at a man 's death , the masses of property which he had built up during his life . In any case , whether later generations saw the equilibrium theory confirmed or disproved by subsequent developments , the fact remains that around the year 1789 French society approached very closely to a state of affairs under which it was , to say the least , not absurd to see it as essentially an association of free and equal men , a system of individual forces which mutuality held together much in the way in which the stars of the high heavens are kept in harmony ? in spite of all their independence ? by the attractions and repulsions of which they are the source . In France , this condition ? essentially the moment of transition between the inequalities of the feudal system and those of full capitalism ? did not last very long ; indeed , one could almost speak of a kind of historical razor 's edge . But there was another political formation that showed the same characteristics a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England colonies which we know as the kernel of the United States of America . The social contrasts of feudalism were largely unknown in Massachusetts and Connecticut ; nor did the social contrasts of capitalism unfold quite so rapidly there as in Europe . There was a special reason for this : the open frontier to the west , the availability of free land . Locke had already emphasised the importance of this factor.2 Whoever was dependent could gain independence by moving inland and becoming a settler : no pool of hopelessness could collect in the cities by the Atlantic shore . Furthermore , the men who made Massachusetts and Connecticut were Puritans , and the Puritans sought rather than fled solitude . Hence a kind of society developed which fitted in well enough with the  | Rousseauian ideal : dispersed homesteads , not hovels on top of each other ; few common concerns , and those arranged , as they arose , by amicable agreement among the neighbours ; everybody as rich or as poor as his industry made him ; he who dug more ground , reaping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with the American social and political constitution , for if ever a commonwealth was founded by a covenant , it was that which sprang from the covenant of the Pilgrim Fathers on board the Mayflower . It is difficult to believe that Rousseau , scion of Calvinist Geneva , did not know of , and think of , the Calvinists of the New World , when he wrote Du Contrat Social.l Of course , here , too , the reign of liberty and equality did not last very long . John Taylor 's Inquiry into the Principles and Policy of the Government of the United States , published in 1814 , was its obituary . But what is so interesting is that social thought anticipated , rather than followed , the coming demise of the social order in equilibrium . We have said that the use of organismic language by the Physiocrats has its significance , and we begin to see that significance here . Even while the liberation of man was still in prospect and progress , the feeling gained ground that a society of full freedom would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cement than the equilibration of individual forces , if it was to last . Rousseau is even more of a straw in the wind here than Quesnay . In De l'Economie Politique and Du Contrat Social he uses the body metaphor freely , even though he calls it at once a common and in many ways little-exact comparison ' ( cf. I , p. 389 , and II , pp. 229 , 230 ) . And in La Nouvelle Heloise he expresses himself as follows : It is a great error , both in the domestic economy and in the civil , to wish to combat one vice with the help of another , or to form a kind of equilibrium between them : as if that which undermines the foundations of order could ever serve to establish them . ' This does not prevent him from writing later on in the same book : One can triumph over the passions only by pitting them against each other ' ( cf. IV , pp. 256 , 257 and 310 ) . The latter is really the stronger sentiment in Rousseau ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional appearance of passages of organismic import heralds that mighty return of organicism which we can observe after 1815.  | As we have seen in chapter VII , there is , around the middle of the century , a renewal of confidence in the capitalist order , and with it , in individualism and liberalism . This , in turn , leads to a reversal of intellectual trends : mechanicism had been in the shadows for a while , now it emerges again into the light . The ripest fruit of this recovery of its prestige is the works of the great economists which appeared right at the end of this new nominalistic period which , as has been pointed out , breaks off with the onset of the Great Depression . It is as if the convictions and cogitations of thirty or forty years tried to incarnate themselves in truly classical statements worthy of their importance . But the new mechanicism is not quite like the old : it is above all much narrower . In view of the vast class contrast and conflict that had sprung up between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of a total social equilibrium such as Adam Smith and Rousseau had envisaged . There could only be talk of an equilibrium of economic forces ? which meant that society was regarded as a mechanism for the maximisation of material production rather than for the maximisation of human harmony . Yet , within these closer confines , the theory was realistic enough . When Menger and Walras laid down their pens , in 1871 and i 874 respectively , the economy had reached its nearest , neverto-be-beaten approach to quasi-automatic functioning . From then onward , the forces of conscious control were again on the attack , though they did not gain much ground until the great wars of the present century . In the ' seventies there were as yet no high tariff walls ; the gold standard had made all countries into one currency area ; trade unionism was largely restricted to the skilled workers ; the so-called new unionism ' which was to organise the far more important unskilled , was only just appearing over the horizon . In a word , there was , if no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this it was which gave strength to an economic , and , by implication , social theory which insisted that social facts and institutions are merely resultants of independent forces , not aspects of a pre-existing integrated pattern . ' If the total interpretation of the history of social thought which is upheld in this book is correct , we must expect that the second  | generation of neo-classical economists ( who lived and worked during the Great Depression ) should show some inclination at any rate towards organismic conceptions . And this is indeed the case . We have already referred to this side of Alfred Marshall , and with his name we must couple here that of John Bates Clark , another significant figure . ' The shift from more mechanistic to more biological conceptions was easily accomplished , for Walras had put the idea of functional interdependence into the centre of economic theory , and this idea can be interpreted both in a mechanistic-mathematical and in a biotic-physiological sense . A careful analysis of some finesse would be needed in order to show how ( and to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least its undertones and overtones . It can not be undertaken here . But there are passages in which the matter becomes altogether manifest . One occurs at the beginning of book V of Marshall 's Principles of Economics ( ed. 1952 , p. 269 ) . Giving a preview of his argument , Marshall writes : As we reach the higher stages of our work , we shall need ever more and more to think of economic forces as resembling those which make a young man grow in strength , till he reaches his prime ; after which he gradually becomes stiff and inactive , till at last he sinks to make room for other and more vigorous life . But to prepare the way for this advanced study we want first to look at a simpler balancing of forces which corresponds rather to the mechanical equilibrium of a stone hanging by an elastic string , or of a number of balls resting against one another in a basin . ' 2 What the great economist implies is that the mechanistic model is only a first and crude approximation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them and makes a far fuller and finer understanding of them possible . After the turn of the century ? i.e. after the spasm of the Great Depression had passed and the economic mechanism was again working smoothly ? the pendulum swings once again towards a predominance of pure mechanicism , both inside economics and outside it , in the social sciences at large . The age of Vilfredo Pareto arrives . Vainly would one look in his Manuale di Economca  | Politica ( 1906 ) for those echoes of organicism which are not infrequently found in Marshall 's Principles of Economics ; what his Trattato di Sociologia Generale is like , we have seen . Pareto outdoes even Menger and Walras ; Menger because he ejects from his system the psychological elements whose measurability must be doubtful , Walras because he discards the traces of normative thinking which still abound in the works of the master . From the death of Marshall ( in 1924 ) onward , economics becomes mathematical out-and-out ; and the Pareto spirit spills over into sociology as well and fills such influential thinkers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growing concern with planning brought neither a turning-away from mechanicism nor a turning towards more holistic modes of thought , although both movements might have been expected , and the question arises why the model of physics has remained so firmly in command , in spite of the radical change in the objective situation . The answer is not difficult to give . The twentieth century is pre-eminently the period of theoretical and applied physics which has gone from strength to strength , outdistancing in prestige all the other sciences without exception . Pareto and his disciples , great and small , liked the mantle of the physicist , as Spencer , in his day , had , for the very same reason , fancied himself in that of the biologist . Once again we see that the parallel holds . But not entirely , for the lure of physics is far more potent than that of biology ever was , or ever can be . Bergson has told us why . Man , physically very ill-equipped for the struggle of survival , is forced , from the first moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well-nigh his only effective weapon . Therefore his mind is directed outwards , towards that objective world within which the human race has to maintain and assert itself , and in the process it acquires a certain bent which it is difficult to get rid of later on . Our mentality is such that we feel most at home in what is measurable or at least quantifiable , and we have a tendency to range the branches of learning in accordance with this criterion . The most mathematical are the best , the least mathematical the worst . The man in the street admires machine-building because all is calculation there ; he feels sorry for medicine because so much in it depends on guess-work . For the philosophic mind , this primitive  | evaluation of the comparative status of the sciences is , of course , utterly unacceptable ; but how many sociologists or economists are philosophically minded ? Let us face it : most of them would rather have a quasi-mathematical doctrine than a true one . This , of course , is treason ? treason , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science , for the true scientific spirit demands that the complexity of the factual world be boldly confronted , and not conjured away by substituting for it a simplified and fictitious model . But it is with the service of Science as it is with the labourers in the Lord 's vineyard : many are called , but few are chosen .  | agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee , calico or tobacco , or some other such low concern , to be taken up for a little temporary interest , and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties . . . It is a partnership in all science ; a partnership in all art ; a partnership in every virtue , and in all perfection . As the ends of such a partnership can not be obtained in many generations , it becomes a partnership not only between those who are living , but between those who are living , those who are dead , and those who are to be born . Each contract of each particular state is but a clause in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the higher natures , connecting the visible and invisible world , according to a fixed compact sanctioned by the inviolable oath which holds all physical and all moral natures , each in their appointed place ' ( Works , ed . Rivington , 1826 seq. , V , pp. 183 , 184 ) . The very bombast of this passage is characteristic , for it is meant to hide an unsettled mind ? a mind whose unsettlement it merely helps to reveal . What is it that Burke is telling us ? That society is indeed a contract ' , but is certainly not one ; that it is indeed a human artefact , but belongs essentially to the order of nature . A comparison of other pages brings the brokenness of Burke 's thought even more clearly into prominence . Speaking with the voice of the eighteenth century , he writes : The rights of men and governments are their advantages ; and these are often in balances of good ; in compromises sometimes between good and evil , and sometimes between evil and evil . Political reason is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another context he hotly condemns what he has just asserted , maintaining that in politics the most fallacious of all things is geometrical demonstration ' ( pp. 126 and 313 ) . There is , then , confusion ? but it is not the useless and dangerous confusion of the barren mind ; it is much rather the fertile and promising confusion of the open intellect , the confusion which precedes creation . Unable to see society either in mechanistic or in organistic terms , Burke slowly comes to realise that it is in essence cultural , that is to say , not the product of natural forces , be they inanimate or animate , but an achievement of human effort ? something which man has added on to the lower realities . Political arrangement , as it is a work for social ends , is to be only wrought by social means ' , he says . There mind must conspire with mind . Time is required to produce that union of  | minds which alone can produce all the good we aim at ' ( p. 305 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first sight . For what they indicate is that Burke takes the phenomenon of sociality out of the natural setting in which both mechanicists and organicists had set and seen it , and transfers it to the realm of history , a truly human matrix . It is in this new spirit that Burke , in An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs , defines society as the ancient order into which we are born ' ( VI , p. 207 ) . But Burke came to his insights in an entirely unconscious way , almost , one might say , by groping in the dark . The traditional dichotomy in social philosophy could hardly be resolved in this way ; what was needed was a conscious effort to overcome it , and for that the world had to wait the better part of another hundred years . A book now nearly forgotten ? Alfred Fouillee 's La Science Sociale Contemporaine , first published in 1880 ? gave a mighty impetus in this direction . Sociologists ought to remember it with more affection than they do . Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and went a long way with , such leading organicists as Spencer and Espinas . He can even say : We have the right to include societies in what the naturalists call the organic realm , in contradistinction to the inorganic realm . ' But on the very same page on which this passage appears , there is a footnote which tells another story : ' M. Espinas , in his very remarkable book on Societes Animales , has asserted too complete a coincidence between society and the animal properly so called . This has led him to imagine the existence of a " social consciousness " more or less analogous to the individual awareness which the animal has of its organism . . . Such a social consciousness would be incompatible with the particular consciousness which each member of society has of himself . It is precisely the diffusion of individual consciousness among all the parts of society ? united , as we may add , to the idea of , and to the desire for , social integration ? which , according to me , characterises societies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 158 , 15 9 ) . Fouillee , as we can see , goes with Espinas , but only part of the way ; he stops where he ought to stop , where reason becomes unreason . It is admirable how clearly Fouillee focussed the problem before him . Two fundamental conceptions of society , ' he says , divide , to this day , the spirits between them . These two conceptions . . .  | are the theory of social organism and the theory of social contract . Although they appear at first contradictory , a detailed analysis of them both shows that they are equally true and consequently reconcilable . The one seems to derive all in society from the fatal laws of objective life and nature , the other from the free play of thought and men 's subjective life ; the one speaks above all of slow development in subordination to the fixities of tradition , the other seems to hope for the creation of a new world through freedom . The one places its trust in the almost unconscious conduct of which the body social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of ideas and of the will . ' The two points of view are commonly presented as contradictory , and we are invariably invited to embrace the one and reject the other . But , Fouillee says , in our opinion rightly , in their positive foundations , the two theories are both correct ; the one is in itself as true as the other . Their errors arise merely from false deductions and false interpretations ; and consequently the full truth is the scientific synthesis of these two theories ' ( pp. 392 , 393 ) . This merging of the streams is what Fouillee hopes to bring about , and the sentences which we have quoted indicate already how he proposes to achieve his aim . Organicism , he explains , thinks in terms of a subconscious urge to associate , contractualism in terms of association through fully conscious action ; but it is in both cases man who acts , and in man the subconscious and the conscious are not two worlds apart ; on the contrary , they form a continuum . The conscious will is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tends , spontaneously , to express and perfect itself in conscious conduct . Bluntschli would find the origin of the state in a natural sociability , Rousseau in artificial contracting , but they do not see ' , either of them , that sociability , being the tendency to associate , resolves itself into a tendency to conclude contracts ' ( p. 8 ) . If there is any society at all which is prefigured and preformed by nature , and which would consequently confirm the submissions of organicism , it is surely that of male and female , husband and wife . But , Fouillee asks , is the marriage partnership not at the same time also the archetype of a conscious union , a society which comes into being through a contract ? And is it not the same with the children ? Originally , they remain with the parents because they must , because nature bids them so , but after a while  | they remain out of their own free will , because it suits them , and there is no assignable moment when the one condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade into each other like the colours of the spectrum . There is certainly transition , indeed , radical change , but no radical break . Or , to speak even more correctly , transition and change occur only in our conceptual interpretation of the family , not in the family itself . In life , the marriage contract matures into organic union , and the organic union of parents and children weakens into a utilitarian association by entirely imperceptible steps : there is continuity , and not that discontinuity which the clamour of the philosophical parties and partisans with their warring definitions would suggest . Developing his theme , Fouillee tries to establish two correlated points : firstly , that an organism , though essentially a unity , is also a multiplicity ; and secondly , that a contractual whole , though essentially a multiplicity , is also a unity , and not necessarily a precarious one . What is , according to all the physiologists , the first and the most essential feature of a living body ? It is the cooperation of dissimilar parts for the preservation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful , can be called , in the style of philosophical realism , harmony , or , if we so prefer it , in the style of philosophical nominalism , equilibrium of forces : in life this comes very much to the same thing . It would be wrong to forget the independence of the cells over their interdependence in the organism : Nothing is so egoistical at the outset as the animalcula of which an animal is composed ; each one draws everything to himself , and it is the equilibrium of these egoisms which constitutes life . On seeing the marvel of the end result , one would be inclined to say , no doubt , that each cell has worked for the others , yet it has worked only for itself ; one would be inclined to say that it has set before itself as its end the welfare of the whole , and yet it has had no other end but its own preservation which simply happens to be mechanically tied in with that of the other cells . " We do not know what life as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in the form in which we encounter it , it is made up of several lives leading in the end to a state of equilibrium ' ( pp. 78 , 89 , 871 ) . While an organism is in this way ? against the popular idea of it ? a composite thing , a contract creates ? again in contradiction  | to common conceptions ? a unitary formation . It is absurd to think of a nation as an association one can contract out of , or which one needs to contract into ; but that does not mean that a nation can not be interpreted as a network of tacit agreements and arrangements . He who says contract , ' Fouillee writes in a lapidary sentence , says solidarity ' . The concept of contrat social ' , he also writes , does not logically imply . . . the break-up of the state : the French nation is constituted by all the Frenchmen together with the totality of the general and particular contracts which bind them together . And this bond is the most solid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any single individual will , but on forty millions of wills which have obligations towards each other and even towards the generations whose inheritance they accept . . . Society is , consequently , under this system , not a simple nominal collection of individuals . . . It is , on the contrary , an organism of a kind . . . Contracting has precisely the aim of making that organism more perfect and more solid ' ( pp. 16 , 14 , 15 , 29 ) . What Fouillee does in these passages can perhaps be summed up by saying that he virtually abandons the old conceptions and replaces them by the new key-concept of solidarity which can be regarded as expressive both of the essence of organic and of that of contractual integration . But though this is the upshot of his analysis , he chooses to use the old conceptions , or at any rate the old terms , for the formulation of his new definition of sociality . He calls society a contractual organism ' ( p. iii and often ) . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this phrase a contradiction in terms ; but , more profoundly considered , we have in it an altogether realistic description of the basic social fact . Society is both a multiplicity and a unity , and so contractual organism ' is entirely apt . Fouillee also calls it an organism which exists because it has been mentally conceived and willed ' ( p. 1 t 5 ) ? conceived and willed like a contract , and constituted as a unity like an organism . Fouillee comes close here to a lawyer 's concept which has great sociological significance , the concept of the legal personality . The state is in law a personality : it can act as such , sue and be sued , and so on . But it is not a personality outside the law : legal fiction apart , it is a will of wills , not a will of its own ? and in this way it both is , and is not , an independent entity . Fouillee claims that his conscious and considered contradiction  | in terms closes for ever the protracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of contractual organism , nominalism and realism coincide : human society is something man designs , and it is also an objective reality . . . Political striving , in a society of beings endowed with reason and volition , has to be a work of art in order to be a work of nature , and the contractual organism is precisely the reconciliation of these two things ' ( pp. 121 , izz ) . With the spurious contrast between nominalism and realism , there also disappears the old conflict between causalism and finalism , so far at any rate as the social sciences are concerned . Men strive to realise a vision of society which they have set before themselves : in so far as they strive to realise it , it is their end ( in the sense of finalism ) ; in so far as they set it before themselves , they are its cause ( in the sense of causalism ) ; for , and here Fouillee opens up an avenue along which cultural sociology has ever to advance , in the sphere of humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality , of a conscious cause . It was one of Fouillee 's convictions that society is becoming more and more contractual ( though this means for him that it is also becoming more and more coherent , i.e. organical ) , and this idea links him with the thinker whom we have to consider next ? Ferdinand Tonnies , whose famous Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft first appeared seven years after Fouillee 's book , in 1887 . Tonnies is nearer to the central position of a specifically cultural sociology than even Fouillee had been , because he sees the basis of all social life in a will to associate , that is to say , not in a natural fact or law , but in an exclusively human attribute . The very first words of his book bear witness to this belief : Human wills stand in manifold relations to one another . ' It is this fact which matters to the sociologist : it is this fact which must provide the key to the understanding of all social phenomena . When we speak of willing , we do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who is in the throes of thirst sees a glass of water , he wants it , and we say that his will is directed towards it ; if a man who is engaged in trade sees the chance of a profit , he also wants it , and we say again that his will is directed towards it . But the first kind of will is essentially different from the second . The first is entirely natural . It is in the last analysis the inborn craving to survive , and therefore we can also speak of an existential will here . The second is not so much natural as rational .  | There is no dark urge at the bottom of it , but rather a cool and clear calculation , a cunning balancing of chances . Perhaps we can best throw the contrast between the two types into high relief , if we raise the question : why does the man concerned display this appetition , why does he will what he wills ? In the case of the thirsty man and the glass of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless it is an answer to say that there is an elementary striving to be , and that this desire for drink is a manifestation of it . We are immediately up against mystery : the mystery of life , the mystery of existence . But when we consider the business man and his prospective profit , when we ask him why he buys , at this time , the shares or the wares he is buying , we shall get very full reasons : there is no mystery at all ; on the contrary , there is nothing but rationality . The motive is as assignable as it is unassignable in the other case . From these two forms of willing , Tunnies tells us , spring two forms of society : Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft , community and association . ) When a man marries , he follows as a rule what we fondly call the voice of the heart : love , as an experience , is in the last analysis inexplicable , and so is sympathy . If calculation is brought in , if the man wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something is wrong here , that the relationship is spoilt . Community repels and recoils from the monetary motive , and the marriage bond is , or rather ought to be , a communal bond , not merely an associational bond . But when a man looks for a business partner , he would be quite wrong if he allowed himself to be guided by sympathy and sentiment . He must be able to trust the other fellow , trust his judgment , not just like him : what would happen if he joined up with a likeable scoundrel or a lovable halfwit ? The relationship would lead to loss and ultimately to ruin . Association demands and thrives under the monetary motive , and a business firm is an associational bond , not a communal one . The contrast between the two social formations is manifest . Yet let us remark straight away that it must not be exaggerated . No hurt arises for the community of husband and wife if the wife does bring a dowry , just as no harm comes to the association of partners in commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be strengthened through an admixture of the  | associational element , the association through a dash of communal feeling . Community and association are not mutually exclusive ; the question is merely , what predominates . Marriage bond and business firm are forms in society rather than forms of society , but Tonnes ' dichotomy applies to forms of society as well . An example that springs to mind at once is that of town and country . The village has more communal traits than associational ones , whereas the situation is the other way round in a typical town . And this fact reflects not only a spatial , but also a historical contrast . Older societies were communal rather than associational , newer societies are associational rather than communal ( a truth which Tonnes elaborates without nostalgia or sentimentality ) . We need only compare a primitive clan with a capitalist society . The clansmen thought of themselves as incarnations of the same life ; buyers and sellers , or employers and employees , assuredly do not . Tonnies pursues this basic dichotomy into many of its ramifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a helping hand is one thing in a community , and quite another thing in an associational setting . In a community it comes under the heading of neighbourliness , in an association under that of business . Charging interest is unbecoming in the one context and a matter of course in the other : hence the prohibition of usury in precapitalist societies and its regular presence ( though under a less pejorative name ) in modern capitalist societies . Or take the relationship of superior and inferior , master and man . How different is the mutual attitude between a farmer or peasant and his helpers from that of a factory owner and his hands ! It is not , as Tonnes explains it , a difference in value , as if the one set of relations were good and the other bad . It is , rather , a difference in kind . In a community superior and inferior may like or loathe each other , and dipping the bread into the same bowl may as easily lead to more loathing as to greater liking : but whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of psychological involvement , and this is characteristic of community , as its absence is characteristic of association . The shareholder who , in a modern concern , is the employer of his plant 's employees is not a real person at all to those whose labour he buys , nor , for that matter , is the manager who does the actual managing . The factory director is at best a name to the workers , and so is the worker to the factory directors .  | In the context of the present investigation , the great importance of Tunnies ' discussion and distinction consists in this : that ( as he himself clearly realised ) the two types of social ordering which he sets against each other demand for their description different images . Community is a unity rather than a diversity , and so calls up the image of unitary substances , e.g. that of the body physical . Association is a diversity rather than a unity , and so it calls up the contrary image of distinct , if related , forces , e.g. those that pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up . This recognition , too , is to be found right at the beginning of Tunnies ' text . Human wills stand in manifold relations to one another .. . The relationship itself . . . is according to its degree of integration conceived of either as real and organic life ? this is the essential characteristic of Gemeinschaft , or as imaginary and mechanical structure ? this is the concept of Gesellschaft . Gemeinschaft . . . . is the lasting and genuine form of living together . In contrast to Gemeinschaft , Gesellschaft is transitory and superficial . Accordingly , Gemeinschaft should be understood as a living organism , Gesellschaft as a mechanical aggregate and artifact . ' As can be seen , Tunnies appears to justify both traditional forms of sociology , realism as well as nominalism . But this means in effect that he justifies neither ? indeed , that he invalidates both . For , as we have already emphasised , community and association are not , in life , separate phenomena ; they are separate only in thought , by virtue of definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every social relationship represents unity in plurality or plurality in unity . ' Every social relationship is therefore bound to exhibit organism-like and mechanism-like features , though , of course , in accordance with its character , in different proportions . Tunnies underlines this with all due emphasis . He divides only in order to unite . No relationship could possibly come nearer to the symbiotic , organismic pattern than that of mother and child ; for a while they are literally one body . Yet hardly has the separation taken place , when associational elements appear . Even breastfeeding rests on selfish urges , hunger on the one side , relief from glandular pressure on the other . No relationship , on the other hand , could possibly come nearer to the mechanistic-contractual pattern than that of exchange ; while they yet higgle and haggle ,  | the negotiators are literally pulling against each other . But hardly has agreement been reached , when communal elements appear . Both partners are benefited by the business deal they have arranged . And as it is the tendency for children to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tendency for buyers and sellers to renew their contacts and contracts and to make permanent what was , to begin with , but momentary and transitory . To speak realistically of society , means therefore to speak of organism and mechanism at the same time ? in other words , it means constantly to mix one 's metaphors . But this would be a bad , an unbearable thing . Where metaphors have to be mixed , it is far better to discard them . This , it would appear , is the logical consequence of Tonnies ' whole investigation . He makes it understandable that some societies ( those of the community type ) have conceptualised themselves in organismic language , others ( those of the associational type ) in mechanistic terms . But he forces us at the same time to conclude that both have in this way overlooked part of their reality : communities their associational , associations their communal side , and for this reason their social theories have not been , what they ought to have been , truth in its entirety . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created an intellectual climate in which the third sociology , the cultural school , could unfold and mature . We shall try to elucidate its essence in the next chapter ; here we should like to wind up by a look at the thinker who , perhaps more ably than any other , drew the necessary conclusions from the fact , increasingly recognised by all free from prejudice , that both philosophical realism and philosophical nominalism are inappropriate in sociological theory : Georg Simmel . We have seen that Simmel did not manage to preserve the necessary balance , that , in the end , he came down on the side of nominalism after all . But this regrettable lapse does not destroy the value of those parts of his work which are untainted by it . There is an old conflict over the nature of society ' , Simmel said in his address to the first meeting of the German Sociological Society in 1910 . One side mystically exaggerates its significance , contending that only through society is human life endowed with reality . The other regards it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realities , which are individual human beings , into a whole , as one calls trees and brooks , houses  | and meadows , a " landscape " . However one decides this conflict , he must allow society to be a reality in a double sense . On the one hand are the individuals in their directly perceptible existence , the bearers of the processes of association , who are united by these processes into the higher unity which one calls " society " ; on the other hand , the interests which , living in the individuals , motivate such union : economic and ideal interests , warlike and erotic , religious and charitable . To satisfy such urges and to attain such purposes , arise the innumerable forms of social life , all the with-one-another , for-one-another , in-one-another , against-oneanother , and through-one-another , in state and commune , in church and economic associations , in family and clubs . " These words show , to some extent , Simmel 's bias towards individualism and formalism , but they also show the distinctive nature of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him neither a fact of the objective world nor a fiction of human discourse : it is a tertium quid . Simmel has risen superior to the limitations of the man in the street and those kindred ones characteristic of the earlier sociologists . Equally dominated by materialism , the only alternative they ever saw was that between something and nothing . Simmel understood that society is certainly no thing , but also that it is not , for that reason , nothing . It consists of those invisible and intangible , but nevertheless decidedly real threads which go from man to man and weave a network between them and around them . It is , properly understood , an interhurnan reality . One of the most significant passages in Simmel 's Soiologie are the pages in which he discusses solitude . Solitude must not be contrasted with sociality , for sociality remains in and through solitude , and this proves that the social element is not secondary in man ( though it does not have the undivided primacy either ) . The concept of solitude ' , Simmel writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , but precisely its somehow imagined and only subsequently negated presence . Solitude receives its unambiguously positive meaning as a distant effect of society ? either as an echo of past , or as an anticipation of future , relationships , either as longing or as conscious rejection . . . The whole bliss and the whole bitterness of solitude are surely only  | different reactions to influences received in society ; solitude is a form of interaction from which the one side has been realiter withdrawn . . . and continues to live and act only idealiter in the mind of the other subject ' ( So ( ( iologie , p. 77 ) . When man is alone , then precisely do we see that he is neither a mere individual , nor yet a mere collective creature ( p. 719 ) . If the social element is in this way co-constitutive even of man in isolation , any extreme nominalism would be erroneous , though any extreme realism would be no less so . Simmel reminds his readers that , according to Kant , nature is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he insists , can not be said of society . Society is an objective unity which does not require for the establishment of its unitary character an observer uncontained in it . . . The things of nature . . . are further from each other than human souls ; the union of one man with another which lies in understanding , in love , in common effort ? there is no analogue to it in the spatial world , in which every entity occupies its own place which can not be shared with any other ' ( p. 29 ) . In this book ' , Simmel also writes , I describe the living functional interaction of elements as their unity . It is more than their mere summation and stands sociologically in contrast to it ' ( p. 66 ) . Simmel is at his best , and particularly profound , where he tries to make it clear that some of man 's most deep-rooted mental habits militate against a proper comprehension of the phenomenon of sociality . The very words by means of which we must do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and society ' , but this whole distinction is altogether spurious and nefarious . The individual is in a double position : he is comprised in society and at the same time stands over against it ; he is a member of the social organism and at the same time himself a closed organic whole ; he is a life unto himself and a life for society . The essential point . . . is that " inside " and " outside " . . . are not two determinations which stand side by side ? even though they may , on occasions , develop into mutual hostility ? but describe the altogether unitary position of man living in society . His existence is not only , when its contents are divided up , partially social and partially individual : it stands under the fundamental , realitydetermining , not further reducible category of a unity which we can not express otherwise than by saying that it is a synthesis or coterminousness of the two logically contradictory qualities of being  | member and being independent , being created by , and contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own vital centre and for the sake of it . Society does not consist of individuals who are partially non-social , but of beings who experience themselves on the one hand as fully social existences and on the other ? preserving the same substance ? as fully personal ones . These are not two points of view which would lie side by side without relation . . . but they form between them a unit which we call a social creature , a synthetic category ' ( pp. 40 , 41 ) . All this may sound unduly complex , but the complexity lies more in our language than in life . In life ? in social life ? unity and diversity are simply one , and they are one because interrelation , the very essence of sociality , fuses them together . From this vantage-point Simmel discovered a whole new world of social phenomena which the sociological realists and the sociological nominalists had both failed to notice . The simple act of self-adornment ? putting on lipstick or choosing a bright necktie ? has , for Simmel , sociological importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social commerce , in inter-human relationships . The discussion of artificial scent and its use ( pp. 659 et seq. ) is an example of this widening of the sociological interest . The organicists , with their tendency to play up the social factor , had always seen more than the mechanicists ; but even they had been half blind , for they had investigated only those phenomena of human interaction which had become solidified , and never those which were , so to speak , still in solution . They had spoken about marriage , not about coquetry , about law-courts , not about lying , about war , not about hate . What is so great about Simmel is the wide sweep of his net . He could truly say with Terence : Homo sum ; humani nihil a me alienum puto ? I am a man ; nothing that pertains to man is for me a matter of unconcern . His was a human science of human society , and this most radically distinguishes him from those who aped the sciences of the subhuman spheres . What we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , of course , his definition of society . This , as we have seen already , is simple enough . Society exists where several individuals enter into interaction ' ( p. 5 ) . A plurality of elements becomes a unity ' ( p. 21 ) . Nothing could be more elementary and nothing more true ? yet those who are caught in the false alternative : thing or nothing , have always resisted Simmel 's intermediate concept of sociality . It is said that the wild Irish could
