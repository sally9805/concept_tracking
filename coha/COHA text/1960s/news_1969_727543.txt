txt Gilbert Miller , for more than half a century a major Broadway and London producer , died in his sleep yesterday at his Park Avenue home . He was 84 years old . Mr. Miller 's career spanned the years from before World War I until the mid-1960 's , an era that saw many changes in theatrical content and approach and brought the American stage to pre-eminence . Gilbert Heron Miller was born into show business , which was not his doing ; he made a success out of it , which was . Although he came from a show business family , it was his own stamina , talent and luck that made him chalk up an enviable proportion of hits among the 99 shows that he helped raise the curtain on . In his more than 50 years as producer and , sometimes , director he introduced Audrey Hepburn , Charles Laughton , Leslie Howard and Alec Guinness to Broadway . Helen Hayes starred in six Miller productions , Katherine Cornell in five . He never haggled over price with an actor he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as he was on Broadway . He brought French plays to New York in such quantity that he once had to explain , " There 's nothing that would elate me more than to lay hands on a good , virile American play , one that would eloquently reflect the trying times in which we live , the hopes we nourish , and the fears that torture us . " Yet social protest was not Mr. Miller 's cup of tea . He did do well with " Journey 's End , " an antiwar play , in 1929 , but his hallmarks were elegant characters , stylish sets and cultured dialogue unfortified by shrieks or clenched fists . If he promoted any type of play at all , he plumped for high comedy . The authors he produced were known for literate dialogue . He did Somerset Maugham 's " The Constant Wife , " Philip Barry 's " The Animal Kingdom , " Dylan Thomas 's " Under Milk Wood , " T. S. Eliot 's " The Cocktail Party , " Sherwood Anderson 's " The Petrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Laurence Housman 's play about Queen Victoria and Prince Albert . It opened in New York on Aug. 31 , 1936 , starring Miss Hayes , and grossed more than $2.5-million . At one time he owned three theaters : Henry Miller 's on West 43d Street here , which was named for his father and sold in 1968 , and the St. James and the Lyric in London . The St. James has been demolished but Mr. Miller owned the Lyric at his death . Fond of Rich Foods Mr. Miller was the kind of man for whom the word rotund was designed . He was round and jowly , often given to dieting without appreciable success . His ideal after-theater refection cascaded calories ; a grapefruit with a soupgon of kirsch , hot crabmeat in cream ( or , perhaps , a saute of veal kidneys lyonnaise ) , an endive salad , coffee parfait and coffee . The producer could present a smooth exterior to the world , refusing to duel with critics or complain about their comments on his productions . He had a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be the despair of his secretaries . " Miller is almost like Sheridan Whiteside in ' The Man Who Came to Dinner , ' only more expensive , " said a friend . " His outward smoothness masks an unexpected naivet ? . " For all his sophistication , a directness of thought occasionally seeped out . Jed Harris , a director , once remarked that no Broadway producer had any intelligence . Mr. Miller later asked a critic he knew , " What did Harris mean ? " Does n't he know that during the first World War I worked in intel-ligence ? " Linguist and Pilot Despite his weight , Mr. Miller was an energetic , lively man . He was a linguist ( French , Italian , Spanish , German and Hungarian ) , a raconteur , an art collector , a crack shot and the pilot of his own plane . A glimpse of Mr. Miller In action comes from a passage in Noel Coward 's autobiography , " Present Indicative " : " He asked me to supper at the Midland , and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human and unmanagerial . We chatted and he told me several plots of plays that his father had produced in New York . " He told them in detail and with tremendous vivacity , occasionally rearranging the knives and forks and plates to illustrate the most dramatic passages . " At one moment he actually sprang up from his chair and shouted : ' Never , never , never ! ' loudly , much to the dismay of the head waiter . Finally he left me in order to catch the midnight train back to London . " He also gave me some useful pieces of advice on the art of playwriting . He said , among other things , that although my dialogue was good , my construction was lousy . " He said that someone had told his father , who in turn , had told him , that the con- ' struction of a play was as important as the foundations of a house , whereas dialogue , however good , could only , at best , he considered as interior decoration . This I recognized immediately as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn In New York on July 3 , 1884 . His father was Henry Miller , an actor-manager who had achieved eminence in theater . His mother , Bijou Heron , was an actress and so was her mother , Matilda Heron . Young Gilbertattended Roman Catholic schools in Germany , Spain , England and France . He worked for a bank in the United States for a while and then , before World War 1 , served with the Marines in Haiti . His first formal affiliation with theater was as an actor , in " Julie Bon-Bon , " in London . His father did not encourage his acting career , " 1 had served three years in the U.S. Marine Corps when my father named me company manager of a touring company of ' The Great Divide ' in 1907 , " Mr. Miller later recalled . " Buoyed by this parental vote of confidence 1 rushed out and bought a fur overcoat , that culture lovers I encountered on my travels might be properly Impressed with my consequence .

" He managed all Henry Miller productions between 1910 and 1915 and made his debut as a producer in 1916 with " Daddy Long-Legs " in London 's Duke of York 's Theater . The show ran for 514 performances , 53 weeks . Earlier his father had been able to get only 33 weeks out of the comedy in a New York production , and the son took pride in eclipsing his parent 's showing . For the next six years , he worked in London , presenting 10 shows . His biggest hit was " Monsieur Beaucaire , " an operetta by Andre Massager based on Booth Tarkington 's comedy of the same name . In December , 1919 , he brought " Beaucaire " to New York and , as he said later , " I saw my name glow over a New York show for the first time . " It was the only musical he ever produced . In 1922 , as he was working on " The Czarina , " his second New York venture , Mr. Miller became producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frohman , Inc. , a producing unit that imported plays . Wed Financier 's Daughter In 1927 he married Kathryn Bache , the daughter of Jules S. Bache , art collector and head of the banking house of J. S. Bache &; until his death in 1944 . Mrs. Miller , known as Kitty , was often closely associated with her husband 's producing ventures . She is prominent in New York and London society . In the 1927-28 season , Mr. Miller had four hits beckoning Broadway playgoers , each returning a weekly net profit of $10,000 . They were " The Captive , " with Helen Menken and Basil Rathbone ; " The Play 's the Thing , " with Holbrook Blinn ; " The Constant Wife , " with Ethel Barrymore , and " Her Cardboard Lover , " with Jeanne Eagles and Leslie Howard . He was pleased enough with " The Play 's the Thing " to take it to the West End . " I was to learn that New York 's hit may be London 's poison , " he wrote later . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 10 performances . " Mr. Miller apparently had no trouble getting money for his plays . He put it up himself , in contrast to the current practice of gathering angels to produce a show . He also had little difficulty with casting problems because of his willingness to negotiate contracts to performers ' liking . Profitable ' Journey 's End ' In 1929 , when Mr. Miller was painfully learning that Wall Street was less trustworthy than even flighty Broadway , he found success , unexpectedly , with " Journey 's End , " a play by R. C. Sherriff that commented on the horrors of war . He had booked the British troupe into Henry Miller 's Theater for three weeks and scheduled it for another three in Canada . This took care of the six weeks ' work he guaranteed the troupe . " Journey 's End " remained in New York for 60 weeks and Mr. Miller organized three touring companies . He later said that the production cost of the show was $1,500 . In its first week , he said , he made back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another of his British imports , " Witness for the Prosecution , " took 16 weeks to break even after its 1954 opening here . Over the years , Ile brought to London many shows produced in New York under other auspices . Among these were " Strange Interlude , " " The Women , " " Pride and Prejudice " and " Dear Ruth . " In 1936 , at a time when he had just weathered a series of flops ( balancing some of his theater losses , however , with victories in the foreign exchange market ) , he put " Victoria Regina " on Broadway . Helen Hayes and the play itself were a shattering success . " Victoria Regina " toured 43 cities , breaking box-office records as it went . In the 1950 's Mr. Miller found Audrey Hepburn and Associated Press Mr- Miller in 1965 starred her in " Gigi , " the Anita Loos adaptation of a Colette novel . It , too , was a hit . He also presented " The Rope Dancers " by Morton Wishengrad , Terence Rattigan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Reluctant Debutante . " Mr. Miller 's last time out on Broadway was in 1965 as coproducer of " Diamond Orchid , " a play directed by Jose Quintero and starring Jennifer West . It folded after five performances . Mr. Miller once recalled with amusement that his father had told him , " Your success , my boy , will be the triumph of memory over a second-rate imagination . " He divided his time between ( London and New York , living here in a 12-room apartment at 550 Park Avenue , decorated with paintings by Renoir , Dufy and Goya . The Millers had a house in London and a 17thcentury country home in Sussex , England . Mr. Miller was a director of the League of New York Theaters , first vice president of the Actors Fund and a member of the Players Club here , Bucks Club in London and the Travelers Club in Paris .
