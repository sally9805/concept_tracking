txt so DEPOSITION OF RICHARD 11 , Richard was compelled to call a Parliament , and at the moment it met to pronounce his own abdication . The Parliament was not contented with accepting this ; it wished to put an end to all doubt for the future , and to establish its own right for ever . A long list of articles was drawn up , from which it was concluded that the King had broken his coronation oath and forfeited his crown ; the assembled Estates , when severally and conjointly consulted , held them sufficient to justify them in proceeding to the King 's deposition . They named Proctors , two for the clergy , two for the high nobility ? one for the earls and dukes , the other for the barons and bannerets , two for the knights and commons ? one for the Northern , the other for the Southern counties . They sat as a court of justice before the vacant throne , with the Chief Justice in their midst : then the first spiritual commissioner , the Bishop of S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and under the authority of the Estates of the realm announced the sentence of deposition against the late King , and forbade all men to receive any further commands from him . Some opposition was raised ; it is said that the Bishop of Carlisle very expressly denied the right of subjects to sit in judgment on their hereditary sovereign ' ; but how could this have had any effect against the Parliament 's claim which had been formulated so long ? As the crown was now regarded as vacant , Henry of Lancaster arose , ? in the name of God , as he said , whilst he made the sign of the cross on his forehead and breast , ? to claim it for himself , in virtue of his birth and the right which accrued to him through God and the help of his friends . It was not properly speaking an election that now took place : the spiritual and lay lords , as well as the other members of the Parliament , were asked what their opinion of his claim was : the answer of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conducted by the two archbishops , he ascended // the vacant throne , he was greeted with the joyous acclaim of those assembled . The Archbishop of Canterbury made a speech full of unction , the drift of which was , that henceforth it would not be a child , such as the late sovereign had been , selfwilled and void of understanding , but a Man that would rule over them , in the full maturity of his understanding , and resolved to do not so much his own will as the will of God ' . Thus did the spiritual and lay nobility , in and with the Parliament , make good their claim to dispose of the crown . They went to work against Richard II with less reserve than against Edward II . In the latter case the Queen had taken part in the movement ; they had set the son in his father 's stead . But this time they did not wait for the actual consummation of the King 's marriage ; they raised a prince to the throne who had openly opposed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in succession . For there were still the descendants of an elder brother left , who according to English usage had a prior right . The Parliament held itself competent to settle on its own authority even the succession to the crown . It enacted that it should belong to the King 's eldest son , and after him to his male issue , and on their failure to his brothers and their issue . The proposal formally to exclude succession in the female line did not pass ; but for a long while to come the actual practice had that effect . Besides the motives involved in the extension of the Power of the Estates in and for itself there was yet another reason for such a proceeding . And this arose out of the growth , and increasing urgency , of the religious divisions . The Lollards preached , and taught in schools , according to their views : in the year 1396 in a petition to Parliament they traced all the moral evils and defects of the world to the fact that the clergy were endowed with worldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application of these to the service of the state and the prosecution of war 2 . They // seem to have flattered themselves that by this they would will over the lay lords , but they were completely mistaken . For these remarked on the contrary that their own property had no better legal foundation than that of the clergy and only attached themselves to the rights of the Church all the more zealously . That which would have been impossible under Richard II 's vacillating government , the first Lancaster now undertook : in full agreement with the Estates he a few days after his accession announced to Convocation that he purposed to destroy heretics and heresies to the best of his power 2 . In the next Parliament a statute was drawn up in which relapsed heretics were condemned to the flames . And still more remarkable than this mode of punishment , which was that of the Church-law , is the regulation of the procedure in this statute . In former times the sentence had been pronounced by the archbishop and the collective clergy of the province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it was executed . The decision was now committed to the bishop and his commissary , and the sheriff was instructed to inflict the punishment without further appeal , and to commit the guilty to the fire on the high grounds in the country , that terror might strike all the bystanders . It is clear how much the power of the bishops was thus extended . Soon after , on the proposal of the lay lords , at whose head the Prince of Wales is named , a further statute passed , in which to spread the rumour that King Richard was yet alive , and to teach that the prelates ought to be deprived of their worldly goods , are treated as offences of equal magnitude and threatened with a similar punishment ; the object being alike in both , ? to raise a tumult . And in fact , when Henry V himself had ascended the throne , an outbreak did occur , in which these causes co-operated . The Lollards were strengthened in their resistance to the government of the house of Lancaster by the // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V was obliged to crush them in open battle , and then force them to remain quiet by a new statute , which enacted the confiscation of their goods as well ' . His alliance and friendship with the Emperor Sigismund was based on the fact , that he regarded the Hussites as only the successors of the Lollards . This orthodox tendency was now moreover combined with a strict Parliamentary government . Under the Lancasters there is no complaint as to illegal taxes ; they allowed the moneys voted by the Parliament to be paid over to treasurers named by itself and accountable to it ; that which earlier Kings had always rejected as an affront , the claim of Parliament to exercise a sort of supervision over the King 's household , the Lancasters admitted ; the royal officers were bound by oath to observe the statutes and the common law ; the prerogative , hitherto exercised by the Kings , of softening the severity of the statutes by proclamations contravening their purpose was expressly abolished . The Lancasters owed their rise to their alliance with the clergy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of their government . The most manifold results might be expected , even beyond the borders of England , from their having by this very alliance won for themselves a great European position . Nowhere was greater interest taken in Richard 's fate than at the French court . Louis Duke of Orleans , whose voice was generally decisive there , once challenged the first Lancaster to a duel , and when he refused it pressed him hard with war . That Owen Glendower could once more maintain himself as Prince in Wales was entirely due to his French auxiliaries . That we find Henry IV more secure of his throne in his later years than in his earlier is a phenomenon the explanation of which we seek in vain in English affairs alone : it results from the fact that his powerful foe , Louis of Orleans , was murdered in the year 1407 at the instigation of John U 2 // Duke of Burgundy , and that then the quarrel of the two parties , which divided France , burst out with increased violence , and remained long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fear : they emulously sought the alliance of the highest power in England ; there even arose circumstances under which the Lancasters could think of renewing the claims of Edward III , from whom they too were descended . At the time that Henry V ascended the English throne , the Orleanists had again gained the preponderance in France : they unfurled the Oriflamme against the Duke of Burgundy , who was now in fact hard pressed . Henry negociated with them both . But while the Orleanists made difficulties about granting him the independent possession of the old English provinces , Burgundy declared himself ready to acknowledge him as King 1 . The common interests moreover of home politics allied him with this house . Henry could reckon on the sympathies of a part of the population of France , when he led the power of England across the sea . A successful battle in which he destroyed the flower of the French nobility gave him an undoubted superiority . The vengeance which the Orleanists wreaked even under these circumstances on the Duke of Burgundy , who was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely to his side , together with the greater part of the nation . Things went so far that Charles VI of France decided to marry his daughter to the victorious Lancaster and to acknowledge him , as his heir after his death , as his representative during his life . It was a very extraordinary position which Henry V now occupied . The two great kingdoms , each of which by itself has earlier or later claimed to sway the world , were ( without being fused into one ) to remain united for ever under him and his successors . Philip the Good of Burgundy was bound to him by ties of blood and by hostility to a // common foe : as heir of France Henry sat in the Parliament by which the murderers of the last duke , who were also the chief opponents of the new state of things , were prosecuted . Another promising connexion was opened to him by the marriage of the youngest of his brothers with Jaqueline of Holland and Hainault , who possessed still more extensive hereditary claims . Henry recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her son and heir . The King of Castile and the heir of Portugal were descended from his father 's sisters . The pedigrees of Southern and Western Europe alike met in the house of Lancaster , the head of which thus seemed to be the common head of all . In England Henry did not neglect to guard the rights of the National Church ; but at the same time no one exerted himself more energetically to close the schism : the solemn condemnation of Wiclif 's doctrines by the General Council of Constance served to vouch for his attitude in religious matters : the English Church obtained in it a place among the great National Churches . Henry V found himself in the advantageous position of a potentate raised to power by a usurpation for which he was not however personally responsible . He could spare and reinstate Richard II 's memory , as much as in him lay , though he owed the crown to his overthrow . That he furthered and advanced also in France the municipal and parliamentary interests , which were his mainstay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and a European influence . In his moral character Henry ranks above most of the Plantagenets . He had no favourites and let no unjust acts be imputed to him . He was stern towards the great and careful for the common people ; at his first word men could tell what they had to expect from him . The French were frightened at the keenness of his expression , but they reverenced his high spirit , his bravery and truthfulness . He transacts all his affairs himself ; he considers them well before he undertakes them ; he never does anything fruitlessly . He is free from excesses , and truthful : he never makes himself too familiar . On his face are visible dignity and supreme // power 1 . ' He possessed in full measure the bold impulses of his ancestors , their attention to the general affairs of Western Christendom . In the war with the Lollards he was once wounded ; that he recovered from his wound was designated as the work of divine Providence , which had destined him to be the conqueror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state as it was then constituted under the Mameluke rule : a Chronicle of Jerusalem and a History of Godfrey of Bouillon were two of the books he loved most to read . And without doubt such an undertaking would have been the true means , if any such means were possible , of uniting more closely , by common undertakings successes and interests , the realms already bound together under one sceptre . The Ottomans had not yet extended themselves in the East with their full force : something might yet have been effected there ; for the King of France and England , who was yet young in years , a great future seemed to be at hand . Sometimes it seems as though fortune were specially making a mock of man 's frailty . In this fulness of power and of expectations , Henry V was attacked by a disease which men did not yet know how to cure and to which he succumbed . His heir was a boy , nine months old . Of the two surviving brothers of the deceased King , the younger ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Realm , while the elder governed France with an increased participation on the part of the Estates : their efforts could only be directed towards preserving these kingdoms for their nephew Henry VI . We might almost wonder that this succeeded so well for a time : in the long run it was impossible . The feeling of French nationality , which had already met the victor himself with secret warnings , found its most wonderful expression in the Maid who revived in the French their old attachment to their native King and his divine right ; the English , when she fell into their hands , with ungenerous hate inflicted on her the punishment of the Lollards : but the Valois King had already gained a firm // footing . It was Charles VII who understood how to appease the enmity of Burgundy , and in unison with the great men of his kingdom to give his power a peculiar organisation corresponding to its character , so that he was able to oppose to the English troops better armed than their own , and make the restoration of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on England in two ways . The government , which was inclined for peace , fell into as bitter a quarrel as any that had hitherto taken place with the national bodies politic , which either did not recognise this necessity , or attributed the disasters incurred to bad management . The man most trusted by the King fell a victim to the public hate . But , besides this , there arose ? awakened by these events and in a certain analogy with what happened in France ? the recollection of the rights which had been set aside by the accession of the house of Lancaster . Their representative , Richard Duke of York , had hitherto kept quiet ; for he was fully convinced that a right can not perish merely because it lies dormant . Cautiously and step by step , while letting others run the first risk , he at last came forward openly with his claim to the crown . Great was the astonishment of Henry VI , who as far as his memory reached had been regarded as King , to find his right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the case . The nation was split into two parties , one of which held fast to the monarchy established by the Parliament , while the other wished to recur to the principle of legitimate succession then violated . Not that political conviction was the leading motive for their quarrel . First of all we find that the opponents of the government ? though themselves of Parliamentary views ? rallied round the banners of the hitherto forgotten right of birth . Every man fought , less for the prince whose device he bore , the red or the white rose , than for his own share in the enjoyment of political power . On both sides there arose chiefs of almost independent power , who clad their partisans in their own colours , at whose call those partisans were ready any moment to take arms : they appointed the sheriffs in the counties and were lords cf the land . But when blood had once been shed , no reconciliation of the parties was possible . Ha , cried // the victor to the man who begged for mercy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . In vain did men turn to the judges : for the statutes contradicted each other , and they could no longer decide where the right lay . From the Parliaments no solution of these questions could be expected ; each served the victorious party , whose summons it obeyed , and condemned its opponent . As the resources on each side were tolerably equal , even the battles were not decisive : the result depended less upon real superiority than on accidental desertions or accessions , and most largely on foreign help . After the English had failed , during the antagonism of Valois and Burgundy , in establishing their supremacy on the Continent , the quarrel ? quieted for a moment ? which broke out again between Louis XI and Charles the Bold in the most violent manner , reacted on them with all the more vehemence . King Louis would not endure that a good understanding should exist between Edward IV and Duke Charles , to whom Edward had married his sister : he drew the man who had hitherto done the most for the Yorkist interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side ; and scarcely had the latter appeared in England when Edward IV was forced to fly and Henry VI was reinstated . Louis had prepared church-thanksgivings to God for having given the English a king of the blood of France and a friend to that country . But meanwhile Edward was helped by Charles the Bold , to whom he had fled , though not openly in arms , yet with ships which he hired for him , with considerable sums of money , and even with troops which he allowed to join him ' . To these , his Flemish and Easterling troops , it was chiefly attributed that Edward gained the upper hand in the field and recovered his throne . But what a state of things was this ! The glorious crown of the Plantagenets , who a little while before strove for the supremacy of the world , was now ? stained with-blood and powerless as it was ? tossed to and fro between the rival parties . BOOK II . ATTEMPTS TO CONSOLIDATE THE KINGDOM INDEPENDENTLY IN ITS TEMPORAL AND SPIRITUAL RELATIONS . WE may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that England became completely a member of the Romano-German family of nations which formed the Western world . In however many ways the invading nobility had mingled with the native houses , it yet held fast to its ancient language ; even now it is part of the ambition of the great families to trace their pedigree from the Conquerors . Attempts had been made , sometimes of a more political , sometimes of a more doctrinal nature , to break loose from the hierarchy , which prevailed throughout these nations ; but they had only increased its strength ; the native clergy saw that its safety lay in the strictest adherence to the maxims of the Universal Church . Similarly the character of the Estates in England was akin to that of those in North France and especially in the Netherlands ; on this rests the sympathy which the enterprises of Edward III and Henry V met with ; for it was indeed the feeling of these centuries , that the members of any one of the three Estates felt themselves quite as closely bound to the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrymen of the other Estates . There was but one Church , one Science , one Art in Europe : one and the same mental horizon enclosed the different peoples : a romance and a poetry varying in form yet of closely kindred nature was the common possession of all . The common life of Europe flowed also in the veins of England : an indestructible foundation for culture and progressive civilisation was laid . But we saw to what point matters had come notwithstanding , as regards the durability of its internal system and its power . The Plantagenets had extended the rule of England over Scotland and Ireland : in the latter it still subsisted , but only within the narrow limits of the Border Pale ; in the former it was altogether overthrown . The best result that had been effected in home politics , the attempt to unite the Powers of the country in Parliament had , after a short and brilliant success , led to the deepest disorder by disregarding the rights of birth . The degraded crown above all had thus become the prize of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could not possibly remain thus . The time was come to give the English realm an independent position and internal order corresponding at once to its insular situation and to the degree of culture it had attained . The first who attempted this with some success was Edward IV , of the house of York , who in the war of the Roses had remained master of the field . But everywhere there began once more an era of autocratic princes . CHAPTER I. RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SUPREME POWER . EDWARD IV was a most brilliant figure , the handsomest man of his time , at least among the sovereigns , so that the impression he thus made was actually a power in politics ; we find him incessantly entangled in love affairs : he was fond of music and enjoyment of all kinds , the pleasures of the table , the uproar of riotous company : his debauched habits are thought to have shortened his life , and many a disaster sprung from his carelessness ; but he had also Sardanapalus ' nature in him : with quickly awakening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his battles he appeared the last , but he fought perhaps the best ; and he won them all . In the history of European Monarchy he is not unworthy to be ranked by the side of Ferdinand the Catholic , Charles the Bold , Louis XI , and some others who regained prestige for their dignity by the energy of their personal character . In itself we must rate it as important that he made good the birthright of the house of York , independent as it was of the maxims of Parliament , or rather contradictory to them , and maintained the throne . He deemed himself the direct successor of Richard II ; the three kings who had since worn the crown by virtue of Parliamentary enactments were regarded by him as usurpers . We have Fortescue 's contemporary treatise in praise of the laws of England , which ( written for a prince who never came to the throne ) contains the idea of Parliamentary right which the house of Lancaster upheld : but Edward IV did not so apprehend it . He allowed the lawfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was of use to him : // but otherwise he paid little regard to its established rights . We find under him for five years no meeting of Parliament ; then a Parliament that had met was prorogued some four or five times without completing any business , till it at last agreed to raise the customs duties , included under the names of Tonnage and Poundage ; a revenue which being voted to the Kings for life ( and this came gradually to be regarded as a mere formality ) gave their government a strong financial basis . Other Parliaments repaid their summons with considerable grants , with large and full subsidies : yet Edward IV was not content even with these . Under him began the practice , by which the wealthy were drawn into contributions for his service in proportion to their property , of which the King knew how to obtain accurate information ; these contributions were called Benevolences because they were paid under the form of personal freewill offerings , though none dared to refuse them : we may compare the imposts which in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their opponents . Though holding Church views in other points , and at any rate a persecutor of the Lollards , he did not however allow the clergy to enter on their temporalities without heavy payments : he created monopolies in the case of some especially profitable articles of trade . In short , he neglected no means to render the administration of the supreme power independent of the money-grants of Parliament . He made room for the royal prerogative as understood by the old kings , as well as for the right of birth . , But yet he had not established a secure position , since the party of the enemy was still very powerful , and after his early death a quarrel broke out in his own house which could not fail to destroy it . To the characteristic traits of the Plantagenets , their worldwide views , their chivalry abroad , their versatility at home , // the ceaseless war they waged with each other and with others for power , their inextinguishable love of rule , belongs also the way in which those who held power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly King John had murdered in prison Arthur the lawful heir to the throne , so Richard II imprisoned and murdered his uncle Thomas of Gloucester , who was dangerous to himself . Richard II , like Edward II , died by the hand of a relatve who had wrested the crown from him ; of the details of his death we have not even a legend left . Another Gloucester , who had for many years guarded the crown for the infant Henry VI , was , at the very moment when he might become dangerous to the new government , found dead in his bed . So Henry VI perished in the Tower the day before Edward IV made his entry into London . Edward IV preferred to have his brother Clarence , though already under sentence of death , privately killed . But the most atrocious murder of all was that of the two infant sons of Edward IV himself ; they were both murdered at once , as was fully believed , at the behest of their uncle Richard III , who had put himself in possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of Richard answered to that type of inborn wickedness which commits crime because it wills it as crime , such as following the hints of the Chronicle ' a great poet has drawn for us in imperishable traits , and linked with his name : or whether it was not rather the love of power , that animated the whole family , which in Richard III grew step by step into a passion that made him forget all laws human and divine : enough , he did such deeds that the world 's abhorrence weighs justly on him . But it was owing to the internal discord of the ruling family that throughout the course of its history a path was made for political and national development , and so it was now : these crimes opened a way out of the disorders of the time . For as Richard , while continuing to persecute the house of Lancaster , struck still harder blows against the chief members // of that of York , he gave occasion to the principal persons of both parties , who were equally threatened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw nearer to each other . The widowed Queen Elizabeth , who was lingering out her life in a sanctuary , was brought into secret connexion through the mediation of distinguished friends with the mother of the man who now came forward as head of the Lancasters , Henry Earl of Richmond , and it was determined that Henry and Elizabeth 's daughter , in whom the claims of both lines were united , should marry each other , a prospect which might well prepare the way for the immediate combination of the two parties . Henry of Richmond at their head was then to confront the usurper and chase him from the throne . The fugitives scattered about in the sanctuaries and churches called him to be their captain 1 . The question arises ? it has been often answered in the negative ? whether Henry was rightfully a Lancaster , and whether he had any well-grounded claims on the English crown . He loved to derive his family from the hero of the Welsh , the fabulous Arthur . His grandfather , Owen Tudor , a Welshman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage with Henry V 's widow , Catharine of France : for unions of royal ladies with distinguished gentlemen were then not rare . And Owen Tudor of course obtained by this a higher position , but there could be no question of any claim to the crown . This was derived simply from the fact that the son of this marriage , Edmund Tudor Earl of Richmond , married a lady of the house of Somerset , descended by her father from John of Gaunt , the ancestor of the Lancasters , by his third marriage with Catharine Swynford . It has been said that this marriage , in itself of an irregular nature , was only recognised as legitimate by Richard II on the condition that the issue from it should have no claim to the succession ? and so it is in fact stated in the often printed Patent . But the original of the document still exists , and that in two // forms , one of which is in the Rolls of Parliament , the other on the Patent Rolls . In the first the limitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an interpolation by a later hand . It may be taken as admitted that Richard 1I in legitimising the marriage did not make this condition , and that it was first inserted by Henry IV ( who took offence at the legitimisation of his half-brothers ) at the ratification . But the legitimisation once effected could not possibly be limited in a one-sided manner by a later sovereign . I think no objection can be made to the legality of Henry VIPs claim , which then passed over to his successors ' . The limitation belonged to those proceedings of one-sided caprice by which Henry IV tried to secure for his direct descendants the perpetual possession of the crown . It was not from him , but from his father , the founder of the family , that the Earls of Richmond derived their claim . Now that the banner of a true Lancaster appeared again in the field , and the discontented Yorkists , ill-treated by Richard , joined him , it might certainly be hoped that the usurper would be overthrown , and that a strong power would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue was even then very doubtful . As in the earlier civil wars , so now too the help of a foreign power was necessary . With French help the Earl of Richmond led about 2000 men , of which not more than perhaps 800 were English , to Wales 2 ; in his further advance he was joined by proportionately considerable reinforcements ; yet he did not number more than 5000 men under his banners , badly clothed and still worse armed , when Richard with his chivalry came upon him in overwhelming numbers . Henry would have been lost , had he not found partisans in Richard 's ranks . Even before the engagement the desertion from // Richard began : then in the middle of the battle the chief division of his army passed over to Henry . Richard found the death he sought : for he was resolved to be King or die : on the battlefield itself Henry was proclaimed King . There is no doubt that he owed to his union with the house of York , whose right was then generally regarded as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition also which he experienced afterwards : yet his whole nature revolted against basing his state on this union : he cherished the ambition of ruling only through his own right . At the first meeting of Parliament , which he did not call till he was fully in possession and crowned King , he was met by a very genuinely English point of law . It arose from the fact that many members of the Lower House had been attainted by the late government . How could they make laws who were themselves beyond the pale of law ? Who could cleanse them from the stain that clove to them ? This objection could be raised against Henry himself . In this perplexity recourse was had to the judges : and they decided that the possession of the crown supplied all defects , and that the King was already King even without the assent of Parliament t . In the general disorder things had gone so far , that it was necessary to find some power outside the continuity of legal forms , from which they might start afresh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living centre round which the legal state could again form itself . By exercising the authority inherent in the possession of the crown , the King could effect the revocation of the sentences that weighed on his partisans and on a large portion of the Parliament . After the legal character of that Assembly had been established , it proceeded to recognise Henry 's rights to the crown in the words used for the first of the Lancastrian house . In the papal bull which ratified Henry 's succession , three grounds are assigned for it : the right of war , the undoubted nearest right to the succession , and the recognition by ParTHE // liament . On the first the King himself laid great stress : he once designates the issue of the battle as the decision of God between him and his foes . He thus avoided any mention of the marriage with Edward IV 's daughter , which he did not complete till he was acknowledged on all sides . The papal bull declared that the crown of England was to be hereditary in Henry 's descendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage . We can easily understand this : Henry would not tolerate by his side in the person of his wife a joint ruler of equal , and even better , right than his own ; but we can understand also that this proceeding drew on him new enmities . At the very outset the widowed Queen gave it to be understood that her daughter was rather lowered than raised by the marriage . The whole party of York ? moreover felt itself contemned and insulted . To the ferment of displeasure and ambition into which it fell must be attributed the fact that a pair of adventurers , who acted the part of genuine descendants of the house of York , Lambert Simnel and Perkin Warbeck , supported from abroad , found the greatest sympathy and recognition in England . The first Henry VII had to meet in open battle , the second he got into his hands only by a great European combination . But he did not wish to have always to encounter open disturbance . He was entirely of the opinion which his chancellor gave , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sword of war , but only by well-planned and stringent laws which would destroy the seed of rebellion , and by institutions strong enough to administer those laws . Above all he found it intolerable that the great men kept numerous dependents attached to them under engagements which were publicly paraded by distinctive badges . The lower courts of justice and the juries did not do the service expected from them in dealing with the transgressions of the law that came before them . Uncertainty as to the supreme authority , and the power which the great party-leaders exercised , filled the weaker , who had to sit in judgment on them , with dread of their sure revenge . To put an end to this disorder Henry VII established the Starchamber . With II 2 zoo RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF r. consent of the Parliament , from which all hostile partymovements were excluded , he gave his Privy Council , which was strengthened by the chief judges , a strong organisation with this end in view . It was to punish all those personal engagements , the exercise of unlawful influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lastly to have power to deal with the early symptoms of a tumult before it came to an outbreak , and that under forms which were not usual in the English administration of justice . This powerful instrument in the hands of government might be much abused ; but then seemed necessary to keep in check unreconciled enemies and the spirit of faction that was ever surging up again . We see the prevailing state of things from the fact , that the King 's councillors themselves , to be secured against acts of violence , passed a special law , which characterised attacks on them as attacks on the King himself . But then , like men who stood in the closest connexion with the King and his State , they used their authority with unapproachable severity . The internal tranquillity of England has been thought to be mainly due to the erection of this court of justice 1 . Since Henry laid so much stress on his being a Lancaster , it might have been expected that he would revive the rights of the Parliament . But in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He too imposed Benevolences , like Edward IV , and that to a yet greater extent ; he made an ordinance that what was voluntarily promised should be exacted with as much strictness as if it were an ordinary tax . Another source of financial gain , which has brought on him still worse reproaches , was his commission against infractions of the law . It was inevitable that in the fluctuation of authority and of the statutes themselves innumerable illegalities should have taken place . And they were still always going on . The King took it especially ill that men omitted to pay the dues which belonged to the crown ill // right of its feudal superiority . All these negligences and failures were now visited and punished with the severity of the old Norman system , and at the same time with the officiousness of party-men of the day , who saw their own advantage in it . This proceeding pressed very many heavily on private persons and communities , and ruined families , but it filled the King 's coffers . One of his maxims was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another that a sovereign who would enjoy consideration must always have money : in this instance both worked together . If we look at the lists of his receipts we find that they consist , as in other kingdoms , of the crown 's revenue proper , which was considerably increased by the escheated possessions of great families which had become extinct , the customs duties settled on him for life , the tenth from the clergy , and the feudal clues . It was estimated that they produced nearly the same revenue as that of the French kings at this time , but it was remarked that the King of England only spent about two-thirds of his income . He did not need a Parliamentary grant , especially as he kept out of dangerous foreign entanglements . In his last thirteen years he never once called a Parliament . This precisely corresponded to the idea of his government . After all had become doubtful owing to the alternate fluctuations of parties he had established his personal claim by the fortune of arms , and made it the central point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be again endangered by the ceaseless ebb and flow of popular opinion ? he founded a supreme court independent of popular agitation , a finance system independent of the grants of a popular assembly . But he thus found himself under the disadvantage of having to apply compulsion unceasingly : his government bore throughout the bitter and hateful character of a partygovernment . With untiring jealousy he watched the secret opponents who still looked out for some movement from abroad , as a signal for fresh revolt : he kept diaries of their doings and conduct : it was said he availed himself of the confessional for this purpose : men whose names were from time to time // solemnly cursed at S. Paul 's on account of past treasons , so that they counted for open enemies , became useful to him as spies . If the decision lay between services received and suspicious conduct , the latter easily weighed down the balance , to the ruin of the victim . William Stanley , who had played the most important part in the battle which decided the fate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the realm after the King , had at the appearance of Perkin Warbeck ( who gave himself out as Edward 's younger son , Richard of York ) let slip the words , he would take his side , if he were the person he gave himself out to be . ' He had to atone for these words by his death , since he had intimated a doubt as to the King 's lawful right , which might mislead others into sedition . Gradually the movements ceased : the high nobility showed a loyal submission to the King : yet it did not attach itself to him , it let him and his government alone . The King 's principle was , to execute the laws most strictly , yet he was not cruel by nature ; if men implored his mercy , he was ready to grant it . The contracted position of a sovereign , who maintains his authority with the utmost strictness , does not however exclude a paternal care for the country . Henry clipped his people 's wings , to accustom them to obedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We find even that he made out a sketch of how the land should be cultivated so that every man might be able to live . The people did not love him , but it did not exactly hate him either : this was quite enough for Henry VII . A slight man , somewhat tall , with thin light-coloured hair , whose countenance bore the traces of the storms he had passed through ; in his appearance he gave the impression of being a high ecclesiastic rather than a chivalrous King . He was in this almost the exact opposite of Edward IV . He too certainly arranged public festivities and spared no expense to make them splendid , since his dignity demanded it , but his soul took no pleasure in them , he left them as soon as ever he could ; he lived only in business . In his council sat men of mark , sagacious bishops , experienced generals , magistrates learned in the law : he held it to be his duty // and his interest to hear their advice . And they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restrain his self-seeking will . But the main affairs he kept in his own hands . All that he undertook he conducted with great foresight and as a rule he carried it through . Foreigners regarded him as cunning and deceitful ; to his own people his successful prudence seemed to have something supernatural about it . If he had personal passions , he knew how to keep them under ; he seemed always calm and sober , sparing of words and yet affable . He directed almost his chief energies to this object , to keep off all foreign influences from his well-ordered kingdom . CHAPTER II . CHANGES IN THE CONDITION OF EUROPE . FOR the history of the world the decisive event of the epoch was the rapid rise of the French monarchy , which after it had freed itself from the English invasions , became master of all the hitherto separate territories of the great vassals , and lastly even of Brittany , and rapidly began to make its preponderance felt on all sides . Considered in itself no one would have been more called on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even still bore the title of King of France . In fact Henry did once revive his claim on the French crown , on Normandy and Guyenne , and took part in a coalition , which was to have forced Charles VIII to give up Brittany ; he crossed to Calais and threatened Boulogne . But he was not in earnest with these comprehensive views in his military enterprise , any more than Edward IV had once been in a similar one . Henry VII was contented when a considerable money payment year by year was secured to him , as it had been to Edward . The English called it a tribute , the French a pension . It was acceptable to the King , and advantageous for his home affairs , just at that moment ? 1492 ? to have a sum of money at his free disposal . And no one could have advised him to attach himself unconditionally to the house of Burgundy . Duke Charles ' widow was still alive , who found it unendurable that the house of York , from which she sprang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the seven nations of the world ' ? for so she expressed herself . With her the fugitive partisans of the house of York found refuge and protection : by 11. 2 . CHANGES IN THE CONDITION OF EUROPE . 105 herself and her son-in-law Maximilian of Austria the pretenders were fitted out who contested the crown with Henry VII . Henry could not really wish Brittany to pass to his sworn foe , so that he might be threatened from this quarter also at every moment . For how could he delude himself with the hope that a transitory alliance would prevail over a dynastic antipathy ? At this crisis Ferdinand the Catholic of Spain offered him an alliance and connexion by marriage . That which induced this sovereign to do so was above all Charles VIII 's invasion of Italy , and his conquest of Naples , to which the crown of Aragon had just claims . His plan was to oppose to the mighty consolidated power of France a family alliance with the Austro-Burgundian House , with Portugal , above all with England : he hoped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the most powerful party . Ferdinand offered the King of England a marriage between his youngest daughter Catharine and the Prince of Wales . In the English Privy Council many objections were made to this ; they did not wish to draw the enmity of France on themselves and would have rather seen the prince united to a princess of the house of Bourbon , as was then proposed . It was on Henry VIPs own responsibility that the offer was accepted . In September 1496 an agreement was come to about the conditions : on 15th August 1497 the ceremony of betrothal took place in the palace at Woodstock 1 . The motive which impelled Henry to his decision is sufficiently clear ; it was his relation to Scotland , on which the Spaniards already exercised influence . There the second pretender , Perkin Warbeck , had found a warm reception from the young and chivalrous James IV : he there married a lady of one of the chief houses : accompanied in person by this sovereign he made an attempt to invade England , which only failed owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . The Spanish ambassador Pedro de Ayala then out of regard to Henry secured Perkin 's withdrawal from Scotland . But in 1497 the danger revived in a yet greater degree . Warbeck landed in Cornwall where all the inhabitants rallied round him , and a revolt already once suppressed broke out again ; at this moment James IV , urged on by the nobles of the land , crossed the border with a splendid army : the cooperation of the two movements might have placed the King in a serious difficulty . Again it was the Spanish ambassador who made James IV determine not to let himself be urged on further ; but rather to give him the commission , to adjust his differences with England . Henry VII was set free to suppress the revolt in Cornwall ; Perkin Warbeck was taken in his flight . As the object of the Spaniards was to sever Scotland from her old alliance with France , and that too by means of a family alliance , it was an essential point in their mediation that Henry VII , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly betroth his daughter Margaret to James IV . The understanding with Spain and that with Scotland went hand in hand . And on another side too the alliance with Spain was very useful to the King of England . Ferdinand had married his elder daughter Juana to Maximilian 's son the Archduke Philip : Philip could not possibly uphold the Yorkist interests so zealously as his father or his grandmother . It was an event of importance that at Whitsuntide 1500 a meeting took place between the English and the Austro-Burgundian Court in the neighbourhood of Calais . Henry applied himself to win over those whom he knew to be his enemies : but at the same time he wished it to be remarked that the Archduke showed him the honour which belongs to a lawful King . If there were still Yorkist partisans in England , who placed their hopes in the house of Burgundy , they would find that they had nothing more to hope from that quarter . So the Spanish alliance served the prudent and circumspect politician , to secure him from any hostile action on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1501 came to England for her marriage , she was received with n. 2 . CONDITION OF EUROPE . I07 additional joy because it was felt that her near connexion with the Burgundian house promised good relations with the Netherlands 1 . But never was a more eventful marriage concluded . We do not know whether the Prince of Wales had really consummated it when he died before he was yet sixteen . But the two fathers were so well satisfied with an alliance which increased the security of the one and gained the other great consideration in the world , that they could not bring themselves to give up the family connexion , by which it was so much strengthened . The thought occurred to Ferdinand ? a very unusual one in the rest of the European world , though not indeed in Spain ? of marrying the Infanta to Henry , brother of the deceased prince , who was now recognised as Prince of Wales . With his condolence for the loss he united a proposal for the new marriage . In England from the beginning men did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which ought not to be contested from any side , the matter had its delicate points . The solution which Henry found shows clearly enough the natural tactics of the old politician . He obtained from the Roman Court a dispensation for the new marriage , which expressly included the case of the first marriage having been consummated . But it almost appears as though he did not fully trust this authorisation . High as the prestige of the supreme Pontiff still stood in the world , there were yet cases in which canonists and theologians doubted as to his dispensing power ; men could not possibly have forgotten that , when Richard III wished to marry his niece Elizabeth , a number of doctors disapproved of such a marriage , even if the Pope should sanction it . At any rate Henry VII instigated , or at least did not oppose , his son 's solemnly entering a protest , after the marriage ceremony between him and Catharine was performed , against its validity ( on the ground of his being too young ) , the evening before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN 1 ' 11E the presence of the Bishop of Winchester , his father 's chief Secretary of State . Hence all remained undecided . Catharine lived on in England : her dowry did not need to be given up ; the general influence of the political union was saved ; it could however be dissolved at any moment , and there was therefore no quarrel on this account with France , whence from time to time proposals proceeded for a marriage in the opposite interest . The prince kept himself quite free , to make use of the dispensation or not . For the King himself too , whose wife died in 1503 , many negociations were entered into on both sides . The French offered him a lady of the house of Angouleme ; he preferred Maximilian 's daughter , Margaret of Austria , not indeed for her personal qualities , however praiseworthy they might be ; he stipulated after his usual fashion for the surrender of the fugitive Edmund de la Pole , Earl of Suffolk , who was regarded as the chief representative of the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had at that time found a refuge in the Netherlands . Philip , who after the death of his mother-inlaw wished to take possession of his wife 's kingdoms in Spain , was on his voyage from Flanders driven by a storm on the English coasts : he was Henry 's guest at Windsor , Richmond , and London . Here then the King 's marriage with Philip 's sister was concerted , and with it the surrender of Suffolk . Philip strove long against this : when he yielded , he at least got a promise that Henry VII would spare the life of the earl , whom he accused of treason . He kept his word : the prisoner was not executed till after his death . Margaret had no inclination to wed herself with the harsh and self-seeking King , who was growing old : he himself , when Philip shortly after his arrival in Castile was snatched away by an early death , formed the idea of marrying his widow Juana , though she was no longer in her right mind . He opened a negotiation about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Spaniards ascribe to him the project of marrying himself to Ferdinand 's elder daughter , and his son to the younger , and making the latter marriage , which he was purposely always putting off , the price of his own . One should hardly ascribe such a folly to the prudent // and wise sovereign at his years and with his failing strength . That he made the proposals admits of no doubt : but we must suppose that he wished purposely to oppose to the pressure of the Spaniards for the marriage of his son with the Infanta a demand which they could never grant . For how could they let the King of England share in Juana 's immense claims of inheritance ? Henry wished neither to break off nor to complete his son 's marriage ; for the one course would have made Spain hostile , while the second might have produced a quarrel with France . Between these two powers he maintained an independent position , without however mixing in earnest with their affairs , and only with the view of warding off their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political relations were , as he said , to draw a brazen wall round England , within which he had gradually become complete lord and master . The crown he had won on the battlefield , and maintained as his own in the extremest dangers , he bequeathed to his son as an undoubted possession . The son succeeded the father without opposition , without a rival ? a thing that had not happened for centuries . Ile had only to ascend the throne , in order to take the reins of government into his hand . Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey in their earlier years . But that the political situation should continue as it was could not be expected . What has not seldom in the history of great kingdoms and states formed a decisive turning point now came to pass : to the father who had founded and maintained his power with foresight and by painful and continuous labour , succeeded a son full of life and energy , who wished to enjoy its possession , and feeling ' firm ground under his feet determined to live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too felt the need of being popular , like most princes on their accession : he sacrificed the two chiefs of the ifiscal commission , Empson and Dudley , to the universal to CHANGES IN THE hate . In general his father 's point of view seemed to him too narrow-hearted , his proceedings too cautious . The first great question which was laid before him concerned his marriage : he decided for it without further delay . No doubt that in this political reasons came chiefly into account . France had been ever growing mightier , it had just then struck down the republic of Venice by a great victory ; men thought it would one day or another come into collision with England , and held it prudent to unite themselves beforehand with those who could then be useful as allies . At that time this applied to the Spaniards above all others I. Yet , unless everything deceives us , political considerations only coincided with the prince 's inclinations . The Infanta was in the full bloom of her age ; the prince , was even younger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any association with her , might well be impressed by her : besides she had known how to conduct herself with tact and dignity in her difficult position ; with a blameless earnest mien she combined gentleness and loveable qualities . The marriage was carried out without delay ; in the ceremonies of her husband 's coronation Catharine could actually take part as Queen . How fully did these festivities again breathe the ancient character of chivalrous splendour . Men saw the King 's champion , with his own herald in front , in full armour , ride into the hall on his warsteed which carried the armorial bearings of England and France ; he challenged to single combat any one who would dare to say that Henry VIII was not the true heir of this realm ; then he asked the King for a draught of wine , who had it given him in a golden cup : the cup was then his own . Henry VIII had a double reason for confidence on his throne the blood of the house of York also flowed in his veins . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign influences , he wished to take part in them like his ancestors with the whole power of England . After CONDITION OF EUROPE . r 1 c the dangers which had been overcome had passed out of the memory of those living , the old delight in war awoke again . When France now began to encounter resistance in her career of victory , first through Pope Julius II , then through King Ferdinand , Henry did not hesitate to make common cause with them . It marks his disposition in these first years , that he took arms especially because men ought not to allow the supreme Priest of Christendom to be oppressed 1 . When King Louis and the Emperor Maximilian tried to oppose a Council to the Pope , Henry VIII dissuaded the latter from it with a zeal full of unction . He drew him over in fact to his side : they undertook a combined campaign against France in which they won a battle in the open field , and conquered a great city , Tournay . Aided by the English army Ferdinand the Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him by the Pope as being taken when it was in league with an enemy of the Church . Louis 's other ally , the Scottish King James IV , succumbed to the military strength of North England at Flodden , and Ilenry might have raised a claim to Scotland , like that of Ferdinand to Navarre : but he preferred , as his sister Margaret became regent there , to strengthen the indirect influence of England over Scotland . On the whole the advantages of his warlike enterprises were for England small , but not unimportant for the general relations of Europe . The predominance of France was broken : a freer position restored to the Papacy . Henry VIII felt himself fortunate in the full weight of the influence which England had won over European affairs . It was no contradiction of the fundamental ideas of English policy , when Henry VIII again formed a connexion with Louis XII , who was now no longer formidable . He even gave him his younger sister to wife , and concluded a treaty with him , by which he secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often done before . Yet he did not for this break at all with Ferdinand the Catholic , though // he had reason to complain of him : rather he concluded a new alliance with him , only in a less close and binding manner . He would not have endured that the successor of Louis XII ( who died immediately after his marriage ) , the youthful and warlike Francis I , after he had possessed himself of Milan , should have also advanced to Naples . For a moment , in consequence of these apprehensions , their relations became less close : but when the alarm proved to be unfounded , the alliance was renewed , and even Tournay restored for a compensation in money . Many personal motives may have contributed to this , but on the whole there was sense and system in such a policy . The reconquest of Milan did not make the King of France so strong that he would become dangerous , particularly as on the other side the monarchy which had been prepared by the Spanish-Netherlands ' connexions now came into existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish kingdoms with Naples and the lordship over the Netherlands . To this position between the two powers it would have lent new weight and great splendour if the German princes could have been induced to transfer to the King of England the peaceful dignity of a Roman-German Emperor . He bestirred himself about this for a moment , but did not feel it much when it was refused him . But now since the empire too was added to the possessions in Spain , Italy , and the Netherlands , and hence redoubled jealousy awakened in King Francis I , which held out an immediate prospect of war , the old question came up again before King Henry , which side England was to take between them , and that in a more pressing form than ever . A special complication arose from the fact that yet another person with separate points of view now took part in the politics of the age . In another point Henry VIII departed from his father 's tactics and habits ; he no longer sat so regularly with his Privy Council and deliberated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best secure himself against prejudicial results from the discords that reigned among them , by taking affairs // more into his own hand . A young ecclesiastic , his Almoner Thomas Wolsey , had then gained the greatest influence over him ; he had been introduced alike into business and into intimacy with . the King by Fox , Bishop of Winchester , who wished to oppose a more youthful ability to his rivals in the Privy Council . In both relations Wolsey was completely successful . It stood him in good stead that another favourite , Charles Brandon , Duke of Suffolk , who had married Henry 's sister ( Louis XII 's widow ) , and was the King 's cornrack in knightly exercises and the external show of court-life , for a long time remained in intimate friendship with him . Wolsey was conversant with the scholastic philosophy , with Saint Thomas Aquinas ; but that did not hinder him from cooperating also in the revival of classical studies , which were just coming into notice at Oxford : he had a feeling for the efforts of Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inborn talent for architecture , to which we owe some wonderful works 1 . The King too loved building ; the present of a skilfully cut jewel could delight I him ; and he sought honour in defending the scholastic dogmas against Luther 's views ; in all this Wolsey seconded and supported him , he combined state-business with conversation . He freed the King from the consultations of the Privy Council , in which the intrinsic importance of the matter always weighs more than one 's own will ; Henry VIII first felt himself to be really King when business was managed by a favourite thoroughly dependent on him , trusted by him , and in fact very capable . Wolsey showed the most manysided activity and an indefatigable power of work . He presided in court though he was not strong in law ; he mastered e department of finance ; the King named him Archbishop f York , the Pope Cardinal-Legate , so that the whole control of ecclesiastical matters fell into his hands ; foreign affairs were peculiarly his own department . We have a considerable number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us an idea of the characteristics of his mind . Very circumstantially and almost wearisomely do they advance ? not exactly in a straight line ? weighing manifold possibilities , multiplied reasons : they are scholastic in form , in contents sometimes fantastic even to excess , intricate yet acute , flattering to the person to whom they are addressed , but withal filled with a surprising self-consciousness of power and talent . Wolsey is celebrated by Erasmus for his affability , and to a great scholar he may have been accessible , but to others he was not so . When he went to walk in the park of Hampton Court , no one would have dared to come within a long distance of him . When questions were asked him he reserved to himself the option of answering or not . He had a way of giving his opinion so that every man yielded to him ; especially as the possession of the King 's favour , which he enjoyed , made it impossible to oppose him . If the government was spoken of , he was wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , ' or at last I. ' Just because he was of humble origin , he wished to shine by splendid appearance , costly and rare furniture , unwonted expenditure . Early one morning his appointment as Cardinal arrived , that same morning at mass he displayed the insignia of his new dignity . He required outward tokens of reverence , and insisted on being served on bended knee . He had many other passions , of which the chief was ecclesiastical ambition pervaded by personal vanity . It gave him high satisfaction that both the great powers emulously courted the favour and friendship of his King , of which he seemed to have the disposal . In June 1520 took place within the English possessions on French soil the meeting between Henry VIII and Francis I , which is well designated as the Field of the Cloth of Gold . It was properly a great tournament , proclaimed in both nations , to which the chief lords yet once more gathered in all their splendour . With the festivities were mingled negociations in which the Cardinal of York played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just afterwards on the continent , Henry VIII met Charles V also , with less // show but greater intimacy ; the negociations here took the opposite direction . In 1521 , when war had already broken out between the two great powers , the cardinal in his King 's name undertook the part of mediator . There in Calais he sat to a certain degree in judgment on the European powers . The plenipotentiaries of both sovereigns laid their cases before him : with apparent zeal and much bustle he tried at least to conclude a truce : he complained once of the Emperor , that he disregarded his good advice though weighty and to the point : on which the latter did come a step nearer him . It was a magnificent position if he understood and maintained it . The more powerful both princes became , the more dangerous to the world their enmity should be , the more need there was of a mediating authority between them . But the purity of intention which is required to carry out such a task is seldom given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition suggested plans to him which reached far beyond a peace arbitration . When he promoted that first interview with Francis I against the will of the great men and of the Queen of England , the Emperor 's ambassadors , who were thrown into consternation by it , remarked that the French King must have promised him the Papacy , which however , they add , is rather in the Imperial than in the royal gift It does not appear that the Emperor went quite so far at once , he only warned the cardinal against the untrustworthy promises of the French , and sought to bring him to the conviction ? while making him the most advantageous offers ? that he could expect everything from him ' . Clear details he reserved till they met in person ; and then he in fact drew him over completely to his side . Under Wolsey 's influence King Henry , immediately on the outbreak of the war , gave out his intention of making common cause with the Emperor . For he had not , he said , so little understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // him of carrying out his predecessors ' claims and his own , and he wished to use it . Only he preferred not to commence war at once , since he was not yet armed , and since a broader alliance should be first formed . The cardinal hoped to be able to draw the Pope , the Swiss , and the Duke of Savoy , as well as the Kings of Portugal , Denmark , and Hungary , into it . What an impression then it must have made on him , when Pope Leo X , without being pressed , at once allied himself with the Emperor ! Wolsey 's attempt at mediation ? no room for doubt about it is left by the documents that lie before us ? was only meant as a means of gaining time . At Calais Wolsey had already given the imperial ambassadors , in the presence of the Papal Nuncio , the most definite assurances as to the resolution of his King to take part in the war against France . Before he returned to England to call the Parliament together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he visited the Emperor at Bruges . At the last negotiations , being at times doubtful about his trustworthiness , Charles V held it doubly necessary to bind him by every tie to himself . He then spoke to him of the Papacy , and gave him his word that he would advance him to that dignity 1 . The opportunity for this came almost too soon . When Leo X died , just at this moment , Wolsey 's hopes rose in stormy impatience . When the Emperor renewed his assurance to him , he demanded of him in plain terms to advance his then victorious troops to Rome , and put down by main force any resistance to the choice proposed . Before anything could be done , before the ambassador whom Henry VIII despatched at once to Italy reached it , the cardinals had already elected , and elected moreover the Emperor 's former tutor , Hadrian . But was not this a proof of his irresistible authority ? Hadrian 's advanced age made it clear that there would be an early vacancy : and to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would administer the Papacy for the sole advantage of the King and // the Emperor : he thought then to overpower the French , and after completing this work he already saw himself in spirit directing his weapons to the East , to put an end to the Turkish rule . At his second visit to England the Emperor renewed his promise at Windsor castle ; he spoke of it in his conferences with the King ' . Altogether the closest alliance was concluded . The Emperor promised to marry Henry 's daughter Mary , assuming that the Pope would grant him the necessary dispensation . Their claims to French territories they would carry out by a combined war . Should a difficulty occur between them , Cardinal Wolsey was fixed on as umpire . So did the alliance between the houses of Burgundy and Tudor come to pass , the basis of which was to be the annihilation of the power of the Valois , and into which the English minister threw his world-wide ambition . From England also a declaration of war now reached Francis I. Whilst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most successful progress , the English , in 1522 under Howard Earl of Surrey , in 1523 under Brandon Earl of Suffolk , both times in combination with Imperial troops , invaded France on the side of the Netherlands , invasions which , to say the least , very much hampered the French . Movements also manifested themselves within France itself , which awoke hopes in the King that he might make himself master of the French crown as easily as his father had once done of the English . Leo X had already been persuaded to absolve the subjects of Francis I from their oaths to him . It ? was in connexion with this that the second man in France , the Constable of Bourbon , slighted in his station , And endangered in his possessions , resolved to help himself by revolting from Francis I. He wished then to recognise no other King in France but Henry VIII : at a solemn moment , after receiving the sacrament , he communicated to the English ambassador , who was with him , his resolution to set the French crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHANGES IN THE 11. 2. reckoned on a numerous party declaring for him . And in the autumn of 1523 it looked as if this project would be accom , plished . Suffolk and Egmont pressed on to Montdidier without meeting with any resistance : it was thought that the Netherland and English forces would soon occupy the capital , and give a new form to the realm . Pope Hadrian was just dead at Rome ; would not the united efforts of the Emperor and the King of England succeed , by their influence on the conclave , especially now that they were victorious , in really raising Wolsey to the tiara ? This however did not happen . In Rome not Wolsey but Julius Medici was elected Pope ; the combined Netherland and English troops retreated from Montdidier ; Bourbon saw himself discovered and had to fly , no one declared for him . This last is doubtless to be ascribed to the vigilance and good conduct of King Francis , but in the retreat of the troops and in the election of the Pope other causes were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act with as much energy for Wolsey as the latter expected : Wolsey never forgave him . But he too has been accused of having basely abused the confidence of the two sovereigns : he had kept up friendly connexions all along with Francis I and his mother , and they likewise had given him pensions and presents : he had purposely supported the Earl of Suffolk so ill that he was forced to retreat ' . Of all the complaints raised against him , not so much before the world as among those who were behind the scenes , this was exactly the most hateful and perhaps the most effectual . In 1524 the English took no active part in the war . Not till February 1525 , when the German and Spanish troops had won the great victory of Pavia and King Francis had fallen captive into the Emperor 's hands , did their ambitious projects and thoughts of war reawaken . Henry VIII reminded the Emperor of his previous promises , // and invited him to make a joint attack on France itself from both sides : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be crowned King of France , but resign to the Emperor not merely Burgundy but also Provence and Languedoc , and cede to the Duke of Bourbon his old possessions and Dauphin6 . The motive he alleges is very extraordinary : the Emperor would marry his daughter and heiress , and would at some future time inherit England and France also and then be monarch of the world 1 . Henry declares himself ready to press on with the utmost zeal , provided he can do it with some security , and himself undertake the conduct of the war in the Netherlands and the support of Bourbon . The letter is from Wolsey , full of copious and pressing conclusions ; but should not the far-reaching nature of its contents have been a proof even to him that it could never be taken in earnest ? Charles V could not possibly enter into the plan . He had lent it a hearing as long as it lay far away , but when it came actually close to view , it was very startling for him . The union of the crowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would in itself have deranged all European relations , above all it would have raised that untrustworthy nlan , who was still all powerful in his Council , to a most inconvenient height of power . The Spanish kingdoms too were pressing for the settlement of their succession . He was in the full maturity of manly youth : he could not wait for Mary of England who had barely completed her tenth year : he resolved to break off this connexion , and give his hand to a Portuguese princess , who was nearly of his own age . It could not be otherwise but that to the closest union , which was broken at the moment when it might well have been able to attain its object , the bitterest discord should succeed . CHAPTER III . ORIGIN OF THE DIVORCE QUESTION . PERHAPS it is not a matter of such very great weight whether the Emperor did his best for Wolsey in the conclave , or Wolsey his best for the Emperor in the campaign of 1523 . That the result did not correspond to the expectations on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What could the Emperor do with an English minister who was not in a condition to support warlike enterprises properly ? what could the English do with an ally who appropriated to himself exclusively the advantages of the victory they had won ? Henry VIII , while trying to win the French crown , had only weakened it , and thereby given the house of Burgundy a preponderance in European affairs , by which all other powers , and himself as well , felt themselves threatened . After the battle of Pavia a feeling prevailed throughout the world that the rule of Spain and Burgundy would be intolerable , if France were no longer independent . The ministers of the Pope in Rome first came to a consciousness of this : as the best means of restoring the balance , they looked to the dissolution of the alliance between Henry VIII and Charles V. The Pope 's Datary , Giberti , made approaches to the English Court , though still with timid caution , in order in the first place only to propose a reconciliation between England and France ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cardinal Wolsey were more inclined to this plan than he had expected . If not before yet certainly since his alienation from the Emperor , the cardinal had entered into secret negociations with the mother of the King of France : the last proposals to the Emperor had been only an attempt to turn the success of his arms to the advantage of England also : when he rejected them , the cardinal entered into the French connexion with increased zeal . Before the end of the summer of 1523 peace between England and France was effected with the sympathizing co-operation of Rome . In it the Regent Louise accepted the conditions laid down by the cardinal : she did not neglect to secure him by a considerable pension . From the beginning she had on her side also tried to excite his world-wide ambition ; for Francis I and Henry VIII , if once they became friends , would do noble deeds to their own . undying renown and to the glory of God , and the direction of their enterprises would fall to the cardinal 1 . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper hand . He extorted the Peace of Madrid ; the League of the Italian princes with France , by which its execution was to have been hindered , and to which England lent her moral support without actually joining it , led Charles V to new victories , to the conquest of Rome , and hence to a position in the world which now did really threaten the freedom of all other nations . The necessary result was that France and England drew still more closely together . Cardinal Wolsey appeared in France ; a close alliance was concluded and ( not without considerable English help ) an army sent into the field , which in fact gained the upper hand in Italy and restored to the Pope , who had escaped to Orvieto , some feeling of independence . Soon the largest projects were formed on this side also , in which the two Kings expected to have the Pope entirely with them . The French declared their wish to conquer Naples and never restore it to the // Emperor , not even under the most favourable conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Emperor in Naples and even in the Empire , for which certain German electors could be won over ; he boasted that he would bring about such a revolution as had not been seen for a century . It was at this crisis in the general situation , and when an attempt was being made to direct politics towards the annihilation of the Emperor , that the thought occurred of dissolving Henry VIII 's marriage with the Emperor 's aunt , the Infanta Catharine . It is very possible , as a contemporary tradition informs us , that Wolsey was instigated to this by personal feelings . His arrogant and wanton proceedings , offensive by their excesses , and withal showing all the priestly love of power , were hateful to the inmost soul of the pure and earnest Queen . She is said to have once reproached him with them , and to have even repelled his unbecoming behaviour with a threatening word , and he on his part to have sworn to overthrow her t . But this personal motive first became permanently important when joined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means so entirely shut out from the events of the day as has been asserted ; in moments of difficulty we find her summoning the members of the Privy Council before her to discuss the pending questions with them . When Wolsey began a life and death struggle with the Emperor , the influence of the Queen , whose most lively sympathies were with her nephew , stood not a little in his way ; it was his chief interest to remove her . It was indeed the feeling of the time , that family unions and political alliances must go hand in hand . At the very first proposal for a reconciliation between England and France , Giberti had advised the marriage of the English princess Mary , who had been rejected by the Emperor , with a French prince , and there had been much negociation about it . But // owing to the extreme youth of the princess it was soon felt that this would not lead to the desired end . If a definitive rupture was to take place between England and the Burgundo-Spanish power , Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus made for a French princess . This marriage however was itself the result of that former state of politics which had led to the first war with France . Wolsey formed the plan of marrying his King , in Catharine 's stead , with the sister or even with the daughter of Francis I who was now growing up 1 : then only would the alliance between the two powers become indissoluble . When he was in France in 1527 , he said to the Regent , the King 's mother , that within a year she would live to see two things , the most complete separation of his sovereign from Spain , and his indissoluble union with France 2 . But to these motives of foreign policy was now added an extremely important reason of home policy : this lay in the precarious state of the Succession . When the King several years before was congratulated on the birth of his daughter , with an intimation that the birth of a son might have been still more acceptable , he replied quickly , they were both still young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have a son ? But gradually this hope had ceased , and as hitherto no Queen had ever reigned in her own right in England , the opinion gained ground that at the King 's death the throne would fall vacant . It had a little before created a party among the people for the Duke of Buckingham , when he maintained that he was the nearest heir to the crown , and would not let it be taken from him . He had been executed for this : Mary 's right to the succession met with no further opposition ; but even so it was still always a doubtful future that lay before the country . People wished to marry Mary at one time to the Emperor , at another to the King or a prince of I24 ORIGIN OF THE II . 3 . France : so that her claim to the inheritance of the crown should pass to the house of Burgundy or to that of Valois . But how dangerous this was for the independence of the country ! Henry would surely not have lost himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heir , to represent the independent interests of England . In other times relations of this kind would have probably been reckoned as in themselves sufficient reason for a divorce : but not so in that age . The very essence of marriage lies in this , that it raises the union , on which the family and the order of the world rests , above the momentary variations of the will and the inclination ; by the sanction of the Church it becomes one of that series of religious institutions which set limits on every side to individual caprice . No one yet dared so far to deny the religious character of marriage , as to have avowed mere political views in wishing for a separation , either before the world , or even to himself . But now there was no want of spiritual reasons which might be brought forward for it . The King 's own confessor revived the doubts in him which had once been raised before his marriage with his brother 's widow . And when the King was then reminded that such a marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threatened with the punishment of childlessness , how could it fail to make an impression on him , when this threat seemed to be strictly fulfilled in his case ? Two boys had been born to him from this marriage , but both had died soon after their birth . Even within the Catholic Church it had been always a moot point whether the Pope could dispense with a law of Scripture . The divine punishment inflicted on the King , as he thought , seemed to prove that the Pope 's dispensation ( encroaching as it did on the region of the divine power ) , on the strength of which the marriage had been concluded , had not the validity ascribed to it . Scruples of this sort can not be said to be a mere pretence ; they have something of the half belief , half superstition , so peculiarly characteristic of the spirit of the age and of that of the King . And none could yet foresee what results they implicitly involved . It still appeared possible that the Pope would revoke the // dispensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds of invalidity could be found in the bull itself . Wolsey 's idea was that the Pope , in the pressing necessity he was under of ranging England and France against the pre-ponderance of the Emperor , could be brought to consent to recall the dispensation , and this would make the marriage null and void from the beginning . Always full of arrogant assumption of an influence to which nothing could be im-possible , Wolsey assured the King that he would carry the matter through ' . When tidings of this proposal first reached Rome , those immediately around the Pope took special notice of the political advantages that might accrue from it . For hitherto there was a doubt whether Henry VIII was really so de-cidedly in favour of France as was said : a project like this , which would make him and the Emperor enemies for ever , left no room for doubt about it . When the Pope saw him-self secure of this support in reserve , his word , in a matter which concerned the highest personal and civil interests , ac-quired new weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pope at first expressed himself favourably . It appeared to make an especial impression on him , that the want of a male heir might cause a civil war in England , and that this must be disadvantageous to the Church as well3 . He only asked not to be pressed as long as he was in danger of experiencing the worst extremities from the over-whelming power of the Emperor . In the spring of 1528 , when the French army advanced victoriously into the Neapolitan territory and drove back the Emperor 's forces to the capital , Wolsey 's request for full powers to inquire into the affair in England was taken into earnest consideration by the Pope . // It was at Orvieto , in the Pope 's working room , which was also his sleeping-chamber : a couple of cardinals , the Dean of the Roman Rota , and the English plenipotentiaries sat round the Pope , to talk over the case thoroughly . One of the cardinals declared himself against the Commission demanded by Wolsey , since such a grant contravened the usage of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in a matter concerning a King who had done such service to the Holy See , they might well deviate from the usual forms ; he actually delegated this Commission to Cardinal Campeggi , whom the English esteemed as their friend , and to Wolsey . By this nothing was yet effected : it even appears as though Clement VII had given tranquillising promises to the Emperor ; the Bishop of Bayonne declared that the Pope 's intention was thus to keep both sides dependent on him ? but it was at all events one step on the road once taken , which aroused hope in England that it would lead to the desired end . But let us picture to ourselves the enormous difficulty of the case . It lay above all in the inner significance of the question itself . In his first interview with Henry VIII Campeggi remarks that the King was completely convinced of the invalidity of the Papal dispensation , which could not extend to Scripture precepts . No argument could move him from this ; he answered like a good theologian and jurist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him change his opinion . He could not but see that Wolsey cherished the same view . But was it possible for the Roman court to yield in this and to revoke a dispensation , which involved the very substance of its spiritual omnipotence ? It would have thus only strengthened , and in reality confessed , the antagonism against its authority which was based on Holy Scripture . Campeggi could not yield a hair 's breadth . The only solution lay ? and Campeggi was authorised to attempt it ? in inducing Queen Catharine to renounce her place and dignity . Soon after his arrival he represented to her at length how much depended on it for her and the world , and promised her that in return not only all else should be // secured to her that she could desire , but above all that the succession of her daughter also should be guaranteed . The wish , in which both Pope and King agreed , that she should enter a convent , Campeggi at first did not mention to her ; he thought she would herself seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spoken to her in the name of the Pope : she only said she thought to abide till death in obedience to the precepts of God and of the Church : she would ask for counsellors from the King , would consult with them , and then communicate to the Holy Father what her conscience bade her . Her consent still remained possible . This gained , the legate would have no need to mention further the validity or invalidity of the dispensation . He was still hoping for it , when Wolsey came to him one morning early ( 26 Oct. 1528 ) and told him the Queen had asked the King for leave to make her confession to him ( Campeggi ) , and had obtained it . A couple of hours later the Queen appeared before him . She told him of her earlier marriage , which was never really consummated ; that she had remained as unchanged by it as she had been from her mother 's womb ; and this destroyed all grounds for the divorce . Campeggi was however far from drawing such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vow and enter a convent , repeating the motives stated before , to which he now added the example of a Queen of France . But his words died away without effect . Queen Catharine declared positively that she would never act thus ; she was called by God to her marriage , and resolved to live and die in it . A judgment might be pronounced in this matter ; if the marriage was declared to be invalid , she would submit , she would then be as free as the King ; but without this she would hold fast to her marriage union . She protested , in the strongest terms conceivable , that they might kill her , they might tear her limb from limb , yet she would not change her mind ; had she two lives , she would lay them both down in such a cause . It would be better , she said , for the Pope to try to divert the King from his design ; he would then be able to trust all the more in the inclination of her kinsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In the presence of the counsellors given her at her wish , both legates repeated two days later in a formal audience their admonition to the Queen not to insist on a definite decision ; but already Campeggi had little hope left ; he was astonished that the lady , usually so prudent , should in the midst of peril so obstinately reject judicious advice I. The question between King and Queen was , we might say , also of a dogmatic nature . Had the Pope the right to dispense with the laws of Scripture or had he not ? The Queen accepted it as it had been accepted in recent times , especially as the presupposed conditions of a marriage had not been fulfilled in her case . The King rejected it under all circumstances , in agreement with scholars and the rising public opinion . But into this question various other general and personal reasons now intruded themselves . If the question were answered in the negative Wolsey held firmly to the view of forming an indissoluble union between France and England , of securing the succession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of restoring universal peace ; to this he added the project , as he once actually said in confidential discourse , of reforming the English laws , doubtless in an ecclesiastical and monarchic sense ; if he had once accomplished all this , he would retire , to serve God during the rest of his life . But he had already ( and a sense of it seems almost to be expressed in these last words so unlike his usual mode of thought ) ceased to be in agreement with his King . Henry VIII wished for the divorce , the establishment of his succession by male offspring , friendship with France , and Peace : but he did not care for the French marriage . He was some years younger than his wife , who inclined to the Spanish forms of strict devotion , and regarded as wasted the hours which she spent at her dressing table . Henry VIII was addicted to knightly exercises of arms , he loved pleasant company , music , and art ; we can not call him a gross voluptuary , but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural son ; he was ever entangled in new connexions of this kind . Many letters of his survive , in which a tincture of fancy and even of tenderness is coupled with a thorough sensuousness ; just in the fashion of the romances of chivalry which were then being first printed and were much read . At that time Anne Boleyn , a lady who had lately returned from France , and appeared from time to time at Court , saw him at her feet ; she was not exactly of ravishing beauty , but full of spirit and grace and with a certain reserve . While she resisted the King , she held him all the faster The reasons of home and foreign policy mentioned above , and even the religious scruples , have their weight ; but we can not shut our eyes to the fact that this new passion , nourished on the expectation of the divorce which was not unconditionally refused by the spiritual power , gave the strongest personal impulse to carry the affair through . The position of parties in the State also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great lords , and kept them down , and offended them by his pride , was heartily hated by them . Adorned though he was with the most brilliant honours of the Church , yet for the great men of the realm he was nothing but an upstart : they had never quite given up the hope of living to see his fall . But if he brought the French marriage to pass , as he designed , he would have won lasting support and have become stronger than ever . Besides the great men took the Burgundian side , not that they wished to make the Emperor lord of the world , but on the other hand they did not want a war with him : merchants and farmers saw that a war with the Netherlands , where they sold their wool , would be an injury to all . When Wolsey flattered the Pope with the hope of an attack on the Netherlands , he was , the Bishop of Bayonne assures us , the only man in the country who thought of it . He felt keenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of the efforts and devices he would have need of , to maintain himself . It was therefore just what the nobles wanted , that Wolsey fell out with the King in a matter of such engrossing nature , and that they found another means of access to him . The Boleyns were not of noble origin , but had been for some time connected with the leading families . Geoffrey the founder of the house had raised himself by success in business and good conduct to the dignity of Lord Mayor of London . His son William married the daughter of the only Irish peer who had a seat and vote in the English Parliament , Sir Thomas Ormond de Rochefort , Earl of Wiltshire . His titles passed through his daughter to his grandsons , of whom one , Thomas Boleyn , was created Viscount Rochefort , and married the daughter of the Duke of Norfolk ; his daughter was Anne Boleyn : she took high rank and an especially distinguished position in English society because her uncle , Thomas Duke of Norfolk , was Henry VIII 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasurer ) and was at the same time the leading man of the nobility . He had the reputation of being versed in business , cultivated , and shrewd ; he was Wolsey 's natural opponent . That the King showed an inclination to his niece , against the cardinal 's views , was for him and his friends a great point gained ' . It was soon seen that Anne 's influence had obtained the recall of an opponent of Wolsey , who had insulted him and was banished from the Court 2 . It was of the greatest importance for home affairs , that the King was inclined to make Anne Boleyn his wife . The English kings in general did not think marriages in their own rank essential . Henry 's own grandfather , Edward IV , had married a lady of by no means distinguished origin . It was seen beforehand that , if this happened , Wolsey could not maintain himself , and authority would again fall into the hands of the chief families . Even the cardinal 's old // friend , the Earl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nobility sided with it . But besides this the chief foreign affairs took a turn which made it impossible to carry out Wolsey 's political ideas . In the summer of 15,28 the attacks of the allies on Naples were repulsed , and their armies annihilated . In the spring of 1529 the Emperor got the upper hand in Lombardy also . How utterly then did the oft-proposed plan , of depriving him of the supreme dignity , sink into nothingness : he was stronger than ever in Italy . The Pope was fortunate in not having joined the allies more closely ; the relations of the States of the Church with Tuscany made a union with the Emperor necessary ; he had a horror of a new quarrel with him . And as the Emperor now took up the interests of his mother 's sister in the most earnest manner , and protested against proceeding by a Commission granted for England , the Pope could not possibly let the affair go on unchecked . When the English ambassadors pressed him , he exclaimed to them ( for apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King ) that he felt himself as it were between anvil and hammer . Divers proposals were made , one more extraordinary than the other , if only the King would give up his demand ' ; but this was no longer possible . The two cardinals , Campeggi and Wolsey , had to begin judicial proceedings : King and Queen appeared before the Court , Articles were put forward , witnesses heard : the Correspondence shows that the King and Anne Boleyn expected with much confidence a speedy and favourable decision 2 . Wolsey too did // not yet abandon this hope . It was thought at the time that he did not do all he might have done for it , that in fact he no longer favoured it , seeing as he did that it would turn out to the advantage of his rivals ' . But it was in truth his fate , that the consequences of the . design which originated with him recoiled on his own head . If it succeeded , it must be disadvantageous to him : if it failed , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to exert yet once more its whole influence with the Papal Court for this matter , sound like a cry of distress in extreme peril . He had only undertaken it to unite France and England ; the thing was reasonable and practicable , the Pope would not wish by refusing it to offend both crowns at once ; he would value it more highly than if he himself were raised to the Papacy . But he had now to find that King Francis , as well as Pope Clement , was seeking a separate peace with the Emperor . Wolsey had given Henry the strongest assurances on this point , that such a thing would never happen , France would never separate herself from him . But yet this now happened , and how could any influence from that quarter on the Roman Court be still expected in favour of England , in a matter which was so highly offensive to the Emperor ! The legates received from Rome distinct instructions to proceed slowly , and in no case to pronounce a decision 2 . While King Henry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( using the holidays of the Roman Rota as a pretence ) announced the suspension of their proceedings . It appeared in an instant into what a violent ebullition of wrath , which unsettled every thing , the King fell in consequence ; it seemed as if all his past way of governing had been a mistake . In contradiction to many of the older traditions of English history he had hitherto ruled chiefly through ecclesiastics to the disgu3t of the lay lords : now he // betook himself to the latter , to complain of the proceedings of the two cardinals . These were still in the hall where they had sat , when Suffolk and some other lords appeared , and bade them bring the matter to an end without delay , even if it were by a peremptory decree , that might be issued on the next day , on which the holidays would not have begun . But the prorogation was in fact only the form under which the cardinals fulfilled their orders from Rome ; they could not possibly recall it . Suffolk broke out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to England . The two spiritual lords looked at each other with amazement . Had they any feeling that his words contained a declaration of war on the part of the lay element in the State against ecclesiastical and foreign influences in general ? Wolsey , at any rate , could not shut his eyes to the significance of such a war . He often said that what Henry VIII took in hand he could not be brought to give up by any representations ; he had sometimes tried it , he had fallen at his feet , but it had been always in vain . Henry contained himself yet a while , as hopes had been given him that the proceedings might be resumed . But when a Breve came , by which Clement VII recalled his Commission and evoked the question of the divorce to Rome , he saw clearly that the influence of the Emperor in the Pope 's Council had quite gained the upper hand over his own on this point . He was resolved not to submit to it . Had he not , before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnity his resolution to carry through the divorce for the good of the land ? his passion and his ambition had joined hands for this purpose before the eyes of the country . To prevent the need of recoiling , he formed a plan of incalculable importance , the plan of separating his nation and his kingdom from the spiritual jurisdiction of the Roman See . CHAPTER IV . THE SEPARATION OF THE ENGLISH CHURCH . ALREADY at Orvieto Stephen Gardiner had told the Pope that , if the King did not obtain justice from him , he would do himself justice in his own kingdom . Later it was plainly declared to the Pope that , if they saw the Emperor had the ascendancy in his Council , the nobility of England with the King at their head would feel themselves compelled to cast off obedience to Rome . It seems as though the Roman Court however had no real fear of this . For the King , so they said , would do himself most damage by such a step ' . The Papal Nuncio declared himself positively convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply and forcibly , if one would gain their respect . But these tendencies were more deeply rooted among the English than was remembered at Rome . They went back as far as the Articles of Clarendon , the projects of King John , the antipapal agitation under Edward III ; the present question which involved an exceptionable and personal motive , exposed to public disapprobation , nevertheless touched on the deepest interests of the country . The wish to make the succession safe was perfectly justifiable . According to Clement VIPs own declarations , the English were convinced that he was only hindered by regard for the Emperor from coming to a decision which was essential to them . His vacillation is very intelligible , very natural : but it did not correspond to the idea of the dignity with which he was clothed . There was // to be an independent supreme Pontiff for this very reason , that right might be done in the quarrels of princes , without respect of persons , according to the state of the case . It clashed with the idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence as they did in this matter . There was indeed something degrading for the English in their being made to feel the reaction of the Emperor 's Italian victory , and his preponderance , in their weightiest affairs . Henry VIII had now made up his mind to throw off that ecclesiastical subjection , which was politically so disadvantageous ; the circumstances were very favourable . It was the time at which some German principalities , and the kingdoms of the North , had given themselves a constitution which rested on the exclusion of the hierarchic influences of Rome : the King could reckon on many allies in his enterprise . Moreover he had no dangerous hostilities to fear , as long as the jealousy lasted between the Emperor and King Francis . Between them Henry VIII needed only to revert to his natural policy of neutrality . And the accomplishment of the affair was already prepared in the country itself , through no one more than through Cardinal Wolsey . The dignity of legate , which was granted him by Pope Leo , and then prolonged for five , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him a comprehensive spiritual authority . He obtained by it the right of visiting and reforming all ecclesiastical persons and institutions , even those which possessed a legal exemption of their own . Some orders of monks , which contended against it , were reduced to obedience by new bulls . But from the visitation of the monasteries Wolsey proceeded to their suppression : he united old convents ( such as that one which has brought down to recent times the name of an Anglo-Saxon king 's daughter , Frideswitha , from the eighth century ) with the splendid colleges which he endowed so richly , for the advancement of learning and the renown of his name , at Oxford and at Ipswich . His courts included all branches of the ecclesiastical and mixed jurisdiction , and the King had no scruple in arming Lim with all the powers // of the crown which were necessary for the government of the Church . What aspirations then arose are shewn by the compact which Wolsey made with King Francis I to counteract the influence which the Emperor might exert over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that whatever the cardinal and the English prelates should enact with the King 's consent should have the force of law , does not this imply at least a temporary schism ? When Clement became free , he named Wolsey his VicarGeneral for the English Church : his position was again to be what it had been from the beginning , the expression of the unity between the Pope and the Crown . But now how if this were dissolved ? The victorious Emperor exercised a still greater influence over the Pope when free than he had ever done over him when captive . Under these circumstances Wolsey submitted to the supreme spiritual power , the King resolved to withstand it : it was exactly on this point that open discord broke . out between them . For a time the cardinal seemed still to maintain his courage ; but when on St. Luke 's day ? the phrase ran that the evangelist had disevangelised him ? the great seal was taken from him , he lost all self-reliance . Wolsey was not a Ximenes or a Richelieu . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this he fell back into his nothingness . He was heard to wail like a child : the King comforted him by a token of favour , probably however less out of personal sympathy than because he could not be yet quite dispensed with The High Treasurer , Norfolk , who generally acted as first minister , received the seals , and held them till some time afterwards Thomas More was named Chancellor . While these administered affairs in London , Suffolk , as President of the Privy Council , was to accompany the King in person . The chief direction of the administration passed over to the two leading lay lords . Henry VIII 's resolution to call the Parliament together was of almost greater importance for the progress of events than the alteration in the ministry . // During the fourteen years of his administration Wolsey had summoned Parliament only once , and that was when , in order to carry on the war in alliance with the Emperor against France , he needed an extraordinary grant of money . But his opening discourses were received with silence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the need of money more pressingly represented to a Parliament and never was there greater opposition ; after a fortnight 's consultation the proposal only passed at a moment when the members of the King 's household and court formed the majority of those present ' . The Parliament and the country always murmured at Wolsey 's oppressive and lavish finance management 2 ; a later attempt to raise taxes that had not been voted doubled the outcry against him . His fall and the convocation of a Parliament seemed a return to parliamentary principles in general , which in themselves exactly agreed with the view taken by the King in the present questions . In the first years of Henry VIII the Parliament had wished to do away with some of the most startling exemptions of the clergy from the temporal jurisdiction , for instance in reference to the crimes of felony and murder ; the ecclesiastics had on the other hand extended their jurisdiction yet further , even to cases that had reference solely to questions of property . Hence the antagonism between the two jurisdictions had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticeable that the temporal claims were upheld by a learned Minorite , Henry Standish , who declared it to be quite lawful to limit the ecclesiastical privileges for the sake of the public good ; especially in the case of a crime that did not properly come before any spiritual court . Both sides then applied to the King : the ecclesiastics reminded him that he ought i38 SEPARATION OF THE If . 4. to uphold the rights of Holy Church , the laymen that he should maintain the powers of jurisdiction belonging to the crown . The King 's declaration was favourable to the laymen ; he recommended the clergy to acquiesce in some exceptions from their decretals . But the contest was rather suspended than decided . Wolsey 's government followed , in which the spiritual courts extended their powers still further , and in reality exercised an offensive control over all the relations of private life . Even the ecclesiastics did not love his authority : they acquiesced in it because it was ecclesiastical : the laity endured it with the utmost impatience . It was inevitable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about jurisdiction should be mentioned . The Lower House began its action with a detailed charge against the spiritual courts , not merely against their abuses and the oppression that arose from them , but against their very existence and their legislation ; the clergy made laws without the King 's foreknowledge , without the participation of any laymen , and yet the laity were bound by them . The King was called on to reconcile his subjects of the spiritual and temporal estate with each other by good laws , since he was their sole head , the sovereign lord and protector of both parties . It was a slight phrase ' ' , the sole head of his subjects spiritual and temporal , ' but one of the weightiest import . The very existence of the clergy as an order had hitherto depended precisely on their claim to a legislative power independent of the temporal supremacy as being their original right : on its universal maintenance rested the Papacy and its influence on the several countries . Were the clergy now to leave it to the King , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences between their legislation and that of the state ? Were they , like the laity , virtually to recognise him as their Head ? It is clear that they would thus sever themselves from the // great union under one spiritual Head , from the constitution of the Latin Church . Whoever it was that introduced the word Head , ' no doubt had this in view . The King and the laity took it up , they wished only to induce the clergy themselves to come to a resolution in this sense . The chief motive which was to serve this purpose is connected with the lordship which the Popes possessed in England in the thirteenth century , or rather with the reaction against it which went on throughout the fourteenth . This is most distinctly expressed in the statutes of 1393 , which threatened with the severest penalties all participation in any attempt , to the injury of the King 's supremacy , to obtain a church-benefice from Rome ; and this too even where the King had given his consent to it . Clergy and laity were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolsey was now accused of having transgressed this statute : he had in virtue of his legatine power given away benefices , and established a jurisdiction by which that of the King was encroached on ; he was found guilty of this in regular form . He anticipated the full effect of this sentence by submitting without any defence and surrendering all his property to the King . It was then that York House in Westminster , with its gardens and the land adjoining , the Whitehall of later times , passed into the possession of the crown 2 . He still kept his archbishopric ; we find him soon after at Caywood , the palace belonging to it , and in fact even busied once more with his buildings . At times the King again thought of his old counsellor , and to many it quite seemed as though he might yet recover power . In those days the general belief was , that Anne Boleyn had exerted her whole influence against it . But most of the other persons of distinction in court and state were also opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , try to gain a party among the clergy , and move the Pope to pronounce excommunication against the King 3 ? A pretext at // any rate was found for arresting him as a traitor : but as he was being brought to the Tower , he died on the way . He wished , so far as we know , to starve himself to death ; it was at that time supposed that in his wish to die he was aided by help from others . Neither for his mental nor for his moral qualities can Wolsey be reckoned among men of the first rank ; yet his position and the ability which he showed in it , his ambition and his political plans , what he did and what he suffered , his success and his fall , have won him an imperishable name in English history . His attempt to link the royal power with the Papacy by the closest ties rent them asunder for ever . No sooner was he dead than the clergy became subject to the Crown ? a subjection which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergy was so far involved in Wolsey 's guilt that it had supported his Legatine Powers , and so had shared in the violation of the statutes . It shows the English spirit of keeping to the strict letter of the law , that the King , though he had for years given his consent and help in all this , now came forward to avenge the violation of the law . To avert his displeasure the Convocation of Canterbury was forced to vote him a very considerable sum of money , yet even this did not satisfy him . Rather it seemed to him the fitting and decisive moment for forcing the clergy , conformably with the Address of the Commons , to accept the Anglican point of view . He demanded from Convocation the express acknowledgment that they recognised him as the Protector and the Supreme Head of the Church and Clergy of England , he commanded the judges not to issue the Act of Pardon unless this acknowledgment were at once incorporated with the bill for the money payment . It is not hard to see what made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the serious turn which the affair of his Divorce had taken at Rome . He had once more made application to the Curia to let it be decided in England ; the Cardinals discussed the point in their Consistory , Dec. 22 , 1530 , but resolved that the question must come of right before the Assessors of the Rota , who should afterwards report on it to // the Sacred College I. What their sentence would be was the less doubtful , since the Curia was now linked closer than ever with the Emperor , who had just closed the Diet of Augsburg in the way they wished , and was now about to carry out its decrees . The traces of a new alliance with Rome , which was imputed to Wolsey as an act of treason , must have contributed to the same result . The King wished to break off this connexion by a Declaration , which would serve him as a standing-ground later on , and show the Court of Rome that he had nothing to fear from it . On Feb. 7 , 1531 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Convocation . Who could avoid seeing its decisive significance for the age ? The clergy , which had without much trouble agreed to the money-vote , nevertheless strove long against a Declaration which altered their whole position . But a hard necessity lay on them . In default of the Pardon , which , as the judges repeatedly assured them , depended on this Declaration , they would have found themselves out of the protection of the King and the Law . They sent two bishops , to get the King 's demand softened by a personal appeal ; Henry VIII refused to hear them . They proposed that some members of both Houses should confer with the Privy Council and the judges ; the answer was that the King wished for no discussion , he wanted a clear answer . Thus much however they ascertained , that the King would be content with a mode of statement in which he was unconditionally recognised as the protector and sovereign of the Church and clergy of England , but as its supreme head only so far as religion allows . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is permitted by the law of Christ , an expression which men might assent to on opposite grounds . Some might accept it from seeing in it only the limitation which is set to all power by the laws of God ; others from thinking that it excluded generally the influence of the secular power on what were properly spiritual matters . When the clause was laid before them , at the morning sitting of Feb. 11 , it was received with an ambiguous silence ; but on closer consideration , it was so evidently their only possible resource , // that in the afternoon , first the Upper House of Convocation , and then the Lower , gave their consent . Then the King accepted the money-bill , and granted them in return the Act of Pardon 1 . The clergy had yet other causes for seeking the King 's protection . The writings of the Reformers , which attacked good works and vows , the Mass and the Priesthood , and all the principles on which the ecclesiastical system rested , found their way across the Channel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only safeguard against them lay in the King 's power ; his protection was no empty word , the clergy was lost if it drew on itself Henry 's aversion , which was now directed against the Papal See . The heavy weight of the King 's hand and the impulse of self-preservation were however not the only reasons why they yielded . It is undeniable that the conception of the Universal Church , according to which the National Church did but form part of a larger whole , was nearly as much lost among the clergy as among the laity . In the Parliament of 1532 Convocation had presented a petition in which they desired to be released from the payments which had been hitherto made to the supreme spiritual authority , especially the annates and firstfruits . The National Church was the existing , immediate authority ? why should they allow taxes to be laid on them for a distant Power , a Power moreover of which they had no need ? As the bishops complained that this injured their families and their benefices , Parliament calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this ground since Henry VII 's time , and which it would soon draw at the impending vacancies ; what losses the country had already suffered in this way , and would yet suffer 2 The tendency of men 's minds in this direction showed itself also in the understanding come to on the chief question of all . // Parliament renewed its complaints of the abuses in the ecclesiastical legislation , and learned men brought out clearly the want of any divine authority to justify it ; at last the bishops virtually renounced their right of special legislation , and pledged themselves for the future not to issue any kind of Ordinance or Constitution without the King 's knowledge and consent . A revision of the existing canons by a mixed commission , under the presidentship of their common head , the King , was to restore the unity of legislation . The clause was then necessarily omitted by which the recognition of the Crown 's supremacy over the clergy had been hitherto limited . The defenders of the secular power put forth the largest claims . They said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' souls , the Parliament is divinely empowered to make ordinances concerning them also 1 . So a consolidation of public authority grew up in England , unlike anything which had yet been seen in the West . One of the great statutes that followed begins with the preamble that England is a realm to which the Almighty has given all fulness of power , wider one supreme head , the King , to whom the body politic has to pay natural obedience , next after God ; that this body consists of clergy and laity ; to the first belongs the decision in questions of the divine law and things spiritual , while temporal affairs devolve on the laity ; that one jurisdiction aids the other for the due administration of justice , no foreign intervention is needed . This is the Act by which , for these very reasons , legal appeals to Rome were abolished . It was now possible to carry out what in previous centuries had been at-. tempted in vain . All encroachments on the prerogative of the Imperial Crown ' were to be abolished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be valid no longer ; appeals to Rome were not only forbidden but subjected to penalties . The several powers of the realm united to throw off the foreign authority which had hitherto influenced them , and which // limited the national independence , as being itself a higher power . As the oaths taken by the bishops were altered to suit these statutes , the King set himself to modify his coronation oath also in the same sense . He would not swear any longer to uphold the rights of the Church in general , but only those guaranteed to the Church of England , and not derogatory to his own dignity and jurisdiction ; he did not pledge himself to maintain the peace of the Church absolutely , but only the concord between the clergy and his lay subjects according to his conscience ; not , unconditionally , to maintain the laws and customs of the land , but only those that did not conflict with his crown and imperial duties . He promised favour only for the cases in which favour ought to find a place t . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal right , and of kingly independence ! Henry VIII too regarded himself as a successor of Constantine the Great , who had given laws to the Church . True , said he , kings are sons of the Church , but not the less are they supreme over Christian men . Of the doctrines which came from Germany none found greater acceptance with him than this ? that every man must be obedient to the higher powers . We possess Tyndale 's book in which these principles are set forth ; by Anne Boleyn 's means it came into Henry 's hands . That Pope Clement summoned him formally before his judgment-seat , he declared to be an offence to the Kingly Majesty . Was a Prince , he exclaims , to submit himself to a creature whom God had made subject to him ; to humble himself before a man who , in opposition to God and Right , wished to oppress him ? It would be a reversal of the ordinance of God ' . Whilst we follow the questions which here come into discussion ? on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kings ? questions of infinite importance for this as // for all other states , we almost lose sight of the affair of the Divorce , which had been the original cause of quarrel , and which had meanwhile moved on in the direction given it once for all . Pope Clement restrained himself as much as possible , he still more than once made advances to the King and offered him conciliatory terms ; but the King had already gone too far in his separation from Rome to be able to accept them . At the beginning of 1533 he celebrated his marriage with Anne Boleyn privately . He had once , when he was still waiting for the Pope 's decision , tried to influence it by favourable opinions of learned theologians i . With this view he had applied to the most distinguished universities in Italy and Germany , in France and in England itself ; and managed to obtain a large number of decisions , by which the Pope 's right of dispensation was denied ; and this in spite of the constant efforts in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bologna and Paris , had declared in his favour . He protested that he had been thereby enabled in his conscience to free himself from the yoke of an unlawful union , bordering on incest , and to proceed to another marriage . But all the more urgent was it that the legality of this marriage should be recognised according to the forms at that time lawfully valid . He no longer wished for a recognition from the Pope ; he laid the question before the two Convocations of the English Church-provinces . For the general course of Church history we must admit it to be an event of the highest significance , that they dared to pronounce the dispensation of Pope Julius II invalid according to God 's law . The authority hitherto regarded as the expression of God 's will on earth was found guilty , by the representatives of the Church of one particular country , of transgressing that will . It now followed that the King 's marriage , concluded on the strength of that dispensation , was declared by the Archbishop 's court at Canterbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Catharine was henceforth to be treated no longer as Queen but only as still Princess-dowager . She was unable to realise the things that were happening around her . That she was expected to renounce her rank as Queen awoke in her quite as much astonishment as anger . For she had not come to England , ' she said , ' on mercantile business at a venture , but according to the will of the two venerated kings now dead : she had married King Henry according to the decision of the Holy Father at Rome : she was the anointed and crowned Queen of England ; were she to give up her title , she would have been a concubine these twenty-four years , and her daughter a bastard ; she would be false to her conscience , to her own soul , her confessor would not be able to absolve her . ' She became more and more absorbed in strict Catholic religious observances . She rose soon after midnight , to be present at the mass ; under her dress she wore the habit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fasted twice a week ; her reading consisted of the legends of the saints . So she lived on for two years more , undisturbed by the ecclesiastico-political statutes which passed in the English Parliament . Till the very end she regarded herself as the true Queen of England . Immediately after the sentence on Catharine followed Anne 's coronation , which was performed with all the ancient ceremonial , all the more carefully attended to because she was not born a princess . On the Thursday before Whitsuntide she was escorted from Greenwich by the Mayor and the Trades of London , in splendidly adorned barges , with musical instruments playing , till she was greeted by the cannon of the Tower . The Saturday after she went in procession through the City to Westminster . The King had created eighteen knights of the Order of the Bath . These in their new decorations , and a great part of the nobility , which felt itself honoured in Anne 's elevation , accompanied her 1 : she sat on a splendid seat , supported by and slung between horses : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cinque Ports ; her hair was uncovered , she was charming as always , and ( it appears ) not without a sense of high good fortune . On Sunday she was escorted to Westminster Abbey by the Archbishop of Canterbury and six bishops , the Abbot of Westminster and twelve other abbots in full canonicals : she was in purple , her ladies in scarlet , for so old custom required ; the Duke of Suffolk bore the crown before her , which was placed on her head by the hands of the archbishop . Nobles and commons greeted her with emulous devotion , the ecclesiastics joined in ; they expected from her an heir to England . ? Not a son , but a daughter , Elizabeth , did she then bear beneath her heart . Anne 's coronation was at the same time the complete expression of the revolt of the nation collectively from the Roman See : it is noteworthy that Pope Clement VII , in his all-calculating and temporising policy , even then reserved to himself the last word . As he had once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , so now again ? for he did not wish to be entirely dependent on him ? he had entered into close relations with King Francis , who on his side saw in the continuance of his union with England one of the conditions of his position in Europe . The political weight of England reacted indirectly on the Pope : he indeed annulled Archbishop Cranmer 's decision , but he could not yet bring himself to take a further step , often as he had promised the Emperor and pledged himself in his agreements to do so 1 . Charles V supplied his ambassador at Rome with yet another means to advance ( as he expressed himself ) the decision of the proceedings with the Pope and with the Holy See ? for he made a distinction between them . The Pope inquired of him what , after this had ensued , would then be done to carry it out . The Emperor answered , his Holiness should do what justice pledged him to do , what he could not omit if he would fulfil his duty to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this must come first , the Church must use all its own // means before it called in the temporal arm : but if the matter came to that point , he would not fail to do his part ; to declare himself explicitly beforehand might excite religious scruplesl . And however much the policy of the Pope might waver , there could be no doubt about the decision of the Rota . On the 23 March 1534 one of the auditors , Simonetta , bishop of Pesaro , made a statement on the subject in the consistory of the cardinals : there were only three among them who demanded a further delay : all the rest joined without any more consideration in the decision that Henry 's marriage with Catharine was perfectly lawful , and their children legitimate and possessed of full rights . The Imperialists held this to be a great victory , they made the city ring with their cries of the Empire and Spain ' 2 : yet even then the French did not give up the hope of bringing the Pope to another mind . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Henry reckons it as honourable to himself that he had not yielded to the offer of the Roman Court , made to him indirectly , to decide in his favour , but had set himself against its usurped jurisdiction , without being influenced by the proposal , not for himself alone but in the interest of all kings . Yet once more had he laid the question before learned ecclesiastics , whether the Pope of Rome had any authority in England by divine right ; as the University of Oxford declares , their theologians had searched for this through the books of Holy Scripture and its most approved interpreters ; they had compared the places , conferred with each other on them and come at last to the conclusion , to answer the King 's question unreservedly in the negative . The Cambridge scholars and both Convocations declared themselves in the same sense . On this the Parliament had no scruple in abrogating piece by piece the hierarchic-Romish order of things ; it was // nothing but a revocable right which they had hitherto borne with . The Annates were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishop to receive his pallium from Rome . It was made penal to apply for dispensing faculties ; with their abolition the fees usually paid for them also ceased . The oldest token of the devotion of the Anglo-Saxon race to the Roman See , the Peter 's penny , was definitely abolished . Care was taken that for the appeal in the last resort , hitherto made to the Roman courts , there should be a similar court at home . On the other hand the King granted a greater freedom in the election of bishops , at least in its outward forms . The existing laws against heretics were confirmed , though those independent proceedings of the bishops which had been usual in the times of the Lancasters received some limitation . For the episcopal constitution and the old doctrine were to be retained : the wish was to establish an Anglo-Catholic Church tinder the supremacy of the crown . The King added to his titles the designation of Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England immediately under God . ' The Parliament awarded him the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to errors , as well as the right of reforming them . For the exercise moreover of the Papal authority , which so far passed over to him , he had an example before him which he had only to follow . Wolsey for a series of years , as Legate of the Pope and then as his Vicar General , had administered the English Church by means of English courts : the unity of the English common-weal had been represented in his twofold power as legate and first minister ; practically it was no violent change when the King himself now appointed a Vicar General who , empowered by him , exercised this authority without any reference to the Pope . It was an assistant of Wolsey , Thomas Cromwell , who was at the same time Keeper of the Great Seal , who regulated the management of these affairs in a way not altogether new to him . From this point of view Wolsey represents exactly the man of the transition , who occupied the intermediate position in nationalising the English Church . Though Henry VIII did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet his genuine successor in the work he 15o SEPARATION OF THE ENGLISH CHURCH . n. q. began . What the first Tudor achieved in the temporal domain , viz. the exclusion of foreign influence , that the second extended to spiritual affairs . The great question now was , whether the conflicting elements , in themselves independent but ceaselessly agitated by their connexion with the rest of Europe , would continue loyal to the idea of the common-weal ; then even their opposition might become a new impulse and help to perfect the power of the State and the Constitution . CHAPTER V. THE OPPOSING TENDENCIES WITHIN THE SCHISMATIC STATE . AMONG the results of these transactions in England that which most directly concerned the higher interests of the nation was the abolition , by a formal decision of Parliament , on religious grounds , of the hereditary title of the King 's ( laughter by his Spanish Queen , and the recognition of the succession of Queen Anne 's issue to the throne , even in the case of her having only the one daughter who had been meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual measures taken as on the fact , that now , according to Wolsey 's plan , the government had broken with the political system which had prevailed hitherto , and indeed in a sense that went far beyond his views . Not merely was a French alliance avoided ; the separation from the Church of Rome was to become the basis of the whole dynastic settlement of England . At home men felt most the harshness and violence of basing a political rule on Church ideas . The statute contains threats of the sharpest punishments against all who should do or write or even say anything against it : a commission was appointed , in which we find the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk , which could require every one to take an oath of conformity to it . It was to be carried out with the full weight of English adherence to the law . It was to this very statute that Bishop Fisher of Rochester and Sir Thomas More fell victims . They did not refuse to acknowledge the order of succession itself thus enacted , for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // not confirm with their oath the reason laid down in the statute , that Henry 's marriage with Catharine was against Scripture and invalid from the beginning . More ranks among the original minds of this great century : he is the first who learnt how to write English prose ; but in the great currents of the literary movement he shrank back from the foremost place : after he had aided them by writings in the style of Erasmus , he set himself as Lord Chancellor of England to oppose their onward sweep with much rigour : he would not have the Church community itself touched . Of the last statute he said , it killed either the body if one opposed it , or the soul if one obeyed : he preferred to save his soul . He met his death with so lively a realisation of the future life , in which the troubles of this life would cease , that he looked on his departure out of it with all the irony which was in general characteristic of him . The fact that the Pope at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church seems to have still more hastened his execution . They both died as martyrs to the ideas by which England had been hitherto linked to the Church community of the West and to the authority of the Papacy . If we turn our eyes abroad , the succession statute above all must have made a most disagreeable impression on the Emperor Charles V. He saw in it a political loss , an injury to his house , and indeed to all sovereign families , and a danger to the Church . With a view to opposing it , he formed the plan of drawing the King of France into an enterprise against England . He proposed to him the marriage of his third son , the Duke of Angouleme , with the Princess Mary , who was recognised as the only lawful heiress of England by the Apostolic See , and whose claims would then accrue to this prince 1 . And they would not be difficult , so he said , to establish , as a great part of the English abhorred the King 's proceedings , his second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time the Emperor proposed the closest dynastic union of the two houses by a double marriage of his two children with a son and a daughter of ii . ; . WITHIN THE SCHISMATIC STATE . X53 Francis I. What in the whole world would he not have attained , if he had won over France to himself ! His combination embraced as usual West and East , Church and State , Italian German and Northern affairs . Perhaps the success of such a scheme was not probable ; but independently of this , Henry VIII had good cause to prepare himself to meet the superior power of the Emperor , with whom he had so decidedly broken . As we have already hinted , he could have no want of allies in this struggle . It was under these circumstances that he entered into relations with the powerful demagogues who were then from their central position at Lubeck labouring to transform the North , and to sever it from all Netherlandish-Burgundian influence . But it was of still more importance to him to form an alliance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually become a power in opposition to Pope and Emperor . In the autumn of 1535 we find English ambassadors in Germany , who attended the meeting of the League at Schmalkald , and the most serious negociations i were entered on . Both sides were agreed not to recognise the Council which was then announced by the Pope , for the very reason that the Pope announced it , who had no right to do so . The German princes demanded an engagement that if one of the two parties was attacked , the other should lend no support to its enemy ; for the King this was not enough ; he wished , in case he was attacked , to be able to reckon on support from Germany in cavalry , infantry , and ships , in return for which he was ready to give a very considerable contribution to the chest of the League . I t was even proposed that he should undertake the protection of the League i . All this however was based on a presupposition , which could not but lead the English to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution and administration of justice , but a complete system of dissentient Church doctrines , with which Henry VIII came in contact . The Lerman Protestants made it a condition of their alliance with // England , that there should be full agreement between them as to doctrine . We may ask whether this was altogether possible . If we compare the Church movements and events that had taken place during the last years in Germany and in England , their great difference is visible at a glance . In Germany the movement was theological and popular , corresponding to the wants and needs of the territorial state ; in England it was juridico-canonical , not connected with appeals to the people or with free preaching , but based on the unity of the nation . Though the German Diet had for a moment inclined to the Reform and had once even given it a legal sanction , it afterwards by a majority set itself against it : to carry it through became now the part of the minority , the Protesting party . In England on the contrary all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Parliament , in which the bishops themselves with few exceptions took part . Perhaps a more deep-seated ground of difference may be that the German bishops were more independent than the English , and that an Emperor was then ruling who , being at the same time King of Spain and Naples , troubled himself little about the unity of Germany in particular ; while in England a newly-formed strong political power existed which made the national interests its own and upheld them on all sides . Despite all this the English Schism had nevertheless a deep inner analogy with the German Reformation . From the beginning the dispute as to jurisdiction was based on the historical point of view , on which Luther too laid much stress . Standish , who has been already mentioned , derived the right to limit the ecclesiastical prerogatives , from this among other grounds , that there were Christian churches in which they were altogether rejected , for instance the rule as to the celibacy of the clergy was not accepted by the Greeks . He inferred too , that , as no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian , the conception of the universal Church must be different from that which Romanism asserts . Both countries also found the groundwork of the true church-community in Scripture . // In the chief instance before them , that of the divorce , the German theologians were not of the same mind as the English ; but both sides agreed in this , that there was a revealed will of God , which the ecclesiastical power might not contravene : the conviction took root that the Papacy did not represent the highest communion of men with divine things , but that this rested on the divine record alone . The use of Scripture had at last influenced various questions in England also . For abolishing the Annates it was argued that such an impost contradicts a maxim of the Apostle Paul ; for doing away the Papal jurisdiction , that no place of Scripture justifies it . This is what was meant when the assertion that the Papacy is of divine right was denied . This becomes quite clear when Henry VIII instead of the previous prohibitions against distributing the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he once declared with great animation , the advancement of God 's word and of his own authority were one and the same thing 1 . The engraved title-page of the translation which appeared with his privilegium puts into his mouth the expression Thy word is a light to my feet . ' The order soon followed to place a copy of the Book of books in every church : there every man might look into the disputed places , and convince himself , by this highest of codes , as to the rightfulness of the procedure that had been chosen . But then it was impossible to stop at mere divergences of jurisdiction . The German interpretation of Scripture gained I ground in every direction : a theological school grew up , though only here and there , which adhered to it more or less openly . It must needs have had the greatest effect , that the followers of this view obtained a great number of bishoprics . The archbishopric of Canterbury had already fallen to the lot ' Of a man who had completed his theological training in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried through the divorce ; his was one of those natures which must have the support of the supreme power to help them to follow out their I56 JHE OPPOSING TENDENCIL 'S ir . 5. own views ; as they then appear enterprising and courageous , so do they become pliant and yielding when this favour fails them ; they do not shine through moral greatness , but they are well suited to preserve , under difficult circumstances , what they have once embraced , for better times . Hugh Latimer was cast in a sterner mould ; he actually dared , in the midst of the persecutions , to admonish the King , whose chaplain he was , of the welfare of his soul and his duty as King . However little this act effected for the moment , yet he may have thus contributed to enlighten the King ( who now and then showed him personal goodwill ) as to his title of Defender of the Faith . ' Latimer was a fervent and effective preacher : he was made bishop of Worcester . Nicolas Shaxton , Bishop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and then S. David 's , Goodrich of Ely , were all disposed to Protestantism . Edward Fox who had been named Bishop of Hereford , had at Schmalkald openly declared the Pope to be Antichrist , and assured the Protestants in the strongest manner of his sovereign 's inclination to attach himself to their Confession . It was the grand union of these biblical scholars among the bishops , which in the Convocation of 1536 undertook to carry through the work of drawing their church nearer that of Germany . Latimer opened the war by a fervent sermon against image-worship , indulgences , purgatory , and other doctrines or rites which were at variance with the Bible . Cranmer proved that Holy Scripture contains all that is necessary for man to know for the salvation of his soul , and that tradition is not needed . The Bishop of Hereford communicated it , as an experience of his journey , that the laity everywhere would now be instructed only out of the Revelation . Thomas Cromwell , who took part in the sittings as the King 's representative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Scottish scholar who had just returned from Wittenberg , to combat the received doctrine of the Sacrament On the other side also stood men of weight and consideration , Lee archbishop of York who had exII. // presafy opposed himself , together with his clergy , to the adoption of the King 's new title , Stokesley of London who broke a lance for the seven sacraments , Gardiner of Winchester and Longland of Lincoln who after contributing materially to the King 's divorce nevertheless rejected any alteration in doctrine , Tonstall of Durham , Nix of Norwich . It seems as though the King , who was still busied in the Parliament itself with the confirmation of his church regulations , thought he detected in this party too much predilection for the Papacy . He found another motive in the necessity of having allies for the coming Council ; he decisively took the side of Reform . Ten articles were laid before the Convocation in his name , the first five of which are taken from the Augsburg Confession or from the commentaries on it ; as to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In them the faithful were referred exclusively to the contents of the Bible , and the three oldest creeds ; only three sacraments were still recognised , Baptism , Penance , and the Lord 's Supper . The real presence was maintained in them , in the words of those commentaries , and entirely in Luther 's original sense ' . But still this tendency was not yet so strong as to be able to make itself exclusively felt . In the following articles , the veneration , even the invocation , of saints , and no small part of the existing ceremonies , were allowed ? though in terms which with all their moderation can not disguise the rejection of them in principle . Despite these limitations the document contains a clear adoption of the principles of religious reform as they were carried out in Germany . It was subscribed by 18 bishops , 40 abbots and . priors , 50 members of the lower house of Convocation : the King , as the Head of the Church , promulgated it for general observance . His vicegerent in Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls to explain the articles , and also at certain times to lay before the people the rightfulness of the abrogation of Papal authority . He required them to give warnings // against image-worship , belief in modern miracles , and pilgrimages . Children were henceforth to learn the Lord 's Prayer , the articles of the Creed , and the Ten Commandments in English ' . It was the beginning of the Church service in the vernacular , which was rightly regarded as the chief means of withdrawing the national Church from Romish influence . But Cromwell was also engaged in another enterprise , not less hostile and injurious to the Papacy . As many of the great men in State and Church thought , so thought also the pious members of the monasteries and cloistered convents ; they opposed the Supremacy , not as they said from inclination to disobedience , but because Holy Mother Church ordered otherwise than King and Parliament ordained ' . The apology merely served to condemn them . In the rules they followed , in the Orders to which they belonged , the intercommunion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was exactly this which King and Parliament wished to sever . Wolsey had already , as we know , and with the help of Cromwell himself , taken in hand to suppress many of them : but in the new order of things there was absolutely no more place for the monastic system ; it was necessarily sacrificed to the unity of the country , and at the same time to the greed of the great men . But it can not be imagined that innovations which struck so deep could be carried through without opposition . After all the efforts of the old kings to establish Christianity in agreement with Rome , after the victories of the Papacy when the kings quarrelled with it , and the violent suppression of all dissent , it was inevitable that the belief of the hierarchic ages , which is besides so peculiarly adapted to this end , had in England as elsewhere sunk deep into men 's minds , and in great measure still swayed them . Was what had been always held for heresy no longer to merit this name because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern counties neither the clergy nor the people would hear of // the King 's supremacy ; they continued to pray for the Pope ; Cromwell 's injunctions were disregarded . It may be that horrible abuses and vices were prevalent in the cloisters , but all did not labour under such reproaches ; many were objects of reverence in their own districts , and centres of hospitality and charity . It would have been wonderful if their violent destruction had not excited popular discontent . And this temper was shared by those who enjoyed the chief consideration in the provinces . Among the nobles there were still men like Lord Darcy of Templehurst , who had borne arms against the Moors in the service of Isabella and Ferdinand : how offensive to them must innovations be which ran counter to all their reminiscences ! The lords in these provinces were believed to have pledged their word to each other to suppress the heresies , as they called the Protestant opinions , together with their authors and abettors . The country people , who apprehended yet further encroachments , were easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from house to house , and the strongest men of each parish provided with the necessary weapons : in the autumn of 1536 open revolt broke out . A lawyer , Robert Aske , placed himself at its head ; he set before the people all the damage that the suppression of the monasteries did to the country around , by diverting their revenues and abstracting their treasures . In a short time he had gained over the whole of the North . The city of York joined him ; Darcy admitted him into the strong castle of Pomfret : in that broad county only one single castle still held out in its obedience to the government : then the neighbouring districts also were carried away by the movement : Aske saw an army of thirty thousand men around him .
