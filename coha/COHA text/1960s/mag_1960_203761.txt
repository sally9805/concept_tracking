For auto buffs and newspaper photographers , the liveliest game at this time of the year is matching wits against carmakers to get pictures of new car models before company officials release them . To guard against premature snooping , automakers cover their latest creations with white shrouds , hide them on dealers ' roofs and behind high fences , usually move them about after dark . But enterprising newsmen have hired helicopters to spot the new models , often wait on street corners in hopes of snapping one as it passes by on its way to a dealer . Automakers defend their summer secrecy on the ground that early pictures of new cars encourage customers to wait for the new models in stead of buying current models . They also hope to achieve maximum publicity impact by releasing stories and pictures in all newspapers and magazines on a set day . Last week the game was on , with new models in production but official debuts still weeks away . <P> The buffs scored two victories against Chrysler . While passing the Plymouth plant in Detroit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards down , spotted a group of 1961 Plymouth sedans behind a chain-link fence .

In Queens , N.Y. , a sharp-eyed auto buff spotted both a new Plymouth Fury and a 1961 compact Valiant on a dealer 's roof , stopped long enough to photograph them . Last month a Lansing , Mich , photographer made the biggest score of the season when he was tipped that the new Oldsmobile compact , the F-85 , would appear on the street briefly for final inspection and testing . He laid in wait , got the shots and sold them to U.P.I. <P> Automobile pressagents impose strict release dates on pictures they supply the press in advance , but some of them privately admire the enterprise of photographers who get pictures of the new autos elsewhere . In fact , while holding sternly to the rules of the game officially , some pressagents are not above dropping a few hints to favored photographers as to how they might beat their competitors to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just run out of shrouds after the new models get into fairly good production .
