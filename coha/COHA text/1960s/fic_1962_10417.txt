'm not flying in the face of my instincts any more , Martha . I 'm n turning off my fires any more . I 'll follow what I have to follow  --  I ' stopping being anxious , Martha  --  we make the laws , we do . I can keep being what I 've been . I want to be happy , Martha . I want to with you . " I stopped , and heard what I thought for a moment was som thing as noncommittal as a cough . But it was the beginning of tear She said , " Oh , you 're drunk , baby  --  but come , come anyway . " " What about Daddy ? " Cynthia asked . " Daddy has decided to live in Arizona . He decided that a longtime ago . I do n't think that Daddy is a consideration here .

" " Will he sleep in bed with you ? " Cynthia asked . In the kitchen I sat at the uncleared table , drinking my coffee ; in the children 's room I heard Martha say that I would . " Where 's Arizona again ? " Mark asked . " In the southwest of the United States . I showed you on the map . " Cynthia spoke next , her words a surprise . I did not expect that she would choose so quickly to be distracted . " What 's the capital ? " she asked . " Tucson . Phoenix , " Martha said . " I 'm not sure . " " What 's the capital of Illinois ? " Cynthia asked . " Springfield . " " Why do n't they make it Chicago ? " asked Cynthia . " I do n't know , sweetheart . " " Gabe knows , " Markie said . " He probably does , " Martha said . " I 'll bet he does n't , " Cynthia said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was ; I pushed my chair away from the kitchen table and went into the children 's room , where the little lamp between the beds illuminated the wall upon which Martha 's kids had poured out all their talent and aspirations . In a dim light , the crayoned stick figures , the stick houses , and round radiant suns and gloomy moonsp301had about them a charm and gaiety that at this particular moment had no effect upon the seriousness of my mood or mission . Cynthia was sitting up in bed , wearing over her pajamas one of her Christmas presents  --  a red Angora sweater ; she was surrounded by her nurse 's kit , her Spanish doll , and the Monopoly set , upon which the first game had been played that afternoon by Martha , me , Cynthia , and Cynthia 's friend Stephanie . Mark 's head was on his pillow and his hands were tucked under his crisp sheets . He was looking very happy about being in bed . A wad of clay sat on the pillow beside his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , and had bawled loud and long throughout the day whenever separation had been suggested . It had fallen into his soup at dinner , but now that was all forgotten . Martha stood by the window , hefty in a pair of faded dungarees , with her hair pulled into one long dramatic braid down her back . She was rocking on the outer edges of her blue sneakers , and her body was arranged in what I had come to think of as her posture : right hand on the chin , left hand just below the hip , fingers spread down and out over the can . Though she had earlier requested that I not be present for this scene  --  and though I had willingly agreed  --  she looked in my direction with a face upon which worry turned to relief , relief to hope . She smiled , a what-do-we-do-next smile , and sighed . " Do I or do n't I know what ? " I asked . Cynthia said , " Why is n't Chicago the capital ? " " Of America ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough question . " I looked over to where Markie lay in his neat little bed . " Probably , " I said , " because it gets too cold for a capital here . Capitals are where the big shots live ; I suppose they like it warm . What do you think , Mark ? Does it look warm outside to you ? " He propped himself up on his elbows . " I ca n't see . Mommy 's by the window . " Martha moved to the side ; she looked at me as though I had announced I would now pull a rabbit from a hat , without even having a hat , let alone the rabbit . Snowflakes were tapping against the pane . " Does it ? " I asked . " No , " Markie said , though he looked up at me willing to be corrected . " Does it to you ? " I asked Cynthia.  |p302With  a lofty sophistication , she said , " It 's snowing . " But for flicker of a second she had almost smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his right mind would make this place a capital ? " After a moment Cynthia spoke again . " Where are you going to sleep ? " " With Martha , " I said . " Maybe , " said Martha , moving now between their beds , " you should close your eyes , sweethearts . You had a very tiring day . Come on , Cyn , take off your sweater . " " I think I want to wear it . " " Honey , it 's brand new . You can wear it tomorrow . " " I want to wear it now ! " Martha took my hand . " Wear it , Cynthia , " she said . " And go to sleep . " She leaned over and kissed each child . " Good night . " " Can Gabe kiss us ? " Markie asked . " Sure , " his mother said . I leaned down and kissed Markie , who stuck his lips directly into mine . I put my lips to the cheek that Cynthia had turned toward me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll have fuzzy dreams in that sweater . " " I 'll be all right , " Cynthia said ; and Martha turned off the light.  | " I loaned her a hundred , " Martha said . " And so is that what all this irritation with me is about ? " " I 'm not irritated with you . " " Because we can call them up , Martha . We can tell them not to come . " " What 's that have to do with anything ? The roast is in the oven . We invited them . Let 's leave it that way . " " Then what is it , Martha ? " " Nothing . " " What is she going to do with the money ? Are you going to get that money back ? " " I suppose so . " " Martha , sit down and forget those potatoes a minute . " " Your friends will be coming  --  " " And what 's this my friends ' business ? We discussed whom we would have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't want any of them . " " Divorced women depress me . Please , " she said , " I have to finish here . " " What 's eating you ?

"  |p304She  moved into a chair opposite me at the kitchen table , holdin a spatula in her hand . " Most of it , " she answered . " Including what I gave you ? " " Are you going to cause a fuss about that ? " " I 'm not causing a fuss over anything . " " Well , you only gave me forty bucks , " she said , " so obvious the other sixty was mine . And the rent 's a hundred and thirty , I mean forty bucks does n't get me very far . " " We 've been through all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I did n't ask you to give me that money .

" " Thanks , " she said , and got up and went over to the sink . " Sissy only lived in one room , " she informed me . " Then I 'll pay half the rent . If that 's what you want me to do , why do n't you say so ? " She turned and faced me . " You 've still got your other apart-ment . " " Do n't worry about my other apartment . If I want to be a hotshot and have one and a half apartments , that 's my business . " " Why do you have to keep the other one ? " she asked . " Isn'tit silly , is n't it a waste ? " " It 's eighty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my colleagues . He that filches from me my good name , and so on . Please , if I do n't mind the eighty-five . . . Please , do n't fret , Martha . If you 're upset , if you do n't want people for dinner  --  " " Who said I did n't want people ? Who mentioned people ? " "  --  because it 's not too late . I can call them and cancel the whole thing . We can eat the roast ourselves . " " They 're as good as anybody else , " she mumbled , and plowed into the breakfast and lunch dishes that were still stacked in the sink . " What kind of attitude is that ? Turn that damn water off , please . I thought you were enthusiastic about having somebody for dinner . I thought you thought it would be a great pleasure for us , very domestic . " " Everything 's domestic enough , thank you . "  | " Look , it was your idea to have somebody for dinner . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a pleasure . " " It probably will be . " " Martha , I 'm going to make out a check . We 'll split the rent . " " You do n't have to pay anything , really . You do n't even have to pay Sissy 's forty . " " I want to . " " Her moving had nothing to do with you . I told you that . " " I 'll split the rent . I 'll give you a check for twenty-five dollars more , is that agreeable to you ? " " . . . I suppose so . " " Well , what 's the matter now ? Do you want me to pay the whole rent ? " " Oh forget it . " " Excuse me if I 'm being obtuse . What is it you want to say to me ? " " Nothing . " " What is it ? " " Well "  --  she raised her hands , as though she had done everythingpossible to spare me  --  " honestly , Gabe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean we divide the grocery bill , and you 've got an appetite like a horse . " " What ? " " Last night you ate all the green beans , you ate two-thirds of the tuna yesterday afternoon  --  " " What 's going on here ? Cynthia ate all the ice cream , every last drop , just this afternoon , and did I start shouting about dividing the bills ? What 's the matter with you ? " " Why do n't you just leave Cynthia out of it ? There 's no need to be so hard on that poor kid . At least she can have some vanilla ice cream out of this deal , for God 's sake . " " I have n't been so hard on Cynthia , let 's get that straightened out . Nobody 's been hard on Cynthia , and least of all me . The truth of it  --  since we 're going to speak truths  --  is that I 'm paying half the groceries and feeding one mouth , and you 're paying half and feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God damned green beans , all right ? " " Well , you 're living here for practically nothing . " " I paid you forty bucks . " " Half of a hundred and thirty ai n't forty . " " I 'll pay sixty-five . I said I 'd pay sixty-five . "  | " What about the other apartment ? " " Let me worry about my other apartment , will you ? " - " I mean if you 've moved in here , you might as well move all the way in . " " I have moved all the way in . " " Not with another apartment , you have n't . " " I 've explained to you , Martha . It 's simply a matter of the University , my position , a matter of appearances and dignity  --  " " It 's not dignified enough , is it , living with me ? " " Oh the hell with it . You 're just being contrary , so the hell with it . " I went into the living room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the rug was being set by Cynthia . With a painstaking concern for symmetry , the child was aligning and realigning the dinner plates between their appropriately squadroned knives , forks , and spoons . She might just as well have been defusing a bomb , for the expression on her face . As she circled the table , she smoothed out the tiniest wrinkles in the white cloth . Markie was not around , having gone off to the playground with Stephanie and her grandmother ; Cynthia had begged that she be allowed to stay at home and help with the preparations . Already she had vacuumed rugs and gone around emptying ash trays , and for one optimistic moment I believed that since she knew it was friends of mine who were coming to dine , that with these labors she was making a bid for an end to hostilities between us . Not that she had n't been deferential to me for the two weeks I had been in her house , but it was Cynthia 's kind of deference . At dinnertime , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had even asked . She had not made the smallest offer of lips or face  --  neither a kiss or a smile  --  nor did she now . Watching her labor over the table , I concluded that all her dogged helpfulness was actually designed to ally herself with her mother against me . Martha and I had been sniping at each other for two days now , and Cynthia , a worldly and attentive baby , probably wanted only to make clear whose side she would be on , in the event of a full-scale war . I left her posing in aesthetic contemplation over an arrangement of serving dishes she had made in the center of the tablecloth . In the kitchen I sat down at the table , pushed aside a coffee cup , and wrote out a check . " This is for you , " I said . " I do n't need any checks . "  | " You 've got to pay the rent , so do n't be silly . " " I 'll explain that I 'm broke . I 'll pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twenty-five dollars . Stop being an ass . Twenty-five I owe you , the hundred is a loan . When your friend Theresa pays you back , you pay me back . " I went up to where she stood , leaning against the sink , and put the check in the pocket of her apron . " What did she need the hundred for ? " I asked . " I do n't know . I did n't inquire . A down payment on an abortion is probably a damn good guess . Look , I 'm sorry . I 've been being nervousabout the rent . " " Then why did n't you tell me ? If you feel rushed and upset , if you want me to  --  if you 're feeling harried  --  I 'll just call and say you 're not feeling well . " " Listen , if you want to call because you do n't want them , then go right ahead . Do n't try to slough it all off on me . I made dinner , and I 'm ready , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were your friends . I thought you thought we 'd all enjoy ourselves . " " I thought you might like them , yes . I thought they would like to meet you . " " Then let 's stop calling on the phone and telling them I 'm sick . I 'm not sick . " " Martha , please do n't worry about that hundred dollars . If that girl just takes off , if she 's going to buy a ticket for a train somewhere , you just forget it . " " I did n't bring you here to support me . " " I did n't come here to support you ! All I 'm saying is , do n't worry about the hundred . What the hell are we arguing about ? All right ? Just say all right , all right ? " " All right . " When the roast was nearly finished and Martha was dressing in the bathroom , the phone rang . She ran to it and spoke for some ten minutes , standing in her slip and bare feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not important . " " That Theresa girl , " I said . " How did you get so involved with her ? Why did n't you tell me about this ? " " There 's nothing to tell . " " She needs more money , does n't she ? " " Well , I do n't have any more ! " Martha shouted , and went back into the bathroom.  |p308Certainly  there were others we could have invited . Anyone a all , really , could have sat down with us , eaten our food , sipped our coffee , and then gone off to carry into the streets the news of ou unabashed , forthright , and impractical union . We needed only one couple  --  married preferably  --  to stand for the world and its opinions , one pair of outsiders to whom we could display our fundamental decency and good intentions , to whose judgment we could submit evidence of an ordered carnality and a restrained domestic life . Just one couple to give us society 's approval , if not the rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this that we were after when one sunny morning a week after I had moved in , Martha woke up and said , " Let 's have somebody for dinner ! " and I said , " What a splendid idea ! " That the couple we chose  --  I chose  --  was Libby and Paul was not really as thoughtless and unimaginative as it may seem . If anything , it was too imaginative , too thoughtful  --  or too thought out . Only a moment after our evening together began , I knew how it was going to end . I still maintain , however , that for every reason one can think of why all these people would never have liked one another , there was a perfectly good one why they should have . Paul Herz could be a witty man , certainly a pensive and attentive man . Libby could be lively and gay . Martha could always laugh . And as for me , I was more than willing to be any sort of middleman in order to bring to an unbloody conclusion a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are best left unconcluded . They ca n't be concluded  --  all one needs is to know that at the time . The first disappointment was Martha ; she wore the wrong clothes . I had thought she had been planning to don her purple wool suit , toward which I had both a sentimental and aesthetic attachment , or at least the skirt to the suit and her white silk blouse . But when she rushed past me to answer the knock at the front door , it was not a woman that moved by but a circus  --  a burst of color and a clattering of ornaments . She had managed to tart herself up in a full orange skirt , an off-the-shoulder blouse with a ruffled neck , strands of multicolored beads , and on her feet what I shall refer to in the language of the streets ( the streets around the University ) as her Humanities II sandals . So that none of us would miss the point , she had neither braided her hair nor put it up . It was combed straight out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mane drapedp309down her back and almost brushed her bottom . Somehow her outfit managed to call into question the very thing we wished ( or I wished ) to impress upon Libby and upon Paul  --  the seriousness of our relationship . That the Herzes ' lives were often more threatened than my own had led me on occasion to believe that their lives were also more serious than my own ; whatever the mixture of insight and bafflementthat had produced in me such an idea , it contributed also to the quality of my affections and anxieties where these two needy people were concerned . The visitors peered out of the stairway ; they were Paul and Libby Herz , they said , but was this Mrs. Reganhart 's apartment ? ApparentlyMartha looked to them as though she could not be a Mrs. anything , which may indeed have been what was in her head as she had dressed herself before her bedroom mirror . Perhaps what she had wanted to look precisely like was a free spirit , someone unworriedand without cares  --  for a change , nobody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure the Herzes thought she looked like  --  was some tootsie with whom I had decided to pass my frivolousdays . Through the early stages of their visit I felt some circumstantiallink between myself and a gigolo or pimp . Despite several energetic attempts to govern my unconscious , I began during dinner to make a series of disconnected remarks all of which turned out to have a decidedly smutty air . " So I laid it on the line to the Chancellor 's secretary  --  " " Remember Charlotte Foster from Iowa City ? Well , she turned up in Chicago and blew me to a meal  --  " And so on , through the pimento and anchovies and into the roast itself . All 1 had to do really was shut up ; we would then have been bathed in a silence that could probably have been no more destructive of pleasure than was my banal chatter . To make matters worse  --  to make my Martha brassier  --  Libby that day was the child saint about to be lifted onto the cross . There was even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martyred air . She was buttoned up to her white throat in a pale green cardigan sweater whose sleeves reached nearly into the palms of her hands ; and her hands were just small half-closed fists in her lap . Every time a serving dish was passed to Paul he would lean over to ask Libby if she would have some . If she shook her head , he urged half a spoonful on her anyway , whispering words I could n't hear into those ears of hers , which stuck poignantly out just where the hair was pulled back above them . If she parted her unpainted lips and consented to be fed , he would croon fine , goodp310and arrange a portion of food for her on her plate . His behavior engaged Martha instantly , and the attention she showed him was almost embarrassing in its openness . After a while she looked to me not so much disgusted  --  though there was that in it all right  --  as offended by this demonstraton of nutritional billing and cooing . I had never seen Paul so solicitous toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , had I not my own private source of uneasiness sitting directly in the center of the table  --  the roast . When it appeared and I had sunk my knife down into its pink center , a new wave of silence , deeper and more significant , went around the table ( granted , this may have been my imagination again ) . It was as though a particularly gross display of wealth had been flaunted ; we were about to dine on some mysterious incarnation of rubies and gold . Then I opened a bottle of Gevrey Chambertin ( 1951 ) and with the classy thhhppp of the cork , we were all reminded once again of the superfluity that characterized my particular sojourn on this earth . In short , I felt that Paul and Libby  --  in different degrees , for different reasons  --  resented me for Martha 's gaudy voluptuousness and for the meal as well . I told myself that they would never understandmy life , and that I should n't allow them to upset me . But then I thought that if all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was perhaps I myself who would never understand it . When the children came in to be appreciated in their clean pajamas , they were introduced to the guests . " And this is Cynthia , " I said , " and this is Mark . " Markie immediately went for Martha ; Cynthia said , " How do you do ? " " How do you do ? " Paul said . Libby looked up from her food  --  in which she had all of a sudden taken an interest  --  but only for a second . She had already returned to separating something on her plate when she commented , " Are n't they nice . " Martha ignored the remark , though not the person who had made it ; she glared at Libby , then , taking a hand of each of her children , said , " Good night , dears . " " You going to come kiss us good night ? " Mark asked . " As soon as dinner is over , " Martha said . " You go off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Markie asked me . They left , Cynthia turning at the door to say that it had been ap311pleasure to meet the Herzes ; she skipped off , her behind like a little piece of fruit , and nobody at the table seemed charmed . We ate in silence until at last Paul asked Martha how old they were , and she did n't answer . " Cynthia is seven , " I said , " and Mark is  --  how old , Martha ? Four ? " I passed the information on to Paul . " Four , " I said . " Look , would anyone care for more meat ? " " No , thank you , " Paul said . " How about some wine , Libby ? " I asked . She shook her head . Paul said , " She ca n't drink too much alcohol . " Some few minutes later , Paul said , " We 've had a very tiring day . You 'll have to excuse us . " I thought for a moment they were going to get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , for his wife 's silence . I suppose he never felt a need to apologize for his own . " That 's all right , " Martha said . " I 'm tired myself . " " Do you know ? " I rushed in . " It 's very interesting about this wine . Now 1951 was supposedly a good year , so I procured  --  " Procured ? Bought , damn it , bought ! I babbled on , explaining how I had come to purchase the wine , while Martha began making offerings of food to Libby , calling her Mrs. Herz . Paul sat listening so silently to what I said that I went on and on and on , waiting as it were for some signal from him that I had spoken enough and could stop . But it was like sending one 's voice down a well . When we had finally finished the one bottle of wine  --  which everyone had been sipping parsimoniously  --  I ran off to the kitchen to get the other . I returned to the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa and Martha had begun to clear the table . " We 'll have coffee over there , " she said , carrying the dishes away . I sat down in a sling chair opposite the Herzes . Libby had picked up a book from the sofa . " It 's a very funny book , " I said . " Martha reads the children a little every night , and they laugh . . . " Libby set it down . " That must be nice . " " Yes , " I said . And I thought , Then why did you come ? Why did you accept my invitation ? Why wo n't you let this be ended !  |p312Why  wo n't I ? The three of us sat facing one another , and the gloom came rolling in . I said , " Excuse me , I better go say good night to the chil-dren . " In the kitchen Martha was standing over the stove , fiddling with her beads and waiting for the coffee to be ready . " Come on , " I whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll be in in a minute . " I put my hands on her bare arms , and she moved away . " Hurry up , will you ? " I said . " Nobody 's willing to say anything . Everyone 's a little stiff . " " Oh , just a little . " " Why did you have to rush them away from the table ? " " They were n't eating anything , what was the difference ? " " I was going to open another bottle of wine . " " They were n't drinking either . " " Well , I 'm going to bring in the Armagnac , " I said , " the hell with it . " " What ! " " The Armagnac . What 's the matter ? " " Nothing . " " Do n't tell me nothing  --  what 's the matter now ? " " That Armagnac happens to date from before I saw your smiling face . " " Martha , we 'll all die out there . " " So we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted some why did n't you think to buy it this afternoon ? " " Because you 've hardly started the bottle that 's here . What 's gotten into you ? " " Do n't people drink beer any more ? " " Look , 1 ' 11 give you a check for seven dollars ! Be quiet ! " " You and your checks . " She turned back to the coffee . " I savednickles and dimes , and bought that as a special gift for myself , butthe hell with it , just take the stuff and pour  --  " " This is some party ! This is marvelous ! Are you coming back in there tonight or are n't you ? " " I 'll be in , " she mumbled . " Just go ahead . " " Well , I 'm taking the Armagnac . " And I went back into the living room , choking the bottle around the neck . I poured four glasses of brandy without asking whether anybody wanted some . I sat back with my glass , sipped from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in order to say something  --  " How 's the adoptiongoing ? " Paul turned immediately to Libby , who turned to him . He said , " I mentioned it to Gabe , you know . " He looked back to me , and I felt no need to apologize ; since the beginning of the evening surely it was I who had been the most burdened member of our party . We stared , Paul and I , wordlessly at one another while Libby said , " Oh did you ? " " I thought he would like to know , " he said . Libby looked down into her lap . I said , " I think it 's a fine idea , Libby . " " What is ? " The question came from Martha , who had entered the room with a trayful of coffee cups . Apparently she had decided to make an effort to be gracious ; it was simply the wrong moment to have chosen . " Nothing , " I said , leaning back . " I 'm sorry I interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have seen it too . " Libby and I are adopting a baby , " he said . " That 's all . " " Oh yes ? " She looked at Libby , and for the first time since the Herzes ' arrival , she smiled . " A boy or a girl ? " The question had an astonishing effect upon Libby at first ; she seemed frightened , then insulted . Paul said , " We do n't know yet . We 're still in the inquiring stage . " Martha set down the tray and poured the coffee . Libby looked over to me . " We have to adopt a Jewish baby anyway , " she said . " Yes ? I did n't know . " " The Catholic orphanages arc crawling with kids , " explained Libby in an emotionless voice , " but that does n't help us . With the Jewish agencies there 's over a three-year waiting list . Then we 're a mixed marriage as far as anybody 's concerned . " " But you converted  --  " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did not press for more information ; Martha sat down and the four of us drank our coffee . Paul said , " You see , today we called long distance to New York . Thinking we could work something out with an agency there . " He stopped explaining , and what was left unsaid was clear enough from the look on his face . Martha said to him , " That 's too bad . " " It 'll work out , " he assured her.  | " Oh sure , " Libby said . Some moments later , Libby spoke again . When her mouth opened the words that came out were connected to none that had previously been spoken in the room . Her body was lifeless and her voice vacant , and it seemed that she might say just about anything . This girl had aroused numerous emotions in me in the past , but never before had she made me feel as I did now  --  afraid . Looking at me again , she said , " Paul was called in to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband said . " That Spigliano , " she said , " is really going to try to get him fired . " " You 're kidding , " I said . " What happened ? " " Nothing . " Paul inclined his head toward his cup after he had spoken , so that his face was in shadows . " I ran into the Dean , " he said softly , " I was n't called in anywhere , Libby . I just ran into him . " " You said he as much as told you they were n't happy with you . " " Libby 's exaggerating , " Paul said . " Mommy ! " We all looked toward the doorway , where Cynthia stood , rubbing her eyes . " What 's the matter , honey ? " Martha said , getting up . Cynthia 's eyes landed on each of us in turn . " You 're all talking too loud . I ca n't sleep . " Martha set down her cup . " We 're hardly talking at all , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libby extended her neck its full length . " Maybe we had better go . I do n't want to wake up anybody who 's trying to sleep . " " Libby , Paul  --  please stay . Let 's not run off . Why do n't we all relax , " I suggested , and went off to the kitchen . The door to the back porch was ajar , and Martha stood in the opening leaning against the wall and looking outside . " Martha , " I said , coming up to her and feeling the cold from outside , " what the hell is going on here ? I invited them over , you invited them over . Let 's not throw them out . I feel as though I 'm in the middle of an earthquake . Let 's all at least try to be civil . Let 's get through this thing like human beings . " " Fin all right , " she said . " Do n't mind Libby .

Tell me what the trouble is . " " Married people depress me , " she said , not turning . " I thought it was divorced people . " " Why do n't you go back into the living room and entertain your friends ? " And I went , but before I had even sat down again , Libby said to me , " I 've been saying something ought to be done about that John Spigliano . Somebody should hit him in the jaw . " " He 's a pain in the ass , Libby , " I said , making a hopeless gesture , " nobody will argue that . There 's really nobody who can stand him . But you 've really only got to ignore him . " " Suppose , " she said , " you have principles . " I smiled . " Still ignore him . " " Well , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried now to ignore her . I looked over at her husband , who was leaning back against the sofa , his face marked slightly by a frown . " It is n't a matter of me , Libby , " I said , " it 's simply the most sensible thing to do . " Paul leaned forward . " Oh but , Jesus , the circular symbols in Toni Sawyer . " He looked to Libby , who nodded in agreement . " What incredible horseshit , " said Paul . " Of course , " I told him . " I know . " " Then , " said Libby , no longer in a flat voice , " why do n't you say something ? " I was puzzled for a moment , until I imagined again all the conversations that this couple  --  my old Libby  --  must have had about me . " Look , Libby , I was through all this last year . I shared your feelings exactly . But the best thing is to ignore Spigliano and do your job . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reading , " she said . " So ? " I answered . " That does n't prove anything here or there . " " It proves something , " she said . " Oh hell , Libby , you did n't have to come here if you did n't want to . I was led to believe it was so awful in Reading . " " Nobody 's blaming you , " Paul said now . " Well , " I replied , " is n't that nice . " " Actually , we were probably better off in Reading , " Libby said , " where there were n't all these phoney and ambitious people . " " Well , you could have chosen to stay there . "  |p316Paul  was standing . " Libby 's not feeling well , Gabe  --  " " Oh balls , " I said , standing now myself , " Libby 's never feeling well . " " I do n't think there 's any need for that kind of remark , " he said , growing fierce . " There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got some appreciation of generosity  --  " " I told you Libby 's not feeling well  --  " " Well , I 'm talking to both of you . " Suddenly Martha was in the room . " Could all of you stop shouting ! Could my kids get some sleep , please ! " Libby stood up and faced her . " We 're going , Mrs. Reganhart . " " Yes , " Paul said , taking his wife 's elbow . " I think we 'd better . " I took a walk that night , by myself . I pulled up my collar and went all the way down to the lake , where the waters were behaving like an ocean , breaking onto the dark rock barrier , then rushing out with the sound of violent tugging . I could not distinguish where the black water ended and where the black sky began . What I saw  --  actually , what I could not see  --  frightened me , but I hung on as long as I could , looking straight out into it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and leave me a less cautious man . Finally I broke away and dashed across the deserted park and onto the lighted streets . Walking back to Martha 's apartment very slowly , I did not do a great deal of thinking because I could not figure out what to think about . The table had been cleared and pushed back to the wall ; the coffee cups , brandy glasses , and bottle had all been put away . I turned off the hall light and in the bedroom got into my pajamas , while Martha lay there with her eyes open , smoking . The bedside lamp was on , but her gaze was focused only on the smoke that rose above her head . I sat down by the window , pushed back a corner of the shade , and peered outside . I said , " What a night . " Martha only pushed herself up a little , as though my remark had caused her some postural discomfort . Her hair was still down over her shoulders , and from time to time her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was stupid of me to have chosen to invite those people , " Ip317said . " I should surely have realized what was going to happen beforehand . " She said nothing . " I do n't know why I felt the necessity to extend something that is really quite over . I should never  --  " " Gabe , " she said , " we have to do something about the money situation . " I rose , and I paced until I could contain myself . " I told you , " I said , " that I 'll pay for that bottle . If you want , 1 'll make out a check right now . Or give you cash , if you object so strenuously to my checks . " " What about the groceries ? " " Oh hell ! " She went on smoking in that contemplative , bitchy , distracted way . " What 's come over you ? " I asked . " What did I say ? We 've been through all this , over and over it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem , and I 'm willing to work it out . But what is it you want me to do , Martha , pay for everything ? Is that what you think will work better ? Are you sure about that ? " " Well , I prepare the food , " she said . " You do n't pay for that . The gas I cook with I happen to pay for . The same goes for the electric lights in the kitchen . Be reasonable , please . " I leaned toward her over the foot of the bed . " You 're kidding me or something , are n't you ? Look at me  --  are n't you ? What do you want me to do  --  hire you as a cook ? " " You treat me like one , why not ? " " Do I ? Look at me , damn it ! Do I ? Do you think , " I demanded , " I 'd hire a cook with two kids ? " She pushed her cigarette into the ash tray beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is working out . " I tried deep breathing  --  a metaphoric way , I suppose , of pumping up the will . " Martha , if you 're willing , we ought to wait until tomorrow . We 'll both feel more ourselves in the morning . This has been a bad day from the start . The money mix-up , and Theresa , and the Herzes . Paul Herz is a strange fellow , impossible to get to , and Libby  --  Libby 's very tough to figure out . " " Not so tough . " " Maybe not . I suppose she got very screwed up seeing your kids . Two handsome children getting ready for bed , Cynthia 's book . . . It probably upset her . " " Those two handsome children seem to have the remarkable ability of upsetting everybody . "  | " I ca n't be responsible for her , Martha . " I went back to the window and found myself staring into the drawn shade . " That 's your type though , is n't it ? " Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Christ , why do n't you go to sleep and take your rotten temper with you . " " What  --  did you have an affair with her ? Is that what she was up to with all that pecking away at you ? Why did n't she look at me , I 'd like to know ? Ca n't anybody talk directly to me ? Am I just the new lay  --  do you do this often , old man , so everybody 's in on it except the dumb blowsy mistress herself ? " " I 'm going to turn the light off . You 're not jealous , which you know , and you 're not making sense . I do n't go for these midnight accusations . " " You do n't really dig us big fat Nordic slobs , though , do you ? " I looked at her . " I 'm crazy about fat Nordic slobs , as a matter of fact . " I went over and switched off the bedside light , but then I could not bring myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge . " This just is n't working out , " she said . " What is n't working out ? " " Cynthia is very upset . " " Cynthia was upset before I got here . " " Not the same way . " " All right then , " I said , rising . " Then I 'll move out . We 'll break it off . This is ridiculous , Martha . What is it you want anyway ? " " I do n't want you to move out ! " she said . " Then what do you want ? " Suddenly she had flipped on the light and was squatting on the blanket . Her nightgown was hiked up to her knees upon which were planted her fists . " Stop raising your voice ! " she demanded . " Everybodyjust hates for those kids to get some sleep ! What do you mean you ' ! l move out ? What do you think this is , a hotel ? You 'll move in one week and out the next ? I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ! " " Why did n't you think about your kids when I moved in ? " " Why did n't you ? " " I did , " I said . " I thought about it plenty ! " " Well then , keep thinking about them , buddy . Do n't be so fast to pack your bags . " Her hair had fallen over her face , and she shook it back , showing a face puffy with rage . She stood up , violentlyp319grabbed a cigarette from the night table , and lit it . She began to tramp around the room , all her pounds and inches coming down through her bare feet onto the floor . She puffed at the cigarette , givingno thought to the flutter of ashes onto her nightgown . I said nothing for several minutes . Then calmly : " You were the one who said it was n't working out , Martha . Not me . I came back here tonight prepared to forget that stupid Armagnac fuss , dedicated to barreling through this miserable night , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The hell I did , " she said . " Ca n't you remember from one minuteto the next ? Nobody told you to leave  --  you volunteered to pack your bags . " " And what do you expect somebody to do if you tell them a hundred times that it is n't working out ? Do n't you think tonight 's been a mess and a trial for me too ? Do you think you can just go around telling people it is n't working out and that they 're going to stand there ? What a night ! What a day ! You , that lousy Armagnac , Theresa whatever the hell her name is " Haug . And that 's my affair , not yours . " " That 's fine with me . Frankly I 'm sick of other people 's troubles . Libby Herz , sitting there with those brooding sullen eyes , and why ? Because I did n't steal her away from Paul back in Iowa ? Well , do n't look at me as though I 'm nuts  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep up with what certain people want of me . As a matter of fact I did n't sleep with her , Martha , and I did n't have an affair , though one night about three or four years ago , I do n't even rememberany more , I kissed her . I admit to the crime : I kissed the girl . But I never got her down in bed  --  though you might want to know it crossed my mind . I do n't have a pure and rarefied soul , and I 'm not without base instincts -- but I 'll also tell you that I did n't do it , and that 's a fact . But you see , now apparently she wanted me to . I was supposed to come along and rescue her ! " Martha looked immeasurably skeptical . " Why did n't you ? " " Because she was married to her husband , Martha . To that big skinny silent prick , Paul . " " I see . " " You do n't see anything . For some reason that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coward . I 've been going around for years thinking I acted honorably , and now it 's my fault I did n't put it to her . " " Nobody said that . "  | " Well , I 'm no social worker . I 'm tired of meddling in people 's lives ! " " It is n't meddling , I should n't think , when people are in trouble . " " What is it you want me to come out for , adultery ? " " Do n't sound moralistic , please . Not you . The minute you see a stray female you take her to the hardware store to have duplicate keys made to her apartment . " " That 's right . I have no feelings . It was heartless of me to have you cook a roast for dinner , because it made the Herzes feel shame and dismay . I should n't have talked about the wine , because that made Herz unhappy too . I can assure you he 's home now hating my guts for that damn roast beef . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " I paid half ! " " We should have had smelts then ! Smelts and stale bread and , I do n't know  --  orange pop ! And you should n't have worn those jazzy gypsy clothes either  --  you should have worn something gray and washed-out , something with a rip in it . " " I 've got plenty of washed-out numbers with rips in them , thank you . " " Ah , do n't start in on me with the poverty business , Martha , because I 'm not in a charitable mood . " " Poverty hell . I 'm only asking you to pay your way . " " Weil , what is it  --  do you want me to leave a ten-dollar bill on the dresser every morning ? Is that what 's going on here ? " She turned and walked away at last , her head back , dragging on her cigarette . " Watch yourself , Gabe . Please watch yourself . I 'm not a stone wall . " " I 'm sorry . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is  --  let 's assume that ! " " And maybe you ought to stop raising your voice too . Mark gets up and peeks in the door enough as it is . " " What can I do about that ? " she said . " I do n't know . " " I do n't either . The child 's interested . He has a natural curiosity . He never had so many doors closed in his face before . We ought to at least have given him a little breaking-in period . " " Come on , Martha , will you  --  you choose to close the door as much as I do . Suddenly even sex looks one-sided to you . Please do n't start switching it around so that I 'm responsible for any confusions your kids might have . I have n't been here long enough . I 'm not Dick Reganhart . I did n't do it . Just as it 's my fault Libby 's kidneys wentp321bad on her , as though I have something to do with the fact that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed to me ? Jewish girls do n't get knocked up as often  --  what are we all supposed to do about that ! " Martha blew out a mouthful of smoke before she 'd even had a chance to inhale it . " And what 's that supposed to mean , Stonewall ? " " What supposed to mean ? " " You think it was easy quitting school , do you ? You think it was easy marrying him ? When that prissy little minister pronounced us abstract expressionist and wife I saw the whole black future , and kept my mouth shut . I got knocked up all right , but I acted like a woman about it . I 'm glad I had Cynthia . She 's a fine child , a fine lovely bright child , even if it takes her a year to warm up to you . Ten years ! What do you think she is , a chameleon ? She 's loyal to her father  --  whichhappens to be admirable . She happens to be an admirablechild , and do n't you forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and Dick , Martha , and I 'm sorry if you misunderstood . " " Well , you sure as hell go out of your way not to mean anything . I do n't have such a lousy record , you know . I had that child , I did n't have it scraped down some drain somewhere , back in some dark alley . And then I woke up one morning and that son of a bitch was on top of me again , and I did n't have an abortion then either . These are lives , for God 's sake . I love those kids . I 'm glad I 've got them , overwhelmingly glad . I work nights and I hate it you do n't /mote how I hate it . But I 'm glad I 've got those kids . They 're . vomeihing , damn it . At least they do n't go packing their bags all the time . Men are a great big pain in the ass . Somebody ought to take all their luggageaway and burn it . Then where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my friend  --  nobody 's got any any more . All they 've got is suitcases ! And stay the hell away from me with your big tit-holding hands  --  I have a right to cry . Do n't soothe me , damn it ! " She sat down in the chair by the window , and without covering her face , she wept . " Martha , hang on . Try to hang on . Somehow Theresa Haug , the Herzes  --  " " Oh Gabe , " she wept , " the hell with Theresa Haug . The hell with all that Armagnac . I want you to marry me or give me up . I 'm too old to screw around like this . "  |p322The  first knowledge she had that day was that their room was swelling with a gleaming gray January light , but she kept her eyes closed to it and she waited . Eyes closed there was no crippled chest of drawers across the way , no half-painted dresser , no smelly rug rolled up in the corner , no curled paint petals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the knowledge that it was morning , a new day , and with it all the possibilities . Some mornings he touched her . Most mornings she touched him and then he touched her . This morning she was willing to wait . She would wait . She made a hmmm sound to let him know she was awake . But she sensed nothing new against her skin , nothing but sheets and blanket and the frail sun . She rolled over , making another sound , a slow moan of lust and comfort , a request for a simple pleasure . She continued to keep her eyes closed . Then she thought ( after a decent interval ) : There are compromisesto be made in life . One ca n't expect everything . He is a faithful , hard-working , dear , terribly talented , intelligent , hard-luck man . It is n't his fault . . . She moved her head an inch closer to his pillow , and then her whole body , but casually , as though she were only being tossed toward him by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face . Good . She had to go all the way to the Near North Side and at least it would n't be miserably cold . If , however , he touched her , if his mouth slid over her breasts , if his body pressed her down , then she would not have to go at all . She did n't want to really , even if it was sunny . He need only reach out . . . But the compromises  --  she must compromise a little . One must begin to , certainly , at twenty-five . One could n't go through life whiningand demanding , day in and day out . She knew certain things about herself that she did not like : she cried too much ; she was envious , she was always sick  --  she was a hopeless hypochondriac , in fact . She knew she had the wrong values . She thought about money all the time . She thought about nice clothes . She thought about nice furniture . She had always imagined that when she was married she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spode . The word , like sun on the skin , warmed her , had a dreamy happy glow about it  --  she would be married , and her husband would be tall ( as he was ) , and he would be kind and soft-spoken and strong and full of integrity ( as he was ) , and dark ( as he was ) , and there would be a long dinner table with a white cloth and candles , and the Spode , and weekend guests to whom she would call out , " Extra bath towels are in the linen closet just outside your room , " and beyond the kitchen would be a garden of her own , with chrysanthemums and nasturtiums and petunias and fresh herbs , which she would cut with scissors for their salad . In the early evenings , when her husband had turned off the lamp in his study ( and he did have a study , and in it he was writing a book ) , she would take him out through the kitchen door into the garden , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would hold hands and smell her flowers . . . But at the age of twenty-five one had to begin to understand about compromise . Though she was not proud of herself for very many things ( she would have to admit that too when she went downtown : that she was not proud of herself , which made her feel terrible ) still she might have reason to become proud were she able to learn to compromise , and to like it . Yes , the second half as well , for surely if one did n't like it , if one could n't stand it . . . But one must stand it . And it was simple . She had only to take it upon herself to move an inch and anotherinch and then  --  her eyes still closed  --  another inch and one more , and now reach out with her fingers , and now lay her hand , softly , lovingly . . . He was not there . She opened her eyes . No Paul . Only his pajamas lying on the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! Make love to me ! I 'll make breakfast ! To the sun , filtering through the grimy windows , she said , " Why ca n't he just kiss me on the lips ? " She got out of bed , thinking : I want everything . Over her nightgown she put on a robe , the same blue flannelp324one her parents had given her when she 'd gone off to Cornell ages ago . In the kitchen he was standing over the stove , waiting for the coffee ; he was already dressed in his suit and tie , and his briefcase was on a chair . The table was set neatly for two , knife on the right , fork on the left . This morning he had cut her orange in quarters and there were two pills beside her bread plate . Dutiful man , he had even folded the paper napkins in half . She did not know of any other husbandwho so served his wife . He had always worked so hard  --  at first , before their marriage , for himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then after their marriage for the two of them . But from the back she saw that his shoulders were still unbent . She came up behind him on her toes and put her arms around his spindly body , her face in the faintly odorous material of his jacket . For some reason their closets smelled the way closets might in which very old maids kept their belongings . And there was nothing to be done about it ; she had already tried air-wick and cologne and moth spray , but apparentlyit was something in the very plaster of the house . Paul jumped . " Oh Jesus  --  you scared me . " " I 'm sorry . Good morning . It 's me  --  sunshine . " She intended her merry words to be at once winning and self-critical , a reference to the night before . " Honey , please put on slippers , " Paul said . " The floors are cold . " That simple remark of his almost drove her mad . " Good morning , though . . . first . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his eyes and found nothing there to make her doubt that he was a generous man . And she loved him ! He was so much more adult and genuine , more in contact with life 's realities , than she could ever hope to be . " Please , " he said , kissing her above the eye , when she lingered beside him , " go put on slippers . I 've got a class in half an hour . " " Yes , " she said ; she fled toward the hall on her toes , and then she turned , and with her face lifted , with her heart beating , she said , " Paul , is n't it a wonderful day ? It 's sunny for a change . It seems like a very significant day  --  " That was as much as she could manage to tell him . She went into their bedroom and from beneath the dresser kicked out her slippers . While she was there she thought she would quickly make the bed . It will please him to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room orderly , if not beautiful . But the wholep325day was before her , no job to go to any longer , no night classes to prepare for , nothing she really had to read , so it might even he a good thing to save the bed for a little later in the morning . She could begin painting those chairs in the kitchen  --  then she remembered she had n't the whole day after all . She had to go downtown . She ran into the kitchen then to be near her husband . If anything significant was going to happen today , it was going to have to happen between them , and in less than thirty minutes . There was no time to waste making beds or worrying over painting chairs . Paint would n't make them look any better anyway . There was no way of cheering this place up . Only Paul . But back in the kitchen she could not think what he could really do or say that she should allow to dissuade her from what she had planned . Her decision had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dialing the number one minute and hanging up the next . She would not permit herself to be tricked by a pleasant breakfast ; she would n't let him get away with that . It was n't as though all their troubles had begun yesterday . She remembered yesterday  --  specifically , the dinner of the night before . Paul had said nothing all the way home , though she knew he had disapproved of her behavior . Wherever they went lately she wound up arguing with people . But it was not her fault ! Everyone else had been awful  --  that son of a bitch Gabe , that woman . . . But what had they done ? What had they said to her ? Why did she hate people ? She would have to admit that too when she went downtown  --  that she could n't control her responses , that out of the clear blue sky she began to hate people . " I think I 'm going to go out this afternoon , " Libby said , picking at her orange . " Just dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I 'm going ? " " Out . For a walk . . . " he said . " I thought you said you were going out . " " If you 're not interested . . . " " Libby , do n't be petulant first thing in the morning . " " Well , do n't be angry at me for last night . " " Who said anything about last night ? " " That 's the whole think you wo n't even bring it up . Well , I did n't behave so badly , and do n't think I did . " " That 's over and done with . You were provoked . That 's all right . That 's finished . "  |p326She  did not then ask him who had provoked her ; she just began cloudily to accept that she had been . " Where are you going ? " he asked . " When ? " Now she was petulant , perhaps because she no longer considered it necessary for her to feel guilty about last night . She saw Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going out , and then I did n't ask you where , you remember . . . so now where is it you 're going ? " " Just out . For a walk . " Paul closed his eyes , and touched his palms together , as though he were praying . " Look "  --  his eyes opened  --  " you ca n't allow yourself to get too upset . We 're doing all we can . " " I do n't even know what you 're talking about . " " That adoption business is what I 'm talking about . It seems confused now and a little hopeless . But it wo n't be . Things will get sorted out . We 've only just begun  --  you ca n't allow it to get to you so soon . " " I was n't even talking about that , " she said , thinking : I was n't even talking about that ! " No , " Paul said , " but anyway , try to relax . I 'm going to call that Greek orphan place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hopeless , but that particular setup sounds so  --  " " We 'll just look into it , " he said sharply . Adopting a baby had been her idea in the first place , had n't it ? She could no longer keep perfectly straight in her mind who had said and done what . " Okay , " she said . " And the Jewish agency is going to send somebody next week . " " What good will that do ? " " Libby , it 's an interview . It 's part of adopting a baby . " " Other people just get pregnant  --  " " Forget other people ! " " Do n't shout at me . " " I do n't shout at you . " Not outside you do n't , " she said bitterly . " If I made you angry last night , why did n't you shout at me there ? Why do you only quarrel with me at home ? " " You 're not making any sense . " " Well . . . " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some simple fact . " Well , that Jewish agency , I do n't see whatp327good it is anyway . They have a three-year waiting list . Who can wait three years ? I could have had a baby a long time ago  --  " " That 's enough . " " Well , I could have . " " So you could have , " he said , raising his hands , then dropping them . And how bald he had become , she thought , since that time I could have had my baby . How old . She felt suddenly as though they had been married a hundred years . A harsh laugh rang in her cars , and it was only herself laughing to think that it had not even been the abortion that had knocked out her reproductive powers  --  just her own two kidneys . How much easier for her if it had been something Paul had put his hands to , or that doctor , or her parents . Anyone . But it was only what had always lived inside her . How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidneys . Why does n't he just leave me ? But he , unlike her , had no illusions ; she knew him to be too good and too patient . She was the nut in the family , and he was the one with his hands full . She let that serve as an accurate description of their life . " Paul , I wo n't be falsely pessimistic if you wo n't be falsely opti-mistic . " " It 's not being falsely optimistic to say that we 'll work something out . Besides , the waiting list is only two years . " " No , " she said , nodding , " that 's not falsely optimistic . People adopt babies . . . "  --  " Why do n't you go downtown , Libby ? Why do n't you go to the Art Institute today ? It 's a beautiful day . Get out . Just put on that littletan hat  --  " " It 's a beautiful day , I do n't need a hat . " He set down his coffee cup as though suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked pretty in that hat . " He left it at that . She was crushed for having crushed him , especially when he had only been suggesting that she was pretty . Still , if he found her so damned attractive . . . Everything between them was hopelessly confused . " I thought I would go downtown . " He rose . " Fine . " " So I probably wo n't be here when you get back . "  |p328He  only leaned down and finished the last of his coffee . " Do n't you want to talk about last night ? " she said . " I do n't think so . " What she wanted to ask him was who had provoked her . Often when she tried to puzzle out the circumstances of her life , her mind was a blank . Last night seemed beyond understanding , and yet it was probably so simple . " 1 behaved rudely  --  " she began . " Everybody behaved badly . Should n't we leave it at that ? " " I guess so . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink , on top of the lunch dishes from the day before . In the bedroom she decided once again to save the bedmaking until later . Her appointment was not until one , so there was plenty of time . She sat down gingerly upon the sofa in the living room . She still had trouble easing her head back onto the pillows , though she had brushed and brushed them with a whisk broom and been over them many times with a damp sponge . The trouble with their furniture was that it had all been bought one afternoon at Catholic Salvage , a place she could not forget . How Paul had discovered it she still did not know , but one day after they had found the apartment , a bleak but moderately priced four rooms on Drexel , they had taken a bus , and then changed to another bus , to the brick warehouse on South Michigan . They had been the only two white people there  --  except in the first floor clothing section , where two spinsters , with skin the color and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of secondhandunderwear , fingering and discarding numerous foundation garments . They had already started up the metal stairs to the furniture section when Paul had turned and gone back down to a pipe rack he had spotted in men 's wear ; it was then Libby had seen the two pathetic old ladies holding up faded corset after faded corset , and then dropping them from crippled fingers back onto the heap . She turned away from them , tears already in her eyes , to see Paul picking out a blue pin-striped suit from amongst a half dozen limp garments strung along the rack . When she saw that the jacket fitted  --  with a little give and take here and there  --  she drew in her breath . Though she knew it did n't matter , that it was what a person was and not what he wore that counted , she nevertheless had begun to pray : " Mary , Mother of God , please do n't let him buy that thing . " And her prayer had been answered . He came clanging up the stairs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits he already had were plenty . They then proceeded up one more flight and around the vast cement floor , where they picked out a kitchen table , four chairs , a desk , a sofa , a bedstead , springs , a mattress , a chest of drawers , a dresser , a mirror , three lamps , and a rug . Marching up another ( light , they chose their dishes and pots and pans . And Paul walked right up and touched everything . In his coat and shoes he had stretched out on half a dozen second-hand mattresses until he had found one with enough life left in it . " Watch out you do n't fall asleep now , son , " said a Negro man who walked by carrying an old console-model radio . Paul looked up and smiled ; Libby smiled too . She was full of admiration for her husband , not to mention wonder : How can he put his head down there ? Ever since grade school she had defended the rights of all men , regardless of race ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she had always spoken up for the underprivileged ( and this even before she had become one herself ) . Yet she stood looking down at her husband and thinking : These mattresses have belonged to colored people . I do n't want any . . . She had only sympathy and tenderness for the sick ( and this , too , dating from beforeshe had joined the ranks ) , but she thought : They have been slept upon by sick people , dying people-I DO N'T WANT ANY ! To her husband , however , she said nothing ; all the while that Paul went around rapping , knocking , testing , she kept her hands in the pockets of her raincoat . She managed to get away without having had to touch anything . " What do you think ? " Paul had asked . " Do we need something else ? " There were blankets and sheets , but she did not choose to mentioneither until they were home . " That seems like everything to me , " she said . " Whatever else we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes  --  if anything turns up . . . " All together what they bought had cost $103 , including the rug , which they never unrolled . " I just do n't like the pattern , " Libby said . " Then why did n't you say so when we were there ? " " Maybe later I 'll get used to it . Ca n't we keep it rolled up a little longer ? I do n't mind the floors , really , if you do n't . " He had let her have her way , though she did not forget that the rug had cost them eight dollars  --  two of her visits to a doctor.  |p330So  with all of this behind her ( the knowledge she had of her weaknesses , the decision to overcome the weaknesses ) , she took the bull by the horns and put her head all the way back onto the sofa . One could come to grips with life if only one used a little reason and a little will power . That was what she admired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robe , with her head held rigidly back ( she was not going to give in to her worst side ) , she watched the sun on the bare floor . What to do until one o'clock ? She could , of course , decide the hell with one o'clock and then go ahead and do anything . But she could go ahead and do anything anyway . She could paint the kitchen chairs . However , still unfinished was the dresser , which she had begun to paint a bright yellow some six weeks ago . It seemed now to have been a mistaken bit of economy to have bought such cheap paint , for instead of being bright and gay  --  brightness and gaiety was what she had told Paul the apartment lacked when she had pleaded with him for money for the paint  --  the piece was coming out a mean , mustardy color because of the stain beneath . Well , she could go ahead and make the bed then . . . No , she would save their bed for last . And not out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those sheets and blankets firmly in her mind when she went downtown . What could she do now ? She could read . But the trouble with her reading was that it was too casual ; it did not satisfy . She had already decided that to remedy the situation she would have to try to read the works of one writer straight through , in chronological order . Then all of another writer , and so on . She planned to start with Faulkner but she did not have the books yet . So this was no morning then to begin that project  --  and to start another book would not make sense , since that would delayher entry into Faulkner when she did get a chance to go over to the library . She could do something practical then . She could make out the grocery list ; she couldShe could write a poem . The idea pleased her . She would write a poem . Why not ? If she could write a poem about the night beforeShe grabbed a yellow pad that was on the floor beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she sat down so excited with her project , that she simply swept her hand across the table , brushing away the breakfast crumbs . She would attend to them later  --  they were unimportant . She had never written a poem before ( though sick and in bed in Reading she had tried a story ) , but the idea of poetry had always stirred her . Toward certain poems she had particu/larly tender feelings . She liked " To His Coy Mistress " and she loved " Ode to a Nightingale , " " Ode to Melancholy , " too . She liked all of Keats , in fact ; at least the ones that were anthologized . She wrote on the pad : Already with thee ! Tender is the nightShe liked Tender Is the Night , which , of course , was n't a poem . She identified with Nicole ; in college she had identified with Rosemary . She would have to read it over again . After Faulkner she would read all of Fitzgerald , even the books she had read before . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She wrote : Come live with me and be my love , And we will all the pleasures prove . Then directly below : The expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action  --  and till action , lust Is perjured , murderous . . . She could not remember the rest . Those few lines had always filled her with a headlong passion , even though she had to admit never having come precisely to grips with the meaning . Still , the sound . . . She wrote , with recollections of her three years of college , with her heart heaving and sighing appropriately .

I am ! Yet what I am none cares or knows , My friends forsake me like a memory lost , I am the self-consumer of my woes . And who had written those last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written them ? She had n't . If she could sculpt , if she could paint , if she could write something ! Anything  --   |p332The  door bell rang . A friend ! She ran to the door , pulling her belt tight around her . All I need is a friend to take my mind off myself and tell me how silly I 'm being . A girl friend with whom I can go shopping and have coffee , in whom I can confide . Why did n't Gabe take up with someoneI could befriend ? Why did he choose her ! She opened the door . It was not a friend ; she had had little opportunity , what with her job , her night classes , and generally watchingout for herself , to make any friends since coming to Chicago . In the doorway was a pleasant-looking fellow of thirty or thirty-five  --  and simply from the thinness of his hair , the fragile swelling of his brown eyes , the narrowness of his body , the neatness of his clothes , she knew he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leery of opening the door all the way in this neighborhood ; Paul cautioned her to peer out over the latch first , but she was not sorry now that she had forgotten . You just could n't distrust everybodyand remain human . His hat in one hand , a briefcase in the other , the fellow asked , " Arc you Mrs. Herz ? " " Yes . " All at once she was feeling solid and necessary ; perhaps it was simply his having called her " Mrs. Herz . " She had , of course , a great talent for spiritual resurrection ; when her fortunes finally changed , she knew they would change overnight . She did not really believe in unhappiness and privation and never would ; it was an opinion , unfortunately , that did not make life any easier for her . " I 'm Marty Rosen , " the young man said . " I wonder if I can come in . I 'm from the Jewish Children 's League . " Her moods came and went in flashes ; now elation faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easygoing and powerful way ; clearly he was not on his first mission for a nonprofit organization . Intimidated , she stepped back and let him in , thinking : One should look over the latch first . Not only was she in her bathrobe ( which had n't been dry-cleaned for two years ) , but she was barefoot . " We did n't think you were coming , " Libby said , " until next week . My husband is n't here . I 'm sorry  --  did n't we get the date right ? We 've been busy , I did n't check the calendar  --  " " That 's all right , " Rosen said . He looked down a moment , and there was nowhere she could possibly stick her feet . Oh they should at least have laid the rug . So what if it was somebody else 's ! Now the floor stretched , bare and cold , clear to the walls . " I will be comingp333around again next week , " Rosen said . " I thought I 'd drop in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " If you 'd have called , my husband might have been able to be here . " " If we can work it out , " Rosen was saying , " we do like to have sort of an informal session anyway , before the formal scheduled meeting  --  " " Oh yes , " said Libby , and her thoughts turned to her bedroom . "  --  see the prospective parents "  --  he smiled  --  " in their natural habitat . " " Definitely , yes . " The whole world was in conspiracy , even against her pettiest plans . " Let 's sit down . Here . " She pointed to the sofa . " Let me take your things . " " I hope I did n't wake you , " he said . " God , no , " she said , realizing it was almost ten . " I 've been up for hours . " After these words were out , they did n't seem right either . With his coat over her arm , she went off to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her slippers as glidingly as she could manage . She walked down the hall , shut the bedroom door , and then , having flung Mr. Rosen 's stuff across a chair , she frantically set about whipping the sheets and blankets into some kind of shape . The clock on the half-painted dresser said not ten o'clock but quarter to eleven . Up for hours ! Still in her nightclothes ! She yanked the sheets , hoisted the mattress ( which seemed to outweigh her ) , and caught her fingernailin the springs . She ran to the other side , tugged on the blankets , but alas , too hard  --  they came slithering over at her and landed on the floor . Oh Christ ! She threw them back on the bed and raced around again  --  but five whole minutes had elapsed . At the dresser she pulled a comb through her hair and came back into the living room , having slammed shut the bedroom door behind her . Mr. Rosen was standing before the Utrillo print ; beside him their books were piled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards for the books . " He did not answer . " That 's Utrillo , " she said . He did not answer again . Of course it was Utrillo . Everybody knew Utrillo  --  that was the trouble . " It 's corny , I suppose , " said Libby . " My husband does n't like the impressionists that much either  --  but we 've had it , I 've had it , since college  --  and we carry it around and I guess we hang it wheneverwe move  --  not that we move that much , but , you know . " Turning , he said , " I suppose you like it , well , for sentimental reasons . " He seemed terribly interested to hear her reply.  | " Well . . . I just like it . Yes , sentiment  --  but aesthetics , of course , too . " She did not know what more to say . They both were smiling . He seemed like a perfectly agreeable man , and there was no reason for her to be giving him so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was going to have to live with for a while longer ; the muscles of her face were working on their own . " Yes , " she said . " And , and this is our apartment . Please , sit down . I 'll make some coffee . " " It 's a very big apartment , " he said , coming back to the sofa . " Spacious . " What did he mean  --  they did n't have enough furniture ? " Well , yes . . . no , " replied Libby . " There 's this room and then down the hall is the kitchen . And my husband 's study  --  " Rosen , having already taken his trouser creases in hand , now rose and asked pleasantly , " May I look around ? " She did not believe that the idea had simply popped into his head . But he was so smooth-faced and soft-spoken and well-groomed that she was not yet prepared to believe him a sneak . He inclined slightly toward her whenever she spoke and , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of sympathetic lean . " Oh do , " Libby said . " You 'll have to excuse us , though ; we were out to dinner last night . Not that we go out to dinner that much  --  however we were out to dinner "  --  they proceeded down the hall and were in the kitchen  --  " and , " she confessed , " I did n't get around to the dishes . . . But , " she said , cognizant of the sympathetic lean , though doing her best to avoid the sympathetic eyes , " this is the kitchen . " " Nice , " he said . " Very nice . " There were the breakfast crumbs on the floor around the table . All she could think to say was , " It needs a paint job , of course . " " Very nice . " He sounded genuine enough . She went on . " We have plenty of hot water , of course , and everything . " " Docs the owner live on the premises ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building live on the premises ? " he asked . " It 's an agency that manages the place , " she said nervously . " I was only wondering . " He walked to the rear of the kitchen , crunching toast particles . Out the back window through which hepaused to look , there was , of course , no green yard . " There wasp335just "  --  he lifted a hand to indicate that it was nothing  --  " a light bulb out in the hallway , coming up . I wondered if the owner . . . " He dwindled off , and again she did n't know what to say . The bulb had been out since their arrival ; she had never even questioned it ; it came with the house . " You see , " Libby said , " there are two Negrofamilies in the building and  --  " And what ! I do n't have anything against Negroes ! But the agency does  --  the agency  --  Why do I keep bringing up Negroes all the time ! " And , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night , you see . My husband 's going to pick one up today . Right now he 's teaching . We do n't like to bother the agency for little things . You know . . . " But she could not tell whether he knew or not ; he was leaning her way , but what of it ? He turned and started back down the hall . Libby shut her eyes . I must stop lying . I must not lie again . He will be able to tell when I lie . They do n't want liars for mothers , and they 're perfectly right . Tell the truth . You have nothing to be ashamed of . " My husband is a writer , aside from being a teacher , " she said , running down the hall and slithering by Rosen , " and this "  --  she turned the knob to Paul 's room , praying  --  " is his study . " Thank God . It was orderly ; though there was not much that could be disordered . In the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further than ten feet from the apartment buildingnext door , there was only a desk and a desk lamp , a chair and a typewriter , and a wastepaper basket . But the window shades were even and all the papers on the desk were piled neatly . God bless Paul . " My husband works in here . " She flipped on the overhead light , but the room seemed to get no brighter ; if anything , it was dingier . But it was n't their fault that the sun could n't get around that way . They had n't constructed the building next door . " He 's writing a novel . " Rosen took quite an interest in that , too . " Oh yes ? That must be some undertaking . " " Well , it 's not finished yet . It is an undertaking , all right . But he 's working on it . He works very hard . However this , " she said quickly , " this , of course , would be the baby 's room . Will be the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we have a baby , this will be  --  " Even while she spoke she was oppressed by the barren feeblenessof the room . Where would a baby sleep ? From what window would the lovely , healthy , natural light fall onto a baby 's cheek ? Where would they get the baby 's crib , Catholic Salvage ?  | " Where will your husband work on his novel then ? " " I "  --  she would n't lie  --  " I do n't know . We have n't talked about it . This has all happened very quickly . Our decision to have a baby . " " Of course . " " Not that we have n't thought about it  --  you see , it 's not a problem . He can work anywhere . The bedroom . Anywhere . I 'll discuss it with him tonight , if you like . " Rosen was quite taken aback ; he made a self-effacing gesture with his hands . " Oh , look , I do n't care . That 's all up to you folks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she liked him for trying to put her at her ease . ( Though that meant he knew about her nervousness ; later he would mull over motives and behavior . ) She had no real reason to be uneasy or overexcited or ashamed . Marty Rosen would n't kill her , would n't insult her , he was n't even that much older than she  --  but what right , damn it , did he have to come unannounced ! That was the trouble ! What kind of business was this natural habitat business ! They have no right to trick people , she was thinking , and then she was opening the door to their own bedroom , and there was the bed , and the disheveled linens , and the half-painted dresser , and there were Paul 's pajamas on the floor . There , in fact , was Rosen 's coat , half on the floor . She closed the door and they went back into the living room . " Actually , " she said , addressing the back of his neat little suit as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write a poem . . . " " Really ? A poem ? " He sat down , and then instantly was leaning forward , his arms on his legs and his hands clasped , smiling . It was as though nothing he had seen up until now meant a thing ; as though there was an entirely different set of rules called into play when the prospective mother turned out to be a poet . " You write , too , do you ? " " Well , " said Libby , " no . " Then she did not so much sit down into their one easy chair as capitulate into it . Why had she told Rosen about the poem ? What did that explain to anybody  --  did writing poetryexcuse crumbs on the floor ? It was the truth , but that was all it was . They may want poets for mothers , she thought , but they sure as hell do n't want slobs . " Well , " said Rosen cheerily , " it 's a nice-sized apartment . " It seemed impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , would you say ? " " Not long , " the girl answered . " A few months . Since October . " Rosen was opening his briefcase . " Do you mind if I take down a few things ? "  | " Oh no , go right ahead . " But her heart sank . " We 're going to paint , of course , as soon as . . . soon . " Stop saying of course ! " When everything 's settled . When I get some time , I 'll begin . " The remark did not serve to make her any less conscious of her bathrobe and slippers . " You see , " she went on , for Rosen had a way of listeningeven when no one was speaking , " I was working . I worked at the University . However I was n't feeling well . Paul said 1 had better quit . " " That 's too bad . Are you better now ? " " I 'm fine . I feel fine  --  " she assured him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have very white skin . " Even as she spoke the white skin turned red . Rosen smiled his smile . " I hope it was n't serious . " " It was n't anything really . I might have gotten quite sick  --  " Why is n't Paul home ? What good is he if he is n't here now ? " I had a kidney condition , " she explained , starting in again . " It 's why the doctors say I should n't have a baby . It would be too strong a risk . You see , I 'm the one who ca n't have a baby . Not my husband . " " Well , there are many many couples that ca n't have babes , believe me . " His remark was probably intended to brace her , but tears came to her eyes when she said , " Is n't that too bad . . . " He took a long sheet of paper from his briefcase and pushed out the tip of a ball point pen . The click sounded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up straight in her chair and waited for the cluestions . But Rosen only jotted some words on the paper . She waited . Finally he glanced up . " Just the number of rooms and so forth , " he said . " Certainly . Go right ahead . I 've just been having "  --  she yawned  --  " my lazy morning , you know  --  " She tried to stretch but stifled the impulse halfway . She certainly did not want for a moment to ap ' ' ear in any way loose or provocative . " Not making the bed or anything , just taking the day off , just doing nothing . With a baby , of course , it would be different . " " Oh yes . " His brow furrowed , even as he wrote . " Children are a responsibility . " " There 's no doubt about that . " And she could not help it  --  she did not care if that was so much simple ass-kissing . At least , at last , she 'd said the right thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right thing and get him out of here , and the next time Paul would be home . There were so many Jewish families wanting babies , and sop338few Jewish babies , and so what if she was obsequious . As long as : one , she did n't lie ; and two , she said the right thing . " They are a responsibility , " she said . " We certainly know that . " " Your husband 's an instructor then , is n't that right , in the Col-lege ? " " He teaches English and he teaches Humanities . " " And he 's got a Ph.D ? " He seemed to take it so for granted  --  was he writing it down already ?  --  thatshe suffered a moment of temptation . " An M.A. He 's working on his Ph.D . Actually , he 's just finishing up on it . He 'll have it very soon , of course . Do n't worry about that . Excuse me  --  I 'm sorry , I do n't mean to sound so instructive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled , sweetly and spontaneously . A second later she thought that she must have charmed him ; at least if he were someone else , if he were Gabe say , he would have been charmed . But this fellow seemed only to become more attentive . " I only meant , " Libby said , " that I think Paul has a splendid career before him . Even if I am his wife . " And did n't that have the ring of truth about it ? Had n't her words conveyed all the respect and admiration she had for Paul , and all the love she still felt for him , and would feel forever ? It had been a nice wifely remark uttered in a nice wifely way  --  why then was n't Rosen moved by it ? Did n't he see what a dedicated , doting , loving mother she would be ? " I 'm sure he has , " Rosen said , and he might just as well have been attesting to a belief in the process of evolution . But one had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could n't expect him to gush and sigh . He must see dozens of families every day and hear dozens of wives attest to their love for their husbands . He could probably even distinguish those who meant it from those who did n't , from those who were no longer quite so sure . She tried to stifle her disappointment , though it was clear to her she probably would not be able to get off so solid a remark again . Rosen had set his paper down now . " And so you just  --  well , live here , " he said , tossing the remark out with a little roll of the hands , " and see your friends , and your husband teaches and writes , and you keep house  --  " " As I said , today is just my lazy day  --  " "  --  and have a normal young people 's life . That 's about it then , would you say ? " " Well  --  " He seemed to have left something out , though she could n't put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it . "  |p339He  nodded . " And you go to the movies , " he said , " and see an occasional play , and have dinner out once in a while , I suppose , and take walks "  --  his hands went round with each activity nmentioned  --  " and try to put a few dollars in the bank , and have little spats , I suppose  --  " She could n't stand it , she was ready to scream . " We read , of course . " Though that was n't precisely what she felt had been omitted , it was something . He did n't seem to mind at all having been interrupted . " Are you interested in reading ? " " Well , yes . We read . " He considered further what she had said ; or perhaps he was only waiting for her to go on . He said finally , " What kind of books do you like best ? Do you like fiction , do you like nonfiction , do you like biography of famous persons , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What kind of books would you say you liked to read ? " " Books . " She became flustered . " All kinds . " He leaned back now . " What books have you read recently ? " To the question , he gave nothing more or less than it had ever had beforein the history of human conversation and its impasses . It was her turn now to wave hands at the air . " God , I ca n't remember . It really slips my mind . " She felt the color of her face changing again . " We 're always reading something though and , well , Faulkner . Of course I read The Sound and die Fury in college , and Light in August , but I 've been planning to read all of Faulkner , you know , chronologically . To get a sense of development . I thought I 'd read all of him , right in a row . . . " His reply was slow in coming ; he might have been waiting for her to break down and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read in the last year . " That sounds like a wonderful project , like a very worth-while project . " In a shabby way she felt relieved . " And your poetry , " he asked , " what kind of poetry do you write ? " " What ? " " Do you write nature poems , do you write , oh I do n't know , rhymes , do you write little jingles ? What kind of poetry would you say you write ? " Her eyes widened . " Well , I 'm sorry , I do n't write poetry , " she said , as though he had stumbled into the wrong house.  | " Oh I 'm sorry , " he said , leaning forward to apologize . " I misun-derstood . " " Ohhhh , " Libby cried . " Oh , just this morning you mean . " Even Rosen seemed relieved ; it was the first indication she had that the interview was wearing him down too . " Yes , " he said , " this morning . Was that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical ? You know , your thoughts and so forth . I do n't mean to be a nuisance , Mrs. Herz , " he said , spreading his fingers over his tie . " I thought we might talk about your interests . I do n't want to pry , and if you  --  " " Oh yes , surely . Poetry , well , certainly , " she said in a light voice . " And the poem this morning , for instance  --  " " Oh that . I did n't know you meant that . That was  --  mostly my thoughts . I guess just a poem , " she said , hating him , " about my thoughts . " " ' That sounds interesting . " He looked down at the floor . " It 's very interesting meeting somebody who writes poetry . Speaking for myself , I think , as a matter of fact , that there 's entirely too much televisionand violence these days , that somebody who writes poetry would be an awfully good influence on a child . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't hate him . She closed her eyes  --  though not the two shiny dark ones that Rosen could see . She closed her eyes , and she was back in that garden , and it was dusk , and her husband was with her , and in her arms was a child to whom she would later , by the crib , recite some of her poetry . " I think so too , " she said. "  --  what makes poetry a fascinating subject , " she heard Rosen saying , " is that people express all kinds of things in it . " " Oh yes , it is fascinating . I 'm very fond of poetry . I like Keats very much , " and she spoke almost passionately now ( as though her vibrancy while discussing verse would make up for the books she could n't remember having read recently ) . " And I like John Donne a great deal too , though I know he 's the vogue , but still , I do . And I like Yeats . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I like some of him , what I know . I suppose they 're mostly anthologized ones , " she confessed , " but they 're awfully good . The worst are full of passionate intensity , the best lack all conviction . ' " A second later she said , " I 'm afraid I 've gotten that backwards , or wrong , but I do like that poem , when I have it in front of me. " - " Hmmmm , " Rosen said , listening even after she had finished.  | " You seem to really be able to commit them to memory . That must be a satisfaction . " " It is . " " And how about your own poems ? I mean  --  would you say they 're , oh I do n't know , happy poems or unhappy poems ? You know , people write all kinds of poems , happy poems , unhappy poems  --  what do you consider yours to be ? " " Happy poems , " said Libby . " Very happy poems . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny circle wiggling into his little coat , he said , " I suppose you know Rabbi Kuvin . " " Rabbi who ? " He was facing her , fastening buttons . " Bernie Kuvin . He 's the rabbi over in the new synagogue . Down by the lake . " She urged up into her face what she hoped was an untroubled look . " No . We do n't . " Rosen put on his hat . " I thought you might know him . " He looked down and over himself , as though he had something more importanton his mind anyway , like whether he was wearing his shoes or not . She understood . " No , no , we do n't go around here to the synagogue . We 're New Yorkers , originally that is  --  we go when we 're in New York . We have a rabbi in New York . Rabbi Lichtman . You 're right , though , " she said , her voice beginning to reflect the quantity and quality of her hopelessness . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " religion is very important  --  " " I do n't know . I suppose it 's up to the individual couple  --  " " Oh no , oh no , " Libby said , and now she was practically pushingthe door shut in his face , and she was weeping . " Oh no , you 're perfectly right , you 're a hundred percent right , religion is very important to a child . But "  --  she shook and shook her tired head  --  " but my husband and I do n't believe a God damn bit of it ! " And the door was closed , only by inches failing to chop off Rosen 's coattails . She did not move away . She merely slid down , right in the draft , right on the cold floor , and oh the hell with it . She sat there with her legs outstretched and her head in her hands . She was crying again . What had she done ? Why ? How could she possibly tell Paul ? Why did she cry all the time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the bed had been made , if only it had n't been for that stupid poetry-writing  --  She had really ruined things now . As far as she could see there was only one thing left to do . Rushing up Michigan Boulevard in the unseasonable sunlight  --  unseasonable for this frostbound city  --  she realized that she was goingto be late . She had gone into Saks with no intention of buying anything ; she had with her only her ten-dollar bill ( accumulated with pennies and nickels and hidden away for just such a crisis ) , and besidesshe knew better . She had simply not wanted to arrive at the officewith fifteen minutes to spare . She did not intend to sit there , perspiring and flushing , her body 's victim . If you show up so very early , it 's probably not too unfair of them to assume that you are weak and needy and pathetically anxious . And she happened to know she was n't . She had been coping with her problems for some time now , and would , if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , until they just resolved themselves . She was by no means the most unhappy person in the world . As a result , she had taken her time looking at sweaters . She had spent several minutes holding up in a mirror a lovely white cashmere with a little tie at the neck . She had even taken off her coat so as to have her waist measured by a salesgirl in Skirts . She had left the store ( stopping for only half a minute to look at a pair of black velveteen slacks ) with the clock showing that it still was n't one o'clock . And even if it had been , she would prefer not to arrive preciselyon the hour . Then they would assume you were a compulsive  --  which was another thing no one was simply going to assume about her . But it was twelve minutes past the hour now , and even if she was n't a compulsive , she was experiencing some of the more characteristicemotions of one . She clutched at her hat  --  which she had worn not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . Havingseriously misjudged the distance , she was still some fifty numbers south of her destination . And it was no good to be this late , no good at all ; in a way it was so aggressive of her ( or defensive ? ) and God , she was n't either ! She was . . . what ? She passed a jewelry store ; a clock in the window said fourteen after . She would miss her appointment . Where would she ever find the courage to make another ? Oh she was pathetically anxious  --  whyp343had n't she just gone ahead and been it ! Why shopping ? Clothes ! Life was falling apart and she had to worry about velveteen slacks  --  and without even the money to buy them ! She would miss her appointment . Then what ? She could leave Paul . It was a mistake to think that he would ever take it upon himself to leave her . It must be she who says goodbye to him . Go away . To where ? She ran as fast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a picture of Freud that hung on the wall beside the doctor 's desk . Dr. Lumin was clean-shaven and accentless . What he had were steamrolled Midwestern vowels , hefty south-Chicago consonants , and a decidedly urban thickness in his speech ; nothing , however , that was European . Not that she had hung all her hopes on something as inconsequential as a bushy beard or a foreign intonation ; nevertheless neither would have shaken her confidence in his wisdom . If anything at all could have made her comfortable it might have been a little bit of an accent . Dr. Lumin leaned across his desk and took her hand . He was a short wide man with oversized head and hands . She had imagined before she met him that he would be tall ; though momentarily disappointed , she was no less intimidated . He could have been a pygmy , and her hand when it touched his would have been no warmer . He gave her a nice meaty handshake and she thought he looked like a butcher . Under his slicked-down brownish hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent most of the day lugging sides of beef in and out of refrigerated compartments . She knew he would n't take any nonsense . " I 'm sorry I 'm late . " There were so many explanations that she did n't give any . " That 's all right . " He settled back into his chair . " I have someonecoming in at two , so we wo n't have a full hour . Why do n't you sit down ? " There was a straight-backed red leather chair facing his desk and a brownish leather couch along the wall . She did not know whether she was supposed to know enough to just go over and lie down on the couch and start right in telling him her problems . . . Who had problems anyway ? She could not think of one  --  except , if she lay down on the couch , should she step out of her shoes first . Her shoulders drooped . " Where ? " she asked finally.  | " Wherever you like , " he said . " You wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " if I just sit for to-day . " He extended one of his hands and said with a mild kind of force , " Why do n't you sit . " Oh , he was nice . A little crabby , but nice . She kept her shoes on and sat down in the straight chair . And then her heart took up a very sturdy , martial rhythm . She looked directly across the desk into a pair of gray and inpenetrable eyes . She had had no intention of becoming evasive in his presence ; not when she had suffered so in making the appointment . But the room was a good deal brighter than she had thought it would be , and on top of her fear there settled a thin icing of shyness . She was alarmed at having all her preconceptions disappointed ; and she was alarmed to think she had had so many preconceptions . She could not remember having actually thought about Dr. Lumin 's height , or the decor of his office ; nevertheless there was a series of small shocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his gold-colored carpet , and particularly in the wide window behind his desk , through which one could see past the boulevard and down to the lake . She had not been expecting to fmd him with his shade raised . The room was virtually ablaze with light . But of course  --  it was only one o'clock . One-twenty . " I stopped off at Saks on the way up . I did n't mean to keep you . " With one of those meat-cutter 's hands , he waved her apology aside . " I 'm interested  --  look , how did you get my name ? For the record . " It was the second time that day that she found herself settled down across from a perfect stranger who felt it necessary to be casual with her . Dr. Lumin leaned back in his swivel chair , so that for a moment it looked as though he 'd just keep on going , and fall backwards , sailing clear through the window . Go ahead , she thought , fall . There goes Lumin . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . With no lessening of her heartbeat , she blushed . It was like livingwith an idiot whose behavior was unpredictable from one moment to the next : what would this body of hers do ten seconds from iiow ? " I heard your name at a party , " she said . " You see , we 've just come to Chicago . A few months ago . So I did n't know anyone . I heard it at a party at the University of Chicago . " She thought the last would make it all more dignified , less accidental . Otherwise he might take her coming to him so arbitrarily as an insult . " My husband teaches at the University of Chicago , " she said . " It says here "  --  the doctor was looking at a card  --  " Victorp345Honingfeld . " His eyes were two nailheads . Would he turn out to be stupid ? Did he read those books on the wall or were they just for public relations ? She wished she could get up and go . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I gave Victor 's name . He 's a colleague of my husband 's . I  --  he mentionedyour name in passing , and I remembered it , and when I thought I might like to  --  try something , I only knew you , so I called . I did n't mean to say that Victor had recommended you . It was just that I heard it  --  " Why go on ? Why bother ? Now she had insulted him professionally , she was sure . He would start off disliking her . " I think , " she said quickly , " I 'm becoming very selfish . " Swinging back in his chair , his head framed in the silver light , he did n't answer . " That 's really my only big problem , I suppose , " said Libby . " Perhaps it 's not even a problem . I suppose you could call it a foible or something along that line . But I thought , if I am too selfish , I 'd like to talk to somebody . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just some sort of passing thing , circumstances you know , not me , well then I wo n't worry about it any more . Do you see ? " " Sure , " he said , fluttering his eyelashes . He tugged undaintily at one of his fleshy ears and looked down in his lap , waiting . All day people had been waiting on her words . She wished she had been born self-reliant . " It 's been very confusing , " she told him . " I suppose moving , a new environment . . . It 's probably a matter of getting used to things . And I 'm just being impatient  --  " Her voiced stopped , though not the rhythmic thudding in her breast . She did n't believe she had Lumin 's attention . She was boring him ; he seemed more interested in his necktie then in her . " Do you want me to lie down ? " she asked , her voice quivering with surrender . His big raw face  --  the sharp bony wedge of nose , the purplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red thing  --  tilted up in a patient , skeptical smile . " Look , come on , stop worrying about me . Worry about yourself , " he said , almost harshly . " So how long have you been in Chicago , you two ? " She was no longer simply nervous ; she was frightened . You two . If Paul were to know what she was doing , it would be his final disappointment . " October we came . " " And your husband 's a teacher ? " " He teaches English at the University . He also writes . " " What ? Books , articles , plays ? "  | " He 's writing a novel now . He 's still only a young man . " " And you , what about yourself ? " " I do n't write , " she said firmly . She was not going to pull her punches this second time . " I do n't do anything . " He did not seem astonished . How could he , with that unexpressivebutcher 's face ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistaketo take your troubles outside your house . You had to figure things out for yourself . How ? " I was working , " she said , " I was secretary to the Dean , and I was going to school , taking some courses at night downtown . But I 've had a serious kidney condition . " " Which kind ? " " Nephritis . " She spoke next as a historian , not a sympathymonger ; she did not want his sympathy . " I almost died , " she said . Lumin moved his head as though he were a clock ticking ; sympathy , whether she wanted it or not . " Oh nasty , a nasty thing . . . " " Yes , " she said . " I think it weakened my condition . Because I get colds , and every stray virus , and since it is really dangerous once you 've had a kidney infection , Paul said I should quit my job . And the doctor , the medical doctor "  --  she regretted instantly having made such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes downtownat night , because of the winter . I suppose I started thinking about myself when I started being sick all the time . I was in bed , and I began to think of myself . Of course , I 'm sure everyone thinks of himself eighty percent of the time . But truly , I was up to about eighty-five . " She looked to see if he had smiled . Was n't anybody going to be charmed today ? Were people simply going to listen ? She wondered if he found her dull  --  not only dull , but stupid . They tried to mask their responses , one expected that ; but perhaps she was no longer the delightful , bubbly girl she knew she once had been . Well , that 's partly why she was here : to somehow get back to what she was . She wanted now to tell him only the truth . " I did become self-concerned , I think , " she said . " Was I happy ? was I this ? was I that ? and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hung on , in a way . Though I suppose what I need is an interest really , something to take my mind off myself . You simply ca n't go around all day saying I just haul an orange , did that make me happy ; I just typed a stencil , did that niakr me happy ; because you only make yourself miserable . " I'lie doctor rocked in his chair ; he placed his hands on his belly , where it disappeared into his trousers like half a tent . " I do n't know , " he mumbled . " What , what does your husband think about all this ? "  |p347Her  glands and pores worked faster even than her mind ; in a moment her body was encased in perspiration . " I do n't understand . " " About your going around all day eating oranges and asking yourself if they make you happy . " " I eat , " she said , smiling , lying , " the oranges privately . " " Ah-hah . " He nodded . She found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So  --  go ahead . How privately ? What privately ? " He seemed suddenly to be having a good time . " It 's very involved , " Libby said . " Complicated . " " I would imagine , " Lumin said , a pleasant light in his eye . " You 've got all those pits to worry about . " Then he was shooting toward her  --  he nearly sprang from his chair . Their faces might as well have been touching , his voice some string she herself had plucked . " Come on , Libby , " Lumin said , " what 's the trouble ? " For the second time that day , the fiftieth that week , she was at the mercy of her tears . " Everything , " she cried . " Every rotten thing . Every rotten despicable thing . Paul 's the trouble  --  he 's just a terrible terrible trouble to me . " She covered her face and for a full five minutes her forehead shook in the palms of her hands . Secretly she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice nor feel upon her shoulders anyone 's hands . When she finally looked up he was still there , a thick fleshy reality , nothing to be charmed , wheedled , begged , tempted , or flirted with . Not Gabe ; not Paul ; not an extension of herself . She pleaded , " Please just psychoanalyze me and straighten me out . I cry so much . " He nodded and he said , " What about Paul ? " She almost rose from her seat . " He never makes love to me ! I get laid once a month ! " Some muscle in her  --  it was her heart  --  suddenlyrelaxed . Though by no means restored to health , she felt somehowunsprung . " Well , " said Lumin , with authority , " everybody 's entitled to get laid more than that . Is this light in your eyes ? " He raised an arm and tapped his nail on the bright pane of glass behind him . " No , no , " she said , and for no apparent reason what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can see the lake . " She tried , however , to put some real effort into pulling herself together . She wanted to stop crying and make sense , but it was the crying that seemed finally to be more to the point than the explanations she began to offer him in the best of faith . " You see , I think I 've been in lovep348with somebody else for a very long time . And it is n't Paul 's fault . Do n't think that . It could n't be . He 's the most honest man , Paul  --  he 's always been terribly good to me . I was a silly college girl , selfconcernedand frivolous and unimportant , and brutally typical , and he was the first person I ever wanted to listen to . I used to go on dates . years ago this is , and never listen  --  just talk . But Paul gave me books to read and he told me thousands of things , and he was  --  well , he saved me really from being like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . His parents have been bastards , perfect bastards . That 's true  --  miserable cruel bastards ! " Though her eyes seemed hardly able to deliver up any more tears , they somehow managed . " Oh honestly , " she said , " my eyeballs are going to fall out of my skull , just roll right on out . Between this and being sick . . . I never imagined everything was going to be like this , believe me . . . " After a while she wiped her face with her fingers . " Is it time ? " she asked . " Is it two ? " Lumin seemed not to hear . " What else ? " " I do n't know . " She sniffed to clear her nose . " Paul  --  " Medical degrees and other official papers hung on either side of Freud 's picture . Lumin 's first name was Arnold . That little bit of information made her not want to go on . But he was waiting . " I 'm not really in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's an old friend , we 've known him since graduate school . And he 's  --  he 's very nice , he 's carefree , he 's full of sympathy  --  " " Is n't Paul ? " " Oh yes , " she said , in what came out like a whine . " Oh so sympathetic . Dr. Lumin , I do n't know what I want . I do n't love Gabe . I really ca n't stand him if you want to know the truth . He 's not for me , he 's not Paul  --  he never could be . Now he 's living with some woman and her two kids . Two of the most charming little children you ever saw , and those two are living together , right in front of them . She 's so vulgar , I do n't know what 's gotten into him . We had dinner there  --  nobody said anything , and there was Gabe with that bitch . " " Why is she such a bitch ? " " Oh "  --  Libby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to know the hitch ? Me . I was . But I knew it would be awful even before we got there . So , God , that did n't make it any easier . " He did not even have to bother ; the next question she asked herself . " I do n't know why . I just thought , why should n't we ? We never go out to dinner , we hardly have been able to go out anywhere  --  and that 's because of me too , and my health . Why should n't we ? Do youp349see ? And besides , I wanted to , " she said . " It 's as simple as that . I mean is n't that still simple  --  to want to ? But then I went ahead and behaved worse than anybody , I know I did . Oh , Gahc was all right  --  even she was all right , in a way . I understand all that . She 's not a bitch probably . She 's probably just a sexpot , good in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her anyway ? Fle 's single , he can do whatever he wants to do . I 'm the one who started the argument . All I do lately is argue with people . And cry . I mean that keeps me pretty busy , you can imagine . " Lumin remained Lumin ; he did n't smile . In fact he frowned . " What do you argue about ? Who are you arguing with ? " She raised two hands to the ceiling . " Everybody , " she said . " Everything . " " Not Paul ? " " Not Paul  --  that 's right , not Paul . For Paul , " she announced . " Everybody 's just frustrating the hell out of him , and it makes me so angry . It makes me so furious ! That John Spigliano ! Gabe . . . Oh I have n't even begun to tell you what 's happened . " " Well , go on . " " What ? " she said helplessly . " Where ? " " Paul . Why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her two fists came hammering down on his desk . " If he was n't , Doctor , oh if they would just leave him alone ! " She fell back , breathless . " Is n't it two ? " At last he gave her a smile . " Almost . " " It must be . I 'm so tired . I have such lousy resistance . . . " " It 's a very tiring thing , this kind of talking , " Lumin said . " Everybodygets tired . " " Doctor , " she said , " can I ask you a question ? " " What ? " " What 's the matter with me ? " " What do you think 's the matter ? " " Please , Dr. Lumin , please do n't pull that stuff . Really , that 'll drive me nuts . " He shook a finger at her . " C'm on , Libby , do n't threaten me . " The finger dropped , and she thought she saw through his smile . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed away . " I 'm nuts already anyway . " For an answer he clasped and unclasped his hands . " Well , I am , " she said . " I 'm cracked as the day is long . " He groaned . " What are you talking about ? Huh ? I 'm not sayingp350you should make light of these problems . These are real problems . Absolutely . Certainly . You 've got every reason to be upset and want to talk to somebody . But "  --  he made a sour face  --  " what 's this cracked business ? How far does it get us ? It does n't tell us a hell of a lot , would you agree ? " She had , of course , heard of transference , and she wondered if it could be beginning so soon . She was beaming at him ; her first friend in Chicago. t " So . . . " he said peacefully . " Really I have n't begun to tell you things . " " Sure , sure . " " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said more softly , with less bravado , " should I come again ? " " If you want to , of course . " He looked at the appointment book on his desk . " How 's the day after tomorrow ? Same time . " " That 's fine . I think that would be perfect . Except  --  " Her heart . which had stopped its pounding earlier , started up again , like a band leaving the field . " How much will it be then ? " " Same as today  --  " " I only brought , " she rushed to explain , " ten dollars . " " We 'll send a bill then . Do n't worry about that . " " It 's more than ten , for today ? " " The usual fee is twenty-five dollars . " " An hour ? " " An hour . " She had never in her life passed out , and that she did n't this time probably indicated that she never would . She lost her breath , voice , vision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright in her chair . " I  --  do n't send a bill to the house . " " I 'd rather you would n't , " Lumin began , a kind of gaseous expressioncrossing his face , " worry about the money . We can talk about that too . " Libby had stood up ; now she sat down . " I think I have to talk about it . " " All right . We 'll talk . " " It 's after two , I think . " " ' That 's all right . " But what she meant was , would he charge for overtime ? " Twenty-live dollars an hour  --  that must be nearly fifty cents a minute . " I ca n't pay twenty-five dollars . " She tried to cry , but could n't . She felt very dry , very tired.  | " Perhaps we can work it out at twenty . " " I ca n't pay twenty . I ca n't pay fifteen . I ca n't pay anything . " " Of course , " said Lumin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nothing . " " I suppose I did . I do n't know . . . " She got up to go . " Please sit down . Sit . " She almost crept back into the chair as though it were a lap . " Do n't you see , it 's all my doctor 's bills in the first place . Do n't you see that ? " He nodded . " Well , I ca n't pay ! " But she could n't cry either . " I ca n't pay ! " " Look , Libby , look here . I 'm giving you an address . You go home , you give it some thought . It 's right here on Michigan Avenue  --  the Institute . They have excellent people , the fee is less . You 'll have an interview  --  " " I married Paul , " she said , dazed , " not Gabe  --  this is ridiculous  --  you 're being ridiculous  --  excuse me , but you 're being  --  " He was writing something . She shouted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the Institute for Psychoanalysis  --  " " Why ca n't I have you ! " He offered her the paper . " You can be interviewed at the Institute , " he said , " and see if they 'll be able to work you in right away . Come on now , " he said , roughly , " why do n't you think about which you might prefer , which might better suit your circumstances . " She stood up . " You do n't even know they 'll take me . " " It 's research and training , so of course , yes , it depends  --  " " I came to you , damn it ! " She reached for the paper he had written on , and threw it to the floor . " I came to you and I told you all this . You listened . You just sat there , listening . And now I have to go tell somebody else all over again . Everything . I came to you  --  I want you ! " He stood up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip her of her force , though not her anger . " Of course , " he said , " one ca n't always have everything one wants  --  " " I do n't want everything ! I want something ! " He did not move , and she would not be intimidated : she had had enough for one day . Quite enough . " I want you , " she said . " Libby  --  " " I 'll jump out the window . " She pointed over his shoulder . " I swear it . "  |p352He  remained where he was , blocking her path . And Libby , run down , unwound , empty-minded suddenly , turned and went out his door . He provoked me , she thought in the elevator . He provoked me . He and that son of a bitch Gabe . They lead me on . Ten minutes later , in Saks , she bought a sweater ; not the white cashmere , but a pale blue lamb's-wool cardigan that was on sale . It was the first time in years she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , walked a block south toward the I.C. train , and then turned and ran all the way back to Saks . Because the sweater had been on sale she had to plead with two floor managers and a buyer before they would give her back her money . At home later she tried several different ways of committing suicide , but the problem was that she did n't want to die . The problem was that she wanted to live . When she turned on the gas , she very soon turned it off , fearing an explosion . She went into the bedroom where she stretched out on the unmade bed and put a pillowcase over her head . But it was hot and uncomfortable , and every few minutes she kept releasing the opening around her neck to let air in . She remained on the bed for nearly an hour  --  what she began to want was for Paul to come home and catch her in the act . Sometimes she would pull the pillowcase off entirely , but as soon as she heard a footstep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the building , she would jerk it back over her , clamp tight the bottom , and wait . She wondered at various times ( there was nothing much else to do but think ) if she should write a note and take off her clothes and die  --  be caught dying  --  naked . Maybe he would come in , find her unclothed , and ravish her . And she would keep the pillowcase over her head all the while he devoured her body . But by four-thirty he was not home . She slipped the case , which was warm and damp from her breathing , back onto the pillow , and made the bed . She paced the apartment , looking  --  for what she did not really know . In the living room she sat down on the floor and began to sort through their books . When she came up with a gayly jacketed hook in her hands , she thought that perhaps unconsciously it was this hook she had been searching for . That day she believed strongly in the guiding light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rotten job , she had to . The book she held in her hand was not Faulkner , Fitzgerald , nor a book of verse ; it was thep353volume the rabbi in Ann Arbor had given her as a present after she had been dunked in the pool at the Y , and converted . The Wonder of Life it was called , and subtitled , " Suggestions for the JewishHomemaker . " Her eye moved eagerly over the blurb on the insideflap. " . . . creative , contemporary home life . . . traditions and ceremonies . . . how to build a Jewish record library . . . chapters on family fun , painting , music , literature , the conimunity , household finances . . . the place of the woman in a beautiful tradition . . . basic recipes . . . special holiday menus . . . how to plan a wedding , how to name a baby . . . " When everything had ended with Paul 's family , when they had slammed down the receiver at the news of Libby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed aside ; it had  --  remembering more clearly  --  been kicked aside . But never thrown out . Books were really all they owned , and wherever they moved , from Ann Arbor to Detroit to Iowa City to Reading to Chicago , from poverty to sicknessto humiliation , every single book was carried with them . Some were read , and others unread but coveted , and others just came along for the ride . That she had not even opened this one in all those years was understandable , since she was not religious or pious by nature . She was no worse a Jew , however , than she had been a Catholic  --  religion had always seemed to her " extra . " And perhaps thinking that was her mistake . Perhaps ( listen , she told herself , is this my unconscious at last making itself heard ? ) , perhaps the adoption agencies know what they are talking about ; maybe Marty Rosen 's question about the rabbi had not been improper after all . Not that one could force oneself to believe  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home . What she had always taken for granted about Jewish life was the warm family environment . And what an irony ! Look at Paul 's parents ; Paul himself . In the most Protestant household in America there could be no more coldness than had surrounded her first five years of marriage . But perhaps the fault was partly hers . Perhaps there was one final way out of all this mess that was not psychoanalysis , or money in the bank , or carnality , or self-pity , or madness : Religion . Not all that Christ and Mary hocuspocus ; not even a belief in God necessarily  --  though who could tell , . maybe God Himself would come in time . But first something basic and sustaining , something to make them truly ready for , deserving of , a baby ; something warm , sacred , worth while : traditions and ceremonies , holy days and holidays and customs . . . Thirty minutes later she was in the kitchen . The Wonder ofp354Life was spread open before her . Egg shells , peelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the book ; there was flour on the bridge of her nose , and on her forehead where she had touched her perspiring brow . She had been grating for ten minutes , but unfortunatelyshe had tiny wrists and was still on her first potato . Gratingand grating , and oh it was so idiotic . It was insane really , the end of a disastrous day , and still she grated . And because she was Libby and she had suffered ; because the more she suffered the further dignity and usefulness seemed to flee ; because her right hand was pulsating , aching , with the effort to bring a little religion into her house ; because finally she no longer believed in the restorative powers of anything or anyone , these latkes included , while she grated , she shed a few tears . Where the body found the reservoir to hold them , she could no longer imagine . But life is full of surprises , or thought of another way , is one long one . She heard a creak in the hallway . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and she turned , not the first time for that either . There stood Gabe Wallach . He has come for me , she thought . And now I 'd better go . Nothing else is left . Then Paul was there , coming down the hallway behind Gabe , dark and shambling . Was she dreaming ? Her two men . They have come for me , the two of them . All day they have followed me around and seen every stupid and selfish move . Gabe and Paul . Paul and Gabe . They are going to do something to me . . . But I am sweet and good . I deserve as much as anybody " I brought Gabe Wallach home , " Paul said , moving past his silent companion into the kitchen . She recognized his shoes , and the expression on his face . Too clearly . She was not dreaming . " What are you doing ? What 's on your forehead ? " " Flour , nothing  --  " " Libby , what are you up to ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to push everythingtogether on the table . She should n't have raised her voice . But what she was doing was nobody 's business but her own ; at least not with Gabe so icy and hostile in the doorway . Curtly she acknowledged his presence . " How do you do ? " He gave no acknowledgment back ; he waited . And for what ? Paul 's fired ! Why else would that son of a bitch be here ? He can smell bad news ! He hates us and we hate him and that 's it . Just last night . . . But the world had spun so in one day that she won/dered if she might not be mixed up about the night before . Had n't they all separated forever ? " He has  --  " Paul was saying , his hands way down in his coat pockets , ruining his posture , " he has some news for us . I want you to hear it . " " What is it ? What 's the matter ? " Paul removed a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " All right , all right , calm down , please . " In front of Gabe , why must he treat her like a child ! Who was on her side ? Who was left ? To Gabe , Paul said , " You had better come in . " He only moved forward one grudging step . Paul sat down and motioned for Libby to sit too . Wallach took a deep breath . " Look , I spoke to Paul this afternoonabout a baby . " Libby listened for more , but no more was immediately forthcoming . She had a sudden sense of having been violated  --  shame , shock , fear attacked her . The deepest chamber of her heart had been forced open , and a secret stolen  --  a secret she had not even known she 'd had . The two men whom she had turned against each other had come together and pooled their knowledge . They had made a decision for her about her life . She was going to have to hear a baby even if the two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh no ! Yes ! She had ovaries and tubes , did n't she , all the necessary equipment ? So what if it was a little risk  --  everybody had risks to take for everybody else . Had n't Paul taken plenty for her ? But that very patient doctor in Reading had carefully explained to them that childbirth might kill her . You see , Mr. Herz , she needs care , this frail girl of yours ; she 's hardly more than a child herself . How can she carry a foetus , bear a baby  --  she needs care and love , this one . Well , stop laughing  --  I do ! What 's wrong with that ? I ca n't have a baby ! I have bad kidneys ! You ca n't make me have a baby , either of you ! I might die ! When Gabe failed to go on , Paul said to her , " He knows of a baby . He thought we should be told about it . " " What ? " Libby said . " What baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private adoption . " " Why do n't you sit down ? " Paul said to him . " Would you , please ? " He suggested the chair next to his wife . " I want you to hear this , " he said then to Libby . " I want you to understand it all . " Gabe came as far as the chair , but chose not to sit down . Hisp356coat had a velvet collar . The dandy ! The fairy ! He probably could n't even do it himself , the cold-hearted rich bastard ! " There 's nothing to hear , " Gabe said . " I told you everything there is to tell . It 's up to you . You can tell it to her easier than I. " Paul said , " I 'd like Libby to hear it from you . Please . I do n't want her to get confused . " Why was he making her out to be such a handful ? I protect him  --  why ca n't he protect me ! " I do not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only listen . I want you to listen and decide . I asked him to come here , " Paul said , " so all the terms of the thing would be straight in your mind . " " What about you . . . ? " she began , but her husband quieted her , this time with only a glance , with only the pain in his eyes . " Somebody 's pregnant , " Gabe said , closing his eyes for a moment . " She does n't want the baby . You can adopt it  --  " He turned to Paul and threw up his arms . " Look , that 's what I told you . It 's still the same . You can do with this whatever you want . " Slowly , his elbows moving through several of the ingredients on the table , Paul turned to face his wife . " You see , " he explained , " it would n't be through an agency . I want you to understand this . It would be private . That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married ? " she asked . " The girl does n't want the baby , " Paul said . " She 's not married . " Libby looked up at Gabe . " Who is she ? " " A girl , " came the answer . " Well , I mean , who is she ? For you to say a girl  --  " " Libby , " Paul said , " she 's a student , all right ? " " It 's just a question , " she said . " How am I supposed to know ? " " She 's a student , " Paul repeated . " Where ? Here ? " Again she was asking Gabe . " I do n't know , " he mumbled . " Well , you 're the one who 's supposed to know her  --  " " I did n't say I knew her , " Gabe cut in . " At the Art Institute , " Paul said , hitting the table . " Does that answer the question , Libby ? " She knew then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even angrier , the discovery soothed and comforted ; it seemed to give her an advantage . " I do n't know , " she said . " Who 's the father ? What is he ? Who is he ? Why does n't he marry her ? Is it her boy friend ? "  | " I do n't know anything about the father , " Gabe answered flatly . He looked over to Paul . " I gave you the girl 's name . You can get in touch with her and work it out from there , if you want to . Does n't that make sense ? " Paul did n't answer . " All right , Lib ? " he asked . " What do you think ? How does it seem to you ? " " We do n't know anything about the father , for one thing . " She had made it sound as though Gabe was responsible . " We do n't even begin to know anything  --  " " And I said I do n't know anything about the father either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his steely face . " You do n't have to be rude ! " He focused on her a mean , bored expression , while Paul said , " Let 's just conduct this business  --  " " Well , I am , " said Libby . " You ca n't expect me to jump in . We do n't even know anything about the father . " " He 's probably a student , " Paul said . " Oh sure , he 's probably a faculty member , " Gabe said , as though to himself . Oh the cruel bastard ! He had no respect for what she had been through . " Well , " she said to him , " it 's just a matter of establishing something , if you do n't mind . " " Through an agency , " Gabe said , " you would n't know any more . " " As a matter of fact we certainly would . They try to match you up , the parents and the infant  --  coloring , eyes , general  --  " But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , " he was saying to Paul , " you do with this whatever you want . May I go now ? " Paul did n't even look at him ; apparently he could n't . He shrugged , and it seemed as though he were straw , not flesh , under his coat . " You 'll have to do whatever you think best , " he said . " Fine , " Gabe said ; he started out of the kitchen . " Well , we have a right to know , " Libby shouted after him . " It 's our lives . You do n't have to be so huffy about it . " He turned and leaned in the doorway , one hand on either wall . " Can I go ? " " Well "  --  she was swallowed up by panic  --  " we do n't even know anything about her  --  " " Paul knows . "  | " Oh  --  yes ? " And now she did not want to hear another word . The mother was a call girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " May I leave now ? " Gabe asked . " Oh go ! " Libby shot back . " If you 're so impatient , go , get out of here  --  we do n't want to keep you . " She found that her husband was openly staring at her . His eyes , his kind eyes . . . Oh yes , she had been found out . " Libby , " Gabe said , " why do n't you use your head  --  " " Do n't start insulting us , " she demanded , and now she quickly turned her head and met Paul 's eyes . Why did n't he protect her ? Oh cruel men  --  cruel heartless self-absorbed bastards ! " Libby , " Gabe said , softening , " I got this information and I thought you might be interested in it . And  --  and that 's it , that 's all there is to it . " " Well , is n't that nice . We 've just been going through perfect hell trying to adopt a baby , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine we might be interested . " " Oh screw it , " he said , and started down the hall . Libby rose out of her chair , crying after him , " But we do n't know anything ! " " We know , we know , " Paul reached across with his hand . " But what do we do ? " she cried . She looked at Paul . Would he know what to do ? Poor Paul ? Poor trampled-on Paul ? " Gabe , what do we do ? " She heard him call , " You get in touch with her . You better see her . . . " She ran to the hallway ; at the end of the apartment she saw just the paleness of his face and his hand on the knob . " No  --  " she said , " I wo n't  --  I ca n't  --  " The hand on the knob turned ; his feet , thank God , stayed put . " Then Paul sees her , " he said . " When you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take it from there . Maybe it would he best to get a lawyer in right at the beginning . Look , Libby , he knows all this  --  " She turned back to her husband . " A lawyer , " she moaned . Paul was moving toward her with his arms extended ; she could no longer read the expression on his face . " It 's all right  --  we 'll talk about it - " We do n't know any lawyers . Lawyers cost a fortune  --  " " I 'll take care of it , " Paul said . He took hold of her arms.  | " We 'll take care of it . We still have the agency . They 'll send somebodysoon . Relax , honey , we can wait . If you prefer , if it will make you feel safer , then we 'll wait and work through the agency . I thought you did n't want to wait , that 's all . " " Oh no , " she said , " oh no no no , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not today . " Oh it 's ugly and sordid , and everything'salways the same . " " Do n't cry . " " I 'm not crying ! Do you see me crying ? I 'm just making a statement . Everything 's ugly and sordid ! Ca n't I say that ? " " Sure . " His hands dropped from her arms . " Oh Paul  --  " " I 'm going . " It was Gabe 's voice , faint , almost gone . " I 'll be going now . " " Go ! Just go ! " she cried . " That 's it  --  close the door and go ! " But she came charging down upon him . " You just go , damn it . And thank you . Oh yes , do n't think we do n't appreciate everything either . We appreciate every tiny single thing you 've ever done , Gabe . Oh we kiss your high and mighty ass , Gabe , do n't you forget that . Thank you , thank you for this helpful hint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , shaking her fist , " so kind he probably went out and impregnated a little eighteen-year-old student , especially for us  --  " " Why do n't you watch what you 're saying , Libby . " " Why ? Ca n't you stand a little horror in your life ? I can . Paul can . " And she thought : I ca n't . Paul ca n't . Too much already . Now more . Paul will meet the mother , take her to doctors , pay her bills , listen to her sad story , watch her weep . He will remember her face and carry it with him through life . She will be the mother  --  I ' 11 be the stepmother . He 'll see her face , her eyes , her hair , her tears  --  then who will I have ! "  --  do n't want your appreciation , " Gabe was saying , " so do n't kid yourself about that  --  " " Oh but we appreciate so much , " she said . " Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How can any of us help ourselves ? All the world loves Gabe , but who does Gabe love ? We 're all waiting to hear  --  who ? Oh you 're something , Gabriel , you really are  --  " His hands were fists ; that big chin of his was leaning out at her . " What is it you want , Libby ? What is it you 're after now ? "  | " Oh , I do n't want anything from you ! " She felt Paul 's hands come down on her shoulders . " Cut it out , Libby , control yourself  --  " Paul was saying . But she was flailing her arms , to be free . " Nothing . You do what you want . People do n't tell you what to do  --  " " People tell me plenty , " Gabe said . " Too God damn much ! " " Oh do they ? " " Yes ! " " Then let me tell you  --  " and suddenly her voice had dropped , and it was harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  do n't make Pauldo it ! Do n't make Paul see her ! Gabe , please , the last thing  --  " " 1 should never have come here ; Libby  --  " " It 'll kill us . It 's our baby , not hers . Ours ! Please ! " " Libby " . . . " Libby  --  " Both men were calling her name , and in the dim hallway they swooped down around her and lifted her off the floor , where , on her hands and knees , she was begging.  |p361Although  Theresa Haug 's pale blue uniform  --  the same washedoutcolor as her eyes  --  swam around her hunched shoulders and permitted a good two inches of air to circulate about her frail upper arm , it had nevertheless already begun to hug her belly . She had been seduced in November ; perhaps October  --  this was yet to be established . I watched her clear a table and then try to take an order from one booth while she dealt with a complaint about an underdone steak from another across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but given my mood and the turnings of my mind , it was almost preferable to having to watch Mark Reganhart inhale his French fried potatoes , the last of which lay on his plate , a squad of broken-backed , tortured soldiers oozing ketchup at every fork wound . All of Markie 's infantile habits , toward which I had felt kind or neutral at other times , had begun to exasperate me in the last few days . I was about to snap at him when I remembered , I am not his father , he is not my son , and turned away . Again I looked at Theresa Haug , who stood a few booths from where we sat . To customers , she was mute and obliging , and efficient to the point of hysteria ( or perhaps it was hysteria to the point of efficiency , it looked the same to me ) . In any encounter with the hostess , Mrs. Crowther  --  an egregious woman who was always sliding people into their seats with a melodic , " There you are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salute . Not that Mrs. Crowther , or anybody else , paid Theresa very much attention ; there wasn'tp362very much to attend to . All of her , form and features , seemed to have been designed and constructed by a committee of Baptist ministers ' wives . Her stockings hung from her underdeveloped calves in a particularly heartbreaking way , her skin held no mysteries , and her mouth was just a faint-hearted dash across the blankness of her expression . Yet someone had taken the trouble to undress her and lay her down and climb on top . A seed had been dropped , and it was about its fruition that I had come to see her . For Martha ( not myself ) I had spoken to Paul Herz ; for Paul I had spoken to Libby ; for Libby I would speak to Theresa Haug . What other way could it have been ? " Cut your potatoes , " Cynthia told her brother . " Stop stuffing yourself . Stop janiming them in whole , Markie . Uh-oh for you . Here comes Mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and mistress , set down two glasses of chocolate milk and a cup of coffee . " How is everyone ? " she asked . " Markie 's not using any manners , " Cynthia said . " I do n't think he should he allowed to sleep at Stephanie 's . " " I want to ! " Mark howled . " Cynthia , " Martha said , " do n't tease him . Markie , stop whin-ing . " " You were the one who said if he was n't going to use manners  --  " began Cynthia . Weary , quite weary of this little family group and their aggravationsand struggles ( my family ? mine ? ) , I asked Martha , " When does she get off ? " " Seven  --  " " Mother  --  " " I 'm talking to Gabe . " I turned on Cynthia . " She 's talking to me , Cynthia  --  how about it ? " " When 's Stephanie 's grandma coming ? " asked Markie . " Soon , honey . " To show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clicked her tongue at the violence her brother was practicing with his fork . And a feeling came over me , a rootless kind of feeling , that control over my affairs was no longer in my own hands . Something like resignation  --  most likely disgust , and perhapsfear too  --  must have shown on my face . " You do n't have to wait for Stephanie 's grandmother , " Marthap363said to me . " If it bothers you so . . . The kids can wait by them-selves . " " I 'm not waiting for Stephanie 's grandmother . I 'm waiting for your friend . " " She 'll be through at seven . " " It 's after seven . " " Then she 'll be through soon . Look , Gabe  --  " A waitress came hurtling by our booth then , her tray tipping toward a disaster which might or might not overtake her before she reached the kitchen . " There she is , " I said . Martha reached out to touch Theresa 's arm . " It 's seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this here  --  maybe some other  --  too rare he says , " and with a droopy-eyed look she showed Martha a steak on her tray . " I 'll take your station , " Martha said . " But Mrs. Crowther  --  " " Theresa , get dressed . I 'll take your station . He 's waiting . " " Yes  --  " She ran off down the aisle , leaving me exhausted . Marthakissed each child on the top of the head and went off toward the kitchen with Theresa 's steak . " Miss . . . " someone called after her , but she was her own woman , guardian of her rights and dignity , and she just kept going . With a newsiness altogether uncharacteristic of her , Cynthia said , " We 're not sleeping at home tonight . " " That should be fun , " I said . " I ) o you like to sleep at other people 's houses ? " " Sometimes . " " Do you ? " Markie asked me . I took a napkin from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ketchup off his mouth . " You try to concentrate on eating , " I said . Cynthia pointed to where I had wiped her brother 's mouth . " I think my mother wants him to learn to do that himself . " " I suppose she does . " " He should be able to teach himself to grow up a little , " she said . " He should , " I agreed , " but he does n't , and the rest of us have to look at it . " " I think my mother would prefer if you let him do that himself , " she said beautifully.  | " I did n't steal his mouth from him , Cynthia  --  I only wiped it . " Markie 's dark eyes now turned up to me , his chin grazing theremains on the plate . " Are you going to marry our Mommy ? " Now I smiled . " He certainly is full of questions . " " He 's only a child , " Cynthia said , which in a variety of ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child those are pretty adult questions . " Cynthia was nonplused ; finally she admitted , " Well . . . he talks to me . " My daughter . My stepdaughter . My stepson . Sitting there I continued to be visited with what ifs , and supposes . Theresa Haug appeared in a big black-and-white checkerboard coat with saucer-sized buttons that shone . She stood beside the booth , speechless . Cynthia shrugged her shoulders , as though to indicate to me -- and to the lady herself  --  that our visitor might be coo-coo . " It 's okay , " I said , getting up from my seat , " she 's a friend of your mother 's . " " I do n't care , " answered Cynthia in a tinkly voice . Markic had picked up the ketchup bottle , turned it on its side , and was allowing its contents to run out onto his plate . He asked , " Is that his wife ? " but I do n't think Theresa Haug heard . " Ready , Miss Haug ? " I asked , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steer her toward the door . " Bye , Gabe , " I heard Markie call . I did n't turn back ; I was trying to focus all my attention on my charge and on her hardship . Nevertheless I could not really displacemy own problem with hers . Martha 's teary ultimatum of two short nights before still burned in my mind . As for Martha herself , it was clear that she too had not forgotten those words she had addressed to me from her bed . Surely saving Theresa Haug was not , in anything other than a metaphoric way , saving herself . Outside the Hawaiian House , Theresa stopped . Like a poor dumb beast . I said , " I 'm parked a little way off . By Dorchester . . . " I tugged at her arm , then guided her along like one blind . She kept her gaze on her coat buttons . " It 's a beautiful night for a change , " I said . There was indeed a sky overhead that was purple and practically glowing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added . " That should be a help . . . " At last we made it to the car ; I unlocked the door and helped her in . The overhead light spread like some watery dime-store paint over her plain , dull face . I closed the door for her and then walkedp365around to the other side , in a kind of stupor too , for I was wondering if it made life more sensible , or less , to think that it was toward the alleviation of this girl 's suffering that all the rest of us had been struggling  --  Paul , Libby , Martha , myself  --  these many months and years . I took Theresa Haug to a restaurant on the lake shore where , to offset the sugary Muzak piped into the dining room , the walls were hung with lurid paintings of the Chicago fire . The combination of music and art impressed me as ghoulish and antisocial , but the place was quiet and close by , and it had soft lighting and a view of the lake . Theresa could have dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candlelight . I had been hoping that the shadowy atmosphere might loosen her up without unhinging her , but once there she still refused to look my way . At the check room I lived through a desperate moment trying to help her out of her coat . Evidently she thought I had lost my mind and was trying to wrestle her down onto the carpet , for she uttered a forlorn hopeless little cry ( her first sound ) and nearly fell backwards onto me , waving her arms . " Please , please . . . your coat , " I pleaded , and then she either caught on or gave herself up to still another assault , and I got what I was after , plus her limp body . Through this confusion , the hat-check girl stood at my side tapping her lacquered nails on the metal checking tokens . She was a crooked-mouthed bitch in a black crepe dress , sporting the packed-in , boxcar variety of voluptuousness ; I gave her a dirty look , and then the gaudy coat , and taking Theresa by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Within the gentle throbbing light , underexercised , overfed merchants were enjoying dinner with their families . The specialty of the house was spareribs , and around the dim room I could see men , women , and children eating daintily with their hands , manipulating their food like Muzak 's violinists their instruments . While Theresa occupied herself with a minute scrutiny of her shoes and mine , I began to believe I had made a small error of tact and taste , and out of a small and petty fearfulness . We should have gone to a drive-in hamburger joint , I thought , and sat in the car , and said what had to be said , and thereby recognized the real and unpretty dimensions of our meeting . There was an unrelentinglysedate good-natured carniverousness in the air here and it somehow led me to reflect upon the cautionary nature of allp366prosperous people everywhere , myself included . I had convinced myself I would be doing the girl a service by bringing her to a muted middle-class rendezvous , carpeted and melodic , when actually the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old person one usually sets out to spare , no matter how complex the strategy . Theresa carried a long plastic purse with her , about the size and shape of a loaf of bread ; its insides were visible to the naked eye . Walking into the dining room , I felt it rhythmically whacking my side , and though I decided to show nothing , at one point the girl herself nearly looked up at me to apologize . But she was n't quite able to pull it off ; she merely hugged the purse to her and sank back into her pool of shame . Finally  --  nothing in life being endless  --  our crossing was over and we sat at a small corner table . " Miss Haug . . . " I said . She was searching through her purse and , oblivious to the fact that my mouth was open , continued to search until she came up with an orange Lifesaver which she slipped secretively between her lips . I decided I had to allow her still more time to calm down , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I resented and suspected her manner ( at the same time I responded to it ) , for all I had begun to hate both Herzes for the crazed and wild sparing of one another that they engaged in at the expense of others  --  had perhaps been prophetic in pleading that Paul be spared the job of interviewing the pregnant young woman . Not that I was myself in possession of a calm reasonableness , or even a plan of action ; simply , my disappointment in seeing what Theresa was , was not the disappointment of a prospective father . Surely it is possible that Paul Herz might have wept or become angry or gotten up and walked out . I did not see any of these choices open to me . I would let her finish her Lifesaver , order a little dinner , and then begin to extract from her the information and promises necessary , and give her whatever advice she would be needing . In twenty-four hours I had become a kind of authority on adoption . Leaving the Herzes ' apartment I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campus , where I had made my way to the law library and settled down angrily with the appropriate texts . That morning I had learned more through a telephone call Martha had made to her lawyer friend , Sid Jaffe . Jaffe had been exceedingly thorough and informative , and after she hung up , Martha told me he had even said that he would try to help her two young friendsp367with the papers and legal work when the time came . " Free , " she added . It had been generous of Jaffe , but facile I thought , and though I could not actually resent the offer , given what it would mean to Paul and Libby , I would have liked to make it clear to Martha what I believed to be her old boy friend 's motive . Instead I found myself displaying a sizable amount of approval ( is n't that wonderful , is n't that swell ) while Martha made several statements almost punishable in the grossness of their nostalgia  --  statements about Sid 's sweetness and reliability . Though the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been unfairly tested and unfairly judged . That Jaffe was sweet and reliable was perfectly all right with me , but after all , he had not been through with the Herzes what I had been . Anyway , if Jaffe was so sweet and reliable , why had n't she taken her two kids and married him ? Of course I said nothing of the sort  --  though the night before , it happened that I had said something of the sort . It should be made clear that it had been Martha and not I who had suggested that the same Libby Herz who had given us all such a monstrous evening , should become the mother of Theresa Haug 's bastard child . Some time around four in the morning  --  this was in bed , after the Herzes ' departure  --  Martha had no scruple about awakening me to tell me her idea . I sat up a moment , and then in a groggy fury got out of bed and came down upon the floor . I stormed around that room , round and round it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised my voice , feeling in me all the ferocity of someone in a dream getting his sweet revenge . The hell with them ! Fuck them  --  the two of them ! I 've had enough ! Too damn much ! Let them take care of themselves ! Then I got back into bed . Through it all Martha watched me in what must have seemed a moment of pure insanity . Or maybe not ; maybe it looked very sane indeed , and practical . For it occurred to me  --  and why not to her ?  --  that it was not only my involvement with the Herzes that had caused me to erupt as I had . Afterwards there was silence in the bedroom , darkness and winter , and the knowledge that beside me Martha was thinking her thoughts . And I was thinking mine : My life , what is it ? My life , where has it gone ? One moment I knew myself to be justified and the next vindictive ; one moment sensible and the next ignorant and cruel . The battle raged all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flying a big red flag reading i AM , kept rushing forward  --  my patriot ! my defender ! my own self ! It cried out that I had every right to be cruel , every rightp368to be through with the Herzes . With everybody . It raised a question that is by no means new to the species : How much , from me ? At long last morning came . Light . In the day the self does noti dare fly the banners it gets away with at night . In the day there are Martha 's eyes ; there is Mark , visible ; there is Cynthia , a brownhairedchild three feet nine inches tall . There was a glimpse of Paul Herz 's head as he closed the door to his Humanities class . When he has just had a haircut , the back of a man 's head is where he looks most vulnerable . I am . He is . We are . What will be ? It was not willingly that I went sliding back into what I wanted to slide out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chancing a small glance  --  through her small eyes  --  over at me . " Miss Haug , " I said once again , and without even a fight she surrendered to her gracelessness and immediately twisted one of the buttons off her blouse . The next problem seemed so large as to be facing all the diners in the room : what to do with the button ? I thought , She wants me to call her Mrs. Haug  --  is that it ? and the girl sat there dangling the button by its broken thread , spellbound by the sheer , unrelenting sweep of her misfortune . Finally I found myself extending my hand . She dropped the button into my palm and I deposited it into my coat pocket . Her hands dove out of sight , and a strange rattling arose . I realized after a moment that its source was her skirt , a gold , luminous , bespangled garment that apparently dispatched noises upon making contact with a foreign object . Under the skirt a half-dozen crinolines were supposed to add joie de vivre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions . I began feelingless and less hopeful about the chance of our exchanging two complete sentences ; then my mind took a giddy turn and I could hear someone disrobing Theresa Haug : freeing her from her orchestralskirt , flicking open her remaining buttons , unsnapping all that seemed to hold in a piece her upper half . There was some chillingfragility about her which suggested that the elaborate network of straps and frills beneath her sheer blouse was there for unfortunate orthopedic reasons . I looked at her only with sympathy and noticed the silver cross that met the rise of her slip ; the metal touching flesh made me conscious of the actuality under the clothes . It was incredible ; under those layers of shiny cloth lived a woman with sexualp369parts . It was only a short step to wondering about the man who had seduced her . Seduction ? What could the fellow have wanted ? Found ? The waitress was now beside us . " How about something to cat ? " I asked . She barely opened her mouth , but nevertheless managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . " Not even a sandwich ? I would n't be hurt if you settled for a sandwich . " I smiled . She did n't . The waitress , a wall-eyed blonde in no great rapport with the world 's sorrows , coughed . " Coffee ? " I asked . " Uh-uh . " " I 'm going to have coffee and a piece of apple pie . How does that sound to you ? " I waited only a second more , then spoke directly into the waitress 's boredom . " Would you bring us coffee and pie ? " " Two or one ? " " Two . " Theresa signaled neither pleasure nor its opposite ; if you orderedher pie , she 'd eat pie . And so it turned out . When the waitress lowered our dishes onto the tablecloth , whose soft white glow we had both been wordlesslyfacing for three minutes , Theresa picked up her fork , dislodgeda tiny square of crust , halved it , halved the half , then pressed the back of the fork into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prongs . She carried them to her lips and finally ate in a little birdy way that I gradually realized was her conception of manners . Who had seduced her , I wondered , catching sight of her tongue ? Who had wanted to ? It was an endless time before she had swallowed the few flakes of crust . " Would you like a glass of water ? " I asked . " She 's forgotten our water . . . Excuse me , but would you like an Alka-Seltzer ? " " Uh-uh . " " You 're all right ? " She closed her eyes , then batted the lashes . " They . . . have . . nice . . . pie , " she finally articulated . " Home baked . " " Yes , it 's awfully good , is n't it ? Do they have home-baked pie in the Hawaiian House ? " She proceeded to deliver a series of shrugs and head-bobs to indicate yes , no , and finally that she was n't sure . She returned to her plate , separating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost invisible.  | " You do n't have to eat it if you do n't want to , " I said . " . . . It 's nice and tasty . " " But do n't force yourself , " I said , unnerved . " If you 've already had dinner . . . " " Is there a powder room for ladies ? " " I think so . Do n't you feel well ? Would you like some help ? " " I want to comb my hair . " She was standing , and I wondered if she were going to pass out . In a rush , my napkin sliding to the floor , I rose and took a step toward her ; the girl 's face registered its first emotion : panic . " What is it ? " I asked . Her pale face had , incredibly , paled . " Where you goin ' ? " she demanded . " Nowhere . " " I thought you were goin ' . " The people at the table beside ours looked up over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , " I said softly . " 1lh-huh . I was goin ' to wash up . " " I was just standing , " I said , feeling my own color change . " Yes ? " " Why do n't you just go ahead ? " She walked off , holding her purse in one hand and her table napkin in the other . I sat down  --  sank down in my chair . Muzak swathed me in cottonbatting and the gentle flickerings of the candles erased the flaws in the faces of the other diners . Everyone looked younger than he was , and my memory went reeling back to those first few evenings ( or were they Saturday afternoons ? ) I had ever taken out a girl , back to all those Chinese restaurants on the upper West Side , where with a squared-off handkerchief in my breast pocket and a scented lacquer of my mother 's holding fast my recalcitrant hair , I waited for my sixteen-year-old companions to return from the powder room so that we could get on with the egg roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my first dinner partners as a sort of coquetry on a very primal level  --  the mysteries of the body 's lower half for the anxious , throbbing adolescent boy to ponder  --  and it occurred to nie it might be something like that for Theresa Haug as well . So far our evening had certainly been like some wearisome blind date : the boy trying bravely to live up to parental expectations of gallantry ; the girl staking her all on an imbecilic shyness , which was at bottom only a misguided and sullen sort of flirtation . All that abysmalp371helplessness . . . all the fastening of my mind upon the word seduction . I reached into my pocket for a handkerchief and came up insteadwith the button off Theresa 's blouse . When she returned to the table I did not stand and so we managed to get by without incident . I noticed reddish blotches directly beneath her eyes , and then on her arms too . " Are you sure you 're all right ? " I asked . " Better , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling guilty now for having shoved the pie upon her  --  " you do n't happen to be allergic to apple ' ! " Of all things , she became coy ; her hands began to flutter all over . I realized now that Theresa Haug had an age . She was no more than nineteen . " What is it , Theresa ? " Her mouth flickered at either end ; I was present at the birth of a smile . " Yes ? " I said . " Oh  --  I just try to bring up some color  --  in my face ? " She ended on a high , questioning note . " In the winter I go so white . . . " " Are you from the South ? " " Uh-huh . " The emphasis I took for regional pride . " You ai n't , " she said . " I 'm from New York . " " Mister ? " " Yes  --  " " Are you the doctor ? Are n't you goin ' to examine me  --  wlwre ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor . I should have made it clear . " " I thought you was the doctor . " " Well , no . I 'm a friend of the people  --  " " I 'm supposed to see the doctor , " she moaned . " You will , " I said . " Please do n't worry . That 's all going to be taken care of . I 'm a friend of the people who are interested in adopting your baby . The baby . Martha said you were interested in giving up the child for adoption . " " Martha Lee said you was the doctor  --  " " No , I do n't think she did . There must have been a little confusion . She must have said that I 'd tell you about a doctor . " Her mouth became so thin a line that I could hardly see it . " Who are you ? " " I 'm a friend , " I repeated , " of the people who are interested in the adoption . Look , you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a go-between , you see . I 'll answer any questions you have , and so forth . Is that okay ? Really now , you do n't have to worry about a thing . " " I 'm not worried , " she said , pathetically . " That 's fine . " " I thought you was the doctor . See , I just have to get to a doctor . " " Of course . . . " " ' Cause I 'm from Shelby County  --  Kentucky ? " she said . " And I know , you see , all this snowin ' and the bad weather and all  --  ? " " Yes ? " " I know it 's just "  --  she flushed  --  " affected my monthlies . A few warm days and I 'll be myself again . " " Miss Haug , have n't you been to a doctor yet ? Did n't a doctor tell you you were pregnant ? " " Ile were n't no specialist . Just a plain old doctor . " " Well , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to see an obstetrician as soon as you like . " She seemed angry . " What people ? " " The people who want to adopt your baby . " " What am I supposed to do about that ? " I made believe I had n't heard . " They 're very decent people , I assure you . They 're very anxious to give this baby a home . I 'm sure they 'll give it a good home , and all that it needs . " I could see that everything I had been saying was entirely besidethe point as far as she was concerned . Nevertheless I went on . " The father  --  " Here she came alive . " Oh he do n't care ! " " He does , " I said . " Look , he ai n't got nothin ' to do with it ! " It was her first display of passion and I realized that we were talking about two different people . " Is this person in Chicago ? " I asked . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not interested in talking about this person . " " You do n't think he 's interested in the child then ? " " I do n't know  --  " she said , " I hardly know him . " I tried to accept that , blank-faced . " You see , " she said , leaning forward so as to whisper , " I keep , well , throwin ' up  --  and well , now I 'm really wonderin ' if it could n't be some kind of appendix condition . In the stomach ? "  | " I do n't think so . I do n't think it would be appendix . " " You 're no doctor , " she said . " That 's right . But neither are you . " " That do n't mean nothin ' . I had an aunt  --  my aunt ? and she lived in our house , and she had an appendix , real bad ? And all she was doin ' was throwin ' up left and right . " " That may be . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Aunt had two syllables . " Seventy . " " And how old are you ? " " Twenty , next month . " " Well , " I said , " there are a lot of physical conditions that can make a person nauseous . Appendicitis is certainly one , so is food poisoning  --  " " I do n't think I got that , " she said , shaking her head . " Pregnant women often become nauseous too , you know . " After a moment , in a small voice , she asked , " You think I 'm goin ' to have a baby ? " " I 'm no doctor , Theresa , but I think so . " " Oh boy . . . " She rested her forehead in her hands . " But you knew that , did n't you ? " She blurted out , " Well , what about me ? What about when I quit work ? What happens to me ? " " What do you mean , what happens ? " " I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mister  --  money . " " Theresa , calm down . You have to understand that I 'm only an acquaintance of the family . So I ca n't tell you much about money . They 'll . . . look , I 'm going to give you the name of a lawyer , Mr. Jaffe  --  " " I ca n't pay no lawyer . Oh boy , " she cried . " I need a doctor . Now Martha Lee told me  --  " " You 've got to calm yourself . You do n't have to pay anybody anything . " " I paid somebody a hundred dollars already . And I do n't know where he is at all . " " Who ? " " He was goin ' to get me a doctor . . " You ca n't find him now ? " She shook her head . " That 's too bad , " I said . She widened her eyes . " That 's awful . " " Look now , you do n't have to worry about anything like that.  |p374You  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers so that it 's all legal . You simply have to grant permission to the couple so that they can adopt your baby . The baby . The lawyer will speak to you about the arrangements . His name is Sidney Jaffe . He 's right here in Chicago , so there 's no trouble or expense  --  " " He 's a Jew ? " she asked , a twang in the last word . " I think he is . " " Uh-oh . " " What 's the matter ? " She shrugged . " I do n't know . It just makes me sort a nervous . " " Well , do n't be . " " Mister ? " " My name is Wallach . Gabriel Wallach . " " I want to go to a Catholic hospital , mister . With the sisters . I ai n't goin ' by no Jewish hospital , you better tell that to that lawyer . " " I will . " " I want to go by the sisters , you understand now ? There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car , and he was just alayin ' there in the road ? And then they take him in the ambulance to the Jewish hospital  --  and they set all his bones and everything , and they gave him ether and all stuff like that , so he was knocked out good , and then counta he was a boy , they made a Jew out of him . " " I do n't understand . " " You know , " she said , " what they do to ' em . " " Are you sure about that ? " " Oh mister . . . " she cried , and she put her head right down on the table and let the giggles sweep in and conquer her . It took awhile , but finally she sat up and told me , " That 's what they say anyway . He was a nigger , so must be . You ever been to Shelby County ? " " No . " " Well , that 's my home . " " Theresa , are you a Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I want , " she said sharply . " This here is a free country . " " I was only curious . I did n't think there were many Catholics in Kentucky . " " Well , you 're wrong ! " she shot back . " You must be thinkin ' of Republicans . " I said I supposed I was . " At least you 're a Catholic , somebody takes care of you , I'llp375tell you . I want to go by the sisters . Now you got to tell that lawyer  --  I do n't want no Jewish hospital ! " " I 'll tell him . I do n't think there 'll be any difficulty . Now Theresa "  --  I took a breath  --  " could I ask you when  --  " Suddenly She was blowing out air , as though she 'd just finished a race . " I do n't think I feel too good . I think maybe , maybe I ought to go right on home . " " Well , if you 're not well , sure  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Of course . " " Do you know where the train is ? " " You do n't have to take the train . I 'll  --  " " I think maybe  --  " But then she was n't thinking anything ; she ran off to the lady 's room. *As I was driving her to Gary , Theresa said to me , " I think I need some gum . " " I 'm sorry , I do n't have any . " " Ca n't we stop ? " " I suppose so . " " See that diner up there ? Could we stop there ? " I pulled off the road and onto the gravel parking area around the diner . I wondered if the girl was going to he sick again and quickly got out of the car and came around to open her door . Inside I saw Theresa running a comb through her orange hair and twisting the rear-view mirror to get a look at herself . There was a glow in the sky , a dusty red light thrown up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neon sign gave off a steady buzzing . All it said was EAT . I held the door of the diner open for her and the only verb to describe her movement then is sashay . She sashayed on through . Inside , the counterman said , " Look who 's here , " but did not unfold his hairy arms . He was leaning against the sandwich counter , a fellow with a brow like a bumper . " If it ai n't Miss Dixie Belle , " he said . " How are you , Fluke ? " Her tone astonished me ; she 'd become patronizing . " We heard you was dead , " he answered . " Well I ain't. "  | " No kiddin ' , " Fluke said . " No  --  no kiddin ' ! " She tossed her head , then let it whirl all the way around so that she was looking over at me , where I hung back by the door . I smiled . Theresa smiled back . It was like seeing a balloondeflated  --  and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , did not seem to expect anything else from Theresa but this display of verve and wit . He did not appear to be too crazy about her , but exhibited the deference , at any rate , that one gives to people who are always on their toes . With a less benign look in his undersized eyes , he looked at me . It was obvious that he took a particular dislike to my clothes . " What can we do for you , Tessie ? " " I 'd like some Blackjack , " she said , " if you do n't mind . " " Oh I do n't mind . " " Do n't you ? " " You 're sump'n , Dixie , " Fluke said , and with a groan  --  the groan of a man who totes around more thick dull tissue than the rest of us  --  Fluke raised himself off with the gum . Theresa took the pack and turned to me . " Oh yes , " I said , coming forward . I could not find any change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my billfold . He did n't like the billfold any more than the coat and hat . He put my change on the counter , mostly nickels . " Here , " Theresa said to me , and handed me a stick of gum . " Thanks , " I said . " It 's your nickel , " she said , significantly . Then to Fluke , " You do n't look like you 're workin ' too hard . " " There 's a recession startin ' . Do n't you read the papers ? " " I read plenty of papers , " she retorted . " Oh yeah ? " said Fluke , and looked my way again as though I had introduced her to the pernicious habit . " I read the Tribune , " Theresa said . " I read the Sun-Times , and I read the Chicago Maroon , which you probably ai n't even heard of down here . " The last named was the University student newspaper . " You 're a big reader , " Fluke said . We stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theresa unpeeled her stick of gum , and we all paid undue attention to the operation . Fluke said , " Where you workin ' ? "  |p377It  was the question she 'd been waiting for . " No diner , I 'll tell you that . " " Yeah ? " said Fluke , shutting his eyes . " Where you workin " ? You workin ' even ? " " In Chicago , " said Theresa . " The Hawaiian House . " " Big deal , " Fluke said . " At least the customers wash their hands , " Theresa informed him , " after they come out of the john . " She must have had him there , for it took him a while to regroup his troops . " You 're workin ' up by that school , " he said , " you better watch out or the Comm-uh-nists 'll get you . " " So what am I supposed to do about that ? " She tossed her shoulders and her coat fell open . Fluke whistled . " Still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . " " It 's gon na cost some guy a fortune just keepin ' you in under-wear . " " That 's not funny  --  that 's plain dirt . " She turned away , and I put my hat back on . " At least , at least "  --  Fluke could n't keep a straight face for this one  --  " at least I did n't say panties , ' did I ? " " That 's not funny any more , Fluke , " she said . " You do n't know where to stop , that 's your trouble . " She came over and took my arni . " Yeah ? " Fluke said . " I ought a wash my mouth out with Mr. Clean . " I opened the door  --  Theresa was waiting for me to . Pluke called , " Watch out for those Reds , Dixie , before they kidnap you back to Russia . " She turned just her head , and that with disdain . " It so happens that people up there ai n't people down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got it , " said Fluke mysteriously . " Take it easy , Tessie . Take it easy , sport . " Sport was me ; Theresa had already swept out when I looked back to discover that Fluke had become a well-wisher ; he raised a hand , and made a circle with his thumb and index-finger . Then he winked . As I stepped out under the EAT sign , Theresa barged back across my path . She shouted in through the open doorway , " You can tell Dewey he can go straight to hell ! "  |p378When  we were back in the car , driving south , Theresa offered me a nickel . " That 's all right , " I said , and she put the nickel away . She asked , " Can we turn the radio on ? " " Yes . " " Are you mad ? " she asked . " No . " " He 's just got a dirty mind . Fluke ai n't even his real name . He 's just a Polock . " " I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like better ? " She mentioned the names of two Chicago disc jockeys . " Whichever you want , " I said . She tuned her station in with care and patience , fiddling with the tone as well as the volume . Then , with the music pounding , she said , " See  --  I used to work there . " " I did n't know that . " " It 's not very nice down there , " she told me . We drove on toward the outskirts of Gary where Theresa lived . As we approached , the red in the sky grew more intense , and we could see two pilot flames burning stiff above their towers . Theresa was singing along with the record . " Earth angel , earth angel , Will you be mi-ine ? Earth angel , earth angel , Will you be mi-ine ? " You better give me directions from here on , " I said , interrupting . " Down by the next light you turn right . " She went back to her singing . The disc jockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our cars , or sitting in our living rooms , or just III ( Ting around the house missing that special someone , where to buy a used car . Then he put on a new record , the words of which were ciluallv familiar to my companion . I take it you feel better , " I said . Her head was back on the seat . " I appreciate all you 're doin ' , Mr. Wallace . Are you Martha Lee 's steady ? " To save wear and tear , I said , " No , just a friend . "  | " Look  --  " she said , " you  --  you 're not the fella who 's goin ' to adopt my baby ? " " I 'm not . If I was I would have told you . " She considered what I had said a moment . " You better turn left now , " she mumbled . Making the turn , I said , " I told you , I 'm the intermediary . " " Well , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think you 'd meant anything by it . " " You 're not mad , are you ? " " Look , I 'm not mad ' about anything . " " Turn left and down the block , " she said , in a voice suddenly full of disappointment . The street  --  endless tiny front yards and high brick stoops  --  must have looked no less bleak in the daylight than at night . Trains often pass through miles of just such streets and houses upon enteringand leaving our great cities . In the gutter were five or six Christmas trees still waiting for the garbage man . " There , " Theresa said , and I pulled up near the end of the block . The house she pointed to still had screens on its windows . The radio was playing rock and roll , and Theresa asked if she could stay until the record ended . Her head moved with the beat , and when I looked over at her , I saw that her nose tugged up on her lip so that in profile you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as though she could add two and two . " Who do you like ? " she asked . " Frankie Avalon or l abian ? " " I 'm not sure which is which . " " Well , you were listenin ' to Fabian . " I said that it seemed to me that he could carry a tune . We sat in the radio 's glow for a moment , and then when the record was over , Theresa began to cry . I turned off the motor . " Certain songs make you think of certain people , " she said . " I guess so . " She blew her nose . " Mr. Wallace ? " " What is it ? " " You been so nice . And kind . " " Everything will be all right soon , " I said . " You 're the most polite man I ever met . All that standin ' up and sittin ' down . " " You 're in an unfortunate predicament . " " You do n't need to tell me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my door ? I think I 'm feelin ' funny again . "  |p380She  waited this time until I came around to her side and opened the door ; it had all become a meaningless parody of decency . At the top of the stoop , she took out her keys and let us in . The hallwayhad the tomby smell of an unvacuumed place ; at the rear we came to another door , which she unlocked . Inside I could see the foot of a bed and , on the linoleum floor , a pair of snappy imitationleopardslippers . I said , " Theresa , the next thing will be for Mr. Jaffe  --  " But she had turned and was sniffling again , her frame dropped against my own . I put my hands on her arms . " It 'll be all right . Try to keep control . Mr. Jaffe  --  " " Do I see you again ? " " It 's best for you to see the lawyer  --  " " Do n't I see you again ? " " If it 's necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in and talk to me , Mr. Wallace ? I just feel awful . " She stepped inside and pulled a string ; the bulb lit up four flowered walls , the bed , a cardboard closet  --  a hulking thing that reminded me of Fluke  --  a stained little sink , and a table jammed with soaps and powders . Photographs torn from magazines , all of pudding-faced boys in open-necked shirts , were pinned to the walls . " What 'll happen about the doctor ? " Theresa asked . " I told you . It 'll all be taken care of . " Her coat dropped off her , though I had not seen her undo the dollar-sized buttons . She left it where it lay on the floor , and dropped , sighing , onto the bed . The springs sang , and I could not believe in the blind willfulness of my body 's parts . Theresa hit the bed  --  and my blood responded , as though she were some other woman ; as though she were a woman . " What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought there was more you wanted to talk about back in the restaurant . " " For instance ? " She could n't think of anything ; not right off . " Suppose it 's twins . " " That 's nothing to worry about . " " What d'yuh mean ? People have ' em . Ai n't you never seen twins ? Twin boys or somethin ' ? " " Twins , triplets , or whatever , you have nothing to worry about . " " Suppose it 's a moron. "  | " It 's not going to be a moron , " I said . She seemed to take this as a compliment . " Is there anything more ? " " Well , " she said , " I just thought there was more you wanted to talk about . " " I do n't think there is . " " You been a regular gentleman , Mr. Wallace . You do n't see much of that in the North , you know . " Then her eyes filled up again . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Goodnight , Theresa . " " Mr. Wallace ? " " What ? " " I ai n't never been this way before . I do n't know if I can do it alone . " " I 'm sure it wo n't be as difficult as you imagine . " " What happens when it starts hurtin ' ? I 'm all alone . " " But you 're not alone , you see . " " I sure am . " " I meant to say we 're all trying to help . " " I 'm still alone , " she said . " It ai n't easy for a girl . I 'm always hearin ' people turnin ' my doorknob and all kinds of funny things . There 's always somebody behind me , you know ? I do n't like it alone . " " What is it you 're asking me , Theresa ? " " I do n't know . . . " " Are you asking that I stay with you ? " She looked away from me . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know . " " If you do n't know , do n't provoke . " " I do n't understand you , " she said in a mean , Southern drawl . " I said do n't invite trouble ! " " I do n't understand what you 're shoutin ' for ! Who said you got a right to shout at me ! " I took her blouse button out of my pocket and set it on the foot of the bed . " They 'll get in touch with you , " I said , and holding the door open only for myself , I left , unable to believe in my body 's pulsing , unable to believe in my own temptation.  |p382The  apartment I returned to was not Martha 's but my own  --  cold , musty , and unlived-in . I did not even bother to turn on the lights . The shades were drawn , making it black and to my purposes ; I sat down in my bent-laminated-wood chair and tried to find sense in the lust that had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willed , wanted , or satisfied . I contemplated the desire as though it were the act itself . . . For if in the eyes of the law there is a no man 's land of innocence between the itch and the scratching of it , in the eyes of the citizen himself , who has his own problems , the one may render him just about as culpable as the other . I looked for sense ; I looked for cause . I did not remain alone there in my hat and coat trying to be especially hard on myself  --  hardness or softnesshad little to do with it . I was , I think , in a state of dread . At bottom I did not feel certain about what I would say or do to the next human being I made contact with . I can not say for sure whether , in the bedroom of that unfortunate girl , something had been hooked up inside me or disconnected , but what I knew , what I kit rather , was that within that maze of wiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genitals , some passage of energies , some movement , vital to my being , had taken place . There are those synapses in us between sense and muscle , between blood and feeling , and at tinies , without understanding why , one is aware that a connection that has occurred in oneself  --  or that has failed to occur  --  has beenp383a pure expression of one 's character . And it is that which can bring on the dread . Later , my phone rang . It was Martha and she asked me if I wanted to come home . She said , opening the door , " I 'm sorry I had to get you out . " " I was taking a breather , Martha . " " You were coming back ? " " I think so . " " You did n't know ? " " I did n't know for sure . " " If I 'd realized that , I would n't have called . " " You realized , " I told her , " and you called anyway . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , and left me alone at the door ; a moment followed in which I might have gone back down the stairs and away . I considered it , and then moved into the apartment . It was as though I had been drawn in by that faint Hawaiian House odor that clung to Martha 's uniform ; it was not that I liked the odor particularly , only that I had grown used to it . In the living room she said , " You can even take your coat off . " She sat down beside an ash tray thick with butts . " What were you going to do about all those classy suits ? " " I was going to leave them for the next guy . " " Who were you going to move in with now ? " " To tell you the truth , " I said , " I began to understand hermits . " " You mean you were going to try moving in with the fellas ? " " You 're thinking of monks , Martha . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken ideas . That I 'm not in tune with myself . I was understanding why ascetism was once a basic Western value . " " The old light-hearted historian , " she said . " I would n't worry if I were you . You seem eminently in tune with yourself . " " If I am what you 're trying to say I am , you ought to consider yourself lucky without me . " " I ca n't say I 'm sure what you are . " " Then why did you want me back ? " " I think you want somebody to beat you up tonight , Gabe . I think maybe you 'd better go home after all . " My coat was on my lap and my hat on my head , but I didn'tp384move . I saw only one alternative to running away . " Why do n't we get married , Martha ? " " Oh this is too romantic to bear . " " Why do n't you stop crapping around ? " " Why do n't you !

" " Why do n't you want to get married , Martha ? " " Is this obligation , or impulse , or what ? " " It 's both , if you want to know . All three . " " You do n't want to bring up love or anything , is that it ? " " You 're too full of principles , Mrs. Reganhart . You 're too high-minded . " " Wowee , " she said . " Why do n't you face the facts ? " " Why do n't you ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pertinent fact ? " " Wanting is n't the right word . " " Oh hell then , what is ? Loving is n't the right word and wanting is n't either . Look , buddy , do n't feel obligated . Oh you 've got a nice fat trouble , my friend . " " Why do n't you go sit in the window , Martha , and wait for Mr. Right to come along in his big shoulders and his red convertible ? " " You 're damn right I 'm going to wait ! " " It 's great you 're five nine , Martha , it 's perfect you 're hefty . The bigger they are the better they can enjoy the fall . " " Shut up . " " Your untrammeled , unselfish nobility is about one of the most disgustingly selfish exhibitions I 've ever seen . " " Please do n't you be the one to bring up words like selfish around here , all right ? God might send down thunder on this whole house . Ilave it understood , nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someday somebody 's going to marry me because they want to . ' I'hey 're going to choose little me. "  | " I 'm choosing you . I 'm making the choice . " " There must be some kind of noose around your neck . I ca n't see it , but I know it 's there . " " You 've got circumstances , " I said . " I 've got them too . Do n't be an ass . " " Your circumstance is plain and simple . That is n't what I meant was invisible . " " Go ahead , Martha , you might as well go all the way . " " You do n't need anybody , " she said . " If you did , you would n't feel so obliged all the time . " " You do n't know what I need  --  you do n't begin to know ! " " Nor you , me , " she said flatly . " Then maybe that 's why I was giving some thought to coming back or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , as though I had n't spoken , " ten minutes you 're here and you have n't even asked why I called . " " I did n't think there was a specific reason . " " There is . I 'm not you . I do n't make phone calls out of wistful nostalgia . " Her voice lost a bit of its edge . " Dick Reganhart 's back in town . " For a moment the words meant nothing ; all I could think was that it was the name of some third child of Martha 's . " My first love , " she said . " He wants his kids . I thought you might have a suggestion , " she added ; whereupon she left the room . When I found her in the kitchen she had already poured herself a cup of coffee and was drinking it standing up , looking out the hack window . " What do you mean he wants his children ? " " He wants his children . Simple as that . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it had taken to get from the living room to the kitchen her face had become pouchy with fatigue . She leaned against the window sill . " He 's a great success . New York 's latest fad . You can get yourself a Reganhart by plunking down a thousand bucks . He 's chic , my former husband . He 's grown a mustache . He 's getting married to a millionairess . His new father-in-law was once Ambassador to China . How 's that ? A wife who can use chopsticks . All good things come to him who waits for it . " " The only trouble is he 's got no rights . " " He 's got rights , " she said . " He 's got you . You 're evidence that I 'm an immoral woman . He 's going to take me to court and hold up your underwear as evidence . "  | " He knows about me ? " " There are still creeps around this neighborhood who consider it a pleasure to have smoked pot with my ex-husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . " " Which is n't so . " " Which is . That 's one more fact , since we 're counting facts . " " You saw him then . " " I served him his dinner . He 's still got the old instinct for comedy , " she said . " Tomorrow he 's going to come over and see his kids . " " It does n't make any sense . " I tried to engage her eyes but she looked right past me ; except for the rapidity and brittleness with which she spoke , she gave no sign of falling to pieces . I asked , for lack of anything else to say , " What do you think ? " " That 's what I was going to ask you . " She came over and sat down at the table . " Well , I think it 's ridiculous . " I sat down across from her . " As for my being evidence of your bad character , that 's one of those things that 's got to be proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't the ring of proof . It 's assertion . " She did not answer ; I realized that the first thing I had tried to explain was how I was not implicated . " Well , " I said , " what about his character ? What about all those years of support payments unpaid ? What about the divorce itself ? You ca n't not be a father for six years , five years , whatever it was , and then suddenly decide you 're ready . No judge is going to listen to him , Martha . You 've got Jaffe still , have n't you ? You 've got  --  hell , Martha , it 's an empty threat . " She continued to look unconvinced . " You 're not immoral , " I said . " The power you 've got is the fact that you know it is n't so . " " But it is , " she told me when she saw that I was through . Only her jaw moved as outward evidence that she was not immune to feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gabe . That 's the next fact . " To which I had no ready answer . I got up and poured myself a cup of coffee . Under the sink the garbage pail was overflowing ; I set down my cup and took the pail out and emptied it into the can on the back porch . When I came back in , Martha had left the kitchen and I found her in the empty children 's room on Markie 's bed . " Surprised ? " she said , looking up at me . " No. "  | " Shocked ? Disgusted ? Overcome ? None of the above ? " " None . " " That 's what she wants , is n't it ? " Martha said , throwing a hopelesshand toward Cynthia 's bed . " To live with her father awhile ? Is n't that it , or something like it ? I ca n't tell , I 'm punch-drunk and fed up . I do n't want to worry about what she wants any more . Does that make me a witch ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , you 're standing up there very big and judging , " she said . " I 'll sit down , " and I did , at the end of Cynthia 's bed , across from Martha 's feet . " You know , " she said , " I do n't care . Let him come . Let him open the closets and pull out the drawers and let him find all the God damn underwear he wants . Who can care any more ? All I want is to go out in the afternoon and get a cup of coffee and not have to run back and make anybody 's supper . I used to wheel Markie around the campus all the time , I used to wait for the hour to be up and watch the kids changing classes . That 's how I used to spend the afternoons . Right out there in front of Cobb , rocking my baby carriage . Then I got ashamed and picked myself up and went off to the playground where I belonged . But I do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit it . If I have to push one more swing one more time . . . This is punky of me . " " No . " " I should keep them . I should tell him to take his new life and his new wife and shove them both . Just pay up , 1 should say . Should n't I ? " " What is it , Martha ? What is it you want ? " " Oh , please come here , " she moaned , rolling toward me . " Please , just lie down next to me . Please , and turn off the light . " Beside her , after five minutes of silence , I asked , " How will you feel without those kids ? " " How will you ? " she said . " I 'll marry you either way . " " Do n't say that , will you ? " " Then I do n't know what to say . " " Say I 'm not immoral , all right ? " " You 're not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescoped , " she said , touching my face . " I have n't even known you two months , baby . "  | " What 's the difference ? " " You do n't have to marry me is the difference . Why does everybodyhave to step up and marry me ? I 'm a drag on men . A strain on everybody . Oh Gabe , do you think making love would help matters ? Hold me tighter , okay ? Is that my whole damn downfall  --  hot pants ? Oh let 's just do it , with the doors open and all the grunts and groans and nobody tiptoeing by and nobody 's neuroses blooming down the hall  --  nobody , nothing but our two selves . " Very early in the morning I awoke to find that Martha was no longer beside me in Markie 's bed . I supposed she had gone back to her own room , but I found her barefooted in the hallway , bending over the large cedar chest in which the kids ' old toys were stored . The toys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in the hall ; in their place Martha was packing away my belongings  --  shirts , suits , coats , underwear , ties  --  and hiding them out of sight . The next morning Mrs. Baker ushered us into her kitchen ( hers until her daughter came out of Billings ' psycho ward ) and in a cheery , **32;3384;TOOLONG voice heralded our arrival . " Look who 's come ! It 's Markie and Cindy 's mommy , and Mr. Wal-lach . " The three Parrino offspring , sullen children with downy faces , took our appearance in their stride ; hardly a face rose out of its cereal bowl despite their grandmother 's exuberance . Cynthia , however , never without resources for drama , jumped up from the table and leaped half the length of the kitchen . She threw her arms around Martha . " Daddy 's here ! " she cried . " How do you know , baby ? " " Is n't he ? " she demanded . " Did he go , already ? " " No , no  --  he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He called me , " she said . " Ask Mrs. Baker . Did n't my daddy call me here ? " A white-haired woman with pale hands and active fingers , who always moved around the house in full dress  --  weighty oxfords , fur jacket , and pink pillbox hat , veil up  --  Mrs. Baker gave a small birdlikereply , as though she were cracking a seed in her teeth . " That 's right , dear . Last night at eleven-thirty . " " Well , I did n't know that , sweetie . " Martha managed to maintainher composure in the face of Dick Regenhart 's surprises and energies . " I 'll bet you were excited . Does Mark know ? "  | " He gets confused , Mother . " Martha went to the table and smoothed back the boy 's cowlick . " How are you , young man ? Did you have fun sleeping over ? Did you talk to Daddy ? " He looked confused all right . " I was sleeping , " he said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you 're going to visit with Daddy . " " Oh terrific , " Cynthia said . Mark and the Parrino children said nothing . " Hello , Stephanie , " I said . " How are you ? " Mrs. Baker said , " Stephanie 's daddy and Tony 's daddy and Stevie 's daddy is going to visit with them next month , is n't that right , honey ? " She had made it sound like three people . Stephanie nodded , and Cynthia , on the edge of her seat , said , " Do we go now ? " " Do n't be impolite . You finish your breakfast , " Martha said , " and we 'll wait in the other room . " Mrs. Baker followed us , and when Martha and I had settled onto the sofa , she said , " Mr. Reganhart wanted to come over last night "  --  she had been looking only at Martha , but I now got a significantglance as well  --  " and I thought it over and weighed all sides and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those two children . Now I hope I did n't do wrong , honey . I did n't know how you felt about it . I did n't want to call you and wake you up too . I know when Billy comes , I just think it overexcites the children . " She had a very excited , anticipatory air about herself , as though there was always the possibility that she might be strung up for her last statement . She seemed to sense some acute division between herself and the general drift of life . " Thank you , " Martha said . " I think you were right . " " You do n't want to disrupt their sleep , " the older woman said , this time only to me . " I do n't know how you folks feel , but personally eleven-thirty does n't seem to me an hour for telephoning all around town . " " I suppose he was anxious to talk to them , " Martha said . " You 're perfectly right , Martha , " said Mrs. Baker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy certainly loves his children one hundred percent too . I did n't mean they did n't love their little ones . What kind of men would they be then ? " Again the question was for me . " Billy 's certainly been very good while Bev 's been recuperating , I do n't mean that . It 's just that they 're not women and you ca n't expectp390that they 're going to understand a child the way a woman can . You men are our wage-earners and our husbands , " Mrs. Baker told me , " but there 's nobody like a mother . " I agreed . She squared the edge of a pile of magazines on top of the TV set . " These are mine , you know  --  for Bev . " She held up a magazine before her , as a child will hold up something for the entire class to see , facing each of us in turn . " These are my genealogical journals of Illinois , Mr. Wallach . My daughter has gotten very interested in her family history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , Martha , Beverly never much cared about DAR matters . But I suppose now she 's had all that time to think and so forth , and to appreciate , and well , we think it 's a good sign . I had to go all the way out to Highland Park the other day to bring in all my books and magazines , but I 'd make a hundred trips back and forth a week if we can have our girl back the way she was . She even asked about you , Martha Lee . " " Did she ? " Martha said . " That 's very sweet . " " Oh she talks about her daddy and her brothers , and her old old friends  --  little children all grown up by now  --  and about you , Martha Lee , and about Richard too  --  that 's Mr. Reganhart , " Mrs. Baker informed me . " In fact , she 's suggested  --  and it was all her suggestion , mind you  --  that I try to get hold of a genealogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , Martha Lee . Now is n't that something ? I 've already written off to see what we can do . Would n't you call that reason to be cheered up ? " " She sounds like she 's coming along , " Martha said . " Well , the doctors are encouraged , and the children are managingbeautifully , and I do n't mean to say that Billy has n't been a help . We have nothing against Billy , " she said , " per se . If a marriagedoes n't work , it does n't work , I suppose . Perhaps we 'll find out later that this was all for the best . " Neither Martha nor I responded . " Mr. Wallach , " Mrs. Baker said , " I was myself married to two of the finest men who ever drew breath . And I lost them both , that was God 's will . " She filled up instantly with tears . " But I went right ahead , and Beverly is going to go right on , and Martha Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman . To go right on , and raise her children to be strong and good , and not to be ashamed , and to respect their elders and love their country . I had two fine husbands , both of them Masons , not strong lodge men , I 'll admit that ,  |p391but  men 's men , who had the respect of their neighbors and knew their duty to their wife . After all , the husband chooses the wife , he gets down on bended knee  --  at least he used to  --  and then he 's got the duty to stand by her . Would n't you say ? " " Yes , " I said . " I do n't know what 's happened to the world , Mr. Wallach . If you 'll pardon me , I do n't mean this personally , but I do n't know what 's happened to our American men . I do n't understand this discontentmentbusiness and I ca n't say that I ever have . I do n't know what men want any more . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but heaven knows they do n't make them any smarter or any prettier than you , honey . And my own Bev , they did n't make them any sweeter , you can attest to that , Martha Lee . The sweetest , kindest girl , loved animals , loved the seasons and her schoolwork , Queen of the Prom , I remember that , and a pretty girl too  --  and it 's just not imaginable what this world has turned around and given them . Now I do n't know Mr. Richard Reganhart except by name , and Billy has been very courteous through this whole ordeal , but I do n't think they either of them would know a good thing if they tripped over it . If they fell over it and broke their neck , as Mr. Baker used to say . " Cynthia 's voice came lancelike down the hall from the kitchen : Markie and Stevie were throwing Farina . " Oh dear , " said Mrs. Baker , and she flustered and fidgeted until Martha rose and went off to the kitchen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journals , Mrs. Baker leaned in the direction of the disturbance ; when the situation seemed under control , she came over and sat down next to me , where Martha had been . " They 're two fine children , " she said . " That Cindy is smart as a whip . " " She 's very good at looking after Markie , " I said . " They could make a man a very nice little family , " Mrs. Baker said , " believe me . " Again I nodded my head , agreeing . " I do n't know if you 're a Mason or not , Mr. Wallach , and I do n't want to pry . " " I 'm not . " " Well , " she said , " I would certainly give it some thought . I 'm not going to say much more , because if a man wants to become ap392Mason that 's up to him . You know you wo n't even be invited , you know that ? " " No , I did n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit around waiting . They do n't believe in that . If a man decides he wants to be a Mason , then he 's got to step forward . Now I would n't try to convince you of anything , Mr. Wallach . I 'm only saying I think you might give it some thought . You know what they say : Once a Mason , always a Mason . ' I was married to two men , both Masons , and both fine men , Mr. Wallach , respected in the community and in the home as well . They were stern men , and maybe they did n't wipe the dishes like some husbands do , but they knew right from wrong . You just ask over at the University  --  you teach , is n't that it , over at the Univer-sity ? " " Yes . " " Well , you just ask around there . You talk to the top professors and you see if they 're not Masons  --  the top professors , and deans , and so on . " " I will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cynthia and Mark in their coats and the three Parrino children  --  hot cereal having cut through their gloom  --  running up and down the hallway , Mrs. Baker took my hand and whispered to me , " They 'd make a man a nice fine little family , do n't think they would n't . " In the back seat Martha sat beside her daughter ; Mark and the little suitcase full of pajamas and comic books that the children had taken with them to the Parrinos were in front with me . After a momentary crisis on the street  --  Mrs. Baker all the while waving at us from upstairs  --  we had all submitted to Markie 's seating arrangement . " He 's traveled all the way from New York to see you , " Martha was saying now , " and he wants to have a good time with you , okay ? " Uncooperatively , Cynthia mumbled that she would cooperate . Martha leaned forward , so that her hand was on my coat . " Okay ? " " Okay , " Markie answered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Martha said , " To help him have a good time , babies , I do n't think he wants to hear about some things . I think he wants to hear about school ,  |p393and  the playground , and about your Christmas presents , and about Markie 's cold that he had , and Cynthia 's ballet lessons  --  " " What does n't he want to hear about ? " Cynthia asked . " I do n't think , for instance , he wants to hear about Sid Jaffe , you know  --  or about Gabe , " she said . " I do n't think that 's important to Daddy on such a short visit . " No one asked a question , not Mark , Cynthia , or me . " Do you understand , Markie ? " " Okay , " he said , shrugging . " I do n't think Daddy 's interested that Gabe stays with us overnight . You see ? If Daddy asks about Gabe you say he visits with Mother . Okay , honey ? " Mark leaned over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered . " Oh but just a small secret , that 's all , " Martha said . " You 'll have plenty to talk about without worrying about such a little secret . Agreed , Cyn ? " We waited , and then that small guardian of truth swung her great lantern over us all . " Gabe does sleep over . Gabe 's clothes are home . " " But for the time being , Gabe 's clothes are put away . Cyn , Gabe sleeps over , but I think that 's our private life . Your father has his private life , and we have ours . Is n't that so ? " " Okay . " " Look , Cynthia  --  you have a perfect right to disapprove . You go ahead and think whatever you want . Even if you want to he angry , then you be angry . You have a private life too . I 'm only asking you to please do what I tell you , because I think it 'll make us all happier . Baby-love , I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ? " " I 'm not angry , " the child said . " That 's good , Cynthia  --  that 's a terrific girl . And this afternoonI 'm going to have a talk with Daddy , and Gabe 's going to take you to the Museum . " " The Aquarium , " Mark demanded . " The Museum of Science and Industry , honey , " Martha said . " You can go down in the coal mine . " " We 've been down in that coal mine , " Cynthia said , " about a hundred times . " " I want the fish , " Mark said . " Oh hell , Markie , do n't whine  --  not today  --  " began Martha ,  |p394and  then , making my first statement of the morning to the assembled Reganharts , I said sharply , " If he wants to go the Aquarium , we 'll go to the Aquarium . What 's so hard about that ? " To the consternation of all of us , Mark grabbed my arm and kissed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back seat , even Cynthia , champion of unconditional surrender , broke down and said , " Thank you . " She said it softly , and when I turned my head to tell her she was welcome , I found the child , miraculously , giving me a sympathetic , almost a pitying , look . After driving Martha and the children home , I drove to my office , where I spent the rest of the morning marking freshman essays . Just before I went off to lunch  --  and from there to pick up Martha 's kids  --  I dialed the Herzes . " Is she terribly upset ? " asked Libby . " I think everything 's under control , " I said . " Do you have any message for Paul ? " " Whatever I tell you I would tell Paul . " " We 're very appreciative , " she said , " about Mr. Jaffe . " " That 's fine . " " Is she young ? " she asked . Then : " Is she attractive ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Libby . She 's nineteen . " " What about the husband ? " " What ? " " The father . Is he a student ? " " No , " I said . " I thought he was a student too . " " He 's an architect , " I said . She said , " And he 's not going to get in the way ? " " I do n't think so . " " So we can just sit back now ? " " That 's right . " " Well . . . it sounds very good . I did n't realize he was an architect . " " It 's all perfect , " I said . After a moment , she said , " I want to say I 'm sorry for my out-burst . " " " I hat 's neither here nor there , Libby . " " And how is Mrs. Reganhart ? "  | " She 's fine . " " Do you want Paul to call you about anything ? " " Jaffe will call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we 're very appreciative . " " Of course , " I said , and hung up . It was like being under water , though perhaps that was some illusion I brought to the place , something to do with my sense that day of power and circumstance . At any rate , the corridors arched over , containing our movements , and the oblongs of light which gave a shape , an edge , to the darkness could have been glass-bottomed boats looking in on us ; not even the noises were above-ground sounds . Everything  --  footfalls , laughter , parental reprimands  --  seemed to pulsate toward one vertically and then break under and over . Mark kept leaning across the railing and rapping on the windows of the tanks to get the attention of the fish . A guard finally told him to cut it out . " You get an angel fish excited , " the guard advised me , since it was I who would have to fork over the cash , " he 'll knock his head against the wall and kill himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we walked on , up one side , past the long metallic fish of the Great Lakes , and down the other , past their rainbowed cousins of the Amazon and Nile . Long-legged Cynthia , a little Egyptian herself in an orange chemise dress and a purple pullover , seemed to pick up grace from watching the patient Mutterings of the fins and the rippling gills of the baby shark , as he slid one way and then the other in his green cage . " They eat people , " Cynthia informed her brother , and then she did something on her toes that she had learned in her ballet class , and coasted on . It was a simple enough sentence she had uttered , but I do n't think the remark sank in . Mark ran off across the marble floor and disappeared around the corner ; we came on him later in front of the sea horse , which he thought was a toy . I was the most permissive of adults , and followed where they led ; and though other families arrivedand departed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my companions  --  the two unruly children , screaming and skipping up and down the echoing halls  --  were home having a long talk , the outcomeof which none of us yet knew . Finally , tired out , I sat down on a bench in front of the hawksbill turtle , a bundle of coats and hatsp396and scarves in my lap . The hawknose dipped and the ancient repulsiveskin of the turtle 's neck flashed by , and then the armored bottom went sailing past the window . He receded into the murky waters at the far reaches of the tank , and Markie settled down beside me and promptly fell asleep , his head on my arm . Cynthia approachedand asked , so politely , if she could take off her shoes . " They 're very nice shoes , " I said . " They 're Indian girls ' shoes from Arizona , " she said . " Are they too tight ? " " No , they 're perfect . " Nevertheless , one beaded shoe dangled from either hand . " Why do n't you sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor is a little cold . " " Thank you . " She seated herself not beside Markie , but me . " They are a little tight , " she admitted . " That 's the way the Indian children like them . " " They 're very colorful and pretty , " I said . " My father brought them . " " Did he bring you the dress too ? " " And the sweater . They 're from June . " " I see . " " Do you know who June is ? " she asked . " I suppose she 's his new wife , who he 's going to marry . " " She 's very pretty , " Cynthia said . " Did you see a picture ? " " In an evening gown . " " Did Mark ? " I asked . " Mark does n't understand everything , " she said . " I think we might get to live in New York , " she told me . " Your daddy said so ? " " He asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . Cynthia pulled one foot up on the bench and began to knead her big toe . " I suppose my parents are having a talk about us , " she said . " I suppose they are . " " I 'm not sure Markie wants to go live in New York . " " Why not ? " " I do n't think he knows my father very well . My father has a new mustache . " " Does n't Mark like the mustache ? "  | " I do n't think he 's used to it . " " I 'll bet if you lived with him he 'd probably get used to it . " She considered that . " He did n't used to have one . " " Well , " I said after a moment , " people change and I guess we finally do get used to it . " " But he would n't be home with us , you see , " Cynthia said . " He works . " " All fathers work , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her next question had a fervent , open inquisitiveness about it , and it connected in my mind with that nearly tender glance she had given me in the car , and the fact that she had chosen now to sit down beside me . On this of all days I had stopped being only her mother 's property . " Is he a painter ? " she asked me . " He 's a dentist . " " Ucch , " said Cynthia . " He does n't hurt though , " I said . " He 's a painless dentist . " For the first time in our short and disheartening acquaintanceshipshe tried to please me . " Boy , I 'd like him to be my dentist . " " He lives in New York too . " What she said then might at first appear to have emerged more appropriately from the mouth of her brother ; but the words belonged to Cynthia really , for she was the metaphysical one . " Is he any relation to me ? " she asked . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off one another then and turned them upon that giant turtle , whose spinnings , past our gaze and back , over and over and over ( endlessly , even after closing time , when no one was there ) , seemed nature 's inspiration for the self 's most urgent dreams . Chasing nothing , pursued by nothing , powerless to discontinue his own frantic rounds . The sight of him produced in me the kind of nervousness that makes some people want to scream and others get up and walk away as fast as they can . Cynthia said , " Are you ? " " What ? " " Related to me . " " Well , " I said , " I 'm your friend . " " I do n't think I like my father 's mustache , " she told me , and stood up and walked in her white anklets over to the turtle 's tank . When she came back , I asked her to mind Mark , and I walked down the long corridor and found a phone booth by the tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all come home now , " and so we three left the Aquarium and came out , above water , into the silverp398light of that February afternoon , with downtown Chicago , the skyline to our right , looking as eternal as a city can . In her purple suit  --  worn , I began to feel , only for historic occasions  --  andwith her hair coiled up on her head , and sporting very high-heeled shoes , Martha looked solid and monumental , the type of girl who occasionally wins a beauty contest by sheer physical intimidationof the judges . Her face was lined again , as it was not in the morning but had been the night before . At the sight of the three of us , however , her manner was cheery and untrammeled . " Hi . How were the fish ? Did anybody fall in ? " " Where is he ? " Mark asked . " Who ? " The boy shrugged . " Him . " " He went back to his hotel , " Martha told him . " I want milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in the kitchen for you , all ready . Do n't spill it on your nice suit , Markie . Hi , Cynthia , you want some milk ? " In the car , driving back from the Aquarium , I had been afraid I might say the wrong words to Cynthia and turn her back into herself . But she had managed the turning on her own . " I do n't want those lousy chocolate grahams , I 'll tell you that . Why ca n't we ever have regular grahams ? " " Chocolate grahams , " I said , " are supposed to be extra special . " But the magic clearly had gone out of me , and I was left with only the stickiness of the remark and the vision of Cynthia , swishing her coat back over one shoulder and moving off into the kitchen with an unambiguous display of feeling . From the other room we could alreadyhear her brother exhaling over his milk . " How were the fish ? " asked Martha , turning her back on the latest installment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they liked it . " Martha sat down on the couch and crossed her legs , so that what light filtered in through the windows caught the sheen along the meaty side of her stockings . After carefully lighting a cigarette she removed a speck of tobacco from her tongue , a gesture dense , it turned out , with sexuality . She seemed to have worked up a decided air about herself . Perhaps it was only that I had grown so used to seeing her in uniforms , slacks , slips , and nightgowns , that I was confusingthe elegance of her costume with some heightened emotionalp399condition ; yet cross-legged , expelling smoke , sipping brandy from one of the two glasses that had been set on the floor , she seemed to be wilfully charging the place with protestations of her womanliness . Even when she spoke , it was like one who has decided to give expression to a part of his character to which others , he feels , have not attended sufficiently in the past . The tone was artificial and vaguely defiant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , thanks . " " Do you mind if I . . . ? " " Of course not . " But then Cynthia and Mark were at it in the kitchen . " Grahams ! " " Chocolate grahams ! " " Grahams ! " " Stop it ! " Martha shouted , and the bubble in which she had been trying to sit and sip her brandy instantly burst . " Please stop it , " she cried , " the two of you ! Ca n't you treat each other like a brother and sister ! " " He stinks , " Cynthia shouted back , and the door slammed to her bedroom . In the silence that followed , I realized that the radio that was usually in the kitchen was behind me somewhere in the living room , and that it was softly playing . It was Saturday ; in New York they were performing The Magic Flute . Dick Reganhart and his former wife  --  so as to lay the ground rules of their meeting , give it the dignity of their years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During all those years that Martha had been living her life in Oregon , I had been in New York living mine . . . This observation was pedestrian enough , but the emotion that accompanied had considerableforce . So did the recollection of the long-gone Saturdays in my life , of my mother lying on the sofa , listening to the music , and of me stretched out on the rug doing my schoolwork , and at the window , his hair the color of the sunless eastern sky , my father looking down at Central Park , which was locked in the ferocity of one New York season , or turning blade by blade into another . We had had what Mrs. Baker would call a nice fine little family , and whatever my parents ' aches and pains , there had nevertheless been a comfortingnet about the three of us , and the permanence of its disappearancesuddenly set loose in me a longing that rose and rose , until my hand , as though afloat on the floodlike emotion , moved up and onto Martha 's breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ip400who was seeking support in her flesh , was surely nothing I could expect her to appreciate . The arc of her throat was all I saw move . " He 's taking them , " she said . " Okay , " I said . " Then let 's get out . " She crushed her cigarette in the ash tray ; she jumped up ; she smoothed her skirt ; she was trying to grin ; perhapswithout even being aware of it , she was clapping her palms together . " Well , let 's get out . Let 's go . Fresh air . I 'll get my coat . " She went out of the room to the telephone . " You kids go down to Barbie 's , " I heard her say after hanging up . " Just go right down the back stairs . We 'll be home in a little while . " " Where you going ? " " Cynthia , you hold Markie 's hand going down the stairs . Come on , Barbie 's waiting for you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gabe 's going to take your mother for a walk . " We walked in the only direction one can walk for the sake of pleasure or diversion or speculation in Chicago  --  toward the lake . The wind came straight into our faces , and the four-o'clock sun could barely illuminate the circle of sky around it , let alone make itself felt against our backs . We passed under the I.C. tracks and walked beyond the hotels and tennis courts and through the underpass beneath the drive . Then , still arm in arm and silent , we saw the water , which before our eyes went a color just this side of black , as though a heavy tarpaulin had been dropped over it . Private and alone , in the midst of the elements , we watched the gyrating gulls . " There 's a ship out there , " Martha said . " Where ? " " Way out  --  over by Michigan . " " Yes , " I said , not seeing it . " I suppose , " she said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " " If you wanted to . " " He 's supposed to be changed , Gabe . He 's got this big Italian mustache . " " So Cynthia said . " " How does she like it ? "  | " I think she likes it , " I said . " Oh sure , he 's a regular image for a growing child . ht 's the pitch . That he 's not the same old Dick . That 's supposed somehow to make me heartbroken and nostalgic for all the times l got slugged . " I did not ask , and Martha did not say , whether the pitch was simply a pitch . " I do n't think I 'll tell the kids for a few days . All right ? " " Sure , " I said . " Maybe I can lead into it . Maybe we can lead into it . " What could I do ? Offer to marry her again ? For Martha , had that ever been the issue ? " I 'll do whatever I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gall to say was that it would be a favor to all of us to get the kids out of this environment . I do n't know whether he meant me or the paint flaking off the ceiling . He 's gotten very fancy . You know , he came in sort of shooting his cuffs , flashing the links , and so on . And the girl looks very upper-class Bryn Mawr and horsey . Rich . Wallet-sized photos by Bachrach . He suggested that money was good for children . " " He said that ? " " He 's a very straightforward fellow . I was going to ask if he 'd always known it or if his friends had been keeping it a secret from him for four years . " " Why did n't you ? " " It was n't that kind of meeting . I even thought he was going to try to kiss me once or maybe feel me up . " " He did n't . " " He did n't . " " Did you want him to ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared him . " " So it was n't a mess ? " " Quite clean . He does n't even curse any more . " " No fighting , then ? No threats ? " She closed her eyes , making her admission . " What was there to fight about ? " At bedtime , Mark offered his lips as usual , and Cynthia as usual turned her cheek , but when my mouth came down to it she whispered some words that I could not understand . Because Martha was only a foot behind me , I did not ask the child to repeat whatever it was she had said . Later we went to bed ourselves , and while we each waited patiently for sleep to put an end to the day , Martha finally asked me how it had gone with Theresa Haug.  |p402In  the middle of March they left us . It had been possible during the week before to arouse Markie 's interest and keep it pumped up with exotica about the Empire State Building and Coney Island , plus occasional tales from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little boy in New York , " says Martha , and " Oh yes , " I say , " we went on the subway and we went  --  " Cynthia was not so easy to manipulate , being an ace practitioner of the art herself . She began to tease . " I 'll bet there are n't as many colored kids in my class , " she said . In a letter on blue vellum her new stepmother had informed her that she had been accepted as a student at a private school on West Eleventh Street . She would not even lose a term . " Private school is better anyway , " Cynthia said . " Private schools are very good , " Martha said . " Which kind did you go to ? " It was not the first time that we heard the question . Martha did not even look up from the bed upon which she was separating those items of Markie 's wardrobe that were in need of repair . " I could n't ntford to go to school . I delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ; she was back minutes later . however , and addressed a statement to the woman who bore her though that lady were Zephyr himself . " I 'll bet it 's not so damn windy in New York , " she said . " I 'll het it 's not , " Martha said . " Do n't say damn . "  | " You do . " " I 'm an adult  --  " " I 'm an adult , you 're a child , " Cynthia mimicked , and moved off with a swift swooping grace , a submarine speeding home for more torpedoes . Martha tossed a pair of holey socks into the wastebasket at her feet . " Is n't she the brainy little saboteur , " she said , a judgment , not a question , and another pair of socks followed the first . " What 's private school ? " asked Mark , one eye on the diminishingpile of clothes . " Private school is what you pay for  --  oh , Markie , come here , why do you wear this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this underwear if it 's ripped in the back ? " " Who ? " " You . Your underpants are ripped . Why did n't you say something ? Do you want to show up at your father 's with ripped under-wear ? " The child , bewildered , slid his hand down the back of his trousers . " And take your hand out of there , " said Martha , bone weary . Markie began to bawl . " Oh baby , it 's Mommy 's fault , " Martha said , dropping a handful of shorts , " it 's my fault , I 'm a slob and oh Markie  --  " She smothered him with kisses while he beat on her face with his hands . " Oh it 's not your fault it 's ripped , baby , it 's mine oh hell  --  " Day after day tempers were short , tears frequent , and apologies effusive and misdirected . But finally we were driving to the airport . " I sit in front with Mommy and Gabe , " Mark said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an afterthought . " Me , " the boy said . " Look , I do n't like three in front , " I said . Martha said nothing at all ; she had already slid in beside the driver 's seat . " I 'd get to sit in front anyway , " Cynthia said , " because I 'm older . " " I 'm older , " Mark said . " You 're stupid , " his sister told him . " Stop it , will you ? " I said . " Calm down , both of you . " We proceeded down Fifty-fifth Street in silence , until overhead we could hear the planes circling to land . " We 're almost there and 1 never sat in front yet , " Cynthia said . " Just little stinky Markie. "  |p404Martha  only looked at the license plate of the car in front of us . " Please , Cynthia , " I said . " Let 's try to be generous to each other . " " Oh sure , " she said . Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We ca n't all sit in front , can we ? Just stop it . " The only comment was Markie 's . " Ha ha , " he said . At the airport parking lot , I carried three of the suitcases ; Martha , hanging a few steps behind , carried the fourth . Inside the terminal , Cynthia displayed a considerable interest in the departure proceedings . She watched the scales to see how much each piece of luggage weighed , and she made sure that the proper tags were tied to the handles . As the suitcases joggled down the moving platform , she followed them with her eyes until they were out of sight . Then she inquired of the ticket girl if there were toilets and ice water on the plane . " Is there someone there to pick them up ? " asked the girl behind the counter . " My father , " Cynthia said . The girl behind the counter smiled her girl-behind-the-counter smile . " All right then , " she said , and told us which gate the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Mark to the terminal bathroom , where , turning to ask me , " Hey , who owns us ? " he managed to pee all over my cuff . When we came out Martha and Cynthia were standing at the newspaper stand , flipping through magazines . The angle of their heads , the way they supported themselves on their legs and moved their arms , would have indicated to anybody that they were mother and daughter . Neither of them was reading or even looking at the pictures . As I approached , Cynthia reached into her little red purse and asked the newsdealer for a copy of Life . She paid for it with a handful of pennies of her own , and it was then that I saw Martha 's composure weaken . " I have to sit over the wing , " Cynthia told me as we started down the corridor to the departure gate . " I get sick any place else . " " I thought you never flew before . " " I know I 'll get sick any place else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , catching up to her brother , who was skipping down to the gate , handsome in his new hat , coat , and suit sent from Lord &; Taylor 's in New York . On the plane I had to ask several people if they would move so that Cynthia would have a place over the wing . Markie slid inp405beside her and immediately grabbed all the paraphernalia in the pocket before him ; most of it fell to the floor . He waved the paper bag up toward Martha . " A bag , " he said . Cynthia took it from his hand and returned it to the slot . A blond stewardess  --  running , it appeared , for number-one charmer of the airways  --  gave us a look at all her teeth . " Everything hunkydoryup here ? " she asked . " Fine , " I said . " I 'm afraid you folks will have to be going now , " she said . But at this point Martha pushed past her  --  she had been standingaside till then , letting me do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children the jacket of her suit hiked up , showingwhere her slip was weakening at the seam . She had put on six or seven pounds in the last month ; she was big , and not very pretty . " Goodbye , babies . Now , you write letters , hear ? You 've got the stamps in your suitcase and all the envelopes are addressed . You just write the letters , all right ? And take care of your brother , Cyn . You listen to Cynthia , Mark . Be nice to each other , all right ? " " We 're nice to each other , " Cynthia insisted . " I know , " Martha said , kissing them both . She turned , and without even a glance at me , left the plane . I leaned down one last time , and Cynthia asked if I was going to marry Martha . " We 'll see , " I said . " I 'm glad we two became friends , Cynthia . " She toughened instantly . " I 'm always friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodbye , Mark . Be a good boy . Send me a card from the Statue of Liberty . " Some connection was made . " Coney Island ! " Markie shouted , and I started down the aisle of the plane . The blond stewardess said to me , " We 'll take extra good care of them , you bet . " Minutes later we watched the plane taxi up the field , and then it was aloft , without incident . Martha said that she would just as soon not go right back to the apartment , and so we took a long ride that afternoon , all the way out to Evanston to look at the big trees and the pretty houses . Finally it was dark and we had to go home.  |p408Of  course he had been miserable . Between the pretension and the fact , what 's invented and what 's given , stands one 's own tortured soul . Paul Herz had been pretending all these awful years that he was of another order of men . It occurred to him now  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard night of endless dripping  --  that , no , he was not a man of feeling ; it occurred to him that if he was anything at all it was a man of duty . And that when his two selves had become confused  --  one self , one invention  --  when he had felt it his duty to be feeling , that then his heart had been a stone , and his will , instead of turning out toward action , had remained a presence in his body , a concrete setting for the rock of his heart . It all led to a very heavy sense of self  --  an actual sensation of these last years  --  to a weird textual consciousness of what stood between him and others , a weighted-down feeling under the burden of underwear , tie , shirt , jacket , and coat ; a sense of the volume of air itself . Nowhere was it worse than in bed with his wife ; paradoxically , undressed was worse than dressed , by a long shot . Beneath the sheets he was made particularly aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his little fingers and toes , all the hard extremitiesof his body , were like little steel caps . The dancer has a sense of flow into the world  --  he felt blunt . The only hard extremity in which he felt soft was his penis . Though it rose on occasion to duty 's call , and on rarer occasion to feeling 's provocation , for the most part it seemed to have retired from active life . He might almost havep409forgotten about it had he not had reason ( getting in and out of bed each day with a woman ) to think about it so much . In adolescence , of course , one of his burdens had been his erection ; it had seemed to him his cross to bear . Getting off buses he had tried slouching ; along the corridors at school he had covered himself with his threeringnotebook ; at the urinal , one out of two times he was peeing up in the air . But now at twenty-seven , in a state apparently of hormonal balance , or loss , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his seat in the dark coach , he thought about getting up and going into the rocking bathroom at the end of the car and stimulatinghimself . It was not simply the movement of the train that suggested the idea ; he had entertained it , and succumbed to it , in the past , at home when Libby was out ; there had even been times with Libby sleeping in the other room . It was not so much an act of defiance , or spite , or even perversion , as of conviction : I am a man yet . But afterwards it was not usually that of which he was convinced ; afterwardsit was as though the milk of life itself had drained out of him , and he slumped onto the toilet seat a hollow thing , as though if he were to crack a bone upon the bathroom tile , the dull ringing of his body would reverberate through the house , even to the ears of his wife . The train was dragging to a stop . Outside it was black and beginning to rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masturbate While Train Is In Station . He responded to neither duty nor feeling , just common sense . There was nothing to he gained by making a bad thing worse . No ? Then why was he headed East ? The telegram had come to him at the University . He had put it in his pocket and gone about his business , which , that afternoon , was to journey down to LaSalle Street and talk to the lawyer . He had given Jaffe a check for thirty-six dollars , covering three visits that the girl had made to the obstetrician . Of course , had it been Libby 's own pregnancy there would have been Blue Cross and Blue Shield to cover expenses ; now , following their uninsured crisis in Pennsylvania , he was insured to the teeth  --  but now it was not his wife 's hospital bills he was going to have to pay . None of their dealings with doctors had ever come under normal headings anyway , items the insurance companies recognized . But then little in his life had come under normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , he had only recently been introduced to Jaffe and he did not want to appear unappreciative , or self-pitying . He had handed over the money , smiling , and Jaffe had assured him thatp410the obstetrician had assured Jaffe that it was a perfectly normal pregnancy . But if it 's a normal pregnancy keep smiling , this is for free why must she go to see him so often ? She 's nervous , Jaffe answered impatient with me ? Well , it 's my money , it 'll be my baby she needs reassuring , that 's all . Excuse me , Paul , I 've got a client waiting I 'm a client , I came all the way down here , I 'm nervous , I need reassuring  --  hey , how much more is this going to cost  --  Thank you , Sid , thanks for everything something for nothing , be nice , you pauper , we appreciate , we appreciate , I 'm deeply appreciative get out , he 's got a client waiting , smile and go home . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had begun to make a scene over something ( oh yes , he never listened to her any more  --  which he did n't ) , and he had only pulled it from his pocket and tossed it on the table so as to alter the course of events . " Here ! This is why I 'm preoccupied . Sure , I 'm preoccupied  --  here , read this ! " " Oh Paul , " said Libby , reading , " what are we going to do ? " " We 'll do what we have to do  --  what I have to  --  " Duty ! Screw duty ! Feeling ! Are n't you a student of letters ? A teacher of Dostoevsky ? Puller of long faces , booster of The Brothers K ? Enemy of Spigliano and the legions of reason ? Are you not a writer of prose fiction , all heartfelt ? No ! Are you not the high priest of love ? No ! Were you ever ? No ! No ! What an idea of himself he had constructed ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to do , Libby  --  nothing ! I 'm under no obligation , absolutely none . Well , what do you think ? What are you crying about now ? " " Oh , " she wept , " you have no  --  " From time to time he had to do what he did then . " I 've got feelings ! " he roared , having smacked her . " I 've got feelings that tell me he could live without me , so he can die without me too ! " With the red mark on her pale cheek , she cried less , not more , which was why , having hit her that first time some years back , he had come to do it again : it worked . In their six years he had not indulged himself on more than four or five occasions . He did not quite know what to make of this set of facts  --  divide five into six and compareto the national average ? To get what ? How was he to measure her assault upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned out to be a weakling ? What about her handicap ? As had happened on the four or five previous occasions , he was now filled with remorse . Libby was sitting with her coffee cup , leafing through her Jewish homemaker 's book ; she was n't crying , justp411deadly silent . " What are you looking up ? " he asked softly , " a name ? Does it give a list of names ? " She nodded ; three fingers still showed on her cheek ; now two ; now one . " Well , which do you like ? " Now , thank God , none . " What do you like , Lib ? " " What about Nahum ? " " For a boy , " he asked , " or a girl ? " " A boy . " She did more than answer  --  she smiled . Oh I 'm coming back into her good graces . I need your good graces , oh yes 1 do , Libby . " It means comfort , " she said . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herz ? Does that sound , I do n't know , perfect to you ? " " I think so . " " Well it 's nice , honey , " he said skeptically . " I suppose it 's a nice old name  --  " " If your father dies , do we have to name it after your father ? " " We do n't have to do anything , Libby . " " I thought you might want to . " There ! How many points does she get for that ? He rose from the table ; she was incurably  --  what , stupid or destructive , naive or mean ? " Libby , I want him to die ! He should die , if there 's any justice in this world . He 's ruined our life ! " But shame came in , like a rolling of waves , and carried with it the truth : I ruined it . Me . The following day he went to see Spigliano and told him he had to go East for a few days . He waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying , " answered Paul gravely . Oh gravity ! What a lie . I am a man of feeling , Spigliano , and you are not . I am at one with old Fyodor and you are  --  Bullshit . I am you . And that evening , at the end of the third day , he had boarded the overnight coach to New York ; why , he was not certain , though the blackness of Ohio  --  they were moving again , heads lolling on the seats around him  --  and the rushing of the train , the telegram in his pocket , the knowledge of what he had left behind , the uncertaintyof what he was moving into , all produced in him now a sense of the profundity of the moment . But what ? How ? Why was he allowing himself to be borne through space at a rapid rate on a dark night ? To where ? In the morning the dawn began to lift just outside of Philadelphia . He made his way down the car to the washroom , and when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was as though the sky and sun held fast while the earth spun out of its darkness into light . Andp412then he realized that this was exactly what happened . All and everything . The thought made his eyes swell . All that was natural and simple in life reduced him to tears . The dawn . . . Love . . . Libby . . . Only when he stepped off the train in New York , dragging his bag after him , did he understand his journey . He had left his wife . In the station he went into the coffee bar . It was nine o'clock in New York , eight in Chicago . Was she up ? Sleeping ? Dead ? He rejectedthe idea , not only that Libby might be dead ( wish fulfillment ? no , just the old business , just guilt ) but that he had left her . But the two seemed somehow to fit together : if he had not left her , then she could n't be anything but living and breathing . Christ , was he trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was being irrational . He took his change in dimes and went to the phone booth ; inside he sat fingering the coins . If he had n't left Libby , it must be that he really had come East to see his father , to soothe his mother . So he made up his mind and called Brooklyn . ( As he dialed he saw Libby stirring in their bed  --  yes , alive and breathing . ) He allowed the phone to ring ten times , then an eleventh , and then  --  breathless-a twelfth . Then he hung up  --  bang ! Twelve long rings because he was a dutiful man , a good son . Good son ? Dope ! Jerk ! Weakling ! Where 's your courage ? He remained seated in the phone booth and found some serenityin thinking that no one except Libby knew he was in New York . He might as well be anywhere . It was the first time in six years that he had been separated from his wife . This morning he had awakened  --  or met the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel , accidentally or on purpose , anybody 's hands , feet , or hair , without having to worry first thing in the morning about somebody else 's feelings . Five and a half years of it . Outside the booth , at nine A.M. , there was no one he knew ; nobody who passed paid him any attention . Every few minutes he heard announced the departure of another train for another part of the East . He had only to climb aboard and get off in Wilmington , Baltimore , or Miami Beach . Washington . . . get a little room somewhere , get a job in some government office , and disappear . Start making a life not on the basis of what he dreamed he was , or thought he was supposed to be , or what literature , philosophy , friends , enemies , wife , parents told him he must be , but siin ly in terms of his own possibilities . Picking up his suitcase ( the new life would be begun simply : one suit , one sport jacket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the booth . But in the midst of the crowds pushing toward the tracks , he seemed not to be gaining anonymity but losing it ; and so the only train he took that morning was the BMT , and where it carried him was back to the place where he had been born . There is no need to chronicle Paul Herz 's feelings as he left the subway and walked the three blocks to the Liverpool Arms . He was anybody returning home . It was June in Brooklyn , and he had lived seventeen Junes in Brooklyn before he had gone off to college and a wife . Nothing was unfamiliar to his eyes . The elevator smelled like the inside of a tin can , and the corridors smelled milky  --  no change there either . Upstairs the same door was hinged on their apartment ; under his feet was the same doormat . At the age of eleven Paul had cut a sliver from one of his father 's business cards with an old razor blade and Scotch-taped it above the doorbell : his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would give his saddened old man a little lift , for Mr. Herz had just gone under for the third time  --  real estate . That little sliver was still there above the bell , and considering what the sight of it did to Paul 's insides , he knew the apartment itself would be too much . She would make unfair claims . Paul , look at this photo  --  remember the picnics ? RememberUncle Nathan who died , such a young man and the only one on your father 's side with the benefits of a college education ? Paulie , Sheepshead Bay , look . You ate shrimps till they came out of your ears , you and Maury , remember ? And your stamps , no one has touched a single page , and your rocks and your butterflies and your baseball glove and your report cards , still framed  --  oh Paul , how could you do this to your parents , a boy who got such perfect grades in ConductHe rang the bell for two reasons . First , if it was not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it was for something else , and he did not want to think about that right now . ( Though he could not help himself really : if he had actually left Libby , then she must be dead . Ridiculous . She was awake now in Chicago  --  then he had not left her . This was ridiculous reasoning ! ) Secondly , he rang because , having telephoned earlier , he was pretty sure no one was home . He rang again and again . Then there was only one more thing to do . He turned the door handle ; to his relief he found that it was locked . He began to breathe again . Imagine having to sit in that club chair in the living room , one hand on either doily , waiting for his mother to come home . So what now ? Where ? Suitcase in hand , he moved past all the empty milk and sour-cream bottles top414the elevator . Where ? Anywhere . Start again . Last chance . Once there 's a baby it 's all over . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father too  --  well , that would be that . If it had taken five and a half years to walk out on his Libby , it would take forever with some little Nahum sleeping in the other room . He got in the elevator and traveled down to the main floor . His body actually shook at the thought that if he wanted to he need no longer have any connection to anybody . Consequently he did not even leave the elevator but pushed the button marked 6 and rose once again . " My God  --  Paul ! " Doris had on a gay floral apron over her slacks . Inside , instead of old lady Horvitz 's oriental rugs , there was blue carpeting as far as the eye could see ; instead of the meaty odor that used to waft out from the kitchen when Maury 's parents were fattening their son up in this same apartment , there now floated out the pungent , domesticsmell of coffee . Things had changed  --  everything but Doris , who seemed as stunned at seeing him as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bones his first discoverieswere made . Paul had had Doris ; Doris , Paul . Yes , all the inconsequentiality and fervor of their passion came back to him . . . Doris still slouched in the shoulders and he had the old impulse to tell her to straighten up and be beautiful . But she was Maury 's wife now , ten years older , and the mistress of all that carpeting . " Hello , Doris . I wondered  --  I was looking for my mother . " " Oh Paul . She 's at the hospital . Maury just drove her over a few minutes ago . Paul , it 's you . " " I called downstairs and she was n't home . " " She 's been living here since it happened . " Ah , it . Not the heart attack . Never the plane crash or the cancer or the bankruptcy . The it . The tsura one could n't even mention . He was home . He looked at Doris 's familiar face , and suddenly he remembereddistinctly her father 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the two of them had sat panting : " Doris , is that you , dolly ? Is somebody with you ? Tell him thank you , dolly , and tell him it 's the next day already , your father has to get up and go to work soon , tell him thank you and good night , dolly  --  " " How is he ? " Paul asked , and waited to hear that it had killed his own father , that the old man 's last failure was history . " I guess , " said Doris , shrugging , " I guess he 's coming along.  |p415What  can we expect ? He 's in a terrific coma . You got Maurie 's telegram ? " He stood in the old hallway ( waiting for Maury to finish his malted milk , waiting for Maury to finish his clarinet lesson ) and was aware that somebody now knew he was in New York . All his circumstances , past and present , settled down over him . He saw Libby in the bathroom in Chicago squeezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , and followed Doris into the apartment . " I can only stay a minute , " he added . " Just a cup of coffee . Just sit down . Paul , " she said , " it 's good to see you . " They came into the living room , which was nothing like the old days when every object had its coverlet , the sofa its antimacassars , the piano its Spanish shawl , the satin lamp shades their little plastic dustproof wrappings . The room now was airy and modern , all pastel shades ; with no heavy drapings falling across the windows , light blazed into every corner . Avocados and gardenias flourished as though they were outdoors . There was a playpen near the window , toys all around , and in conspicuous places photographs of Maury , Doris , and a baby . " You have a child ? " Paul asked . " Two . Jeff is in nursery school . Michael 's in his crib having his bottle . Two boys  --  " Before she could ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bottle , he said , " I better not stay too long , Doris . " " You look so tired . " " Traveling . " He remained standing . " How 's Maury ? " " He 's doing wonderful  --  and he talks about you , Paul . He really does . We have whole conversations about you . " The tinge that rose on her neck and cheeks revealed a little of the nature and spirit of those conversations . " Why do n't you put down your luggage ? " she suggested . " You 're looking fine , Doris , too  --  " " Do I look the same ? " " Except for your hair . You wear that differently . " " Sure , well , I cut it . Not just me , everybody 's wearing it short . Sit down , all right ? Put down your suitcase , you make me tired standing there holding it . You like espresso ? We even drink it for breakfast . You ought to see your mother drowning it with cream and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p416He  decided  --  her silly talkativeness decided for him  --  to stay for a little coffee . " Either is all right . " " Sit down . " He released his suitcase with an unconscious sigh , and they smiled at one another . " Oh Paul , " she called from the kitchen , " it 's so wonda-ful to see you. , , Could it be ? He had taken off his coat and had sat down in a chair with beautiful wooden arms ; he stretched out his legs . Oh , it felt good . He even closed his eyes , even had a pure moment of thoughtlessness  --  his mind ceased searching out the next five minutes . Was it possible that he was happy ? Had his crisis passed ? Without even knowingit , had he come to some decision ? Or was it only Doris and the sweet familiarity of her vowels and diphthongs ? Wonda-ful , mahvelous , you could caay faaaw me  --  she was humming in the kitchen . What a good-natured girl . What a pliable simple girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night  --  Wonda-ful . . . So was Elizabeth DeWitt Herz pliable . So was Libby simple  --  oh yes , simple ! And there went his happiness and his thoughtless moment . He sat straight up , taking in the facts of Maury 's prosperity and success . Actually it did n't seem to have been happiness he had been experiencing ' anyway  --  just relief at Doris 's not hating him . As if what Doris Horvitz did or did not feel made any significant difference in his life . He looked at his watch . Ten-fifteen . She is having breakfast alone . Is n't she better off ? He wanted to shout right through to where he saw her sitting bent over the table , in that blue flannel bathrobe with the white piping , buttering her toast . And  --  oh , no , no , not crying ? Libby , baby , what are you crying over now ? Oh dumbbell , look , get up , get dressed , put on that new yellow jumper and get out . Take a nice long walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's spring , Libby , take a train to the Loop , have lunch , go to Stouffer 's with all the ladies , go to Field 's , shop , live . Libby , you 're alone , you see , without worries , without cares  --  see how wonda-ful it can be ? Free , Libby ! Free , young , still pretty , and in Field 's ten nun will smile at that face of yours  --  maybe , who knows , Wallach himself No . In Marshall Field 's she will have eyes for baby clothes and bassinets . She will bring home with her ( written in her little spiral pad purchased for just this purpose ) a list of what they will have to buy ( page one ) ; what they might have to buy ( page two ) ; and ( pages three and four ) what it would be oh so nice to have , Paul , ifp417and when we can afford it . One short month , darling , and we 'll have our little Nahum . Our comfort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the couch ; Paul noticed that she had applied lipstick and eye shadow in the kitchen . The tray settled , Doris reached behind her and lowered the pulley lamp that extended from the wall . She tugged at it without even looking , and the carelessness , the at-homeness , of her movementhad its effect upon him . It led him to believe that she was very happy . She was wearing little black sequined house slippers and they too somehow encouraged him to believe that she was happy . " Do you like French crescents ? " she asked . " You get them ready-made and you just warm them . In the oven , and that 's it . " " They look very good . " " Maury likes anything European . " " Maury was always a bon vivant , " he mumbled . " Are you being sarcastic ? " she asked . " Cause you were always sarcastic , Paul . I mean you could always cut somebody if you made up your mind to . The intellectual , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's very nice of you , Doris . Except I 've lost half my hair . " " Oh , " she said kindly , " not half . " Yes , the same cuddly Doris . All right , dolly , let the young man open the door for himself and let us hear his footsteps lightly down the hallway , what do you say , young man " I 'll bet Maury 's got every strand . " " Maury "  --  she knocked on wood ; that is , she looked for wood and found formica  --  " Maury always had a nice head of hair . With him it 's in the family . " She flushed again ; even while she spoke , Mr. Herz lay in the hospital , a bald spot the size of a half dollar at the back of his skull . " You 'd recognize him right off , Paul . You really would . Paul "  --  she turned serious all at once  --  " you know Heshy Lerner got killed in Korea . You know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's hard to imagine , is n't it ? He was such a good dancer , remember ? And he was always , you know  --  you remember the type of fella Heshy was . He was very much the life of the party . " " He was a very funny guy . " " Look , " she said , as though he had just disparaged himself , " so were you . You could really make very funny comments , Paul , when you wanted to . Paul , you were a very popular fella , and then you went away . For that matter , " she rushed to say , " everybody 's movingp418away and it 's just not the same . If you do n't live in the suburbs today , you do n't live anywhere . Maury and I believe , however , in being individualists . " " How 's my mother , Doris ? " She closed her eyes to answer . " She had to get a shot to calm her , that 's how your mother is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humbling effect upon the prodigal son . " Now it 's a little better , but not much . " " When did it happen ? " It ! " His heart attack , " he added . " What 's today , Saturday ? Tuesday night . We were at the show and when we got back there was an ambulance and a whole crowd , and they were carrying him out on a stretcher . Maury went in the ambulance with him , and then he came back , I think it was three in the morning , maybe later , and we put your mother to sleep in Jeffrey 's room , and we talked whether we should send you the telegram , and we sent it . I guess you got it , when  --  yesterday ? " " I got it Wednesday morning . Three days ago . " Apparently she had been expecting him to lie , or wanting him to . All she could finally do was pour coffee into his cup , from which he had as yet taken only a small sip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , Doris ? " " Look , I do n't think so . . . " It was as though she wanted , by minimizing the crisis , to excuse Paul 's not running to his father 's bedside . " What do the doctors say ? " " They do n't know . " " He 's in a coma ? " " Since Tuesday night . " " Did he have any attacks before , recently ? " " Well , he always had heart trouble ; he was never a well man , Paul , let 's not kid ourselves . " " He never had heart trouble . " " He certainly did have heart trouble , I beg your pardon . " " He thought he had heart trouble , Doris . " " What do you call what he had then , a belly-ache ? " " I do n't know . " She jumped up from the couch and began picking up toys from around the room and throwing them into the playpen . " You do n't have to hate him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hospital ! " " I do n't hate him . " And those few words seemed to render him helpless.  |p419Doris  apparently sensed his condition , for she rose on her toes now when she spoke . " If a man had a heart attack , and three of the biggest heart men say he had a heart attack , then I do n't see how you can get here about a week later and say he did n't have one . " " I was talking about six years ago , Doris , seven , eight years back . " " You can have premonitions , ca n't you ? You can have terrible troubles , believe me , that can bring things on . " " I suppose you can . I suppose you can sit around having premonitionsall your life . " " You always had to believe different from everybody else . The whole world is wrong and you 're right ! " It was the proper moment to get up and go . But the colorful airy apartment , Doris 's bad posture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pulley lamp , the French crescents that you warm and serve  --  all of them together took most of the starch out of their argument . Even Doris 's chastisements did n't seem original . The simple truth was  --  and it was a simple truth both must have understood , for both calmed down at the same speed  --  that some nice affection still lived between these two old playmates . What did any of this have to do with all that heavy breathing back when they were seventeen ? On this day particularly , he was not anxious to dismiss whatever little kindnesses came his way . Doris must have had a soft spot for kindness , for remembered affection , herself . She asked , " Another crescent ? " They ate and drank , and then they heard the baby turn in his crib and the bottle clunk onto the floor . Doris put her finger to her mouth and they were both absolutely quiet ; when the crisis was over , she smiled in a motherly way . " You 're still teaching ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's right . " " Well , you used to read all the time , so I guess we should have guessed then . . . Oh it 's really funny , Paul , talking to you . It gives me the gooseflesh . Eleven o'clock in the morning , I 'm dusting my house , and I 'm married , and I 've just given my little boy his bottle , and my husband 's just left , and I 'm trying to think of shopping and a thousand things , and in walks Paul Herz . I 'm sorry if I 'm babbling , but that 's what happens to me . Maury and I were down in Miami in January and who should we run into on Lincoln Road , just window/shopping , but Peanuts Ackerman , from Ocean Avenue , who I used to go out with for a couple months in high school . And I 'm telling you , he 's married , and he has this wife with him , a really terrific blonde  --  and three kids , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling whenever I see a guy I used to date , and now I 'm married and he 's married , and we got furniture and cars and kids . I just get this feeling  --  " Paul said , " I get it too . " " Are you being sarcastic again ? " He shook his head . He was no longer the sharp-tongued backseatDon Juan . Hardly . He slumped a little in his chair , for he felt there was something in this room that he had expected for himself . Never  --  not in Detroit , Chicago , Ann Arbor , Iowa City , not even in Brooklyn as a boy  --  had he felt very permanent about himself . And that was sad and ironic , for he had married early for reasons that were not really so out of the ordinary . " I get it seeing you , Paul , " Doris was telling him . " I got it seeing Peanuts and those kids , and his wife , such a terrific-looking girl . And what makes it something is that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even have married the other person . I do n't mean that kind of accident  --  I mean some quirk , anything . You think that 's dumb , do n't you ? " " No  --  I 'm just not sure about the last part . " He was n't very sure about any of it , but he was not unwilling to let the girl go on and on ; it was nice having a little respite from life . He had married at twenty as though to bully his way into manhood ; now a little vacation from manhood was a pleasure . Everybody deserves a few minutes off now and then anyway . One deep breath , then off to the hospital ... " What last part ? " Doris asked . He had to think . " Marrying people by accident . " " Paul , if you want to say that you could n't have married me because I 'm not smaaht enough , look , go right ahead . I 'll admit I do n't read every book that comes out , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what you think , you 're perfectly justified . " " You want to fight with me , Doris ? " " You 're the one who 's fighting . " " All I meant was that there probably is some real chemistry between two people who decide to marry . " " Boy , you read too many novels , " she said . " It 's not all sex . " " All right . " If he could only think of a place to go , he wouldp421leave . Suddenly she filled him with the same weariness and boredom that she had in 1948 . What was the name of the hospital ? Where would he leave his suitcase ? Where would he sleep ? Why , downstairs , in his old bed , where else ? " Well , that 's what you meant , " she said . " I only meant some necessary connection . Some serious service one does for the other . " " How  --  " she asked , pouring him another cup of coffee . " How , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of me and Maur ? " " I do n't know you and Maury . " " You remember us . " " Hell , Doris "  --  his irritation was less with the conversation than with his own willingness to stay for yet another cup  --  " we 've all changed . " " Well , so have you ! " " That 's what I meant . " " You were a very excitable guy then , and now , I do n't know , I just do n't think you look so excitable any more . I suppose you matured . " " I struck you , did I , as young ? " " Well , you think it 's a joke and that I 'm stupid , but as a matter of fact , if you want to know the truth , at twenty Maury was much more of a man , I thought , than you . A much more settled fella , with real goals . " " Well , " Paul said , raising his hands , " he seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicely , thank you . I ca n't make out if you 're sarcastic or not . " " Not ! Come on , Doris , ten years have gone by , what 's this sarcastic business ! " " Well , I 'm not ashamed of how Maury 's doing . He may not be a "  --  at the last second she seemed to swap one word for another  --  " Rockefeller , but he 's a very good husband to a girl . He makes a girl very happy . It 's very nice , believe me , to have somebody who 's very proud of you . I know plenty of girls whose husbands never really admire them dressed up , or do n't take pride in the way their wives fix their hair or in their wives ' taste  --  which is very important to a woman  --  and I 'm not one of them . " " You look very happy . " " Well , you do too ! "  | " I did n't accuse you of anything , Doris . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you must love your wife very much to have given up everything for her . " Having stayed this long , having chosen to be unrealistic and indulgent , he should have expected it . " What did I give up ? " he asked . " I 'm not criticizing . " " I only wanted to know what you thought I had to give up . " " I only meant to say that you must love your wife very much . " He had no choice . " I do , " he said . " Well . . . then . . . " But she could n't lay off , this girl whom he had caressed and caressed . " That must make it all worth it . " " It does , " he heard himself saying . " I suppose she 's an intellectual too . " " Look , Doris , it 's hard to tell what you have in your mind when you say intellectual . ' " " Like you . " " Well , she is like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's quite serious . That 's right . " " Well , maybe she is . " " What does that mean ? She is . She 's a serious girl . She 's a very valuable person . " " Well , " Doris said , " it 's up to the individual . Personally I just do n't think you happen to have liked Jewish girls . I do n't think you respected them , to be frank , if you want the truth . " " My wife is Jewish . " " I meant , " said Doris , not flinching , " by birth . " " I do n't think that has much to do with it . " Get up ! Go ! Why punish yourself ! " You might not think so , " Doris said , " but a lot of it is in your subconscious . It 's a reaction . It happens to a lot of Jewish guys . Especially smart ones . " After a second , she added , " The ones who think they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " that people choose mates for other reasons . " She did n't seem to believe it ; she closed her eyes once again . " Complicated reasons , " he said . " That 's complicated to me , all right . You take a fella , a normal fella , and you expect he 's going to first off be attracted to a girl of his own particular faith , right ? Then he turns around and doesp423the opposite . You could n't want anything more complicated if you wrote away for it . " " As a matter of fact , you could . " Defiantly , as though she had him chained to his chair , she asked , " For instance ? " " Oh , for instance why did you marry Maury ? " " Well , " she said , losing breath and coloring , " he 's Jewish at least . " " Never mind , Doris . Let 's forget all this . " " Why did you marry her ? " Doris demanded . " I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " Love . " After he had spoken he experienced a terrible moment of confusion . But he said again , " Love . " " So then why do n't you have any children ? " The question startled him further . " We do n't want any chil-dren . " " I do n't believe it , a Jewish fella . " " You 've got too much faith , Doris , in us poor Jewish fellas . " " You 're not the same fella , Paul , that 's the truth . If a man and his wife have a solid relationship then they have children . " He did not wish to tell anybody in Brooklyn of Libby 's kidney trouble ; besides it did not seem to him that this was actually why they had no children . " Doris , that may not be so in all cases . Is n't that a possibility ? " " Listen , you make love to a girl different , if you want to know , when there are children involved . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just not the same fella , and that 's all I 'm trying to say . " At last he pulled his weakened self up out of his chair . He felt he had heard just about everything that had been thought and said about him in the last five years . He set down his cup . " You were always a lively , affectionate fella , Paul , and you know it . You were the kind of fella who you could just see someday playing with his own kids , tossing them up in the air and taking them to Ebbets Field and the whole works . You were a very affectionatefella , Paul . " " Well , " he said , unable to remember where he had put his suitcase , and growing more furious by the moment , " maybe it turns out I 'm a cold fish . Maybe that 's my story . " But Doris was shaking her head . " You were always kissing me , Paul , " she said . " That 's something that if you do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very affectionate person , I can tell you that . Maury says I 'm sometimes too demonstrative even . " Where was the suitcase ? " Doris , you do n't know what you 're talking about . " " And you , " she said , heartbroken , her hands on her hips , " you were the smartest of any of us . " It was time to go . Go , you coward . Your suitcase is right at your feet . Go . Where ? " Where are you going  --  where ? " she called after him as he started down the hall . " Paul ? " she called , but he had no answer . As he opened the door to the elevator she shouted to him " Paul , you 're a fool . Oh Paul , you ruined your life ! " It was only another voice in the chorus . At home , whenever eggs were served for breakfast , he served them . It was not that Libby could n't crack an egg properly , or even that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had worked out their life together , he usually slipped from his side of the bed in the morning while she was asleep  --  at any rate , while her eyes were closed . Only occasionally , out of exhaustion or a lingering sense of the fitness of things , they lay side by side in bed , wide awake ; and then he was compelled  --  still out of a lingering sense of the fitness of things , of what was only just and right  --  to make the ultimate expression of that connection which husbands and wives are said to have , and which he and his wife no longer had  --  perhaps never had  --  and which therefore made the expression of it a hypocrisybeyond any hypocrisy he could ever have imagined . It was not very pleasant to start the day caught somewhere between the betrayal of your marriage  --  the very convention of marriage itself  --  and the betrayal of your own flesh . Nor to end it that way ; as a result they did not often go to bed at the same hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plop , the sizzle , all brought back to him ( as though they ever left him ) the realities of his home life . From the far end of the room , Asher called , " Up  --  over ? Which ? " No longer was the El outside Asher 's window , and the sun , allowedaccess , cast a glow on the stiff curved leaves of the pottedp425plants that circled the room . The floors , walls , and furniture , however , had n't gained much from the alteration in the city 's landscape . As for Asher , El or no El , light or half-light , he looked the same ; nose , pores , hair , belly , aroma , everything was just six years older . " How is that weather in Chicago ? " he called . " Now it 's spring , " Paul answered . " Hot , huh ? " " Yes , hot . " " There 's a city that 's got a climate for you . Takes all that crap from Canada , all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My hair dropped out of my head there , Paulie , from humidity alone . " " I forget you were a Chicagoan . " " All that clamminess and police corruption , " Asher called from the kitchen , " produces baldness early . Either you 're perspiring into your hatband or worrying to death . " He was crossing the room , the pan in one hand , the other hand drawing a bead on his nephew 's hairline . " Ah , but you 're not doing so bad yet yourself . In fact , you look nice , Paul . You got a nice grave expression in your face . Second violinist for the Krakow Philharmonic . " He slid the egg onto the plate Paul held out to him , then sat down , the pan dangling from his hand . Paul was feeling now the kind of relief he had felt at first at Doris 's . He was willing to accept the fact that he had made one false start this morning already . Now he understood things better ; on the subway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of his trip . " Thanks , " he said to Asher . Asher smiled ; even he was a help . He had opened the door , shaken hands , and when Paul asked if there was a bed he might use for a night or two , Asher had pointed over to the sofa , no questions asked  --  at least not right then . " You look in the eyes , " Asher said , " like you 've been having some of life 's more classical experiences . " Having brought a bite of egg to his mouth , Paul set it down ; he waited out the nausea that reached up from his stomach . " I did n't get much sleep on the train , " he said . " Oh , sure , well "  --  Asher moved out of his chair and pulled up on the high stool beside his drawing board  --  " that explains every-thing . " " But you 're the same , Asher , " said Paul wryly , and tried once again to eat . He told himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neutral bed in which to sleep ; he could proceed as planned.  | " Oh I manage to maintain a nice lofty attitude , " said Asher . " You 've seen my father ? " Those wrinkled lids of Asher 's , magnified behind his glasses , came down over his eyes , telling all . " From the hallway . " " And my mother ? " " You want me to give you a little chronicle of hysteria , or you want to go on past performances ? " " She mentions me ? " " Paul , there 's nothing she wo n't mention . She 's a dredger of polluted waters . She was never too sharp at sorting out forests from trees . " But he might as well hear it all ; that too could give strength . " What does she say about me ? " " I thought you had an imaginative spirit . " He took another mouthful , and saw no reason not to confide in his uncle , not when the man wanted to be helpful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't do it . It does n't make sense , given my life . I came all the way here to New York because . . . I do n't know precisely . " That much he could keep to himself . " I went over to Brooklynthis morning . " " I figured . " " It cost me a round trip from Chicago that I ca n't even afford . Asher , I ask you , do I owe them anything ? " Asher was n't even willing to take the question seriously . " Nobodyowes nobody nothing . " " Not when they ate my guts out , " Paul said , and found appetite for his breakfast . Asher was tapping his forehead with his fingers . " You think too much in conditions . Same old story , you miss the point . " " And I 'm leaving my wife , " said Paul , because he had to finally , because that was the corollary : He would not see his father . He would leave Libby . Though two sentences were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one act , arising out of some new direction of the will . He was moving instinctively toward an unburdening . Even deciding  --  instinctively again  --  to come to Asher 's seemed somehow a part of it . " It 's beyond choice , " he said , and felt better than at any moment in the last twenty-four hours . Asher blinked several times , as though watching Paul 's words fall into the proper slots . " No kidding , " he said . Nausea reached up a quick hand for the freshly ingested egg . Paul swallowed . " That 's what it looks like , " he said.  | " She sleeps around ? " Asher asked . " She does n't keep the place straightened up nice ? " " You 're just the same , Asher . " " You went away a few years , you think everybody went all over the place taking courses in tact , awaiting your homecoming ? " " Well , I 'm not after sympathy , Asher . So never mind . I just ran into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's leave it at that . " " But the girl is still ideal , huh ? " " I 'm getting out , Asher , but I 'm not kidding myself where the blame lies . I was young . Things came up . I made some terrible errors of judgment that threw a pall on the thing . I did n't know a hell of a lot . And then there 's the matter of one 's constitution . I mean what you are ; the facts about oneself . " " I do n't like to tell a man over his breakfast coffee , Paul , but it 's your whole philosophy that stinks bad . " " Please do me a favor , do n't feel you have to spend time cheeringme up . I 've arrived at my decision and I 'll take the consequence . This is the consequence , " he said , with a slight sense of discovery . " It has n't been very pleasant , believe me it has n't . " Asher was no longer giving him all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was walking toward the kitchen , a frazzled outlinein the sunlight . His hair needed cutting , his trousers a good pressing . " Love , " he said over his shoulder , " is unnatural . Most of the guilt in the world is from cockeyed thinking . " Ile disappeared around the flowered screen that cut oil the sink from Paul 's sight . " Asher , we see life as two different things . As I remember "  --  and he did , which compromised his position , and smothered him in gloom  --  " we went over this ground a long time ago . We disagree . " " Paulie , " came back a voice , " I 'm going to save you a couple thousand dollars and give you a fast college education , plus a psychoanalysisthrown in .

" You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do ? " Asher asked . " You do n't listen . " Paul rose from the couch , which was to have been his bed . What was there left for him to do but sweat it out in some cheap hotel ? But in some cheap hotel , under a bare bulb , would he survive ? Better to take all the money they had left in the bank , the money they would no longer be needing for a baby , and go uptown and get ap428nice room that looked out on Central Park . A little class , a little comfort , might get him through . However , one does not learn to spend money overnight . . . And suppose Libby should want the baby anyway ? He sat down again , as though he had only been taking a stretch to aid digestion . " Is that a condition of staying here ? " he asked with a smile on his face . " Paying attention ? " " Kiddo , " said Asher , " no conditions . That 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . I 'm at one with life . Only guy I know . " Paul could n't understand his uncle now any better than he had years ago . " And that little girl you had here , years and years ago  --  " Asher looked up from across the room where he was watering his plants . Was n't there water shining in his eyes as well ? " My little Patricia Ann ? " " She made you happy ? That 's an example of oneness with life ? Please , Asher , let 's not make light of each other 's problems . " " All you , you do n't understand loss . " " I thought you 've been telling me you 're happy ? " " Putz , I 'm miserable . What kind of issue is that ? I thought we 're going to have a little talk about first principles . " His suitcase was n't far from the door . Right downstairs , Third Avenue was lined with hotels  --  but none of them , he knew , would be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you deserve it . . . However , on that last point there must have been some inner debate ; immediately he was back to thinking of himself holed up in some sleazy hotel . It seemed appropriate , yet he knew he did n't have the strength . He could get through , though , with just an ounce of companionship , someone to take a meal with and sit next to in a movie . Then , free ! " Maybe later , Asher . " Asher was unhooking his sports jacket from the back of the door . " Paul , I got a new girl friend who is right up your alley . A very nifty little number with a nice pair of sloe-eyes  --  Washington Park is stocked with them  --  but gradually I 'm draining out of her head all the cotton candy . See , this is a new thing for me . I do n't go in for education . I prefer the thing in the pure state .

I want to feel the precise quality of the shit against my skin . Do you get the picture ? Your Uncle Asher is the child of the age . Ecce Asher ! " His tie in place , he raised his arms . Behold ! His shirt inched up out of hisp429trousers . Realizing he was beltless , he went off toward the kitchen . He likes being a slob , he prefers life outside the ordered world , Paul thought . One more attitude he did not share with his uncle . When he was sloppy it was because his mind was elsewhere . Then what did the two of them share ? It was Asher he had chosen to seek out , after all ; he had not even thought of Uncle Jerry and his big air-conditioned apartment .

She has never really communicated with another human being . I ask her , whatsa matter , you never lift up the phone when it rings ? But she does n't get the truth in what I 'm saying .

I want you to meet this girl , Paulie , she 's got a very involved case of what you got , only you 're smarter . " " I never worry about The Bomb , Asher . " " I 'm talking about the disgusting load you 're placing on the heart . Overworked . Misunderstood . Terrible . " He was fully dressed now , standing over Paul . " I take it , Asher , that you 're in favor of emotional anarchy , separation , a withdrawal of people from people . A kind of moral isolationism . " " Very inventive , " said Asher . " But what I 'm in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this emphasis on charity and fucking . Disgusting . " " But you 've always had women , Asher . You told me that too , remember ? A Chinese woman and so on . That 's all you talked about last time we met . You made it sound as though I was leaving a harem for marriage . Let 's be serious , if we 're going to have discussions .

That 's **28;3418;TOOLONG Lutz was saying that a short turn around the deck might be very pleasant in the morning air  --  would he join them ? He glanced back at Amparo like a man expecting the worst . She , with elbows on table , managed an impressive display of pantomime at high speed : pity for him or perhaps his stupidity , contempt for the Lutzes , warning , insult , false commiseration , and finally , just simple ridicule . He turned away and lunged forward . The big plain girl at his side hung her head with her eyes so cast down she seemed to be asleep . The gay little procession advanced , but after one lap around Herr Lutz moved up abreast of Herr Hansen , and Frau Lutz walked with her daughter , it being quite clear that the young people were not making any headway in conversation . Herr Lutz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humor , stuck pretty consistently to the practical considerations of life , always led off his first talk with any stranger by inquiring how he got his living . The more unpretentious and immediate the means proved to be , the sooner the stranger established himself in Herr Lutz 's esteem . He learned with delight that Herr Hansen had been in the dairy business in Mexico . " Ah ha , " he exclaimed , " we go well together . I deal in bread , you in butter . I ran an inn near Lake Chapala , but you see , we have thought better of that . And how did you find the dairy business , in Mexico ? " " I found it so poor , " said Hansen , " I sold out and am going back to Sweden . However , I made enough on the deal to start again at home , and there at least I shall know the tricks and know how to look out for them . In Mexico , they change the rules every day . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lutz , expansive as if he were bringing a pleasant piece of news . " The big fish eat the little ones , and the little ones eat seaweed , maybe . " ' Well do I know that , " said Herr Hansen , joining Herr Lutz in a moderate laugh . " I tell you what , " said Herr Lutz , warmed by the young man 's wonderfulsense of humor , " let 's all have one more little cup of coffee in the bar . Or maybe Elsa would like a glass of beer , eh ? " he said slyly teasing . Frau Lutz frowned , Elsa turned dark red under her powder , and Hansen said quickly , " No , please let me invite you . " There followed a sociable little contest all the way to the table , but finally it was as Herr Hansen 's guests that the Lutzes sat down to the morning beer.  | " You being Danish , " said Herr Lutz affably , after the first fine swig , " naturally you would be in the dairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herr Hansen , patiently weary of this lifelong dullness on the part of foreigners who could not tell a Dane from a Swede or a Norwegian from either . " There is a slight difference . " " So ? Well , myself being Swiss , naturally I am in the hotel business . From my great-grandfather to me , we had the same hotel in St. Gallen . But I was restless , a good living was not good enough for me , I must go and run a hotel somewhere else besides Switzerland . Switzerland , for me , was too peaceful . Ah , beautiful , picturesque , peaceful Switzerland , as the travel books say . That 's true enough . But almost every week I got in the mail guidebooks and pamphlets from Mexico inviting solid businesslike foreigners to come to Mexico , invest their money and make their fortune . " " So did I , " said Hansen . " Some of it was true . " " Not enough of it , though , " said Herr Lutz . " Not a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about beautiful scenery , beautiful weather , beautiful tourists with pockets bursting with beautifulmoney . Now then , " he asked in some surprise , " would n't you think that I , a man weaned on those very things , would have said to myself , Why , we have all that here already . But only one thing wrong : there are many tourists in Switzerland , but also there are many , many too many hotels . The tourist trade did not always go around . We had dead seasons . There came those times when we were all prepared to hand out lavish hospitality and almost nobody came . In Mexico , the pamphletssaid  --  serious , official , from the proper departments of government  --  all was better . No seasons , the suckers just poured in the year round . Cheap food , cheap labor , cheap rent , cheap taxes , cheap everythingexcept the tourists . They were nearly all North Americans and you could charge them just what they were used to paying at home or even more . You could give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Of course the pamphlets did not say this in so many coarse words , but I , a good hotelkeeper , could read between the lines . Even now , it sounds like Paradise on earth  --  well , we all know there is no such place . In Switzerland it was the Germans and the Britishand the French and the Spanish and the Central European Jews and oh , my God , in the old days the Russians who drove us to our graves . Also the political refugees from everywhere who arrived looking rich without a franc in pocket who were always expecting tomorrowp102huge sums of money . . . So , we started out , my wife and I with this Elsa here , who was a lump of a thing this high , in 1920  --  " Elsa fidgeted and clutched her beer glass . Hansen glanced at her briefly as if she were an inanimate object of no interest whatever , and away . Her mother tried anxiously to catch her father 's eye , but failed . Herr Lutz was wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We told our families we were coming back millionaires , and they believed us . We promised to send back money in the meantime and make everybody rich . Truth is we never sent a centime . We were a year getting started , with finding a suitable place , arranging things with the government , bribing here and there , struggling with native labor  --  too long to tell , and you know all of it , anyway . But we did get a presentablelittle inn going , and yes , it was true , the tourists did come and they did pay well for everything . In 1920 there was revolution . Likewise in 1921 , 1922 ; then counterrevolution in 1923 and ' 24 : and so , revolution again , and so on , until now . At last we decided to go back to peaceful Switzerland . So you see ? Well , maybe we can talk a little business . Send me tourists from your country and I will buy a few pounds of your best butter . We have butter too  --  we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hansen then talked a little , obligingly , in turn , about the exportbusiness in butter and cheese , also eggs and bacon , strictly and minutely from the standpoint of the hazards and profits to be expected from it . Elsa , discouraged , was sure that Hansen did not talk about the butter business to Amparo . Well , it was a good thing he really did look crossgrained and hard to get along with . And he was as tiresome to listen to as her father . She was glad she did not like him , never had ; she did not want him to like her , either , yet she was deeply wounded by his neglect , which seemed as if he meant to insult her . He was too old , anyway  --  at least twenty-eight . She drew a deep weary breath and straightened up and turned her eyes away to the morning light on the glittering , dancing sea . Quietly she worked up in her mind a sound grudge against him , his poor manners , his awkward long legs and huge feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of man altogether . Surely now her mother would be able to see that Herr Hansen , even without Amparo , would never be the right one . Not even just to dance with on a ship . No , she would never dance with him even if he asked her . But of course he never would . . .  |p103There  was a tall thin black-haired young student , with a dangerous eye as if he feared nothing and nobody on earth , who went leaping madly around the deck at the head of the line , shouting mysterious Spanish phrases  --  some kind of slang she could not make out . Once he had looked at her and leaned out towards her as they passed , smiling on one side of his face as if they had a secret together . His glance had shot like arrows into her eyes and he had gone on leaping and singing . That was the one for her . She leaned her face on the palm of her hand , hiding from the others , fearing that the warmth and sweetness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Elsa , " asked her mother , anxiously , " what is the matter ? Do you feel badly ? " " No , no , Mama , thank you , " said Elsa , without taking her hands from her face , " the light is blinding . " That very student , as if Elsa had conjured him up , appeared in the bar ; he was not leaping or shouting , but walking lazily with two others of his crowd . He was talking , though , and his voice carried to her buzzingears . " La Cuaaracha Mystica , " he was saying , with a flourish of theatrical inflections , " the mystical cockroach herself , the queen of insects , is on board this ship , the very figure of rampant idealism . I saw her . She is here , pearls and all , a prisoner . " " La cucaracha , la cucaracha , " chorused the others , as instinctively malicious as monkeys . They were halfway through the first verse , leaning towards each other and making dreadful harmonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With famine-stricken comic faces they turned as one and charged towards the dining room . As by then everyone on shipboard lived for food , there was the usual crowd milling at the top of the stairs , thinning out gradually into a procession . At lunch , the Captain was seated at the head of his table , his napkin tucked into his collar and spread neatly over his rigid chest . Dr. Schumann , seated at the opposite side , was turning his water glass about absently . At sight of the ladies of the party they both rose . The Captain withdrew his napkin , made a deep bow and seated himself once more , tucking the napkin back under his chin . Lizzi Spockenkieker , at his left , giggled and blushed , eying him with coy intimacy . " Dear Captain , we met this morning , I believe ! " she said , indiscreetly.  | " We did indeed , my dear Fraulein , " responded the Captain , with extreme formality . On his right , Frau Rittersdorf gave Lizzi a guarded look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming smile upon the Captain , who rewarded her with a glimpse of his two front teeth and slightly upturned mouth corners . The others ranged round him , faces bent towards him like sunflowers to the sun , waiting for him to begin conversation . " It is not usual for me to appear at table so early in the voyage , " stated the Captain , as if he were reading an address , " since all my energiesand attention must be devoted to the affairs of my ship . But I am happy to be able to say that in spite of a thousand difficulties and inconvenienceswhich added together amounted to a state of emergency , never have I been able so swiftly and so effectively to dispose of them all . On a ship " , no detail is trivial ; the slightest laxity at any given point may lead to the gravest consequences . For this reason , " he said , " usuallyI must deprive myself at intervals of the good company I enjoy at my table . But it is in the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told them , putting them forever in his debt . Little Frau Schmitt blushed at her own boldness but managed to utter in a tiny voice , " Even if it is for our own good , we are also de-prived . " Frau Rittersdorf was annoyed at this speech , which should have been made , certainly , but in much more elegant terms , with more manner , and not by Frau Schmitt , who by no means took precedence at that table . The Captain however seemed pleased . He bowed gently to Frau Schmitt . " You are very kind , " he said , approvingly . Herr Professor Hutten , without changing the conversation from its prime subject , the presence and authority of the Captain , shifted the emphasis from the feminine to the masculine domain by speaking in general terms of the importance of the science of navigation : " Of which , frankly I can do no less than admit , I know nothing , " with the manly generosity of one who knows himself to be an authority in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to observe how all science , as all art , is based firmly , immovably , upon mathematics . Withoutmathematics , where should we be for music , for architecture , for chemistry , for astronomy , above all for the scientific art of navigation , both on the sea and in the air ? One may safely set it down as a rule that the better the mathematician , the better the navigator , the better the composer of music . Do you , my dear Captain , from the point ofp105view of practical experience , find yourself in agreement with this rule ? " The Captain almost modestly admitted that his native aptitude for higher mathematics had been of great value to him as seaman . Professor Hutten went on to expand his ideas somewhat , from the purely philosophicalview , while the others , more especially the ladies , listened in respectful silence , all except Frau Rittersdorf having lost the thread of discourse some time ago . A slight but welcome interruption occurred when Wilhelm Freytag was heard again as usual to refuse the delicious Westphalia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ? " asked the waiter , " or perhaps liver pate ? " " Herring in sour cream , " said Herr Freytag , " I think . " " Oh , Herr Freytag , are you a vegetarian ? " asked Lizzi . " How interesting ! How can you give up all these delicious sausages and bacon for breakfast and this delicious ham . You must try it with a slice of melon sometime . It is divine ! " Freytag , helping himself to a fine mound of fresh peas , said rather flatly , " Oh , no , I never eat pork at all , " at which Frau Rittersdorf exchanged a lifted eyebrow first with the Captain , then with Frau Hutten , then with Herr Rieber , and her fleeting thought was returned to her in the quick gleam of their eyes from all three . Herr Rieber smiled broadly , wagged a finger at Freytag and remarked , " Aha ! Observing the dietary laws , I suppose . " At this improbable notion  --  or was it ?  --  everybody laughed heartily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a friendly joke . They then exchanged a few customary remarks about the Jews and their incomprehensible habits , a sort of small change of opinion which established them once for all as of the same kind of people without any irreconcilable differences ; and they settled down together comfortably prepared to change the topic ; but their attention was directed to a rather noticeable commotion at the students ' table . The boys rose from their chairs and bowed in the direction of the stairs , and one of them shouted " Viva ! " explosively . The woman who came in made them a formal little bow , very old-fashioned and learned in courtesy , then followed the steward to a small table where she sat alone with her back to the students . They sat down again exchanging odd malicious glances , elaborately wiping away smiles under their napkins . She was perhaps fifty years old and she had been a fine beauty notp106so long ago . Her face was smooth and wax-colored , her small round mouth was painted bright red , the small , clever-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smudges , her lightly tinted reddish hair was cut short and curled around her forehead and ears . She was slender except for a lazy little belly , and her clothes were very expensive-looking ; shabby as they were , they were still much too elegantfor her present occasions . She wore enormous pearls in her ears , around her throat , on two fingers of her left hand . On her right she wore what appeared to be a light-colored much-flawed emerald , big as a robin 's egg and surrounded by small diamonds . These hands , very narrow , fine , heavily veined , and old-looking , were in constant movement . Thumbs turned in lightly to the palm , the hands moved aimlesslyfrom the edge of the table to her lap , they clasped and unclasped themselves , spread themselves flat in the air , closed , shook slightly , went to her hair , to the bosom of her gown ' as if by a life of their own separate from the will of the woman herself , who sat quite still otherwise , features a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her plate . Everybody in the rgom turned to stare at her . " But where , " inquired Frau Rittersdorf of the Captain , " where does she come from ? No one saw her come on board , nor in the town before that , " she said , doubtfully , looking around the table , " at least , none of us . " " And no wonder , " said the Captain , importantly . " That lady  --  she is a Spanish condesa  --  was brought on board quietly , hours before the other passengers , by two police officers who attempted at once to escort her to the steerage , under the impression that I was going to put her in chains for the voyage , or at least confine her to a cabin . I could not treat a lady so , no matter what she had done , " said the Captain , and his eyes rested gently upon his passenger ; indeed , they feasted themselvesupon that personage , a real member of the nobility , a species seen all too rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to provide for her properly ; but fortunately , friends of hers reserved her stateroom by cable to Mexico , when it was learned that she would sail on this ship . " " Her hands ! " exclaimed Lizzi . " What is she doing with them ? " " She is in a highly wrought nervous state at the moment , " said Dr. Schumann . " Pardonable in her situation , perhaps . She will feel better shortly . " His tone and glance were dryly professional.  | " A little on the faded side , " said Herr Rieber , and instantly repented his tactlessness when seven pairs of eyes fastened upon him in rebuke . " She is not young , true , " said Dr. Schumann , " and her troubles are rather complicated  --  all completely unnecessary perhaps , but still . . . " " Would I not be a dupe , " asked the Captain , glancing sharply from face to face , " to take these Latin-American politicals seriously ? I was told she is a dangerous revolutionist , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sedition and rebellion to another , that she incites to riot  --  you would hardly believe all the nonsense . My own opinion is , she is one of these idle rich great ladies who like excitement , who get into mischief and make more mischief withoutin the least understanding what they do  --  this is always true of women in politics of any kind !  --  and she has got her fingers badly burnt . Well , " his voice softened , " this will teach her a lesson , it is not for us to add to her penalties . She is only going to Tenerife , in any case . That is not so bad , and in the meantime , I wish her a pleasant voyage . " " Those students who greeted her with such apparent respect , " said Herr Professor Hutten , thoughtfully , " resemble very little the revolutionarytype as I have learned to recognize it in Mexico . I should have said of these that they are the lamentably overindulged sons of wellto-doparents who have not taken their parental duties very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico , indeed , in all the Americas . One of our most constant problems , " he said , " was to protect our German youth from their influence in our schools . I am happy to say , relying as we did on the infallible combination of German character and German methods of discipline , we enjoyed a modest success . " " In Guadalajara also , " rejoined Frau Schmitt , " how often I have heard my dear husband deplore a state of affairs where our beautiful German children were exposed to the pernicious foreign customs . " " I had never imagined a revolutionist wearing such pearls , " said Frau Rittersdorf , who had been thinking her own thoughts . " If , indeed , they are real , which is doubtful . " " When such a lady wears pearls , " said little Frau Schmitt , respectfully , " I think we may be confident they are real . " " The students , " said the Captain to Herr Professor Hutten , heading off this dangerous feminine diversion of the topic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montpellier , since on account of the recent disturbances the University in Cuba has been closed over their heads.  |p108It  is all disorder of the most senseless kind , naturally , and should have been suppressed long ago without hesitation and with every necessary severity . As for revolutionists , they are a species of animal I am not acquainted with . I leave them gladly to those whose business it is to deal with them . " Leaning his head low over his plate , ducking up and down rhythmically , he began to gulp his dinner . The subject seemed closed , or suspended satisfactorily , on exactly the right note . Jenny , who felt refreshed and good-tempered after her nap , in spite of her disturbing dream , told David what she had learned about La Condesa , and was surprised at his look of lively admiration as he watched the lady , who had grown calmer and was peering nearsightedlyinto her salad . " Who told you all this ? " he asked , unwilling to believeanything Jenny said , however entertaining it might be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around deck , " said Jenny . a , " Is it a habit by now ? " asked David . " This is only the second time , " said Jenny . " I wish you 'd look at the zarzuela troupe . Ate n't they simply weird ? " For some reason she could not admit the human existence of the Spanish company . They seemed to be life-sized dolls moved by strings , going gracefully through a perpetualpantomime of graceless emotions . Their frowning faces , their gestures of anger , ill-humor , mockery , contempt , all seemed too farfetchedand overrehearsed to be probable ; she did not believe that any of it came out of living organisms . The Spaniards had hardly removed their several gazes from La Condesasince she appeared , and their eyes were charged with staring , bitterresentment . They nudged each other and whispered , their mouths sullen ; as they ate , or turned their heads , their eyes moved and maintainedtheir gaze . " If they 're planning to rob her , " said Jenny , " they will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pepe has n't been able to tear his eyes from her pearls once .

I never saw a real pearl close up . " " Darling , you make yourself sound as if you 'd had a pathetic childhood . Did you ? "  | " Yes , I damned well did . " ' Well , you might at least admit they are beautiful . " " I 'm not sure I think so , " said David , " I 'm so blinded with prejudice against people who can afford to buy pearls . They may be wonderful . I do n't care . " " It 's handsome of you to concede that much , " said Jenny . " Really handsome . " " I 'd perhaps like them better if I knew they were n't real , " said David , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Jenny , with sudden gaiety , " I know , that is just the kind of fellow you are  --  but would you like a sawdust woman instead of one with live insides ? It is really strange , " she said , " but I can love you and real pearls too  --  now how can that be ? " She smiled at him , he watched the smile change her face altogether for the better , and smiled back at her lovingly . They seemed beautiful to each other . " Are you calling me a fake ? " asked David . Jenny said , " Besides , maybe she did n't buy them at all . Maybe she inherited them , or they were given to her by a lover . " " Maybe , " said David , and a pleasant silence settled between them . At the Captain 's table , Frau Hutten observed that her husband was not eating well ; indeed , he was manipulating his knife feebly , raising an ill-laden fork from time to time for appearance 's sake only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effusion appeared on his forehead . When the talk , rather aimless , drifted around to the Professor , it paused there uncertainly , went around him and was taken up on the other side . Halfway through her own lunch , which she was enjoying , Frau Huttenin one flash of a thought was annoyed with her husband  --  so reasonable a man where the problems of others were concerned , so wise and all-seeing in abstract ideas , he was no more than a willful child when it came to a question of his own good . She had helped him to their cabin two hours before , he had allowed her to stretch him flat and put cold towels on his head , and he had , in his temporary weakness , promised that he would be quiet and allow her to nurse him back to health . Then without warning he had roused himself , had thrown away the towel and sat up , exclaiming in a loud , martial voice , " No , Kathe , this is a weakness of which I must be ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will , and this shall be conquered ... "  |p110Frau  Hutten , seeing that one of his stubborn fits was on the way , had tried to head it off , as if it were an escaping animal . " Ah , no ! " she protested . " I Iere , Will does nothing for you . Let your Will rest for the moment , and make yourself comfortable . This is no time for the exercise of the higher faculties . " Her husband had not troubled even to answer such heresy . He had risen , squared his shoulders , drawn his brows together over his nose , and , at the sound of the bugle , had taken her arm firmly under his . " Forward , " he said , " let us breathe the fresh air and take our food as usual , and leave all such nonsense as seasickness to our good Bebe who has no intellectual resources to speak of  --  it est chien de coeur , " he said , archly ; they then both laughed , jovially , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , unless they got away quickly , God knew what might happen . Losing her appetite so suddenly it left a great void that filled promptly with. , nausea , she did the one thing necessary to deceive her husband and persuade him from the table . " Excuse me , " she said , standing up without looking at anyone , nodding arounch the table slightly . " My dear , " she appealed to the Professor , " will you please go with me , I do n't feel very well . " Herr Professor Hutten rose at once , backing stiffly away from his place , overturning his chair , which he hardly noticed . Frau Hutten had to brace herself strongly to support the weight of his assisting arm . There remained nothing to do but to go , as swiftly as possible , without another word . Not until their cabin door had closed upon them safely did Herr Professor Hutten fetch a loud hollow groan . He fell face downward on the couch , retching . Bebe crawled out of his corner towardshim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure ; and Frau Hutten , overcome by the revolting sight , felt a dreadful chill down her spine . She fell back too , upon the bed , eyes closed . " Kathe , " called her husband , hoarsely , " Kathe , help me . " " Let me alone , " she said heavily , through stiffened lips . By means of a slow surging movement , she rolled over and reached for the bell , which she pressed down and held steadily , not letting go until the door was opened and she heard sounds of rescue in the room . Conscience , duty , attentiveness , obedience  --  all the granite foundations of her marriage , her wifely career slid from under her without a sound , and she sank into a hideous luxury of moral collapse . Let somebody else wait on him hand and foot for a , change . Let him do something for himself.  |p111Let  somebody even , for once , do something for her ! She was sick of the world . . . she was sick to death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief of the stewardess , whose rather amiably stupid , absent-minded face instantly chilled into hostility ; and the hand that poked spoonfuls of crushed ice into Frau Hutten 's open mouth was anything but gentle . Dr. Schumann , strolling about the deck after lunch , paused to glance at the horse races , set up for the first time since Veracruz , and was indignant when he saw that , in spite of his express orders , the boy with the floating kidney had been put again at the job of moving the toy animals along the track . A small number of passengers were sitting about comfortably , their faces smooth and at ease , eyelids relaxed behinddark glasses , enjoying the sunlight and the sea air ; but the boy sweated as he stooped and rose , straightening his lame back slowly , stooping again , with dark lines around his pale gray mouth , his eyes strained . The other boy was tough and able , but he kept his eyes down as if he were ashamed of his childish occupation . Further along , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , who seemed to be inseparable , playing ping-pong violently , and several persons were splashing about in the small canvas swimming tank set up on the lower deck . On the port side Dr. Schumann stepped carefully around a game of shuffleboard without observing the players , but nodding Good day in their direction ; and saw , at the same time , almost without seeing , Ric and Rae , the two Spanish children , beguilingthe ship 's cat , a fine tiger torn , with back strokings and ticklings under his chin . The cat arched , his face full of sophisticated pleasure , and allowed himself to be picked up between them . He was heavy , loose , ungainly in his surrender , and in his sensual trance he did not grasp the nature of their intentions towards him until it was almost too late . With sharpened faces and urgent hands , Ric and Rac lifted him to the rail and tried to push him overboard . He stiffened , dug his foredaws into the rail , braced and clawed fiercely with his hind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail became a wild plume . Silently , desperately , he fought with all his weapons . Dr. Schumann fairly leaped forward and seized the children back from the rail . They brought the cat with them in their rush ; he fell out of ' their clutches and tore his way across deck straight through the shuffleboard game  --  a thing he would not ordinarily have done , for hep112was a polite cat . The children stared upward at Dr. Schumann , their bare arms , striped with long bleeding scratches , going suddenly limp in his hands . Dr. Schumann , holding them firmly but with practiced gentleness , examined the depths of their eyes for a moment with dismay at their blind , unwinking malignance , their cold slyness  --  not beasts , though , but human souls . Oh yes , human , more 's the pity , thought the Doctor , loosening his hold . Instantly they wriggled free , their fierce little faces exactly alike except for the mysterious stigmata of sex , turning towards each other with their instinctive complicity ; then they ran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair flying . He supposed they should have , as a , matter of form , at least a few drops of iodine on those scratches , but he felt they would probably do as well without it . He sat down carefully in the nearest chair , breathing as lightly and deliberately as he could , holding himself together with intent stillness . He had a very ordinary kind of heart trouble and might drop dead at any moment . He felt his pulse softly with two fingers , but he knew the count already ; he knew exactly what was happening , what always did , or could , happen ' at the slightest shock or sudden movement : he had been over this rather dull case so often in the past two years there was nothing new to say or think ; above all , alas , nothing new to be done . He had always tried to avoid diagnosing and treating himself , he made a habit of consulting doctors he believed more able than he , he wished to believe in their procedures in his case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his trouble was . In the end , there was nothing in medicalscience related in his mind to what he knew about himself as physician , and what he felt about himself as a man in danger of death from , one moment to the next . He sat with the fated calm of a man caught in a thunderstorm in an open space , rather humorously counting on a scale of chance he knew to be mythical . At last , cautiously , he felt in his inside pocket and brought out the small phial of crystal drops . ... The thing he could never explain to himself about this incident was this : knowing about himself such a simple daylight fact , with his orderly plan to live as long as he could on whatever terms he could . make with his disease , he had endangered his life to save the life of a. , cat , a kind of animal he disliked by temperament ; he was devoted tO dogs . Given a moment for reflection , would he have leaped so and ( risked the stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had neverp113been required to face that emergency , and the idea was an absurdity , of course  --  of course the answer was clear , that question had been settled long ago , or so he hoped . He smiled inwardly , with a composed face , at the thought of the cat , that supposedly most astute and self-possessed of all animals , being seduced within an inch of his life by a tickling of his nerve endings , the pleasant crackle of his own electricity along the fur of his spine . Nothing in his celebrated instincts had warned him that those stroking hands were willing to give him a moment of his private pleasure so that they might the more easily seize him by the scruff for their own satisfaction . Perhaps that should not be surprising . It happened to others besides cats . Love ! said the Doctor , surprised that the word should have popped into his thoughts . He put it out again at once , with a proper regard for its true meaning . He had spent the best years of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , how else should he have spent them ?  --  patching up the deceived , the foolhardy , the willfully blinded , the lover of suffering ; and the most deadly of them all , the one who knew what he was doing and what he was bringing upon himself , and yet could not for anything resist one more fling at his favorite hot thrill of the flesh  --  drink , drugs , sex , food  --  whatever his particular concupiscencemight be , though it might be his own death . His own death , or my own death , I know it is of no importance , Dr. Schumann told himself , especially my own if I have made peace with it ; he touched his wrist again with two fingers and waited . He longed so deeply to live , even merely to breathe , to move within his familiar body , to stay safely within himself , a place he knew as home , he could not control the warm wave of excitement which ran all through him as if he had drunk hot spiced wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed his eyes attentively on the deep waves of the sea , turning upon each other endlessly , without thought , without feeling , moved by a power they obeyed in universal harmony . " My God , my God ! " Dr. Schumann believed in God , the Father , the Son and the Holy Ghost , and the Blessed Virgin Mother of God finally , in a particularly forthright , Bavarian Catholic way ; and having spoken the Name which included all the rest , he closed his eyes , gave himself over to the hands of mercy , and became soothed and quiet . Deliberately he removed his fingers from his pulse , ignored the beat of his heart upon his eardrums , and for a few seconds his whole being reconciled itself almost completely to the prospect of death , despising briefly , but withp114satisfaction , the cowardice of the flesh . He realized then that the drops were working , as they had worked before , as they might again and again work ; that the attack , a light one , was passing over ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed himself unobtrusively , noticing at the same time an arresting scene about twenty feet away . La Condesa was talking to a young sailor . He was a very attractive-lookingfellow , with a fine show of manly muscles in shoulders and arms , his cap sitting forward over an ingenuous sunburned face with a broad mouth and slightly snubbed nose . He stood perfectly straight with his hands at his sides , but his head was inclined away , and he looked past La Condesa with an occasional quick , uneasy glance at her . His back was to the rail , he was almost touching it , and La Condesa stood before him , talking very intently but slowly , spreading her arms as if she would bar his way . Her thumbs were turned in flat to her flattened palms , which moved in a monotonous beat ; her eyes were like agates , and she swayed from side to side , stretching her neck , trying to force the boy to look her in the face . His head turned from her , far to one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly always as if in deferential agreement , but full of shame and confusion . La Condesa patted him on the arm , at which he leaped as if touched by a live electric wire-end . His hand flew to his cap in automatic salute , he stepped past her and seized his bucket and brush , and made off in a long stride , his ears a burningred , leaving La Condesa standing . After a moment she walked slowly in the same direction , her neck and spine very straight , her hands clenched at her sides . Dr. Schumann , finding himself of at least three minds in the matter , that is , simple human curiosity at this freakish behavior , an unwilling admiration for the woman , who struck him as unusually beautiful , and that professional interest which had become second nature in him , rose and followed her at a good distance , keeping the appearance of being on a casual promenade . Within the next hour , the Doctor had seen enough to make him , very thoughtful . Wherever she saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was young , the Doctor observed with a good deal of moral ' disapproval , whether sailor or officer or passenger , she backed him into a corner , or against a wall , or rail , and somehow managed top115pin him there , standing before him and talking always in the same intimate way , as if she were imparting some agonizing secret with which they would be bound to sympathize . The effect on the several different young men was astonishingly similar . They began with polite listening expressions deepening rapidly to surprise , pained embarrassment , then to utter restlessness . Their faces would freeze in strange smiles , their eyes would begin to roam seeking a way out . At last in some pause in her uneasy flow of words , or suddenly as if signaled from afar , they would break away , no matterhow . Dr. Schumann never came near enough to hear what she was saying , but her gestures shocked him deeply , modest man that he was . She stroked her own breasts and thighs , patted the face of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression of her face was grief-stricken , her words seemed grave and hopeless . " Perhaps I am not young enough to attract her eye , " Dr. Schumann thought a little acidly , " I am no doubt much too far from the cradle for her , " but he decided deliberately to put himself in her path . He had a powerful sense of time and its effects on the human organism , and he felt that man owed it to his own dignity to live with philosophy within the limitations of his own time in the world . All other considerations aside , he reflected , there was something scandalous and perverse in older persons , especially women , who at their very best showed always disturbing signs of innate perversity , turning back to youth for sexual satisfactions : unnatural parents devouringtheir own young  --  a species of incest , in short , to put a severe word upon it . . . . Well , he would see . It was obvious the woman suffered from some acute form of nervous disorder ; she should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved her irresponsibility , and she must be friendless indeed . That was the first , the most dreadful effect of even a simple " breakdown "  --  the loss of human love and sympathy , the literal alienation from the common life of one 's fellow beings . Madness , he considered , having never separated the practice of his medical science from his theological beliefs , was the temporary triumph of Evil in the human soul ; he had never seen mania assume any but ignoble shapes . Let science do what it might , there was a mystery in the destiny of man beyond fathoming except in the light of divine revelation ; at the very bottom of lifep116there is an unanswerable riddle , and it is just there , concluded Dr. Schumann , his softened eyes still observing La Condesa , just there , where man leaves off , that God begins . La Condesa disappeared , walking rather fast , around the upper end of the deck , and Dr. Schumann turned through the bar and emerged on the opposite side intending to approach her slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuban students left their shuffleboard and swarmed about her . She put on a new air for them , gentle , graceful , indulgent . They fell in step with her and with each other , and fairly outdid themselves in deference and attentiveness to her . She was talk-y ing as they passed Dr. Schumann , and he caught a few words in her , frail , complaining voice : " Hunted like beasts , my children , my children , my lovely ones , and they ran away to sleep in the woods . . and I could only wait and suffer , suffer and wait  --  I could not lift a hand for them  --  " Her hands flew up and described a whirling ' ring around her head . " But they were right to revolt , they were rights ; my children , even if they die for it , or I must die , or be in exile .... " The students put on faces of exaggerated melancholy . She smiled at them blindly with frowning brows . One of the students fell back a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winked at Del Schumann and swiftly tapped his forehead with z forefinger . He gotreturn a stare of such stony severity it abashed even him and he mad haste to catch up with his gang . Dr. Schumann looked at his watclr4 drew a careful slow breath , feeling oppressed in flesh and spirit , and decided to lie down quietly for the rest of the afternoon . Lizzi Spockenkieker and Herr Bieber were having a very fast game of ping-pong , which had begun lightly and at once developed into a duel . They smashed the little ball back and forth over the net , crack pop pop crack , their strokes speeding up shorter , faster , their facet darkening with blood , until both grimly , silently , struck like automatons . It was a matter of life or death to win and they were smilin no longer . La Condesa with her three students who were singin " La Cucaracha " bore down upon them suddenly at Lizzi 's ba sailed by her without a pause or glance ; but Lizzi faltered , herflashed aside , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame ! " screamed Lizzi , and running around the table with long strides she cracked the triumphant Herr Bieber over his bald head with her little paddle . " Ah , if it had not been for that crazy ,  |p117woman  and those stupid boys  --  they  --  they  --  Oh why must things like this always happen to me ? " Herr Rieber ducked and sidestepped ; indulgently he soothed her : " Come now , even the best of us must lose sometime . Let 's not mind so much . Remember , it is the playing of the game that counts , not winning ! " " You can talk , " cried Lizzi , lifting her paddle again . Deftly he seized her wrist , brought her hand down to his mouth and imprinted a large , juicy kiss upon it . " There now , " he said , " what a quick pretty hand it is and it shall be much quicker the next time . Do n't mind not winning from me . I am ping-gong champion of the Sportsverein in Mexico City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " said Lizzi , calming down a little . " I am not used to losing at this game . " Herr Rieber twinkled instantly with immense meanings . " At what game then do you lose ? " Lizzi shook his elbow violently . " If you talk like that I shall leave you ! " she threatened , tossing her head like an unmanageable mare . " No , I sha n't listen to such things or answer them . " " Clever girl , " cried Herr Rieber , " nothing escapes you . Now suppose we take a little swim and cool off , unless of course you want to beat me again , " he said with infinite slyness , " at ping-pong or at any game at all  --  any game you choose ? " He squeezed her arm with such warmth that Lizzi blushed . " No no , let 's swim , " she said , her voice rising , " ah , we must have a race ! " At six o'clock a steward brought Dr. Schumann a message from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at once . A stewardess , waiting outside La Condesa 's cabin , knocked rather loudly when she saw the Doctor approaching , and moved as if to follow him in . " You may go , thank you , " said La Condesa to the stewardess , in the metallic quiet distant voice of a woman skilled in handling servantswhom she hated and who hated her , and she looked a shade to the right of the stewardess as if she were already not there . The woman , trained in the same school , backed out at once with her eyes fixed on a point in air about the height of the washbasin . The air of the cabin was thick with Turkish cigarette smoke , a mixture of heavy scents , and ether . Expensive-looking , badly worn lug/gage was spread about open , with shoes , evening wraps , improbable hats , wrinkled soiled fine gloves , and pale-colored unbotanical flowers of crumpled silk and shattered velvet tumbling out on all sides in a confusion past ordinary remedy . La Condesa was in bed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely veiled in thin violet-colored stuff . She sat up staring , opened her mouth without speaking , her clasped hands snapped apart and flew backward , forward , backward again , and she gasped at last , " You must help me , I believe I am going to die ! " Dr. Schumann summoned his calmest and most reassuring air , laid his palm on her forehead as though she were a child , and said , " I do n't think so , at least not just yet . " She bowed her head upon her raised knees and broke into a kind of sobbing , a crying complaining voice full of incoherent words , but , Dr. Schumann observed , without tears . He sat beside her and began to remove various contrivances from the black instrument case he carried . She stopped crying and peered into its depths with instant curiosity . He took advantage of her silence to ask her some plain necessary questions about her bodily functions and she answered plainly and sensibly . When ) however , he asked her to take off her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she simply sat and looked at him with a provocative flicker in her black eyes , and began to smile with sly glee ; she sat quite still , smiling sto , while he removed ' , them himself , She lifted her arms to help him with the sleeves , but that was all . He counted her pulse and listened to her heart and breathing , setting his ear firmly to her breast and shoulder blades , noting her long thin delicate bones . He flashed small white lights into her eyes , and took her blood pressure . He caused her to breathe deeply and say oh and ah several times while he peered down her throat with ' another little light . He tapped her ribs front and back rather sharply , with two fingers , kneaded her stomach in careful exploration , fetching a slight sigh from her . " Clench your fist , please , " he told her , antook some blood in a tiny glass pipe from the thin blue vein of her . inner arm . Her dilated eyes gradually became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoulders flat and still , gazing at him as if sh were rather pleasurably hypnotized , and said in an entirely change voice , " All these charming attentions are making me deliciously sleepy dear Doctor . Perhaps I only needed a human touch after all thosep119interrogations and those military police . They are very heavy-handed . " She breathed out lightly with her mouth open , and the smell of ether on her breath was very strong . The Doctor leaned towards her to speak , concealing his moral disgust at the discovery he had made in the first few seconds of the interview . " You do n't need stimulants , " he said gravely , taking one of her wrists and holding it lightly , " nor narcotics , either . Whatever you may need , " he said , his forehead gathering in a frown , " it is not ether . What a debased sort of habit for a woman like you ! Why do you waste my time calling for me ? So far as I am able to see , you are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " you are in enviably good condition , organically quite sound . How old are you ? " " Old enough as you can see , " she said . " Much too old . " " Perhaps fifty ? " " When you guess so well , " she said , " you deserve to be told you are right . Fifty , then . " " That does not seem so great an age to me now , " said Dr. Schumann . " I should be pleased enough to be fifty again . " " Ah , I would not be a day younger for anything . Believe me , there is not one day of my dreadful life I would live again . . . or so I think now . What shall I do ? Where shall I go ? What is to become of me ? I am exiled , " she said , sitting up again , and beginning to weave and sway , " my husband is dead . . . my husband , thank God , is dead , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my children , they are fugitives somewhere  --  here , now , while we are here talking comfortably , sheltered in this mean ship , but sheltered ! my sons arewhere do they sleep at night , who befriends them , who gives them food , where are they  --  when shall I see them again ? My house was burned too , " she went on in a lifeless voice as if she were reading a dull page aloud , " and my beastly servants all ran away , looting as they went  --  money , silver , clothes , furs , anything , whatever they had coveted ; they scattered out of the gates like the cattle they are . Every face I saw then was the face of someone who no longer regarded me as a human being .... " Her hands began to dance , her lips drew hack over her teeth , she struggled to get out of bed and knocked the instrument case to the floor . " Wait , " said Dr. Schumann . He rose , picked up the black case , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent at once and watched him with her air of easily distracted attention.  | " This for tonight , " he explained , " only . And you must not take any more ether . Where do you hide it ? I shall take it away with me . " She motioned towards one of the sprawling pieces of luggage . " It is all there somewhere . " He pinched up the flesh of her arm , and at the slight stab of the needle she shuddered and said , " Ah , how delicious . How I love drugs , any kind of drug , to wake me or to make me sleep , I adore than all . You should praise me a little , because I do not , ever , take all th kinds of drug I should like . It would be so easy , so easy . . . " She dropped back among the pillows , and Dr. Schumann rummag carefully among the disorder of the suitcase , bringing up a flask o ether . " Is this all ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She prolonged her silence , waiting to be cajoled , but he said nothing more . He went over to the washbasin and emptied the flask . Th fumes rose in his face and he coughed . " You have taken too many drugs of one kind and another , " he said , " say what you please . " " Do n't scold , " she said , " you have not told me what is to become of me , with or without them . " ' With your good health , " said Dr. Schumann , " I could wish you sufficient settled income and some reconciliation with society . And noth ing more could happen to you . " " How dull , " she said , blankly . " Maybe , " said Dr. Schumann , " for one of such specialized tastes . " " Here is the difference between you and me. do not intend to reconcile myself with a society I despise . Yet it was not I wh quarreled with society , but my sons  --  I was content to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into this world . . . . Look , I have such good health as you say . But no income at all . A prisoner oie her way to a dreary island in the Canaries ... " " I do not find Santa Cruz de Tenerife so bad , " said the Doctor* comfortingly . " You have not been deported there , " said La Condesa . " Cuba , knows , is dull enough , but Santa Cruz ! No , do n't try to console m ... You know what ? You sound to me like a man with money i the bank , entire personal freedom , all you want  --  and your heal is perhaps not so good ? How right am I ? " Right enough , " said Dr. Schumann , sitting beside her a ' Where is the rest of the ether ? "  | " You can see how useless , how unkind really , it will be for you to give me good advice , " she said , stroking his hand that lay on his knee near her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go away . I love your good advice , I love to hear you scold and see you frown straight into my eyes , as if you meant it just for me  --  as if you cared what happened to me . I should like being dull for a little while . I promise to stop taking ether , at least for this voyage . I do this for you , not for myself . I know I will begin again afterward . . . . I tried everything , anything at all , in the end ether seemed best , vulgar as you seem to think it ! A lovely excitement without pain . Have you ever taken it ? " " No . " " You must try it sometime , " she said , in a drowned voice . " The other flask is in the red leather dressing case . " " It is time for you to sleep , " said Dr. Schumann , and he laid her hand back at her side . " I shall send the stewardess now , and I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavenly drug I have now ? " asked La Condesa , her eyes closing slowly . " I do n't recognize it ; is it something new ? " Dr. Schumann gave a short laugh , at which she opened her eyes shining with delight upon him . " Do you expect me to tell you ? " he asked , as if he were speaking to an obstinate child . " You laughed , " she said , tenderly , " I never heard you laugh before ! But never mind , I 'll try to guess this drug , or maybe you will give it to me again . . . . I adore you , " she said , " you are such a preposterousgood moral dull ridiculous man , but charming , charming ! " Her eyes closed again , she lifted both hands and slowly stroked her small breasts upward , and her expression , especially about the mouth , quite startled Dr. Schumann . He shook her shoulder with careful violence . " Look at me , " he said sternly , " stop that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to one side . He stood almost holding his breath watching her sink into sleep as into the bottomlesspit  --  he touched her pulse lightly , and almost feared to leave her . He gathered up his black case and turned away resolutely , stopped himself from saying " Good night , " and opened the door . The dank air of the passageway struck upon him as a fresh breeze after the fetid sweetness and rot of the cabin . He instructed the waiting stewardess and returned to his quarters , feeling unpleasantly exhausted and freshly apprehensive about his own condition . He lay down with his rosary in his fingers , and began to invite sleep , dark/ness , silence , that little truce of God between living and dying ; he put out of mind , with deliberate intention to forget forever , the last words of that abandoned lost creature ; nettles , poisoned barbs , fishhooks , her words clawed at his mind with the terrible malignance of the devil-possessed , the soul estranged from its kind . On the second evening out from Havana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissary began doling out the modest pastimes and amusements of the voyage in the attempt to make life on shipboard resemble a perpetual children 's party on land . Dinner was " gala , " so the dinner card read , and fresh flowers appeared on every table . Besideevery plate were small gilded paper snappers with noise-making machines inside , and comic paper hats for everybody . Several of the women wore dinner gowns ; beer foamed in great steins ; waiters twirled bottles of Rhine wine in ice pails , with a flourish . Herr Glocken and William Denny , sitting together , put on their clownish hats first , grinned around vaguely and received a vague grin or two in return . Hats then bloomed on many heads ; small colored balloons floated about over tables , tossed from hand to hand , now . ' and agail exploding to the noise of rattles and tin whistles . The band struck up " Tales from the Vienna Woods , " and continued with Strauss waltzes to the end . Dinner was going to be treated as a social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if on the most provisional terms . There was a great deal of laughter and calling out of toasts between tables , and the Spanish dancing troupe leaned over and lifted their glasses to the Captain , who responded with a stony face but an elegant bow , raising his own in acknowledgment , setting it ' down again and seeming to put the whole thing out , of mind . Herr Baumgartner had got a false beard with his hat , and he sent " two small children at the next table almost into fits of joy with his trick of making it waggle up and down , like a goat 's beard . The children , a boy of five and a girl of three , were peaceably waiting , for food with their parents , Cubans who had embarked at Havana . ' Hans , the Baumgartners ' timid child , was enchanted with these chil-t ' dren , such a change from Ric and Rac , who could terrorize him with just a glance . He had been hanging shyly around these new passengerswithout daring to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saw his chance to make friends with them . Herr Baumgartner quite outdid himself with fascinating devices , andp123the children squealed and giggled and peeped through their fingers most flatteringly . Hans made himself laugh louder and longer than he wanted , to bring himself to their attention . " Eat your dinner , though , Hans , " said his mother after a while , " and we shall play some more afterwards . " Her husband disregarded this hint . He pushed the beard up to the middle of his forehead , parted it like a curtain and said " Boo ! " The children screeched with delight and the parents smiled indulgently . Herr Baumgartner pulled the beard down under his chin and pushed the paper hat far back on his head . The children still laughed . Frau Baumgartner took a morsel of food and set about cutting up the roast duck on Hans 's plate . She did not altogether trust his table manners in public for such things . Nearly eight years old and yet so awkward with his knife and fork  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . " Eat while it 's hot , " she told him . Observing her husband uneasily , she reflected that his great weakness was a lack of the sense of propriety , or the limits of things . He simply never knew when to stop  --  drinking , making faces , anything . Her heart sank as she perceived that now in a split second he would go too far , and he did . He pushed the beard up under his eyes , dragged his hat forward , agitated the beard fiercely , growled like a lion , maybe , or a bear , and it was too much . Hans , his mouth half-open to receive food , stopped and smiled uncertainly ; the other little boy laughed in a quavering artificial tone ; but the baby girl was too young to pretend anything , and she gazed in growing terror , then burst into tears . Lamentably she wept " Ay , ay , ay , " her flooded eyes fixed unbelievingly on the sight that had been so jolly suddenly turned dreadful without warning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herr Baumgartner , took the child on her lap and pressed the crumpled face against her breast ; the young father leaned forward to lay a tenderhand upon his frightened baby . Frau Baumgartner said , " Oh , I am so sorry , " and her tone , her manner , shut out her husband . Her eyes signaled to the other woman , You see how it is , please do not blame me . . . as woman to woman , as a mother who knows all that can happen , I beg of you . . . . The young mother gave her back the guarded look of an indifferent stranger , refused confidences , rejected implied kinship of feeling , and managed a deprecating small smile and nod as if to say , This is noth/ing  --  and thinking all too clearly , Except perhaps a little stupid , and what trouble you are making for us ! Herr Baumgartner swept the hat and beard from him , cast it ut terly away to the floor like a man in a play , his face tormented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed the father in German , " I meant , only to amuse the little ones . " The young father nodded , made a light gesture of waving away all misunderstandings , then exchanged a troubled glance with his wife , for they knew no German . Hest Baumgartner would have persisted , in Spanish , but his wife halted , him . " Do n't , " she said , " do n't . You have said and done enough . They understand perfectly , and if they choose to pretend they do n't at leaplease keep your dignity . " This completed the ruin of what was left of Herr Baumgartner'i self-esteem . " Ah , good God , " he said , " has it come to this with me ; , ' that I can not even play with a little child without frightening it ? Hans , you were not frightened , were you ? Your poor father hoponly to hear you laugh ! " " I laughed , " said Hans , with a manly air , comforting his father . Hi mother said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very funny . Littl babies always cry for everything . You cried when you were a littl baby , " she told him , so convincingly Hans forgot for a moment all th crying he had done since . His father ate in silence as if his food were bitter medicine to hi and the three of them fell silent . Hans felt that his mother was bein particularly gentle and that she smiled at him too tenderly , too often . It worried him to have to smile back every time , for he felt he was taking her side against his father , and he did not want to take sides : His father went on looking at him so kindly too , with his familisad face , poor good Vati ; until Hans could bear it no longer , bu turned his head from them both , unhappy and losiely and lost . Th children at the next table had forgotten the whole thing and wer playing with their balloons and rattles and hats while their moth and father fed them from spoons and forks and buttered their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another look or thought . Th little crybaby of a girl was having the best time of all . The festival spirit seemed to go on thriving more or less . The diners followed the band on deck , where the Strauss waltzes sang t the stars above the sound of the waves . The ship rolled gently , the heavy cooling winds whipped skirts and scarfs about , hair becamep125ruffled but faces were smoother , and the slow great waves folding back from the ship 's side were alive with lazy green fox fire . A gauzy new moon sailed downward swiftly . " It 's so heavenly , David , " said Jenny . " How I wish you would dance . " But David did not dance , and he had a not-heavenly name for dancing , a byword of contempt which offended Jenny , who had danced a distance perhaps twice around the globe . " And my mind was never purer than then , " she told him ; " I wish I had worn one of those measuring things on my ankle  --  then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was happiest ! " They enjoyed the light of the starry sky and the glow of the seaweed-colored deck , and breathed in the fine weather , but Jenny was restless , wanting to dance ; so David , with a tight , obstinate face , left her and went in the bar . A few minutes later he looked out and it was as he had expected : she was dancing with Freytag . The whole scene was filled with spinning figures whirling like cheerfuldervishes in the Viennese style . Mrs. Treadwell , dressed in some kind of airy yellow stuff , was dancing with a young officer ; Arne Hansen with the Spanish dancer they called Amparo . The absurd Herr Rieber clung as usual to the tall , awkward , ugly Lizzi ; he was as light as a rubber ball on his feet , and spun and whirled with the equilibriumof a top , guiding Lizzi in rings around the others . These others were married pairs mostly , though the Lutzes and the Baumgartners sat the evening out . Two of the Cuban students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancers sat in the bar and kept out of their way . David 's attention was fixed on those who were not dancing : the born outsiders ; the perpetual uninvited ; the unwanted ; and those who , like himself , for whatever sad reason , refused to join in . He ranged ' himself with all of them ; they were his sort , he knew them by heart at sight . That big Elsa for one , sitting with her parents , drooping , unable to conceal her yearning , her disappointment , her fear of being left out . " I would dance with you , " he told her , but she would never hear him say it . Herr Glocken , huddled on the foot of a deck chair near the band , his face in his hands , his paper hat over one eyebrow , sat motionless listening but not seeing . The dying man in his chair was drawn to the rail , wrapped in shawls and rugs to the throat , asleep perhaps ; the boy Johann , hisp126nephew who attended him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the look of an outcast dog for longing and hopelessness . David felt he knew all of them well . For himself , he refused to join in , to take part , because he knew well there was no place for him and nothing that he wanted anywhere  --  not at that price , he said , loathing the milling herd whirling past the window . The Mexican bride and groom , he noticed , were not dancing . Thev were strolling together , came upon the scene and paused there , amiable , distant , like charmed visitors from another planet . They did not dance or put on paper hats or drink or play cards or grin at other people . They did not even talk much to each other ; but they were paired , that was clear . This silence , this isolation , this ceremonial exclusionfrom their attention of all but their love and their first lessons in each other , seemed natural , right , superb to David . He surmised in them gravity and severity of character ; under their beauty there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the marriage would last , they were joined for good . As he imagined their characters and the nature of their marriage , which was the kind he believed he would want for himself , Jenny went dancing by again with Freytag . They were spinning gaily as one body , but their faces were only two fatuous masks . David , who considered sexual jealousy as a piece of nonsense beneath his notice , felt again that familiar hot wave of repulsionagainst Jenny 's lack of discrimination , her terrible gregariousness , the way she was always ready to talk to anybody anywhere , join up with any sort of party , go anywhere she was invited , take up with the most gruesome assortment of loons and clowns and thugs and drunks and perverts , and male model types like this Freytag . " To hell with it ! " said David aloud , feeling more bitterly trapped than usual . He returned to the bar and drank a whiskey neat , then another . Denny was there , and David had seen him hanging around uneasily on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take Denny into his sympathies . No , Denny was on the outside for the wrong reasons . He would follow and leer at the Spanish dancing girls  --  or rather , at Pastora  --  but none of them would have him . They had found him out . He would not buy them drinks , he would not come to any terms with them  --  he wanted his pleasures for nothing , the kind of man who should be whipped with scorpions and made to pay well forp127it . He honed and hankered , that was obvious , but not to the extent of a five-dollar bar bill , which might lead to nothing , or to more expense in the long run , and nothing gained either . The girls had got in the way of snapping their eyes at him in contempt as they passed ; a little more and they would be flipping their petticoats from the back at him , they had so low an opinion of him . They also fully intended that one of them , no matter which one , should certainly pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking steadily with a firm purpose . " I aim to be stinkin ' before this here night is done , " he promised solemnly . " Come on and get in the game . " " It 's as good as any , " said David ; and for a fact , Denny was just the one to get drunk with . No pretensions , no fooling around , no chatter , just a slow deliberate premeditated wallow to the finish . Fine , that would be just fine . David downed his third whiskey , and the small nagging dig of uneasiness , not quite pain , in that blank hungry spot just between his forward ribs , began to ease up a little . He intended to drink until no matter what happened he should n't be able to remember one thing tomorrow morning . Arne Hansen and Amparo ended their dance , a rather monotonous swing - around accommodated to Hansen 's awkwardness , within arm 's reach of Elsa , and Elsa gazed from under puzzled eyebrows at Amparo , trying to find the secret . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Amparo was beautiful in a slatternly too-dark sort of way , but she made no smallest attempt to be agreeable ; she had a sulky , unsmilingface , she hardly spoke , she seemed even a little bored and out of temper . Hansen , Elsa observed with satisfaction , danced like a bear . He kept his attention set upon Amparo as if she might disappearif he looked aside for a moment . Amparo carried and waved freely a black lace fan with a red cotton rose pinned over a torn place . Anybody with eyes in his head could see why the rose was there  --  anybody could see ! Amparo , her hips rocking , walked over and said something to Pastora , who left the deck and went in the bar to take a message to Pepe . Then Amparo walked away slowly without looking back , and Hansen took off after her with long steps . Frau Rittersdorf , who had just danced with the purser , a hugely fat , fatherly-looking fellow with a dumpling face and walrus mustaches ,  |p128found  herself standing near Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retreating figures . Hansen had overtaken Amparo , had seized her arm , they were hurrying away together . " I do n't think that is a very pretty sight , " she observed . Mrs. Treadwellturned a too-innocent face upon her and asked , ' Why not ? I think they look very well together ! " Pepe sat late alone , over a half bottle of red wine . Ric and Rac , Tito , Pancho , Manolo , Pastora , Concha , and Lola had finally deserted him . The band stopped playing , the dancers dispersed , lights were dimmed in the salon and on deck ; sailors came out with their buckets and brushes ; the man at the bar was obviously closing up for the night . Cigarette ends were stacked high in the tray before him , though the waiter had emptied it twice . Swallowing his last drop of wine , Pepe lighted another cigarette and strolled outside once around , and then , cautiously as a cat , descended into the depths of the ship . Lingering there , patrolling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking as if he had dressed in a hurry , enter the passage almost at a run and disappear around the far corner as if the police were after him . Pepe advanced then softly , opened the cabin door , and found Amparo as he expected , in her black lace nightgown , counting her money , in substantial-looking American banknotes , and a sizable lot of them . He put out his right hand palm up , rubbing thumb and forefingertogether humorously as if this were an old joke between them . Instead of giving them to him as she usually did , she tossed them into the washbasin , where he had to pick them out for himself . David Scott and William Denny woke from drunkenness with shatteringheadaches , eyes that would not focus properly , and sunken stomachs . Herr Glocken in a trembling voice was asking for his morning medicine and water as if he had been asking at intervals for a good while . Denny groaned loudly and thrashed about in the upper berth . David rolled off the couch and ministered to Herr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbler . Instantly his medicine was down , he gave David a proud , lopsided smile . " I drank too much , " he said , and dropped back behind the curtain . David , brushing his hair , noted with sickening anxiety the thin line of glossy skin at the top of his forehead where , at twenty-six years.  |p129his  hairline was slowly but fatally , visibly receding . Years might pass before it happened once for all , but there would come a day , an unspeakable day , when he would be bald , as his father and his grandfathersand his great-grandfathers were before him . No earthly power could avert it . He knew because he had tried everything . He had been guilty of buying every kind of hair tonic and salve and fancy shampoo and massage device any barber wished to sell him . At great damage to his Pennsylvania Quaker conscience , he had committed methodicallythe two greatest sins possible ( or so he had understood it as a child , from precept and example ) : he had spent on frivolities money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodily vanity . Not that he gave a damn , as he was fond of assuring himself ; but those tight-mouthed , tight-handed , tight-souled old gaffers had left some kind of poison in his blood that kept him from ever really enjoying his life , and besides , he was going to be bald . Still he blushed at having been such a dupe as to think , for example , that a hairbrush operated by electricity was going to destroy the genes of all those bald-headed ancestors . His inevitable baldness , then , he jotted down as one more grudge against his mother , who had never shown any judgmentas a mother , certainly , and least of all in her choice of the father of her children . His father had not only been prematurely bald , he was flighty , irresponsible , unfaithful openly in low ways , incapable of even the lowest form of loyalty to anything or anybody . He had the Quaker tendency to count his pennies , but that was all . He had finally looped out with a girl half his age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even ever heard of him , again . He left his wife a letter , though , saying that this new love was not based on mere physical attraction , as his marriage and many affairs had been , but was a matter of deep spiritual and intellectual interest as well , something too high and beautiful for his wife to understand . He did not expect her to understand it , and was not going to try to explain any further . It was Good-by , and Good Luck ! David was nine years old at the time , and had already thought soften how pleasant life could be if it were not for his father being around all the time . Now his disappearance seemed to David no less than a wonderful stroke of divine Providence , the source from which he had been informed all blessings arrived . His mother had taken the whole thing quite differently . " Spiritual ! " she had said violently , as if it were an unclean word . Then she said to David , " Here is the kind ofp130father you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high strained voice to him ; standing in the middle of the floor with her chin thrown back and her eyes closed with the tears streaming , she had nearly laughed her head off . Then she sat down and almost embarrassed him to death by seizing him , a big bony lank boy , and dragging him onto her lap , where she cradled him as if he were a little baby , rocking back and forth sobbing as if she would never stop . It had all made him so sick he threw up his supper , and afterward he got very sleepy ; but woke in the night with the most terrifying feeling of pure desolation . Quietly , secretly , he cried bitterly too , cried himself to sleep again in his dampened pillow smelling of old feathers . In the midst of brushing his hair , David vomited suddenly into the washbasin . Furtively with shame he scrubbed the bowl , thinking that his hair tonic was as bad as Denny 's patent medicines and laxativesand sleeping pills . He turned away from the sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of moral selfreprobationwhich Jenny called a Methodist hangover clutched him , not for the first time , in the vitals . He had done something ridiculous last night , what was it ? He rememberedJenny 's face somewhere along the evening , her eyes very brightly cold ; she was closing a door in his face  --  what door , and where , and why ? A great thunderous gap of darkness existed in his mind between a last series of drinks with Denny at the bar , and Jenny 's glittering eyes at the closing door . But she would remember , she would be glad to give him a full account . He had only to wait until they met at breakfast or on deck . She would tell him a story to please herself , half invention , half true , he would never know which was which , and she would be certain to add something like : " Do n't feel badly about it , darling . I 'm probably making it all sound much sillier than it really was . I was n't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purest hypocrisy : for Jenny was a sober little creature who did n't depend upon alcohol for anything . The thought of Jenny 's mere existence at that moment was a fresh accusation against him . I Ic should marry Jenny , or offer to marry her , anyway : they should have got married before they left Mexico  --  this way everything was plainly going to be a mess . But Jenny was not the wife he wanted if lie wanted a wife , which he certainly did not want now : in fact , he faced it coldly , he would never in the world marry Jenny , he did not intend to marry at all ; marriage was a bad business , a mug 's game.  |p131On  reaching this candid conclusion , his spirits improved somewhat : he felt able to face Jenny on her own terms . Herr Professor and Frau Hutten opened their eyes , moved their heads experimentally and asked in duet , " How do you feel , my dear ? " Comparing notes , they decided their seasickness was past , they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirring , took heart and walked about confidently , and when Frau Hutten kissed him on the nose , he responded with a hearty lap on her chin . The Indian nurse waked Senora Ortega gently and tucked the baby to her breast for the morning nursing . The mother drowsed and waked deliciously to the steady warm mumbling of the ravenous mouth , the long forward rolling surge of the ship , the sleepy beat of the engines . Her pains and fatigues were gone at last . Folded together , mother and baby slept as one in soft animal ease , breathing off sweet animal odors , cradled both like unborn things in their long dark dream . The Indian woman , who slept in her white chemise and full white petticoat , filled her palms with cold water , washed her eyes and smoothed her hair , slipped into her embroidered wool skirt , put on her earrings and necklaces , and lay down again , her meek bare feet , pointed and delicate , close together ; and dozed . Now and then she twitched a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not recognize , but believed to be her dead mother 's , often called her name in a tone of warning as she slept . " Nicolasa , " the voice said very tenderly as if she were a child again . But it meant to tell her the sad news that she was needed , she must break her night 's rest , she must all day long be silently ready to do whatever was required of her . She often wept in her sleep because she lived her whole life among strangers who knew only her christened name , not a word of her language , and who never once asked her how she felt . " Nicolasa , " said the soft voice , urgently . She sighed and sat up ; saw that her poor little baby was still asleep and the poor mother also , but perhaps they would be quieter , sleep longer and more deeply , if she kept watch over them . She drooped on the edge of her bed , smilingvaguely at mother and child ; then dropped to her knees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dried herbs in a cheesecloth bag was attached to the rosary , and she kissed this charm before she kissed the crucifix.  |p132Wilhelm  Freytag woke feeling a fresher , cooler wind blowing upon his face . The round bit of horizon shone through the porthole , not clear but a thick cloudy blue . They were six days out , yes , this was Sunday and the ship had settled to her speed such as it was in a beelineacross the waters , already , he noticed , putting out his head , a little troubled . It was real sea air , dense yet sweet and mild , with long sooty streamers of cloud trailing from deep blue thunder banks to the east . It seemed late ; perhaps he had missed breakfast . The ship 's bell clanged . Eight o'clock ; time enough if he speeded up a little . Hansen would miss it , though . The breathing of deepest slumber stirred behind the curtain , and Hansen 's huge feet , with smooth glossy soles and assertive great toes standing apart from the others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered how he managed in cold weather , and remembered being half wakened by the noise of Hansen scrambling into bed at what must have been a very late hour . . . . Probably up to no good with that Spanish woman he had been dogging from the first . While he shaved he riffled through his ties and selected one , thinking that people on voyage mostly went on behaving as if they were on dry land , and there is simply not room for it on a ship . Every smallest act shows up more clearly and looks worse , because it has lost its background . The train of events leading up to and explaining it is not there ; you ca n't refer it back and set it in its proper size and place . You might learn something about one or two persons , if you took time and trouble , but there was not time enough and it was not worth the trouble ; not even that American girl Jenny Brown was interesting enough to try to know better . By herself , a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lively talk and odd random humor that amused you at the moment , though you could not remember a word of it afterwards . But that strange young man she was traveling with gave her own personality a dubious cast : such as that odd behaviorof his last night , when he came between them abruptly during a waltz , seized Jenny Brown by the elbow and snatched her away , and had performed a few steps with her of a kind usually seen only in the lowest dance halls . Jenny Brown had to fight her way out of his clutches , and she succeeded for a moment ; turned to wave good night to Freytag , and then David Scott had seized her arm and she had given up and walked away with him . It was all pretty cheap and stupid , from Freytag 's viewpoint , and it illustrated the danger of getting involved with strangers and their messy situations.  |p133What  he , Freytag , preferred from strangers was a friendly indifference , a superficial pleasantness . This was quite enough for any voyage , any evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that too many persons know nothing about , he said , now beginning to carry on a silent , internal conversation with his absent wife Mary . People on a boat , Mary , ca n't seem to find any middle ground between stiffness , distrust , total rejection , or a kind of invasive , gnawing curiosity . Sometimesit 's a friendly enough curiosity , sometimes sly and malicious , but you feel as if you were being eaten alive by fishes . I 've never been on a boat , remember , said Mary in his mind . Ah , but you will be soon , you will be . You 'll see for yourself then . Would you believe , I danced with a girl , her name was Jenny something-or-other , had a drink with her , and a young man she was traveling with , rather a common sort of chap I think he must be , made the oddest scene about it . Traveling with ? He realized at once that such an episode was not the kind of thing he could tell Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was outside of their lives altogether , he would have forgotten it by the time he saw her again . And then too , if Mary heard such a story , she might say slyly , as she had said before when he told her of his travel adventures , often rather charming , he thought : " More Goyim , I expect ? " And he always had to say , " Yes . " And she would remark , " It 's so strange that you never meet any Jews when you travel alone ! " Once when he had tried to show her why he felt that this was an outrageous thing for her to say , they had almost quarreled ; she would not at these times accept a fact she knew well : that it was the Jews who drew the line and refusedassociations and friendship . But the subject was dangerous ground between them , and he had learned to avoid it . He felt his own life within him thriving safe and sound , something intact with a smooth surface very hard for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from that Jenny Brown and her private affairs , whatever they were . She was evidently at loose ends , ready for a little excitement . Her way of talking was too intimate , too personal ; she asked questions ; she wished to confide and explain about herself . She was not so interestingas her vanity led her to suppose . There was nothing he wished to confide or explain to anyone but Mary . He was very simply transporting himself , like something inanimatesent by freight , stored in the hold , until , from the house he had taken and begun to prepare for Mary in Mexico City , he should set himself down in the house where Mary was waiting for him in Mann/heim . In that interval nothing concerned him , he had no business with strangers . When they returned together , the ship and the passengers would still not matter , for it would be the voyage of their lives . They would never see Germany again , except for a miracle . Mary must be his native land and he must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate with them wherever they went ; they must call that climatehome and try not to remember its real name  --  exile . A vision of Mary playing and singing at the piano formed in his memory , and he whistled along with her the song she was singing : " Kein Hans , keine Heirnat .... " That was the way it would be . And what would it be like to know always , to carry the knowledge like a guilty secret , that they had not come to any given place of their own free happy choice , but had been driven there ; that they were in flight , harried over one frontier and then another , without power to choose their place or to refuse what shelter might be offered ? His pride sickened . What a shameful existence for any man , what a doubly shameful existence for a German ! No matterwhat he might say for the sake of politeness about his mixture of nationalities , he knew he was altogether German , a legitimate son of that powerful German strain able to destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure and German once more ; and the whole world had been for him merely a hunting ground , a foraging place , a territory of profitable sojourn until the day should come when he would go home for good , having never been away in his soul . Wherever he had been , he had felt German ground under his feet and German sky over his head ; there was no other country for him , and how was this taken away from us , Mary ? You are no longer a Jew , but the wife of a German ; our children 's blood will flow as pure as mine , your tainted stream will be cleansed in their German veins  --  Freytag pulled himself up with a sharp turn , and wiped his streamingface . His reveries had turned to a painful rhapsody , some fearful daydream had taken hold of him , he was talking his madness even while the solid earth was slipping from underfoot , the house shaking overhead , the long flight was beginning , and he could not even imagine the end . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninhabited , without incident or detail ; yet he knew that , visibly , nothingmight be changed for a great while ; perhaps things would change so slowly he might hardly be aware of change until one day it would be too late . No doubt he would continue as a minor executive in thep135German oil company until the time came to look about for something else in a firm where nobody would mind that he had married a Jewish girl . He dreaded introducing Mary to his circle in Mexico City  --  they would never be deceived by that blonde hair and her little tip-tilted nose . He had been deceived , but then he had loved her on sight , literally ; she had told him almost at once , but he had not cared , and he could see no signs of Jewishness in her  --  but those colonial Germans in Mexico City , they would know what she was instantly and as far as they could see her . He had seen it happen in Germany , in all sorts of places , restaurants , theaters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beyond belief and beyond help , and he could only hope that by the time the thing caught up with them he would have found another job as good or better , somewhere else . He might go in business for himself , in Mexico or South America , perhaps even in New York , but only as a last resort . Facing the perpetual question as he did , his mind turned dry and practical . He could not feel fated , destined for catastrophe ; actually he could not imagine himself being driven out of a place , or in peril of his life ; surely he and Mary would never be put on a ship , penniless , prisoners , to be thrust into still another country that did not want them either  --  like that unbalanced Spanish countess prisoner with her wild tale of terror . Poor woman , he found himself thinking with impersonal pity , but his own worry was such he was unable to care deeply for her fate . Leaning over the rail , he looked again into the steerage deck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a very thoughtful face . He greeted Freytag mildly and shook his head . " They seem to be more comfortable this morning , " said Freytag . The people were moving sluggishly , but they were moving , busy with their hands , putting things to rights as well as their means afforded . Some of the men were smoking , and the huge fat man in the cherry-pink shirt , who had sung as the ship left Veracruz , stood among them , legs apart , roaring another song , a few scattered words rising on the wind . The other men , rolling up their bundles or opening canvas chairs , stopped now and then to listen , smiling broadly , joining in for a phrase or two . The women had managed to wash a few garments , faded shirts and baby rags ; a long line of them flapped from a cord hung so low everyonecrossing the deck had to stoop under it . There appeared to be somewhat more space , and nobody was actively sick.  | " They will do well enough if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schumann . " Broken arms , legs , heads , maybe necks , " he said , broodingover them . " They have no place to make themselves secure  --  there are too many of them  --  it 's a disgrace to the ship . I am hoping the weather holds at least to the Bay of Biscay , when more than half of these will be left at Santa Cruz de Tenerife . " " It is always rough in the Bay of Biscay , " said Freytag . " Well , at least these people are lucky in one way  --  they are all going home . " " So they are , " said Dr. Schumann . " I hope only we can get them there without further suffering for them . " He seemed rather gloomy and under the weather himself , and barely nodded when Freytag moved away . In the areaway leading into the dining room , the bulletin board was a morning gathering place . David saw Jenny , looking very smooth and fresh , standing before the board with Mrs. Treadwell . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenny away at once and have it out with her . ' Why , hello , David darling , " said Jenny , easily , and slipped her arm through his . He gave it a small pressure , at the same time pushing her away . She let go at once and moved away a step from him . Mrs. Treadwellnodded a greeting , and together they read the thin array of pastimes , already somewhat frayed with repetition : religious services in the morning , a variation because this was Sunday ; horse races at two o'clock , swimming at all hours , music on deck at five , tea in the bar , a band concert after dinner , dancing on deck later . The little flags on pins , stuck every day in the map to mark the progress of the ship , were marching in a curve across the blue field of the Atlantic . " We are really getting somewhere , " said Mrs. Treadwell to David . " I ca n't sight land anywhere with my strongest glass . " From the Caribbean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vigo , to Gijon , to Southampton , to Bremerhaven , eight days more or ten perhaps . " We can begin to look forward to the end of this voyage , " said David . News dispatches were rather nautical in character and the movements of ships unknown to landlubbers were thought worth mentioning , with passing references to dockworkers ' strikes almost simultaneously in San Francisco , New York , Lisbon , Gijon . Passengers advertised on little thumbtacked slips of paper that they had lost orp137found jeweled combs , down pillows , tobacco pouches , small cameras , pocket mirrors , rosaries . The ship 's pool was there with the name of yesterday 's winner . Mrs. Treadwell traced with a bright red varnished fingernail the ship 's course on the blue map . She spoke , perhaps to David . " It 's true , " she said , " we do not stop at Boulogne . " Her face was amiable , timid , composed into a smile . He watched her sparkling fingernail glide into port , into Boulogne . " And that happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she told him , speaking into the air . " Then why did you take this ship ? " asked David . He waited confidentlyfor some preposterous feminine explanation . She was undoubtedly a woman who lost her keys , missed trains , forgot her engagements , and mailed letters full of indiscreet gossip to friends in the wrong envelopes . But no , she had a reasonable answer . " The man at the North German Lloyd in Mexico City sold me a ticket for Boulogne and said the ship stopped there , " she said carefully , without indignation or complaint . It was , she added , nothing unusual or surprising . Ticket agents often did that . " My ticket reads ... " She opened her handbag and rummaged among the contents delicatelywith a forefinger . David glanced over her elbow at a clutter of expensive trifles in gold , silver , leather and tortoise shell . Mrs. Treadwell removed a flat envelope of red ostrich skin bound in gold , her passport case . " It should be here , " she said , without expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself aloud . " At any rate , it said Boulogne , clearly . " " You have n't lost your ticket ? " asked Jenny , alarmed . " I have n't it with me , but it 's about somewhere . I am not the only passenger for Boulogne . Those Cuban medical students ... " " Montpellier , yes , I know , " said David . " I wonder what they mean to do there , what possibly ? " asked Mrs. Treadwell . " Surely not to study medicine ? " " Poor Cuba ! " said Jenny , idly . David asked how they would get there , in the first place . Mrs. Treadwellsupposed they would be put off , all of them and herself , at Southampton and from there  --  " It would be nice , " remarked Jenny , " if the Captain might just put them off in a leaky lifeboat , with two oars maybe , and a small keg of old water with tadpoles in it and a few biscuits full of weevils  --  I 'd love seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there . "  | " But what about me ? I want to go to Boulogne too ; from where I stand , that 's the shortest route to Paris . " " Ah , so do I want to go to Paris , " said Jenny . " The more I think of it , the more I hate going to Germany . That same man in Mexico told us if we changed our minds about Germany , we could always get a visa from the French consul at Vigo , and that is my one hope now . " Mrs. Treadwell turned smiling to David and saw with amazement that his face was pale and tight and he seemed silently enraged . " How nice , " she told him , saying what she had meant to say before she saw his face . " Do you wish to go to Boulogne too ? " " Not in the least , " he said , " I am going to Spain . " " And I am going to Paris , " said Jenny , sharply . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons throwing stones at each other . She stiffened and smiled , and almost furtively began to edge away , covering her retreat with little haphazard statements about the beautiful morning and a mention of breakfast . Could it have been possible they were ready to quarrel there before her ? The notion filled her with embarrassment and fright . As she hurried along , the smile must have remained on her face , for WilhelmFreytag asked her what she was looking so gay about so early in the morning ? She had no idea , she told him , and watched his gaze resting on Jenny and David , who drifted past together , both a little pale and strained in the brilliant light ; they exchanged sketchy nods . Freytag , with the stupid incident of the evening before fresh in mind , felt a certain lightly malicious satisfaction in his belief , his knowledge indeed , that no matter  --  no matter at all  --  what kind of appearances they chose to keep up , the match was no good ; they were not in the least happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . He turned as if for a last look at the retreating figures to fix an image in his memoryeven then changing and disappearing ; and before he could stop it , suppress it , before he even realized he had thought the fearful thought , it formed in actual words shockingly in his waking mind : " If that were Mary walking yonder , even at this distance , at first glance , anybody  --  even I !  --  anybody would know she is a Jew . . . . What have I done to us both , Mary , Mary . . . what shall I do now ? " It was all in a fraction of a second that his image of his whole life split apart . He turned back to Mrs. Treadwell with an amazed face , and suggested in a slightly raised voice that they breakfast together on deck . " Delightful , " she agreed , after thinking about it . They settledp139themselves and hailed the steward . The sunlight poured upon them , the waves glittered . Coffee was brought , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls and butter . The big white napkins reflectedsoftened light on their faces , their momentary well-being cast a brief pleasant glow forward over the whole unpromising day . As their fellow voyagers passed , Mrs. Treadwell noticed that at least half of them did not salute each other , not from distaste but from indifference ; she remarked to Freytag that the party last night had not seemed to change things much . Freytag said , in what sounded to Mrs. Treadwell a very good humor , that a few little incidents had happened , just the same , that might make changes in the long run . Mrs. Treadwell privately considered the few little things she had observed and decided that silence perhaps would be , as usual , best . Herr Lutz , alone and at his ease , stopped to peer down at their trays . " Ha , " said he , wagging his head at them , " eating again , eh ? Three times a day for a hundred years if we are lucky , what ? " Mrs. Treadwell 's plate seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the first time she had felt the coarsening effect of Herr Lutz 's presence on everything around him . Freytag was piling honey and butter on half a roll . " How true , " he said cheerfully , and engulfed the hearty morsel . Too handsome in that wrong kind of German way , Mrs. Treadwell decided , too carefully dressed , too healthy entirely , not an idea in his head , and it was a sad fact that too often the very nicest Germans wolfed their food . It had been noticed and mentioned by travelers through the ages ; she herself had never known one who was not a glutton . Freytag turned to her innocently , his mouth stuffed , enjoying his breakfast , and encountered her eyes for the first time fixed on him in a bland gaze , slender dark eyebrows lifted lightly , head on one side , a look that said nothing in particular but which threw him off center for an instant . He turned away and swallowed laboriously . When he looked at her again , her face was towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told her . " At home we used to have it English style , with all kinds of hot things , chops and scrambled eggs and broiled mushrooms and little sausages and muffins on the sideboard where you helped yourself , with a big urn of coffee steaming away . My wife  --  " English style of course for breakfast , and French style for dinner no doubt , and other imported styles for other occasions , with just now and then a comfortable lapse into the native Eisbein snit Sauerkohl andp140beer . ' What a hard-trying race it is , " thought Mrs. Treadwell , " and all their style , whether their own or imported , comes out in lumps just the same . ' Ich bin die fesche Lola , ' " she hummed , imitating Marlene Dietrich 's broadest lowest style . Freytag laughed gaily , and joined in with the line about the pianola . " Where did you learn that ? " he asked . " It 's my favorite of all . " " In Berlin , when I was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her best when she was being comic in her wonderful bull-contralto . How much nicer she was when she was n't being the romantic heroine in the movies . " He agreed , and added , " My wife collects that kind of disk , we have hundreds of them , all nationalities , all delightful low types , we love them . " He went on to say what a knack his wife had for making everybody around her comfortable , and gay too . " Life , in fact , " he said , " goes on better wherever she is . " And for a moment he was reassuredby the sound of his own words . His imagination began picking up the pieces of his shattered image and putting it together again ; it did look almost the same . It was true , or had been  --  it could still be . It was Mary herself who made the difference to his whole life , her qualities were changeless , what had possessed him to fall into a fright about their future ? The rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , maybe not so bad . He was sunk in shame and contrition for his abject disloyal thoughts ; he must be careful not to betrayanything of his doubts to Mary , who for all her gaiety and worldly smartness was easily upset and nervous : she woke screaming in nightmares and clung to him pressing her face under his arm as if she were trying to hide inside him ; but she could never tell him what had frightened her in her sleep . And there were times when she retreatedfrom him , from life itself , and would sit nerveless and sunken for a whole day , her face hidden in her hands . " Let me alone , " she would say , tonelessly , " I must go through it . Wait . " And he had learned to wait . Mrs. Treadwell tried without much interest to imagine his life , a moment-by-moment affair , no doubt , running along night and day betweenfour walls , with much hearty love-making under the feather quilts , and bushels of food ; with a smooth rosy calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun like thick crusty soup into deep bowls , her light hair in a braided crown . There would be an occasional opera or theater party ; frequent visits to cabarets and variety shows top141hear the latest comedians and bawdy singers . Plenty of wine and beer drinking at all times , and very special celebrations on birthdays and wedding anniversaries . She pondered his manifest contentment , based no doubt on lack of imagination and the family custom of hearty English-stylebreakfasts ; and gnawed her lamb chop lightly , finding it delicious . For all the money she had spent , and the things she had bought , and the places she had visited , she could hardly remember ever having been comfortable . Beggars pinch me , she reminded herself , and never for any price will I be able to buy a ticket that will set me down in the place I wish to be . Maybe the place does not exist , or if it does , it 's much too late to go there . And my husband preferred sleeping with any chance slut rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to please him  --  and he talked day and night about how he loved me ! Especially he talked about it to other people . And if there is a dull man on board ship I am certain to fall into conversation with him . Yet this one looked promising enough when Jenny Brown was hanging on his words . Freytag had been saying something , and she emerged from her warm bath of self-pity in time to catch the tag of his sentences : " . . . my wife is Jewish , you know  --  and we are leaving Germany for good  --  " " But why ? " asked Mrs. Treadwell . " I suppose there is no real hurry , " said Freytag almost apologetically , " but I prefer to make my own arrangements and to leave while there is time . " " Time ? " asked Mrs. Treadwell , without thinking . ' What is happening ? " Then her heart jumped , for she already knew the answer and did not want to hear it spoken . " Oh , same old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words , for the intelligent-looking , attractive woman beside him seemed remarkably obtuse and apathetic . ' Warnings of one kind or another . Nothing too serious , I suppose , but we " ( We ? he asked himself ) " have a habit of watching the weather , " he ended , and wondered at his weakness in having spoken so carelessly to this stranger . " Oh , you need n't tell me , " said Mrs. Treadwell hastily . " I once knew a Russian Jew who remembered a pogrom he was in when he was a child . He was six when it happened , " she told him in a light , gentle voice , " and he remembered absolutely everything  --  he gave terrible details  --  everything , except how he got away alive . That he did notp142know at all . Is n't it strange ? He was rescued and adopted and brought to New York by some people he had never seen until the pogrom , and he does not remember anything about any of it . He was a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages , all sorts ; he looked as if he had never had a trouble in his life . Do n't you think that 's pretty beauti-ful ? " Freytag was silent for so long that she turned her amiable smile , somewhat brighter than usual , upon him . He was picking at his thumbnailand looking as if he had got a blow over the head . " I should n't have tried to talk about it , " he said , with some underlying resentment , " I should never say anything about it . " " Perhaps you are right , " said Mrs. Treadwell , thinking , What do you expect of me ? What can I do ? She moved to put her tray aside . He took it from her and set it on the deck beside his own . They rose . " That was lovely , having breakfast here , " she told him , " it was wonderfulof you to think of it . " " Charmed , I am sure , " said Freytag , in a rather stagy manner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human nearness , of feeling . If she stayed to listen , she knew she would weaken little by little , she would warm up in spite of herself , perhaps in the end identify herself with the other , take on his griefs and wrongs , and if it came to that , feel finally guilty as if she herself had caused them ; yes , and he would believe it too , and blame her freely . It had happened too often , could she not learn at last ? All of it was no good , neither for confidant nor listener . There was no cure , no comfort , tears change nothing and words can never get at the truth . No , do n't tell me any more about yourself , I am not listening , you can not force my attention . I do n't want to know you , and I will not know you . Let me alone . Through David 's blurred eyes and rather seedy morale , Jenny had seemed so fresh and fair at the bulletin board before breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his anger against her began to simmer again ; it was indecent for her to look and behave like that after what had happened , whatever had happened , last night . Jenny for her part was in a fine state of mind , and for a strange reason . She had wakened early out of a nightmare , and even after her eyes were open she was holding her breast in horror , afraid to take her hands away because of the blood on them . Then her brain cleared and the vision dispersed like smoke , she was able to explain quite logicallyp143the whole train of her dream and its connecting links . Of course . The night before , David had stayed in the bar until he was glassy-eyed drunk , then had followed her and Freytag about , skulking along very like a private detective collecting evidence for the suspicious husband . Freytag had seen it all too soon , but pretended not to notice . They danced again , and hoped to escape , but David had pushed in between them and seized her by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After trying to free herself , she gave way and went with David , who kept his hard clutch on her arm . She had seen at a distance that he was utterly drunk ; he would be stubborn , silent , unmanageable , a lunaticin fact ; at such times she was afraid of him ; it was best to walk along with him and work her way towards his cabin , where she could manage to leave him . She realized very soon that his intentions were otherwise . He was leaning upon her shoulder and regarding her with a glazed , wandering , but lustful eye , and their direction was towards her cabin , not his . She turned cold with anger and disgust ; at the door , she wrenched her arm free , taking him by surprise , swung through and turned instantly to close it in his face . He braced against the panel with his shoulder , and she strained with all her strength on the other side . He stopped instantly when Elsa , who had started up in terror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing here ? " The door closed then and Jenny slipped the bolt . " Do n't be nervous , " she said , her voice shaking . " He is only drunk and a little confused . He forgot you were here . " Oddly enough , Jenny thought , Elsa connected the sordid little episodesomehow with love . She wanted to talk about love . She confessed she was afraid she might fall in love  --  she drooled the word rather , jenny noticed , which is perhaps the right way  --  in love with the wrong man , with that beautiful Cuban student , the tall one who sang and danced so well . " But I dare not let my mother suspect , " said Elsa , with something very like a tremor of delight in her tone . " Can you imagine what she would say ? " " Oh yes , I can , " said Jenny , " and you had better be careful . That Cuban will make you nothing but trouble . " Elsa thought this over for a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love makes trouble  --  that is what it is for . Trouble . " She drew a deep quivering happy sigh . " I should n't mind ! " Then she ventured rather timidly : " I think it must be divine to have a manp144so much in love with you . It seems to me so sad that you must shut him out . " " Sad ? " said Jenny , surprised at the bitterness of her feelings . " No , that is n't exactly the word for it . " After a long time of lying still in the darkness , listening to Elsa turn and sigh , Jenny slept and lived through again in her sleep something she had seen once in broad day , but the end was different as if her memory had patched together two or three unrelated bits and pieces to contrive a meaning for the whole which the separate pieces lacked . During the first month after she began to live with David , she had gone by bus from Mexico City to Taxco , to look at a house there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed down in passing through a small Indian village with the little thick-walled windowless houses sitting along the road , the bare earth swept before each door . The dust was bitter to taste , the heat made her long for sleep in a cool place . Half a dozen Indians , men and women , were standing together quietly in the bare spot near one of the small houses , and they were watching something very intensely . As the bus rolled by , Jenny saw a man and a woman , some distance from the group , locked in a death battle . They swayed and staggered together in a strange embrace , as if they supported each other ; but in the man 's raised hand was a long knife , and the woman 's breast and stomach were pierced . The blood ran down her body and over her thighs , her skirts were sticking to her legs with her own blood . She was beating him on the head with a jagged stone , and his features were veiled in rivulets of blood . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience in suffering , abstract , purified of rage and hatred in their one holy dedicated purpose to kill each other . Their flesh swayed together and clung , their left arms were wound about each other 's bodies as if in love . Their weaponswere raised again , but their heads lowered little by little , until the " woman 's head rested upon his breast and his head was on her shoulder , and holding thus , they both struck again . It was a mere flash of vision , but in Jenny 's memory it lived in an ample eternal day illuminated by a cruel sun , full of the jolly senseless motion of the bus , the deep bright arch of the sky , the flooding violetblueshadows of the mountains over the valleys ; her thirst ; and the gentle peeping of newly hatched chickens in a basket on the knees ofp145the Indian boy beside her . She had not known how frightened she was until the scene began repeating itself in her dream , always with some grotesque variation which she could not understand . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she were at a play , and the two narrow white-clad figures were unreal as small sculptured altar pieces in a country church . Then with horror she saw that their featureswere changing , had changed entirely  --  the faces were David 's and her own , and there she was looking up into David 's blood-streamingface , a bloody stone in her hand , and David 's knife was raised against her pierced bleeding breast ... . In her relief at waking , and her melancholy in remembering that time when she had been enchanted with David and had believed in their love , she almost wept . The tears rose back of her eyes and dried there . She still believed she loved David , but whatever it was that he understood as love was a mystery to her . She believed she thought of love as tenderness and faithfulness and gaiety and a true goodness of the heart to the loved one ; she wanted David to be comfortable , she wished to be easy within herself , and though David seemed coldly to devour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would not take her into his confidence , he would give nothing back . He sulked when she was painting and could not do his own work , but wandered about aimlessly . He disliked her friends , and made none of his own . He would not listen to music with her , he would not dance , he would not share her moods or allow her to share his , or to make some sort of life of his own that she might share , if he could not take part in hers ; he lived like a willful prisoner within himself , he would not let the door be unlocked . Lying there with her arms under her head , her list of accusations grew . They had agreed in the beginning not to marry because they must be free , marriage was a bond cramping and humiliating to civilizedbeings : yet what was this tie between them but marriage , and marriage of the worst sort , with all the restraints and jealousies and burdens , but with none of its dignity , none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intention . Ah , it was high time to think a little . She had fallen in love with him recklessly , on sight ( why ? ) , and she went over the hurdle at once because she ( lid not dare to hesitate , to think of anything . Once they were together , she no longer felt reckless , but happy and right in her feelings andp146strangely bound to David . She had believed he felt the same , for a year at least she had been certain the bond was real and would hold fast . They were going to make a splendid life together . Little by little she had been dismayed by his stubborn resistance to love , as if it were an evil force outside of them both , instead of a force of life they both possessed and exchanged with each other , and by his refusal to take part in any plan that would engage him for even the nearest future . She had believed that his recurring fits of long silence were evidences of strength and reserve power of character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly , as if the binding strings of his characterwere cut and he fell apart . She had believed that his contemptuousdismissal of all her friends was the sign of a discriminating taste and judgment superior to her own . Now it seemed to her that David watched and listened so narrowly for the fallacy , the blind spot , the small but certain marks of weakness and vulgarity in others because finding them soothed his own fear , lulled his deep uncertainties about his own qualities . She wanted to cry out , " Oh David darling , there 's nothing to be afraid of ! It 's only this world ! Let 's not mind it ! " Had he always been Iike this , or was it his defense against her ? And why should he defend himself ? And had he been like this all along and she could not see it because she had been so much in love ? But what was there to love in him , then ? How could she have loved him ? She began to wash and dress with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question had been asked , and it carried its own answer  --  not the answer she had expected  --  what had she expected , then ?  --  but it was an answer and she would accept it . We will go on for a while , and it will be worse and worse , and we will say and do more and more outrageous things to each other , and one day we will strike the final death-giving blows . There is nowhere to go back and begin again with this . . . there is no place to go . The past is never where you think you left it : you are not the same person you were yesterday  --  oh where did David go , I wonder ? The place you are go ing towards does n't exist yet , you must build it when you come to the right spot . Oh , God , do n't let me forget any more what really happened to me . Do n't let me forget . Please help me ! When jenny saw David a few minutes later at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the purging of her bitterness . If she could possibly help it , she would not quarrel with him anv more . She was going to separate from him at the dock in Bremerhaven ,  |p147and  go straight to Paris , and he could go to Madrid as he wanted ; and meantime  --  The very first words she spoke to him were full of provocation ; she could hear them as they must sound to David . She could not stop herself . As she poured his coffee she glanced about the dining room and greeted almost everyone who entered . " I see that all the drunks and seasicks are up and tottering about , " she said , " even your cabin mates . 1 ) o you ever get lonely in there , darling ? Ever feel like coming in to spend the night with Elsa and me ? " David turned a pallid green and braced himself . " Was that it ? " he asked . " I knew it was something good . Go ahead and tell me . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember something more  --  something interesting you did when I was not there ? You never remember what happens when you 're drunk , do you ? I think that must be superbly convenient . " He gazed into his plate and said nothing . She studied the very fine clear modeling in the outer corners of his eyes , and the touching inner corners with their thin blue veins in the lids . The nose was especially fine . The set of the ears . The whole head , long and narrow . She had made dozens of sketches of his head , trying to catch exactly what she saw , but none of them were ever enough like to please her ; maybe she could bring it out in color . The face was a curious mixture of sensibility , with some elements very hard , and others very petty  --  perhaps it was in the mouth . David ate as if there were no God , and he never gained an ounce ; there was a starved look about him . She had never even heard of anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ; sometimes it was terrifying . She would go back on tiptoe to have another look at him , listening to his breathing . On Sundays and holidays he slept for sixteen hours on end . He would wake looking tired as if he never hoped to catch up on his sleep . He loved to loll in water without ever having learned to swim , and he could lie on a mat suninghimself for hours , idle as a dog . When he drank whiskey , deliberatelyhe went on with it until he was in a stupor . He practiced all these dull excesses in a methodical , uncommunicative frenzy of cold yet sensual enjoyment ; and when he made love , Jenny knew he forgot who she was . Yet he still managed to look like an innocent young monk during Lent . He had told her once that his mother had not been able to keep him after she was deserted by his father  --  he had a nasty younger brother who cultivated asthma as a means of getting his moth/er 's whole attention  --  and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sour-smelling old great-aunts who never gave him enough to eat . Hunger was in his bones , in his soul . Vague maternal feelings of the kind she abhorred in herself welled up in Jenny . " David , " she said , in a soft , blurred voice , and he saw with surprise again the now familiar change in her face , just when she had been in her most difficult and perverse mood , the gentle blinded look of abject tenderness , mysterious but real for the moment , touching and believable . " What is it , Jenny angel ? " he asked very gently , and waited for her to repent of something , to offer some concession he had not asked of her , which later she would take back and deny when her mood had changed and hardened again . He was tired of trying to understand her , and he knew by now that he could not depend upon her for anything at all . " I am glad you have decided to go to Spain , " she said . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad ! ) " Let 's go there first . I 've always wanted to go to France , I shall always want to go . Any time at all . And one day I shall . It will always be there . I have time . But you want to go to Spain now . So let 's . I wish we had never drawn those straws . " " It was your idea , " said David , relentlessly . " I have a notion we 'll land up in France , after all . " " Oh no ! " cried Jenny , though her eyes lighted at hearing the mere words . " No ! We are going to Germany , God help us , unless we can get a visa at Vigo , and if the ship stops at Boulogne , after all . Those Cubanboys are saying there is an old maritime law the Captain is bound to put you down at the port you have paid passage to . But the purser told Mrs. Treadwell that the fare is the same to every port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop anywhere he does n't please between Gijon and Bremerhaven . And the Captain has said positivelyhe does n't please to stop at Boulogne . So darling  --  when we get to Bremerhaven , let 's toss a coin , once : heads for Spain , tails for France ; and let 's buy our tickets then and there before something else happens to start us off on another tack . " She became very gay at the prospect of settling a question . " Oh , David , let 's just do this and end the worry . This would be such a nice voyage if only we knew where we were going ! " David could not or would not make the decision . " Let 's wait , " hep149said , after a long uneasy pause . " I do n't know yet where I want to go . " He was annoyed at the situation getting out of his hand , rather ; he had meant to quarrel with her about her carryings-on with that preposterousFreytag ; for once he had her fairly in the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give him a comic and cruel account of his behavior of the evening before . But there was nowhere to start , no common ground  --  their separation had begun , the distance between them had widened without warning . There is no moment of peace , thought David , except in that split second of hope , of belief even , that now , now you have it . If we go on together , she is going to be unfaithful to me , she is going to have " affairs " as she did before . Why go to Spain with her ? Why should we go anywhere together ? Her life , or her version of it to him , had been a disordered history of incoherent events , apparently meaningless wanderings . " Oh , no , " Jenny would protest , " it all meant something marvelous to me , " but what the marvel was she never said . She could never explain her real reasons for having been in certain places , or what she was doing there . ' Why , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . My grandparents were dead , and the house was sold , and they had almostnothing to leave me  --  I had to make a living , did n't I ? And I was n't very good at it  --  I 'm still not , but I do try ! I had a job there . " A man , or men , always seemed to lurk in the background . " Good heavens , David , of course there were men . What do you take me for ? " .. . " Why no , David , of course I never married anybody , why should I ? " She would never admit that she had loved any man but David , and more curious still , she would never admit that any man , except perhapsDavid , she would wait and see , had ever loved her . " None of it meant anything at all , David darling , " she assured him over and over with earnest innocence , " nothing lasted . It was just for the excitement , David . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could never understand why , for him , the whole wrong lay precisely there . It should have been love , it was a disgrace to her that it was not love ; and , he told himself with bitterness , it is n't love again , I expect . Maybe it will never be anything but fox fire . It was Sunday morning , after all , as the godless were reminded by a sight of the godly wearing Sunday faces going each one to his own kind of worship . At six o'clock Father Carillo was down on the steerage150deck , saying Mass before a portable altar adorned with small lighted candles and limp red paper flowers . The people knelt and rose and knelt again , huddled shoulder to shoulder , with bowed heads and moving lips , their hands fluttering constantly in a complicated series of signs of the Cross . Among them all , only six women were in a state of grace . They crawled forward on their knees , their heads shawled in black , to receive Holy Communion . Raising their chins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust forth their pallid tongues to inordinate lengths to partake of the Angelic Bread . The priest went through the ceremony severely and hastily , placing the wafers on the outstretched tongues expertly and snatching back his hand . He ended the Mass in due form but at top speed , and almost instantly began to pack up his altar as if he were removing it from a place of pestilence . At the farthest end of the deck from the altar , a considerable group of men who had stood throughout the ritual with their backs to the priest now faced about and began to disperse . In silence , without any other demonstration , they expressed contempt and anger even in the movements of their hands , exchanged scornful derisive smiles . The ' fat man in the cherry-colored shirt seemed to be the ringleader . He walked deliberately against a man who was still kneeling , his ragged cap in hand , almost knocking him over . The man got to his feet , put his cap on slouchwise and squared up to the other , who stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wipe that dirty look off your face in the presence of the Host , " said the man who had been jostled , with extraordinary ferocity . " In the presence of what ? " asked the fat man . " I see a eunuch with a bread pill . " They struck at each other 's mouths almost at the same instant ; the smaller man leaped and tripped the fat man , they crashed to the deck together and fought with deadly fury for a few ' seconds , when half a dozen men seized and separated them by force , holding them intently , while the women scattered , crying out and stumbling over chairs and bundles . Father Carillo picked up his altar and made for the stairs without even a glance towards the unseemly disturbance . When the men who had fought were freed and standing , there was blood on their faces and their torn clothes . Their eyes , quite murderous and calculating , met for an instant in a promise that this was not the end ; then they walked away from each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rag , each surrounded by his own friends , or guards as they had become . At seven , in the small library off the main salon , Father Garza said Mass attended by the troupe of Spanish dancers , the bride and groom , Dr. Schumann , Frau Otto Schmitt and Senora Ortega , who was pale and blotchy so early in the morning , and who leaned upon the shoulderof her Indian nurse . All knelt upon the carpeted floor , missing their padded prayer stools , the soft hot wind bringing out drops of sweat on their foreheads . The Spaniards knelt closely together , their bitter faces closed smugly , their dingy slender hands twiddling with their rosaries . Frau Schmitt , observing that the bride and groom knelt at a discreet distance from each other and did not even once exchange a glance , approvedthis delicacy of behavior . She then covered her face with her hands to shut out all distractions , and gave herself up to soft emotions , remembered blisses of mingled love and prayer , a melting sweet , ageless vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the sins of the world only in Thy grace shall my soul be healed . Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death . Near her , Amparo stirred , rustling her petticoats and rattling her beads , ' hissing her prayers under her breath , exuding from every pore a warm spermy odor mixed with the kind of perfume only the lowest  --  sort of . woman would ever use . Frau Schmitt , disturbed by the sounds and the smells , body odors and stale hair oil added from all sides , moved away a few paces on her knees , then stopped , feeling foolish . Her happy mood was shattered . She sat back on her heels , resigned and dull , opened her eyes and followed Father Garza 's formal gestures as he murmured in a low voice . She knew it all by heart , but feeling cheated of her rapture , she stole glances now and then at the Spaniards , who had cheated her . They were peculiarly repellent to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The presence of Dr. Schumann , the good and wise man , was comforting to her . She felt she knew him well , ah , he was the kind of man she understood and who would understand her . A tender , sunny memory of her honeymoon at Salzburg rose like a little painting framed in gold in her mind  --  her new , wonderful , ever-to-be-wonderful husband with her in their first room together in the White Horse Inn at St. Wolfgang 's ; the lovely green summer light everywhere ; the small white steamer coming in from a trip aroundp152the lake , and everyone going down to a wharf no larger than a school platform , to meet it as if it came from across the sea . . . and the littlegilded globes dancing in the fountain spray at Hellbrun , and the darling little dwarfs and gnomes in glazed colored crockery peeping out from hedges and flowerbeds ! Ah , those Spaniards with their harsh faces and hating eyes , if ever they had seen the white marble statue of the martyred Empress Elizabeth at Hellbrun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was a sad voyage , her last in this world maybe , and what a pity most of the people around her were so unpleasant . She was so bitterly lonely for her husband , one night she had put herself to sleep imagining that she might get up and go down into the hold , and just sit there by his coffin in the dark , for the dear companyof it . Then in her sleep she had gone down , and there at the door stood her husband shining like moonlight on the sea , and he had said , waving his hand , " Go back , go back , go back , " just that and nothing more , three times ; and had disappeared . She had waked in a fright , turned on her bed light and begun to say her rosary ; and now she had only to resign herself to not seeing him again in this poor world , and to try not to let her heart be hardened against the poor and the unfortunate  --  for surely those dreadful Spaniards were both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished only to be quiet and happy , each in his own way : but there was a spirit of evil in them that could not let each other be in peace . One man 's desire must always crowd out another 's , one must always take his own good at another 's expense . Or so it seemed . God forgive us all . Herr Lowenthal , wandering moodily alone , after having put on his phylacteries and said his morning prayers , was brooding hopelessly on Herr Rieber 's treatment of him . It was not a matter of rude words , for Herr Rieber would hardly speak to him , and if Herr Lowenthal asked a civil question he got only a grunt for answer : the trouble was that Herr Rieber behaved as if he were alone in the cabin , and had all the rights and space there . He pushed Lowenthal 's belongings around as if they were mere trash in his way . Once he had deliberately swept all of Lowenthal 's toilet things off the shelf to the floor , breaking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the decency to pretend it was an accident . If Herr Lowenthal hung his pajamas in the small locker near Herr Rieber 's garments , Herr Rieber , with a nasty fastidious expression , han/dling the pajamas between thumb and forefinger , would remove them and let them drop to the floor . And all this , mind you , in the most confident insolence , as if he knew he could dare venture to any lengths without fear of consequence . Herr Lowenthal , accepting all this without present protest , making up his mind painfully to endure in silence and wait as patiently as he could for the end of this monstrous situation , spent a good deal of his time trying to find a place of his own to stow his property that could not possibly be claimed by Herr Rieber . He repacked his suitcase and samplecases , put his new supply of toilet articles in a bag , and set them all in the corner opposite the bunks , at the foot of and under the couch . Once he found them all in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lower bunk . There would be no end to it , that was clear . Herr Lowenthal with some wry humor began to think of Herr Rieber as that fabulous German household sprite of mischief , the poltergeist . No poltergeist could have been more persistent in malice . All this so soon , what would not Herr Poltergeist think of to make himself tiresome before they reached Bremerhaven ? This dark question in mind , Herr Lowenthal on deck glanced through the window into the small library and saw the Mass going on . He restrained his impulse to spit until he had passed beyond the line of vision of the worshipers ; then , his mouth watering with disgust , he moved to the rail and spat like a landlubber into the wind , which blew it back in his face . At his curse being thus returned to his very teeth , his whole body was suffused with superstitious terror , it scurried like mice in his blood , it shook his nerves from head to foot . " God forbid , " he said aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nearest deck chair . Father Garza came out in a few minutes , looking very refreshed and good-natured after the performance of his religious duties , lifting his cassock skirt and plunging his square bony hand into his trousers pocket to fetch forth a packet of cigarettes . Father Carillo joined him . They both beamed amicably upon Herr Lowenthal , whose gaze was fixed unseeingupon them . " Good morning , " said the fathers , affably , in very had German , and Father Garza added , " It 's a beautiful day we are having . " They paced on slowly , and Herr Lowenthal in his pit of misery did not even hear them until they were gone . He pulled himself up laboriously . " Griiss Gott , " he said forlornly , to the empty air and the bitter rolling sea.  |p154There  being no Lutheran minister aboard , the Captain assumed leadershipof the religious observances suitable to the day . At eleven o'clock all the guests at his table except Dr. Schumann and Frau Schmitt gathered in the main salon , and were joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glocken and the Lutz family , the Baumgarmersand their son Hans . Even Wilhelm Freytag , who happened to be already present , stayed on for the service . The Captain read a few verses of Holy Scripture in his most commanding voice , and said the appropriate prayers , his congregation listening respectfully with bowed heads . Everybody joined in several fine rollicking hymns , their firm warm voices carrying all through the ship , even out to the bar , where the barman stood listening thoughtfully , with a pleased face , nodding in time and humming under his breath . Frau Hutten , Frau Rittersdorf and Frau Schmitt retired to the shady side of the deck prepared to sit there in Sunday dullness waiting for their dinner . Herr Professor Hutten took part in a conversation with the Captain and Dr. Schumann , a short distance away . Their voices were low and their manner earnest , so the women gave up trying to overhear , and Frau Hutten , observing that Frau Rittersdorf was writing in her notebook , kept a considerate silence , fumbling absently with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Americans , " wrote Frau Rittersdorf neatly , " have quite commonplace names , after all , Scott and Brown . Braun the name no doubt was , and perhaps the young woman is of German origin , though I should detest thinking so . One more un-German in every respect it would be difficult to imagine . Angel and Darling are their love-names for each other . In quite bad taste of course , and much exaggerated besides , as neither of them is in the slightest degree attractive . She is a dry thing like too many American women  --  even the beautiful ones have no real freshness , but seem either like painted wood or just on the point of fading . This is caused , I am told on good authority , by their almost universal custom of losing their virginity at puberty or even earlier , and thereafter leading lives of the utmost promiscuousness . But this young woman is not beautiful in the least ; I should think she might have encountered difficulties in losing her virtueat any age . As for the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for himself , and indeed , is quite all that he deserves . " She tucked her pen in the narrow pocket on the back of the book andp155leaned back cheerfully , thinking she had well repaid that pair for misleadingher in the first instance . She turned to speak to Frau Hutten , when her attention was arrestedby the queer behavior of Herr Rieber and Fraulein Spockenkieker , engaged in a most unedifying scuffle at the rail . Herr Richer was wearing the lady 's green and white scarf around his neck , and she was rather pulling him about by the ends . Frau Rittersdorf snapped her face-a-main upward for an instant . Yes , that girl was pretending to tie a bow under Herr Rieber 's chin , but she was really drawing the noose about his windpipe until he clutched for air and his beaming smile almostdisappeared in a blue cloud of distended veins . She then loosened the knot , and the good-humored martyr went through a pantomime of coming to life again , gratefully . His whole attitude was offensive to Frau Rittersdorf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to amorous persecutions from any woman , no matter how irresistible her charms . More properly the other way about , for the crown of womanhood was suffering for the sake of love . A positive thrill of sensual excitement ran through Frau Rittersdorf 's frame as she tried to imagine what would have happenedif ever she had , no matter how playfully , attempted to strangle her Otto . " Let us have some beer , " shouted Herr Rieber gleefully , stuffing the scarf in his pocket , where it dangled like a tail , and the shameless pair ran away , followed by a row of censorious glances . Frau Rittersdorf remarked to Frau Hutten , in a sweet charitable voice : " If one judged always by appearances , how often one would be obliged to t oink the worst . " Frau Hutten stirred lazily , and after reflection , answered with indulgence : " Ah well , it seems that neither of them is married . Who knows , it may be a match . " Little Frau Otto Schmitt ventured : " They seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man taller than the woman . " The three then noted that Captain Thiele , Herr Professor Hutten and Dr. Schumann were still absorbed in their talk a safe distance away . They gave free rein to their womanly tongues without fear of being overheard by the men , to whom such talk was always trivial , unworthy , and fair game for their male sense of ridicule . " Fraulein Spockenkieker is a divorced woman , so I have heard , " saidp156Frau Rittersdorf . " She is , I am given to understand , a woman of business  --  a lingerie business of sorts , she has three shops and has kept her maiden name in all circumstances . No wonder she no longer has a husband . It may also account for her manners , or lack of them . " " I wished to continue with my teaching after marriage , " said Frau Hutten , with wifely pride , " but my husband would not hear of it for a moment . The husband supports the family , he told me , and the wife makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred mission , he said , and she must be prevented at all costs from abandoning it . And so it was . From that day to this . I have done only housework , except to act as secretary to my husband . " Frau Schmitt blushed . " I taught for years , " she said , " in the same school with my husband , who was in poor health , almost an invalid , after the war . He could not carry a full professorship ; it was important for him not to be too heavily burdened . We had no children , what else should I have been doing ? There was not enough to do in our simple little house to keep me occupied . No , I was glad to help my husband . And we had a happy home as well . " Her tone was gently defensive and self-satisfied . " We can make no fixed rules , after all ; it depends always on what the husband wishes , " said Frau Hutten . " For me , I lived only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like in that wild foreign country , we are all going home at last . But it can not be the same , " she told Frau Rittersdorf . " Nothing can be the same . We went out to Mexico in 1912 , foreseeing nothing of the disaster that was to overtake our belovedcountry . Fortunately , the Professor has very poor eyesight , and has suffered since youth with fallen arches : there was never any questionof his going to war  --  " " Fortunately ? " echoed Frau Rittersdorf , her arched eyebrows rising . " Fortunately , my husband was a magnificent , a perfect physical specimenof a man , a Captain , who saw three years ' service at the front , in the very thick , I may say , of the battle . He received the Iron Cross for his displays of superhuman courage in action , and he was killed on the field .... Is it not strange that war should destroy such men , the brave , the noble-minded , the sound in body , the invaluable fathers , and leave only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have asked myself that question many times in these years since I have been alone , and I can find no answer ! " " The world needs scholars and thinkers as well as soldiers , " said Fraup157Hutten , mildly . She was proof against this argument , being the sort of woman who admired intellectual attainments and bowed eagerly to moral superiority . " But I quite understand your feelings in the mat-ter . " " My husband , " said Frau Schmitt , " was a brave soldier , and a fine scholar , at once . These qualities are not incompatible . My husband ... " She stopped , drawing a long breath , which fetched up tears on its return as a pump from a well . Her face quivering , she felt blindly for her handkerchief . " No better than a dead man all those years , " she said , choking , " a dead man all those years . " The two women observed her display of feeling with composure and perhaps ' a slight tinge of satisfaction . Women must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles , in her own time . Tearless themselves at the moment , their faces wore also a faint expression of disapproval . Frau Schmitt appeared to be making rather a parade of grief , yet they could not help seeing with some adverse criticism that , in spite of her widow 's crape , she wore a heavy gold necklace with a large locket  --  inappropriate , to say the least . Frau Schmitt saw their glances wanderingaround her neck and throat , and being another woman , guessed their thought . She put her hand over the locket : " My husband 's portrait , " she said . " I have worn it so long , I can not be without it ! " In a rather prolonged silence not without edges , Frau Schmitt rose , her small nose and eyelids scarlet . " Excuse me , " she said . Balancing herself on her blunt-toed pumps , she edged around them and proceeded uncertainly towards the door . She paused there and stood aside for the sick old man in the wheel chair . Above the yellowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovered , and rudely he attempted to crowd his way through the door , almost beforeFrau Schmitt could get out of his path . " Stop , " said the sick man , in a hollow voice , holding up his hand , taking hold of Frau Schmitt 's sleeve with finger and thumb . She trembledand dared not move , as if a ghost had laid a hand upon her . " Are you in pain , my child ? " he asked her . " Let me help you . Come , walk beside me and tell me your trouble . " " Oh , no , no , " whispered Frau Schmitt hurriedly . " It is nothing . Thank you , thank you so much . You are very kind . " " It is God who is kind through me , his instrument , his servant , " said the sick man . " I , Wilibald Graf , can heal your sorrows by His grace if only you will believe . . . "  | " Uncle , " said the boy , hoarse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shoved the chair forward violently , and Herr Graf 's fingers still clinging slipped from Frau Schmitt 's sleeve . " Oh no , " she said , hurrying by , her body clumsy in flight , " thank you ! " The shock of his blasphemous proposal dried her tears , her grief made way for a sound religious indignation , and a few minutes later she was talking to the Baumgartners , who had been sitting in a doleful family isolation in the main salon . Herr Baumgartner was making his daily brief losing fight against his longing for a brandy and soda before his dinner , and his wife was waiting stonily for the moment when he should admit defeat . Hans was kneeling on a chair at the window , watching the sea and waiting for his glass of raspberry juice . His mother would then sit between him and his father , her head on her hand , and she would not let either of them out of her sight for a minute if she could help it . Hans wriggled and sighed , seeing Ric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaning far out over the water , shouting to each other , wild and free . They saw him and put out their tongues at him . Rac turned her back , flipped up her skirts and showed him the seat of her pants . He shrank down a little at this , behind the upholstered chair , shocked but not unpleasantly . He had never seen a girl do that before . Frau Schmitt said to Frau Baumgartner , " Imagine a man on the edge of the grave . . . " and Frau Baumgartner mentioned , almost shyly , that she had herself known persons , not always in the best of health themselves , who had the power of healing . Indeed , it had sometimes seemed it was their own health they gave away to others , so that they had none left for themselves . Frau Schmitt shook her head . " His face is not good . He frightened me with the look in his eyes . " Herr Baumgartner frowned with pain , groaned softly , and said , " There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body as well as the soul . " " He is a Lutheran , " said Frau Schmitt , impulsively , " how could he be a saint ? " Frau Baumgartner stiffened slightly , her tone and manner thoroughly chilled . " We are Lutherans , " she said . " We have our saints also . " " Oh dear , " said Frau Schmitt , " please believe me when I say I would never willingly offend the religious feeling of anyone  --  oh , to me , that is an unpardonable thing ! I am sure I did not make myself clear ... "  | " I am afraid you did make yourself very clear indeed , " said Frau Baumgartner , not ceding an eyelash . " There are saints in every church . But I suppose you Catholics think that nobody exists in God 's sight but yourselves  --  I suppose you could not admit that I am as much God 's child as you are . . . " " Oh please , Frau Baumgartner , " cried little Frau Schmitt , who by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are all God 's dear children together , and I have never dreamed of anything else . When I said you had no saints in your church , it was my ignorance  --  I did not know you had saints , nobody ever told me ! I thought only the Catholic church had saints  --  forgive me ! " She held out her hands wrung together . " Who are they ? " ' Who are what ? " asked Frau Baumgartner , distracted by the expression on her husband 's face which meant he was going to order a brandy and soda . " Your saints ? " asked Frau Schmitt , eager to learn . " Oh good heavens what a question , " said Frau Baumgartner , firmly putting an end to the scene . " I never discuss religion with anyone . Come Hans , " she called to her son , " we are going to have raspberry juice . " With averted face she snubbed Frau Schmitt finally and forever , and left her sitting there feeling deeply , unjustly injured . Even with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your heart , Frau Schmitt felt again for the thousandth time , how difficult it is to be good , innocent , friendly , simple , in a world where no one seems to understand or sympathize with another ; it seemed all too often that no one really wished even to try to be a little charitable . Captain Thiele , in his talk with Herr Professor Hutten and Dr. Schumann , mentioned the trouble in the steerage that morning . He remarked in the easy tone of one whose authority is not to be disputed , if there was any more disturbance among that riffraff , for any cause , he would lay the troublemakers in irons for the rest of the voyage . He loved to see his small brig occupied , and it was now standing empty . Dr. Schumann mentioned he had been told that one man had a broken nose , another a cut chin . On going down to see for himself , he had found them both getting on very well ; he had put court plaster on the nose and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iutten was pained to hear that the fight had been about religion . " Religion ? " said the Captain haughtily . ' What do they know aboutp160that ? " And they dismissed the matter . But Professor Hutten thought it interesting enough to mention to his wife and Frau Rittersdorf . Meeting Arne Hansen on deck , Frau Rittersdorf made bold to ask him if he had heard any further details about the riot in the steerage . Hansen , being barely awake , had heard nothing , but he asked a sailor in passing , and the sailor told him it had been a pretty good fight , though short . He had missed it , but he heard they drew knives . Frau Hutten , airing Bebe , fell in with the Lutz family , and in some agitation told them what she had heard from her husband , what she believed she had heard , and the Lutzes got the impression there had been a full-scale free-for-all scrimmage among dangerous criminals lurking below , with much bloodshed . Herr Lutz asked Herr Glocken , who was walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he had heard of the battle in the steerage , adding his hope that their grievances might be settled to their satisfaction . " Or they 'll be up here cutting all our throats , " he said , only meaning it halfway . Frau Lutz turned pale at such scandalous levity , and added as her personal opinion that it was probably a food riot : " Our own is not improving , you may have noticed , " she remarked . Herr Glocken was pleased to find Wilhelm Freytag knew nothing of the disturbance . " Odd , " Freytag said , " I saw Dr. Schumann just a few minutes ago , and he said nothing of such a thing . " But he took the cheerful view . " So they are fighting down there already ? Good , " he said , " good . What about ? " Herr Glocken did not know . Opinion was divided . People drifted into the bar . Arne Hansen 's booming intolerant voice could be heard in English saying bitterly to the company assembled in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all starving , in rags , shipped like cattle only not with such good care , can you guess what they find to fight about ? Religion . My God . They give each other bloody noses becauseone man kneels and another does not . " " Maybe religion is the only subject on which they have opinions , " said Mrs. Treadwell , gently whirling her stein of beer to make the foam rise again . " Ach , " said the purser , next to her , in distress , " please do n't whirl your beer . You will spoil it . " " Sorry , " said Mrs. Treadwell , smiling at him and setting down her stein . Hansen leaned forward , his pale eyes glaring under his knottedp161brows . " Opinions ? What opinions ? What do they know to have opinionsabout ? Only the fat man has opinions and the Captain says he is to be put in irons . . . so much for the right to opinions among those people . " " I beg your pardon , sir , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fat man makes more trouble he will  --  " " And who is to judge what is trouble ? " bawled Hansen . " Why , the Captain , of course , " said the purser , readily but a little uneasily as if he were dealing with a lunatic . Hansen nodded his head . " Just so , " he agreed , sourly . " How could anyone have an honest opinion about religion ? " intervenedDavid , and Jenny noticed that he spoke with a slight Spanish accent , one of his more irritating habits : pure affectation , she called it , though David denied it bitterly and claimed it was the natural result of speaking Spanish almost constantly for eight years . " All the claims are just prejudice against prejudice ; blind feeling fighting for the upper hand . . . . People love the right to hate each other with moral sanction . The real basis of the religious question is political  --  " " Just so , " boomed Hansen . " All is politics , who said otherwise ? Who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion was not part of politics ? Who will go to jail in this case ? The man who is against religion . Why ? Not because he does not like the Church , but because his acts disturb the government . The Church and the government are like that ! " Hansen held up two fingers pressed together . " He could knock down altars all day and who would care ? Nobody , if it was only a question of religion . " He turned his frown upon Freytag as to someonehe knew . " Is n't that so ? " Freytag said in a calm reasoning voice : " Perhaps the man whose altar was knocked down might fight for pure religious reasons . His act might be useful to a political party , but his own feelings need n't have any political meaning at all . . . . I do n't suppose either of those fellows could give a reasonable explanation of why they hit each other , but on one side at least I like to think it was something better than politics . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to herself , and hid her pleasedface behind her tilted stein . ) " Better ? " asked Hansen , and his heavy voice took on reproach and grief . " You think it is better for religion to make dupes of those poor people so that they fight each other instead of fighting their enemies together ? "  |p162His  sorrow and indignation were real , but their origins so mysterious to his listeners no one could answer him . The purser only clicked his tongue against his teeth several times and wagged a finger at him , shaking his big head with paternal gravity . Hansen ignored him . Herr Baumgartner spoke up from his table in a voice of deep emotion . " I am a lost soul , perhaps , " he said , " but never would I deny the power of true religion . It is the spiritual source of our civilization , our one hope in eternity . Poor as we may be now , what would we be without it ? " Hansen swung around and glared at Herr Baumgartner under his pale eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all true , " spoke up Herr Baumgartner , stoutly . " Oh , " said his wife in a tiny prolonged scream , " how can you say such a thing ? " Herr Hansen paid no attention to Frau Baumgartner . " Civilization , " he said , with blunt contempt , " let me tell you what it is . First the soldier , then the merchant , then the priest , then the lawyer . The merchanthires the soldier and priest to conquer the country for him . First the soldier , he is a murderer ; then the priest , he is a liar ; then the merchant , he is a thief ; and they all bring in the lawyer to make their laws and defend their deeds , and there you have your civilization ! " Herr Baumgartner flinched and closed his eyes and seemed about to reply ; his wife set her lips and nudged him with her toe ; he remained silent . " What about the artist ? " asked Jenny , egging him on . " What about him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is not , he is a fake , " said Hansen simply , without looking at her . Denny , sitting next to Lowenthal , who kept saying under his breath " Bolshevik , Bolshevik ! , " had been very gloomy during this exposition of Hansen 's views . He now burst into a loud laugh . Nobody laughed with him . He lapsed into red-faced confusion . " Fakes , ha , that 's right , " he said , at random . " Fakes ! " " I 'd like to see what is really going on , " said Jenny to Freytag , who had been watching her face . " I think if the fat man is in the brig we ought to picket the Captain and carry banners and make a big day of it ... " Freytag followed her , and they watched the people in the steerage for a while , but nothing was happening beyond the ordinary . Menp163lolled and played cards on the deck , the women nursed their babies or did their washing , the hot sunlight poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the other end of the ship , they found the Lutz family , the Huttens , the Cuban students , and Herr Glocken in a row looking down into the pit , where the canvas covering had been removed from the grating to give light and air to the quarters where the steerage passengersate . The first table was already spread , a reassuring sight . Thick as flies the people were clustered around huge slabs of boiled ox-brisket , dumplings , bowls of cooked apricots , piles of fresh green onions . They fed in devoted silence , reaching out long arms for the chunks of bread scattered along the white oilcloth . They leaned on their elbows and ate , feeling their strength return , feeling their blood and bones renewingthemselves , their hopes coming back , their desire to live rousing once more . The six students lined up and shouted something friendly and barbarous in their unfathomable argot ; several of the men turned their faces upward , mouths full , cheeks bulging , and jerked a hand at them , good-naturedly . They were sunken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired men who had at last slept and eaten . The sight-seers moved on , a little bored with relief , their eased minds reflected in their slightly vacuous expressions . Murmuring among themselves like pigeons , the Lutzes and the Huttens and Herr Glocken seemed to be vaguely agreed that to mistreat the poor is not right , and they would be the first to say so , at any time . Therefore they were happy to be spared this unpleasant duty , to have their anxieties allayed , their charitable feelings soothed . Those strange foreign people did not appearto be dangerous ; they were obviously not being mistreated at all ; on the contrary they were enjoying an excellent dinner ; and if there were mischief-makers down there , no one need worry  --  the Captain would know how to quell them . Jenny and Freytag lingered , some distance apart , then moved closer and stood together , their hands almost touching on the rail . Last night 's absurd scene was between them , and David Scott might again appear at any moment behind them , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt , or guilty intentions at least . Freytag 's belief in his own innocence took the form of an obscureresentment against Jenny : why did she allow that fellow to carry on like a cad , when he so obviously had no rights over her except suchp164as she chose to allow ? Freytag in the depths of his mind believed instinctivelyin legal rights only ; marriage tacitly gave to a man the legal right to abuse his wife up to a certain point , and Freytag took rather for granted that the wife had consented to this state of affairs when she took the marriage vow . All this was fermenting in his brain shapelessly , but he was clear about one thing  --  a woman who allowed a man to mistreat her when he had no legal right to do so was a fool , or worse . His feeling about Jenny , such as it was , lowered and cooled within a few seconds . Could she be in love with that fellow ? It seemed most improbable . Jenny , leaning far over , searched among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there he is , " she said , pointing out the fat man , who had changed to a grass-green shirt , " eating away . Not in the brig at all . So our parade is off , what a pity ! No injustice has been done , is n't that a shame ? " Her manner was entirely candid , her eyes very clear and gay . " There is injustice , all right , " said Freytag , " but it lies far back and deep down , it is in our grain , incurable  --  look , " he said earnestly , " if there were not injustice how could we even have the idea of justice ? An old lecturer I knew as a boy used to say , We right Wrong , and wrong Right . ' It would n't have done any good to picket the Cap-tain . " " Oh , would n't it ? " cried Jenny . She disagreed with him altogether . She thought he was just sitting down and letting things run over him . Nothing was incurable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the root you would never get anywhere . The top surface was quite enough to keep anyone busy ! If you wanted things changed  --  always for the better , of course !  --  you just kicked over the nearest applecart , spilled the first available bag of beans . She believed warmly and excitedly in strikes , she had been in many of them , they worked ; there was nothing more exciting and wonderful than to feel yourself a part of something that worked towards straightening out things  --  getting decent pay for people , good working conditions , shorter hours  --  it did n't much matter what . She had picketed dozens of times with just any strikers who happened to need pickets , and she had been in jail several times , and really , it was just a lark ! She did n't stay long , anyway . Somebody always came from a mysterious Headquarters with plenty of money , so it was out on bail for everybody and back to the line . She had never held with those hotheads who advised her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard gruesome stories of police brutalities to working women , really on strike , on the picket line and in jail , and knowing what she did about people , she could believe it . But she was glad to say she had got along very amiably with her policemen , all of them . She always made conversationand tried to convert them on the way to the station , and they were always quite polite , or at least decent , and impervious . They also knew what they knew and what they believed , and if this picketing stuff was n't against the law , it ought to be . " And yet , " she said , " some of them were quite nice ! " She might have been a young girl talking about the gay parties of her debutante season . Freytag could not take her seriously . She did not say where or when these things happened , nor precisely how she had happened to be mixed up in them  --  where had an apparently wellbrought-upyoung girl run into such company ?  --  nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her light running talk was full of omissions and pauses which she seemed to expect him to fill in from his own experience of such events . He knew nothing whatever about them except from a distance : he had seen police breaking up picket lines beforecigarette factories in Mexico and had approved of it thoroughly , waiting until the sidewalk was cleared before going about his own business . He listened , then , not for what she was saying , for it sounded like childish nonsense , or was repellently hard and careless , he could not decide which ; but she was full of feminine gentleness in her little person , harmoniously modeled and sweetly rounded . He realized with acute dismay that she seemed beautiful to him , and he remembered well that on first sight she had certainly struck him as nothing out of the ordinary . He shuddered . Out of his past , out of his restless , seekingsentimental youth before he knew Mary , there rose disturbingly a half dozen faces , dimmed , almost forgotten ; none of them beautiful before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them hatefuleven , but each one unbelievably enchanting for that brief time when he was hot after each in turn , bedeviled and blinded with illusion . It was always true love and it was always going to last forever . . . . He moved away from her abruptly and , frowning a little , leaned on his folded arms and let his eyes rest on the people below . They were milling about , replacing each other at the tables ; great heaps of dirtyp166plates were being taken away , the platters of hot food were again being thumped down on the oilcloth . Jenny 's face was a little dulled with melancholy ; rather suddenly her mood changed for no reason that Freytagcould surmise . Amparo and Pepe , with sulky morning faces , paused for a glance into the pit , another glance of calculated insolence at Jenny and Freytag , and passed on , their narrow , highly specialized behindsswaying gracefully . " Was n't Hansen funny in the bar just now , with his poor crooked mind trying to straighten out the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad after making love . " " Except women and mares , " said Freytag . " I do n't know about mares , " said Jenny , " but it seems to make Hansen angry . " " He 's an extreme character , " said Freytag . " Something is troubling him . He groans and yells and thrashes about at night and gets into fearful scrimmages with some enemy who attacks him in that upper berth . " " A political enemy , no doubt , " said Jenny . She enjoyed Freytag 's good looks , he was a delight to her eyes . She liked his harmless dandyism ; every man she had ever liked except David had been beautiful and vain as the devil . It had been her ruin , she decided , this weakness for handsome men . If a man were sufficiently good-looking she granted him all desirable qualities without hesitation . Freytag was almost too conventionally handsome to draw  --  David had a much more interesting face , really . Or had he ? A clinical expression dawned in her eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you looking at ? " asked Freytag uneasily , and barely restrained himself from running his hand over his hair , twitching at his necktie . he was not the first man so affected by Jenny 's intent but not flattering stare . " At your head , I like your head , " said Jenny . " I wish I could see the brains ... " " Oh God , what an idea ! " " The brain is most beautifully designed , " said Jenny loftily . " Maybe you would let me try to make some drawings of you ? " It might mean a few pleasant hours sitting about on deck ; she 'd like to see David try to make a scene about that . " Of course , I would , " said Freytag , " but  --  " " Nothing would happen , " she said , cheerfully . Then she took thep167plunge . " I do n't understand David at all , " she told him . " I never pretended to , and he is always surprising me by some new glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there is a certain kind of truth in drunkenness . I know that what I do and say when I am drunk is just as true as the other different things I do and say when I am sober . It 's just another side of me coming up for air ! " " Do you get drunk ? " asked Freytag . " Amazing . You seem a very sober person to me . " " I am sober , even when I 'm drunk , " she said , anxiously . " It 's always by accident and just for fun . But I am apt to say things I 'd have sense enough to hide at other times . And I know David does the same thing . . . " David gives himself away badly , she thought . That is what I am sayingnow , cold sober . The next step is to apologize for him . Explain that he really is not that sort of man  --  or not often . That is not at all the kind of thing he usually does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what you have seen of him . He 's had a terrible kind of life and has to work harder than most people to keep his balance . You must know him pretty well before you can see his true qualities clearly . I do know him well and when I say I do n't understand him it 's because I am ashamed for him and for me about what happened last night . It was the least important part of David who did that . I know a great deal more about him , I know some lovely things ,  --  I love him . Shameful , shameful . The next step would be to break out with what was really hurting her ; about that terrible dream last night that just left her nowhere to go but out and away . . . " When you are in love , " she said aloud above the chattering of her thoughts , " it is nearly impossible to make yourself see straight , is n't it ? " " I 'm not sure I can agree with that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving the word just so much weight and no more . The nape of her neck was very white and exposed-looking as she turned away her head , but she listened attentively when he talked about love , boasting a little , perhaps . He told her , as if not making much of a point of it , that he believed love was based on faith , complete loyalty its first attribute . Far from being blind , real love helped one to see clearly perhaps for the first time . Any smallest betrayal of the loved one , whether the act came early or late , was total betrayal from the first , and it destroyed not only the future but the very past itself , for every day lived in confidencep168had been a lie and the heart a dupe . To be unfaithful even once was never to have been faithful at all .. . " No , " said Jenny , " to be unfaithful once is to be unfaithful once , and you can be repentant and get back in the fold just like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , clearly but without boldness , " who always said he never realized how much he loved me except when he was being unfaithful to me . There 's a flaw in that doctrine , " she said , beginning to laugh rather sharply , " but I was never able to convince him . " Freytag laughed with her , and agreed that men 's techniques of havingit both ways had a comic side . Then he went on quietly as if he were talking to himself : Love , he said , was a benevolent passion , full of patient kindness and fostering tenderness , faithful not by choice nor design but by nature , hardy and lasting , full of courage . Flowers crept into his sentences , life , death , even eternity , were mentioned : bread and wine , and the perpetual recurrence of hopeful mornings with no evil memories and no remorses . Jenny listened as if hypnotized . The dreamy voice was soothing as a cradlesong , a song her own wishful deluded heart sang to itself . It mingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh wind on her face . She heard a strange voice , now with the faintest trace of a German inflection in it , echoing not what she knew in her bitter mind , but her feelings ; it seemed sick and sentimental and false . At the last word her eyes flared open , and she cut through his maunderings . " I think it is a booby trap , " she said , with a violence that made her shake all over . " I hate it and I always did . It makes such filthy liars of everybody . But I keep falling into it just the same . " " With all the wrong people , " he said , flatly , but in a covert tone of triumph which annoyed her at once , " and what you fall into is n't love . " " I know , I know , " said Jenny , intolerantly , " it 's only Sex , you 'll be telling me next . How do you ' manage to keep True Love and Sex sep-arated ? " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised and indignant , " I do n't at all , of course not . It never occurred to me that it was possible ! " " I do n't know what I fall into , then , " said Jenny , and her face was pale , woebegone , no sparkle or warmth at all , " only that it comes to no good and it could be love . " The word fell softly between them and chimed in them both.  | " It might be , " agreed Freytag gently after a moment . " Maybe we get the kind of love we are looking for . " Jenny turned on him in a blaze . " Stop tying everything up in your neat little bowknots ! " she said vehemently . " That 's just a way of sidesteppingyour own responsibility for the trouble you cause somebody else . She asked for it , ' you can always say , I only gave her what she wanted ! ' . . . that 's just moral imbecility and you know it ! " " Oh come now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name for the first time , quite sure of her feeling for him by now , " you 're talking nonsense . I wo n't listen to it . We have no quarrel , none at all . Ca n't we be friends , ca n't we be loyal good friends and talk things over sensibly ? Is n't there something besides love ? " Oh God , thought Jenny , that 's the next gambit . " Oh yes , of course , and much better as a rule , " she said , in order to end the talk , and they stood together in a baffled silence . As for loyalty , thought Jenny , you should n't be talking about love to a strange woman on shipboard , nor I to a strange man . It 's the narrow end of the wedge . Your wife would hate it and so would David , and they 'd be quite right . That 's one thing about David . He 'll never be mooning around about love to any other woman . He wo n't even talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , even . You 've got a roving eye and the sidelong approach . If you belonged to me I would n't trust you any further than I could throw you by the ear . I can always trust David . David is going to be mean and tough and stubborn and faithful to death . We are n't going to kill each other because I mean to get away before that happens . But we 'll leave dents in each other . When I get through with David , he 'll know the difference between me and the next woman , and I 'll be carrying David like a petrifiedfetus for the rest of my life . She felt empty and sick and tired enough to lie down . " Love , " she remarked , wrinkling her nose , " this ship is simmering with it . I 'm sure it 's all Real Love . I must fly , " she said , " Elsa 's in love , too , and I promised to help her fix her hair in a new way . " Alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of it ; she was rather plainly laughing at him more than once . No doubt she thought him a touch soft-headed . But she would live to learn better . She might have been lovely before she was maimed and perverted by her disordered life , her false notions of love and reckless waste of her womanly substance . He had known girls like her before , in severalp170countries  --  wild and confused and lonely , full of mistrust , letting him come nearer with a wary look in their eyes as if they would dash away if he tried to touch them . Their waywardness , homelessness , and lack of scruples had freed him from any sense of obligation to them , they asked nothing of him , and had left him at last free to enjoy a rememberingpity and tenderness for them . But that was all in the past . Such follies as Jenny promised to be belonged to his other life , that life peopled with phantoms and foolish dreams ; he knew what they were worth , compared to the solid reality of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most singlehearted and faithful of men , he had needed only to find his Mary , his love , and he had found her . Now , he had been separated from her for nearly three months , and his flesh was uneasy , desirous ; he was sleeping as badly as when he was a bachelor , spending far too much time and energy trying to find relief from sex : and accepting too often , he remembered with a chill , some pretty sad versions of it . It was a very bad sign when he began feeling sentimental about the first possibly available woman not a professional whore , at least , who crossed his path in an unlucky moment . What was he thinking about ? He brought himself up short ; a slight uncomfortable twinge  --  could it be guilt ?  --  went over him , almost a tremor of the nerves . This tremor of guilt and the beginning of sexual uproar were hardly to be told apart : his preoccupation shifted without warning from Jenny to one of those available Spanish dancers  --  Lola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something good and dirty and hot  --  that would do . He gripped the rail and stood there holding himself together resolutely , and trying to get his impulses under control again . The first sign of returning sanity was that he damned Jenny freely for a teasing bitch : invoked the name of his wife fervently and made up his mind to write her a long letter after dinner , and to read all her sweet , passionate , wifely letters again before sleeping . The Cuban medical students on their way to Montpellier had become more than ever a hermetic society , with ritual greetings , secret handgrips which when applied properly wrung responsive yells of facetious anguish from the initiates , and a jargon so recondite they referred constantly in speech to small typewritten code sheets . They engaged in what appeared to be long , learned debates , carried on withp171farcical solemnity always where they might be seen , but in such loweredtones their rather bored audiences were in no danger of sharing their secrets . It became known however that they called themselves " Les Camelots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship 's press every morningcopies of a miniature newspaper bearing in highly visible type the banner El Pi-pi Diario . Midmorning they were often seen going into La Condesa 's stateroom , and coming out being a little boisterous among themselves later ; and one day in the small writing room off the bar , they held a meeting and elected La Condesa president , or CockroachExtraordinary . Dr. Schumann , who was sitting outside the window , could not have helped overhearing and in fact had not tried to avoid it ; and he was outraged to hear in what lewd and disrespectful terms the students talked about her . They believed her to be insane , that was clear , and the designated object of their monkeyish ridicule , but why they chose to expend their boyish filth upon her the Doctor could not understand . Above all , she was not a fool , hut a woman of the world and wise in it , and why would she let herself be made a figure of fun by these particularly crass young men ? Upon her appearance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Condesa seemed to have all confidence in her young admirers , and enjoyed their company . They rose as one , bowed deeply , and escorted her to their own table . Her chair was brought , and she sat among them with her elegant manner and , Dr. Schumann thought , a slightly distracted smile . He continued to watch her while she read their no doubt dreadful little newspaper , and she laughed most unbecomingly , showing gold teeth in the back . Taking first the student on her right , and then the one on her left , by the head with both hands , she whispered things in their ears that set them off with shouts of applause and eager questions from the others . Her hands then flew to her own breasts and she stroked them up and down , her face pained and thoughtful . No doubt she had reserved for herself a third flask of ether , and perhaps a fourth , Dr. Schumann concluded with resignation , and a great temptation to give her up , to make no further attempts to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nobility were of astronomical heights , viewed with pinched mouth and beady eyesp172the frivolous conduct of his distinguished prisoner . She glanced his way , fluttered her fingers at him and at Dr. Schumann , both of whom returned the salute gravely . Captain Thiele was suffering from indigestion brought on by frus tration of his natural sense of authority , to say nothing of his official rank . Upon hearing of the disturbance in the steerage his first impulse had been to order all the participants instantly confined for the rest of the voyage . He had received the deported workers as so many head of cattle , and to find them at the very beginning of the voyage daring to assert themselves with outright insolence was not to be endured for a moment . Father Carillo had talked to him , in abominable German , as if the fight were not merely a low brawl ; he mentioned several times such terms as syndicalism , anarchism , republicanism , communism , besides atheism , above all atheism , the common root of such pernicious theories ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all subjects existing among the rabble on the lower deck . Accordingto Father Carillo , the lower classes were being led astray by a thousand evil influences from every direction , and a great many dangeroussubversive elements were on the steerage deck . These should be watched carefully , not only for the sake of the first-class passengers , the crew , the ship herself , but for the protection of the innocent poor below , those good and harmless people who wished only to he allowed to obey the law and to practice their religion in peace . The Tenerifans , for example , were mostly decent pious folk . The trouble would be found among the Asturians and the Andalusians , between whom there existed old enmities at best , and he , Father Carillo , was not surprised to discover that the antireligious faction consistedalmost entirely of Asturians , with a sprinkling of Basques . .. . They were then the ones to watch . As for the fat man who had pushed the man still kneeling in prayer , he was of the lowest order of rabble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to Spain for the sole purpose of making trouble there and linking Mexican labor uprisings with those of Spain . No use to worry with him  --  he would be arrested the moment he set foot on Spanish soil . The Captain found himself divided into many sections : he loathed Catholics on principle ( he believed that priests without exception took advantage of the privacy of the confessional to seduce their more attractive female penitents ) , he was violently prejudiced against Span/iards as well as Mexicans , and he felt it was beneath his dignity to take the advice of a priest , as well as to admit any human meaning or importance in the doings of the rabble in the steerage . He thanked Father Carillo stiffly for his information , promised to order a general tighteningof discipline , using his favorite phrase about laying in irons the next offenders against the peace , and very shortly after that his breakfastbegan to disagree with him . His real trouble was , in the heavily overcrowded condition of the ship , there was no place to confine malcontents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Father Carillo seemed to think . In case of outright revolt , it was possible the crew would not be sufficient to control them . Suppose they should seize such small arms as were in the hold , what then ? The Captain , who had spent his professional career , except for the interval of the war , in the relative calm of merchant passenger ships , small ones on long dull cruises , had a riotous , violent imagination which now took possession of him . He dreamed for a brief moment of a cinematic crisis full of darkness , hand-to-hand struggle , flashes of light and thunderous explosions , broken heads and mangled limbs and pools of blood , screams and yells and incendiary flames lighting the sky , with lifeboats being lowered away into the heaving sea , himself still on the bridge somehow in full command of the situation , and completely calm . Before actually leaving the bridge , however , in the present broad light of a peaceful day , he issued a hasty order that every man in the steerage  --  woman too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons however insignificant , and all were to be confiscated for the duration of the voyage . This done , he felt somewhat restored , and in spite of his gas pains was able to speak of the morning 's incident with becoming casualness to Herr Professor Hutten and Dr. Schumann . They had disappointed him by accepting his manner at its face value , and seemed to think the incident of very little importance . The Captain 's mood of disapprobation drifted from La Condesa . She was after all not to be blamed so much , since she was a lady in frail health and in a situation highly unsuitable to her caste ; however , her very presence on board in such circumstances was a serious symptom of the disorder abroad in the world . Dimly her conduct reflected upon his authority as much as the impudent brawling among the steerage passengers . He was not thinking only of himself  --  a deviation fromp174routine , a threat to his established rule , every moment of every day within the range of his orders , was not merely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , he fulfilled his destiny in his appointed place as representative of the higher law ; if he failed in his duty  --  and the very foundation of his duty was to exact implicit obedience from every soul on the ship , without exception  --  why , then the whole structure of society founded on Divine Law would be weakenedby so much . He could not face such a moral catastrophe , and lie need not . He would not . He gazed fretfully , his underlip pouted , at the irritatingly complacentfaces gathered around his board . Herr Freytag  --  who was he ? A man who looked upon a ship as a public conveyance meant only to get him in safety and comfort from one port to another . Herr Rieber , the same . Herr Professor Hutten was a man of learning , but what could a professor know of the stern realities of the sea ? In spite of his profoundrespect for Dr. Schumann , he had felt more than once that the Doctor had no real understanding of the discipline necessary on a ship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him more than once , tactfully , against coddling the sailors when they were in sick bay as if they were his patients at home . There were even times when the Doctor seemed to be enjoying himself , quite as if he were merely on a voyage for his own health . It was true , except for his heart he would never have shipped as doctor , but still : when he returned from the steerage that morning , the Doctor had almost ignored the disturbance at the end of Mass , but had mentioned that during the night two women had babies on the bare deck , and he had arranged for them to have bunks in the same cabin for three or four days at least . It showed a lack of proportion in his mind somewhere , the Captain concluded , an indifference to truly serious things . Of the women the Captain expected nothing , but their low-voiced babble among themselves annoyed him . Little Frau Schmitt was leaningover and talking across Herr Rieber to Fraulein Lizzi , while Frau Rittersdorf and Frau Hutten leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hutten was shaking her head sadly . The Captain pretended to attack his dinner , but he was hot with irritation and his vitals were stabbing him cruelly . Frau Schmitt 's grief had dried up somewhat after her experience with Herr Graf and her unlucky encounter with the Baumgartners ; she wandered out on deck and paused idly , as everyone did sooner orp175later during the day , to watch , as at the bars of a cage , the strange life going on in the steerage . She found herself near the reserved-looking young American , Herr David Scott , also leaning on his elbows with his collar hunched up around his ears . Her eyes were attracted to a sad sight . A man , very bony and ragged and worn , but perhaps young , it was hard to tell , his tousled hair on end , was sitting , back to the rail , his knees drawn up and his bare toes curling and uncurling with sorrow ; he was crying openly and bitterly like a child . He wept and scrubbed his eyes with his fists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at his feet were several small objects , Frau Schmitt could not quite make out what they were . The other people paid no attention to him ; they sat near him with stony indifferent faces ; men stood in groups over him with their backs turned , women almost stepped on him going about their own concerns . He seemed completely alone in the world ; there is nothing like trouble to divide the human heart from you , thought Frau Schmitt , her own heart swelling with tears once more , but this time with softer and gentler tears , because they were shed for another 's sorrow . She spoke gently to the listening women . " So I said to the young man , Oh , would n't you think at least some one of them would speak to him ? They might ask him what is the matter . The young American then said to me , They know already what is the matter ; why should they ask ? And then it seemed there had been an order , from whom I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took away their knives and such little edged tools as they had , and this poor man is a wood carver . " Frau Schmitt , deep in her story , raised her voice a little , forgetting her natural timidity in the interest she saw in the faces around her , and the Captain sat up sharply listening with a gathering frown which Prau Schmitt did not notice . ' Well , the Herr David Scott told me then this man was carving small animals from bits of wood he had brought in his bundle , hoping to sell them to people in first class . Herr Scott had half a dozen in his pocket , and he showed them to me : they were very pretty and childlike ; I Ierr Scott said , He is a fine artist . But you know how these Americans are  --  they worship primitive things because they can not understand better . They are corrupted by the Negro , of course  --  what can we expect ? I smiled at him and said nothing ; but the poor man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knife , he some/how thought he was lending it , imagine , and would be given it back in a few minutes . Think of that . The young man told me everything . 1 le had seen and heard . He was very angry in a cold pale way as if he had lost blood . Gone then for good were the hopes of that poor man , gone his happy occupation and his little knife , and so he cried , he cried like a baby . " Frau Schmitt 's sensibilities almost overcame her again . She sat back and put her napkin to her mouth . Frau Hutten clucked softly , deprecatingly . Lizzi said in a high infantilevoice , " Oh , I do n't think that was very nice , taking the poor little man 's property away from him ! Make them give it back , dear Captain , please ? " Her long arm flew forth and she struck him lightly on the sleeve with her fan . The Captain did not respond with the charmed gallantry she expected . His wattles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his collar , and he gave Frau Schmitt a truly awful glare . The perfect victim of his wrath had been delivered into his hands , and he proceeded to make an example of her . " I am exceedingly sorry , ladies , " he began , in a voice of blistering courtesy , and his glance took them all in : their unbalanced female emotions , their shallow , unteachable minds , their hopeless credulity , their natural propensity to rebellion against all efforts of men to bring order and to preserve rule in life . " Oh , very sorry indeed , ladies , to distressyour kind hearts , but let me confess that I myself gave the order for the disarming of the deportees . I wish I might trust you to believe me when I say that all my acts are governed by a knowledge of the true situation regardless of sentimental considerations . In the end I alone am answerable not only for your safety but for the very life of this ship ; therefore , please do allow me to advise you that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion , please , dear lady , " he added sternly to Frau Schmitt , " at least do us the favor not to listen to the gossip and prejudices of foreigners , who naturally are anxious to put the worst possible light on anything at all done by a German . Or if you must listen to such rubbish , above all do not repeat it to anyone ! " This unexpected climax to a trying morning crushed Frau Schmitt . She bowed her head , her shoulders drooped , a blush mounted painfully , slowly , from neck to forehead , her hands lay beside her plate and she seemed unable to lift them . From under her eyebrows she saw Fran Rittersdorf 's sweet , satisfied smile , yes , just like a cat 's . Frau Schmittp177was not comforted to know she would see that smile again in the cabin that evening , and for many days after . The ship 's band did not play in the morning , it being Sunday , but after dinner the elevating strains of Wagner and Schubert filled the salon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a word the more respectable element , settled down to the relaxation of cards , dominoes , and chess . La Condesa disappeared , and later the students could be heard shouting first at shuffleboard and then in the swimmingpool . Mingled with the strains of the band came a harsher music . The zarzuela company had brought a small gramophone on deck , and a sharp soprano was raised in urgent obsessive complaint , accompanied by the insinuating clack and whine of outlandish instruments . They danced together , clicking their heels and snapping their fingers resonantly , revolving about each other with the grace of birds in a matingdance , but with cold professional faces . They stopped the music for a few minutes , talked among themselves , and began again , watching each other sharply . Ric and Rac joined in , facing each other with narrowed eyes and bared teeth , their small thighbones strangely agitated . At intervals they stamped and screamed criticisms at each other without interrupting the rhythm of the dance , their faces almost touching . Their elders watched them without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the deck in a beautifully composed group , and Lola the star began a slow graceful intense dance . " Ole , ole , viva to madre ! " they cried in time to the music , clapping their hands with subtle variations of rhythm as Lola 's undulating skirts almost rose over their heads . The Cuban students came up out of the pool ; reluctantly most of the Germans left their games ; sailors appeared with the air of being there on duty ; all were drawn irresistibly to the charming scene . Freytag , finding himself standing beside Herr I lansen , said in real surprise , " Why , she 's a wonderful dancer ! " Herr I Jansen turned like a man brought out of a hypnotic trance . " Eh ? What 's that ? She 's great  --  she 's a great dancer . " Not quite that , perhaps , thought Freytag , moving on , still feeling a little ashamed of his recent flurry about Lola . He felt a touch of condescension towards a man so poverty-stricken he must fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of such an animal as Amparo.  |p178Lola  danced grandly and severely , her features fixed in the classic erotic-frowning smile , which fetched forth ritual amorous groans from the males of her assisting company . At her last roulade of clicking heels , the others sprang up . The rehearsal over , they danced in pairs as if for pleasure , but with no pleasure in their faces , and they ignored their audience with well-rehearsed contempt . Elsa , with her hair in a roll on top of her head , which Jenny had helped her to do and which made her look older , broader in the cheeks , averted her eyes suddenly and stepped backward as if she would hide behind her parents . Excited by the dancing , her face had fallen into a vacant , happy smile . Then alas she saw her student , with only black wool trunks concealing his nakedness , take one of the Spanishgirls about the waist and begin dancing with her . Elsa 's modestysuffered a shock which caused real pain at the very center of her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She closed her eyes and saw in fiery darkness what she refused to see by daylight  --  the flexing muscles of his back , the thin beautiful ribcage , the long slenderlegs with boyish bony knees , and worst of all , the long fine-muscled arms embracing that girl they called Concha , her body limp and yet in movement against his naked chest . No , she could not bear it . " Mama , " she whimpered , " Mama , please , let 's go inside . " " Are you sick , Elsa ? " asked her mother . " Is there anything wrong with you ? " " No , no , please , " said Elsa , in an oppressed , patient voice . " The sun is so hot . " " I give you until tomorrow , " said her mother firmly , " until tomorrow to be in better spirits , and then I shall give you a good purge . That is no doubt what you need . Here on this ship , with the lack of exercise , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , easily . A good purge , that is what you need . But now control yourself , and come finish the dominoes with your father . As to your hair , Elsa , I do n't like it so . This evening you must put it back in the old way . And never change it again without asking me . " " Yes , Mama , " she said , meekly , and sat down with her father again . Dominoes and checkers with her father , housework that she hated under the constant advice , direction and reproof of her Mama , never to be able to call even her hair her own , to be left on the shelf an old maid at last , yes , that would be her fate , she could feel it deep withinp179her . Her heart sank and then rose again in her and began to knock desperately against her ribs as if it were a prisoner beating against the bars , as if it were not part of her but a terrified stranger locked up in her , crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , noticing her forlorn face , pinched her cheek with tendernessand said jovially , " Maybe our Elsa is in love with somebody  --  maybe that big solemn Swede Hansen . No , Elsa , my treasure ? Tell your papa and mama . We know best . " Elsa said even more meekly , placing a double six after long hesitation , " No , no , Papa , not that . " Frau Lutz , glancing up from her knitting , saw for a moment framed in the doorway against the bright horizon a sight which caused her to frown warningly at her husband , indiscreet as he ever was , thoughtlessas usual . Arne Hansen was dancing with Amparo . She seemed to be instructing him in the mysteries of her native dances . They passed and repassed the doorway , Hansen following as awkwardly as a dancingbear , with Amparo treating him as if indeed he were that animal and she the trainer . She seemed to be scolding and laughing at him ; they would pause swaying and she would take him by the elbows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his big hands and feet getting in the way , his wet shirt sticking to his pink skin . He seemed like a man bewitched , utterly indifferent to the scandalous figure he presented to the eyes of the world . Frau Lutz , amazed at this instance of failure in her judgment of men , a subject in which she considered herself an expert , was pleased to note that her daughter 's back was turned towards this unedifying scene . She never ceased to worry , night and day , at the unbelievable hardships a mother encountered in her efforts to preserve the innocence of a daughter . Everywhere you turned , unsavory sights , immoral situations , disreputable characters , shameless behavior on the part even of those in whom you had some reason to place a little hope . Men ! Her gaze rested upon her husband with baleful intensity . He was talking his usual foolishness to Elsa , playing his game without a care , understanding no better than ever the deadly seriousness of life 's problems ; joking with Elsa about love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been unwise enough to depend upon him in anything for a moment ? Ah , she would find a very different kind of husband for Elsa , she had made up her mind to that.  |p180Johann  , pushing his uncle 's wheel chair , heard the Spanish music and went a little faster , then slowed down again as he came in sight of Lola , turning and clicking her heels . His sullen fair-skinned face , with its scanty blond stubbles of beard shining , lighted up so tenderlyhe looked for an instant like a young angel . He turned the chair to the rail and stopped to watch the delightful show . " Go on , Johann , " said his uncle , for the slight joggling of the chair soothed him , and the movement against the wind helped his breathing . His shriveled flesh and his very bones were old and tired and lonely ; they cried day and night for a little pity and ease and comfort . In the hospital in Mexico the nurses had rubbed him with sweet-smelling witch hazel all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his shriveled muscles ; they had fed him warm milk and cool fruit juices , papaya , pomegranate , lime ; he sucked them through a glass tube , half asleep as if he were a baby again . In the night when he groaned and called out , a Mexican nun in her white face bands and gauzy white veil would come and minister to him , and she would swing the mattress softly on its light springs as if it were a cradle , saying under her breath , " Ave Maria ... " Now in the miserable cabin , Johann touched him with loathing , he would hand him a dripping cold cloth and say viciously , " Wash your own dirty face . " He set down trays of coarse revolting food beside him and went away without giving him so much as a spoon for the soup . In the long nights , when he would be in pain to ease nature , he might call and call until his throat closed and the pain in his chest shot through him like fire before Johann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the helpless flesh was punishment enough , without that hard , unforgiving face above him , averted in loathing . " Johann , " he wanted to cry , " child of my hopes , what has become of you ? Where did you go ? Pity , a little pity , in God 's name . " But there was no pity in that child . I Iis soul was sicker than any flesh could be . Herr Graf trembled to think of its fate before God 's judgment . " Ca n't you see there is no room to pass ? " asked Johann , stubbornly lingering . " Let me alone a minute , ca n't you ? " " Turn back , then , Johann , " said I-Ierr Graf , calmly , " turn back . " The chair was whirled about so sharply he was thrown to one side . " Do n't try to kill me , Johann , " he said in an ominous voice . " My God has promised me that I shall see Germany again . Defy Him if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beggar , " Johann burst out in a fury . " Where is the allowance you promised me ? Why must I ask you for money even to go to the barber ? " " What would you do with money on this ship , Johann ? It would be only another temptation set in your way . I will provide the necessaries , nephew , but I will not nourish your lusts and appetites . Your soul is too precious to risk in such a way , Johann . I know too well what use you would make of money here . " He drew a long , rattling sigh , the bloody phlegm came up in his throat and he spat into his paper box . " That 's what you get for gabbing all the time , " said Johann , " you miserly old Jew . " Herr Graf looked at his hands , emaciated , the knuckles mere knobs , the fingers so weak and limp they lay flat or curved as they fell , and thought how not so long ago they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For such as he there was only one remedy  --  to mortify the flesh until the hard knot of the will was reached and dissolved  --  ah , a task he might have done so well , and would have so delighted in , the saving of this now ungovernable soul . But God , who was taking away his life little by little , meant for him to suffer all affliction , all possible abasement of mind and flesh to balance the great gift he had conferred upon his spirit . From the very moment he had learned that his body was beginning in earnest to die , like a stream of pure light the divine knowledge had descended upon him that , as recompense for his death , God had given him the power of healing others . In this power his soul had been eased of its fears . To his shame now he remembered that he once feared death , he had cringed abjectly as a condemned criminal at the sight of the ax , he had prayed endlessly and incoherently , begging God to reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send a miracle ; to punish him for his sins in any other way , no matter how cruel , but only to let him live , even as he was , in pain , in decay , in despair  --  to let him live . He , a philosopher and teacher of philosophy , lecturer in universitiesand before learned societies , had done this terrible thing . When ? In his other world , his other life . All his false wisdom had dropped away from him like soiled , outworn rags , he had stood naked as the newly born in the steady stream of cleansing light , and the softest most loving voice he had ever heard , he had not dreamed of such love in a voice , spoke within his ear . " Heal the sick , " the voice had said ,  |p182with  the simplicity and directness which is the language of true revelation . And from that day he had gone about his work , knowing the truth ; so long as he was able to keep upon his feet , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and heal them in God 's name . It had not been easy , for the perverse human wills of his family and friends had put every obstacle in his way . It seemed almost  --  and this was so dreadful a thought he hardly dared give it room in his brain  --  as if they bore some malice or evil intention toward the dying , as if they did not wish the sick to be healed and well again , like themselves . A friend of his sister 's , a willful woman , would not allow him to touch her little grandson who was suffering from bowel complaint . " He needs his rest , he must not be disturbed , " she said angrily , and the child had died . But he had saved his sister 's servant , an Indian woman who had been in labor for three days , until her eyes were mere pits in her face , and her lips were blackened and dry . " It is not decent for an Indian woman to let a man see her having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman would rather die ! " At last he had gone in boldly , pushing them aside , asserting a man 's authority over them , and they gave way before him as God meant them to . He had laid his hands upon the distorted suffering belly where the child kicked and heaved in his struggles to be born , called upon God to admit this new soul to life and to His heaven at last , and the child was born safely with three tremendous tearing pains in a very few minutes . He had breathed secretly into the mouth of an infant drowning with pneumonia , and from his own ruined lungs had poured life into the child 's . Oh , there were many : after he had been sent to the hospital , he had been forced to do good by stealth , for the doctors were bitterly jealous of his power , and hindered him by rules , forbidding him under pain to visit the dying in order to touch them and give them life again . But God guided him . He knew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the one who needed him most , and no one was afraid of him because he always said at once , " God bless you , and make you well , " and then he touched them lightly , just barely with the tips of his fingers , and was away before some prowling nurse or interne should discover him and put an end to his work . Rarely in the hospitaldid he have the joy of seeing his dear resurrected ones in health and strength  --  he was watched too closely , he could not risk a second visit . But there was one : the girl with the red hair in two braids lyingp183behind the death screen with eyes fixed upward , her face livid and mouth half-open , burning to his touch like living fire . " God will make you well , do you believe ? " he asked her , and from the scorched mouth scarcely moving he heard the words , " I believe . " Oh blessed child of faith . He had seen that girl , recognizable by her two long red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital with her happy family not a week later . " The doctors will think they did it , but we shall know the truth , " he had told her . These were his memories , and this his recompense , and what were his own sufferings but a divine grace since they had been made useful to others ? What was death ? Why had he been afraid ? There remained the greatest reward of all : immortality for the suffering bewildered soul . Immortality . It is not a matter of belief , what is there to believe ? How can anyone form even an idle wish around anything so infinitelyformless ? It is a matter of faith  --  no , a hope , a fixed changelesslonging for a continued existence in another place , under another appearance , in a different element ; continued existence at least until all questions are answered , and all unfinished things are done . Is it not fairly a certainty that this is a divine impulse sent from God to guide us to Him ? . . . And yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man 's present existence , an intellectual concept related to his animal instinct of self-preservation ; man loves himself so dearly he can not relinquish willingly one atom of himself to oblivion . Perhaps the whole idea then originates in the will , that source of self-love , and is simply one more of its various and deluded activities . And what about the four-footed beasts , the feathered , the finny ? Perhaps they have a corresponding source of vitality in them ; or better , they do not even suspect they shall not live forever precisely as they are . Ah , there 's happiness for you , there is the lucky state of being . Herr Graf opened his eyes with a leap of the nerves , thrilling with pain all through : he must have dozed and dreamed , there was some terrible nightmare at the edge of his memory . Weakness and despair almostoverwhelmed him . " Johann , Johann , " he muttered , his tongue thick , " water , water , " and then , " My God , my God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his lips . He did not dare to pray , he did not know what to pray for . The soul after death may discover , may wake in morning radiance , to a bliss it is now unable to imagine , and no matter how mysterious its longings now , it will understand everything then . Ah , maybe heaven itself is only this : that Wilibald Graf mayp184never once remember he was Wilibald Graf , miserable lost pilgrim in this terrible world . Is that what is meant , perhaps , by the blessed words " forgiveness of sins " ? " Water , water , Johann , my sweet child , " he said again , but there was no answer . He felt the slight swaying motion of the chair being wheeled again smoothly after a long pause . As they turned the corner the dark shadow of his nephew 's head and shoulders fell across his own , lay upon his knees and stretched before them upon the deck . The silence stretched too until it broke with the strain of its own hatred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false solicitude , mimicking the tone of kindness with elaborate cruelty . Gathering himself , he spat out his poison : " Well , wait until you get it , you stinking old corpse . " " Shame on you , Johann , " said his uncle calmly . " I leave you to God . " Without warning , in silence , Johann spun the chair around violently , guided it swiftly through the main salon , down the stairs and through the long passageway into their cabin with its bitter smells . At the door he simply gave the chair a shove through ; it rolled to the opposite wall and fetched up with a bump . Herr Graf had not protested , nor even turned his head . The chair slithered a little sideways , and in a flash of fearful hope Johann saw his closed eyes and dropped jaw like a newly dead man 's . Slamming the door behind him , he raced back to the deck , his stomach so sunken and tight between fury and terror , his heart pounding so heavily he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly blinded . Yet he could see Concha , not clearly , but enough . He halted then and moved to the rail and stared at her ; she stared back in perfect stillness , meaning with her look to motion him to her . He did not move , and with his hot , fixed eyes he resembled uncommonlya famished tiger regarding its prey , lips drawn back , teeth bared . Concha had seen this look often and had never been dismayed by it . On the contrary , it exhilarated her , lightened for her often her rather dull occupation , to find a young one full of fire and awkward eagerness . She was young too , the youngest of her company , not yet hardened altogether , and she was not at all deceived by this unhappy boy , standing there gazing at her like something lurking behind a bush , slouched over a little , hands in pockets , trying to carry it off , longing to be a man . Concha walked towards him smiling , and without hesitation held out her arms to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johanntook one bound towards her , seized her waist accurately at arm'sp185length , and strode away with her in the dance , still with the look of one caught between flood and fire . Concha put her nose to his chest inside his open shirt front and took a deep luxurious breath . He smelled like a clean baby , with rich undersmells of a real male . She took a good hold of him then ; her breast rose high under her thin shabby black dress , her neck arched ; she preened and strutted and murmured like a pigeon . Head back , eyes raised and shining , she smiled at him deeply , gave him a long heart-shaking look , then dropped softly against him the full length of her body , and rested her pale cheek on his chest as if she slept . Meanwhile , asleep or not , her neatly rolling little hips kept tireless rhythm , she stepped and swayed and spun in the perfection of her delicate art . Little by little Johann 's desperate face smoothed and softened , he rested his cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . A rather routine performance perhaps , Freytag was thinking . Consideringall the uproar it can cause , the instrument is strangely limited ; a mere reed flute with a few monotonous notes  --  but this girl does have style . She may teach him something he 'll never be sorry for knowing . He could see that Concha was not just running through her repertory like a wound-up doll , as she had done at the rehearsal with the company , but was putting her heart , or whatever stood for her heart , into the matter , with perfect effectiveness . It was easy to see that she had reduced that glittering-haired boy , who had struck him as no great specimen of wit at best , to a state of bliss bordering on idiocy , in this sudden half-relief from the hopeless ferocities of his desire which was , if only he could have known , so simple , so usual , and at his age and in his prime condition , so easily satisfied . Why could he not put on a cheerful grin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his situation , obviously under the thumb of his dying old uncle , the lack of money was no doubt the main reason why he could not put on the cheerful grin . That too was a commonplace . Freytag , having somehowrecovered his own self-approval , left them dancing and walked on . Jenny , who had borne all she was able of David 's silence and sulkiness , and tight , white-ringed mouth at dinner , after a day of sitting or strolling about with him , the air between them twanging painfully at every passing breeze , disappeared into her cabin to write letters to several members of her family . Though David never believed it , nop186matter what she told him , Jenny had , in a mid-Southern state , a small but pertinacious family of brothers , sisters , aunts , uncles , cousins , even a small niece and nephew , the quite most conventional assortment , really ; and she was fond of them all , in a baffled , detached sort of way . As she began " Dear . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lot she addressed the letter to , for they presented to her the impermeable front of what she called " the family attitude "  --  suspicionof the worst based on insufficient knowledge of her life , and moral disapproval based firmly on their general knowledge of the weaknessof human nature . Jenny could n't possibly be up to any good , or she would have stayed at home , where she belonged . That is the sum of it , thought Jenny , and would n't their blood run cold if they could only know the facts ? Ah well , the family can get under your skin with little needles and scalpels if you venture too near them : they attach suckers to you and draw your blood from every pore if you do n't watch out . But that did n't keep you from loving them , nor them from loving you , with that strange longing , demanding , hopeless tenderness and bitterness , wound into each other in a net of living nerves . It was no question at all whether they were the kin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate ; they were the family you belonged to , and there you were , stuck for good , for life and for eternity itself , no doubt . At this point in her half-conscious meditations with her pen hesitating above the paper , Jenny dropped the " you " form , and stopped thinking in words , only knowing in her bones that she could not live near her family because she was afraid of their weaknesses and faults  --  they were also her own ; and most of their virtues repelled her even more than their faults . She had spent years of strategic warfare trying to beat those people out of her life ; then more years trying to ignore them ; to forget them ; to hate them ; and in the end she loved them as she knew well she was meant in simple natureto do , and acknowledged it ; it brought her no peace , and yet it put a certain solid ground under her feet . She did not turn to them at last for help , or consolation , or praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last because she was incapable of turning away . They were the family and she was the stray sheep ; they never let her forget it , they were full of malice and resentment they could not hide , and they invented little slanders about her among themselves to justify their view of what they called her " desertion . " And moreover , they could n't be fooled for a moment with all thatp187nonsense about wanting to paint , to be an " artist . " A young woman of good family leaves her home and place for only one reason : she means . to lead a shameless abandoned life where her relatives and her society can not restrain or punish her . Artist indeed ! What was to stop her painting at home in the back garden ? With all this and a good deal more running not exactly in her mind but in her bloodstream , Jenny was writing , " Dearest Cousin or Brother or sweet Nephew or Aunt . . . weather is beautiful , getting cooler ... I am in wonderful health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear from you ... yours , yours and yours with my love ... " yours indeed , with my love , my devilish dear family ! She was folding up the last when Elsa came in from the moving pictures , with traces of tears in her eyes , yet cheerful and ready to talk . She sat on the side of her bed and began letting down her hair . " Mama does n't like it this way , " she told Jenny , shyly . " I do n't either , really , " said Jenny , " the other is prettier . " There had been moving pictures for the first time , and when Jenny had suggested to David that they see them , David had said he could n't imagine a reason for passing an evening in such a stupid way , and Jenny had retorted at once that she could n't imagine anything more stupid than the way they were passing it now . That had settled the question and ended the talk , and they spent the evening apart , Jenny writing letters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pictures were just the kind she liked best , the kind one saw so seldom in Mexico , where they were always about bandits fighting on horseback in the mountains , and burning ranches ; and low women always after men ; and all sorts of ugly people playing bad tricks on each other . No , these two pictures were very different . They were German , and so sweet . As she sat gettingready for bed , she remembered the plots utterly . There was one about the miller 's beautiful daughter who was loved by two rich gentlemen , real lords  --  father and son . She will not have the father , who forbidsher to have the son , whom she loves . By a vile plot , she is seized by two villainous servants of the old lord , while she is picking flowers by the millstream , and taken to the lodge of the gamekeeper , and there she is heartlessly married off to that low person , who is a widower with a daughter her own age , the old lord standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel way ! " Where was the son ? " asked Jenny , stamping envelopes.  | " He had just happened to go on a journey , " said Elsa . " But the gamekeeper 's daughter thought of a way to help her . She pretended to go with the bride to her room to help her undress , but instead she tied sheets together and let her down out of the window and the new bride ran home through the woods  --  oh it was beautiful with the moonlight shining in the treetops  --  and the wicked gamekeeper sets out after her ; but his foot slips on the bridge of the millstream  --  it is an act of God , you understand  --  and he is drowned . And just at that moment the young lord comes home and learns everything ; and the girl is restored to him a virgin widow ! " " What became of the old lord ? " asked Jenny . " He repented and gave them his blessing , " said Elsa . " The last scene was the wedding in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dance on the village green . I wish they would show more pictureslike that . . . the girl was so pretty , and the young man was so handsome , and they were so happy together ! " " It 's a fine big wedding cake with plenty of icing and sugar birds and roses , " said Jenny , " like the one you 'll have someday . " " Oh , I hope so , " said Elsa , but doubtfully as ever . " The second picturewas nice too . . . " Jenny reached for a light wrap , laid it across her knees , and sat waiting for the end . " It was a little hard to follow because there was so much happening all the time , but there was a handsome young Archdukewho wished to marry only for love , and he would not wed the Grafin von Hohenbrecht sight unseen , out of obedience to his dear parents , who arranged the marriage for his own good  --  you know how parents are , " said Elsa , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor old people , who want him to be happy , make a plot with the Grafin 's father and mother to bring them together in some way so that they are both disguised and take each other for simple peasants . You will understand that the Grafin , too , is romantic and has also refused even to meet the Archduke , for she wants to marry only for love . Well , the Grafin 's parents tell her it is time for her to know something about life and how to run a castle , and that she is to dress like a laundry maid and go with servants to the river for the washing day . But she does n't do any work , you know , she just orders the others around . Meantime they have arranged for the Archduke , disguised as a forester , to be hunting in that part of the woods with some of his men . He sees the beautiful maiden , she secsp189him , they fall in love on sight , of course ! that 's the point ; and the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his whole life , and will marry only the laundry maid and no one else . Then the two families have a great time carrying on the joke and making difficultiesuntil they are sure the love is real . Meantime the Archduke and the Grafin put on their disguises and run away to meet each other in the forest every time they can manage . This goes on for a long time , until finally everything comes out ; and there is a great wedding , in a cathedral , and afterwards a gay ball at the castle , and the servants all dance on the castle green . Oh , " said Elsa , suddenly , " you 'll think I 'm just silly . I know already that life is not like that , I do n't expect any such thing . And yet , " she said , " I do n't understand those Cuban students . Even that tall nice-looking one who sings so well  --  you remember the one I like ?  --  well , he was just like the rest . All through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they jeered , and whistled , and yowled like cats and behaved so badly a steward asked them for silence . So they all got up and went away with that Condesa , you know the prisoner , and she was making fun too . I ca n't understandpeople being so hardhearted  --  they were sweet pictures full of lovely scenes  --  " " The trouble with those students is simply that they have n't been born yet , " said Jenny , severely . " They are just their parents ' bad dreams . Elsa , you should try to forget about that boy . " " How can I forget him , " asked Elsa , a trifle fretfully , " when I see him every day ? But my mother says La Condesa is a disreputable woman , title or no title , and that I must on no account even speak to her . How can I speak to an older woman unless she speaks to me first ? And yet , how I should love to know what it is like to be that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elsa , you are coming on , fast . What an idea . . . what would your mother say ? Now tell me , after this merry evening at the movies , why were you crying ? " " I am so happy sometimes , and then so miserable , " confessed Elsa , simply , and she wiped her eyes where the tears began to form again . " That 's all right then , " said Jenny hastily , " if it 's nothing more seriousthan that . I 'm not sleepy . I 'll take a turn around the deck and look at the moon ; good night . " " Good night , " said Elsa , in a pacified voice ; and the long confusions of her day slipped into easy dreams.  |p190Frau  Otto Schmitt was still feeling somewhat intimidated by her recent encounters with a world of male unaccountability which she found dismaying in her new and tender state of widowhood . She was beginning to realize with astonishment that she had never really known any man but her husband ; no women except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers as remote from her womanly confidences as if they belonged to another species . For years she had hardly seen anyone , outside of her classrooms of younger students , except in the company of her husband : indeed , she had lived her married life almost literally in his presence . His state of health after the war had made it seem at times almost as if he were her child ; in better times , a kind sympatheticbrother ; yet always her husband , after all . And oh , what a poor preparation for her life without him he had given her ! Where could she turn , to whom could she speak , sure of a gentle human response ? Almost she took it as an answer to prayer when Dr. Schumann appearedalone at the head of the deck and stood at the rail . She approachedhim as nearly as she might without , she hoped , appearing to ambush him , but she longed to be near him if only for a moment , for he soothed and reassured her sense of all that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left side of his face was turned towards her , and she could have worshipped that noble Mansur scar . Her husband 's scar , quite as impressive as the Doctor 's , had been her life 's pride . It reminded her of salutary facts : that his family had been superior to her own , that his university dueling had further enhanced him socially ; that altogether he could have made an advantageous marriage , a rich one . But no , he had chosen her , with her tiny dowry , and her brothers who had never touched a foil ; and had never , he told her , regretted it for a moment ; for which she never ceased to be grateful to him . The Doctor 's scar was as perfectly placed as could be : for if a student flinched , turned his head or lowered his chin , he was apt to be slashed even on the forehead , or the cheekbone  --  she had seen too many such scars  --  and it was a disgrace to him , unless it could be blamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does one go about explaining that , all one 's life ? Frau Schmitt had grown a little tired of hearing Frau Rittersdorf boast that her husband was a bold dueler , always the challenger , always the victor , with four scars on his left cheek , every one a beauty , a split to the teeth , and not a quarter-inch apart ! Well , she suspected Frau Rittersdorf of exaggeration , at times . Besides , onep191good scar well placed was enough  --  what was it for , after all ? A token in the living flesh , another kind of medal bestowed for proved courage . Having achieved it , a gentleman might then go about his other concernsand occupations . In her shy adoring mood she almost crept towards the Doctor , who turned and gave her that serious smile she admired in him , and seemed about to speak , when the raucous chorus of " Cucaracha " broke upon the evening air . La Condesa , in a flowing white dress and green sandals , sailed out of the salon in her swarm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Doctor , and walked on swiftly , her skirts flying , the students howling their song and keepingtime in a rumba step . One of them , a stringy boy in purple tweed Oxford bags , like tucked-up skirts , lolloped in the rear a safe distance , mimicking her frail complaining voice : " Ah , youth , beautiful youth , she 's not having any , thank you . " He even had the impudence to wink outright at Frau Schmitt , who scarcely believed her eyes . She turned in dismay to Dr. Schumann , and could only gasp , " Well ! . . . but did you ever ? " Dr. Schumann moved nearer , and they stood together watching the students  --  their convulsed gait , their apelike grimacing , the flying impudentgestures of their hands , in the graceful wake of La Condesa . How could she , who seemed so acutely aware of herself and all around her , tolerate for a moment such effrontery ? He suppressed a huge sigh , turned back to the sea , and said to Frau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly to be believed , the malignance of the young . We hear a great deal , do we not ? spoken against the middle-aged , and too much of it is true  --  about our growing faults of sloth , of selfishness , of complacency , of despair  --  " " I hope not despair , dear Dr. Schumann , " said Frau Schmitt , uneasily . " Above all , despair , " said the Doctor firmly . " But the real wickedness , " he said , " is in youth . We sin , we older ones , and we know we sin ; some of us try hard to repent , to make reparation . But they  --  " he inclined his head towards the students  --  " they sin and they do not even know it ; or they know it and they glory in it . They are shameless , cruel , and proud . . . they love themselves with a passion unknown to age  --  perhaps exhausted , " he added , with some sudden touch of humor , " in age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against all that exists , from the human heart to the Holy Ghost , and when theyp192are tired of sinning they lie down and sleep like newly washed lambs . All that ignorant scorn and mockery , " said the Doctor , " all that senselesscruel jeering against a lady who is suffering , and who has never harmed them ! " Frau Schmitt said , with naive , gentle wonder : " But Doctor ! This is the first time I ever heard you speak harshly ! " " I mean to be harsh , " said the Doctor , calmly . " I am the voice of rebuke itself lifted in the wilderness , or over the waste of waters ! I wish my words were stones that I might throw them to crack the heads of those savages . " " Or their hearts , " said Frau Schmitt . " No , they have no hearts , " said the Doctor . Frau Schmitt was silent , feeling that she had been drawn beyond her depths , and yet , such depths as she longed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the figure of La Condesa disappearingaround the stern ; saw what she saw , read it in her own way , thought her own simple thoughts . What a pity such a good man should fall in love with such a woman . And at his age too , and married , and all ! Oh , it was frightening , and it happened all too often . Her faith in the Doctor wavered , sank , recovered somewhat , but never in its former glory . She felt newly wounded , left out of things again , life was going to pass her by . She wished only to say her rosary and place herself in God 's hands , and go to sleep and forget . There was never again to be anything pleasant or good in this world for her . After a stricken moment , she murmured a little formal phrase proper to leave-taking , and went on her way . Dr. Schumann wondered at himself , reflected somewhat on his words , and regretted them as immoderate : that is , spoken out of place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the wrong person  --  indeed , they should never have been spoken at all , he concluded , the feeling which inspired them being itself suspect . He made a little Act of Contrition in the depths of his mind , stretched himself in the nearest deck chair , and closed his eyes . The deck was dimly lighted and deserted for the moment , all silence except for the lulling sound of the waves . Dr. Schumann , who before had been playing with the notion of signing up for another voyage , then and there in a flash of insight knew that this voyage was to be his last . In his relief at being given a glimpse of the certain end of a journey that was proving to be ,  |p193mysteriously  , a surprisingly trying time for him , the Doctor fell into a gentle sleep . When he opened his eyes , La Condesa was stretched beside him in the neighboring chair to his right , quite at her ease , wide awake , pensively beautiful , regarding the darkened sea as if she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazed he almost stammered : " W-what have you done with those terrible young men ? " " They can be a little dull at times , that 's true , " she told him calmly . " They got tired of playing the monkey , and said they were going to play dice . You were sleeping enviably . How do you do it ? " Dr. Schumann sat up , feeling refreshed and restored to his center . He said almost merrily , " A clear conscience , of course ! " " Of course , " said La Condesa . " I can see that you are a man who could not live without a clear conscience . " " There are worse things to have , " said the Doctor , sturdily , being by now well aware that he must begin to take a firmer hand with this erratic lady who was after all his patient . " Tell me , have you nothing to reproach your own conscience with just now ? " " I know nothing about a conscience , " said La Condesa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which does almost as well . . . intermittently ! But as to my promise to you , I have kept it until now  --  can you not see ? But it does not make me happy ; no , it causes me acute anguish , I have cactus in my veins , and why do I do it ? For you , as I told you ; why do you ask more ? " " I did not even ask that , " said Dr. Schumann , " that least of all . Indeed , I never would have made so bold as to dream of such a thing . " " I know , " said La Condesa , almost with tenderness . " I need badly something to help me sleep . I can not endure any longer . " " Try just a little longer to do without , " said the Doctor , " and I promise to help you when the time comes . " " I detest martyrdom in all its forms , " said La Condesa . " So unbecomingto me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet , see  --  here I am promising to be both because you think it may be good for me  --  good for what , my soul ? " " Your soul as well , no doubt , " said the Doctor , amiably . " Do you expect some great change in me because of this strange voyage , so unexpected , so unlike anything I have ever known ? " asked La Condesa . " A miracle of some kind ? "  |p194The  Doctor began to speak , and at that point they both noticed the rather comic pair , the scrawny Lizzi and the little fat Herr Rieber , ascendingto the boat deck , followed rather furtively at a little distance by Ric and Rac , the twins . Neither La Condesa nor the Doctor mentionedthese apparitions , or hardly noticed them , and went on with their conversation , pleasantly . Ric and Rac , after skulking about the boat deck , keeping well out of sight of the objects of their attentions , whose habits and designs they knew well , heard at last a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great funnel , a fairly dark and private place : a light scuffling , slipping boot heels , frantic smothered feminine yaps and hisses , a male voice gleefully gurgling and crowing . Ric and Rac could not understand the words , but they knew in their bones the lingua franca of gallantry . Discreetly as little foxes they approached , holding each other back , for fear the other would get the first glimpse , exchanging shrewd glances , the whites of their eyes gleaming , their pointed red tongues running round their open mouths . The wind whistled past their ears and whipped their hair against their cheeks ; their stringy garments flattened against their meager frames as they leaned upon the funnel and slid round towards the enticing noises . In greedy silence and stillness they observed the expected scene . Lizzi and Herr Bieber were huddled together on the deck , backs to the funnel , fighting , laughing , wrestling . He was trying to play with her knees , and she was pulling down her skirts with one hand and pushing feebly at him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the bony girl broke away and shoved the fat man almost over on his back . The front of her blouse was open almost to the belt and the children remarked with distaste that there was really nothing to see . Tossing her head about , squealing , the girl 's wild eyes pointed suddenly at Ric and Rac . She gave a shrill , new kind of scream , " Oh , look , oh look , oh  --  " waving her long arms at them . Herr Rieber sobered at once , and as Lizzi sprang upright in an instantaneousunfolding movement like a jackknife , he got to his feet by squatting first , then supporting himself on a coil of rope and at last heaving himself up with a laborious groan . Ric and Rac merely took a step backward around the funnel , still gazing , balanced for flight if necessary.  | " What are you doing here , you shameless creatures ? " asked Herr Rieber , taking a somewhat choked but severely paternal tone . ' Watching you , " said Rac , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , " Go on , do n't stop . We 'll tell you if anybody 's coming . " Herr Rieber , honestly shocked by such early cynicism , rushed at them snarling , with ready hands , but they leaped out of his reach . " Out of here ! " bawled Herr Rieber , almost beside himself . Ric and Rac danced , actually clapping their hands for pure glee , as Herr Rieber bounded here and there after them , aiming blows which landed in air and turned him right about . Ric and Rac pranced savagely around him , shouting , " A peso , a peso , or we 'll tell  --  a peso or we 'll tell  --  a peso  --  " " Monsters ! " cried Lizzi hoarsely . " You horrible little  --  " " A peso , a peso ! " chanted Ric and Rac , still sliding around Herr Rieber and avoiding his blows with perfect ease . Herr Rieber stopped , panting , head down like an exhausted bull in the ring . He reached in his pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his foot on it . " One for her too , " he said , " one for her . " His face was sharp and cool and wary . Herr Rieber cast away another peso . Ric snatched them both and clutching them in one hand he motioned to Rac , who followed him instantly . Running , they collided somewhere at the head of the steps , and both of them saw the same thing at once and had the same notion about it . The canvas covering of one of the lifeboats was partly unfastened , it hung loose and could easily be opened further . They tried the fastenings , which gave way surprisingly ; they raised the flap and wriggled into the boat , Rac first , Ric following , without a word . The boat was very much deeper than they had thought . With a good deal of scrambling about , they managed to bring their faces up to the opening in the flap , where they listened attentively , faces touching , for some moments . Then the fat man and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both of them very angry-looking . Ric lost his balance and made a scrabbling noise ; the girl turned her head and peered toward them without seeing ; then she stumbled on the steps and the fat man took her arm . " Careful , my beautiful , " he said softly . " Stop that , " she said , bitterly , snatching away from him . Ric and Rac fell back into the boat , all tangled up giggling in the darkness . " Give me my peso , " said Rac fiercely , clutching Ric in thep196ribs and digging her nails in . " Give me my peso or I 'll tear your eyes out . " ' Take it , " said Ric , in the same tone , clenching his fist over the money . " Go on , take it , just try ! " Locked in what seemed to be a death grapple , they rolled to the bottom of the boat and fought furiously , knees in ribs , claws in hair ; the pain they inflicted on each other had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet and then began to giggle again . A young officer passing stopped to listen , his face very thoughtful . Stepping forward , he snatched back the canvas , and whatever he saw there appeared to turn him to stone for a second . Then , throwing himself over the side and bending down nearly head first , he seized them and dragged them both over the side of the boat . They were as light as if their bones were hollow , and they came out limp and dangling as broken dolls . La Condesa and Dr. Schumann remained at ease in their long chairs , watching the ship 's lights dance in the darkened sea , and the Doctor was saying : " One has no new weaknesses , no new strengths , but only developments , accentuations , diminishments , or perversions of original potentialities . These may at times be so abrupt and powerful they give the illusion of radical change , but it is only illusion , I am afraid . As one grows older , one is more conscious of the shifting , unstable elementsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assumecontrol , you might say . One realizes at last , simply and perhaps with some dismay , that what one was told in childhood is after all true  --  one is immortal certainly , but not in this flesh . One . . . " He paused . " One , one  --  one , " said La Condesa lightly . " Who is this One you are always talking about ? Let 's talk about us  --  you and me , precisely . " " Myself , I have a very ordinary weakness of the heart ; so I ship as doctor for a voyage or two , following the prescription I have so often given others , hoping for a little repose , imagine . Now if only I can live long enough once more to see my wife chasing the chickens out of our country kitchen with a broom , and scolding steadily , I shall ask no more of this world . How much that dear woman has scolded me , and everybody and everything , all her married life , at least , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for truly she is nearly always right  --  and what has it come to ? "  |p197'Well  , " said La Condesa gaily , " for you at least , it has come to an end for a little while . " Dr. Schumann chose to smile only a little at this and looked away over the rail to the waters . " Imagine me , a doctor , after all these years in quiet Heidelberg thinking I should find repose from the world on a ship . I am astonished at myself for thinking , now maybe I shall learn something new about myself or the people I live with ; but no such thing . I have seen all this before , over and over , only never until now did I see it on a ship . These people I have seen them all before , only in other places , under different names . I know their diseases almostby looking at them , and if you know what sickness is in a man you very often can tell what form his vices and his virtues have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said La Condesa , clasping her long hands lightly about her knee and bending forward from the leg rest of her chair . There appeared at the upper end of the deck an unusual group in a state of violent action . A young officer with his cap knocked crooked was struggling with those dreadful Spanish twins . Yet in spite of all , the officer continued to advance firmly and managed a kind of ragged progress toward Dr. Schumann and La Condesa , hauling his captives , who were trying to bite his hands . " More mischief , " said Dr. Schumann , his serenity fading away . " I have yet to see those children in a situation where they are not making trouble for somebody . " He called out to the young officer , ' What is happening ? " The young officer blushed at the question . He planted himself before the Doctor and renewed his grip on Ric and Rac , who suddenly gave up struggling and stood stock-still , sullen eyes gazing at nothing . The young officer began : " Sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a concerted bolt for freedom in opposite directions so that his arms flew wide but he did not lose hold of them . His blush deepened until his ears seemed about to burst into flames . He turned his head from side to side , mouth opening and closing in silence , appealing to them both wordlessly that in the presence of a lady he could not continue . " I am a mother , " said La Condesa encouragingly , giving him a most unmaternal smile ; her bright red mouth rounded and softened , her eyebrowswent up . " I can guess the very worst and truly I must say I do not find it so bad . What do you think , Doctor ? "  | " I agree that no matter what they did , they are little monsters , " said Dr. Schumann , bending his head to observe them without hope , " and entirely outside any usual mode of discipline . " " They were in a lifeboat , " said the young officer , stuttering slightly . " They had unfastened the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And were amusing themselves ? " asked La Condesa . " Well , il faut passer la jeunesse . . . infancy is a great bore , I find , one 's own first , and then other peoples ' . . . my poor children were not in the least monstrous , on the contrary almost disconcertingly normal  --  but they were quite simply bores until they were eighteen years old . Then they became charming young men to whom one could talk . I do not know how this miracle occurs . And so , " she added , " we must wait and have patience with such phenomena as these , " and she smiled enchantinglyat the children , who stared back with utter malignance . " Nothing of the sort will happen with these , " said Dr. Schumann . " Their evil is in the egg of their souls . " And then to the young officer : " Ca n't you just hand them over to their parents ? " " Their parents , my God ! " said the young officer , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen them , sir ? " " Then , " said La Condesa , " I see nothing for it but to let them go  --  or , " and she looked tenderly into the burning eyes of the two little criminals , " perhaps we should save time and trouble for everybody if we threw them overboard ? " " Yes , Madame , a good idea , " said the young officer , bitterly , " and a pity it can not be carried out . " " Oh , you take everything too seriously , " she said . " They 're only children . " " Devil-possessed , though , " said Dr. Schumann . La Condesa studied his friendly benevolent face now overcast with an almost military severity . " What an old-fashioned sort of man you are , " she said , admiringly . The Doctor 's eyelids flinched once . " Yes , I know  --  a little dull , no doubt . " " But charming ! " she said , and reached for his hand . The young officer , whose moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost as shocked by this gesture as he had been by the sight of Ric and Rac in the boat . So all the rumors he had heard about La Condesa were true ! He saw himself abandoned to hisp199dilemma with Ric and Rac  --  very well , they were no worse than their elders . Let them do as they pleased . He loosed them as if he were throwing off vipers ; they broke instantly into their long , shambling run up the deck . He then bowed with a courtesy as false as he dared to show to La Condesa and the Doctor , straightened his cap and moved on . La Condesa glanced after him and laughed , in a fresh , joyous tone , her eyes glistening . " Poor , nice young man , " she said , " he 's still too young  --  too young to remember his own childhood . Dear Doctor , I have never understood the dogma of Original Sin . Children are only perfectly natural little animals before they are brought under the whip  --  why be shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good in these , " said the Doctor . " Never these . Why deceive ourselves with hope ? They will come to no good end . " " They are not in such a good state now , " said La Condesa . She leaned back and drew a long breath . ' What kind of childhood had you ? " " An innocent one , " said Dr. Schumann , in perfect good temper again , " or so I like to think . " " Ah , so you like to think and maybe it is true , " cried La Condesa . " But ca n't you remember anything interesting at all ? Did nothing gay ever happen to you ? " Dr. Schumann meditated in silence for a few moments , began to smile rather reluctantly , then decided to make a clean breast of it . " Innocence , " he began , " our highly debatable innocence . . . " " So you do have some amusing memories , " said La Condesa , laying her silky hand over his , the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , truth  --  to encourage you  --  I was never innocent , never . I had not the opportunity , for one thing , surrounded as I was by attractive cousins , boys of the most adventurous temperament , like mine . I had no aptitude for it , above all , never the wish . I could never endure to think that any secret or any pleasure was being kept from me . I surmised without help , everything , very early . From there to experience , it was only a step ; from experience to habit a matter of moments . I can not be sorry for anything except that I did not always make the most of my chances ! " " I was innocent , " said Dr. Schumann , " as a calf ; full of hopes and animal spirits , a simple soul without a care , believing everything I wasp200taught , an obedient loving child . . . I could be kissed into anything , " he said . " But still , it is true that at the age of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at six I was in turn seduced by a little girl playmate aged nine . In our ignorance , we did preposterous things  --  not even parodies , " he said . " Both of my playmates were very nice , charming , virtuous girls who turned out well , married happily , and spanked their own children thoroughly for the least thing . Yet I say , the impulses that drove us were grounded in Original Sin , in which I believe as I do the Real Presence . ... " " I believe in neither , " said La Condesa , without emphasis . " Still you must allow me my beliefs , " said the Doctor , gently . " As for innocence , does anyone know what it is ? For I remember guilt and pleasure , always associated , yet never seeming to touch that part of my life and those acts founded on the moral law and which seemed real to me and not a fable , or a mere daydream , and which I do believe were innocent . " " I shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are we not talking for pleasure ? Theological discussion fills me with gloom . I had all the joys of sinning as you call it , without guilt , " she said , with a certain complacency . " But you must have been a most charming little person . I should have adored you , even then . Some of my crimes were of a base , unimaginative order , I am sorry to say . When I was four I persuaded my little brother to drink lye-water used for cleaning drains , telling him it was milk . He took a mouthful , spat it out , ran shrieking . He was rescued at once , his mouth scrubbed out ; I was punished , beaten black and blue ; otherwise nothing came of it . And indeed , I meant no harm  --  I was only curious to see whether it would kill him . But older people do not understand these things . " " Ah , childhood , " said Dr. Schumann , " time of the tender bud , the unfolding leaf . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs . " Truth is , it was not so had , " said La Condesa . She lifted the Doctor 's hand and slipped her fingers between his , knitting them together . " I love you , " she said , gently and unexpectedly . " Not so much you , perhaps , though you are very nice , but I love what you are . I like gravity and seriousness and strong principles in a man . There is nothing more repellant to me than a frivolous , timid , vacillating man , who does not know his own mind and his own heart . And why ? Becausep201then he can not ever know the mind and heart of a woman . Were you ever unfaithful to your wife ? " " Well ! " exclaimed Dr. Schumann . " What a question ! " " Oh yes , I know , you have to be surprised and even a little shocked . It is quite proper , you are always right . But think a moment . It is not just curiosity and impertinence in me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more besides , and it is that something more I want you to believe  --  " Dr. Schumann untangled his fingers from hers , took her hand in his , and then slipped his fingers to her pulse . " How does it do ? " she asked . " Is it settling down ? " " Very well , " he said , " perhaps better than mine just now . But then I have told you , " he said , and yet could not help mentioning again his unsteady heart . " At any moment , " he told her , and laid her hand down again . " I think it is enviable to know how you will die , " she said , " and that it will be sudden and not ugly . I wish I knew , because I am afraid of long suffering and disfigurement . I do n't want to leave a hideous body behind me  --  " " You are just hopelessly vain , " said Dr. Schumann , and it sounded as if he were praising her . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who has it . And it is hard to come into the world in beauty and to go out in ugliness . And it is like any other gift or quality in the least worth having , you must be born with it , you can not acquire it , and you should treat it as it deserves . " " But you find me beautiful now ? " " Of course , " said the Doctor . After a short pause he said , " I will answer your question truthfully . I was never unfaithful to my wife . " " How charming of you , " said La Condesa , sympathetically . " It must have been dull at times . " Dr. Schumann , who had always viewed himself as the soul of reserve , found himself possessed by a demon of frankness . " It was , " he answered simply , amazed at himself , " but she was faithful to me , and t hat could have been a little dull for her , too , at times . " " Were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or was it sour weak heart ? " " My heart was sound until about two years ago , " said Dr. Schumann with a faint trace of resentment , feeling that his confidence was being abused , and that perhaps he deserved it.  | " But you love me just a little , do n't you ? " " No , " said Dr. Schumann , " not at all . Not at all if I know in the least what love is . I know what I should say , I know that is not very gallant , but I am not a man who can afford to say what he does not mean ; and would you wish to hear it ? There is perhaps not time for that sort of thing . " La Condesa took his chin between thumb and fingers and kissed him on the forehead twice . Her round mouth left two shiny red smears on his face . Dr. Schumann looked very pleased but quite calm . " You are delicious , " she told him . " You are exactly right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me wipe your dirty face . " She touched her wet tongue to her small lace-bordered handkerchief and scrubbed away the red spots and said , " If anyone saw us now , they would think we were the most devoted married pair . " " Someone has already seen us , " said Dr. Schumann , " the very one of all people who would enjoy it most . " They sat in silence , hands folded , heads inclined towards the sea , faces tranquil , as Frau Rittersdorf strolled by alone . " Such divine weather for sitting out , " she informed them in a high clear voice , full of the most intimate sympathy and comprehension . She paused , shivered a little , and wrapped her thin scarf about her bare arms . " Perhaps one should be careful of the night air , especially at sea , " she said , smiling gaily . She bent over and peered into their faces with the most ravenous inquiry . They gazed back calmly . A second 's hesitationand Frau Rittersdorf moved on slowly , tossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arthritis lurk in night air and we 're only young once . " " What a museum piece , " said La Condesa , also in a high , clear sweet voice , aimed at Frau Rittersdorf 's undulating shoulder blades . " Oh come now , " said Dr. Schumann mildly , " do leave that sort of thing to her , " and he seemed ruffled and uncomfortable . La Condesa gave a little saw-edged trill of laughter . Then she fell silent again for a moment , and her face was grieved and weary . " I loathe women , " she said , in a tone of flat , commonplace sincerity such as the Doctor had never heard in her voice . " I hate being one . It is a shameful condition . I can not be reconciled to it . " " That is a pity , " said Dr. Schumann , who in his heart knew that he quite agreed with her . But he did his manly duty of reassuring her . " And you are quite wrong . It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to think so , but there is nothing shameful in it  --  it is a destiny to be faced , like any other . Truth is , " he told her earnestly , " you are a more than ordinarily perverse sort of being , and a change of sex would do nothing for you . There are many men of your temperament and of your habits ; if you were a man , you would still be a mischief-maker , a taker of drugs , a seducer . " La Condesa rose lightly as a cloud , opened her arms wide as if to embrace him , leaned over him smiling and exhilarated . " Naturally ! " she said with delight , " but think with what freedom , and more opportunity , and no scolding from mossy old souls like you ! " Dr. Schumann rose deliberately and stepped back from her hands that were about to rest on his shoulders . " I am not scolding , " he said , in pure forthright anger , " and you are talking like any foolish woman ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried La Condesa over his shoulder , for he had turned and was leaving her , " like any foolish man ! " and her terrible peals and trills of laughter followed him , blowing like a cold rain down his collar as she ran after him , came abreast , slipped her arm around his elbow , folded her hand in his . " You are adorable and you ca n't shake me off , " for Dr. Schumann was trying to reclaim his arm without losing at least the appearance of dignity . She loosed him then and stepped before him , and he saw that her eyes were wild and inhuman as a monkey 's . " Stop , " she said , her laughter threatening to slide into tears . She held his hands and laid her head on his shoulder lightly for an instant . " Oh , ca n't you see ? I am tired , I am crazy , I must sleep or die . . . You must give me a pigi re , a huge one that will make me sleep for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ca n't  --  you sha n't , I wo n't let you go ! . . . Oh , quiet me  --  put me to sleep ! " Dr. Schumann gripped her hands and held her off , searching her face shrewdly , hoping to be able to refuse her ; but what he saw decidedhim at once . " Yes , " he said , " yes . " She turned at once , dropping her hands at her side , and they walked together through the ship towards her cabin . " Ah , " she said , and raised to him under the mottled light of the passage a ravaged and desolate face , unbelievably changed , " ah , you are so good . Oh , never believe I am not grateful . . . and now I can keep my promise not to take any more ether ! " " Ether , " said the Doctor , on a rising note of diciplinary severity . " You still have ether ? You did keep back a flask , then ? "  | " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of voice with a faintly contemptuous impatience . " When will you learn not to trust me in anything ? " Dr. Schumann stopped short and turned to face her . " Even now ? " he asked . " Even now , " she said boldly . Before the expression in his face as he studied hers for the space of a breath , she lowered her eyelids and glanced aside . " Well , " he said at last , in a dry distant voice , " you shall have your piqu.re just the same . Go on by yourself , " he said , turning off towards his own cabin . " I will join you in a few minutes . You may trust me , as you know well enough , " he said , and was amazed at his own bitterness . She turned and went her way as if she had already forgotten him , as if his given word could be so taken for granted she could treat it lightly  --  which was true , he admitted to himself with a wry little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he was selecting and arranging the ampules for the piqure , the doctor began to think fairly clearly and in a more or less straight line , with the reasonable , cooler part of his mind . He had not failed , he thought , in his responsibility to her as her physician . Yet he could not deny that his personal feelings for her had intervened and helped to create a situationvery unbecoming to him  --  to her , also , he admitted with reluctance . But all these shocks and upsets  --  her constant turning of every meeting between them into scenes which left them both prostrated ; the constant danger of his having another heart attack ; her reckless disregard for appearances , which could so easily make the kind of scandal the Doctor shuddered even to think about  --  ah , well , it all must end . He called upon not only the reserves of his authority as ship 's physician , but , if she resisted , upon the Captain 's final word , and resolved that this unruly relationship should be put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hysterical woman with no control over her own acts . She could have been the death of him with her silly melodramas . Nonsense , and there was to be no more of it . Yet , he in tended to be merciful and consign her to a narcotic limbo , which was , after all , her notion of Paradise . " Oh , " said La Condesa , sitting up at sight of him , her face shining with relief from anxiety , " I am so happy to see you again ! I was so afraid you would not come ! "  | " What ? " said Dr. Schumann , amazed . " When I had just assured you t hat I would not fail you ? " " Ah , " she said , " it is just then one should begin to doubt ! The eternal vow  --  ah , that is the one that is always broken ! " " I did not make any such vow , remember , " said Dr. Schumann , " it was only a little promise for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehension that ruffled his own nervous system and disturbedthe marrow of his bones ; here at any moment , if he did not act with speed and decision , was the beginning of another scene . " I am keeping here and now the promise I made you , " he told her , " and the only one I did make . " As he approached the side of her bed , needle poised , she dropped back on her pillows and gave him a melting glance of confidence . They smiled at each other lovingly as he took hold of her upper arm . Mrs. Treadwell sat in the middle of her narrow bunk as if it were an island , and played an intricate game of solitaire with miniature cards on a folding chessboard . She drank wine in slow occasional sips from a small glass ; when it was half empty she would pour a little more from a bottle of Burgundy standing on the floor beside her . She wore a nightgown of smooth white satin , with a buttoned-up collar and full bishop sleeves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a white ribbon , in the Alice in Wonderland style she had worn in bed since she was four or five . Yet viewed from without by an impartial eye , the scene , she decided , would be completelydisreputable . The lack of a table and tray for the bottle and glass , the bottle itself even , in the circumstances ; Lizzi 's clothes lying about in heaps just as she had stepped out of them ; the rank smell of Lizzi 's stale mingled scents all based on musk ; perhaps above all her own occupation , or pastime , contributed to an effect , oppressive to the last degree , of female disorder , hysterical solitude and general forlornness . Mrs. Treadwell had been in a pleasantly self-sufficient mood when she left the boredom of the upper deck for what had then seemed a reasonable prospect of silence , seclusion , an evening with her own thoughts , such as they were , and early sleep . Lizzi 's habits were fairly dependable . She stayed out usually until after midnight with that wretched little fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onep206shadowy recess to another , with a great deal of giggling and squealingand not too furtive fumbling . Then Lizzi would come in , steaming hot , knocking against objects , her awkward stride accommodating itself too late to the confined space , clicking on the light and revealing herself with her hair like electrified strings , and her pupils excited as a cat 's in the small mean-looking irises . She would step out of her shoes and kick them into a corner , step out of her flimsy frock and expose her long bony legs in their short pink pants and flesh-colored stockings . Dropping her brush and picking it up , without fail she would say in her insolent imitation of courtesy , " So sorry . I hope I did n't wake you , " in that voice which affected Mrs. Treadwell 's nerves like the sound of a file on metal . It was absurd to pretend to go on sleeping after that . The woman was , Mrs. Treadwell decided , the most entirely unattractiveanimal she had ever seen . Undressed , her ugliness was shocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was a beauty , as she sat before the spotty little looking glass of the washhand stand , looking deeply into her own eyes , the corners of her mouth twitching . She painted and powdered her face half a dozen times a day , putting on her mask as carefully and deliberately as an actress preparing to face her audience . Upon her head as if in baptism she poured her musky cologne out of a large square bottle , drenched her underarms until the liquid ran down her lean ribs , a flickering , selfabsorbedsmile on her face , her nostrils working like a rabbit 's . All her talk ran on about perfume , about clothes , about her shops , and men . " Friends , " she called them . " A man I know in Hamburg , a real gentle man , very rich  --  a friend , " she would say coyly , and rear the undersizedhead on the long neck with the cords in it . " I almost married him , but now I am glad I did not , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These friends however were not all so unfortunate , and they paid her at all times the most expensive attentions , the most overwhelming compliments ; she had them at her beck and call . Only the difficulty had been that there were so many of them . " One must choose some where , nicht wahr ? One ca n't marry them all , that 's a pity ! " Little by little though the truth leaked out ; most of them were married already , but that was a detail of no consequence ; they were all of them pre pared to break up their domestic arrangements at any moment if she said the word . But she loved her freedom too well , that was her trouble . " When I left my husband , he accused me of going away top207another man . Ha , ' I told him , what do you take me for ? There are five of them . ' " She would writhe with laughter at passages like this , flapping her hands . " Well of course , you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four , and none of them serious . But believe me , I am finished with marriage . I mean to amuse myself , but no more marriage ! " Mrs. Treadwell gathered up her playing cards and fitted them into their case . She folded the chessboard and set it aside , smoothed the slightly rumpled sheet and light blanket . There was a new chill in the air ; she shivered and closed her eyes . Why could she not remember what traveling was like in these out of the way places and on horrid little boats ? Why had n't she sense enough to stay in Paris the whole year round , yes even August  --  Paris was delicious in August  --  where she was always so safe from the sort of people she seemed to meet up with almost anywhere else ? The faces and figures of her fellow passengers , if they could be called that , were all in a muddle with the wrong names attached , and the very thought of them confused and oppressed her mind . Lizzi gossiped about them perpetually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . " Oh now , imagine  --  that Spanish Condesa , the prisoner , you know her ?  --  well , they say she is sleeping with every one of those students by turns . They are always in her cabin , sometimes two or three of them , and they say it is quite fantastic what goes on there . They say the Captain is outraged by it , but what exactly can he do ? Should he hilt a spy under her bed ? . . . and here is a marvelous thing ; you know that little sick man in the wheel chair ? Well , if you do n't watch carefully , he will reach out and touch and stroke you  --  that is , if you are a woman . He will pretend he is curing you of whatever ails you . The old hypocrite , at his age , and with one foot in the grave ! And do you know that miserable Jew they put by mistake with Herr Rieber ? Well , the other day he asked Herr Rieber , What time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herr Rieber said , Time to stop all Jew watches . ' Herr Rieber is very witty . He says the look on his face would have done anybody good . " Mrs. Treadwell threw off the gabbling Fury-like echoes , got up suddenlyshaking out her long gown and went to the porthole . The pure cool air bathed her face , she opened her mouth to breathe more freely , feeling soiled by what she had listened to in that cabin . The sea and the sky were almost one in the vast darkness , the waves just beneathp208rolled and washed back upon themselves in white foam in the rayed lights from the ship . What am I to do , she asked herself , where am I to go ? Life , death , she thought in cloudy fear , for she was not able to face the small immediate situations which might demand decision , action , settlement no matter how temporary . Her very vagueness frightenedher , for life and death , rightly understood , were ominous dreadfulwords , and she would never understand them . Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was meant to be pleasant , generous , simple . The future was a clear space of pure , silvery blue , like the sky over Paris in good weather , with feathery playful clouds racing and tumblingin the lower air ; all clean and crisp as the blue tissue paper in which all the white things of her childhood had been folded , to keep them white , to make them whiter , to give them icy-blue whiteness . She was always going to be gay and free , later , when she was rid of nurses and school was over , and there was always to be love  --  always love . Well , well , she said , drawing in her head , Life has been in fact quite disagreeable if not sordid in spots . If anybody called me a lady tramp I hope I should not have my feelings hurt . Nasty things have happened to me often and they were every one my own fault . I put myself in their way , not even knowing they were there , at first . And later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not real , of course . This is not Life , naturally . This is just an accident , like being hit by a truck , or trapped in a burning house , or held up and robbed or even murdered maybe  --  not the common fate of persons like me . Was I really ever married to a man so jealous he beat me until I bled at the nose ? I do n't believe it . I never knew a man like that  --  he is n't born yet . It 's something I read about in a newspaper . . . but I still bleed at the nose if I am frightened enough at anything . Would murder seem real , I wonder ? Or would I just say , Oh , this is n't happening either  --  not to me ! Yet , here I am cooped up in a dingy little cabin with a vulgar woman who will come in presently and begin talking about her " affairs . " She is a woman I would never have in my house except to dress my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit here smelling her horrible perfumesand sleeping in the same room with her ; and I have drunk too much wine and played thirty games of solitaire without winning once . Because otherwise life  --  this life , this is life , this beastly little businessp209here and now  --  would be too dreary and disgusting to be got through with another moment ... . She turned the covers down , smoothed them out again , and went back to bed ; drew her nightgown about her legs , shook her sleeves down into pretty folds , and poured another glass of wine , all her movementsvery calm and orderly , like a convent-bred girl . Maybe her ruinouschildhood was to blame for everything . A doctor had told her once , years ago , that sometimes it was as disastrous for a child to be loved too much as too little . How could a child love , or be loved , too much ? She thought the doctor was silly . Her childhood had been very had for her on the whole , no doubt , and very lovely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and breathing in her . The old house in Murray Hill was a beautiful ample house , she realized later ; then it had been merely her home . In her blood still were all those years of softness and warmth and safety , the easy procession of days , the luxury she had not known was luxury , everyone she knew lived so . And the gentleness of the voices and hands around her every day  --  her nurse 's voice , " I declare , this child is almost too meek ! " and her mother answering , " No , not meek at all  --  just very good-tempered . " Later she knew so many women who envied her because she had traveled in France and Italy every year of her childhood , and because the had been brought up in her girlhood in French and Swiss schools . She had not thought it so grand  --  mostly she remembered the discomfortsof those schools , the stuffiness of the mistresses , the cold water , the tasteless food , the niggling rules , the constant chapel , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeping or rejoicing with her roommate over the letters and little gifts from home . Each of them could weep or rejoice quite as freely over the other 's news and presents as her own . What was that girl 's name ? Her name , her roommate ? As if it mattered . As if she could even invent a regret for a bond that had no more substance than a drift of cigarette smoke . She turned the light on and took a cigarette and tried to break through the senseless melancholy blur of her thoughts . All those parties and dinners and dances and flowers of the year of her coming-out had whirled into one soft shimmer ; could they have been anything like so joyous as she remembered them now ? No dream of war  --  no dream of change . Her memories of that life  --  of her nurse who had in time become her maid , and always her near friendp210and confidante , how much more about her did this old nurse know than any parent or kin  --  had become a warm soothing mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had long got in the way of putting her self to sleep with them ; she had in this memory the happiness she had expected , had been taught to expect , in first love . Time had juggled everything , time was a liar and a cheat , but it could not touch anything that lay on the other side of that first love which had cut her life in two , leaving all that had happened before it enclosed and changeless , and true , so far as she could see , for all she had been able to learn . Keep it , keep it , her heart said , it is yours whether it was true or not . What if her father and mother could not recognize her now if they saw her ? In her flesh they slept serenely , loved and loving , not as remembered faces , nor in any arrested act or posture , but as her blood running softly in her veins , as the beat of her heart and the drawing of her breath . It was all real , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was twenty , life  --  life , what a word !  --  had been believable , for the more wonder in it , the more she could believe ; oh it had been anchored fast yet always in slow movement , like a ship in harbor . She had fallen in love with the wrong man , how wrong her parents never knew , for they never saw him , and she never went home afterwards  --  and the long nightmare had set in . Ten years of a kind of marriage , and ten years of divorce , shady , shabby , lonely , transient , sitting in cafes and hotels and boats and trains and theaters and strange houses with others transient as herself , for half her life , half her life , and none of it had really happened . Only one thing real had happened in all that time  --  her parents had been killed together in a motor accident , and she had not gone home to see them buried . For all the rest , she denied it , not a word of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't bear it , she said , and sat up again . I ca n't bear it . I do n't remember anything . Oh my dears , she said to her parents as if they were in the room with her , if you had known you would n't have let it happen . Oh why did n't I come home ? Why did n't I tell you ? She reached for the wine bottle and held it up to the light . There was nearly half the bottle left . That will be enough , she decided , if I drink it fast . She poured steadily into the glass , smiling . After all , soon she would be in Paris . In Paris there would be somebody a dozen names and faces trailed through her mind somebody to **28;3448;TOOLONG across his knees , roared up in the company jeep . Before either of them jumped out Fife knew by the look on their faces what they were coming back to say . Fife realized then that the hollow echoing he was hearing was not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumps of his own heart perched beneath his swallowing mechanism . Reluctance and anticipation pulled him excitedly in two directions . If his excitement got the least bit stronger , he was afraid it might turn to open fear , perhaps uncontrollable . Fife had been a bystander at the conferences over the submachinegunraid only a few days before . He had not yet forgiven Welsh for that . He had wanted one of those guns , and to go on that raid , so badly that it made his face twist into a gargoyle mask whenever he thought about it . He had even broken his solemn promise to himself never to ask Welsh for anything . He had asked Welsh outright . During a lull , of course ; when nobody else was around to hear . He did n't even ask for a gun . All he wanted was to go along . The darkbrowed sergeant had merely stared at him  --  stared with a deliberately feigned astonishment , while his black eyes kindled murderously . " Kid , " he said ; " I want that sickbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That was all . Fife did not think he would forget the shame of it during the rest of his life . He did not believe even the terrible demands of combat could erase this brand . The thought of it made his flesh itch , still . During those two days while the event of major importance which was the gun raid was happening to the company , something of minor importance had happened to Fife . He had been visited by his second friend  --  second counting Bell , that is , Fife 's other friend . Though lately Fife was about ready to give up and stop counting Bell . This second friend of Fife 's was a man named Witt , and he had been transferred out of the company two months before the outfit sailed . This man Witt was a small , thin , Breathitt County Kentucky boy , an old Regular , a former Regimental boxer . He had been in C-forCharlieseveral years . His transfer had been a fine object lesson to Fife , an interesting study of the ways in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into what was officiallycalled Final Training Phase , a new company had been created in the Regiment . Existing first on paper as a directive from the War Department , and dreamed up for reasons largely technical and uninteresting to anyone not a student of tactics , this new unit was called the Cannon Company . There already was an Anti-Tank Company . But in addition to using its new type guns as antitank defense , Cannon Company was to be able to elevate them for use as artillery , and was to serve as a tiny artillery force within the Regiment , capable of putting heavy fire down quickly onto targets of platoon-or company-size . Admirably conceived on paper , and existing only on paper , men were still needed to make Cannon Company an actuality . This was accomplished within the Regiment , by a strange process which might well have been named " shunting the crud . " Fife observedhow it worked . A Regimental memorandum was sent out ordering each company commander to donate a certain number of men . The commanders complied and the worst drunkards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under one roof to form Cannon Company . This command was then given to the officer in the Regiment whom the Regimental Commander liked least . Witt was one of the men donated by C-for-Charlie . Witt , though a drunkard ( like most ) , was not one of the worst drunkards , and neither was he a homosexual . He could perhaps , by a loose application , be classed as a troublemaker  --  since he had been busted several times and twice had gone to the stockade on a Summary Court Martial . All this made him something of a romantichero to Fife ( though perhaps not on a level with Bell ) but it did not endear him to Stein or Welsh . Still , he was not unique , and other men who were not sent to Cannon Company had had similar careers . Witt 's trouble was that he had earned the personal enmity of Welsh by arguing back , because he did not like Welsh . Welsh did not like him , either . In fact , each thought the other stank , totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to go and ask to stay , Witt was unhappy at being transferred . All his friends were in C-for-Charlie , and he liked the reputation he had there . As Witt saw it , everybody knewp102he loved C-for-Charlie and for Welsh to transfer him out while knowing this only proved his total contempt for Welsh correct , thus making it even more impossible for him to ask to stay . So he was transferred in silence , along with several real drunkards , and two homosexuals . And now he had come back for a visit . Cannon Company along with other elements of the Regiment had arrived almost a month earlier with the first echelon of the Division . They had had a good deal more time to become " acclimatized , " and Witt now had malaria . He looked wan and there was a yellowish tinge to his skin . Never heavy , he was now even thinner . He had kept his ears open for news of the old company and whenevera transport arrived with troops had tried to find them . He must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewarded . He had been on the beach with a work detail the day they arrived , but had missed them because he was up at the other end unloading the other ship . So he had started out to find them . It was harder than it sounded . The island was jammed to boiling with men and materiel . After persistent inquiry he finally found someone who knew where they were bivouacked  --  only to find when he arrived ( after slipping off and going AWOL and making the long walk up the island ) that they had moved . He had had to start the whole thing over again . The feat was indicative of Witt 's stubborn patience . It was a quality Fife wished he had more of himself . Fife was overjoyed to see him , especially after the downhill route his friendship with Bell had taken lately . Also , Fife was not unaware that  --  for another reason  --  Witt admired him as much as he admired Witt . Fife admired and heroized Witt for all of the manly , tough , brave qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . Fife was not above playing to this flattery . As it happened , Witt showed up on the very afternoon of the gun raid . Fife had , only just a short time before , stood and watched the seven raiders depart without him . Perhaps that had something to do with what happened between him and Witt , afterward . At any rate , it was a half hour after his sour observation of the raiders ' departure that he went outside for a break and heard himself hailed by a man standing some distance off near the supply tent and leaning against a cocopalm . It was Witt , who had made up hisp103mind not to come near the orderly tent where his archenemy Welsh would be , and so had decided to wait here until his friend came out . Fife could n't make out who it was at the distance . He went over to him . " Well , Witt ! By God ! How are you ! Christ , it 's good to see you ! " he cried as soon as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned , not without some triumph , in his taciturn way . But he looked tired and worn . " Hi , Fife . " For Fife , on this miserable disease- and death-ridden , frightening island , it was like finding a longlost brother . Witt allowed himself to be pumped by the hand and pounded on the back , grinning triumphantly all the while . Then they went off and sat down some distance away on a downed cocopalm log . Mostly , Witt wanted to know about the company , and when it was going up on the line . He had seen Big Queen , and Gooch , his special pal , and Storm ( who fixed him some hot Spam sandwiches , for the lunch he 'd missed ) and some of the others he used to know . But while he was happy to see them all , still nobody could tell him anything about the company . He thought perhaps Fife could . Though he was glad to see him , too , of course , naturally . He had , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have left without seeing him . " But are n't you AWOL ? " Witt shrugged , and flashed his shy  --  but proud  --  grin . " They wo n't do nothin to me . Not in that stinking outfit . " " But why did n't you come on in and get me ? " Witt 's face hardened , almost as though someone had modeled his features in quicksetting cement and Fife was watching it dry . His eyes took on a curiously flattened , deadly look  --  with which he stared at Fife . " I ai nt goin noplace where that fucking , poorly son of a bitch is . " Fife suffered a trace of spinechill . There was something oddly snakelike about Witt at certain times such as this  --  like a coiled rattler ready to strike and certain it is right and , although this was only instinct , or perhaps because of that , completely satisfied in its own tiny mind . You know it is useless to argue with it . Also  --  be/cause Witt was staring at him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulted by his suggesting Witt might be willing to go where Welsh was . This made him uncomfortable . " Yes , well , " he said . He shifted on the log . " Well , you know , I think maybe he 's changed some , Witt . Since we got here . " He did not really believe this . " That son of a bitch ai nt never going to change . Not in no way , " Witt stated . Fife believed he was right . Anyway , he could never argue with statements . " Well , I tell you . It just wo n't be the same old company , Witt , " he explained . " Going up there without you in it . It just wo n't , that 's all . I wish you were goin with us . " He fidgeted on the log . " And I guess that 's why I said that . " He essayed a pleasantry he did not entirely feel . " How 's the old shootin arm ? " Witt was a crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you . When I think of old C-for-Charlie goin up there into them Japs without me , it like to breaks my heart . I mean it . " His eyes became all right again as he leaned forward to talk seriously . " I been in this compnywhatnow ?  --  four years . You know how I feel about this compny . Everybody does . It 's my compny . It ai nt right , that 's all . It ai nt . Why , who knows how many of the guys , how many of my old buddies , I might save if I was there . I belong with the compny , Fife , old buddy . " Suddenly he slumped back on the log , his say said , his face morose . " And I do n't know what I can do about it . In fact , there ai nt a fucking damn thing I can do . " " Well , " Fife said cautiously , " I think if you went around to Stein and told him how you feel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bugger knows how good a soldier you are . It never was a question of that . And right now he 's feeling pretty warm and sentimental about the compny , you know , leading them into combat and all . " Witt was leaning forward again , his eyes shy and warm as he listened eagerly . But when Fife stopped he sat up straight and his face stiffened again . 1 " I cai n't do that , " he said . " Why not ? " " Because I cai n't . And you know it . "  | " I honestly think he 'll take you back , " Fife hazarded , cautiously . Witt 's face darkened , and undischarged lightnings flickered in his eyeballs . " Take me back ! Take me back ! They never should of made me go ! It 's their fault , it ai nt mine ! " The storm receded , passingaway inward . But the cloud , sullen and dark , remained . " No . I cai n't do that . I wo n't go to them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as uncomfortable . Witt had a habit of making you feel that way  --  without ever meaning to , of course . " Well  --  " he began . Witt interrupted . "  --  But I want you to know how much I appreciateyou tryin to help . " He smiled warmly . " Yeh . " " I mean it , " Witt said urgently . " I know you do . " There was always this fear of disagreeing with Witt , for fear you might make him mad . " What I was about to say was this . Just how bad do you want to get back into the compny ? " " You know how bad . " " Well , the only way you 're going to do it is to go to Stein and ask him . " " You know I ca n't do that . " " Well , God damn it , " Fife shouted , " that 's the only way you 'll ever get back in ! And you might as well face it ! " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ! " Witt shouted back . Fife was tired of it . Here it was the first time he had seen him in months . Also , he could not help thinking about his own encounter with Welsh , and of the seven departing raiders . But mostly it was just general irritation . " Then I guess you 'll just have to stay out , wo n't you ? " he said , thinly and in a provoking way . " I guess I will , " Witt said , glowering . Fife stared at him . Witt was not looking at him , but was staring moodily at the ground . Somberly , he cracked his knuckles one by one . " I tell you it ai nt fair , " Witt said looking up . " It ai nt fair , and it ai nt square . Any way you look at it . It ai nt justice . It 's a tra-versty of justice . " " It 's travesty , " Fife said precisely . He knew how careful Witt wasp106of his words . Witt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself by working crosswords . But Fife was irritated . " Tra-ves-ty , " he repeated , as if teaching a child . " What ? " Witt was staring at him disbelievingly . He had been still thinking about his martyrdom . " I said you pronounce it tra-ves-ty . " Anyway , he had an ace in his sleeve . He knew Witt would not hit him . Witt would not hit a friend without giving him one free warning . It was against his goddamned , stupid Kentucky code . But if he did not expect to get hit , Fife was astonished by the reaction he did get . Witt was staring at him as if he had never seen him before . The storm cloud with its flickers of impending electrical discharge had come back on his face . " Take off ! " he barked . Now it was Fife 's turn to ask : " What ? " " I said take off ! Leave ! Get out ! Go away from here ! " " Shit . I got as much right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled . Witt did not move . But it was more ominous than if he had . Calm murderousness flamed in his face . " Fife , I never hit a friend before in my life . Not without givin them fair warnin they ai nt friends no more . I do n't want to start now , either . But I will . If you do n't take off right now and go , I 'll beat the livin hell out of you . " Fife attempted to protest . " But what the hell kind of talk is that ? What the hell did I do ? " " Just go . llo n't talk . You and me ai nt friends any more . I do nt want to talk to you , I do nt want to see you . If you even try to talk to nie after this , I 'll knock you down . Without a word . " Fife got up from the log , still startled and stunned , still confused . " But , Christ , for God 's sake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Take off ! " " Okay , I 'll go . I do n't stand a chance with you in a fight and you know it . Even if I am bigger than you . " " That 's tough . But that 's life , " Witt said . " I said , go ! " " I 'm going . But you 're crazy , for God 's sake . I was kidding youp107a little . " He walked off a few steps . He could not quite make up his mind whether he was being cowardly or not , whether it was more manly to go back and stand on pride and get beaten up . After a few more steps he stopped and turned back . " Just remember the only way you 'll ever get back in the compny is like I told you . " " Take off ! " Fife did . He was still unsure whether he was acting cowardly or not . He thought maybe he was . He felt guilty about that . He felt guilty about something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say exactly what it was . He was willing to accept that Witt was right and that he had done something terribly mean , vicious and insulting , something destructive to Witt 's manhood . At any rate , he felt as he had when he was a child and had done something he knew was terribly wrong . General guilt loomed over him like a mustardcolored cloud . Halfway to the camp he stopped again and looked back . Witt was still sitting on the downed coconut tree log . " Go on ! Beat it ! " The words came to Fife faintly . He went on . At the door of the orderly tent he stopped and looked back again . Witt was gone , nowhere to be seen . Now he had lost his other friend , as well as Bell  --  to whom he must have done something also , although despite his guilt for that too , he could not figure out what it was . Two real friends , Fife thought , out of all these guys  --  and now he had lost them both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left now was Welsh . And that was something , was n't it ? He brooded about it , about Witt , trying to construct in his mind other ways it might have ended , for several days  --  every day , in fact , up to the day that he sat outside the tent on a watercan and looked across the strapped-down windshield at Stein and his driver , and knew what they were coming back to say . And it was essentially a friendless Fife who watched them clamber out and come toward him  --  which was no way to be to receive the news t hey brought . " Corporal Fife , " Stein said briskly . He was being formal , offi/cial and efficient today . As well he might be , Fife thought , considering the news . " Yes , sir ? " Fife tried to make his voice smooth and unshaky . " I want every officer and platoon grade noncom who is n't out on a detail here in five minutes . Get them all . Do nt miss anybody . Get Bead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breath down into his chest deeply . " We 're moving out , Fife . We 're moving out for the line . We leave this time tomorrow . In twenty-four hours . " Behind him the driver was nodding his head at Fife vigorously in a nervous , or perhaps sad confirmation.  |p109ALONG  THE ROUTE OF MARCH THE ARTERIES OF runny mud were clotted with stalled trucks . All faced in the direction of the march . Sometimes two or three or four were lined up one behind the other . Most were abandoned , sitting silent in the mud , waiting for the big tractors to come haul them out . Now and then there was one which had a knot of men around it who still struggled with it hopelessly , swarming kneedeep in the black soup . All of them were loaded with either the wirebound cases of C ration , threehandled jerrycans of water or brown chests of smallarmsammo , cases of grenades , or the clusters of black cardboard tubes containing mortar shells . Obviously supply by the big trucks was failing , or had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud rolls and mosquito-laden hummocks along the edges . The stalled trucks were no problem to them . Loaded down with full packs and extra bandoliers , they could n't have waded out to them if they had tried . Each company marched in a ragged single file , strung out to its fullest length , at one place bunched up to the point of having to stand still , at another spread out so that the gasping men must run to catch up . In the heavy sun the heat and humidity bore down on them , leaving them sweatdrenched , with stinging eyes , and gasping for air where there seemed only to be moisture . In some ways it was not unlike a gala , allout , holiday parade.  |p110As  far as the eye could see in both directions the two lines of overladen overheated greenclad men picked and stumbled their way along the edges of the river of mud . A Fourth of July excitement spread electric tentacles everywhere . Working parties , when they paused to ease their muscles , looked always toward the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch , and stood in clusters in the edge of the coconut trees , talking . Only a very few , possessors of more brass than the majority of men , venturedout to stare more closely . These marked the individual faces of the gasping marchers , as if wanting to memorize them . But except for the ghouls there was a curious respectfulness . Occasionally , rarely , some watcher would call out an encouragement . His answer , if he got any at all , would be a half wave of a hand , or a quick dark look and a forced grin . The marchers needed every spark of concentration they possessed simply to keep going . Any thoughts beyond that remained their own . After an hour 's marching , even such private thoughts were displaced . The infantry forgot where it was going in the urgent immediate problem of getting there , of keeping going without dropping out . Not all solved it . Slowly a new line was forming on each side , between the watchers and the road . Suddenly a marching man would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall down . Others simply fainted . These were generally dragged aside by the men behind them . Sometimes the already exhausted pulled them over . Almost always all of this was done in silence . Once in a while some still-marching man might call out hopefully to a beaten friend . But that was all . The watchers in the halfshade of the trees did not offer to help . And the stricken themselves seemed to prefer it that way . Few even attempted to crawl into the shade . They simply sat , dulleyed and lolling back in their packs as if sitting in armchairs ; or lay in their packs on their sides facedown ; or , if they were able to shuck out of their packs , stretched flat on their backs with fluttering eyelids . C-for-Charlie Company 's march was one of seven and a half miles . At eleven in the morning , with a last look back at the slit trenches , kitchen fly and tied-down storage tents which served them as home , they moved out for the road edge to await a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their assigned guide point at seven/thirty and nearly dusk , half dead , and by eight were encamped there in the jungle beside the road . Over forty-five percent of them had fallen out ; and the last of the stragglers , heat prostrations and breakfast vomiters did not cease coming in till after midnight . It was an incredible march . No one in C-for-Charlie , including the old timers who had hiked in Panama and the Philippines , had ever experienced anything like it . Early in the morning Bugger Stein had had hopes  --  had dreamed  --  of bringing his company in full strength without a man missing ; of being able to go up to the battalion commander and report to him that he for one was all present and accounted for . When the head of the column , with Stein still shakily in the lead , turned in off the road , Stein could only laugh at himself bitterly . Tired and shaky and still sweating after checking the platoon areas , he walked alone along the road to the battalion CP further up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a strange hystericky encounter with his clerk Fife on the march . It had upset Stein , then had made him hotly furious with injured ego . Now it colored his blue mood as he walked along the road in the gathering twilight . The whole thing was strange . To take eight and a half hours to march seven and a half miles was strange enough . Add to that the terrain and it was stranger still : that march through the coconut groves with those people standing around watching like a bunch of frustrated gravediggers : after that striking the Trail and marching inland always between two crowding , gloomgreen , bird-chattering walls of jungle . They had been marching almost six hours by then , and everyone was near-hysterical . At the front of the column four of the cook force had already fallen out , and two of the company headquarters : little Bead and a new man , a draftee named Weld who because of his age had been attached to the headquarters group as a sort of combinationrunner and assistant clerk . All these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piercing , ironic whistles which seemed specifically directed at the marchers . Fife had been complaining for some time in a gasping , painful , wildly emotional voice that he did n't think he could go on . Then ,  |p112after  a ten break , he had not gotten up right away with the rest . Stein had turned to him thinking to help , to encourage . " Up you come , Fife . Come on , boy . You do nt want to give up now . Not after you 've made it this far . On those poor old aching feet . " The reaction he got was startling . Fife did not get up . He leaped up . As if stabbed in the ass with a needle . On quivering legs , quiveringall over , he broke out in a mad fit of rage and abuse . " You ! You tell me ! Whadda you tell me ! I 'll be walking when you 're on your back ! I 'll be going when you and all these other guys  --  " his head described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ! You and any other goddamned officer ! " With trembling fingers he was getting back into his pack . " Shut up , Fife ! " Stein had said sharply . " Any goddamned fucking officer in the world ! I 'll walk till I drop dead  --  and when I do , I 'll be ten feet in front of your dead body ! Do n't you ever worry about me quitting ! " There had been more of this sort of talk . Staggering in his pack , Fife had lurched out onto the edge of the road . He did not shut up . Stein had not known what to do . It was up to him to make an issue or not make one . Fife was past the point of caring . Stein knew the theory of slapping an hysterical man back into his senses , but he had never actually done it himself . He was a little hesitant to try it , fearing that somehow it might not work . Or of course he could have put him under arrest and charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do neither . In silence he walked to his place at the head of the column and raised his arm and the company moved out . They were marching in two lines now , here on this narrower road in the jungle , one line on either side . Two files behind him Stein could hear Fife as he continued to curse and rage . Nobody else seemed to care , or paid much attention , they were all too tired . But Stein could not be sure he had not lost face with his company by deciding to ignore Fife . This tormented him and inside his helmet his ears burned . He maintained his silence . After a while Fife ceased of himself . The column marched in silence . On the other side out of the corner of his eye Stein could see Sergeantp113Welsh . ( He had sent Band to the rear to try to cut down the straggling . ) Welsh marched along with his head down , communing with some element of himself , and looking as though he were out for a walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent gargles from his Listerine bottle of gin , which infuriated Stein . As if Welsh was fooling anybody . At the side of the road in the thick leaves , almost in Stein 's ear , some mad tropic bird screamed at them irritably , then whistled shrilly as though it had seen a woman . His anger when it came on him , marching , had not come until some little time after Fife subsided . But when it came it was potent . His neck swelled and his whole head burned inside his helmet . He was so furiously angry it blurred his eyes until he feared he would trip and fall down and lie there and howl senselessly . He hated them , all of them . You break your ass trying to look after them , be a father to them . And all they do is hate you for it , and for being an officer , with a hard , ignorant , stubborn endurance . Fife had not fallen out . Stein continued along the twilit road . He was sunk in a morose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he carried a certain guilt about Fife . He had always had rather mixed feelings about him . That he was an intelligent boy he had no doubt . And he had made him corporal nine months back because of this , and because he did his work well  --  even though this meant an assistant squad leader had to remain a Pfc . In addition to this , Stein had allowed Fife two mornings a week off to attend some courses at the university in the town where the division was stationed , when the new law giving free tuition to servicemen first came out . He liked the boy . ( And he thought he had proved that . ) But he could not help feeling Fife was emotionally unstable . He was flighty , and inclined to be overimaginative . Highly emotional , he lacked the ability to control his emotions which might have given him good judgment . Of course he was still only a boy . But after all he was twenty . Stein did not know his background in detail , but he felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition ; suchlike ) Fife had become a case of arrested adolescence . There were so many like that in America today . In the Civil War men of twenty had led regiments , even divisions . In practicep114in the company none of this made any difference . The boy did his work and except for an occasional angry flare-up at Welsh ( for which nobody could be blamed ! ) kept his mouth shut . But it was because of all this that Stein had felt he could not wholeheartedly recommendFife for Officers ' Candidate School . Back when War Dcpartrnent was deep in its campaign to get talent entered in the ninety-day OCS , Stein had encouraged a numberof his high school graduates and more intelligent noncoms to apply . Almost all were accepted and all but two graduated with commissions . One day in the orderly room , in a moment of inspirationcoupled to a misdirected desire to do good works , he had suggested to Fife that Fife apply for the Administrative School  --  as distinct from the Infantry School , because given Fife 's personality as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a good infantryofficer . Fife 's first reaction was to balk and refuse ; and Stein should have left it at that . But to Stein it was obvious that Fife was imitating his hero Welsh who , whenever he was approached about OCS , merely snorted and looked as though he were going to spit on the floor . So later Stein tried again ; because he felt it was for the good of the Army , as well as Fife . The second time was what tore it . It still made Stein angry to think about it . The second time he was asked Fife said he had changed his mind , that he would apply , but that he would not apply to the Administrative School ; if he was going to be an officer at all , he said with some highly tragic emotionality Stein did not clearly understand , he wanted to be an infantry combat officer . Stein did not know what to do . He did not want to come out and tell Fife to his face he did n't believe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position he had got himself in by trying to do good works , to help the Army and Fife . In the end he helped Fife fill out his application and signed it and sent it in . After all , every soldier had a legal right to apply . But Stein did not feel he himself had any moral right to be dishonestin his recommendation . He sent in his character analysis of Fife and his honest opinion , which was that he did not think Fife would make a good infantry officer . It was the only thing he could see to do.  |p115The  application came back immediately . To it was affixed a note from the Regimental S-i saying : What the hell ? Do n't give me all this Pro and Con crap , Jim . If you do n't think a soldier will make a good Officer , why the hell send me his application ? I got more papers than I can take care of now . Stein was again angered , as well as embarrassed , this time . If the son of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buddy at the club , did n't know every soldier had a legal right to apply , he was stupid ; and if he did know it , he was immoral . Once again Stein was placed in the position of not knowing what to do . He filed the application away without mentioning it to Fife , and once again tried to get him to apply for the Administrative School . Fife refused . He said he preferred to wait until he heard from the first one , and that was what he proceeded to do : wait , angering Stein yet again . The worst of it all was that Fife found the application , with Stein 's character analysis of him , and the S-i 's note . Two weeks before they were to leave they cleaned out all their papers . Fife , cleaning out Stein 's personal files , found it in a bunch of other papers . Stein , sitting at his desk , had reached out and grabbed it , saying it was something of his , and had locked it away . But not before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to run through it . At any rate Fife had looked at him with a very odd look on his face . As usual Welsh was there grinning , missing nothing . But then , with another of those high  --  and usually tragic  --  emotionalities which Stein could never fully understand though he could sense them , Fife went on with his work and said nothing . And he had not said anything , from that day to this . Had never mentioned it . But of course it did n't take any great feat of brainwork to know that this was basically what was behind his outburst of today . The enlisted man 's viewpoint ! It was this unfairness which angered and so infuriated Stein . Now , though , he felt only blue . It was always a shock to rediscoverhow much enlisted men hated you , because you tended to try to forget it . And tomorrow he would be taking them in . He felt very inadequate . Especially when he recalled how badly the march had gone today . He had been horrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers or platoon sergeants had fallenp116out on him . They knew better than to . But when Stein thought about the number of big , tough men in his outfit who had given up , or for that matter simply fainted dead away , it left him with a dark foreboding for the future . When an undermuscled , essentially puny man like himself could keep going and these guys could not , it did not speak well for the conditioning of his company , physical or mental . IIe had tried to do the best he could by them in training , God knew . Great God , what would the heat and exhaustion and tension of combat itself do to them ! He did not , of course , when he reported , say anything to the battalion commander about any of this ; and when he did report , he discovered to his surprise that his forty-five percent straggling was in fact the best mark made in the battalion . It did not make him feel any better . He accepted the battalion commander 's rather sour congratulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkening road looking slowly and with thoughtful care at the tall trees and fat-leafed jungle undergrowth . With a flashlight Stein held a briefing for his officers and platoon sergeants in front of his little sleeping tent . It made his heart feel funny in his chest to be doing it . First Battalion would be in reserve most of the morning unless called . In the afternoon they would move forward to take over the positions on the hills which 2d Battalion was supposed by then to have gained . In the reflected glow of the flash on the map Stein studied their faces . Welsh was there of course , but the clerk Fife who should have been on hand in case Stein needed him , was nowhere to be seen . Probably he was embarrassed . Well , it did n't matter . He did n't need him . And there was no tactical reason why Fife should hear the dispositions . Stragglers were still coming in . Stein had already resigned himself to the fact that he was not going to get much sleep tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefing was because he had gone for a walk in the jungle . It had nothing to do with embarrassment . Not only was Fife not embarrassed by his outburst of the afternoon , he was rather proud of it . He had not thought he was that brave . And the reason he had gone for a walk in the jungle alone had to do with the fact that , having pleased and surprised himself with his own courage like that , he had then discovered that it was all meaningless anyway.  |p117When  compared to the fact that he might very well be dead by this time tomorrow , whether he was courageous or not today was , pointless , empty . When compared to the fact that he might be dead tomorrow , everything was pointless . Life was pointless . Whether he looked at a tree or not was pointless . It just did n't make any difference . It was pointless to the tree , it was pointless to every man in his outfit , pointless to everybody in the whole world . Who cared ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead , when he ceased to exist , it would be pointless to him too . More important : Not only would it be pointless , it would have been pointless , all along . This was an obscure and rather difficult point to grasp . Understandingof it kept slipping in and out on the edges of his mind . It flickered , changing its time sense and tenses . At those moments when he understood it , it left him with a very hollow feeling . Because from somewhere down in the lowest bottom of his mind there had risen a certain , sure knowledge that tomorrow , or at least within the next few days , he would be dead . This had filled Fife with such a huge sadness that he forgot all about the dispositions conference and simply walked off by himself , into the jungle to look at all the things which would continue to exist after he had ceased to . There were a lot of them . Fife looked at them all . They remained singularly unchanged by his scrutiny . It really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did anything . Fife did not believe in God . He did not disbelieve in God . It was just that it was a problem which did not apply to him . So he could not believe he was fighting this war for God . And he did not believe he was fighting it for freedom , or democracy , or the dignity of the human race . When he analyzed it , as he tried to do now , he could find only one reason why he was here , and that was because he would be ashamed for people to think he was a coward , embarrassed to be put to jail . That was the truth . Why it was the truth , when he had already proved to himself that it made no difference what he did or whether he did anything , he could not say . It was just the fact . Fife had unslung his rifle when he left the camp , because they had been warned there might be Japanese infiltrators this close to the front . He had not seen anything move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to get a little bit edgy . He knew this ground had been fought over only a week ago , but from the look of it he might have been the first man ever to set foot here . And yet some man , another American , might have been killed here where he himself now stood . Fife tried to imagine it . He gripped his rifle tighter . The eerie stillness of the jungle thickened around him as the daylight failed . Quite suddenly Fife remembered they would be posting sentries around the camp tonight . Hell , he might get shot by some triggerhappy sentry . Without waiting longer , and forgettingabout his conviction that he would be dead soon so that nothing mattered , he turned and started legging it back to camp , glad to be returning to the presence of his own breed . The sentries had not yet been posted . The sergeant in charge of the guard was just rounding them up . Fife stared at them a moment wildly , as if they were not real , thinking how narrowly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish emotionalism , then reported to Stein 's sleeping tent . There he was told by Welsh , who was preparing to bed down nearby , to take the hell off and go to bed . For a moment , just for a moment , Fife thought of asking him for something , some assurance . He wanted to . But then he realized he did not know what to ask him for , or how to phrase what he wanted to say , or even what that was . After all , what assurance could be given ? He did n't want anyone to think he was a nervous sissy , or a coward . So instead of speaking , he shrugged elaborately at Welsh , though feeling that his lace did not look right , looked too scared , and turned and walked away . Welsh , who was sitting crosslegged in front of his tent with his rifle across his knees , stared after him with crinkled eyes until the boy limped from sight around a tree . From beneath the black brows the eyes themselves glinted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world . Welsh sniffed . Taken him long enough . It . was a concept any intelligent child ought to understand readily . Only , they just did n't like to . So now he was learning it the hard way . Hurts , do n't it . Scares you a little bit , hunh . Shock to the system . Make anybody constipated . In a way Welsh sympathized with him . But there was nothing he could do about it . Nor any/body else . Except advise him to go back and get born dumb . Property , kid ; all for property . Everybody dies ; and what 's it all about ? In the end , what 's everything about ? What remains ? Property . Welsh went back to cleaning and checking his rifle . He had already gone over his new Thompsongun and the pistol he had pre-empted from MacTae 's supply room . And if they had handed out sawed-off shotguns , he would have had one of those . He had to hurry with the rifle , it was almost too dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and sighted along it off through the trees . Give him the Garand anytime . Let the romantic kids have the Springfields and spotweld BAR clips on them . The Marines had to do that . He 'd take the Garand . Give him the firepower , and you could keep your pinpoint accuracy . This was going to be the age of firepower , not accuracy . Welsh dropped the rifle back onto his thighs and dangled his hands from his knees . He wished he had something to fuck tonight . A goat would do . Or a clean old man . Crosslegged , his rifle across his lap , Welsh sat and stared off into the dark trees . Fife did not sleep much either . But it was for a different reason than either Stein or Welsh . When he left Welsh , he hunted up a ration stack . His conviction that he would be dead tomorrow or the day after did not stop hunger . He ate a cold can of C ration Meat &; Beans sitting on the ground outside his tent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he crawled in and lay down , his heart pounding when he suddenly thought about tomorrow . Die ? Why , he had never seen Nice and Monte Carlo . It was twenty minutes after this that little Bead , who had fallen out on the march today , came crawling in . Fife had seen him earlier , down by the first platoon , visiting some kid draftee friend of his . When he heard him now , he rolled over with his face to the wall and pretended to be asleep . Bead scrambled in under the net without a word , and turned to his own side ignoring Fife in return . They lay like that for a long time , in silence , while the camp settled down around them . Then they lay for an even longer time in the quiet that followed . The air in the tent was stiff with pretendedsleep . Finally Bead moved . He rolled over and said in a hoarse voice :  | " Well , what about it ? " Fife made no answer , and continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what about it ? " Bead said again finally , more harshly . Fife did not answer. " 1 do n't see that either one of us 's got anything to lose . Not by now . And it aright be the last time of anything for both of us . " Bead 's voice was hoarse , as though it were being pulled out of him , and was not without a bitter undercurrent . His breathing was loud in the tent . Fife still did not answer or move , and Bead said nothing further . He had rolled over and was now facing Fife 's back . He did not roll back . His breathing continued loud . " I got one on , and you do too , " little Bead from Iowa said finally , with a kind of fierce honesty . It was true . In a way that was answer enough . Slowly Fife rolled over toward him . They were now lying face to face , about a foot between them . Fife could just barely make out Bead 's face in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect the meager light and illuminate his face with it . " Well ? " Bead said . " Well what ? " Fife said irascibly . " One of us has got to turn end for end . " What the hell ? Bead had brought it up , let him do the turning . There was a rustle and Bead 's face disappeared from in front of him . Fife waited . Thoughtfully he ran his tongue over his unbrushed teeth . First Bead 's shoes , then his knees , appeared in front of his face . Curiously enough , Fife during the next minutes was thinking about his girlfriend at the university in town whom he had never been able to seduce , remembering her vividly , almost physically . She was a large girl with heavy breasts , big thighs , muscular buttocks , and a protuberant nrons Veneris , all of which he had felt through her clothes just once one passionate night , but never had seen . He had not been able to seduce her , but he had received four fervid love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had answered two , with appropriately tragic letters for a young infantryman about to die soon , but after the third the effort was too painful . It was easy for her to write that she now regretted shep121had not given herself to him when she had the chance ; but for Fife to read it was almost unbearable . And long-range sympathy gained him nothing . Still , on occasion he liked to remember the way she had felt , through her clothes , better , richer , juicier , than any whore he had ever been to bed with . Fife did not , on the other hand , like to remember how this business with Bead had got started . But there were times , like tonight , when he could not avoid it . It had started the second night on the island , in fact . The first night was the night of the day it rained so hard , also the first they had ever bunked together in a sheltertent . The second night was much drier ; more comfortable . Bugger Stein still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bead who broached the subject . He had come crawling in at a moment when Fife , already disrobed to his underwear , had been thinking ardently about girls . Fife was embarrassed , but Bead made no comment . However while he undressed he began to complain about what a hardship it was for him to be where he was denied the services of women . They had often been on pass together , Fife and he , and had gone up to the whorehouses together in the town where the divisionwas stationed , and had Fife not noticed it ? Well , he was a very horny type , little Bead said , and he needed lots of sex . At eighteen this may well have been true ; and Bead had stated it many times before ; but Fife could not help feeling Bead perhaps bragged a little . Anyway , for Bead , the worst thing about this whole war was that , he said . And what the hell could a guy do ? Nothing , that was what . Beat it . Or do without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was either that , or find yourself a queer cook or baker someplace , or it was nothing . Guys could help each other out , Bead supposed . " You know , like the things you used to do together when you were kids in school , " he grinned , shyly . That was all he said . He had finished undressing down to his shorts . Then he lay down on his own side of the tent , and went on talking about girls and whores in that almost childish tenor which at eighteen he had not yet lost . Finally he stopped the talking also . There was a long pause . Then he rolled over to face Fife.  | " Well , what do you say ? " he said cheerfully . " Shall we help each other out ? I 'll do it to you if you 'll do it to me . " Fife had divined what was coming . Nevertheless he pretended surprise and confusion . But he already knew that he was going to accept . And Bead , finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his voice and in his salesmanship . Apparently it made no difference to him and did not worry him that he was suggesting something homosexual . And perhaps , being eighteen and just out of school , he did n't see it that way . But that could not be entirely true , Fife speculated later , because as he started to crawl over to Fife 's side of the little tent he stopped and said : " I just do nt want you to think I 'm no queer , or nothing like that . " " Well , do nt you get the idea I am , either , " Fife had answered . Fife thought about his lost girl that time , too . He thought about her every time . There were n't many more times . There was that first night , the second night on the island , and the following night which was the third night on the rock . On the fourth day the company 's tents were found , the puptents were struck , and everybodymoved into the larger eight-man tents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one single time , on an afternoon when Welsh was gone and there was no work for them to do , they had gone off for a walk in the jungle , knowing beforehand what they were going to do but not mentioning it , so that when it happened off there alone in the massive , high-arching jungle , it seemed to both of them to come as a complete surprise . But that was all , just those three times and this last one . It had of course changed their relationship . Fife to his own surprisefound himself becoming more and more authoritarian with his little assistant than he had ever dared be with anyone in his life . He gave him curt orders , cursed him out for the slightest thing , criticized him constantly , insulted him more and more frequently , used him as his perpetual butt ; in short , more and more treated Bead as he himself hated to be treated by Welsh . Bead on the other hand seemed to understand this , and moreover accepted it as though he felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fife 's insultsin silence , carried out his repeated orders as best he could ,  |p123and  received his constant criticism quietly without anger or answeringback . And yet all this time Fife was not really angry at him for anything . Bead seemed to know this . Fife knew it , too . But his reaction was an emotional response he could neither understand nor control . After Bead had gone off into a relaxed , profound sleep Fife lay wide awake staring into the darkness . He had given up trying to sort it all out . All he knew was that he did not feel guilty about what he did with Bead . He felt he ought to feel guilty . But the truth was that he did n't . After all , what was the difference between doing the same things now that you did as a kid , and doing them when you were a freshman or sophomore . Only all the talk you had heard in the meantime about fairies and queers . Fife knew there were oldtimers in the army who had their young boyfriends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return , the young soldiers received certain favors from their protectors , not the least of which was more money to spend on women in town . None of this buggering was considered homosexual by anyone and authority turned a blind eye to it . But that was buggering . On the other hand there were the overt homosexuals , much increased since the drafting of civilians , whom everybody disliked , though many might avail themselvesof their services . This was the type company commanders tried to get rid of whenever a levy of men was demanded . These two types constituted the extent of Fife 's knowledge . He could not honestly place himself among them , but was terrified that someone else might . On this night before his outfit went into its first combat he lay awake a long time , wondering whether he was a homosexual . Every now and then his heart would jump suddenly when he rememberedhe had never seen Nice or Monte Carlo . Anyway , he knew he liked girls . Almost everyone was up at dawn . At the very first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men began crawling out , taking down their tents , rolling their packs . No orders had to be given them . Some , still afflicted with the American cleanliness complex , poured water from their canteens onto their toothbrushes to brush their teeth . Most did not . A few others remembered to powder their feet . There was very little horseplay , and a subdued air hungp124over everything in the dim green jungle light . Breakfast was a simple affair . There were C ration stacks around everywhere , and each man simply went to one of them when he felt like eating and took what he wanted . After eating , they settled down on their packs to wait . Dawn had come shortly before five o'clock . It was after eightthirtywhen an out-of-breath guide appeared with orders for them to move . While they had waited they could hear if not see other outfits moving invisibly into or out of other positions all around them in the jungle . Gasping infantry companies kept straggling past on the road . Now , led by the guide ( who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road behind a company from their own third battalion whom they recognized . They themselves knew nothing about what was happening . The guide led them half a mile in half an hour . There he stopped , and pointed to a grassy place under some trees at the roadedge . This was where they were supposed to wait . They were supposed to drop their rolls and form combat packs , sit down and wait . He turned on his heel and left , going toward the front . " But hey ! " Stein protested after him . " There must be more instructionsthan that . I know what the dispositions are . I know what we 're supposed to do . " " I do nt know nothin about none of that , sir , " the guide called back . " All I know I was suppose to bring you here and tell you what I tole you . " " But wo n't they send another runner for us ? " " I reckon they will . I do nt know . All I know is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , but I got to get back up there . " He turned and went on , disappeared around a bend in the road . It was as though C-for-Charlie Company suddenly had dropped completely out of the world . With the disappearance of the guide they did not see another living soul . There had been companies marching both in front of and behind them . Now there were none . The one in front had gone on , the one behind evidently some other way . There had been jeeps loaded with supplies bucking through the mud . There was now nothing , not a vehicle . The road stretched before them totally deserted . And nothing came along it either . Evenp125sound seemed to have ceased . Except for the normal jungle noises , they seemed to have dropped into a vacuum ; and the only sound they could hear , one which their ears gradually became aware of , was the distant splashing and faint voices of men moving something up or down the river somewhere off behind the screen of jungle . They unslung their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They waited another hour and a half  --  from nine to tenthirty  --  before they saw another human , listening to the splashing and faint shouts from the river , staring at their neat , stacked rolls . There was not much discussion of the situation while they waited , largely because nobody knew what it was . But they did n't want to talk about it anyway , and preferred not to think about it . What little discussion there was employed a new word ; simply , " Elephant . " During the past two days whenever the group of treeless hills C-forCharlie'sregiment had been assigned to attack was mentioned , it was called The Elephant , or simply Elephant . Everyone was quick to pick the word up and use it , but nobody knew where it came from or what it meant . In actual fact , the complex of hills had been named " The Dancing Elephant " by a young staff officer while studying an aerial photograph . Outlined an all sides by dark jungled valleys , the group of grassy hills did somewhat resemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and its trunk above its head . The hind legs up to the belly were already held by the Marines , and the regiment 's attack ( less the 3d Battalion , which had been given another objective ) was to commence there and work its way up and across the rest of the group of hills to the Elephant 's Head . The Japanese had been felt out by reconnaissance and were known to hold at least two strong points in the Dancing Elephant from which it was believedthey would contest vigorously any attack . One of these was a high , steep ridge running across the Elephant 's body at about the shoulder ; the other was the Elephant 's Head itself , the highest point in the entire hill mass . From it the Elephant 's Trunk tapered down to the low jungled country , affording the Japanese a good supply route  --  and a good escape route , if they needed it . It was the high ridge at the Elephant 's Shoulder , which had been labeled Hill 209 , that the 2d Battalion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted road , C-for-Charlie had no idea if they were doing it or not , and if they were , how they were faring , and  --  except for the officers and platoon sergeants  --  did not even know the hill 's designated number . Nor did many of them very much care . John Bell was one of those who did . Bell had had enough infantry strategy and tactics to be interested generally . Besides , if his life was going to be in jeopardy because of this action , he wanted to know as much about it as he could . Anyway , sitting on this weirdly desertedroad was singularly unnerving , and Bell wanted something to do . Discussing the action was as good as anything else . Bell was in the second squad of the second platoon , which was the squad of young Sergeant McCron , the notorious motherhen . McCron was great when it came to looking after his draftee charges , but he knew next to nothing about tactics , and cared even less . Bell approached his platoon sergeant , Keck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same platoon since 1940 . Bell learned nothing from him . Keck merely sneered at him irritably and told him that 2d Battalion was attacking a hill called 209 today at some place called The Elephant ( Christ knew why ) , that beyond it was another hill called ( appropriately enough ) Hill 210 which they themselves would probably have to attack tomorrow provided 2d Battalion did not bog down today and , since they were in reservetoday , what the hell difference did it make ? All of this Bell already knew . Keck was one of those toughened field noncoms who preferred to leave the maps and planning to the officers until he himself could get on the ground and see just what little jobs his platoon would have to do . Bell appreciated this , but it did n't help him any . His own platoon officer Lieutenant Blane was sitting close by but Blanc had always been distant to Bell . Undoubtedly this was because of Bell 's former status and Bell ( lid not feel like asking Blanc . Then he saw Culp of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the typical uncomplicated happy-goluckycollege football player had always been kind to him . Bell decided to ask him . Culp appeared to be a little unnerved himself by the strangelyp127deserted road and the waiting , because he seemed glad to talk . He was able to tell Bell that some bright young staff officer ( who would probably make Lt Colonel out of his feat ) had conceived the poetic name of The Dancing Elephant , and with a stick drew him a rough map on the damp ground showing The Elephant 's salient features . When they had exhausted the topic  --  exhausted it to the point of mutual embarrassment , in fact  --  Bell went back to his squad , thinking it over . He decided there would be at least two rather nasty jobs of work in securing The Elephant . He had consumedtwenty minutes . He sat down with his squad , thinking about his wife Marty and wondering what she was doing right now . It would be night now back in Columbus . Would n't it ? Suddenly a physical desire for her , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and look at her and mount her , so strong that it made his head begin to burn with a hot fever of flushed blood , passed over him and gripped him . It was so impossibly painfulthat he thought he must scream . Almost delirious with the fever of it , he could not make it go away . Immediately afterward he had a severe chill . Bell was not so delirious that he did not know what that meant . He made the tenth man in three days . Malaria was not considered a hospitalizing ailment except in the most extreme cases , and Bell was not the only man present with beginning malaria when finally a solitary figure appeared around the bend of the still-deserted road in front of them . At the spot where they sat the road bore a slight upgrade to the bend ahead . At the bend it turned sharply downhill to the right . The figure trudged uphill around the bend breathing heavily , stopped momentarily on the level ground to breathe , then stopped a second time when he saw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man came on at a quickened pace , already shouting . " Where the fuck have you guys been ? I been lookin all over hell 's half acre for this outfit ! What the hell have you been doin ? You 're supposed to be on the other side the river , not here ! What the fuck happened ? " He continued to come on , shouting other plaintive statements . " All right , " Bugger Stein called disgustedly to his company . " Fall in , men , fall in. "  |p128The  new guide did not cease his nervous exhortation even when he came up to them and , once they had fallen in , began to lead them onward . " Honestly , sir , I been lookin all over . You 're suppose to be clear over on the other side the river . That 's where they tole me you 'd be . " " We were just exactly where the other guide left us , and told us to stay , " Stein said . All his many pieces of equipment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to be kept in time and kept knocking against each other and against himself as he walked , ruining his balance . " Then he must of made some kind of a mistake , " the new guide said . " He was very positive about what he told us , " Stein said ; " and quite definite . " " Then somebody up there gave him the wrong orders . Or else they told me wrong . " The guide thought . " But I know I 'm right . Because the rest of the battalion 's all over there . " Not a very auspicious beginning . But Stein was even more concerned with some other things . He waited a full fifteen seconds before he spoke . " What 's it like up there ? " He could not fully disguise in his voice the guilt he felt for asking . But the guide did n't notice . " It 's a  --  " he searched for a word  --  " a crazyhouse . " Stein had to be content with that . The guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stein , and they exchanged a glance . Then , suddenly , Band grinned at him a wolfishgrin . Wondering what the hell that meant , Stein put his mind on the job at hand , because they had reached the bend . From the bend the road ran almost straight down to the unnamedriver , and the slope was steep . The road itself , churned by traffic , was a mudslide , a gloomy descending tunnel between impenetrablejungle walls . The only way to take it was to turn sidewayslike a man running down steep steps , and then dig in with the sides of the feet . At least half of the company took wet pratfallsgoing down , but there was very little laughter . What laughterp129there was was highpitched and nervous , and did not sound truly sincere . The pontoon bridge , wide enough and with wood tracks for the jeeps to cross , was directly at the bottom . Groups of traffic controlmen and bridge tenders watched them from both ends of it with curious but sympathetic eyes . After their scrambling , sliding , falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time like an early Chaplin movie , their momentum carried them right on across . In crossing , they saw for the first time the cause of the splashingand faint shouting they had heard earlier . Groups of naked or nearnaked men were wading in the river pushing boats ahead of them , one line coming upstream another going down , an improvisedsupply line replacing the stalled trucks . The boats comingupstream carried supplies . And in the ones going down C-forCharliegot its first look at infantry wounded by infantry : dulleyedmen most of them , lolling against the thwarts and wrapped here and there with the startlingly clean white of bandages , through which on many the even more startling red of fresh blood had soaked . From the bridge every eye in C-for-Charlie turned toward them whitely , as the company crossed . Not all of the returning boats carried wounded men , only about half . As soon as they reached the other side they began to climb as steeply as they had come down , but the climb was longer . Many more men could be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and talking . To C-for-Charlie after an hour and a half alone the sight was comforting . They saw D-for-Dog , their battalion 's heavy weapons company , sitting all together in the jungle on the slope with their big mortars and .50 cal machineguns . There were some waves and greetings . Able and Baker had already gone up , they were told . Then they came out of the jungle onto the grassy slopes . As if there were a manmade demarkation line , the mud ceased suddenly and became hard , packed dirt which dusted their faces . They climbed on . It was here the S/Sgt Stack , platoon sergeant of the third lead platoonfor an even longer time than Keck had been sergeant of the second , a lean hardfaced tough old drillmaster and disciplinarian , was found sitting by the trail with his legs pressed tightly togetherp130and his rifle in his lap , crying in agony at them as they passed : " Do nt go up there ! you 'll be killed ! do nt go up there ! you 'll be killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one at a time and man by man in single file as if passing in some macabre review , as he sat pressing his legs and shouting at them . Most of them hardly saw or heard him in the intensity of their own excitement , and they left him there . It was as close to the front as Stack ever got , and they did not see him again . They were about two-thirds up . Nothing they heard or saw on the way up prepared them for the pandemonium they entered when they came over the crest . Climbing with the wind behind them they had heard no battle noises ; then , rounding the last bend and coming out onto the open hilltop suddenly , they found themselves immersed in infernalnoise and tumult . Like a river running into a swamp and dissipating its current , the line of files trudged over the crest and disappeared in a mob of running or standing , shouting and talking men who struggled to make themselves heard above the din . Invisible but not far off , 81mm mortars fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off came the monumentalcrashes of artillery firing sporadic salvos . Further off still .50 cal machineguns , chattering in bass voices , punctuated the intervals . And much fainter , but coming clearly across the rollingunjungled terrain in front , there were the sounds of smallarmsfire and grenades , and the explosions of the mortar shells and artillery rounds landing . All of this , compounded by the excitement , shouting and rushing about , created a demented riotous uproar whose total effect could only be mad confusion . C-forCharliehad arrived on the field , at just a few minutes after eleven . They were on a high knoll overlooking a series of grassy hills and draws rising out of the surrounding sea of jungle . To their front the slope fell to a smaller knoll upon which the jungle encroached more closely , forming in effect a narrow neck of untreedland leading to the wider areas beyond . On this knoll , too , stood or ran groups of Americans in their green combat fatigues , a lesser number than up here , thirty perhaps . Beyond the second knoll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further ,  |p131to  a broken ravine covered with sparse grass ; and beyond this low point the land rose again , steeply this time , to a high ridge which dominated the area and made invisible anything beyond it . On this slope , perhaps a thousand yards away and higher even than the original vantage point , infantrymen were fighting . To a few men like Bell who were informed about The Dancing Elephant 's terrain , it was clear that the knoll they occupied was The Elephant 's hind foot . The lower knoll in front , which was obviously 2d Battalion 's command post , thus became The Elephant 's knee leading to the wider areas ahead which formed the torso . And the high ridge where the infantrymen now fought was the Elephant 's Shoulder , the strong point labeled Hill . 209 . A fire fight was obviously in progress . Several groups of squad or platoon size , tiny at this distance but plainly visible , were trying to get close to the crest and take it . The Americans , too far down the slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content themselves with riflefire . The Japanese , also clearly visible from time to time among the trees which rose above the crest from the jungled reverse slope , were under no such handicap ; they could simply drop them down , and the black explosions from the Japanese grenades kept bursting out here and there , from the hillside . One American , receiving such a grenade near him , was seen to turn and simply jump out from the side of the hill like a man jumping off a ladder . He hit and rolled , the grenade exploded black behind him , and after a moment he rose and began to work his way back up to his group . C-for-Charlie had arrived just at the climax . As they stood in the milling mob on the knoll trying to see and taking all of this in for the first time , the several groups on the slope rose into a concerted line and rushed the crest , lobbing grenades ahead of them and firing . They got to within perhaps fifteen yards of the top before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knoll , was too much for them . They broke and began leaping and scrambling back down the hill where they went to ground as before , having left a number of their men , perhaps ten percent , behind them on the uphill slope . There were exclama/tions of dismay and a number of angry groans on the hilltop around C-for-Charlie . The chorus of groans was not the only action on the knoll as a result of the repulse . Runners and junior staff officers began to push their way out through the crowd and go various places . The center of all this activity was a small group of seven men standing together in grand isolation on the knoll 's peak . They were almost the only men present wearing any insignia , and all of them wore stars or eagles on the collars of their green fatigues . They were further distinguished from the others by their cleanliness . All of them were older men . From time to time they looked through binoculars or pointed at the terrain , talked to each other or into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would also talk into a wireless radio packed on a much younger man 's back . C-for-Charlie was able to recognize among them their battalion commander , their regimental commander and , from their photographs , their division and corps commanders . One of these men now yelled irately into one of the sound power phones . Below on the second knoll the 2d Battalion 's Colonel shouted back at him into its mate . The one above , tall and spare , listened intently , nodding his helmeted head . Then he turned to the wireless radio , looking angry and unsatisfied . Completing his call , he began to speak apologetically to three of the others who wore stars . He wore eagles . Below , the 2d Battalion 's Colonel was now speaking into still another phone in his other hand . Across the valley eight hundred yards in front of him the companyCP of the repulsed platoons was located behind the crest of a subsidiary ridge growing out of the side of the main ridge . Off to one side of this small group two smaller clusters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were the company'smortar section plying the tubes of their 60mm mortars , invisiblefrom here . As the Colonel talked , a figure detached itself from the CP group and dropped over the crest and went forward in rushes toward the groups which had been repulsed and which now were sporadically firing uphill at the Japanese . Before he reached them , he tumbled , shot . Immediately another dropped over the crest in his place . The moment this one reached them thep133groups began to withdraw along the ridge , again in rushes , firing in groups to cover each other , all the way back to the command post , where they lost no time in diving back over the crest of the subsidiary ridge . In the high-ranking group of older men on the hill , one was now waving his arms angrily and pounding himself furiously on the leg . Below , the 2d Battalion 's Colonel was doing the same thing . Seconds later artillery shells began to fall in great mushrooming clusters on the Japanese-held ridge . Whatever other manifestations occurred on the hilltop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They now were too involved in themselves and their own forthcoming part in the drama to care about watching the internationally famous command group . During the action Bugger Stein had gone over to report to his battalion commander , who was more a student observer there than an integral part of the group . Stein now returned to them . ist Battalion less D-for-Dog was ordered as regimentalreserve to occupy and hold the main ridge behind and to the left of the F-for-Fox CP which they had just been watching . The main ridge here , lower than Hill 209 on the right , had been labeled Hill 208 and formed , so to speak , The Elephant 's middle and lower spine . The Japanese had never occupied it , but there was fear of a flanking counterattack . A-for-Able and C-for-Charlie were to man the line with B-for-Baker in reserve in the ravine , Colonel Tall 's orders . Since Able and Baker were already moving down right now , this meant that C-for-Charlie would have to pass through Baker  --  always a difficult maneuver , and they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preoccupation around Bugger'seyes behind his glasses as he spoke . His own dispositions were : 1st and 2d platoons on the line , 3d in reserve ; Culp would set up his two MGs at optional points of choice along the line , Platoon , Company HQ , Weapons Platoon , 3d Platoon . They were to move out right away . In the fact , as they formed up by platoons , it was discovered that they could not move right away . Their front was being crossed by E-for-Easy , the 2d Battalion reserve . Easy was being committed to the right wing of 2d Battalion 's attack where G-for/George , invisible from here around the corner of jungle , had also bogged down . C-for-Charlie knew many Easy Company people , and some of them called greetings . But Easy Company , going to certain attack instead of to a safe defensive position , preferred to ignore them and stared at them with a mixture of nervousness and hateful envy . Slowly they plodded across and disappeared down the righthand slope of the hill into the woods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to move down the slope , 1st Platoon in the lead . It was during this fifteen minute wait that First Sergeant Welsh suddenly came to the fore . Up to now Welsh had been very carefullytaking a back seat . He had no intention of becoming conspicuousor committing himself until he knew where he stood . He had tried to prepare himself , and two of the three canteens on his belt were filled with gin . In addition , he had his Listerine bottle . He could not say exactly what the experiences of today made him feel . All Welsh knew was that he was scared shitless , and at the same time was afflicted with a choking gorge of anger that any social coercion existed in the world which could force him to be here . In addition the tremendously intense excitement on the hilltop affected him powerfully . It was not unlike the feeling in a stadium generated by a crowd rooting at an important college football game . It was this outrageous comparison which gave him the idea to do what he did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past their front , Welsh spied a whole stack of unopened handgrenadecases on the edge of the hill , and simultaneously realized somebody had fucked up somewhere along the line in not issuing grenades to C-for-Charlie . Grinning his sly , mad grin , he decided to issue them himself . But in such a way that the cheeringsection emotionaltenor of the day should be properly honored . Without so much as a word to anyone , he suddenly crouched with his palms on his knees and at the top of his command voice bellowed : " Hup ! Twenty-six , thirty-two , forty-three ; hike ! " , whirled like a halfback , and ran over to the stack of cases drawing his bayonet and began splitting the soft pine cases open through the middle . The grenades inside were in black cardboard cylinders , their halves held togetherp135with yellow tape . Welsh began to draw them out and to bellow . " Eggs ! Fresh eggs ! Nice fresh yard eggs ! Who wants eggs ! " The enormous , booming command voice was easily heard despite the racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn and look . Then hands began to shoot up out of the crowd . And Welsh , still bellowing , and still grinning crazily , began to forward pass the canned grenades into the crowd . " Eggs ! Eggs ! Footballs ! Footballs ! Sammy Baugh ! Sid Luckman ! Rah rah rah ! Who wants footballs ! Bronco Nagurski ! " His bellow rang magnificently over the entire hilltop . While men everywhere turned and stared as if he were insane , Welsh bellowed on and continued to forward pass grenades to his company , a perfect caricature of the classic football passer 's stance : left arm out , right arm cocked , right leg bent , left leg forward . In the grandly isolated command group one of the seven older men heard him . He turned to look , then slowly grinned his approval . With his elbow he punched a companion to look , too . Soon the entire group were watching Welsh and grinning . This was the type of American soldier these generals liked to see . And across fifteen yards of hilltop crammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his insolent eyes crinkled slyly , and continued to bellow and to throw . Perhaps only one man really understood it , if anyone did , and this was Storm . An ironic grin began to spread across Storm 's cynical , broken-nosed face and drawing his own bayonet he ran over and began hacking open the cases and feeding Welsh the cylinders . " Sammy Baugh ! Sid Luckman ! Jack Manders ! Sammy Baugh ! " they bellowed in unison . " Rah rah rah ! " They went through the entire stack of cases in very little time . By this time E-for-Easy had passed . Taking the last two each for themselves , and laughing idiotically in a moment of rare understanding , they rejoined the Company HQ . With the men stripping off the yellow tapes and opening the cylinders , spreading the cotter pins and buttoning the pull rings down under their pocket flaps as they 'd seen the Marines do , C-for-Charlie moved off down the slope . If Bugger Stein had hoped for an orderly advance by elements ,  |p136he  was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it properly : scouts out , double line of skirmishers . But before they had gone ten yards , all order vanished . It was impossible to keep any sort of formation on this slope which was so crowded with men . Some were simply watchers , standing and looking . Others in straggly lines sweated and panted horribly in the heat , carrying supplies forward . A number of walking wounded were given a wide berth by everyone ; and there were three groups sweating impossibly in the tropic sun to carry back seriously wounded who groaned or whimpered every time their stretchers were jerked or raised or lowered . By the time they reached the 2d Battalion CP on the knoll they had become a resolute gang . What little semblance of order remained was lost passing through the CP personnel . Beyond the command post it was less crowded , but the damage was already done . They were too mixed up to be able to reform into any sort of formation without making a long stop . Stein could only curse with frustration and try to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the brass that was watching him today . His only consolation was that Able and Baker ahead of him and now crossing the brushy bottom , were in no better shape . Around him his own men moved forward steadily with set , curiously covert faces in which the eyes seemed to be trying to betray no expression which might ever be used against them . The men in front , without having to be yelled at by Stein , veered left after Able and Baker according to instructions . Stein was glad of that . One of these men in front was Pfc Doll , who was from the 2d Squad of the 1st Platoon . Doll did n't know how he happened to be in front and it made him feel nervous and peculiarly exposed , but at the same time he was proud of his position and jealous of it . Whenever someone behind seemed to be narrowing the gap , Doll would quicken his pace for a moment so as to stay the same distance in front . It was he who , remembering Stein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker , both of whom had now disappeared in the bottoms . Doll was carrying every bit of armament he had been able to get his hands on . His stolen pistol dangled on his hip fully loaded , cocked and on safety , and on his belt hung two knives now instead of one : his old onep137from home and the new bowie-type knife he had made from the Jap bayonet . Two grenades hung from his pocket flaps and two more reposed in his side pockets . He had not been able to get in on the Thompsonguns , like Charlie Dale , but he still had hopes of being able to get one later on , perhaps from a casualty . He walked steadily ahead with his stomach tingling very unpleasantly , almost sickly , glancing to left and right to make sure no one behind caught up to him . They were receiving very little fire . Now and then a single bullet would strike the ground in amongst them and bury itself or go shrieking off without touching anyone . Nobody could tell whether they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These hurt nobody , but the men blinked and jerked away from them . Every now and then a man would go to ground when one struck near him and commence to crawl until embarrassed by the fact that the others were still up walking . As they advanced down into the dry , treeless ravine they were able to see around the angle of The Elephant 's belly . Here G-forGeorgewas having another go at the right side of Hill 209 . Like Fox on the left they had set up a CP and base of fire on a lower subsidiary ridge and were now plugging away at the main crest with their mortars and machineguns , while receiving heavy mortar fire from the hill in return . Under cover of their fire two platoons of George were creeping close to the crest past the huddled bodies of their former attempts . C-for-Charlie slowed down to watch , then stopped entirely as the two platoons leaped up , their tiny black bayonets visible on their rifles against the dun hillside , and rushed the crest . This time they went almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front , perhaps a half dozen , actually got in among the Japanese who rose to meet them bayonet to bayonet . Here on the right side of the long ridge , where the reverse slope was not jungled and there were no trees along the crest , their struggle was clearly visible . Once again the heavy fire of the powerfully placed Japanese machineguns was too much . The two platoons broke and fled . Left alone , the little group engaged hand to hand attempted to break off their engagement and escape also , leaping and jumping and tumbling head over heels down the slope after their mates . Twop138however did not succeed . They were seen to be dragged alive and still struggling back over the crest by the Japanese . Below in the dry narrow valley C-for-Charlie stood watching this action open-mouthed. 1'fc Doll , for one , felt his heart pounding slowly and thuddingly in his throat . With a raw honesty that was almost insupportable Doll wondered to himself how men could bring themselves to do such things , and what must it feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face with a screaming Jap bent on killing you and engage with him with naked bayonets . That was George Company up there . Doll knew a great many of them . He had a number of good friends in George Company . He had got drunk with them . But to find yourself being dragged back over the crest into the midst of those jabbering , Emperor-worshiping savages . Purtively his right hand sought his pistol . He meant to keep one round in at all times for his own head . But those guys there , they would n't have had time to use a pistol if they had it . If he was using his rifle or bayonet , how could he keep his pistol ready in his hand . He could n't . Doll decided he would have to give this problem more thought , serious thought . Above on the slope the remnants of the two platoons had gone to ground and were hugging the earth under the mortar and MG fire being thrown at them . Behind them C-for-Charlie heard a shout . Turning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battalion knoll waving his arms at them . At first they simply stared . The man continued to shout and wave his arms . Slowly they came out of their trance . Bugger Stein who had been as guilty as the rest suddenly cleared his throat and said , " All right , men , let 's move out . " Glancing stealthily at each other , because no one wanted to betray what he was feeling , they began to move again and Doll , still in the lead , jumped to move out in a sudden fear that somebody might pass him . Sighing loudly , the artillery shells were still arching overhead to crash against the ridge . 155 and 105 shells were bursting on the crest and on both sides of it with an almost continuous roar . Underneaththem C-for-Charlie walked on nervously . There seemed to be so many potentially dangerous objects floating around loose everywheretoday.  |p139One  of the most nervous was young Corporal Fife . Fife had gotten away late because Stein had sent him to Battalion HQ with a message about the spot Bugger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signal Corps men stringing the wire for the company 's sound power phone some distance behind him , Fife was the last man in the crowd . Because he was moving so slowly he remained the last man . Ahead of him he could see Storm marching along with his big jaw set , carrying his Thompsongun in one hand with his rifle slung from his shoulder and surrounded by Dale with his Thompson and the other cooks . Not far from them walked Welsh , Stein and Band and the two clerks Bead and Weld . Fife wanted to catch up to them , but he found it hard to move any faster when he was looking this way and that all the time to see if there was something or someone about to shoot at him . When Fife had come over the lip of the hill down onto the slope , he had experienced a singular feeling of exposure . Only once before in his life had he had a similar sense of such total exposure and that was one time on a patrol on maneuvers when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far he could fall if he should lean over too far . But today the feeling of exposure was accompanied by another of total isolation and helplessness . There were too many things to watch out for . One man simply could not take care of them all to protect himself . It was about as easy to get killed by accident as by enemy deliberation . Trying to look everywhereat once , he stumbled ahead tripping now and then on the tough grass stems or on rocks . When first one bullet and then momentslater a second kicked up puffs of dust in front of him , he went to ground and began to crawl , convinced some Japanese sniper had signaled him out to shoot at . The crawling was hard work . The kneehigh grass made it hard for him to see where he was going . Sweat poured down his forehead and over his glasses . He had to stop repeatedly to wipe them . Finally he tied his grimy handkerchief across his forehead . This helped a little . But there was something else bothering him : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had passed into the crowd and had spread the pins and buttoned them under his pocket flaps . Now as he crawled they bounced and bumped along the ground , catching on grass stems  |p140Terrified  by the aspect of one of them pulling off and igniting its three-second fuse underneath him , ashamed of himself for what he considered his cheap cowardice , but not so ashamed that shame could wash away the imagined picture , Fife unbuttoned his pocket flaps from over them and rolled them away from him , left them and crawled on . But when he raised up his head to look around he could see that the company , all of whom appeared to be standing up walking , was alarmingly far ahead of him , and gaining . It was then that Fife had had to make a heroic decision . Terrified as he was of standing up and being shot at by some invisible party , he was more terrified of being accused for his cowardice . His back muscles crawling , he stood up and took one tentative step , then another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trotting bent over at the waist and carrying his rifle at high port . When another bullet kicked up dirt in front of him and went screaming off , he shut his eyes , then opened them and trotted on . It was just then that the entire company had stopped to witness George Co 's attempt on the crest , and Fife was able to catch up to them . He too saw the attack . He stood with the others , wide-eyed , slack-mouthed , disbelieving , until the arm-waving shouter on the knoll reminded them that they were not here simply as spectators . Then he picked himself a spot in amongst the Company HQ and stayed with them , comforted unreasonably to be in a crowd . The brushy bottom of the ravine was just in front of them . When they emerged from the brush of the bottom and began to climb , they were not far from the protection of the subsidiary ridge which held Fox 's command post . In a very few minutes they would pass into complete cover behind it , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just here that the first man in the company was wounded . Whether deliberately or by accident no one could tell , because no one could tell whether the desultory fire they were getting was aimed or was simply stray bullets from the ridge . The man 's name was Peale and he was an older man , perhaps thirty-five , one of the draftees . He was moving in the middle of the crowd , not far from John Bell and not far from Fife and the CompanyHQ either , when he suddenly clapped his hand to his thighp141and stopped , then sat down holding his leg , his lips trembling , his lace white . Bell ran over to him pulling at his first aid pack . " Are you all right , Peale ? " " I 'm hit , " Peale said thickly . " I 'm wounded . I 'm hit in the leg . " But before Bell could get his first aid packet out one of the company'smedics was there with a gauze compress and looking very serious at this first opportunity of exercising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tore open the pantsleg and inspected the wound which was bleeding only superficially . A little rill of dark blood ran down the white leg . Peale and Bell stared at it . The medic salted the compress with sulfa powder and wrapped it onto the wound with a roll of gauze . The bullet had gone in but had not come out . Peale had begun to grin stiffly . His face still white , his lips still trembling , his mouth was nevertheless stretched into a stiff but happily cynical grin . " Can you walk ? " the medic asked him . " I do nt think so , " Peale said . " I think my leg hurts pretty bad . You better help me . I think it 's goin to be a long time before I can walk good again . " " Well , come on . I 'll take you back , " the medic said and grunting , hoisted him up onto his one good leg . Behind them , coming up with the Company HQ , Bugger Stein was already calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep going , do n't stop . First one then another they began to turn away back to the climb . " So long , Peale . " " Take it easy , Peale . " " Good luck , Peale . " " So long , you guys , " Peale called after them , his voice rising as they moved away . " So long . You guys take it easy . So long . Good luck , you guys . Do nt worry about me . It 'll be a long time before I can walk good . No doctor 's goin to tell me I can walk on this leg . Good luck , you guys ! " All of them had passed him now moving up the slope and he suddenly stopped calling as though he knew it was futile and stood looking after them , his grin fading . Then with his arm around thep142neck of the medic he turned to descend . Fife , who was one of the very last to pass him , heard what he said as he turned away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the medic , " and I been in combat . I never even seen a Jap ; but I do nt care . No doctor 's gon na tell me I can walk on this leg for a long time . Come on , let 's get out of this . Before I get hit again and get killed . That 'd be hell , would n't it ? " Fife , too dumbfounded by the events of the day and still in a state of shock , did not know what to think of this and , in fact , did not think anything . His ear simply recorded it . A little further in front John Bell , as he climbed on , knew only that he had about Peale a curious double feeling of grinding envy and at the same time a great relief that it was not himself who had been injured , hurt , like that . Whether Peale made good his promise about the doctors or not no one ever found out , but C-for-Charlie did not see him again . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief it gave them was enormous , unbelievable . From the look on their faces they might have just been removed clean away , all the way back to the real safety of Australia . In front of them B-forBakerin battalion reserve , and equally relieved , had spread out over the only level space available on the slope and were already digging their slit trenches for the night . C-for-Charlie passed through them with an exchange of greetings that was near-hysterical in its happy relief to be out of the line of fire . Behind them and out of sight now on Hill 209 , though not out of hearing , the fight went on . The spot Bugger had picked for his CP was a tiny spur a hundred yards below the crest . Het e the Company HQ and the mortar squads dropped off , Culp going on up with the rifle platoons to place his two machineguns . While they waited for him to come back and place the mortars , Mazzi and Tills , who were members of the same mortar squad , engaged in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the walk the company had made under their first fire . The overly gay mood of relief and safety still prevailed in everybody . But underneath it lurked the unspoken awareness that today had not been tough at all , that this protection was only temporary ,  |p143that  eventually the good luck would run out and people would die . It was visible in the dark depths of everyone 's eyes . " This Tills , " Mazzi sneered squatting by the Gomm baseplate that he carried . " He spent more time on his belly on the fuckin ground than he did up on his feet . I do nt see how he managed to keep up with the rest of us . " Tills , looking sheepish , did not answer . " Ai nt that right , Tills , " Mazzi said . " Did n't you ? " " I guess you never hit the dirt any , did you ? " Tills said . " Did you see me ? " " No , I never , " Tills admitted lamely . " You fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I say ? Anybodycould tell that fire was n't aimed fire . It was stray stuff from the ridge . So it could hit you just as well layin down as standin up . Maybe better . " " And I guess you was n't never scared even once ? " Tills said angrily . Mazzi merely grinned at him without answering , his face crinkled up around his eyes , his head on one side . " Well , I was , " Fife said clearly . " I was scared shitless . All the time . From the minute I stepped onto the slope till I got here . I was crawlin around on my belly like a snake . I never been so scared in my life . " But it did not help him to tell it . He found that no matter how he overstated it he could not convey the true extent of his fear . It became only funny , when you said it . It was n't the same thing at all . " So was I , " little Bead put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . " Bugger Stein happened to be standing not far away , with Lt Band and one of the platoon lieutenants who had come down from the ridge to ask something , and Fife saw him stop what he was saying and look over straight at him , Fife , with a surprised look of reluctant approval . It was as though Bugger would have liked to have said the same thing himself but could n't , and at the same time had not expected anything so honest to come from Fife . For a momentFife felt a fleeting resentment . Then taking Bugger 's look of approval as his cue , he began to elaborate his adventure of the walk under fire . He had not meant to tell anyone about the grenades , butp144now he did , making himself the buffoon . Before very long he had all of them laughing hard , even the three officers and Mazzi the New York lief ) guy . He was the honest coward . ' If you wanted to make people like you , play the buffoon whom they could laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still did not make him feel any better : did not alleviate his shame , did not cause to cease the misery of fear he felt right now . " As a matter of fact , " he said , utilizing even this point , " I 'm still scared shitless , right now . " As if to prove him right , there was an instant 's fluttering sound in the air , not unlike a man blowing through a keyhole , and three geysers of dirt spouted into the air thirty-five yards away , followed instantly by one loud clap of sound . There was an antlike scramble on the little spur as everyone tried to hit the dirt on the slope away from the surprise . Private Mazzi , if not the foremost , was certainly not the last among them , and Tills had the last word . " Not even once you were n't scared ? " he asked loudly , as they all began to get up with sheepish faces when no more shells arrived . Everyone was glad to laugh at Mazzi and turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not laugh . " And I guess you stood up there like a big fat fucking hero , fuckface , " he said and glowered sullenly at Tills . There was some muttering about short rounds , but it was soon stopped by Stein . Everybody knew that the Japanese had a habit of dropping their heavy mortar shells in , to upset the troops , whenever there was an American artillery barrage . However , the arrival of the mortar shells did put a stop to the discussions . Everyone decided at the same time to unship their entrenching tools and start digging their slit trenches , the heavy work of which they had been putting off . Bead and Weld were designated to dig the holes for Stein and Band , who decided it was time they inspected the ridge . Corporal Fife was put in charge of them . During his little comic routine of the honest coward ' , Fife had noted that Welsh was the only one who had not laughed . Instead the First Sergeant , who was standing with Storm ( who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Now , when Fife had put his assistant clerks to work on the officers ' holes , he wentp145over to Welsh and Storm who , after a prolonged discussion about night infiltrators , were preparing to dig their holes together at a certain spot . " Hey , First , is this where you guys 've decided to dig in ? " he said cheerfully . Welsh , in the act of detaching his shovel from his combat pack , did not look up or answer . " Because I thought I 'd dig in over here with you guys if it was , " Fife said . Welsh ignored him . " I mean , I guess it 's as good a place as any , " Fife said . " This is where you 're gon na dig , ai nt it ? " Welsh continued to ignore him . " Is that okay ? " Fife said . He unslung his pack . Welsh stopped his unbuckling of straps and looked up at Fife with eyes of stone and a face as expressionless as unchiselled granite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get the fuck away from me . And stay away from me , kid . " Storm had stopped his work to watch . Fife was carried back a step by the sheer viciousness of the sergeant'sretort . " Well , tsh000 ! " He attempted a sarcasm which did not come off . " I certainly did n't mean to inflict my presence on any-body . " Welsh stared at him , silent , refusing to be drawn into any carpingdiscussion . " Well , I guess I know when I 'm not wanted , " Fife said with a lame try at airiness . Visibly crestfallen , unable to hide it , he turned and moved off carrying his pack by its straps . " Why do n't you ever treat the kid decent once in a while ? " Storm said . His voice was dispassionate . " Because I do n't mean to wind up playin nursemaid and havin to mother some kid , that 's why . I got enough problems to occupy me . " Welsh straightened from his pack . " Here . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mattock . " Storm did n't answer and exchanged the tools . Behind and above them Lt Culp was coming down the slope in the great leaping strides of a fullback on vacation . Hardly pausing at the CP he col/lected his mortar section and carried them on down to a nearly level spot almost a hundred yards below . From here they could lob shells over the crest onto the precipitous jungled slopes beyond . After setting up their mortars , they would dig in their own perimiter defensefor the night . For quite a long while everyone was occupied with digging . Private Mazzi was still infuriated at Tills for having given him the finger when the mortar shells dropped in . It was an unfair advantage because everybody had ducked for cover . On the other hand during the walk across Mazzi had not hit the dirt one time . While he had seen Tills go down on at least three occasions . So Mazzi had every right to ridicule Tills . While Tills had no right to ridicule Mazzi . Him and Tills was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Mazzi had not picked Tills for a buddy . He did not like to be buddying with a cornball hick from Hicksville who was not hep . But in this mortar squad there had not been no choice . In this mortar squad Tills was only an ammunition carrier . Mazzi was designated as the second gunner and carried the baseplate . But he was really only an ammunition carrier , too , because Sergeant Wick and the first gunner , who carried the tube , did everything together and handled all the firing between them . Mazzi hardly got to touch the sights . And the other ammunition carrier Tind was only a punk kid draftee . So there was n't nothing left but Tills . Mazzi treated him kind and gave him lots of good advice , and was always right , and Tills always ignored it and did something else , and was always wrong . But he would n't never learn , and would n't never admit Mazzi was always right . That was what come of trying to be buddies with a cornball hick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mazzi made up his mind he was n't having no more to do with Tills . Fullback Culp had ordered them to dig two-man holes and double up , one awake and one sleeping , and ordinarily Mazzi would have dug with Tills . This time instead he asked Tind in a loud voice to dig with him , without saying a word to Tills , leaving Tills to dig alone . And after digging in , he got permission from The Fullback to go up to the crest for a while . All his good buddies who were hep , a whole gang of them from Thep147Bronx and Brooklyn , Carni , Suss , Gluk , and Tassi , were all up there in the 1st Platoon . He could feel Tills looking after him , but he ignored him . Let him do his own damn fucking thinking . See how he liked it . The fact that he had been scared on the walk across did n't have nothing to do with it . He had n't hit the ground , had he ? Everybodywas scared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a loud roar of laughter wafted down the steep fall to them from the crest . By standing up and leaning their heads far back the CP men could see the platoons on the ridge , seemingly almost straight above them , small but sharp in the sunlight . " What the hell 's going on ? " somebody yelled up . " Nellie Coombs 's got a hard on , " a voice yelled down . " Is that horny or not ? Waitin here to get his ass shot off . " " It 's a lie , " the man below yelled up . " Like hell it 's a lie ! " the voice above cried . " I just seen it . It 's no lie . " Mazzi , as he climbed on , laughed . Nellie Coombs 's sexual propensitieswere almost legend , as well known as his improper practicesat cards . Everyone knew them . And those were all Mazzi 's bunch of hep pals up there in the 1st Platoon . Mazzi would be interested to see how many of them had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slit trenches curved along the military crest of the ridge in a parallel line a few yards below the true crest . On the other side tall jungle trees strung with lianas towered above it . From up here , above the subsidiary ridge and only a few yards lower than the highest point on Hill 209 , it was possible to view the entire bowl of the battle area . The officers had climbed up to inspect the company'sline before the work on the holes was done , and Captain Bugger Stein had stood for a long time looking down at this panoramaof a military operation . Now , the work of digging done , the platoons could sit on the sides of their holes and have grandstand seats . Not all of them wanted to , however , and soon a blackjack game which included Mazzi and his New York friends as players , was under way on the edge of Nellie Coombs 's hole . Cries of " Hit me ! " and " I 'll stay " competed with the battle noises from 2d Battalion.  |p148And  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of his slit trench and look down into the basin . It was a formidable sight . Except for the slopes of Hill 209 still under Japanese fire , the entire area was aswarm with American troops carrying supplies and wounded . 2d Battalion still battered at the hill , trying to take it . When Bugger Stein had stood for so long looking down at it , the situation was static . But now , as the first afternoon shadows began to creep out from the deepest hollows down there , a new artillery barrage began to crash down onto the right side of the long ridge where George Co had attacked before . Minutes later a roaring came from the west , growing in volume to a piercing shriek until seven P-38s carrying depthcharges appeared in the sky , then flashed by overhead . The planes made two preliminarypasses for looking , then on the third pass dropped the big black drums which threw up oily gouts of flame as they burst along the ridge . Not one landed on the Japanese forward slope toward the Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The infantrywatched them wistfully . The artillery continued to gnaw at the ridge . The Japanese , without either planes or artillery to support them , were fighting back toughly . Bell , knocking the flat of his mattock against the edge of his dangling foot with rhythmic thoughtfulness as he sat and watched , could not help feeling , along with his fear of them , a little sorry for them . On the other hand it was a purely intellectual sorrow . They would not feel sorry for him , so to hell with them . Still , he was glad he was on his side instead of theirs . He was also glad he was here and not there , with the 2d Battalion . Intellectually , he felt sorry for almost everyone . His wife Marty , for instance . In a way this war was tougher on her than it was on him . Bell knew how much a need she had of physical affection , its reassurance , its re-establishment of  --  of existence , of personality . In a way it was much harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nightclubs , booze , people than it was for him to be here where there was nothing to be tempted by . Much harder . But all of this was intellectual . Emotionally , Bell felt sorry most of all for himself . Something had happened to him today with the wounding ofp149Peale . Perhaps it was the sheer accident of it . There was no earthly reason why that bullet should have struck Peale and not someone else . But whatever it was , when he saw that little hole in Peale 's leg with its trickle of blood running down the white thigh , the actualityof his own death , perhaps sometime soon , perhaps not , had become a reality to Bell . It terrified him . Bell understood the superstitioustalisman he had made of never having anything to do with any other women after being called up ; he would not even have conversations with them for fear of feeling some desire . Now he added to that first superstition a second which was that if he and Marty both remained true to each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continuing to tap his pick-mattock against his shoe , he continued to watch the basin , wondering if that first light shot of malaria he 'd had this morning would come back on him tonight . Everybody who had it said evening seemed to be the worst time for attacks . The planes had claimed everyone 's attention , even that of the blackjack players , and when the barrage lifted everybody who was up high enough was watching . From up here the distance to the right end of Hill 209 was greater and the tiny greenclad figures harder to see . They seemed to pass in and out of visibility as they moved up the slope . Much closer , though still far , the small figures of Fox Company 's mortar section could be seen on the reverse slope of the subsidiary ridge , working their mortars like fury . And indeed , all across the basin , as the shadows in the hollows continued to creep outward , wherever there were weapons men served them furiously , putting down fire on the ridge . This time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny Japanese chest to chest on the crest , pushed them back and disappeared over the top . Others followed them . After a moment , when they did not reappear running backward , feeble cheers broke out faintly all across the basin on the rearward slopes , soundingmore stimulated by a sense of duty than by any real happiness . Undoubtedly the others , like C-for-Charlie whose cheering was quite light , were thinking more about what might be in store for themselvestomorrow , than about what 2d Battalion had accomplished today.  |p150But  the morrow was not to be so bad . 2d Battalion had been ordered to renew the assault at dawn , this time against Hill 210 , The Elephant 's Head and the regiment 's main objective . This good news reached them by evening together with the details of today 's fight . The regimental commander had dictated a bulletin which was copied down in longhand on the spot by clerks and sent forward to all companies . It said that American arms had triumphed . All of Hill 209 was now in American hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodenly and uncommunicatively ) had made a march of eleven hundred yards along the edge of the jungle while receiving fire from two directions , and with twenty-five casualties and the aid of G-for-George had completedthe envelopment of the Japanese position . They had killed fifty Japanese , captured seventeen machineguns , eight heavy mortars , and a host of smaller arms . They took no prisoners ; the Japanese who had not escaped back to Hill 210 preferred to die . 2d Battalion 's losses had been 27 killed and 8o wounded , many of whom were picked up on the slopes after the battle . The majority of the Japanesedead were not in good physical condition and many appeared to have suffered from malnutrition . This was the official news , would be written into the Regimental Papers . C-for-Charlie could n't have cared less . They were glad 2d Battalion had won the hill , of course . But they were more glad to learn that 2d Battalion was continuing the attack . That the Japanese were hard up for food did not interest them at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that after what they 'd witnessed the numbers were astonishingly light . There seemed some hope in that . If , of course , they were being told the truth . But the news that interested them most was unofficial . It was not contained in the regimental commander 's bulletin , but it was in the mouth of every messenger who carried the bulletin forward . This was the story of what happened to the two men from George Co whom they had watched the Japanese drag back over the crest in the earlier assault . Their bodies had been found on the reverse slope after the Japanese retreat . Both bodies had sustained numerous bayonet wounds , and one of them had been beheaded alive with a sword . He was found by the advancing E-for-Easy with his handsp151tied behind his back and his head sitting on his chest . And as a gesture of defiance , or hatred , or something , the Japanese after beheadinghim had severed his genitals and stuffed them into the mouth of the severed head . That this occurred after death was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mutilated crotch . That he had been beheaded alive was equally clear from the amount of blood which had soaked into the earth near the severed neck . The sheer barbarity of the thing swept through C-for-Charlie like a cold water shock . A cold knifing terror in the belly was followed immediately by a rage of anger . These men they were fighting were veterans of Burma and China and Sumatra . That they professed to hate all white men was well known . That they had perpetrated this sort of outrage in China and the Philippines on their own darkskinnedraces was known too . But that they would dare to do the same sort of thing to civilized white American infantry , and specificallythe  --  Regiment of the  --  Division , was almost too much to believe and certainly too much to be borne . There was a storm of promises never to take a by God prisoner . Many swore they would henceforth coolly and in cold blood shoot down every Japanese who came their way , and preferably in the guts . The official sources were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt it might overly frighten the troops . More likely they felt that to let it out would be to allow the entrance of basic human problems into what official sources hoped to keep an essentiallysimple , uncomplicated military situation . That was what Bugger Stein felt , and he disagreed . Official sources always wanted a clean , clearcut , easily understood military campaign , easily explainableafterwards in terms of strategy and tactics which the generalsof the world could write about cleanly , and this sort of thing was embarrassing to that concept . But in spite of official sources the story had swept around the front like wildfire , and Stein did not intend to be a party to the suppression of it . The troops should know what they were in for . Perhaps those two poor bastards had n't felt much . After all , with the adrenalin and rage and shock of fighting hand to hand , they were probably half crazed . That was all that Stein could see to hope for.  |p152When  the messenger who brought the bulletin delivered his other , unofficial news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a riot of murderousreaction . Storm , Bead , Culp , Doll who had come down from 1st Platoon with a message , and Lt Band all made sanguinary promises . Storm looked particularly killerish . Only Welsh with his sly eyes said , and showed , nothing . Little Dale the second cook with his stooped shoulders and intense , tough , flat-eyed face was almost beside himself and swore to gutshoot every Jap who tried to come to him to surrender , after toying with him five minutes first . Young Corporal Fife 's reaction on the other hand ( though he said not a single word ) was one of fear , disbelief and finally a massive horror ( as he enviously watched these others ) that any creatures who spoke a language , walked upright on two legs , dressed in clothes , built cities , and claimed to be human beings could actually treat each other with such fiendish animal cruelty . Obviously the only way really to survive in this world of humansocalledculture we had made and were so proud of , was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met . And Fife , for the very first time in his life , was beginning to believe he did not have the toughness of characterwhich this demanded . It was Pfc Doll who carried the news up the slope to the platoons on the line . John Bell , when Doll on his way back to the 1st Platoon stopped off to tell the 2d , was standing with his squad leader Mother McCron and Big Queen and another man named Cash . Queen , made sergeant after the defection of Stack , and Cash were both 1st Platoon . Queen 's and McCron 's squads linked the two platoons , and Bell 's and Cash 's holes were the actual joining point . The two sergeantswere just in the act of telling the two men to buddy up for the night , one sleeping and one awake , to facilitate liaison between the platoons , when Doll reached the crest , breathing heavily , with his news . Bell had never seen such reactions on men 's faces . Big Queen turned red as a beet with rage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . McCron 's eyes got vague and faraway and his face took on an unwilling , shamed look as if he did not want to hear as he muttered , " Oh , the dirty fuckers , " sadly . Cash , a tall powerfully built Ohio draftee who had been a cab driver in Toledop153and was known in the company simply as " Big Un , " on the other hand grinned . He had a cold , gleefully tough face anyway , as hard and of the same texture as an untracked walnut , and when he grinned and licked his lips like that , his blue eyes squinted , he looked positively and spinechillingly murderous . All he said was " Okay " in a very soft , breathed voice . He said it several times . Bell 's own reactionwas one of sickness . He felt sick all over , physically sick . He said nothing . But he thought . He thought about the new talisman he had made just today , and he thought about his wife Marty . Ah , Marty . He hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody would ever write or tell her how this cock and these balls of his which she had loved so had finally wound up . The evening itself that night , in cynical contrast to the news , was very lovely . Up here in the hills night did not fall so swiftly as it did down below in the groves . The twilight lingered on turning everything including the air itself to rose , seeming as though it were reluctant to leave and plunge them into the blackness of their first night in combat . It did not depart until , apparently diabolically , it had given them a lovely striated tropic sunset to look at in the westernsky . It was a time to think of peacefulness and women . Shortly before dark , when it came time to eat , it was found that there was no water . There was plenty of C ration around . But ration details coming down from the platoons on the crest wanted water much worse than food . The sun , the heat , the sweltering , and the sweating had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them had seen jeeploads of watercans on the way up from the river . But wherever these were , diverted into the back areas , or poured out on the ground , they were not at the front . Finally , after much haggling and arguing on the sound power phone and much sending back and forth of messengers , Stein was able to obtain enough water to allow each man half a canteen , which was to last him all through tomorrow . Supper was eaten dry and cold , choked down without any liquid to wash it down . In the night it rained twice . No one slept much . Many useless grenades were thrown . And every now and then flaming bursts of riflefire lit the night , betraying positions , hitting nothing . And at dawn , bearded , mudstained , grimy and greasy , rising inp154their blue holes to watch 2d Battalion take off over the top of Hill 209 , the whole of C-for-Charlie looked as though they had been living here for months . In the chill mists of first light , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one by one , crouching and carrying their rifles in both hands or one , they hopped over the last foot of ridge and disappeared . A sort of ragged cheer rose briefly and fell away . After that those who remained watched in silence . With The Elephant 's Shoulder and Hill 209 now secured , the line snaked along for a thousand yards and more , following the contours of the several ridges which formed the Dancing Elephant 's spine . As the attacking companies of 2d Battalion were pulled out and sent forward a gap was opened up between the two battalions , and twice during the morning C-for-Charlie was forced to move . Breakfast had been choked down dry , also . After that there was nothing to do but sit and wait . The moves , when the orders for them came , were not difficult to make . The left platoon simply pulled out , passing to the rear of the right one , and took up positions at the appointed spot . Then the former right platoon , now the left , joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same maneuver and to the left of Able a battalion of the division 's reserveregiment was moving in . Even with the two moves , they had not moved far enough right to see into the battle area proper . They were now almost to the actual Elephant 's Shoulder , and they could now hear the mortar and machinegun fire . But just here , as though The Dancing Elephant to keep its balance had hunched its massive shoulders , the ridge curved inward forming an angle of jungle which cut off the view . They were now on the same slope where yesterday , while they watched , F-for-Fox had made its try for the crest and been repulsed ; and recognizing it with a sense of squeamishness , they settled down again to wait . They were not unaware that each time they were moved , it was closer to the fight , never farther away from it . During one of the moves Fullback Culp had seen something move in the brush below , or thought he had . At that moment they had been above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F-for-Fox CP had occupied yesterday , and at the foot of its forward slope ap155small brushgrown draw fell steeply to the main ravine . Culp stopped and whistled softly and pointed . Far down below them in the basin , so recently secured from the enemy , lines and groups of men were moving everywhere with supplies , but up here on the forward slope of the subsidiary ridge there was no one . Nobody else could see anythingmoving in the brush , but a sort of gleeful manhunt was organized anyway . Increasingly since yesterday and irrespective of rank the seven men who carried the new Thompsonguns had begun to see themselves more and more as a sort of private club . Welsh , Storm , Dale , MacTae , the officers Stein and Band , all of them except Culp were part of the Company HQ anyway , and Culp as commanderof the weapons platoon was almost always with the HQ . And it was now the club which took over the manhunt . Spacing themselves so nothing in the little draw could get past their combinedfire , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch , they waited while two of them , Culp and MacTae , came down the draw like beaters . When they had come halfway and with everyone watching intently , still nothing had moved . " Watch out , " Culp called from above , grinning with all his teeth . " I 'm gon na give ' em a burst or two , if they 're in there . Hold on . " Turning the gun in its side in the approved manner , he sprayed the brush with two short bursts . When he released the trigger he looked surprised . " Damn things really do kick . More'n I thought . " Still nothing moved in the brush . " Come on , let 's look , " MacTae said . The two of them disappeared into the brush , which swayed above their heads as they moved . They came out looking sheepish . " Nothin , " Culp said . " But you never can tell . Might of been . You know , infiltrators . " He was quite right . There had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there was a good deal of nervous laughter at his expense , anyway , as they all climbed back up to the platoons on the line . There had been some rather extreme nervous tension there for a moment , and now it relieved itself in laughter at Culp . None of them , they found to their surprise , were at ease in the use of their weapons . They had been trained too well and too long in the restrictivesafety precautions of the rifle range to feel relaxed shooting over the heads of friends.  |p156Shortly  after noon they sustained a counterattack . After the firing all stopped , and they began to compare notes , it was discovered that not one of them could honestly say he had seen a Japanese during the firing . Later it was found that D Company on their right actually had repelled what was probably a patrol in force and had killed several . But when D had begun firing , the firing had spread all along the line until everybody , including the battalion from the reserve regiment on the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the jungle whether they saw any Japanese or not . And even afterward when it was over , at least half of the firers still believedthey had repelled a major Japanese attack . The others , who knew better , momentarily looked sheepish in the midst of their excitement , but were unable to refrain from rejoining the wild celebration . A few perhaps wondered what the Japanese patrol must have thought , to see a line a thousand yards long suddenly blaze up firing at nothing ; they must have laughed heartily . Corporal Fife , curiously enough , was one of these cynics . With the rest of the Company HQ he had rushed to the line when the firing started . He had fired a whole clip of eight and reloaded , intending to fire more , before common sense attacked him in the form of a deep depression at the uselessness of it all . All around him men were hollering happily and throwing their grenades and firing . A few feet to his left Welsh , cursing joyously and grinning ecstatically , was spraying everything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty jungle underbrush swayed and rustled as though in a rainstorm and chunks of bark and wood popped from the trees . Nursing his depression and setting his safety , he crept back away from the line a few feet and sat down by himself , cradling his rifle between his knees and leaning on it . What the hell was the matter with him ? Even in a happy blowoff of useless firing he could not take part . But what depressed him most of all was the awareness of all these new situations he was being thrown into , which he could neither evaluate nor understand . It was like being blind . It was during this ' counterattack ' that Pfc Doll threw his first live grenade , and it was a traumatic experience . Doll lost his nerve . At the point where Doll stood the ridge made a slight dip and there was a chest high clay bank ( whether manmade or not it was impossiblep157to tell ) behind which one could stand as though in a trench , though the back of it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started was feeble and sporadic and spread slowly , but when it thickened and the dull booming of grenades began to be heard among the chattering of riflefire Doll who had already fired a clip pulled one of his four grenades from a side pocket and pulled its pin . He had spread the cotter pins so widely for reasons of safety that he had to bite its ends together before it would pull out , sending a sharp drill of pain through an old bad tooth . Perhaps that was what undid him . He remembered movies where men pulled the pins of grenades with their teeth , and realized with a shock of inadequacy that his teeth would never be able to stand it . In any case , he had waited too long . He now had the pin out and was standing looking at this heavy orange corregated castiron object in his hand . As long as he clenched it and kept the tin lever down it was not dangerous , but already his hand felt slippery . Even if he had not already dropped the pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reinsert it , dangerous to attempt . He had activated it , and now here he was with it , and if he did not want to go on carrying it forever while his hand slowly weakened or cramped itself and relaxed , he was going to have to throw it ; but what he really wanted to do was simply drop it on the ground and turn and flee . That of course was crazy , insane . If it did not kill him , it would certainly kill the men around him . Why oh why had he ever pulled the pin out ? Clenching his teeth until his jaws ached , spacing his feet with great care , oblivious to the noise and firing around him and staring with bulging eyes at the object in his hand as though it were a lighted bomb he was holding , which in fact it was , he threw it with all his strength into the jungle and ducked shaking behind the bank , the splatt ! ' of the igniting fuse as loud in his ears as an explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket , he had meant to watch it light and explode . There was no thought of that now . He could no more have stayed up and watched it than he could have flown after it . He heard a low boom from across the bank , then immediately after it two others . He would never know which was his , and he did n't care . Shattered , he crouched quaking against the bank for several momentsmore , then blushing furiously , rose and commenced firingp158his rifle angrily into the empty jungle , hoping nobody had seen him . He fired three clips one after the other , but he did not try to throw any more grenades . When the whole thing was over , he simply turned in his tracks and sat down with his knees drawn up and his back against the bank , breathing in a kind of convulsive groan and staring furiously at nothing . Somehow during the firing session a dead man had appeared behindC-for-Charlie . In the excitement he went unnoticed at first . Then everyone seemed to discover him all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled faces . Nobody knew how he had got there or where he came from or who he was . He could not be from C-for-Charlie because nobody in Charlie had been hurt . He could not have been killed just now in the counterattack ' because he was obviously already stiff . He had just sort of appeared . Ten yards back from the crest down the slope which was not as steep here as at other places , on a little clay ledge about two yards wide , he lay on his side in an almost foetal position , his knees drawn up against his chest , his half clenched hands up on either side of his face but not touching it . His helmet still on his head , his rifle belt still fastened around his green fatigue blouse , he appeared to be trying to hide from what had already overtaken him . Just below his little clay ledge the slope steepened sharply , and if he could only have rolled over once he could have slid all the way to the bottom of the basin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established later that he was a 2d Battalion man who had been killed yesterday but who had not been found until just now because he had fallen a few feet over the crest . D Company had found him while pursuing the Japanese patrol and had placed him on the ledge behind C-for-Charlie for safekeeping at a time when C-for-Charlie was too engrossed in its firing to notice . In the meantime , here he was . The flush of excited talking and laughter had all died quietly away . Angry frowns began to appear . There was muttering . C-for-Charlie did not feel they had done anything to deserve him , and they resented his being palmed off on them . Several men who cautiously approached to within six or seven yards of him returned to say that he smelled . Not strongly yet perhaps , but enough to be upsetting . Soon cries were heard : " Medic ! Medic ! " " Wherep159the hell 's the goddam medics ! " " Tell the medics to get that stiff out of here ! " Everyone was indignant . They came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause , they came for him . Two harrassed-Iooking men climbed up from below carrying a folded stretcher . They were obviously tired and looked very short-tempered . Seizing him by a stiffened arm and leg as if they were handles , they deposited him on their stretcher on his back ; but when they tried to lift it , he threatened to roll off . They put it down and turned him on his side . This time when they lifted he did roll off . The men dropped the stretcher and putting their hands on their hips , stared at each other with the air of men who have had about all they can support . Then , bending and seizing him by the handles of his arms and legs , they moved off with him that way , angling down the steep slope , one of them dragging the stretcher by a strap . They had said not one word to anyone . C-for-Charlie had watched all this action wide-eyed and with sheepish faces . They could not help feeling the two men were a little irreverent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , they were aware that their own reaction smacked of irreverence too . Nobody wanted the poor bastard , now . Well , whatever he had accomplished for 2d Battalion in the last moments of his life , which apparently was not much , he had certainly accomplished something after his death . He had solidly and effectively put the quietus to C-for-Charlie 's short-lived mood of high , laughing confidence . It was now after two-thirty . While these experiences were occupyingC-for-Charlie 's attention , the battle round the bend which they could hear but not see had continued unabated . Now for the first time whole groups began to return from it . The attack had failed . Running , they would drop gasping over the crest and lie breathing in hysterical sobs with eyes like drilled holes dark in their outraged , furious , unbelieving faces . More and more groups kept coming in , haphazard , piecemeal , rarely even with their own squads . Everythingwas going to hell , they gasped . C-for-Charlie was close enough now to The Elephant 's Shoulder , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and barrel , that as more and more men returned and spilled out along the interior slope , some of themp160spread over into C-for-Charlie 's area . A few even came dashing in through the extreme right of their line , hollering to them not to shoot , for God 's sake do n't shoot . Once inside they simply collapsed . One boy , sitting in a row of five or six , wept openly like a child , his forehead and hand resting on the shoulder of the man next to him , who patted him absently while staring straight ahead at nothing with smoldering eyes . None of them knew what the overall situation was , or had any idea of what was taking place anywhere except where they themselves had been . C-for-Charlie , feeling shamefaced , watched them quietly with a wide-eyed , awed hero worship , which no one could honestly say he wanted to lose , if it entailed  --  as it would  --  sharing their experiences . What they themselves felt was illustrated by an incident most of C-for-Charlie witnessed . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reaction of a student of war . The division commander had been observing the day 's fighting from the crest of Hill 209 . Of course his career was involved in this offensive . When the groups began returning pellmell and shaken , he strode among them smiling and talking , trying to bolster them . " We 're not gon na let these Japs whip us , are we , boys ? Hunh ? They 're tough , but they 're not as tough as we are , are they ? " One boy , young enough to be the general 's son , if not his grandson , looked up at him from where he sat with distended eyes . " General , you go out there ! You go out there , general , you go out there ! " The general smiled at him , pityingly , and walked on . The boy did not even look after him . I-Iall way down the main ridge the battalion aid station was filled to overflowing with more wounded than the three doctors could take care of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes of the basin leading to Hill 2o6 , where just since yesterday the jeep road had been extended forward , jeeps were coming as far out onto the steep slope as they dared to pick up the hand-carried litter cases , and red-and-white-splashed walking wounded tottered rearward in groups , trying to help each other . Finally the correlated news reached C-for-Charlie , as well as the other companies . The plan had called for two companies to attack abreast after artillery preparation . Fox and George , the workhorsesp161of yesterday , were given the dirtiest work . They were to assault Hill 210 , on the left . E-for-Easy was to attack right , into the area of the Elephant 's Forelegs labeled Hill 214 . Beyond Hill 209 on the left the short , fat Elephant 's Neck rose slowly to the eminence of Hill 21o , a U shaped ridge with its open end toward the attackers  --  to go up there was like walking down a bowling alley toward the bowlers , and before the battle was over that was what it came to be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the couple of hundred yards of open ground immediately in front , was cut by numerous low ridges and hills which might afford protection to attacking troops . On the right , divided from The Elephant 's Head by a lowlyingsalient of jungle , the broader , lower , more level area of The Elephant 's Forelegs spread itself . This was the terrain , still as yet never seen by C-for-Charlie , which 2d Battalion had had to attack . Everything had begun to go wrong almost immediately . First of all there was very little water , hardly half a canteen per man . Fox had led off , followed by George , who were to come abreast of them later for the assault up both sides of The Bowling Alley . But almost at once Fox was caught in a narrow impasse between two of the preliminaryridges . Heavy fire from in front stopped them . Jammed in the narrow space they were hit repeatedly by mortars which apparentlyhad the ranges all taped out . When they tried to maneuver and work out of it , heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , immediately behind them , could do nothing either and suffered their own mortar casualties . The two companies had remained there through most of the morning and through the early afternoon . Fox Co 's commander was hit by mortar fire around twelve-thirty and was evacuated , but died on the way back to Regiment 's aid station . Squeezed in together under the hot tropic sun and the heavy fire many men , still exhausted from yesterday and waterless today , passed out . When the battalion commandergave the order to retreat , the two companies had broken in out and returned in bunches . E-for-Easy 's attack was likewise a failure . The lead platoon , movingout onto the broader , but flatter area of The Elephant 's Forelegs , had been caught in a withering crossfire from the jungle on its right and left . Easy 's commander , trying to send up an attachedp162machinegun platoon from H , had them almost annihilated . And after that the rest of the company did not try to move and remained just a few yards in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By three-thirty all those who were able had returned . Medical parties , at considerable risk , were searching out the others . There was no dictated bulletin that night by the regimentalcommander . Casualties for the day were 34 killed and 102 wounded . Speculations as to why , with this holocaust , today 's casualtieswere only slightly higher than yesterday 's , were left without any answer . The only reasonable thing to say was that yesterday there had been more hours of actual fighting . But more important than all of this news was the news that the regimental commander had ordered the exhausted 2d Battalion back to Hills 207 and 208 into regimental reserve . This meant that tomorrow 1st Battalion would take over the attack . The battalion from the division 's reserveregiment on their left would then , undoubtedly , take over their lines on Hill 209 . This was exactly what happened , and their orders reached them soon enough . There had existed a remote possibility that the regimentalcommander might order the battalion of the division reserve to make the attack , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Their orders , which reached them around six o'clock , confirmed their wisdom . Colonel Tall 's plan was not radically different from the 2d Battalion'scolonel . Two companies would attack abreast ; C-for-Charlie would be on the left and would capture The Elephant 's Head , Hill 210 , and A-for-Able on the right would move into The Elephant 's Forelegs , Hill 214 , and hook up there with the 3d Battalion who were encountering less resistance . Baker would be in reserve behind Charlie . The plan was really no different from today 's . The only difference was that tomorrow there would be water and whatever casualties 2d Battalion may have inflicted today , if any . C-for-Charlie had drawn the worst assignment : the Bowling Alley . They believed the drawing of the worst assignment to be their perpetualdestiny . And that evening when a company of the divisional reserve battalion moved in to take over their slit trenches so that they might rest up for tomorrow , C-for-Charlie received them with/out friendship . They came smiling and talking , filled with flattering hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be veterans and themselves green ; and C-for-Charlie , treated them to the same morose silences which yesterday morning they themselves had received from E-for-Easy going up to attack . But some time before any of this had happened , young Pfc Bead had killed his first Japanese , the first Japanese to be killed by his company , or for that matter by his battalion . It was , Bead reflected about it later , when indeed he was able to think about it at all , which was not for some time , typical of his entire life ; of his stupid incompetence , his foolish idiocy , his gross mismanagement of everything he put his hands on ; so that whatever he did , done so badly and in such ugly style , gave no satisfaction : action without honor , travail without grace . A man of a different temperament might have found it funny ; Bead could not laugh . At just about five o'clock he had had to take a crap . And he had not had a crap for two days . Everything had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid station below them the last of the wounded were being cared for and sent back . Bead had seen other men taking craps along the slope , and he knew the procedure . After two days on these slopes the procedure was practically standardized . Because every available bit of level space was occupied , jammed with men and equipment , crapping was relegated to the steeper slopes . Here the process was to take along an entrenching shovel and dig a little hole , then turn your backside to the winds of the open air and squat , balancing yourself precariously on your toes , supporting yourself on the dirt or rocks in front of you with your hands . The effect , because of the men below in the basin , was rather like hangingyour ass out of a tenth floor window above a crowded street . It was an embarrassing position to say the least , and the men below were not above taking advantage of it with catcalls , whistles or loud soulful sighs . Bead was shy . He could have done it that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy , and because now everything had quieted down to an unbelievable evening peace after the terror , noise and danger of the afternoon , he decided to have himself a pleasant , quiet , private crap in keeping with the peacefulness . Without saying any/thing to anyone he dropped all of his equipment by his hole and taking only his GI roll of toilet paper , he started to climb the twenty yards to the crest . He did not even take an entrenching tool because on the other side there was no need to bury his stool . Beyond the crest he knew that the slope did not drop precipitously as it did further to the left , but fell slowly for perhaps fifty yards through the trees before it plunged in a bluff straight down to the river . This was where D Company had caught the Japanese patrol earlier in the day . " Hey , bud , where you going ? " somebody from the 2d Platoon called to him as he passed through . " To take a shit , " Bead called back without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began three yards below the actual crest . Because the jungle was thinner with less undergrowth here at its outer edge , it looked more like the columnar , smooth-floored woods of home and made Bead think of when he was a boy . Reminded of times when as a Boy Scout he had camped out and crapped with peaceful pleasure in the summer woods of Iowa , he placed the roll of paper comfortablynear , dropped his pants and squatted . Half way through with relieving himself , he looked up and saw a Japanese man with a bayoneted rifle moving stealthily through the trees ten yards away . As if feeling his gaze , the Japanese man turned his head and saw him in almost the same instant but not before , through the electrifying , heart stabbing thrill of apprehension , danger , disbelief , denial , Bead got a clear , burned in the brain impression of him . He was a small man , and thin ; very thin . His mud-slicked , mustard-khaki uniform with its ridiculous wrap leggins hung from him in jungledamp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elaborate camouflage Bead had been taught by movies to expect , he did not even wear a helmet . He wore a greasy , wrinkled , bent up forage cap . Beneath it his yellowbrown face was so thin the high cheekbones seemed about to come out through his skin . He was badly unshaven , perhaps two weeks , but his greasy looking beard was as straggly as Bead 's nineteen-year-old one . As to age , Bead could not form any clear impression ; he might have been twenty , or forty.  |p165All  of this visual perception occurred in an eyewink of time , an eyewink which seemed to coast on and on and on , then the Japanese man saw him too and turning , all in one movement , began to run at him , but moving cautiously , the bayonet on the end of his rifle extended . Bead , still squatting with his pants down , his behind still dirty , gathered his weight under him . He was going to have to try to jump one way or another , but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die ? Am I really going to die now ? He did not even have his knife with him . Terror and disbelief , denial , fought each other in him . Why the Japanese did not simply fire the rifle he did not know . Perhaps he was afraid of being heard in the American lines . Instead he came on , obviously meaning to bayonet Bead where he sat . His eyes were intent with purpose . His lips were drawn back from his teeth , which were large , but were well formed and not at all protrudingas in the posters . Was it really true ? In desperation , still not knowing which way to try to jump , all in one movement Bead pulled up his pants over his dirty behind to free his legs and dove forward in a low , shoestring football tackle when the Japanese man was almost to him , taking him around the ankles , his feet driving hard in the soft ground . Surprised , the Japaneseman brought the rifle down sharply , but Bead was already in under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collarbone . By clasping the mudcaked shins against his chest and using his head for a fulcrum , still driving hard with his feet , the Japanese man had no way to fall except backward , and Bead was already clawing up his length before he hit the ground . In the fall he dropped the rifle and had the wind knocked out of him . This gave Bead time to hitch up his pants again and spring upward once more until , kneeling on his upper arms and sitting back on his chest , he began to punch and claw him in the face and neck . The Japanese man could only pluck feebly at his legs and forearms . Bead heard a high , keening scream and thought it was the Japanesebegging for mercy until finally he slowly became aware that the Japanese man was now unconscious . Then he realized it was himself making that animal scream . He could not , however , stop it.  |p166The  Japanese man 's face was now running blood from the clawing , and several of his teeth had been broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not stop . Sobbing and wailing , he continued to belabor the unconscious Japanese with fingernail and fist . He wanted to tear his face off with his bare hands , but found this difficult . Then he seized his throat and tried to break his head by beating it on the soft ground but only succeeded in digging a small hole with it . Exhausted finally , he collapsed forward on hands and knees above the bleeding , unconscious man , only to feel the Japanese immediately twitch with life beneath him . Outraged at such a display of vitality , alternately sobbing and wailing , Bead rolled aside , seized the enemy rifle and on his knees raised it above his head and drove the long bayonet almost full length into the Japanese chest . The Japanese man 's body convulsed in a single spasm . His eyes opened , staring horribly at nothing , and his hands flipped up from the elbows and seized the blade through his chest . Staring with horror at the fingers which were cutting themselves on the blade trying to draw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell down . Hiking his pants up and standing spraddlelegged to keep them from falling , he seized the rifle and tried to pull it out in order to plunge it in again . But the bayonet would not come loose . Remembering dimly something he had been taught in bayonet practice , he grabbed the small of the stock and pulled the trigger . Nothing happened . The gun was on safety . Fumbling with the unfamiliar , foreign safety , he released it and pulled again . There was a flesh-muffled explosion and the bayonet came free . But the fool of a Japanese with his open eyes went on grasping at his chest with his bleeding fingers as if he could not get it through his thick head that the bayonet was out . My god , how much killing did the damned fool require ? Bead had beaten him , kicked him , choked him , clawed him , bayoneted him , shot hint . He had a sudden frantic vision of himself , by rights the victor , doomed forever to kill perpetually the same single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same trap twice , instead of sticking him he reversed the rifle in his hands and drove the butt down full force into his face , smashing it . Standing above him spraddlelegged to keep his pants up , he drove the rifle buttp167again and again into the Japanese man 's face , until all of the face and most of the head were mingled with the muddy ground . Then he threw the rifle from him and fell down on his hands and knees and began to vomit . Bead did not lose consciousness , but he completely lost his sense of time . When he came to himself , still on hands and knees , gasping , he shook his hanging head and opened his eyes and discovered his left hand was resting in a friendly way on the Japanese man 's still , mustard-khaki knee . Bead snatched it away as though he had discoveredit lying across a burning stove . He had an obscure feeling that if he did not look at the corpse of the man he had killed or touch it , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawled feebly away through the trees , breathing in long painful groans . The woods were very quiet . Bead could not remember ever having heard such quiet . Then faintly , penetrating the immensity of this quiet , he heard voices , American voices , and the casual sound of a shovel scraped against a rock . It seemed impossible that they could be that close . He got shakily to his feet holding up his pants . It also seemed impossible that anything could ever again sound as casual as that shovel had . He knew he had to get back inside the lines . But first he would have to try to clean himself up . He was a mess . He had no desire to finish his crap . First of all , he had to go back to the vicinity of the dead man to get his roll of toilet paper . He hated that but there was n't any choice . His pants and his dirty behind were what bothered him most . Horror of that was inbred in him ; but also he was terrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He used most of his roll of toilet paper on that , and in the end even sacrificed one of his three clean handkerchiefs which he was saving back for his glasses , moistening it with spittle . In addition he was spattered with blood and vomit . He could not remove every stain , but he tried to get enough so that nobody would notice . Because he had already decided he was not going to mention this to anybody . Also , he had lost his glasses . He found them , miraculously unbroken , beside the dead man . Searching for his glasses , he had to go right up to the body , and to look at it closely . The faceless  --  almost headless  --  corpse with its bloody , cut fingers and the mangledp168hole in its chest , so short a time ago a living , breathing man , made him so dizzy in the stomach that he thought he might faint . On the other hand , he could not forget the intent look of deliberate purpose on the man 's face as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be any reasonable answer . The feet were the saddest thing . In their hobnailed infantry boots they splayed outward , relaxed , like the feet of a man asleep . With a kind of perverse fascination Bead could not resist giving one of them a little kick . It lolloped up , then flopped back . Bead wanted to turn and run . He could not escape a feeling that , especiallynow , after he 'd both looked and touched , some agent of retribution would try to hold him responsible . He wanted to beg the man 's forgiveness in the hope of forestalling responsibility . He had not felt such oppressive guilt over anything since the last time his mother had caught and whipped him for masturbating . If he 'd had to kill him , and apparently he had , at least he could have done it more efficiently and gracefully , and with less pain and anguish for the poor man . If he had not lost his head , had not gone crazy with fear , perhaps he might even have taken him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been frantic to get the killing over with , as if afraid that as long as the man could breathe he might suddenly stand up and accuse him . Suddenly Bead had a mental picture of them both with positions reversed : of himself lying there and feeling that blade plunge through his chest ; of himself watching that riflebutt descend upon his face , with the final fire-exploding end . It made him so weak that he had to sit down . What if the other man had got the bayonet down quicker ? What if he himself had tackled a little higher ? Insteadof merely a bruise on his collarbone , Bead saw himself spitted through the soft of the shoulder , head on , that crude blade descendinginto the soft dark of his chest cavity . He could not believe it . Settling his glasses on his face , taking a couple of deep breaths and a last look at his ruined enemy , he got up and started clumpingup out of the trees toward the crest . Bead was ashamed and embarrassed by the whole thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't want to mention it to anybody . He got back through the line all right , without questions . " Havep169a good shit ? " the man from the 2d Platoon called to him . " Yeah , " he mumbled and clomped on , down the slope toward the CP . But on his way he was joined by Pfc Doll , on his way down from 1st Platoon with a message to ask again about water . Doll fell in step with him , and immediately noticed his damaged hands and the blood spatters . " Christ ! What happened to your knuckles ? You have a fight with somebody ? " Bead 's heart sank . It would have to be Doll . " No . I slipped and fell and skinned myself , " he said . He was as stiff and sore all over as if he had had a fistfight with somebody . Horror welled in him again , suddenly , ballooningly . He took several very deep breaths into a sore rib cage . Doll grinned with frank but amiable skepticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from your knuckles ? " " Leave me alone , Doll ! " Bead blazed up . " I do nt feel like talking ! So just leave me alone , hunh ? Will you ? " He tried to put into his eyes all the fierce toughness of a man just returned from killing an enemy . He hoped maybe that would shut him up , and it did . At least for a while . They walked on down in silence , Bead aware with a kind of horrified disgust that already he was fitting the killing of the Japanese man into the playing of a role ; a role without anything , no reality , of himself or anything else . It had n't been like that at all . Doll did not stay shut up , though . Doll had been a little taken aback by Bead 's vehemence , a forcefulness he was not used to expecting from Bead . He could smell something when he saw it . And after he had delivered his message , receiving the answer he expected which was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he brought it up again , this time by calling it to the attention of Welsh . Welsh and Storm were sitting on the sides of their holes matching pennies for cigarettes , which were already beginning to be precious . They would match four best out of seven , to lengthen the game and cut down the expense in cigarettes , then both pull out their plastic pack holders which everyone had bought to keep their butts dry and carefully pass the one tube between them . Doll went over to them grinning with his eyebrow raised . Hep170did not feel , at least not at the time , that what he was doing had anything to do with ratting on someone or stooling . " What the fuck happen to your boy there ? Who the hell he beat up with them skinned knuckles and all them blood splatters on him ? Did I miss somethin ? " Welsh looked up at him with that level gaze of his which , when he was n't pretending to be crazy , could be so penetrating . Already , Doll felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering Welsh turned to look at Bead , who sat hunched up by himself on a small rock . He had put back on his equipment . " Bead , come over here ! " Bead got up and came , still hunched , his face drawn . Doll grinned at him with his raised eyebrow . Welsh looked him up and down . " What happened to you ? " " Who ? Me ? " Welsh waited in silence . " Well , I slipped and fell down and skinned myself , that 's all . " Welsh eyed him in silence , thoughtfully . Obviously he was not even bothering with that story . " Where 'd you go a while ago ? When you were gone for a while ? Where were you ? " " I went off to take a crap by myself . " " Wait ! " Doll put in , grinning . " When I seen him , he was comin down from the 2d Platoon 's section of line on the ridge . " Welsh swung his gaze to Doll and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at Bead . Stein , who had been standing nearby , had come closer now and was listening . So had Band and Fife and some of the others . " Lissen , kid , " Welsh said . " I got more problems than I know what to do with in this screwy outfit . Or how to handle . I got no time to fuck around with kid games . I want to know what happened to you , and I want the truth . Look at yourself ! Now , what happened , and where were you ? " Welsh apparently , at least to Bead 's eyes , was much closer to guessing the truth than the unimaginative Doll , or the others . Bead drew a long quavering breath . " Well , I went across the ridge outside the line in the trees to take a crap in private . A Jap guy came up while I was there and hep171tried to bayonet me . And  --  and I killed him . " Bead exhaled a long , fluttering breath , then inhaled sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nevertheless dumbstruck . " Goddam it , kid ! " Welsh bellowed after a moment . " I told you I wanted the goddam fucking truth ! And not no kid games ! " It had never occurred to Bead that he would not be believed . Now he was faced with a choice of shutting up and being taken for a liar , or telling them where and having them see what a shameful botched-up job he 'd done . Even in his upset and distress it did not take him long to choose . " Then god damn you go and look ! " he cried at Welsh . " Do nt take my word , go and look for your goddam fucking self ! " " I 'll go ! " Doll put in immediately . Welsh turned to glare at him . " You 'll go nowhere , stooly , " he said . He turned back to Bead . " I 'll go myself . " Doll had subsided into a stunned , shocked , whitefaced silence . It had never occurred to Doll that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then he had never imagined the result would turn out to be what it apparently had . Bead killing a Jap ! He was not guilty of stooling , and furiously he made up his mind that he was going along ; if he had to crawl . " And if you 're lyin , kid , God help your fucking soul . " Welsh picked up his Thompsongun and put on his helmet . " All right . Where is it ? Come on , show me . " " I 'm not going up there again ! " Bead cried . " You want to go , go by yourself ! But I ai nt going ! And nothin 's gon na make me ! " Welsh stared at him narrowly a moment . Then he looked at Storm . Storm nodded and got up . " Okay , " Welsh said . " Where is it , then ? " " A few yards in the trees beyond the crest , at the middle of the 2d Platoon . Just about in front of Krim 's hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on his helmet and picked up his own Thompson . And suddenly , with the withdrawal of Bead and his emotion from the scene , the whole thing became another larking , kidding excursionof the " Tommygun Club " which had held the infiltratorp172hunt that morning . Stein , who had been listening in silence nearby all the time , dampened it by refusing to allow any of the officers to leave the CP ; but MacTae could go , and it was the three sergeants and Dale who prepared to climb to the crest . Bead could not resist calling a bitter comment from his rock : " You wo n't need all the goddamned artillery , Welsh ! There 's nobody up there now but him ! " But he was ignored . It was just before they departed that Doll , his eyes uneasy but nonetheless steady , presented himself manfully in front of the First Sergeant and gazed at him squarely . " Top , you would n't keep me from goin , would you ? " he asked . It was not begging nor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , level , straightforward question . Welsh stared at him a moment , then without change of expressionturned away silently . It was obviously a reprimand . Doll chose to take it as silent acquiescence . And with himself in the rear the five of them started the climb to the line . Welsh did not send him back . While they were gone no one bothered Bead . He sat by himself on his rock , head down , now and then squeezing his hands or feeling his knuckles . Everyone avoided looking at him , as if to give him privacy . The truth was nobody really knew what to think . As for Bead himself , all he could think about was how shamefully he and his hysterical , graceless killing were going to be exposed . His memory of it , and of that resolute face coming at him , made him shudder and want to gag . More times than not he wished he had kept his mouth shut and let them all think him a crazy liar . It might have been much better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a peculiar look . " He 's there , " Welsh said . " He sure is , " MacTae said . All of them looked curiously subdued . That was all that was said . At least , it was all that was said in front of Bead . What they said away from him , Bead could not know . But he did not find in their faces any of the disgust or horror of him that he had expected . If anything , he found a little of the reverse : admiration . As they separatedto go to their various holes , each made some gesture . Doll had hunted up the Japanese rifle and brought it back forp173Bead . He had scrubbed most of the blood and matter from the buttplatewith leaves and had cleaned up the bayonet . He brought it over and presented it as if presenting an apology offering . " Here , this is yours . " Bead looked at it without feeling anything . " I do nt want it . " " But you won it . And won it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it anyway . What good 's it to me . " " Maybe you can trade it for whiskey . " Doll laid it down . " And here 's his wallet . Welsh said to give it to you . There 's a picture of his ' wife in it . " " Jesus Christ , Doll . " Doll smiled . " There 's pictures of other broads , too , " he hurried on . " Filipino , it looks like . Maybe he was in the Philippines . That 's Filipino writing on the back , Welsh says . " " I do nt want it anyway . You keep it . " But he took the proffered wallet anyway , his curiosity piqued in spite of himself . " Well  --  " He looked at it . It was dark , greasy from much sweating . " I do nt feel good about it , Doll , " he said looking up , wanting suddenly to talk about it to someone . " I feel guilty . " " Guilty ! What the hell for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flow many our guys you think maybe he stuck that bayonet in in the Philippines ? On the Death March . How about those two guys yes-terday ? " " I know all that . But I ca n't help it . I feel guilty . " " But why ! " " Why ! Why ! How the fuck do I know why ! " Bead cried . " Maybe my mother beat me up too many times for jerking off when I was a kid ! " he cried plaintively , with a sudden half-flashing of miserable insight . " How do I know why ! " Doll stared at him uncomprehendingly . " Never mind , " Bead said . " Listen , " Doll said . " If you really do nt want that wallet . " Bead felt a sudden clutching greed . He put the wallet in his pocket quickly . " No . No , I 'll keep it . No , I might as well keep it . " " Well , " Doll said sorrowfully , " I got to get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doll , " he said.  | " Yeah . Sure . " Doll stood up . " I 'll say one thing . When you set out to kill him , you really killed him , " he said admiringly . Bead jerked his head up , his eyes searching . " You think so ? " he said . Slowly he began to grin a little . Doll was nodding , his face boyish with his admiration . " I ai nt the only one . " He turned and left , heading up the slope . Bead stared after him , still not knowing what he really felt . And Doll had said he was n't the only one . If they did not find it such a disgraceful , botched-up job , then at least he need not feel so bad about that . Tentatively he grinned a little wider , a little more expansively , aware that his face felt stiff doing it . A little later on Bugger Stein came over to him . Stein had remained in the background up to now . The news of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , and when messengers or ration details came down from the line , they looked at Bead as though he were a different person . Bead was not sure whether he enjoyed this or not , but had decided that he did . He was not surprised when Stein came over . Bead was sitting on the edge of his hole when Stein appeared , jumped down in and sat down beside him . Nobody else was around . Stein adjusted his glasses in that nervous way he had , the four fingers on top of one frame , the thumb beneath , and then put his hand on Bead 's knee in a fatherly way and turned to look at him . His face was earnest and troubled-looking . " Bead , I know you 've been pretty upset by what happened to you today . That 's unavoidable . Anybody would be . I thought perhaps you might like to talk about it , and maybe relieve yourself a little . I do nt know that what I would have to say to you about it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bead stared at him in astonishment , and Stein , giving his knee a couple of pats , turned and looked sadly off across the basin toward Hill 207 , the command post of yesterday . " Our society makes certain demands and requires certain sacrificesof us , if we want to live in it and partake of its benefits . I 'm not saying whether this is right or wrong . But we really have no choice . We have to do as society demands . One of these demands is the killing of other humans in armed combat in time of war ,  |p175when  our society is being attacked and must defend itself . That was what happened to you today . Only most men who have to do this are luckier than you . They do their first killing at a distance , howeversmall . They have a chance , however small , to get used to it before having to kill hand to hand and face to face . I think I know what you must have felt . " Stein paused . Bead did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he did not say anything . When Stein turned and looked at him for some answer , he said " Yes , sir . " " Well , I just want you to know that you were morally justified in what you did . You had no choice , and you must n't worry or feel guilty about it . You only did what any other good soldier would have done , for our country or any other . " Bead listened incredulously . When Stein paused again , he did not know what to say so he did n't say anything . Stein looked off across the basin . " I know it 's tough . You and I may have had our little differences , Bead . But I want you to know  --  " his voice choked slightly  --  " I want you to know that after this war is over , if there is anything I can ever do for you , just get in touch with me . I 'll do everything I possibly can to help you . " Without looking at Bead he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bead stared after him , as he had done after Doll . He still did not know what he really felt . Nobody told him anything that made any sense . But he realized now , quite suddenly , that he could survive the killing of many men . Because already the immediacy of the act itself , only minutes ago so very sharp , was fading . He could look at it now without pain , perhaps even with pride , in a way , because now it was only an idea like a scene in a play , and did not really hurt anyone . He was not given much time to speculate on this point , however . By the time Stein , in leaving Bead 's hole , had arrived back at his own , the messenger with tomorrow 's dispositions had arrived and was waiting for him . They were to move out immediately , down into the basin and around the curve of the ridge , as soon as the reserve battalion could take over for them.  |p176They  already knew of course that 2d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battered and broken companies moving back along the slopes . There was only one logical answer to this . C-for-Charlie however had prefered not to believe it . Now it had come . The relief platoons began to come in fifteen minutes later , smiling and obsequious , somehow guiltyfaced . C-for-Charlie was already packed and was glad to get away from them quickly . There was no point in talking about it . One by one the squads came down from the top past the CP and continued on down , angling off across the steep slope toward the bottom . At the head of the basin where Hill 209 cut across the fall of the land like a dam , the bottom was much less deep than further down , perhaps only fifty yards from the crest , and this was where they were to congregate . The HQ and the mortars left last , following the platoons . There had been very little to pack . The incoming platoons still carried their combatpacks , complete with meatcan , entrenching tool , raincoat , etc . C-for-Charlies had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pocket , and had his entrenching tool hooked to his belt . A few lugged their raincoats along over one shoulder . Bugger Stein and his opposite number , when Stein made the official turnover , reacted exactly as their troops had . The other captain , a man of Stein 's age , smiled apologetically and offered his hand which Stein took perfunctorily . " Good luck ! " he called softly as Stein moved off after his men . Stein , with a lump of excitement and tension filling his throat , did not think it worth the effort to swallow one half and cough up the other in order to make a pointlessanswer , and only bobbed his head without looking back . He , like his men , only wanted to get away quickly , and especially without having to talk . But down in the bottom they found others who wanted to talk to them . Bars of I ) ration chocolate were pressed upon them by the reserve platoons stationed there . They were given first pick at the C rations for their suppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By now it was almost dark , and over an hour was consumed in making sure each man had two full canteens of water . Stein and the officers went off for a flashlight briefing in a smallP177ditch with Colonel Tall , an older man though not as much older as the generals , lean and boyish and burrheaded , a West Pointer . He had been trained in all this as his life work . They came back looking solemn . Tall had told them the corps commander as well as the division commander would be watching tomorrow . Men spread themselves out in holes dug by other , unknown men or in little erosion ditches and tried to force sleep upon bodies which kept shooting messages of reluctance along humming nerves . In the night it rained only once , but it was a very hard rain which wet everyone to the skin , and woke those who had managed to doze.  |p178DAWN  CAME , AND PASSED , AND STILL THEY WAITED . The roses and blues of the dawn light changed to the pearl and misty greys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nervously ready , since long before dawn . But for today Colonel Tall had requested a new artillery wrinkle . Because of yesterday 's heavy repulse , Tall had asked for , and got , an artillery time-ontarget " shoot . " This device , an artillery technique left over from World War I , was a method of calculating so that the first rounds of every battery hit their various targets simultaneously . Under TOT fire men caught in the open would suddenly find themselves enveloped in a curtain of murderous fire without the usual warning of a few shells arriving early from the nearest guns . The thing to do was to wait a bit , play poker with them , try to catch them when they were out of their holes for breakfast or an early morning stretch . So they waited . Along the crest the silent troops stared across a silent ravine to the silent hilltop , and the silent hill stared back . C-for-Charlie , waiting with the assault companies on the slope below , could not even see this much . Nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unspeakable insularity , so many separate small islands . To their right and to their left A-for-Able and B-for-Baker did the same . At exactly twenty-two minutes after first daylight Colonel Tall 's requested TOT fire struck , an earthcracking , solidly tangible ,  |p179continuous  roar on Hill 21o . The artillery fired three-minute concentrationsat irregular intervals , hoping to catch the survivors out of their holes . Twenty minutes later , and before the barrage itself was ended , whistles began to blow along the crest of Hill 209 . The assault companies had no recourse except to begin to move . Minds cast frantically about for legitimate last minute excuses , and found none . In the men themselves nervous fear and anxiety , containedso long and with such effort in order to appear brave , now began to come out in yelled exhortations and yelps of gross false enthusiasm . They moved up the slope ; and in bunches , crouchinglow and carrying their rifles in one or both hands , they hopped over the crest and commenced to run sideways and crouching down the short forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men in the line shouted encouragement to them as they passed through . A small cheer , dwarfed by the distant mountains , rose and died . A few slapped some of them toughly on the shoulder as they went through . Men who would not die today winked lustily. at men who , in some cases , would soon be dead . On C-for-Charlie 's right fifty yards away A-for-Able was going through an identical ritual . They were rested . At least , they were comparatively so ; they had not had to stand watch one half of the night , and they had not been up on the line where jitters precluded sleep , but down below , protected . And they had been fed . And watered . If few of them had slept much , at least they were better off than the men on the line . Corporal Fife was one of those who had slept the least . He still could not get over little Bead 's having killed that Jap like that . What with that , the rain , the total lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the morrow , he had only dozed once for about five minutes . But the loss of sleep did not bother him . He was young , and healthy , and fairly strong . In fact , he had never felt healthier or in better shape in his life ; and earlier in the day , in the first gray of early light , he had stood forth upon the slope and , exuding energy and vitality , had looked a long time down the ravine as it fell and deepened toward the rear until he wanted to spread wide his arms with sacrifice and love of life and love of men . He did n't do it of course . There were men awake all round him . But he had wanted to . And now as he dropped over the ridge and into thep180beginning of the battle , he shot one swift look behind him , one last look , and found himself staring headon into the wide , brown , spectacle-coveredeyes of Bugger Stein , who happened to be right behind him . What a hell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never seen such a deep , dark , intense , angrily haunted look as that which Fife bent on him as they dropped over the ridge , and Stein thought it was directed at him . At him , personally . They two were almost the last to go . Only Sergeant Welsh and young Bead remained behind them . And when Stein looked back , they were coming , hunched low , chopping with their feet , sliding down the shale and dirt of the slope . Stein 's dispositions had been the same today as in the two previous days . They had done nothing much and he saw no reason to change the march order : 1st Platoon first , 2d Platoon second , 3d in reserve . One of the two machineguns went with each forward platoon ; the mortars would stay with the Company HQ and the reserve . That was the way they had moved out . And as Stein slid to the bottom of 209 's short forward slope he could see 1st Platoon pass out of sight beyond one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance . They were about a hundred yards ahead and appeared to be deployed well . There were three of these little folds in the ground . All of them were perpendicular to the south face of Hill 209 , parallel to each other . It had been Stein 's idea , when inspecting the terrain with Colonel Tall the evening before , to utilize these as cover by shoving off from the right end of the hill and then advancing left across them and across his own front  --  instead of getting himself caught in the steeper ravine immediately between the two hills , as had happened to Fox Co . Tall had agreed to this . Afterward , Stein had briefed his own officers on it . Kneeling just behind the crest with them in the fading light , he pointed it all out and they looked it over . Somewhere in the dusk a sniper 's rifle had spat angrily . One by one they inspected it through binoculars . The third and furthest left of these three folds was about a hundred and fifty yards from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This slope steepened as it climbed to the U-shaped eminence of the Elephant 's Head , which from five hundred yardsp181beyond commanded and brooded over the entire area . This hundred and fifty yard low area , as well as the third fold , was dominated by two lesser , grassy ridges growing out of the slope and two hundred yards apart , one on either side of the low area . Both ridges were at right angles to the folds of ground and parallel to the line of advance . With these in their hands plus the Elephant 's Head , the Japanese could put down a terrible fire over the whole approach area . Tall 's plan was for the forward elements to move up onto these two ridges , locating and eliminating the hidden strong points there which had stopped 2d Battalion yesterday , and then with the reserve company to reinforce them , work their way up the Elephant 's Neck to take the The Head . This was the Bowling Alley . But there was no way to outflank it . On the left it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right the Japanese held the jungle in force . It had to be taken frontally . All of this Stein had lined out for his officers last evening . Now they were preparing to execute it . Stein , at the bottom of the shale slope , could see very little of anything . A great racketing of noise had commenced and hung everywherein the air without seeming to have-any source . Part of course was due to his own side firing all along the line , and the bombardmentand the mortars . Perhaps the Japanese were firing too now . But he could see no visual signs of it . What time was it , anyway ? Stein looked at his watch , and its little face stared back at him with an intensity it had never had before . 6:45 ; a quarter to seven in the morning . Back home he would be just  --  Stein realized he had never really seen his watch . He forced himself to put his arm down . Directly in front of him his reserve 3d Platoon were spread out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ground . With them were the Company HQ and the mortar section . Most of them were looking at him with faces as intense as his watch 's face . Stein ran crouching over to them , his equipment bouncing and banging on him , shouting for them to set up the mortars there , motioning with his hand . Then he realized that he could only just barely hear his own voice himself , with all this banging and racketing of doom bouncing around in the air . How could they hear him ? He wondered how the 1st Platoon  --  and the 2d  --  were doing , and how he could see.  |p182The  1st Platoon , at that particular moment , was spread out and flattened behind the middle of the three little folds of ground . Behind it the 2d Platoon was spread out and flattened in the low between the folds . Nobody really wanted to move . Young Lt Whyte had already looked over the area between this fold and the third and seen nothing , and he already had motioned for his two scouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using an additional hand-and-arm signal meaning " speed . " The booming and banging and racketing in the air was bothering Whyte , too . It did not seem to come from any one place or several places , but simply hung and jounced in the air , sourceless . He too could see no visual end results of so much banging and exploding . His two scouts still not having moved , Whyte became angry and opened his mouth and bellowed at them , motioning again . They could not hear him of course , but he knew they could see the black open hole of his mouth . Both of them stared at him as though they thought him insane for even suggesting such a thing , but this time , after a moment , they moved . Almost side by side they leaped up , crossed the crest of the little fold , and ran crouching down to the low where they flattened themselves . After a moment they leaped up again , one a little behind the other , and ran bent almost double to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another moment and a perfunctory peek over its top , they motioned Whyte to come on . Whyte jumped up making a sweeping forward motion with his arm and ran forward , his platoon behind him . As the ist Platoon moved , making the crossing as the scouts had : in two rushes , the 2d Platoon moved to the top of the middle fold . Back at the first fold of ground Stein had seen this move and been a little reassured by it . Creeping close to the top of the fold among his men , he had raised himself to his knees to see , his face and whole patches of his skin twitching with mad alarm in an effort to call his insanity to his attention . When nothing hit him immediately , he stayed up , standing on his knees , to see ist Platoon leave the middle fold and arrive at the crest of the third . At least they had got that far . Maybe it would n't be so bad . He lay back down , feeling quite proud , and realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intently . He felt even prouder . Behind him , in the low of the fold , the mortar squads were setting up their mortars.  |p183Crawling  back to them through the infernal racketing still floating loose in the air , he shouted in Culp 's ear for him to make the lefthandgrassy ridge his target . At the mortars Private Mazzi , the Italian boy from the Bronx , stared at him with wide , frightened eyes . So did most of the others . Stein crawled back to the top of the told . He arrived , and raised himself , just in time to see 1st Platoon and then 2d Platoon attack . He was the only man along the top of the first fold who did see it , because he was the only man who was not flattened on the ground . He bit his lip . Even from here he could tell that it was bad , a serious tactical blunder . If tactical blunder it was , the fault was Whyte 's . First Whyte , and secondly , Lt Tom Blane of the 2d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third and last fold of ground without a casualty . This in itself seemed strange to him , if not highly overoptimistic . He knew his orders : he was to locate and eliminate the hidden strong points on the two grassy ridges . The nearest of these , the righthand one , had its rather sharply defined beginnings about eighty yards to his right front . While his men flattened themselves and stared at him with intense sweating faces , he raised himself cautiously on his elbows till only his eyes showed , and inspected the terrain . Before him the ground fell , sparsely grassed and rocky , until it reached the beginnings of the little ridge , where it immediately became thickly grassed with the brown , waist-high grass . He could not see anything that looked like Japanese or their emplacements . Whyte was scared , but his anxiety to do well today was stronger . He did not really believe he would be killed in this war . Briefly he glanced over his shoulder to the ridge of Hill 209 where groups of men stood half-exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The loud banging and racketing hanging sourceless in the air had abated somewhat , had raised itself a few yards , after the lifting of the barrage from the little ridges to the Elephant 's Head . Again Whyte looked at the terrain and then motioned his scouts forward . Once again the two riflemen stared at him as though they thought he had lost his mind , as though they would have liked to reason with him if they had n't feared losing their reputations . Again Whyte motionedthem forward , jerking his arm up and down in the signal for speed . The men looked at each other , then , gathering themselves onp184hands and knees first , bounced up and sprinted twenty-five yards down into the low area and fell flat . After a moment in which they inspected and found themselves still alive , they gathered themselves again . On hands and knees , preparing to rise , the first one suddenly fell down flat and bounced ; the second , a little way behind him , got a little further up so that when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . And there they lay , both victims of well placed rifle shots by unseen riflemen . Neither moved again . Both were obviously dead . Whyte stared at them shocked . He had known them almost four months . He had heard no shots nor had he seen anythingmove . No bullets kicked up dirt anywhere in front . Again he stared at the quiet , masked face of the deserted little ridge . What was he supposed to do now ? The high , sourceless racketing in the air seemed to have gotten a little louder . Whyte , who was a meaty , big young man , had been a champion boxer and champion judoman at his university where he was preparing himself to be a marine biologist , as well as having been the school 's best swimmer . Anyway , they ca n't get all of us , he thought loyally , but meaning principally himself , and made his decision . " Come on , boys ! Let 's go get ' em ! " he yelled and leaped to his feet motioning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their bayonets fixed since early morning right behind him , and fell down dead , stitched diagonally from hip to shoulder by bullets , one of which exploded his heart . He had just time enough to think that something had hurt him terribly , not even enough to think that he was dead , before he was . Perhaps he screamed . Five others of his platoon went down with him almost simultaneously , in various states of disrepair , some dead , some only nicked . But the impetus Whyte had inaugurated remained , and the platoon charged blindly on . Another impetus would be needed to stop it or change its direction . A few more men went down . Invisible rifles and machineguns hammered from what seemed to be every quarter of the globe . After reaching the two dead scouts , they came in range of the more distant left ridge , which took them with a heavy crossfire . Sergeant Big Queen , running with the rest and bellowing incoherently , and who had only been promoted two days before after the defection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , throw his rifle from him as though he feared it , and go clown hollering and clawing at his chest . Queen did not even think about it . Near him Pfc Doll ran too , blinking his eyes rapidly as though this might protect him . His mind had withdrawn completely in terror , and he did not think at all . Doll 's sense of personal invulnerabilitywas having a severe test , but had not as yet , like Whyte 's , failed . They were past the dead scouts now . More men on the left were beginning to go down . And behind them over the top of the third fold , suddenly , came the 2d Platoon in full career , yelling hoarsely . This was the responsibility of 2d Lt Blane . It was not a particularly complex responsibility . It had nothing to do with envy , jealousy , paranoia , or suppressed self-destruction . He too , like Whyte , knew what his orders were , and he had promised Bill Whyte he would back him up and help him out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he too wanted to do well today . Not as athletic as his fellow worker , but more imaginative , more sensitive , he too leaped up and motioned his men forward , when he saw 1st Platoon move . He could see the whole thing finished in his imagination : himself and Whyte and their men standing atop the bombed out bunkers in proper triumph , the position captured . He too died on the forward slope but not at the crest like Whyte . It took several seconds for the still-hidden Japanese gunners to raise their fire , and 2d Platoon was ten yards down the gentle little slope before it was unleashed against them . Nine men fell at once . Two died and one of them was Blane . Not touched by a machinegun , he unluckily was chosen as target by three separate riflemen , none of whom knew about the others or that he was an officer , and all of whom connected . He bounced another five yards forward , and with three bullets through his chest cavity did not die right away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numb , stared at the high , beautiful , pure white cumuli which sailed like stately ships across the sunny , cool blue tropic sky . It hurt him a little when he breathed . He was dimly aware that he might possibly die as he became unconscious. 2d Platoon had just reached the two dead 1st Platoon scouts when mortar shells began to drop in onto the 1st Platoon twenty-five yards ahead . First two , then a single , then three together popped up iup186unbelievable mushrooms of dirt and stones . Chards and pieces whickered and whirred in the air . It was the impetus needed either to change the direction of the blind charge or to stop it completely . It did both . In the 2d Platoon S/Sgt Keck , watched by everyone now with Lt Blane down , threw out his arms holding his rifle at the balance , dug in his heels and bellowed in a voice like the combined voices of ten men for them to " Hit dirt ! Hit dirt ! " 2d Platoon needed no urging . Running men melted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blown them over like dried stalks . In the 1st Platoon , less lucky , reaction varied . On the extreme right the line had reached the first beginning slope of the righthand ridge , long hillock really , and a few men  --  perhaps a squad  --  turned and dove into the waisthigh grass there , defilading themselves from the hidden MGs above them as well as protecting them from the mortars . On the far left that end had much further to go , seventy yards more , to reach dead space under the lefthand ridge ; but a group of men tried to make it . None of them reached it , however . They were hosed to earth and hiding by the machineguns above them , or bowled over stunned by the mortars , before they could defilade themselves from the MGs or get close enough to them to escape the mortars . Just to the left of the center was the attached machinegun squad from Culp 's platoon , allowed to join the charge by Whyte through forgetfulness or for some obscure tactical reason of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were knocked down by the same mortar shell , gun and tripod and ammo boxes all going every which way and bouncing end over end , although not one of the five was wounded by it . These marked the furthest point of advance . On the extreme left five or six riflemen were able to take refuge in a brushy draw at the foot of Hill toy which , a little further down , became the deep ravine where Fox and George had been trapped and hit yesterday . " These men began to fire at the two grassy ridges although they could see no targets . In the center of 1st Platoon 's line there were no defilades or draws to run to . The middle , before the mortars stopped them , had run itselfright on down and out onto the dangerous low area , where they could not only be enfiladed by the ridges but could also be hit by MG plunging fire from Hill 210 itself . Here there was nothing to dop187but get down and hunt holes . Fortunately the TOT barrage had searched here as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 155 holes available . Men jostled each other for them , shared them . The late Lt Whyte 's 19th Century charge was over . The mortar rounds continued to drop here and there across the area , searching flesh , searching bone . Private John Bell of the 2d Platoon lay sprawled exactly as his body had skidded to a halt , without moving a muscle . He could not see because his eyes were shut , but he listened . On the little ridges he prolonged yammering of the MGs had stopped and now confined itself to short bursts at specific targets . Here and there wounded men bellowed , whined or whimpered . Bell 's face was turned left , his cheek pressed to the ground , and he tried not even to breath too conspicuously for fear of calling attention to himself . Cautiously he opened his eyes , half afraid the movement of eyelids would be seer ; by a machine gunner a hundred yards away , and found himself staring into the open eyes of the 1st Platoon 's first scout lying dead live yards to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a young Graeco-'I'urkish draftee named Kral . Kral was noted for two things , the ugliest bentnosed face in the regiment and the thickest glasses in C-for-Charlie . That with such a myopia he could be a scout was a joke of the company . But Kral had volunteered for it ; he wanted to be where the action was , he said ; in peace or in war . A hep kid from Jersey , he had nevertheless believed the four-color propaganda leaflets . He had not known that the profession of first scout of a rifle platoon was a thing of the past and belonged in the Indian Wars , not to the massed divisions , superior firepower , and tighter socialcontrol of today . First target , the term should be , not first scout , and now the big glasses still reposed on his face . They had not fallen off . But something about their angle , at least from where Bell lay , magnified the open eyes until they filled the entire lenses . Bell could not help staring fixedly at them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The more Bell stared at them the more he felt them to be holes into the center of the universe and that he might fall in through them to go drifting down through starry space amongst galaxies and spiral nebulae and island universes . He remembered he used to think of his wife 's cunt like that , in a morep188pleasant way . Forcibly Bell shut his eyes . But he was afraid to move his head , and whenever he opened them again , there Kral 's eyes were , staring at him their droll and flaccid message of amiable good will , sucking at him dizzyingly . And wherever he looked they followed him , pleasantly but stubbornly . From above , invisible but there , the fiery sun heat of the tropic day heated his head inside his helmet , making his soul limp . Bell had never known such eviscerating , ballshrinking terror . Somewhere out of his sight anothermortar shell exploded . But in general the day seemed to have become very quiet . His arm with his watch on it lay within his range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 7:45 ? Defeatedly he let his eyes go hack where they wanted : to Kral 's . HERE LIES FOUR-EYES KRAL , DIED FOR SOMETHING . When one of Kral 's huge eyes winked at him waggishly , he knew in desperation he had to do something , although he had been lying there only thirty seconds . Without moving , his cheek still pressed to earth , he yelled loudly . " Hey , Keck ! " He waited . " Hey , Keck ! We got to get out of here ! " " I know it , " came the muffled answer . Keck was obviously lying with his head turned the other way and had no intention of moving it . " What 'll we do ? " " Well . . . " There was silence while Keck thought . It was interrupted by a high , quavery voice from a long way off . " We know you there , Yank . Yank , we know you there . " " Tojo cats shit ! " Keck yelled . He was answered by an angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " the faraway voice screamed . " You goddam right he does ! " some frightened Republican called from Bell 's blind right side . When the firing stopped , Bell called again . " What 'll we do , Keck ? " " Listen , " came the muffled answer . " All you guys listen . Pass it along so everybody knows . " He waited and there was a muffled chorus " Now get this . When I holler go , everybody up . Load and lock and have a nuther clip in yore hand . 1st and 3d Squads stay put , kneeling position , and fire covering fire . 2d and 4th Squads hightail it backp189over that little fold . 1st and 3d Squads fire two clips , then scoot. 2d and 4th fire covering fire from that fold . If you ca n't see nothin , fire searching fire . Space yore shots . Them positions is somewhere about half way up them ridges . Everybody fire at the righthand ridge which is closer . You got that ? " He waited while everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everybody got it ? " Keck called muffledly . There were no answers . " Then  --  GO ! " he bellowed . The slope came to life . Bell , in the 2d Squad , did not even bother with the brave man 's formality of looking about to see if the plan was working , but instead squirmed around and leaped up running , his legs already pistoning before the leap came down to earth . Safe beyond the little fold of ground , which by now had taken on characteristicsof huge size , he whirled and began to fire cover , terribly afraid of being stitched across the chest like Lt Whyte who lay only a few yards away . Methodically he drilled his shots into the dun hillside which still hid the invisible , yammering MGs , one round to the right , one to the left , one to center , one to the left . . . He could not believe that any of them might actually hit somebody . If one did , what a nowhere way to go : killed by accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probability , by the calculated chance of searching fire , even as he himelf might be at any moment . Mathematics ! Mathematics ! Algebra ! Geometry ! When 1st and 3d Squads came diving and tumbling back over the tiny crest , Bell was content to throw himself prone , press his cheek to the earth , shut his eyes , and lie there . God , oh , God ! Why am I here ? Why am I here ? After a moment 's thought , he decided he better change it to : why are we here . That way , no agency of retribution could exact payment from him for being selfish . Apparently Keck 's plan had worked very well . 2d and 4th Squads , having the surprise , had gotten back untouched ; and 1st and 3d Squads had had only two men hit . Bell had been looking right at one of them . Running hard with his head down , the man ( a boy , named Kline ) had jerked his head up suddenly , his eyes wide with start and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth a round pursed hole in his face , and had gone down . Sick at himself for it , Bell had feltp190laughter burbling up in his chest . He did not know whether Kline was killed or wounded . The MGs had stopped yammering . Now , in the comparative quiet and fifty yards to their front , 1st Platoon was down and invisible amongst their shell holes and sparse grass . Anguished , frightened cries of " Medic ! Medic ! " were beginning to be raised now here and there across the field , and 2d Platoon having escaped were slowly realizing that they were not after all very safe even here . Back at the CP behind the first fold Stein was not alone in seeing the tumbling , pellmell return of the 2d Platoon to the third fold . Seeing that their Captain could safely stand up on his knees without being pumped full of holes or mangled , others were now doing it . He was setting them a pretty good example , Stein thought , still a little astonished by his own bravery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he decided , and called his two company aidmen to him . " You two fellows better get on up there , " Stein yelled to them above the racket . " I expect they need you . " That sounded calm and good . " Yes , sir , " one of them said . That was the scholarly , bespectacled one , the senior . They looked at each other seriously . " I 'll try to get stretcherbearers to the low between here and the second fold , to help you , " Stein shouted . " See if you ca n't drag them back that far . " He stood up on his knees again to peer forward , at where now and then single mortar shells geysered here and there beyond the third fold . " Go by rushes if you think you have to , " he added inconclusively . They disappeared . " I need a runner . " Stein bawled , looking toward the line of his men who had had both the sense and the courage to climb to their knees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the whole little line rolled their eyes to look at hint or turned toward him their heads . But not a single figure moved to come forward or answered him . Stein stared back at them , disbelieving . He was aware he had misjudged them completely , and he felt like a damned fool . He had expected to be swamped by volunteers . A sinking terror took hold of him : if he could be that wrong about this , what else might he not be wrong about ? His enthusiasm had betrayed him . To save face he looked away , trying to pretend he had not expected any/thing . But it was n't soon enough and he knew they knew . Not quite sure what to do next , he was saved the trouble of deciding : a wraithlike , ghostly figure appeared at his elbow . " I 'll go , Sir . " It was Charlie Dale the second cook , scowling with intensity , his lace dark and excited . Stein told him what he wanted about the stretcherbearers , and then watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slope of Hill 209 which he would have to climb . Stein had no idea where he had been , or where he had come from so suddenly . He could not remember seeing him all day today until now . Certainly he had not been one of the line of kneeling standees . Stein looked back at them , somewhat restored . Dale . He must remember that . There were now twelve men standing on their knees along the little fold of ground , trying to see what was going on up front . Young Corporal Fife was not , however , one of these . Fife was one of the ones who stayed flattened out , and he was as absolutely flattened as he could get . While Stein stood above him on his knees observing , Fife lay with his knees drawn up and his ear to the soundpower phone Stein had given him care of , and he did not care if he never stood up or ever saw anything . Earlier , when Stein had first done it with his stupid pleased pride shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand straight up on his knees for several seconds , in order that no one might tag him with the title of coward . But he felt that was enough . Anyway , his curiosity was not at all piqued . All he had seen , when he did get up , was the top two feet of a dirt mushroom from a mortar shell landing beyond the third fold . What the fuck was so great about that ? Suddenly a spasm of utter hopelessness shook Fife . Helplessness , that was what he felt ; complete helplessness . He was as helpless as if agents of his government had bound him hand and foot and delivered him here and then gone back to wherever it was good agents went . Maybe a Washington cocktail bar , with lots of cunts all around . And here he lay , as bound and tied by his own mental processes and social indoctrination as if they were ropes , simply because while he could admit to himself privately that he was a coward , he did not have the guts to admit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smarter minds of his society had anticipated he would react . They were ahead of him all down the line . And he was powerless to change . It was frustrating , maddening , like a brick wall all around him that he could neither bust through nor leap over and at the same time  --  making it even worse  --  there was his knowledge that there was really no wall at all . If early this morning he had been full of self-sacrifice , he now no longer was . He did not want to be here . He did not want to be here at all . He wanted to be over there where the generals were standing up on the ridge in complete safety , watching . Sweating with fear and an unbelievable tension of doublemindedness , Fife looked over at them and if looks of hatred could kill they would all have fallen down dead and the campaign would be over until they shipped in some new ones . If only he could go crazy . Then he would not be responsible . Why could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un-stone of the stone wall immediately rose up around him denying him exit . He could only lie here and be stretched apart on this rack of double-mindedness . Off to the right , some yards beyond the last man of the reserve platoon , Fife 's eyes recorded for him the images of Sergeants Welsh and Storm crouched behind a small rock outcrop . As he watched , Storm raised his arm and pointed . Welsh snaked his rifle onto the top of the rock and checking the stock , fired off five shots . Both peered . Then they looked at each other and shrugged . It was an easily understood little pantomime . Fife fell into an intense rage . Cowboys and Indians ! Cowboys and Indians ! Everybody 's playing cowboys and Indians ! Just as if these were n't real bullets , and you could n't really get killed . Fife 's head burned with a fury so intense that it threatened to blow all his mental fuses right out through his cars in two bursts of black smoke . his rage was broken off short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the buzzing whistle of the soundpower phone in his ear . Startled , Fife cleared his throat , shocked into wondering whether he could still talk , alter so long . It was the first time he had tried a word since leaving the ridge . It was also the first time he had ever heard this damn phone thing work . He pushed the button and cupped it to his mouth . " Yes ? " he said cautiously . " What do you mean , yes ' ? " a calm cold voice said , and waited . Fife hung suspended in a great empty black void , trying to think.  |p193What  had he meant ? " I mean this is Charlie Cat Seven , " he said , remembering the code jargon . " Over . " " That 's better , " the calm voice said . This is Seven Cat Ace . " That meant 1st Battalion , the HQ . " Colonel Tall here . I want Captain Stein . Over . " " Yes , Sir , " Fife said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tug at the skirt of Stein 's green fatigue blouse . Stein looked down , staring , as if he had never seen Fife before . Or anybody else . " Colonel Tall wants you . " Stein lay down ( glad to flatten himself , Fife noted with satisfaction ) and took the phone . Despite the racketing din overhead , both he and Fife beside him could hear the Colonel clearly . When he accepted the phone and pushed down the button , Bugger Stein was already casting about for his explanations . He had not expected to be called upon to recite so soon , and he had not prepared his lessons . What he could say would of course depend on Tall 's willingness to allow any explanation at all . He could not help being a guilty schoolboy about to be birched . " Charlie Cat Seven . Stein , " he said . " Over . " He released the button . What he heard astounded him to speechlessness . " Magnificent , Stein , magnificent . " Tall 's clear cold calm boyish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  rimed over with a crust of clear cold boyish enthusiasm . " The finest thing these old eyes have seen in a long time . In a month of Sundays . " Stein had a vivid mental picture of Tall 's closecropped , boyish , Anglo-Saxon head and unlined , Anglo-Saxon face . Tall was less than two years older than Stein . His clear , innocent , boyish eyes were the youngest Stein had seen in some time . " Beautifully conceived and beautifully executed . You 'll be mentioned in Battalion Orders , Stein . Your men came through for you beautifully . Over . " Stein pressed the button , managed a weak " Yes , Sir . Over , " and released the button . He could not think of anything else to say . " Best sacrificial commitment to develop a hidden position I have ever seen outside maneuvers . Young Whyte led beautifully . I 'm mentioning him , too . I saw him go down in that first melee . Was he hurt very bad ? But sending in your 2d too was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridges with luck . I dontp194think they were hurt too bad . Blanc led well too . His withdrawal was very old pro . How many of the emplacements did they locate ? Did they knock out any ? We ought to have those ridges cleaned out by noon . Over . " Stein listened , rapt , staring into the eyes of Fife who listened also , staring back . For Fife the calm , pleasant , conversational tone of Col Tall was both maddening and terrifying . And for Stein it was like hearing a radio report on the fighting in Africa which he knew nothing about . Once in school his father had called him long distance to brag about a good report card which Stein had thought would be bad . Neither listener betrayed what he thought to the other , and the silence lengthened . " Hello ? Hello ? Hello , Stein ? Over ? " Stein pressed the button . " Yes , Sir . Here , Sir . Over " Stein releasedthe button . " Thought you 'd been hit , " Tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many of the emplacements did they locate ? And did they knock any of them out ? Over . " Stein pressed the button , staring into the wide eyes of Fife as if he might see Tall on the other side of them . " I do nt know . Over . " He released the button . " What do you mean you do nt know ? How can you not know ? " Tall 's cool , calm , conversational voice said . " Over . " Stein was in a quandary . He could admit what both he and Fife knew , or perhaps Fife did not know , which was that he knew nothing about Whyte 's attack , had not ordered it , and until now had believedit bad . Or he could continue to accept credit for it and try to explain his ignorance of its results . FIe could not , of course , know that Tall would later change his opinion . With a delicacy of sensibilityStein had never expected to see at all in the army , and certainly not on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked away , hall turned his head . He was still listening , but at least he was pretending not to . Stein pressed the button , which was a necessity , but which was beginning to madden him . " I 'm back here , " he said sharply . " Behind the third fold.  | " Do you want me to stand up ? And wave ? So you can see me ? " he added with caustic anger . " Over . " " No , " Tall 's voice said calmly , the irony lost on him . " I can see where you are . I want you to do something . I want you to get up there and see what the situation is , Stein . I want Hill 2io in my hands tonight . And to do that I have to have those two ridges by noon . Have you forgotten the corps commander is here observing today ? He 's got Admiral Barr with him , flown in specially . The Admiral got up at dawn for this . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said crisply . " Over and out . " Stein continued to listen , gripping the phone and staring off furiously , though he knew nothing more was forthcoming . Finally he reached out and tapped Fife and gave it to him . Fife took it in silence . Stein rolled to his feet and ran crouching back down to where the mortars were periodically firing off rounds with their weird , other-world , lingering gonglike sound . " Doing any good ? " he bellowed in Culp 's ear . " We 're getting bursts on both ridges , " Culp bellowed back in his amiable way . " I decided to put one tube onto the right ridge , " he said parenthetically , and then shrugged . " But I do nt know if we 're doin any damage . If they 're dug in  --  " He let it trail off and shrugged again . " I 've decided to move forward to the second fold , " Stein yelled . " Will that be too close for you ? " Culp strode three paces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see over the crest , squinting . He came back . " No . It 's pretty close , but I think we can still hit . But we 're runnin pretty low on ammo . If we keep on firing at this rate  --  " Again he shrugged . " Send everybody but your sergeants back for fresh ammo . All they can carry . Then follow us . " " They do nt any of them like to carry them aprons , " Culp yelled . " They all say if they get hit with one of those things on them ... " " God damn it , Bob ! I ca n't be bothered with a thing like that at a time like this ! They knew what they were gon na have to carry ! " " I know it . " Culp shrugged . " Where do you want me ? " Stein thought . " On the right , I guess . If they locate you , they'llp196try to hit you . I want you away from the reserve platoon . I 'll give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrol in on our flank . Anything that looks like more than a patrol , you let me know quick . " " Do nt worry ! " Culp said . He turned to his squads . Stein trotted off to the right , where he had seen Al Gore , Lt of his 3d Platoon , motioning at the same time for Sgt Welsh to come over to him . Welsh came , followed by Storm , for the orders conference . Even Welsh , Stein noticed parenthetically , even Welsh had that strained , intent , withdrawn look on his face  --  like a greasy patina of guilty wishful thinking . While 3d Platoon and Stein 's Company HQ were trooping forward in two parallel single files in their move to the second fold , the 1st Platoon continued to lie in its shellholes . After the first crash and volley and thunder of mortars they all had expected to be dead in five minutes . Now , it seemed unbelievable but the Japanese did not seem to be able to see them very well . Now and then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a second or so by the sound of its firing . Mortar rounds still sighed down on them , exploding with roaring mushrooms of terror and dirt . But in general the Japanese seemed to be waiting for something . 1st Platoon was willing to wait with them . Leaderless , pinned down , pressing its hands and sweating faces to the dirt , 1st Platoon was willing to wait forever and never move again . Many prayed and promised God they would go to church services every Sunday . But slowly , they began to realize that they could move around , could fire back , that death was not a foregone conclusion and inevitable for all . The medics helped with this . The two company aidmen , given their orders by Stein , had moved up amongst 2d Platoon along the third fold , and had begun little sorties out onto the shallow slope after wounded . In all there were 15 wounded men , and 6 dead . The two aidmen ( lid not bother with the dead , but slowly they retrieved for the stretcherbearers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious and bespectacled , the two of them moved up and down the slope , bandaging and salting , dragging and halfcarrying . Mortar shells knocked them down , MG fire kicked up dirt around them , but nothing touched them . Both would be deadp197before the week was out ( and replaced by types much less admired in C-for-Charlie ) , but for now they clumped untouchably on , two sobersides concerned with aiding the sobbing , near-helpless men it was their official duty to aid . Eventually enough ist Platoon men raised their heads high enough to see them , and realized movement was possible  --  at least , as long as they did not all stand up in a body and wave and shout " Here we are ! " Not one of them had as yet seen a single Japanese . It was Doll who saw the first ones . Sensing the movement around him as men began to stir and call softly to each other , Doll took his bruised confidence in hand and raised his head until his eyes showed above the slight depression into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the rear of the little lefthand ridge , just where it joined the rocky rim slope up to Hill 210 . He saw three figures carrying what could only be a machinegun still attached to its tripod start across the slope back toward Hill 210 , running bent over at the waist in the same identical way he himself had run up here . Doll was astounded and did not believe it . They were about two hundred yards away , and the two men behind ran together carrying the gun , while the man in front simply ran , carrying nothing . Doll slid his rifle up , raised the sight four clicks and , lying with only his left arm and shoulder outside his little hole , sighted on the man in front , leading him a little , and squeezed off a shot . The rifle bucked his shoulder and the man went down . The two men behind jumped sideways together , like a pair of skittish , delicatelycoordinated horses , and ran on . They did not drop the gun , and they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doll fired again and missed . He realized his mistake now : if he had hit one of the men with the MG , they 'd have had to drop it and leave it or else stop to pick it up . Before he could fire a third time they were in among the rocks on the rim , beyond which the steep precipice fell to the river . Doll could see their backs or heads from time to time as they went on , but never long enough to shoot . The other man remained where he had fallen on the slope . So Doll had killed his first Japanese . For that matter , his first human being of any kind . Doll had hunted quite a lot , and he could remember his first deer . But this was an experience which requiredp198extra tasting . Like getting screwed the first time , it was too complex to be classed solely as pride of accomplishment . Shooting well , at anything , was always a pleasure . And Doll hated the Japanese , dirty little yellow Jap bastards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them alive if the US Army and Navy would only arrangehim a safe opportunity and supply him the ammo . But beyondthese two pleasures there was another . It had to do with guilt . Doll felt guilty . He could n't help it . He had killed a human being , a man . He had done the most horrible thing a human could do , worse than rape even . And nobody in the whole damned world could say anything to him about it . That was where the pleasure came . Nobody could do anything to him for it . He had gotten by with murder . He watched the figure on the slope . He would like to know just where he had hit him ( he had aimed for the chest ) , and whether he died right away , or if he was lying there still alive , dying slowly . Doll felt an impulse to grin a silly grin and to giggle . He felt stupid and cruel and mean and vastly superior . It certainly had helped his confidence anyway , that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a half-second and ten yards away exploded a fountain of terror and dirt , and Doll discovered his confidence had n't been helped so much after all . Before he could think he had jerked himself and his rifle down onto the floor of his little depression and curled up there , fear running like heavy threads of quicksilver through all his arteries and veins as if they were glass thermometers . After a moment he wanted to raise back up and look again but found that he could n't . What if just as he put up his head another one exploded and a piece of it took him square between the eyes , or knifed into his face , or ripped through his helmet and split his skull ? The prospect was too much . After a while , after his breathing had quieted , he again put his head up to the eye level . This time there were four Japanese preparing to leave the grassy ridge for the uphill road to Hill 210 . They came into sight from somewhere on the ridge already running . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing . Doll pulled his rifle up into position and aimed for the gun-carriers . As the party crossed the open space , he fired four times and missed each time . They disappeared into the rocks.  |p199Doll  was so furious he could have bitten a piece out of his own arm . While cursing himself , he remembered he had now fired six rounds . He released the clip and replaced it with a fresh one , sliding the two unused rounds into his pants pocket , then settled down to wait for more Japanese . Only then did he realize that what he was watching might have more implication and importance than whether he got himself another Jap . But what to do ? He remembered Big Queen had been running near him when they hit the dirt . " Hey , Queen ! " After a moment , there was a muffled answer . " Yeah ? " " Did you see them Japs leavin that left ridge ? " " I ai nt been seein much of nothin , " Queen called with muffled honesty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head up and look around ? " Doll could not resist the gibe . He suddenly felt very powerful and in command of himself , almost gay . " Go fuck yourself , Doll , " was Queen 's muffled answer . " No , Sarge , " ( he used the title deliberately ) , " I 'm serious . I counted seven Japs leavin that lefthand grassy ridge . I got me one of them , " he added modestly without , however , mentioning how many times he 'd missed . " So ? " " I think they 're pullin out of there . Maybe somebody ought to tell Bugger Stein . " " You want to be the one ? " Queen called back with muffled sarcasm . The idea had not occurred to Doll . Now it did . He had already seen the two aidmen moving about on the slope , and apparently nothing had happened to them . He could see them now , simply by turning his head a little . " Why not ? " he called cheerfully . " Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . " Suddenly his heart was beating in his throat . " You 'll do no such a goddam fucking thing , " Queen called . " You 'll stay right the fuck where you are and shut up . That 's an order . " Doll did not answer for a moment . Slowly his heart returned top200normal . He had offered and been refused . He had committed himself and been freed . But something else was driving him , something he could not put a name to . " Okay , " he called . " They 'll get us out of this in a little bit . Somebody will . You stay put . I 'm ordering you . " " I said okay , " Doll called . But the thing that was driving him , eating on him , did n't recede . He had a strange tingling all through his belly and crotch . Off to the right there was a sudden burst of the MG fire his ear now knew as Japanese , and immediately after it a cry of pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded like Stearns . No , it was n't all that easy . In spite of the two aidmen movingall around . The tingling in Doll got stronger and his heart began to pound again . He had never in his life been excited quite like this . Somebody had to get that news to Bugger . Somebody had to be a  --  hero . He had already killed one man , if you could call a Jap a man . And nobody , not a single soul in the world , could touch him for it , not a single soul . Doll raised his left eyebrow and pulled up his lip in that special grin of his . He did not wait for Big Queen , or bother with his permission . When he had squirmed himself around facing the rear , he lay a moment lifting himself to the act , his heart pounding . He could not quite bring himself to begin to move . But he knew he would . There was something else in it , also . In what it was that was driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing God . Or gambling with Luck . It was taking a dare from the Universe . It excited him more than all the hunting , gambling and fucking he had ever done all rolled together . When he went , he was up in a flash and running , not at full speed , but at about half speed which was better controlled , bent over , his rifle in both hands , even as the Japanese he himself had downed . A bullet kicked up dirt two feet to his left and he zigged right . Ten yards further on he zagged left . Then he was over the third fold into the 2d Platoon , who stared at him uncomprehendingly . Doll giggled . He found Capt Bugger Stein behind the second fold where he had just arrived , ran almost headon into him in fact and did not even have to hunt . He was hardly even winded. 1st Sgt Welsh was crouching with Stein and Band behind thep201crest of the second fold , when Doll came trotting up , bent over , giggling and laughing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had always disliked Doll for a punk , and still did , thought he looked like a young recruit coming giggling out of a whorehouse after the first real fuck of his life , and he eyed him narrowly , wanting to know why . " What the hell are you laughing at ? " Stein snapped . " At the way I fooled them yellow bastards shooting at me , " Doll gasped , giggling , but soon subsided before Stein 's gaze . Welsh , with the others , listened to his story of the seven Japaneseand two guns he had seen leaving the left ridge . " I think they 're pullin completely out of there , sir . " " Who sent you back here ? " Stein said . " Nobody , sir . I came myself . I thought it was something you 'd want to know . " " You were right . It is . " Stein nodded his head sternly . Welsh , watching him from where he crouched , wanted to spit . Bugger was acting very much the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Doll . " Doll did not answer , but he grinned . Stein , on one knee , was now rubbing his unshaven chin and blinking his eyes behind his glasses . Doll was still standing straight up . " God damn it , get down , " Stein said irritably . Doll looked around leisurely , then consented to squat , since it was obviously an order . " George , " Stein said , " get a man with glasses and have him spot the back of that ridge . I want to know the second anybody leaves it . Here , " he said , removing his own , " take mine . " " I 'll do it myself , " Band said , and bared his teeth in a brillianteyed , weird smile . He took off . Stein looked after him a long moment , and Welsh wanted to laugh . Stein turned back to Doll and began to question him about the attack , casualties , the present position and state of the platoon . Doll did n't really know very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grove was down but not whether he was dead . He had  --  they all had , he amended  --  been pretty busy when the first big bunch of mortars began to hit . He thought he had seen a group of aboutp202squad size go into the deep grass at the base of the right ridge , but was n't sure . And he had seen the machinegun squad run far out ahead and all go down together with one mortar burst . Stein cursed at this , and demanded what they were doing there in the first place . Doll of course did n't know . He thought that the center , ensconced in their U.S.-made shellholes and depressions in the bottom , were safe enough for the moment , provided the Japs did not lay a heavy mortar barrage on them . No , he himself had not been very scared the whole time . He did n't know why , really . Welsh hardly listened to them . He was looking over the crest at the 2d Platoon flattened out in a long line behind the crest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2d Platoon was as flattenedas it could get , cheeks and bellies pressed tight to the earth , faces scarred with the white of staring eyeballs and bared teeth , all looking back this way , watching for their Commander , who conceivably might order them to go over this crest again . 2d Platoonwould make a great photograph to send back home , Welsh 's eyes told him  --  without in the least disturbing his thinking  --  except that of course when the newspapers , government , army , and Life got ahold of it , it would be subtly changed to fit the needs of the moment and probably captioned : TIRED INFANTRYMEN REST INSAFETY AFTER HEROIC CAPTURE OF POSITION . THE FIRST TEAM AT HALFTIME . BUY BONDS TILL IT HURTS YOUR ASSHOLE . But all of this more or less visual thinking had nothing to do with what Welsh was thinking on another , deeper level . Mostly , he was thinking about himself . He found it satisfying to contemplate the fact that if he got it , got knocked off , the government would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew how those fuckfaces of government whitecollar workers loved their jobs and their authority . When he first enlisted , he had given a false first name and middle initial . Ile and his family had not heard from each other since . On the other hand if he only got crippled , maimed , his enemies the government would have to take care of him , since they had no next-of-kin for him . So he had the bureaucracy fucked both ways . His view of 2d Platoon misted over slightly with a vision of himself in one of those horrible Veterans Hospitals across the country , an aged man in a wheelchair , with a pint bottle of ginp203hidden in his cheap flimsy robe , cackling and quacking at the weightlifterlesbian Napoleons of nurses , at the pinheaded , pipsqueak , hard-jawed Alexander-the-greats of doctors . He 'd give them a hard time .... " You 're not really pinned down , then , " he heard Stein say . " I was told  --  " " Well , we are , in a way , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got back all right . We could n't all come back at once . " Stein nodded . " But two or three at a time could make it , I think . With 2d Platoon firing covering fire , " Doll suggested . " We do nt even know where those goddamned fucking emplacementsare , " Stein said sourly . " They could fire searching fire , could n't they ? " Doll suggested professionally . Stein glared at him . So did Welsh . Welsh wanted to boot the new hero in the ass : already giving the company commander advice  --  about searching fire , yet . Welsh interrupted them . " Hey , Cap'n ! " he growled . " You want me to go down there and get them men back up here for you ? " He glared murderously at Doll , whose eyebrows went up innocently . " No . " Stein rubbed his jaw . " No , I ca n't spare you . Might need you . Anyway , I think I 'll leave them there a while . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we can get up onto that right ridge frontally maybe they can flank it . " He paused . " What interests me is that squad on the right that got into the deep grass on the ridge . They  --  " He was interrupted by George Band who , bent over , came running down the little slope . " Hey , Jim ! Hey , Captain Stein ! I just saw five more leaving the left ridge , with two MGs . I think they really are pulling out . " " Really ? " Stein said . " Really ? " He sounded as relieved as if he had just been told the battle had been called off until another time . At least now he could act . " Gore ! Gore ! " he began to bellow . " Lt Gore ! " It required fifteen minutes to summon Gore , instruct him , assemblehis 3d Platoon , and see them off on their venture.  | " We 're pretty sure they 're pulling out completely , Gore . But do nt get overeager ; like Whyte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a trap . So go slow . Let your scouts look it over first . I think your best approach is down the draw in front of Hill 209 . Go left behind this middle fold here till it hits the draw , and then down the draw . If you get hit by mortars like they did there yesterday , you got to keep going , though . If there 's a waterhole in that brush at the foot of the ridge , let me know about it . We 're running very short of water ; already . But the main thing . The main thing , Gore , is not to lose any more men than you absolutely have to . " It was becoming an increasingly important point to Stein , almost frantically so . And whenever he was not actually occupied with something specific , that was what he brooded over . " Now , go ahead , boy ; and good luck . " Men ; men ; he was losing all his men ; men he had lived with ; men he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gore 's reserve 3d Platoon to reach its jumpoff point at the foot of the grassy ridge . He was certainlyfollowing orders and going slow , Stein thought with impatience . It was now after g:oo . In the meantime Band had come back from the crest of the fold with a report that he had counted three more small bodies of men leaving the left ridge with MGs , but had counted none in the last fifteen minutes . Also in the meantimelittle Charlie Dale the second cook had returned , his narrow closeset eyes snapping bright , and at the same time dark and thunderous . He showed Stein where he had brought the stretcher bearers to the low between the first and middle folds , four parties of four , sixteen men in all , who were already starting to collect the first of the eight litter cases which had by now accumulated . Then he asked if there were any more little jobs for him to do . Corporal Fife , lying not far from the Company Commander with the sound power phone which had more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an unholy look on a human face . Perhaps Fife was a little jealous because he was so afraid himself . Certainly there was n't any fear in Charlie Dale . His mouth hung open in a slack little grin , the bright and at the same time lowering eyes darting everywhere and filmed over with an unmistakable sheen of pleased selfsatisfaction at all this attentionp205he suddenly was getting . Fife looked at him , then sickly turned his head away and closed his eyes , his ear to the phone . This was his job ; he 'd been given it and he 'd do it ; but he 'd be damned if he 'd do anything else he was n't told to do . He could n't . He was too afraid . " Yes , " Bugger Stein was saying to Dale . " You  --  " He was interrupted by the explosion of a mortar shell amongst the 2d Platoon on the rear slope of the third fold . Its loud thwongingbang was almost simultaneous with a loud scream of pure fear , which after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . A man had thrown himself out of the line back down the slope and was bucking and kicking and rolling with both hands pressed behind him in the small of his back . When he got his breath back , he continued to scream . Everyone else hugged the comforting dirt , which nevertheless was not quite comforting enough , and waited for a barrage to begin to fall . Nothing happened , however , and after a moment they began to put their heads up to look at the kicking man who still bucked and screamed . " I do nt think they can see us any better than we can see them , " Welsh muttered , tight-lipped . " I believe that 's Private Jacques , " Lt Band said in an interested voice . The screaming had taken on a new tone , one of realization , rather than the start and surprise and pure fear of before . One of the aidmen got to him and with the help of two men from 2d Platoon tore open his shirt and got a syrette of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he was still , the aidman pulled the hands loose and rolled him over . His belt off , his shirt up , he was looked over by the aidman , who then was seen to shrug with despair and reach in his pack and begin to sprinkle . Behind the middle fold Bugger Stein was whitefaced , his lips tight , his eyes snapping open and and shut behind his glasses . This was the first of his men he had actually seen wounded . Beside him Brass Band watched the same scene with a look of friendly , sympatheticinterest on his face . Beyond Band Corporal Fife had raised up once to look while the man was still bucking and kicking andp206then lain back clown sick all over ; all he could think of was what if it had been hint ? It might easily have been , might still yet be . " Stretcher hearers ! Stretcher bearers ! " Stein had suddenly turned back toward the hollow where two of the four groups had not yet departed with loads . " Stretcher bearers ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the groups came on the run with their stretcher . " But , Jim , " Lt Band said . " Really , Jim , I do nt  --  " " God damn you , George , shut up ! Leave me alone ! " The bearers arrived out of breath . " Go get that man , " Stein said pointing over the crest to where the aidman still knelt by the casualty . The leader plainly had thought someone of the CP group here had been wounded . Now he saw his mistake . " But listen , " he protested , " we already got eight or nine down there now that we 're supposed to  --  We 're not  --  " " God damn it , do n't argue with me ! I 'm Captain Stein ! Go get that man , I said ! " Stein bawled in his face . The man recoiled , upset . Of course nobody was wearing insignia . " But , Jim , really , " Brass Band said , " he 's not  --  " " God damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around here or not ! " Stein was in a howling rage ; and he was actually almost howling . " Am I Company Commander of this outfit or am I not ! Am I Captain Stein or a goddamned private ! Do I give the orders here or do nt I ! I said go get that man ! " " Yes , sir , " the leader said . " Okay , sir . Right away . " " That man may die , " Stein said more reasonably . " He 's hit bad . Get him back to battalion aid station and see if they ca n't do something to save him . " " Yes , sir , " the leader of the bearers said . He spread his hands palms up toward Stein absolving himself of guilt . " We got others that 're hit bad , sir . ' l'hat was all I meant . We got three down there might die any minute . " Stein stared at hint uncomprehendingly . " That 's it , Jim , " Band said front behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think he ought to wait his turn ? Is n't that only fair ? " " Wait his turn ? Wait his turn ? Fair ? My God ! " Stein said . He stared at both of them , his face white.  | " Sure , " Band said . " Why put him ahead of some other guy ? " Stein did not answer him . After a moment he turned to the leader . " Go and get him , " he said stiffly , " like I told you . Get him back to battalion aid station . I gave you an order , Private . " " Yes , sir . " The leader 's voice was stony . He turned to his men . " Come on , you guys . We 're goin over there after that guy . " " Well what the hell 're we waitin for ? " one of them snarled toughly . " Come on , Hoke . Or are you afraid of gettin that close to the shooting ? " It was a ridiculous remark under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You shut up , Witt , " he said , " and let me alone . " All of them were squatting . The man he had addressed stood up suddenly . He was a small , frail-looking man , and the US helmet shell , which on Big Queen looked so small , looked like an enormous inverted pot on his small head and almost hid his eyes . He marched up to where Welsh half reclined . " Hello , Firs ' Sar n't , " the small man said with a rapacious grin . Only then did Stein , or any of the rest of the C-for-Charlie men for that matter , recognize that this Witt was their Witt , the same that Stein and Welsh had combined to transfer out before the division left for combat . All of them were astonished , as Witt obviouslymeant for them to be . Corporal Fife especially . Fife , still lying flat with the phone to his ear , sat up suddenly , grinning . " By God ! Hello , Witt ! " he cried delightedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before , passed his narrow eyes across the Corporal as if he did not exist . They came to rest on Welsh , again . " Hi , Witt , " Welsh said . " You in the medics now ? You better get down . " Stein , who had felt guilty for having transferred Witt when he knew how badly Witt wanted to stay , even though he still felt he had done what was best for his company , said nothing . Witt ignored Welsh 's cautioning . He remained standing straight up . " Naw , Firs ' Sar n't , " he grinned . " Still in Cannon Comp'ny . Only , as you know , we ai nt got no cannons . So they 've put us to work pushin boats up and down the river and as stretcher bearers . " He inclined his head . " Who we goin after over there , Firs ' Sar n't ? "  | " Jacques , " Welsh said . " Old Jockey ? " Witt said . " Shit , that 's too bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now running downhill beyond the crest of the fold and Witt turned to follow them . But then he turned back and spoke directly to Bugger Stein . " Please , sir , can I come back to the compny ? After we get Jockey back to battalion ? I can slip away easy . They 'll give Hoke another man . Can I , sir ? " Stein was flattered . He was also confused . This whole thing of the stretcher bearers and Jacques was getting out of hand , taking too much of his attention from the plan he had been just about to conceive . " Well , I  --  " he said and stopped , his mind blank . " Of course , you 'll have to get someone 's permission . " Witt grinned cynically . " Sure , " he said . " And my rifle . Thank you , sir . " He turned and was gone , after his mates . Stein tried to reorganize the scattered threads of his thought . For a moment he stared after Witt . For a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of an attack was simply incomprehensible to him . In a way , though , it was very romantic . Like something out of Kipling . Or Beau Geste . Now , what was it that he had just about had figured out ? Close to Stein , as Bugger 's orders about the phone demanded he be , Corporal Fife had lain back down flat with his phone and shut his eyes . Even though he knew that Witt 's gesture of ignoring him had to do with their argument of a few days back , he could not help taking it as contempt and disgust for his present cowardice  --  as if Witt with one glance had looked inside his mind . When he reopenedhis eyes , he found himself looking into the white face of little Bead a few feet away , eyes popeyed with fright , blinking almostaudibly , like some overgrown rabbit . " Dale ! " Bugger called . " Now , look , " he said , marshaling his mind . Charlie Dale crawled closer . When he first returned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , but when the mortar shell exploded wounding Jacques , he had flattened himself . Now he compromised by squatting . Bugger had been just about to tell him something , perhaps send him on another mission , when Jacques got hit and then the stretcher bearers came . Dale could not help feeling a little piqued . Not at Jacques of course . He couldn'tp209be mad at Jockey really . But he might have picked himself a better time to get shot up . But those goddam stretcher bearers from CannonCompny and that goddam bolshevik Witt , they certainly could have taken less of the Compny Cmander 's valuable time . Especially when he was about to tell Pfc Dale something very important maybe . For Dale this was the first chance that he had had in a long time for talking to the Compny Cmander personally like this , for being free of that goddam order-giving Storm and his cheating cooks , first chance to not be tied to that goddam greasy sweating kitchen cooking masses of food for a bunch of men to gorge their guts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting more personal attentionthan he had ever had from this outfit , at last they were beginning to recognize him , and all he had to do for it was carry a few messages through some light MG fire that could n't hit him anyway . Gravy . Not far off he could see fucking Storm lying all flattened out beside Sgt Welsh , and looking this way . Squatting , Dale put a respectful expression on his face and listened to his commander intently . An inarticulate , secret excitement burgeoned in him . " I 've got to know how 3d Platoon is doing , " Bugger was telling him . " I want you to go and find out for me . " He described the position and told him how to get there . " Report to Lt Gore if you can find him . But I 've got to know if they occupied that grassy ridge , and I 've got to know as soon as possible . Get back as soon as you can . " " Aye , aye , sir , " Dale said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Doll to stay with me , " Bugger said . " I 'll have further work for both of you . You 've both been invaluable . " " Yes , sir , " Dale smiled . Then , unsmiling , he looked over at Doll , and found Doll to be studying him equally . " Now , go ! " " Right , sir . " He snapped out a tiny little salute and took off , running bent over along the low area behind the fold , his rifle slung across his back , his Thompsongun in his hands . He did not have to go far . At the corner where the hollow met the draw in front of Hill 209 , he met a man from 3d Platoon already on his way back with the news that 3d Platoon had occupied the lefthandp210grassy ridge without firing a shot and were now digging themselves in there . Together they returned to Stein , Dale feeling a little cheated . Stein had not waited for Dale 's return . Gradually his plan had shaped itself in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether 3d Platoon had occupied the lefthand ridge made little difference to it . They could provide more covering fire , and that would help , but it was not essential , because this movement had to do with the squad-size group of 1st Platoon men who had made it in under the machineguns , into the thicker grass at the foot of the righthand ridge . That righthand ridge was obviously going to be the trouble spot , the stumbling block . With the squad-sized group already there plus two more squads from 2d Platoon Stein wanted to make a sort of double-winged uphill frontal attack whose center would hold and whose ends would curl around and isolate the main strongpoint on the ridge , wherever it was . The remainder of 2d Platoon could fire cover from the third fold , and Stein thought the rest of 1st Platoon -- the remnants , he amended sourly  --  could fire cover along the flank from their advanced position in their holes . With this in mind he had already , after Charlie Dale 's departure , sent Doll back down into that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where 1st Platoon still dung precariouslyto the dirt of their holes , sweating . Doll had only just left when the stretcher bearers came back with Jacques . Stein found he could not resist the desire to look at him . Neither could anybody else . They had laid him on his stomach on the stretcher . The aidman had a gauze compress over the wound , but it was apparent that there was a long glancing hole in the small of Jacques 's back . His face hung over the side of the stretcher , and his half-closed eyes , dulled of intelligence by the morphine and by shock , held only a peculiar questioning look . He appeared to be asking them , or somebody , why ?  --  why he , John Jacques , ASN so-and-so , had been chosen for this particular fate ? Somewhere a stranger had dropped a metal case down a tube , not knowing exactly where it would land , not even sure where he wanted it to land . It had gone up and come down . And where did it land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had burst , thousands of chunks and pieces of knife-edgedp211metal had gone chirring in all directions . And who was the only one touched by one of them ? John Jacques , ASN so-and-so . Why ? Why him ? No enemy had aimed anything at John Jacques , ASN so-and-so . No enemy knew that John Jacques , ASN so-and-so , existed . Any more than he knew the name , character and personality of the Japanese who dropped the metal case down the tube . So why ? Why him ? Why John Jacques , ASN so-and-so ? Why not somebody else ? Why not one of his friends ? And now it was done . Soon he would be dead . Stein forced himself to look somewhere else . At the tail , off end of the stretcher he saw Witt , who , being shorter , had to strain more to keep his end up level . Thinking about Doll and ist Platoon , Stein was just about to send someone after Sgt. Keck , the new commander of 2d Platoon , when Charlie Dale and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not intended , when he first came back , to set himself up as a troubleshooting messenger to dangerous areas for Bugger Stein . Truthfully , he did not really know why he had done it . And now he was hooked . Also , he was angered at the easiness of Charlie Dale 's mission when compared to the hardness of his own . Any damn fool could go back , after stretcher bearers , or even forward when he had a covered route all the way . For himself , he did not know how he was going to accomplishhis job . Whyte was dead , Grove dead or badly wounded , and that left the command of the platoon to Skinny Culn , the platoon guide . If he was not hit or dead too . Sgt Culn was a round , redfaced , pugnosed , jovial Irishman of 28 , an old regular who ought to be all right leading the platoon . But Doll had no idea where to find him . The only man whose whereabouts Doll knew was Big Queen . This meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hole to hole , looking , and down there Doll did not relish that idea . He 'd like to see Dale do it . Before going , he lay behind the crest of the third fold amongst the 2d Platoon and raised his head to look down into the low area where he must go . The 2d Platoon men nearby , cheeks pressed to the earth , stared at him with indifferent , sullen curiosity . He was aware that his eyes were narrowed , his nostrils flared , his jaw set.  |p212He  made a handsome picture of a soldier for the 2d Platoon men who watched him without liking . Out in front one of the medics was helping back a fat man who had been shot through the calf and was groaning audibly . Doll felt a sort of amused contempt for him ; why could n't he keep his mouth shut ? Once again the sick excitementhad taken hold of him and gripped him by the belly , making his crotch tingle and his heart pound and paralyzing his diaphragm so that he breathed slower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until his essence and being ran down and seemed to stop in an entranced totality of concentration . Then he was up and running . He ran bent over and at half speed and exposed to the world , the same way he had run up out of there . Some bullets kicked up dirt to right and left . He zigged and zagged . In ten seconds ' time he was back down flat in his little depression already calling breathlessly for Queen and wanting to laugh out loud . He had known all along he 'd make it . A burst of MG fire tickled the rim of his hole and whined away , showering him with dirt . But the getting here was only the beginning . He still had to find Culn . And the muffled information which came to him from Big Queen down in his hole was that Culn was somewhere over on the right ; at least Queen had seen him there before the charge . But when Doll rolled over and called off to his right , the man who should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A great soft lump of fear had risen in Doll 's throat as he talked . He tried now to swallow it , but it remained . This was the situation he had been dreading back at the third fold before taking off . He was going to have to run down the line of holes looking for Culn . All right then goddam them . He would show them . He 'd do it , do it standing on his head . And then let 's see what that little punk Dale could do . He was Don Doll and nobody was going to kill him in this war . The sons of bitches . Once again that great , strange stillness which he got , and which affected his breathing , came over Doll , blanketing out everything , as he prepared to get up . In his pants his balls tingled acutely . It was exactly the same feeling he used to get as a kid when something like Christmas got him excited . Let 's see their faces and Bugger Stein 's when he came back out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten about his messengerto the 1st Platoon . The stress of newer developments claimed him . With the return of Charlie Dale and the good news about 3d Platoon , he decided not to send for Keck but to go to him . There , behind the third fold with 2d Platoon , he could both mount the attack he planned and observe it . With this in mind he had sent George Band with Sgt Storm and the cook force back around the covered route to join 3d Platoon . Band was to assume command and be prepared to attack the righthand ridge if Stein 's attack succeeded . Band , with his weird bloodthirsty grin , constant neat advice and cool calm interest in the wounded , had been getting on Stein 's nerves more and more , and this was a good way to get rid of him and at the same time make him useful . Then he put in a call to Col Tall , Battalion Commander . More and more things had been getting on Stein 's nerves , more and more increasingly . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did was right , might n't have been done better and with less cost in some other way . He felt that way about the attack he was preparing to mount now . In addition there was his own nervous fear and apprehension , which kept eating into his energy more and more . Danger flickered and blinked in the air like a faulty neon tube . Whenever he stood up he might be struck by a bullet . Wheneverhe moved a few feet he might be moving under a descending mortar shell . Hiding these apprehensions from his men was even more fatiguing . Also , he had already finished off one of his two canteens of water , and was a third through the other , without ever having allayed his thirst . And in addition to all of this that was wearing him down there was something else coming increasingly to attention , and that was inertia . His men would do what he told them to if he told them explicitly and specifically . Otherwise they would simply lie with their cheeks pressed to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Dale ; and Doll . Initiative may have been the descriptive word for the Civil War ; or enthusiasm . But apparently inertia was the one for this one . Stein had already talked to Tall about the Japanese evacuation of the lefthand grassy ridge , and had informed him that it was being occupied by C-for-Charlie 's 3d Platoon ; so he was dumbfoundedp214when the Colonel began to shout at him over the sound power phone that he was too far to the right . He was not even given an opportunity to explain his proposed attack . The sound power phone was a weal invention for explanations and one-sided conversations , because the listening party could not speak until the other turned it over and released the button ; but somehow Tall seemed able to make this work for him , while Stein could not do the same. " lii-t I do nt understand . What do you mean too far to the right ? I told you they 've evacuated the lefthand grassy ridge . And my 3d Platoon 's occupied it . How can I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the right across our front . Over . " " God damn it , Stein ! " the Col 's cold thin angry voice cried . " 1'n- telling you your left flank 's exposed . " Because of the phone Stein could not protest that it was n't , and the Col went on with rhetoric . " Do you know what it is to expose your left flank ? Did you ever read in a tactics manual about exposing your left flank ? Your left flank is exposed . And damn it , you 've got to move down there . You 're not moving ! Over ! " The moment for protesting was past , lost while Tall 's thumb depressed the button . Stein could only defend , harrassed fury burning in him . " But God damn it , Colonel , that 's why I called you ! I 'm trying to ! I 'm preparing to attack the righthand grassy ridge right now . " He stopped , forgetting to say over ' , and there was a long silence . " Over , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stein , I told you you 're too far right already , " the Col 's voice came from the faroff areas of safety . " You 're sideslipping to the right alla time . Over . " " Well , what do you want me to do ? You want me to withdraw the rest of my company to the lefthand grassy ridge , too ? Over . " That , lie knew , would be insane . " No . I 've decided to commit the reserve company on your left  --  with orders to attack . Orders to attack , Stein , you hear ? orders to attack . You stay where you are . I 'll have Baker Company 's commandersend your reserve platoon back to you . Over . " " Do you want me to go ahead with my attack ? " Stein asked , because it was n't plain from what he 'd heard . " Over . " " What else ? " the Col 's thin , outraged voice piped at him.  | " What else , Stein ? You 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , get cracking ! " There was a pause and Stein could hear electrical whinings and what sounded like polite mumblings . He heard one distinct , respectful " Yes , sir " in Tall 's voice . Then the Colonel 's voice came back on again , much kinder now , more jovial . " Get cracking , boy ! Get cracking ! " Tall said heartily . " Over and out . " Stein came back to himself to find himself looking into the wide , nervous eyes of Fife . He handed him the phone . Well , that was that . He had not even got to explain his attack plan , and he would have liked to because once again he could not be sure that he was right . But the big brass had arrived at the phone station , obviously . There was no point in trying to call back while Tall had those people clustered around him . Yes , the big brass . The observers . Today they even had an Admiral . Stein had a sudden and unholy , heartfreezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of an identical recurrence up there now of the scene he himself had witnessed on Hill 207 two days ago . The same harrassed , apprehensive Battalion Colonel with field glasses ; the same diffident , but equally apprehensive little knot of eagles and stars peering over his spiritual shoulder ; the same massed mob of pawns and minor pieces craning to see like a stadium crowd ; all were up there right now , going through the identical gyrations their identical counterparts had gone through two days ago . While down below were the same blood-sweating Captains and their troops going through theirs . Only this time he himself , he Jim Stein , was one of them , one of the committed ones . The committed ones going through their exaggerated pretensesof invoking the cool calm logic and laws of the science of tactics . And tomorrow it would be someone else . It was a horrifying vision : all of them doing the same identical thing , all of them powerless to stop it , all of them devoutly and proudly believing themselves to be free individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the millions of men , doing the same on thousands of hilltops across the world . And it did n't stop there . It went on . It was the concept  --  concept ? the fact ; the reality  --  of the modern State in action . It was so horrible a picture that Stein could notp216support or accept it . He put it away from him , and blinked his bulging eyes . What he had to do right now was get his Company Hq over behind the third fold with Keck and the 2d Platoon . From the top of the third fold there was really very little to see . Stein and his sergeants lay behind the crest and looked as they talked . In front of them perhaps a hundred yards away the waiting grassy ridge rose , apparently devoid of life . Behind it at some distancethe upper reaches of The Elephant 's Head , their real objective , rose still higher . The stony open ground , thinly grassed , fell gently in a rolling motion for fifty yards , then leveled out . Tactically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crest ) had served no good purpose at all with his charge , Stein saw immediately . Whyte 's platoon , situated further to the left where the white eyeballs and sweating faces of 2d Platoon now lay watching Stein , had rolled forward in a long wave not directed at either ridge but with its ends lapping against both , while the main strength bulged out into the open center which served only to funnel the fire from both ridges and the Hill itself . It could n't have been handled worse . But that was that . This was this . Stein 's problem now as he saw it , his first problem anyway , was the getting of his men from the comparative safety of here down that fucking outrageous bareass slope to the comparative safety of the foot of the ridge , where they would be defiladed from the MGs and protected from the mortars by their closeness to the Japanese . Once they were there  --  But gettingthem thereStein had already decided to use only two squads of his 2d Platoon , augmented by the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enough , and he had not got to discuss it with Col Tall , but he did not want to commit more men until he had some idea of what was against him . He had also decided how to choose the two squads . In fact , he had given more thought to this than to the other . He was obsessed by a feeling of moral culpability about choosing which men to send in . Some of them would surely die , and he did not want to choose which ones . Rather than do that he decided simply to take arbitrarily the first two squads on the right of the line ( they were the closest ) , and thus let Luck or Chancep217or Fate or whatever agency ran the lives of men do the choosing . That way no agent of retribution could hold him responsible . Lying on the slope , he told Keck which ones he wanted . Keck , who certainly would know , who always knew just where his men were , nodded and said that that would be McCron 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stein nodded back , feeling sorry for them . McCron the motherhen , and Milly Beck the martinet . John Bell was in McCron 's squad . But before he could do anything with his two squads he must , Stein felt , know more about the men already down there . They were already there , and would n't have to run the gauntlet , but what sort of shape were they in ? Were any of them wounded ? Did they have a noncom with them ? Was their morale unbroken ? Stein felt he had to know , and the only way to find out was to send somebody . He sent Charlie Dale . It was an extraordinary performance . The little man licked his lips in their mean , dull grin , hitched up his rifle and Thompsongun , and nodded his head . He was ready to go . Stein , who had never liked him , and did n't like him now , watched him go with a growing admiration which only increased his dislike . He went dogtrottingand unblinking ( the thick set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in a straight line down the open slope toward the grassy ridge . He ran bent over at the waist in that peculiar fashion everybody instinctively adopted , but he did not zig or zag . Nothing touched him . Arriving , he dived into the thicker grass and disappeared . Three minutes later he reappeared , and came dogtrotting and unblinking back . Stein could not help wondering what he thought about , but would not ask . Charlie Dale would have been pleased to have been asked . But he really did not think much of anything . He had been told that all Japs had bad eyes and wore glasses and were poor marksmen , anyway . He knew nothing could hit him . Going down , he concentratedhis eyes and all his attention on the foot of the ridge . Coming back , he concentrated on a spot at the crest of the fold . The only thing he really thought about or felt was a querulous irritation that Storm and the other cooks had been sent off to the 3d Platoon and so were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after he hadp218completed one or two more of these things , he ought to be able to move into a rifle platoon as at least a corporal or perhaps even as a sergeant , and in this way get out of the kitchen without having to become a private . This had been his secret plan from the beginning . And he had noted that casualties among the noncoms were already pretty heavy . Dale at lived back at the third fold a hero . In its way it was quite a feat , what he had done . Even from the crest of the fold it was possible to see the amount of MG and rifle fire which had been hitting the ground all around him . Everybody who had not wanted to go , and would not have gone , was pleased with him ; and Dale was pleased with himself . Everyone within reach slapped him on the back as he made his way to Stein to make his report , which was that they were all okay down there , that their morale was unimpaired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were all privates . " All right , " Stein said , still lying beside Keck on the reverse slope . " Now , listen . They have n't got a noncom with them , and I ca n't send anybody here away from his own squad . If you want to go back down there with the others when they go , I 'll make you an acting sergeant right now , and you 'll be in command of that extra squad . Do you want to do that ? " " Sure , " Dale said at once . He made his mean grin and licked his lips . " Sure , sir . " He bobbed his head on his perpetually hunched shoulders , and his expression changed to one of patently false 1-u-i-ility . " If you think I 'm capable , sir . If you think I can do it . " Stein looked at him with distaste , not very well concealed . But it was concealed enough for Charlie Dale 's acumen .  --  Or was it ? " Okay , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll go down with the others . " " Aye , sir , " Dale said . " But do nt you have to say hereby ? " " What ? " " 1 said : I ) ont you have to say hereby ? You know , to make it official . " In some slow-stirring , labyrinthine depth of his animal 's mind Dale seemed to be suspicious of Stein 's honesty . " No . I do nt have to say hereby . Hereby what ? I do nt have top219say anything but what I 've said . You 're an acting sergeant . You 'll go down with the others . " " Aye , sir , " Dale said and crawled away . Stein and Keck exchanged a glance . " I think I better go down , too , Cap'n , " Keck said . " Somebody should be in charge down there . " Stein nodded , slowly . " I guess you 're right . But take care of yourself . I need you . " " I 'll take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Keck 's humorless answer . Around them the tension over the attack was beginning to mount and be felt . It showed plainly on the faces of 2d Platoon , white-eyed and sweating , and all turned toward the little group of leaders like a row of sunflowers turned toward the sun . On the left the first elements of the 3d Platoon had reappeared in the low between the second and third folds and were making their way toward Stein running bent over at the waist , the others following strung out behind them . Over the top of the second fold behind him another , lone figure came hurrying toward Stein , also running bent over at the waist . It was Witt returning , this time with his rifle and some extra bandoliers . Everything seemed to be concentrating . The moment of truth , Stein thought and looked at his watch , which said 12:02 . Moment of truth , shit . My God , could it have been that long ? It seemed like only seconds . And yet it seemed like years , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or his fate for him  --  chose to return from his hazardous mission to 1st Platoon . Doll came running up the slight slope at about the middle of the 2d Platoon , dove over the crest and fell , then scrambled along the reverse slope to where Stein was , to report . He had found Sgt Culn . But arriving at the knot of leaders he collapsed , sobbing for breath for almost a minute . There was no giggling this time , and no arch display of insouciance . His face was drawn and strained , the lines beside his open mouth deeply etched . He had run along the uneven line of holes calling for Skinny Culn , with fire being put down all around him . Men had looked up at him from their holes with startled disbelief on their faces . His body , abetted by his imagination , had quickly reached the point where it was threaten/ing to disobey him . Finally three holes in front of him a hand and arm had shot into the air , the hand describing the old circular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find Culn lying placidly on his side and grinning up at him ruefully , his rifle hugged against his chest . " Come right in , " Culn said ; but Doll had already dived . The hole was n't big enough for two men . They had huddled together in it while Doll brought Culn up to ( late on the casualties , told him Stein 's plan , told him 1st Platoon 's part in it . Culn had scratched his reddish stubble . " So I got the platoon . Well , well . Okay , tell him I 'll try . But you tell Bugger we 're sort of de-morale-ized down here , as it says in the field manuals . But I 'll do the best I can . " Seconds later Doll had been back behind the third fold in what seemed to him to be enormous safety , and then reporting to Stein . He made his report proudly . Doll did not know what kind of reception he had expected from them , but it was not the one that he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a tougher mission , and with much less display of nerves . 3d Platoon was in the act of arriving , and had to be taken care of by Stein . And the mounting tension of the coming attack made everybody rather preoccupied , anyway . Buggerlistened to his report and nodded , gave him a pat on the arm as one might toss a fish to a trained seal after its act , and dismissed him . Doll had no choice but to crawl away , his bravery and heroism ignored and unappreciated . Wondering that he was still alive , he ached to tell somebody how narrowly he had escaped death . And then , as he sat down and looked up , there adding salt to his wounds was Charlie Dale , sitting nearby and grinning a rapaciously superior grin at him . While he sat and stared back at him , Doll was forced to listen to little Private Bead , lying beside him , recount the tale of Dale 's exploit . Nor was Dale all . Witt , the mad volunteer , the crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company under fire , had been crouching behind Doll all during Doll 's report , waitinghis own turn at Stein . Now he reported too and when Stein briefly explained the impending attack to him , he immediately asked permission to go along . Stein , unable to hide his stunned disbeliefentirely , nodded his agreement and sent Witt over to Millyp221Beck 's squad . It was this final straw , this blow in the face by Fate , added to the knowledge that Charlie Dale was going  --  and as an acting sergeant yet , which made Doll open his mouth and speak up . As much a reflex as the yell of a man pricked with a knife , Doll heard his voice . With horror he listened to himself asking , in a clear , bell-like , resolute , confident tone , if he could not go along himself . When Stein said yes and sent him to McCron 's squad , he crawled away biting the inside of his lip so hard that it brought tears to his eyes . He was wishing he could do worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; bite a whole chunk out of his arm . Why did he do things like this to himself ? Why did he ? There was nothing to keep them now . Everything was arranged . They could get on with it any time . Stein and Keck lay side by side behind the little crest , with 1st Sgt Welsh lying beside them in a flat-faced , uncommunicative silence , and looked it over one more time . Stein had placed 3d Platoon about thirty yards behind and below them on the slope , in two echelons of two squads each ; they were to be ready to attack and exploit any advantage which arose . He had sent word back to his mortar section to raise their fire further up the ridge . He had his one remaining machine gun placed behind the crest of the third fold . Off to the left on the lefthandgrassy ridge a lot of fire was being put forth but Stein did not see any of B-for-Baker moving . As he watched , two Japanese mortar rounds landed and went up , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think we better send them down in bunches of three or four , at irregular intervals , " he said turning his head to Keck . " When they 're all there , space them out . Advance them by rushes , or in a line . Use your own judgment .  --  I guess you might as well go . " " I 'll take the first bunch down myself , " Keck said huskily , staring down the slope . " Listen , Cap'n , " he said , looking at Stein , and at Brass Band who had just come up , " there 's somethin I wanted to tell you . That guy Bell is a good man . He 's pretty steady . He helped me get going and get the platoon out of that hole we were in after that charge . " He paused . " I just wanted to tell you . " " Okay . I 'll remember . " Stein felt an unnamable , **26;3478;TOOLONG that he could not do anything about . It forced him to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawl off . " Give them hell , Sergeant ! " George Band said cheerily . " Give them hell ! " Keck paused in his crawl long enough to look back . " Yeh , " he said . The two squads , with their three extra men , had more or less separated themselves from the other half of the platoon . The most of them , in their bodily attitudes and in their faces , resembled sheep about to be led to the slaughter pens in Chicago . They waited . Keck had only to crawl to them and instruct them . " Okay , you guys . This is it . We 're goin down in groups of four . No point in goin by rushes , only make a better target stopped . So run all the way . We ai nt got any choice . We 're picked , and so we got to go . I 'll take the first bunch myself to show you how easy it is . I want Charlie Dale with me . Dale ? So you can organize them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He started the crawl to the jumpoff point just beyond the knot of officers and CP men , and it was here that the first case of overt cowardice ( if it could be called that , and if S/Sgt Stack could be omitted ) occurred in C-for-Charlie . A big , beautifully muscled man named Sico , an Italian draftee from Philly with some five months service , suddenly sat down in his tracks and began to hold his stomach and groan . It blocked the line behind him and when somebodycalled , the ones in front stopped also . Keck crawled back to him . His squad sergeant , Beck the martinet , crawled over to him too . Beck was very young for a martinet , but he was a very good one . The rifles of his squad had been the most perfect at inspections since he came into the company with six years service and immediately got promoted . Withal , he still was not really mean , only stern . He was not very bright at anything else or even interested , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed that anything like this could happen to any man in his squad , and because of this , furious . " Get up , God damn you , Sico , " he said in his stern , command voice . " Or I 'll kick you so hard in that stomach you 'll really be sick . "  | " I ca n't , Sergeant , " Sico said . His face was drawn up grotesquely . And his eyes were puddles of terror , bottomless , anguished , and a little guilty . " I would if I could . You know I would . I 'm sick . " " Sick , my foot , " said Beck , who never swore much , and for whom the phrase God damn you was inordinately strong . " Hold it , Beck , " Keck said . " What is it , Sico ? " " I do nt know , Sergeant . It 's my stomach . Pains . And cramps . I ca n't straighten up . I 'm sick , " he said , looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . " I 'm sick , " he said again , and as if to prove it suddenly vomited . He did not even try to bend over and the vomit burped up out of him and ran down over his fatigue shirt onto his hands which held his belly . He looked at Keck hopefully , but appeared ready to do it again if necessary . Keck studied him a moment . " Leave him , " he said to Beck . " Come on .  --  The medics will take care of you , Sico , " he said to Sico . " Thank you , Sergeant , " Sico said . " But  --  " Beck began . " Do nt argue with me , " Keck said , already crawling away . " Right , " Beck said , and followed . Sico continued to sit and watched the others pass . The medics did indeed take care of him . One of them , the junior , though he looked much like his shyfaced , bespectacled senior , came and led him back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands holding his stomach . He groaned audibly from time to time and now and then he gagged , but apparently did not feel it necessary to vomit more . His face was haunted-looking and his eyes tormented . But clearly nobody would ever convince him he had not been sick . Whenever he looked at the C-for-Charlie men he passed , it was appealingly , a certain unspoken request for understanding , for belief . As for the others , they looked back noncommittally . None of their faces held contempt . Instead , under the white-eyed sweating pucker of fear , there was a hint of sheepish envy , as if they would have liked to do the same but were afraid they could not bring it off . Sico , who could undoubtedly read this look , apparently got no comfort from it . He tottered on , helped by the junior medic , and the last that C-for-Charlie ever saw of him was when he hobbled out of sight beyond the second fold.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
