THE PRESIDENCY <P> When Lyndon Baines Johnson enters the voting booth this week at the Pedernales Electric Co-Op in Johnson City , his name , for a change , will not be on the ballot . After 31 years in Washington and ten consecutive election victories , L.B.J. will be coming home . His fellow-Texans in Johnson City will be pleased to have him back . <P> They should be . During Lyndon Johnson 's three decades in Washington , the community has been transformed from a decaying , unpaved cow town into a humming tourist mecca . As Congressman , Senator , Vice President and President , Johnson City 's native son has showered largesse on his home hill country . First , in New Deal days , came the Lower Colorado River Authority , whose dams harnessed and tamed waters that had ravaged the countryside . Then he won for Johnson City the Pedernales Co-Op , which today provides power from the authority 's steam plants to some 18,500 customers in seven counties . Lately there has been more : a handsome 50-unit $650,000 housing development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant for a badly needed 30-bed hospital , and a small , as yet unannounced federal building that will house the post office and local federal agencies . <P> House of Parlors . Johnson City ( pop . 854 ) has also helped itself . A new dam on the Pedernales , with storage tanks that have raised the town 's water reserves to a quarter-million gallons , was assisted by a federal matching grant after Johnson Citians had voted a $217,000 revenue bond issue to finance their half . Still , Lyndon Johnson gets the credit for most improvements : there is a Lake Lyndon B. Johnson in nearby Kingsland , a Lyndon B. Johnson High School , a Lyndon Baines Johnson State Park , and several roads bearing the presidential name . In the Texas state capital of Austin-an hour 's drive from Johnson City-there will be the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library at the University of Texas . About the only local institution that does not commemorate L.B.J. is Johnson City itself , which was named for his pioneer forebears . <P> The biggest magnet for visitors is L.B.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Historical Landmark , which after three years of operation greeted its 200,000th visitor last summer . The modest white frame house is something more than " restored . " All the rooms are furnished as parlors , stuffed with turn-of-the-century furniture and L.B.J. memorabilia . More rustic , but open to the public only when the President is away , is a rebuilt " birthplace " cabin on the edge of the ranch itself .
