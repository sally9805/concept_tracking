A ragtag collection of the unshaven and unscrubbed - they could be called Vietniks - turned out last weekend to promote the most popular new anti-cause . Celebrating two grandly styled International Days of Protest , a nationwide series of demonstrations against U.S. policy in Viet Nam , they battered eardrums on campuses and street corners , but found in many cases that they were outnumbered and outshouted by supporters of their nation 's foreign policy . <P> The organization nominally behind the demonstrations is the National Coordinating Committee to End the War in Viet Nam . A two-month-old shoe string operation headquartered near the University of Wisconsin at Madison , it produces a newsletter and claims a steering committee of 45 members who represent local end-the-war groups . The chairman , at $25 a week , is Frank Emspak , 22 , who obtained his zoology degree at Wisconsin this year . His deputy is Ray Robinson Jr. , 31 , a bearded former prizefighter and civil rights worker who got an undesirable discharge from the Navy . Explains Robin son : " They said I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the whole , the Vietnik rallies - which also attracted some tweedy faculty members and clean-cut non-beats - seemed to bear out a Senate Internal Security Subcommittee report issued last week . While most members of the protest movement are loyal Americans , it said , control of the movement has " clearly passed " into the hands of Communists and extremist elements who are openly sympathetic to the Viet Cong . " <P> Most of the demonstrators ' arguments should certainly comfort Peking and Hanoi . At Detroit 's Wayne University , Al Harrison , a young Negro " organizer , " cried : " You all got me and my kind in chains ! We got no business fighting a yellow man 's war to save the white man . " Wayne History Professor Norman Pollack-predictably , his specialty is the 19th century-argued that " pockets of profits " kept the U.S. in the war . " If there were no Viet Nam , " said he , " the American Government would have to invent one . " <P> Slug for Slap . On some campuses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the opposition sang The Star-Spangled Banner over and over , all but drowning out the Vietniks . In Chicago and Oakland , Calif. , demonstrators were pelted with raw eggs , and cops broke up a few mild scuffles . The leading rank of 10,000 paraders in New York City got doused with red paint . Even pleaders for peace can become aggressive . At New Jersey 's Rutgers University , a hotbed of anti-Viet Nam sentiment ( see preceding story ) , a middle-aged woman lightly slapped Biology Senior Alan Marain for abusing U.S. troops in Viet Nam , where her son is serving . So Marain , 21 , slugged her in the face . <P> Most of the demonstrations were orderly . The biggest , nearly 12,000 strong , started from the University of California 's Berkeley campus , aimed to march 7 miles to the Army Terminal in Oakland , but lacked a parade permit ; police turned them back without incident after the first miles . Later , someone tossed a tear-gas bomb at the marchers in a Berkeley park .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
