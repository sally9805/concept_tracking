txt The withdrawal here of a little " blue book " is perhaps the first sign that an 18-month-old acrimonious feud between Balkan neighbors Bulgaria and Yugoslavia may be cooling off . The " blue book " was published near the end of last year by the historical section of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences . Its subject : , the Macedonian question  --  for nearly a century a flashpoint in that old cockpit of Europe , as the Balkans used to be regarded . Old quarrels fanned Scholars  --  French , British , and others besides Bulgarians and Serbs  --  have written innumerable , learned books about it . Belgrade and Sofia were always ready to fight over it and sometimes did . They are not likely to do so today  --  though all last year pens bristling with invective were freely used on both sides . And in the anxiety and tension which gripped . Europe after the invasion of Czecho- Slovakia , Bulgaria 's " blue book " hotted up the battle of words to a pitch where , for a time , resort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Macedonia were often fanned by the rival big European powers . The latter-day dispute is between two Communist states which have blown hot and cold in their relations ever since one of them , Yugoslavia , was expelled from Stalin 's Cominform in 1948 . Recognition refused The issue boils down to an argument over the historic existence of an independent Macedonian state having its own language and culture . The Yugoslays believe in it . In Yugoslavia 's Macedonian republic , 80 percent of its population is Macedonian and speaks a different language from Serbs , Croats , and other members of the federation . The Bulgarians , however , maintain that the Macedonians  --  partitioned and scattered over Greece , Serbia , and Bulgaria in 1912 ? never had a separate national state existence but represented only a geographical region ' , similar to other parts of the Balkan peninsula . They refuse to recognize a Macedonian language . They insist that Yugoslavia 's Macedonians are really Bulgarians ; that there is no essential difference between their language and that of the Bulgarian-speaking population in Bulgaria 's Macedonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar attitude over the Macedonians in . northern Greece after the last war . But mostly these " Slovo phones , " as the Greeks called them , have been dispersed and are no more an issue . Belgrade and Sofia alike call freely on history and accuse each other of twisting it to clinch their case . This last prolonged dispute began wheif // * Sofia-Belgrade feud over Macedonia cools // Bulgarian historians marked the 90th anniversary of a treaty which briefly envisaged a Bulgaria reaching westward as far as Albania . The treaty was , in fact , speedily annulled by the big powers of the day . But the Yugo-slays chose to see its recall as evidence that old territorial dreams lingered in Bulgarian minds . New split heats - Belgrade 's new split with Moscow over Czechoslovakia raised the temperature of the polemics still further . Then came the " blue book . " It was a massive compendium of history . It also had a highly political introduction and conclusion which riled the Yugoslays as much as the history . In 1965 and again two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had agreed that Macedonia should be left to the historians ; that they would concentrate instead on the development of Balkan cooperation . All that was now forgotten . Radio polemics crackled over the border , press attacks escalated , and relations reached rock bottom , culminating in February and March in an exchange of official protests . Since these notes , however , there has been a lull . One explanation offered is that the Soviets advised the Bulgarians to abate the quarrel . Such a theory fits in with the proposals for European cooperation embodied in the Warsaw Pact 's recent call for an all-European security conference . In any event , a search at bookshops here for the Bulgarian " blue book " elicited the reply that remaining copies had been recalled . A senior official scoffed at suspicions that Bulgaria ? had territorial ambitions or dreams . We would not be so naive , he said . We want only to preserve our own history . He said also that Bulgaria recognized Yugoslav Macedonia and was ready for talks with the Belgrade government in order to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the moment both sides insist on their own goodwill but also contend that the other 's note merely upheld old attitudes and offered nothing conducive to an atmosphere suitable for negotiations . But it seemed to this writer in conversations , in Belgrade and here , that both sides now are anxious to seek a new agreement . Promising turn seen Only a few yeari ago Balkan cooperation had taken a promising turn . Bulgaria improved its relations not only with Yugoslavia but also with Greece and Turkey .. There now is a new cultural freeze between here and Athens  --  a result of the Greek military coup . But the various agreements between the two governments on economic cooperation still are being pursued effectively . Romania 's leader Nicolae Ceausescu has been visiting Turkey , with whom the Bulgarians also are on better terms now than at any time since the war . Bulgarians and Yugoslays regard themselves as the essential faCtors to harmony over the whole area . A by-product of the Soviet I.Tnion 's apparent revived interest in d ? tente in Europe may be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question which both have already agreed is today only one for the academics . Next : Bulgaria , wary of revisionism , curbs youth , strives for economic efficiency .
