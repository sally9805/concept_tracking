Dr. John C. Lilly , a deep-chested , suntanned neurophysiologist , has spent a good part of the last four years trying to talk to bottle-nosed dolphins ( Tursiops trnncatus ) , more popularly known as porpoises . So far , he has not found a common language , but already he is convinced that dolphins are far and away the most intelligent beasts on earth . Last week Dr. Lilly , 44 , was hard at work supervising an elaborate new system of jetties and pools that he is constructing , partly with money supplied by the Navy , on a bay six miles from Charlotte Amalie , in the Virgin Islands . <P> Play Ball . Dr. Lilly first learned to admire dolphins at Marineland in Florida , where he watched them entertain tourists . He noticed that they seemed to understand spoken commands , learned quickly the rules and tactics of water polo . Dissection showed that their brains are even bigger than human brains and have as complicated a cerebral cortex , the seat of the higher mental functions . Encouraged by these observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found a spot that gave them exquisite pleasure when it was stimulated by a feeble pulse of electricity . Their eyes lit up and the muscles around their blowholes " smiled . " They became addicted to electrical delight and worked hard to get more of it . Dolphins learned in one demonstration how to operate an apparatus that yields a pleasure-giving jolt . Chimpanzees , which are probably the brightest land animals , need dozens of tries , and even humans do not always get the idea right off . <P> Once when Dr. Lilly was stimulating a dolphin , the electrical apparatus broke down , but a tape recorder kept on running . When he played the tape , he heard his own voice saying , " three hundred twentythree " ( the footage on the tape ) . Then from the dolphin came the same words in a quacking , Donald Ducklike voice , but unmistakable . They were followed by a creditable imitation of the buzz of a transformer and the rattle of a movie camera . The dolphin had associated all these sounds with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> " Mayday . " Dr. Lilly is now convinced that dolphins have an extremely complicated language . They converse in a great variety of buzzes , whistles , rattles and grunts . Since most of the sounds are at higher frequencies than the human ear can hear clearly , Dr. Lilly plays tapes of dolphin talk at quarter speed . So far he has learned only one phrase of dolphin language : the " mayday " distress call , a sharp , up-and-down squeal that sounds like a wolf whistle . <P> Once he put a partially paralyzed dolphin in a pool . As it sank helplessly toward the bottom , it gave its " mayday " call , and the other dolphins rushed to its rescue . They boosted it up to the surface so it could breathe . When it sank again , one of them swam under it , scraping its tender undersurface and triggering a reflex action of its tail that shot it up to the air . The operation was accompanied by a blizzard of dolphin talk .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
