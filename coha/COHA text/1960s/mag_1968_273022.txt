SOUTH VIET NAM <P> The gleaming black hair is no longer neatly combed back . The mustache has been trimmed . Gone is the dashing Captain Midnight look : tailored black flying suit , violet scarf , pearl-handled .38 revolver . At 37 , the Vice President of South Vietnam , Nguyen Cao Ky , has taken to wearing bulky Mao-style suits - and the baggy new look is in keeping with both his sagging political fortunes and his efforts to fashion a new political image . <P> The change in Ky has come swiftly and dramatically , partly the result of accident , partly of the kind of political intrigue with which Viet Nam seems to abound . Before the Communist Tet offensive , Ky was much more than a ceremonial Vice President alongside his rival , President Nguyen Van Thieu . Liked by American officials in Viet Nam , who admired his charm , his boundless energy and his decisiveness , Ky retained powerful friends in the Vietnamese armed forces-an entourage rated strong enough to overthrow Thieu if it ever came to a showdown . But with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. , for the sake of preserving unity in the crisis , could no longer afford to balance between Thieu and Ky . Washington threw its support squarely behind Thieu , and Ky felt left out . <P> Friends Lost . Moodily brooding over his future , he began making public appearances in a Mao suit , and his pronouncements took on distinctly anti-American and anti-Thieu overtones . " If the Americans want to withdraw , they can go ahead , " he told Vietnamese soldiers in Saigon . " We only want people who want to stay . " On another occasion he asked his audience : " Why has South Viet Nam not been able to produce a Ho Chi Minh or Vo Nguyen Giap whom the world admires and respects ? Why have we been unable to produce such people ? Is n't it because our leaders are merely a bunch of servile and corrupt officials ? " <P> Friends fell away . Some were killed in action ; others , like Major General Nguyen Ngoc Loan , the fearless , ruthless , but highly effective National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two weeks ago , a malfunctioning rocket fired from a U.S. helicopter gunship smashed into a forward command post and in one shattering blow wiped out virtually the whole top level of Saigon 's city administration , including four of Ky 's most powerful backers . But by far the greatest damage was caused by President Thieu 's gradual consolidation of power : without consultation , he fired Premier Nguyen Van Loc , a Ky man , and installed Tran Van Huong , whom the Vice President opposed . Police Chief Loan was replaced by a Thieu backer , and Thieu made similar switches to his own advantage in 14 province-chief posts . <P> The Best Only . As his backing dwindled rapidly and his depression deepened , Ky slipped away to the seacoast city of Nha Trang , where he paced up and down the beaches , lost in thought . He returned to Saigon briefly last week , but only for a private goodbye to outgoing U.S. Commander William Westmoreland and to resign as head of the recently instituted Civil Defense Committee .
