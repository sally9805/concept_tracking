Long famed for its bleak deserts , eye-for-an-eye justice and profitable oil wells , Saudi Arabia last week had the added distinction of possessing two monarchs . Profligate King Saud , 62 , who had reigned for eleven years , sulked in his ultra-modern Naziriyah Palace in the capital city of Riyadh . Just down the road in the Red Palace was Saud 's half brother Feisal who two weeks ago was summoned to the throne by a fatwa , or religious edict , issued by a national council composed of 100 princes , assorted sheiks and the ulema ( a body of learned men ) . At the same time the fatwa deposed King Saud , but he refused to abdicate , and no one knew just how to go about making him do it . <P> Deathbed Oath . The two men have long been antagonists . Their father , the late King Ibn Saud once said , " I wish that Feisal had been born twins and Saud had never been born at all . " Nevertheless , Saud was the oldest son and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saud made Feisal swear on the Koran that he would not seek the throne as long as Saud lived . <P> Keeping the oath was not easy . As King , Saud squandered fortunes on his pleasures , chief of which were a huge harem . Next to women , Saud liked air-conditioned Cadillacs best , and next to Cadillacs , intrigue . In contrast , Feisal was almost a puritan : though thrice married , he lives with only one wife at a time and , for the past 20 years , his consort has been Turkish-educated Princess Iffat . He speaks fluent French and English as well as Arabic , and has tried to use his country 's oil millions for the benefit of the people . <P> The pattern of Saudi Arabia has alternated between a few years of mismanagement and waste by nearly illiterate King Saud and then a few years of austerity under Feisal as Premier-until the King felt he could afford to get rid of him again . When Feisal was last called back to power in 1962 for another spell of reform , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privy purse 30% , to a paltry $20 million a year . Cautiously progressive , Feisal also earmarked $500 million for schools , hospitals , roads and water projects . He promised to introduce movies next year , ordered the building of two TV stations and allowed female announcers on the air . As usual , Saud and his wastrel sons conspired with outraged Moslem mullahs who opposed such frivolities and protested that an educated woman is a defiled woman . <P> Sensible Heat . Last September Feisal attended the Alexandria conference of Arab nations and held a series of private meetings with Egypt 's President Gamal Abdel Nasser to patch up the dispute between their two countries over Yemen 's civil war-which last week finally headed for an armistice . Back home , Feisal was depressed to find that King Saud and his sons had been up to their old tricks . Finally , Feisal decided to break his long-kept oath in favor of the national interest . He ordered the national council convened , and while the fatwa was being drawn up , Feisal traveled slowly across the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum attention . Met with the announcement that he was to be King in place of Saud , Feisal professed astonishment but , after prayer and deep reflection , accepted .
