txt barrel . As we opened the door we were met by the most indescribable sound . The house seemed to be alive . From end to end , from floor to rafters , the place was ticking , squeaking and scraping . The wicker chairs were disintegrating into dust ; little inch-long bits of cane had fallen , half-chewed by beetles . Dry rot had got into the roof , and the plasterboard ceiling folded despairingly at the corners . Powdered dust from wood-borers hung in the air . Every corner and cranny was alive with ticking fleas . The house stank of rats and decay . One of our tasks was to gather up Jock 's large collection of woodcarvings which he wanted me to sell for him . When this was done , and when we had tidied the place up as best we could we hurriedly turned our backs and closed the door .

I therefore searched the local shops in Newala for bundles of sisal rope , and several strong builders ' planks . The latter proved difficult to find ; but ultimately , at a shocking price , we managed to hire them on the promise that we left them by the river when we had finished , so that they could be collected later . Then early one morning we set off down the twelve-mile trail to the Rovuma . When we reached the river the news rapidly spread amongst the riverain people that we were planning to cross . This was to prove fortunate for many reasons . Even before we came to the water we found it impossible to get the loaded car across the half-mile stretch of soft sand that separated the flood banks from the water 's edge . The wheels just spun in the sand and sank to the hubs . So finally we had to unload the car , and with the help of all the onlookers , hump the baggage across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a look at the river which , though about a quarter of a mile wide , was very shallow . The water barely came up to my thighs , and I calculated that it should be possible to drive the Land Rover across . The bank the other side was a sheer six-foot drop of sand , so first of all we crossed over and hacked out a track to get the Land Rover up from the water . When that was done I once again checked the route I would take , and re-measured the height of the vital parts of the engine . But being a stupid idiot , I did n't realise that the Land Rover , being 50 rather heavier than me , would sink in the sand . I should have learnt my lesson on the soft dry sand ; but under the water it seemed hard and firm . So I drove the car straight into the river . We went about twenty or thirty yards out and all was well . But then we suddenly hit a soft patch , and the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to change gear to keep up speed . Then ? woomph ! As I changed gear the car momentarily halted , and nothing I could do would make it move again . Instead , the more throttle I gave it , the more it chewed its way down into the sand . The water rose rapidly over the engine . Somehow I had to keep the motor running . If that stopped , I would be in dire trouble . Furthermore , if it had been raining in the hills upstream , at any moment the level of the river might rise a foot or more ; and I began to have visions of my home , my transport , my worldly belongings , and my entire safari being washed away to the sea . From behind the wheel I shouted at Rashidi to get everyone round the front of the car . They refused . They just stood and looked . I shouted at them and cursed them . They wanted money . How much money ? I offered them fifty cents each . They refused . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile the engine was getting perilously near to drowning , and the wheels were being washed deeper into the sand . You bastards ! One shilling . O.K. , they agreed to one shilling . But they wanted the money first . I called them every name under the sun . I look very funny when I get angry ; and this did it . They burst into laughter and gathered round the car . Now I told Rashidi to get a couple of our planks , and as everyone lifted , to push the planks under the wheels . But the wheels were down to the hub-caps . They could n't lift them high enough . They tried to scrape out the sand , but as fast as they scraped , new sand was washed into its place . They tried to lift again , but failed . There were no more people . I was getting blue in the face with worry by now . I just had to keep that damned engine running at all costs . They tried a third time . No luck . O.K. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't lift the wheels above the level of the sand , but lift them enough to put the planks down under them , even if at a sharp angle . I hoped that I might then be able , in low ratio reverse gear , to drive the Land-Rover up on to the planks . They got the planks in ; and very gingerly I put the car in gear and let out the clutch . For a moment the wheels skidded on the wet planks ; but 51 they gripped just enough to push them a fraction further underneath , and slowly ? very , very slowly ? they climbed up on to the wood . Taking no chances , we laid a track back to the bank with the other planks , and drove the car to safety . Never was I so relieved to feel soft dry sand under my wheels . After that I called together some of the local boatmen ; and at a cost of six pounds , over and above Lord knows how many shillings for carrying baggage and retrieving the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lashed them together , and floated the car safely across to Mocambique . Once over the river , we had to cross about a mile of bush and mud , pot-holed with the tracks of elephant and hippo , before we reached a small village and a track that led up to the Makonde plateau . The road was rough and rocky . It twisted and turned through densely thick bush and forests of bamboo , occasionally breaking out across a small clearing in the forest where local Africans were lazily hoeing plantations of cotton . About twelve miles up the track we came to the Portuguese Administrative post of Ngapa . Ngapa was the opposite number to Newala , and like the Tanganyika frontier post , was perched high on a ridge overlooking the Rovuma valley . The District Commissioner at Newala had advised me to stop here and make my presence known to the Portuguese officials . The reputation of the Portuguese administrators was not the best . I had heard people say that they disliked stray Englishmen wandering around their territory ; that they were frightened that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was only later on that I got to know something of the Portuguese colonial system . In the meantime I wondered what sort of official would greet me at Ngapa . Armando Mendes da Silva , the Chefe do Posto , was a little man who wore a topee a size too large for him . His big nose gave him a bird-like look . He was very quiet ; in fact he seemed to be half asleep . When I arrived , he was inspecting a platoon of dishevelled policemen , and until he had finished he seemed not even to have noticed my presence . He was not being rude , but he was so dreamy by nature that even if I had been Salazar himself I do n't think his reaction would have been any different . When he did finally come over to me he was so bewildered by the fact that we had no common language that he began to relapse again into his dream-world. 52 Eventually we had to converse through a Swahili-Portuguese interpreter . I got to know Armando Mendes quite well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours with his family at Ngapa . His house , a dapper little bungalow decorated with potted plants , ebony and ivory trinkets , and a bidet in the bathroom , was a small piece of Portugal transplanted . It was , in fact , the object of his dreams ; for Armando Mendes was an outcast in a far-flung province who longed for nothing more than to be at home in Portugal . Of all the Portuguese administrators I met he was by far the most gentle and pleasant . I felt rather sorry for him , for he obviously loathed the vicious administrative system of which he was part ; but being a very junior officer he was powerless to do anything but go along with it and profit by it where he could . Having had our passports stamped we set out on the last lap of our journey to the Makonde country . Now if the north bank of the Rovuma had been known for centuries , the south bank , and the Makonde plateau in particular , remained unknown to Europeans until relatively recent times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no natural harbours on the coast immediately south of the Rovuma , so the south bank never became an Arab or African trade route . Secondly , as the Makonde plateau lies well over a thousand miles from the capital of Mocambique , Lourenco Marques , and as it contains no natural riches , the Portuguese colonisers have never had much interest in it ; and thirdly , the plateau is waterless ? the women have to walk ten miles into the valley below to fetch water ? and people have found it hard to live there . Finally , the Makonde tribe who inhabit it have long been recognised as some of the most savage people in East Africa . More powerful neighbours such as the famous Angoni , unable to defeat and absorb the Makonde , were content to pass them by ? just as were the Arabs and the Portuguese . The latter made no attempt , to bring this wild region under administrative control until after the first world war , and there was no permanent white occupation there until 1923 . In books on classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern part of Africa that are ever mentioned , though they are generally considered to be of minor importance compared with the great artists of the West coast . They are always erroneously described by anthropologists as living in Tanganyika ; but although there is a Makonde tribe north of the Rovuma river , they are a 53 relatively recent offshoot of their more interesting relatives in Mocambique . The Mocambique Makonde are frequently referred to as the " Mawia " tribe , but this is no more than a nickname meaning " the angry people " given to them by their neighbours . The Makonde have a fable referring to their origin which bears directly on their skill as craftsmen . In the beginning , so the fable goes , there was an old man , half-creature , who lived alone in the wilds . He never washed and his hair was long and greasy ; his skin was rotten with sores . One day he took up his knife and a piece of wood , and from it he carved a figurine . He stood the figurine outside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , so that when the old man awoke in the morning he found in its place a living woman . For some time he lived with this woman down by a river , and presently she had a baby . But the baby was still-born . Interpreting this as a bad omen , he moved his shelter over the hill , and settled down near another river . Soon the woman had another baby ; but again it was still-born . So once more he uprooted himself and his home , and this time went to live on top of the plateau . A third baby was born , and this time it lived . Thenceforth all his offspring were enjoined to live on the plateau in the thick , thorny bush that was called " konde " . So there came into being the people of the " konde " , or the Makonde . And now Rashidi and I , as soon as we had left the Chefe do Posto at Ngapa , began to pass through Makonde country . As we did so Rashidi grew more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot and torn to shreds at a cannibal feast he was scared stiff , poor man ; and as groups of semi-naked savages shouted at us , flashing their filed teeth and waving their bows and arrows , he closed his eyes and slumped down in his seat . A little ashamed of his fear , he said he was tired after the trouble we had had crossing the river , but it was quite surprising how he came to life as we left each village behind us . We were heading now for a little village called Lipelwa , where there was a mission station run by the Montfort Fathers , and we had an introduction to the man in charge from Jock . He was an old Dutchman , short and bent , with long white hair , named Father Vloet . Father Vloet had been the first white man to settle in Makonde country , five years after the first world war had ended . For the first seven years he had toiled in vain amongst the proud and primitive Makonde people , and it was not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since then his flock had grown to sizeable proportions , and scattered throughout his district he now had eight other missionaries to help him . One of these , Father Van Bergen , lived with him at Lipelwa , and between them the two missionaries found plenty to keep them occupied . Father Vloet was the Evangelist and Builder , spending his non-praying hours making bricks for the church he had been building for fifteen years . Father Van Bergen was the Provider , who , though he too prayed occasionally , spent most of his time in the bush hunting elephants . The missionaries were kind to us , and invited us to stay with them . Though neither Rashidi nor I spoke Portuguese , Dutch , or Simakonde , we were able to converse with them through a Makonde servant who spoke Kiswahili . I told them why I had come ? that I wanted to make a collection of masks and other carvings ? and they promised me all the help they could give . They told me that being English would make things easier for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found it very difficult , for the Makonde loathed their colonial masters like poison . Life at the mission station was austere but not uncomfortable . As eggs were threepence a dozen , and chickens a shilling each , these formed the basis of the missionary diet . But as Father Van Bergen , the Provider , was not the sort of person to let us think he was no good at his job , he saw to it that there was always a plentiful supply of wine . He himself drank wine ? for breakfast , elevenses , lunch , tea , and dinner . He washed it down with Bois after dinner and fumigated his insides with revoltingly pungent Dutch cheroots . I spent the first few days visiting neighbouring villages , putting the word about that I wanted to buy masks and any other carvings . Rashidi remained behind at the mission station on these occasions at his own request . He had no desire to stick his neck out any further than necessary . One of the first places I visited was a small village called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Makonde villages lies actually on the sandy roads that criss-cross the plateau ; but they are easy to spot as all are linked to the highways by paths as straight as arrows cut through the thick bush , and often neatly planted with rows of sisal or flowering shrubs . I had never before seen such paths in Africa , as few Africans have an eye for a straight line and even fewer care about flowers . When I came to 55 Mboo I left my car on the road , and walked up the path to the village at the far end . This consisted of two concentric circles of well-built rectangular thatched huts around an open space planted with mango , orange , and lime trees . Like most other Makonde villages it was spotlessly clean and in the centre of the open space was a small grass shelter where the villagers could meet to smoke and chat . Beneath the shelter several men were busily at work , carving . One had an elephant 's tusk on which he was incising miniature scenes from Makonde life ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in high relief . Another was chipping at a chunk of ebony with an adze , forming a beautiful head with a tall , mitre-like head-dress . When I strolled in alone , these carvers looked up at me with some surprise . Thinking that I was Portuguese they fell silent ? eyeing me suspiciously , wondering why I had come . When I spoke to them in Kiswahili their surprise was even greater , and they were delighted when they discovered I was English . Except for " Bwana Kazi " ( Mr. Work ? whom I later discovered was Jock ) they had never before seen an Englishman in their country . The babble of excitement caused by my arrival brought people running from their huts , to the shelter , where most of them stood in silence staring at me curiously as though I was some strange wild animal . Their spokesman was one of the carvers , a fearsome-looking man named Gogo whose incisor teeth were filed to a point , and whose face and torso were covered in cicatrised tribal markings . I told him why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy some masks ? " mpiko " , as they are called . At the mention of mpiko a deathly hush fell over the crowd . Gogo looked around him nervously , then all of a sudden he jumped up and with a frightening yell chased all the women and boys away from the hut . One or two of the men looked at me reproachfully , nodding their heads and clicking their teeth , saying that it is not good to mention mpiko in front of women or small children who may only see or hear about masks when they are being used in a tribal dance . But their anger was short-lived , and after a few minutes they led me away to where the mpiko were kept . The mask-house was a small thatched hut hidden in a dense piece of bush two minutes ' walk from the village . At the entrance to the path leading up to it were two sticks , signifying that only 56 full-grown men were allowed beyond this point . Yet , despite this rule , which no one would dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the mpiko were mentioned in hushed , awe-stricken tones . Now that we were going to look at the masks , Gogo , who seemed to be a man of some authority in the village , posted a guard by the path to make doubly sure that no unauthorised person followed us in . Then he led me inside . Though there were no windows , sufficient light filtered through the doorway for me to see that the hut appeared to be quite empty . I had expected to see racks , or pegs , with masks hanging from them ; but no ? the place was absolutely bare . For a moment I wondered whether I was being fooled , or thought perhaps that I had misunderstood them . But then Gogo , reaching up under the darkened eaves brought down a bundle wrapped in several layers of black cloth , and unravelling this with great care , he revealed a mask . It was an extraordinary , helmet-shaped object , rather terrifying , and ugly beyond belief . It represented a man obviously of Gogo 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black wax depicting the elaborate patterns of the Makonde tribal markings ; and its hair was human hair , pressed into the soft white wood from which the mpiko was made . As their masks appeared so sacred to the Makonde I wondered whether or not they would be willing to sell them . Though most of them were so gruesome that I could not imagine that any European or American would want them to hang up as wall decorations , I wanted to buy quite a large number for Al and Nat to distribute to various museums in the United States . But when I suggested buying them to Gogo , he willingly agreed . Furthermore , after consultations with the other men , the price he asked was astonishingly cheap ? only five shilling per mask . The reason for this was that , being made of very soft " njala " wood ? the wood of the cotton tree ? they were easy to make , and their antiquity was of no importance to the - Makonde . They were hidden away not for the sake of preservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed sometimes they did not hide them in huts at all , but in particularly dense patches of undergrowth . There was an occasion later on when we were looking for a mask hidden in the bush when it took the man who hid it twenty-five minutes to find it . So I bought that mask at Mboo , and several others besides . The dance for which the masks are used is the central feature of 57 Makonde ritual life . Whilst in their country I saw this dance performed on numerous occasions , and it was like no other that I ever saw elsewhere in Africa . The whole village , men , women and children , were assembled in an open clearing out in the bush , arranged in a horseshoe around the arena . At the open end of the horseshoe were the drummers beating out a fantastically rapid , high-pitched rhythm like the sound of hailstones pattering on sheets of corrugated iron . For some time the drummers played while the women around the arena clapped and sang to their rhythm . Suddenly into this cacophony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garments , sprang the Lipiko ? the dancer with the mask ? who rushed in from the bush , beating his feet upon the ground , prancing round the line of women who now cowered away from him in silent fear . For several minutes , while the drums beat on incessantly , the awesome figure of the dancer charged the terrified crowd , stopping short as he appeared about to strike them . Then as the drums beat faster 58 and faster to a climax , a signal was given to the crowd who , with one accord , turned on the dancer , shouting and yelling , chasing him ignominiously from their midst ? back to the bush from which his spirit form had leapt . Though the precise meaning of the Makonde dance was difficult to establish , it was , according to Father Vloet , originally a war dance . Most of their masks portray people other than men from their own village , and used to represent an attacking enemy . The powerful " enemy " charges into the arena and at first terrifies the villagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bush . Father Vloet told me that in times gone by villagers used to hurl stones at the dancer and beat him with sticks during the last part of the dance , and it was not unknown for a dancer actually to be killed . Destruction of the " enemy " in this spirit form was supposed to give the Makonde power to defeat him in real life . Such magic is quite common throughout the primitive world , and is called " sympathetic magic " . It is this sort of thing that can be seen in the most ancient cave paintings , thousands of years old , in which wild animals are being " killed " by the arrows of hunters . Since tribal and internecine battles were stopped by the Portuguese , the Makonde dance has lost its point as a war dance . But it would seem that with a deep psychological twist there was no reason why the sympathetic magical powers of the dances should have ended there . I saw dances that suggested that its magical powers were being used for many other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , I saw one dance in which the lipiko , dressed as a girl , was scattering corn from a basket . This appeared to be directed at ensuring fertility and good crops during the coming season . There was another of a very different nature , obviously directed at a homosexual member of the village ? homosexuality being rare and strongly frowned upon in most African societies . There were two dancers , one of whom was miming the motions of buggery on the other . Yet another involved a man and two small boys dressed as girls whom he was attempting to " rape " , getting frenziedly excited in the process . This was obviously addressed to a " cradle-snatcher " in the village , and the idea in both these dances was that by making a public example of the culprit in spirit form , they hoped to shame him into giving up his activities in real life . In that way , venting their wrath indirectly , the Makonde could clean up their society without being forced to take any direct 59 punitive action on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Makonde of Tanganyika also ; though here the dance form is different , and the lipiko performs on enormous stilts for reasons that no one seems to know . This stilt dancing , though not as exciting as the dancing in Mocambique , showed a remarkable degree of acrobatic skill , and it was strange to see the dancers at rest , sitting casually on the roofs of houses as though they were stools . The most extraordinary example of sympathetic magic I witnessed was on an occasion when a lipiko came prancing into an arena wearing a mask of none other than " Kwini Elizabeti Yapili wa Waingilesa " ? Queen Elizabeth the Second of England . The Queen was referred to by name , and though the mask itself was no flattering work of art , there was no doubt whom it was supposed to represent from the crown on its head . The dance that Her 60 Majesty performed was as fast and furious as any of the others , but they treated this mask with particular respect , and everything about it indicated that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire into this magical being they hoped that sooner or later they might bring about a change of rulers . In another village I saw a similar dance performed in which an " American sailor " , heavily ornamented with Makonde markings , was the central figure . This occurred shortly after a U.S. naval ship had put in at Mtwara on the Tanganyika coast ; and no doubts were left about the lipiko 's meaning when one of the audience came up to me and asked pathetically , " When are the Americans going to take over from the Portuguese ? " All these masks , whether the Queen , an American sailor , missionaries , ugly Portuguese policemen , or neighbouring tribesmen , were treated with the same reverence and fear by the Makonde people . This was made clear on countless occasions as I watched the precautions they took to hide them from those who were supposed not to see them . One such instance concerned Gogo who , after our first meeting , acted as an agent for me , collecting masks from other villages which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Outside my room at the mission was a small balcony with a low wall along the front , beyond which was an open garden stretching nearly two hundred yards to the nearest forest . Standing at my window one morning I caught sight of a figure moving furtively about the bushes on the edge of the forest . Suddenly , as though stung by a scorpion , the man broke cover and raced across the garden towards my room . It was Gogo , and under his arm was a bundle wrapped in the familiar black cloth . As he pounded across the clearing he glanced over his shoulder to right and left to make sure that no one was watching him , and when he came to the house ? though there was not , a soul in sight ? he hurled himself down behind the verandah wall where for a moment he lay , oblivious that I was watching him , panting from exhaustion . Then slowly , and cautiously , like a soldier under fire , with only his backside visible above the wall , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the window with a heavy sigh of relief . Only when he had got his breath back did he look up at , me 61 triumphantly and whisper , " Mpiko ! " And from under layers of cloth he produced the mask . The Makonde sincerely believed that if a woman were to set eyes on a mask , when not being worn in a dance , her " eyes would roll in their sockets till only the whites showed " , and she might go mad , become sterile , or even die . With some of the more primitive amongst them their belief in the power of the mask went even further . When I asked one gorilla-like man whether white ants ate the mpiko when they were hidden in the bush , he replied emphatically " No ! They are afraid , for they know that if they eat the mpiko they will die ! " Before I left the Makonde plateau I collected between forty and fifty masks of different types ; but ironically , after all those weeks , traipsing around the bush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not within three thousand miles of Mocambique . Two or three years later , in London , I was browsing round the shelves of one of the leading primitive art dealers in England when , high up on a shelf , almost out of sight , I suddenly noticed a very unusual mask . To me it was unmistakably Makonde , for it had the same facial markings and other characteristics . It was particularly unusual in that it was neither a face mask such as those worn by the northern Makonde , 62 nor a full helmet mask worn by the southern Makonde . It was what is called a " half-helmet mask " which covers the face but has a piece extending . I asked the dealer if he knew anything about it , but until he had checked his lists he was not even sure it was Makonde . In any event he had no idea it was particularly unusual , and as , like most Makonde masks , it was not particularly beautiful to western eyes , it had been sitting up there on the shelf for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rather high , but after a bit of bargaining I persuaded him to let me have it for rather less than half the list price ? just to get it out of his way . He wrapped it ; I thanked him and , jumping into a taxi , drove straight round to the British Museum . Within half an hour I had sold it to them ( at a handsome profit ) and -a few weeks later it was published as the frontispiece of the Royal Anthropological Institute 's magazine Man ? one of the finest and most unusual Makonde masks known . The elaborate markings with which the Makonde decorate their masks are exactly the same as the designs that they frequently " cicatrise " on their bodies , from forehead to thigh . The Makonde are the supreme masters of this art on the African continent , and though the effect is sometimes similar to tattooing , cicatrising is a 63 very different process . Whereas tattooing is done by injecting a pigment under the skin , cicatrising is done by cutting the flesh , rubbing powdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to form a black scar . Both men and women are cicatrised , and the designs used may at one time have had some symbolic significance , but if this was ever the case , their meanings have now been forgotten . If cicatrisation makes the Makonde look grotesque , the lip-plugs that their womenfolk wear make them even more so . The lip-plugs of Makonde women in Tanganyika , though nowhere near as large as those of some tribes in western Africa , are sometimes two or three inches in diameter . Those of the Portuguese Makonde women are smaller but from them protrudes a spike which presses against their noses giving even the most attractive amongst them a strangely pig-like look . In one village I discovered a very old man wearing a lip-plug decorated with coloured beads . I was told that many years ago all the menfolk used to wear them ; but when I was there 64 only two such men survived , and by now they are doubtless both dead . It is not known for certain why the Makonde mess their bodies about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One is that they feel it , genuinely enhances their beauty . The other is that in the olden days it made them less attractive to slave dealers . There is probably some truth in both theories , though today , more and more young children are refusing to be cicatrised , as they rightly believe it will make it more difficult for them to find good jobs when they grow up . Their extraordinary appearance is probably the reason why other Africans believe they are cannibals . There is certainly no other evidence that they eat people , and even Rashidi , when he had overcome his initial fears , was forced to admit that the Makonde were not only pleasant people , but also that they were more hospitable to " foreign " Africans such as himself than most other tribesmen he had met . Even if the Makonde do not eat people , some of the things they do eat are certainly curious . They love snakes ? not only python which is eaten in many places , but , small grass-snakes as well . They go delirious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steak ( which , having tried myself , I can genuinely appreciate ) . And they also eat mice and rats . Walking through the bush one day I came upon a little hut outside which was a small boy , eleven or twelve years old , sitting in front of a fire , cooking . He was totally absorbed in what he was doing , and took no notice of me even when I sat down near him to watch . On the ground beside him he had laid out two sticks , and upon these was the object of his attentions , a pile of rats . With great care he took each rat in turn , stuck a stick through its body , end to end , and roasted it over the flames . When the rat , which had had neither skin , entrails , nor anything else removed , was cooked to a crisp brown , he sprinkled it with salt and replaced it on the sticks . There were eight or ten rats in all , and he was cooking them for his chums just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " twists " with flour and water . The hut outside which he was sitting was the boys ' initiation hut in which all the boys of initiation age in the neighbourhood spend five or six months learning the secrets of manly existence . Tribal initiation is still very important amongst the Makonde . During the long initiation " term " they are not allowed to visit their homes , // nor receive any visitors . With the help of only one " master " , they have to look after themselves entirely . It gives them tremendous confidence and makes them feel and behave like men . If they are not considered adult enough after their six-month course , they go back again the next year ; and sometimes one comes across boys of eighteen and nineteen who are still not initiated . I came in for the final initiation celebration on one occasion at which everyone greeted the new initiates at a three-day party in the village . Initiation generally accompanies circumcision and marks the attainment of manhood sexually as in every other way . These celebrations were marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the world . The ceremony , which seemed to be the climax of the whole affair , was marked by considerable modesty , bashfulness and humour . The boys were instructed to take their clothes off , and in front of the whole village they filed past one of the elders whose job it was to perform the blessing . In a bowl beside him was an oily black liquid , and as each boy came past he first daubed his forehead with the liquid , then , dipping an instrument like a ring spanner into it , passed this several times over each boy 's penis . I must have shown my surprise , for the crowd suddenly started laughing at me , whereupon the old man came up to me and asked if I too would like to be blessed . Apparently this was an infallible prophylactic against venereal diseases , impotence and lack of virility . I declined hurriedly . In three or four weeks , besides buying the masks , most of which were more of ethnographic interest , I paid out about ? 80 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was able to sell at a very good profit . Though these included a few traditional pieces such as clubs with heads carved in the form of faces , gourd-bungs , and carved powder-horns , most of them were curios covering the same range of subjects as those of the Wazaramo and the Wakamba . The quality of the Makonde carving was far superior to that of the other tribes , and significant features of the classical tradition were worked into their designs . Now the time came to pack them up as before , and get them to the coast to be shipped to New York . Armando Mendes da Silva had told me there was a high export duty on native crafts ; and with the amount I had , I would have had to pay about ? 60 in duty . I was damned if I was going to do this if I could avoid it , so I decided to smuggle them across to 66 Tanganyika , and ship them from there duty free . The snag was that to get to the river I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had asked me to let him know if ever I was going down to the frontier . I was n't particularly keen to see the inside of a Portuguese prison , and I had learnt by then that they had no compunction about putting visiting English inside if they had half an excuse . There was only one thing to do , and that was to drive past his house and hope for the best . I had two things on my side . First , his 67 house was on a hillside , and the road sloped quite steeply past it . Secondly , like every good Portuguese , I knew he always , unfailingly , took a long siesta in the afternoon . With careful timing , I planned to arrive at Ngapa , with my Land Rover stacked to the roof with crates , at the siesta hour . To make sure I did n't wake him I would coast down the hill past his house . But , when the time came , luck was against me . As I freewheeled down towards his house a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me to stop . If I stopped he would certainly see my load and become suspicious . But I guessed that if I drove straight past we would surely have time to get the load across the river before Armando Mendes had a chance to wake up and catch up . So I put my foot down , and sped on down the Rovuma road , leaving the policeman gaping after us , shaking his fist with fury . I parked the car in the little village about a mile from the river , and hastily collecting up all the men and women I could find , we head-loaded the carvings down to the frontier on the first leg of their journey to New York . I had sent a runner ahead to an Indian merchant in Newala to get him to meet me at the river , and we carried the cargo across without mishap . When I got back to Ngapa I found Armando Mendes sipping a glass of wine in his dressing-gown . He had n't heard I had been past . The African policeman had obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was out collecting , I used to spend many hours talking to Africans about the Portuguese . They loathed them ; and from all I ever discovered ( and corroborated ) they had every justification . The Chefe do Posto of one of the Makonde villages was a particularly unpleasant man in their eyes . If an African failed to salute him as he drove down the road , the Chefe would have him put inside and given twenty-five or fifty strokes of the " balamatola " , this being the local word for that pernicious form of torture , the bastinado , with which the palms of the hands and soles of the feet are beaten until they are raw . These frontier Africans were in a particularly frustrating position . Across in Tanganyika , goods in the shops were as little as a third of the price of equivalent , goods in Mocambique . Conversely , wages in Mocambique were far lower than in Tanganyika . ( A Mocambique African , after six months ' compulsory labour on a nearby sisal estate , came away on average with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency was to shop in Tanganyika twenty miles away . Penalties if caught taking produce or bringing goods across the river were severe , involving prison sentences , and up to a hundred strokes of the bastinado . It was very difficult to stop the Makonde , however , for only they knew the bush paths . It often astonished me how little the Portuguese knew about Africa or the Africans . I never met a single Portuguese administrator who could speak any local language , and most of them seemed utterly callous about the people , selling their labour for personal profit to Portuguese estate owners , and treating them like slaves . It was their ignorance of the local language that eventually brought about my own departure . One day Father Van Bergen came into my room , and in place of the usual smile his face was like a stone wall . He spoke to me somewhat sharply , simply saying that he was very sorry but that I would have to leave immediately . Would I go after lunch , or if not , early the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me no explanation for this ; he was severe , yet at the same time he seemed rather sorry having to talk like this . He said something about it being a rule of the mission that no one could stay longer than a certain period ; but this , I knew from earlier conversations , was completely untrue . Father Van Bergen had that morning been in the district headquarters talking to the administrators for the Makonde , and judging from a conversation I had with his driver , I am pretty sure I know what happened . It was simply that the Portuguese did not like an Englishman wandering about from village to village , talking to Africans in a language that they could not themselves understand . They knew as well as anyone that the Africans loathed their guts ; they knew too that many of their own Africans were already members of TANU , the Tanganyika political organisation . They distrusted my presence and simply wanted to get , rid of me . As there was no hotel within sixty miles where I could stay , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave Mocambique altogether . I had no desire to make things difficult for the missionaries , so early the next day Rashidi and I packed up the remains of our collections , loaded everything into the Land Rover , and rather sorrowfully said good-bye to them . Being Dutch , they were already in a 69 tricky enough position with the Portuguese , and I am quite certain they were sorry to see us go in this way . My original plan , on leaving the Makonde , was to drive down through Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia , and from there to go up into the Congo . There was therefore no need to re-cross the Rovuma into Tanganyika , and we set off down dreadful roads across the northern part of Mocambique . Nyasaland lay only four hundred miles to the west , but this was a two-day journey . When darkness fell on the first , day we came into the small town of Marupa . I knew there was no hotel or rest-house here , but I hoped we might be able to find a bed somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . To be quite honest , I was fully prepared to scrounge off the Portuguese if I could . It turned out to be easier than I expected , for as we drove past a row of houses the front door of one of them opened , and a tall young man came down the path towards his car . I drew up behind him . " Pardon , monsieur ... " I always tried my French on the Portuguese first as more of them seemed to understand that than English . " Can you tell me , please , how I get to the hotel ? " A blind opening , as I already knew there was none . The young man replied in English . " Ah ! You are English man , no ? So please let us talk English language , as I speak it very very well . But Sir , pardon me , and accept regrets ; there is no hotel in Marupa . " " Oh dear ... " My jaw dropped in mock bewilderment . The young man saw my evident distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . " But people back in Montepuez told me there was ... " I went on , lying outrageously . But there was no need to worry . The young man suddenly drew himself up to his full height , clicked his heels , and addressed me as though I were an important ambassador on an official visit . " Sir . Please to introduce myself as the Portuguese Chefe do Posto of Marupa . It is the policy of my government to be hospitable to English persons . You will therefore kindly stay with me ! " Another click of the heels , a little bow , and we drove off to his house . My host was very pleasant . Indeed , he was showing me a side of the Portuguese colonials that , is undeniably charming . On the surface they are the most hospitable people . They ply you with 70 wine to saturation point , and make it their business to see that you are comfortable . On more than one occasion I met Portuguese who seemed to consider it part of their duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lay a hint as to their character . Africans to them are chattels . They consider it part of their " civilising mission " in Africa to make the able-bodied men work , with or without pay ; but as they have a genuine disregard for skin colour they have no qualms about taking an African mistress . There is no colour bar in Mocambique , and Africans can achieve full Portuguese citizenship if they are considered " civilised " enough . If they are not " civilised " , ( and in Portuguese eyes only a handful are ) , then they are animals and are treated as such . The country is ruled by force , as I saw clearly the next day when I was taken to the Administrator of Marupa . On a table beside his desk lay a loaded submachine gun . Tens of thousands of Africans have migrated from Mocambique into neighbouring British territories ? 400,000 alone to Nyasaland . The effect of this mass migration became astonishingly clear the day we left Marupa . For over two hundred miles Rashidi and I drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great tribes , the Ngoni and Yao . Yet we scarcely saw a soul . We went through scattered villages in which a few dispirited and thin figures rose to salute us as we passed . Then , when we came to the Nyasaland border , we passed through a gate in a stone wall and suddenly entered a totally different world . On one side hundreds of miles of empty forests ; and on the other , every square inch of land under cultivation ? thriving villages through which lorries raced , scattering pigs , chickens and children . From a dead land to a land of the living . Yet , only a hundred years ago , Livingstone had found this part of Nyasaland ravaged by poverty and disease , and sparsely populated . There is little wonder that the Portuguese are worried about their " overseas provinces " , as their colonies are known . There is little wonder they are frightened by the ogre of revolution that hangs perpetually over their heads . Bullets will be their only hope ; but ultimately they can not succeed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salisbury in Southern Rhodesia , where I arranged to spend a week or two with some friends . Rashidi was , of course , quite out of his element here , and as we were beyond the fringes of Swahili-speaking Africa I was the only person with whom he could talk . Yet , 71 determined neither to let me down , nor give a bad impression of Tanganyika 's people , Rashidi came into his own . It was Christmas time , and my friends had a sizeable house party . Undeterred , Rashidi put on his cleanest raiment , and plunged straight into the kitchen . There he took over control . He was appalled by the way the cook was dishing up the dinner ; so showed him how to do it . He was disgusted by the houseboys ' slovenliness when serving at table ; so without a word he took over . My hosts were highly amused ; but more than that- they had never before thought it possible that an African servant could be so well trained . This delighted Rashidi , but he greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But sadly my time with Rashidi now came to an end . While in Salisbury he had a letter from relatives in Morogoro saying that his son was seriously ill , and asking him to go home . Very reluctantly , therefore , I put him on a bus back to Tanganyika . I greatly missed him when , after a week or two , I packed up once again and continued my journey to the Congo . // Woodcarvers of the Congo I set out on the next part of my journey with high hopes . Travelling via Bulawayo and the Victoria Falls , I planned to visit an area considered by some experts to be once the richest of all the art areas in the continent of Africa . This was the vast territory that was then the Belgian Congo and I intended first to visit Leopoldville and Brazzaville . Then , coming up the Congo River , I would head back across the whole width of Africa to Mombasa having , I hoped , scooped up a valuable haul of treasures en route . This would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the Rhodesias there was not a lot to be found either in the way of curios or art . With the exception of one or two areas , in the far north-west where the Batchokwe tribe spread across the borders from Angola , and in a few parts of Barotseland , there has never been much traditional work produced here , so I decided to head directly towards the Congo . I did , however , spend two days in Livingstone where I packed and despatched several crates of Barotse curios . Barotse , or Lozi , carving is not unlike that of the Wakamba , and the carvers of this area have risen to fame and fortune in much the same way as their brethren in Kenya ? on the recent tide of tourism . But both Al and Nat had asked me not to send too much from here as they were already receiving regular supplies from other people . From Livingstone I drove on , across the frontier , to Elisabethville , the capital of . Katanga in the southern Congo . A friend in Southern Rhodesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Belgian named Laurent Moonens who ran an art school for Africans . So as soon as I arrived I went along to the Academie des Beaux Arts where I understood Laurent was to be found . Laurent Moonens , himself an artist on the way to becoming quite well known in Belgium , had originally come out to the Congo for 73 a short period , on a commission from the Belgian government to paint a number of official pictures . While out there , however , he had been appalled by the lack of interest shown by colonial educationalists in the encouragement of art among African children . And there and then he decided to stay in the Congo to set up an experimental " school " to encourage aspiring young African artists . When I found Laurent ? a quiet and unassuming man in his thirties ? he was just off home , so he invited me back with him for lunch . During the meal he told me the history of his Academie , and 74 how he was trying to run it . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had no more than three young pupils in their early teens whom he had found in one of the schools run by the Union Miniere mining concern . From the start one of the basic features of his experiment was to avoid giving the children any technical teaching . To set them down in front of a model and teach them to draw would , he felt , be inviting disaster in that it would kill the spontaneity , imagination , and feeling that he hoped to get his children to express . So what he did was simply to give them paint and paper and let them do whatever they wished . The first Academie was an open grass shelter on the outskirts of Elisabethville , and the artists ' drawing boards and tables were old wooden boxes . And the results were astonishing . He found that the children , sons of Bushongo and Baluba tribesmen , had an amazing natural ability to express themselves in a remarkably coherent way . Before long , as news of the exciting " discovery " of painting spread amongst other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came voluntarily not only from school in Elisabethville , but from other areas hundreds of miles away . When the Academie grew too large for grass huts , he was eventually able to move it , with official backing , to a fine modern building where it became a fully-fledged school , providing its young artists with a general education in addition to art facilities . In his home , Laurent had a collection of over four hundred paintings from the Academie . So when lunch was over we moved into the next room to look through these , and they turned out to be some of the most extraordinary and colourful pictures I had ever set eyes on . Inevitably a certain style had developed within the school , and all the paintings had some fascinating things in common . Given a range of colours far greater than anything available in the bush , the young Africans had shown astonishing colour perception . No attempt whatsoever was made to depict a third dimension , yet despite this lack of perspective they achieved a tremendous feeling of depth by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly taken from the world that the artists knew best ? the bush . There were animals and birds of all descriptions ; snakes entwined round jungle trees ; and violent , fantastically lively tribal dances . One of the favourite subjects was men fishing , or carrying their day 's catch on poles along the water 's edge with fishes clearly visible under the water at the bottom of the painting . 75 The effect in these " water " scenes was identical to reliefs in many Egyptian tombs , in which boats float over myriads of fishes and reptiles depicted underneath . I asked Laurent if they could have seen reproductions of these Egyptian reliefs ; but he was sure they had not . A few paintings were of towns ? one which depicted an ambulance rushing to the scene of a road accident was dramatic and packed with humour and observation . When we had done with this feast of colour and imagination I asked if I could buy a few paintings . As a special concession Laurent let me have a dozen ; but generally he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pupils would discover the commercial possibilities of their work and begin churning them out by the thousand for sale to tourists . This he rightly felt would be the beginning of the end of the Academie , as was in fact the case with another art studio I visited later , on this safari . As I left Laurent I could not help reflecting that , given the opportunity and encouragement , there might well be a very interesting rebirth of art in Africa . This school in Elisabethville was not unique on the continent , but nothing of its type existed in East Africa . In fact , apart from an over-sophisticated art school at Makerere College in Uganda , art teaching in East African schools was non-existent . I think the lack of official interest in Kenya , Tanganyika and Uganda stemmed from the fact that the East African territories had no traditional arts upon which to draw , and it was therefore considered that the people themselves were inevitably inartistic . But it occurred to me now , that just because East Africans had no previous experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to suppose that they had no latent talent which should be encouraged in every way . Pondering over these facts gave me ideas that I later followed up when I returned to Kenya . Leaving Elisabethville , I drove north into the town of Kamina in the territory of the Baluba . I had been given an introduction to an English missionary couple here named Womersley , who were said to know more about the Baluba tribe than anyone else . They , if anyone , I had been told , would be the people to put me in touch with the best Baluba artists . One of the great things about travelling in Africa is that you need never find isolation or loneliness unless you are looking for it . There is barely a corner of the continent where mission stations have not been established , and I found very early on that far from 76 being considered a nuisance when I drove up to a mission station and asked for a bed , I was usually welcomed . Most missionaries lead a somewhat isolated life , and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially if their guest is interested in the people amongst whom they are working . Their hospitality is usually frugal , as one might expect , but always sincere and enjoyable . So it was with the Womersleys whom I found living in a modem house on the outskirts of Kamina township . These two had been living amongst the Baluba for forty years , but in that time they had lost none of their characteristic north country English habits and hospitality . Their house was as English as they could make it ; and the food we ate was good old Yorkshire duff . The Baluba tribe , one of the greatest in the Congo , live in a huge area extending north from Elisabethville . Since the Congo gained its independence the Baluba have acquired a reputation of being cruel and vicious people . They are in fact no more prone to violence than most other Bantu of Africa . But one or two stories that I heard about the Baluba while staying in the Katanga do perhaps give a good indication of the sort of traditional attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . The first of these stories was told me by Mr. Womersley who was present at the funeral of the last great Paramount Chief of the Luba , King Kabongo , in 1948 . In the olden days , Luban kings and chieftains were always put to death violently whilst there was still life in them . There was good reason for this ; for if the king died a natural death , the " King spirit " was thought to die with him . To the Baluba this would have been an unimaginable catastrophe for what then would happen to his successor ? If the " King spirit " was dead , it was thought inevitable that the power of the tribe would collapse . The death of the king was , to say the least of it , about the most unpleasant death imaginable . When it was seen that he could not live for long , his chief councillors were called upon to do the deed . They sneaked up on him at night , and having first stuffed his mouth with powdered wood both to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted his testicles until the last , breath of life had departed from him . Then came the burial ; and this I quote from the journal of the explorer Cameron written in 1875 . ( Cameron dedicated his journal to Queen Victoria , and it was probably out of deference to her that 77 he omitted any account of the king 's death , which I heard from Mr. Womersley . ) First , the chief 's head is severed to be preserved with the heads of other great chiefs from past generations . The next " proceeding is to divert the course of a stream , and in its bed to dig an enormous pit , the bottom of which is lined with women . At one end a woman is placed on her hands and knees , and upon her back the dead chief , covered with beads and other treasures , is seated , being supported on either side by one of his wives , while his second wife sits at his feet . The earth is then shovelled in on them , and all the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To her custom is more merciful than to her companions , and grants her the privilege of being killed before the huge grave is filled in . This being completed , a number of male slaves ? sometimes forty or fifty ? are slaughtered , and their blood poured over the grave ; after which the river is allowed to resume its course . Stories were rife that no fewer than a hundred women were buried alive with Bambarre , Kasongo 's father ; but let us hope that this may be an exaggeration . " Kasongo , to whom Cameron refers , was succeeded by his son Kabongo who did not die until 1948 . Familiar with the local custom , the Belgians took great care to see that Kabongo was allowed to die a natural death . He was , in fact , the first chief of this great tribe ever to do so . Furthermore they were determined to ensure there was no slaughter at his burial , and that he was not first decapitated according to custom . Though the police were alerted for Kabongo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be provocative . They therefore agreed to have just one representative present : and for this , knowing he was respected by the Luba , they chose Mr. Womersley . Now the entire manner of Kabongo 's death had infuriated a large number of the older members of the tribe . The " King spirit " was dead , and this was a calamity that surely spelt doom to the whole tribe . But many of them felt that if the funeral were traditional , the tribe might be reprieved , and they had made plans for a last minute take-over of the funeral proceedings . Word of this had leaked out , and when Mr. Womersley entered the hut where the dead king lay in state , he was suddenly besieged by dozens of women who beseeched him to come to their rescue . Womersley told the police what was going on , and extra precautions were 78 taken . The funeral went off without incident ; but who knows what took place in the bush once the security was relaxed ? Although things went peacefully in the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the time came to choose Kabongo 's successor , for many of the Baluba elders were in favour of the traditional methods of accession . These involved even more bloodshed than the death of the king , for by tradition , all the king 's sons would fight for the throne . When Europeans first settled in Baluba territory they found it a sparsely populated land . One of the reasons for this was that the country had not yet recovered from the slaughter that followed the death of the Luba king , Ilunga Kabale . Knowing what would follow their death , it was customary for Luba kings to drown most of their sons at birth , retaining only three or four of the strongest babies . Ilunga Kabale , however , a soft-hearted man , had let all sixteen of his sons live . Thus the inter-tribal battles that followed his death practically annihilated the entire tribe . In these battles , in which each son with his own followers fought the rest , there were certain rigid rules of war . When one of the princes saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honour forbade him to run away . Instead he allowed himself to be captured . Following his capture he was treated to a tremendous party that lasted for several days , during which he received full honours of the king himself , and even his victorious brother would pay him homage befitting a great chief . But he knew his time had come , and as a point of honour it was up to him to give the command for his own execution . Seated on a throne amid thousands of hushed warriors , he raised his hand as a signal to the executioners . Holding a twisted leather thong between them , the two executioners moved up close to the prince who now tilted his head backwards , baring his neck . The executioners then sawed through his neck with the thong until his head was completely severed . Such stories of wilful brutality among the Baluba greatly surprised me when I first heard them , for they seemed so out of keeping with their tremendously sensitive and delicate art style . When I arrived in the Congo I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also from the superb collection of woodcarving housed in the museum in Bulawayo , which I had called in to look at on my way through . This collection , the Codrington collection , had been captured from the kraal of a Baluba 79 chieftain named Kazembe during a punitive expedition in the last century . At that time a few outlying groups of Baluba lived on the Northern Rhodesian side of the frontier , though these later moved into the Congo . In the Codrington collection I had seen some very fine wooden caryatid stools , in the form of a woman holding the seat above her head ; and also a number of magnificent carved ceremonial paddles that used to be given to ferry-boatmen by the chiefs when they crossed rivers during journeys in outlying parts of their territory . It was carvings of this sort that had spread the fame of African sculpture throughout the world ; and now that I was in Lubaland it was these that I was after and I asked the Womersleys where the best places to search would be . 80 Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before answering , as though he did not quite know how to put the reply . But at last he spoke : " I am afraid you are going to be very disappointed . I know of not one single Baluba artist in the whole of this huge territory . In the olden days , of course , there were certainly some excellent artists and craftsmen . But I fear that since the coming of this civilisation of ours , all that sort of thing has gone . In fact , let me tell you the story of a thing that happened to me when I was running our mission at Kabongo . Kabongo was then the capital of the Luba king of the same name , so if there were any artists anywhere in Lubaland , that is where they would have been living . The great chiefs , the paramount especially , were always the ones who sponsored the arts , as you know . Well , there was one artist , an old man who is dead now , who used to live and work in a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me at the mission in a dreadful panic . Some people , he said , had tried to kill him , and he wanted me to protect him . The old chap was very distraught , and I thought he was exaggerating his story , so I quietened him down , and sent him back to his village . I could n't really see any reason why anyone would want to kill him . But not long after that , exactly the same thing happened again ; but this time he resolutely refused to leave the mission . He said he was lucky to have escaped as it was , and if he went back to his village he would surely be killed . So I gave him a bed , and over the next few days made some enquiries as to why anyone should want to kill him . What I heard was this . A number of young men in his and a neighbouring village , seeing him sitting outside his hut whittling away at his wood , began to wonder where this man got his knowledge and skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must be in league with the devil ; and those in league with the devil deserved to die . We kept him in the mission for several years , and he did some excellent work ... here , take a look at these " Mr. Womersley went over to a cupboard and took out a headrest , some combs , and several elaborate hatpins such as Luba men used to wear . They were beautifully carved in the old tribal style . " But as far as I know " , he went on , " he was the last Luba artist or craftsman in the country . " So it looked as though any search in Lubaland would be a waste of time . I stayed with the Womersleys for a day or two ; then , feeling very 81 depressed , once again got back on the road and headed north toward the land of the Bushongo where I hoped my luck would be better . En route to the Kasai Province , where the Bushongo live , I had an encounter that raised my hopes again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of Dibaya , and in the public rooms I noticed a few fine pieces of Bushongo carving , an elaborately decorated drum , a mask , and a figurine . I remarked on these to the Belgian hotelier , and seeing that I was interested , he beckoned me through to his private rooms in the rear . There he proceeded to show me his incredible collection of carvings . Scattered all over his sitting-room floor , on shelves down the narrow passages , under the beds , and even in the dirty-clothes basket beneath the bathroom basin , were carvings of every variety the Bushongo ever produced , many of them quite beautiful and some unique . Furthermore , he told me , he had about double this quantity stored away at his home in Belgium . The hotelier had worked on the railway that runs through the Kasai to Port Francqui on the Kasai river , and he had built up his collections over the many years he had spent wandering through the different villages in the bush . I was particularly struck by one carved figure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he would sell any of the carvings . He was a bit dubious , and asked me how much I would be prepared to pay . As I knew I could sell that one statue for practically anything I asked , I offered him the equivalent of fifty pounds . I thought the sum might be sufficiently large to shock him into selling it . But he merely looked at me and laughed . " I have already been offered twice that , " he said ; " but I would not even sell it for five hundred pounds ! " Just what his collection was worth I do not know . But he had a small fortune stacked away there , and he knew it . So I now drove , through Luluabourg , deep into the heart of the Bushongo country . Having as yet made no purchases in the Congo I was getting slightly worried about my finances . If the Bushongo offered nothing , I began to wonder whether I should be able to continue the safari right across to Leopoldville as planned . Not many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had a strange encounter that gave me a financial relief for a day or two if nothing else . I was driving down the road through a stretch of gigantic forest , when I saw ahead of me a cavalcade of people like an army of tiny ants against the enormous trees that towered on either side . As I came close I noticed that all the people , twenty or thirty of them , were running as fast as they could , most of them sweating profusely and clearly exhausted . In amongst them , almost dropping to their knees , were four stalwart , semi-naked men bearing upon their shoulders a very large ? but quite empty ? palanquin . For a moment I was bewildered by this strange sight . It seemed almost as though it were some tribal " rag " to raise money for the witch-doctor by seeing how far the porters could run with an empty palanquin in a given period of time . For there appeared to be no reason whatsoever for such unusual haste . Some way ahead of the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away on a bicycle with two young men prancing along on either side . Judging by his spectacles , pith-helmet , white shirt , and his corpulence , this man was obviously someone of considerable importance . And , equally obviously , he and his small 83 party were part and parcel of the sweating cavalcade that struggled along behind . Curious to find out who the cyclist was and what was going on , I drew into the side and waved him to stop . My excuse was that I wanted to take a picture of the palanquin . The gentleman introduced himself as Chief Albert , chief of an outlying district of the Bushongo tribe . He spoke French quite fluently , and as he appeared to be a friendly sort of person , I felt I could ask him , without causing embarrassment , why he travelled with both palanquin and bicycle . " S'il vous plait , monsieur , when I am on the road I ride my bicycle because it is faster and my men carry my palanquin . But when I am on the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I ride in my palanquin , and my men carry the bicycle . " This seemed very reasonable ; but Monsieur Albert was clearly quite oblivious to the discomfort he was causing everyone ! My curiosity having been satisfied I then took a photograph of the palanquin , and turned to thank the chief and say good-bye . But to my surprise I saw that he had wandered over to the Land Rover and was now peering in at the back looking with amazement at the contents . Suddenly he started clapping his hands and crying with delight . " Ah , monsieur ! Un lit de sangle ! Un lit de sangle ! Sensationnel ! " His eyes had alighted upon one of my camp beds . At the time I had two such beds in the car , one of which , with a wooden frame , was broken . It was this one that he now dragged from the car asking me pressingly if he could please buy it from me . For him , the camp bed , like his bicycle , would be the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very peak of grandeur when he went on tour round his district . I pointed out to him that it was broken ; but this made not the slightest difference . He wanted desperately to have it . The trouble was that I was not sure if I wanted to sell it . So in the hope that it would put him off I said gravely that it would be very expensive , and quoted the equivalent in francs of about five pounds . But to my astonishment Chief Albert immediately whipped out a bundle of notes and before I could have second thoughts , thrust it into my hands . Chief Albert was heading for his home village five or six miles down the road . So , thinking that I might give his exhausted entourage a rest , I gave him a lift in the Land Rover . I dropped the Chief without further excitement ; but as I was about to leave his compound he stopped me and told me to wait , as he wanted to give 84 me a present . And from his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later did I discover was a rare piece to find in the Congo at that time . So now I had arrived in the country of the Bushongo , one of the greatest tribes of central Africa with the most ancient and fascinating history , and once some of the most prolific woodcarvers of the Congo . Many African tribes have lengthy and complex mythologies and oral histories ; but perhaps those of the Bushongo are amongst the most interesting of all . The first European to whom they were divulged was an ethnographer named Emil Torday who visited their country soon after the turn of this century. * Their mythology is of particular interest in its similarity to Genesis , though at the time when Torday recorded it it would have been impossible for any knowledge of the Old Testament to have been imparted to the Bushongo people by Europeans . In Emil Torday 's words , it begins as follows : " In the beginning there was darkness and the earth was all covered with water ; in this chaos , Bumba , the Chembe ( God ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enormous size , and white of colour . One day he felt great pain in his belly and began to vomit ; first he vomited the sun , then the moon and then the stars ; thus there was light . Then , under the influence of the sun , the water began to evaporate , and sandbanks appeared on the surface ; but these sandbanks , like the waters from which they had risen , were devoid of all animal and vegetable life . Then Bumba vomited again , and originated the leopard , the crested eagle , the crocodile , the minnow , the tortoise , the lightning ( an animal like a black leopard with a fiery tail ) , the egret , a scarab and the goat . Then he vomited men innumerable , but only one of them was white like him , that was Loko Yima . " The animals he had created now bestirred themselves to people the earth : the egret vomited all the birds ( except the hawk ) ; the crocodile all the snakes and the iguana ; the goat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish , and the iguana all the hornless beasts . After that , one of the men , Nyonye N'Gana , vomited the white ants , but such was the effort he had to make that he died . Out of gratitude the white ants went to the bowels of the earth and fetched mould ; with this they covered the sterile sands and buried their creator in it . Chonganda vomited a plant from which all vegetable life sprang ; another man , Chedi Bumba , tried to create something new and vomited the hawk , but nothing else . " Thus was the world we know today created . " The mythology continues at some length , explaining how the lightning animal became troublesome and was banished to the sky ; how Man procured Fire from the trees it struck ; and how Bumba the God called together his best men , appointing tasks to each , making Loko Yima , the only white man , the supreme chief of humanity . Many other African mythologies are similar to this ; and in particular it is surprising how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many early European explorers were to benefit from this , their sudden presence in a village leading the inhabitants to believe instantly that God was come among them . Perhaps this is why we hear so little about mythology from presentday Africans . As Emil Torday sat listening to Bushongo elders recounting their tribal mythology and history , prompting and correcting each other if they so much as spoke a wrong word , he made a fascinating discovery that strongly suggests that , there may be far more validity in oral histories of African peoples than many believe . For he was able , with some certainty , to date the reign of a certain king who lived nearly three hundred years ago . At the time when he made the discovery , the tribal historians were recounting the great events of various reigns . When , in Torday 's words , " we came to the ninety-eighth chief , Bo Kama Bomanchala , they said that nothing remarkable happened during his reign , except that one day at noon the sun went out , and there was absolute darkness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate . " When I heard this I lost all self-control ; " he wrote " I jumped up and wanted to do something desperate ; the elders thought I had been stung by a scorpion ! It was only months later that . . . the date of the eclipse became known to me ; but I may just as well mention that there was no doubt left that it was the 30 March , 1680 , when there was 86 a total eclipse of the sun , passing exactly over Bushongo , the conjunction being at 10.33 , Greenwich time , which makes in our longitude , 11.58 , two minutes before noon ! There was no possibility of confusion with another eclipse , because this was the only one visible in the region during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . " The list of Bushongo kings , numbering one hundred and twenty names , with their full titles , takes a tribal historian over forty minutes to recite ; and they date back probably eight hundred years to the time of their most famous mortal ancestor , Woto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely one of the most remarkable men that Africa has produced ? was the ninety-fourth ruler of the Bushongo , Shamba Bolongongo , who reigned about A.D. 1600 . Shamba was the Confucius of the Bushongo , the ultimate in wisdom and knowledge , and creator of parables and epigrams that are quoted to this day . " A man had two dogs , " so Shamba said , " and every day when he had finished his meal he divided the remains into two equal shares and gave them to his pets . One day he had a bone so big that he could not break it . Well , let them gnaw it together , ' he said and threw the bone to his dogs . They both went , for the bone growling furiously , and soon began to fight over it so viciously that both dogs died from their wounds . Only then did the man see his mistake . Let every dog have his bone , and every woman her husband , and there will be peace in the village . " And again : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no strength . But day by day its sweetness decreases and the liquor becomes stronger , until at last the wine becomes potent and harsh and devoid of all sweetness . Man is like a palm-wine : sweet youth lacks wisdom , wise old age lacks sweetness of character . " Shamba was a good man . He banned warfare except for selfdefence , and laid down laws by which his people should live . Many Bushongo attribute the seventeen " commandments " that are taught to boys in their initiation school to Shamba Bolongongo . These include such commandments as " To avoid obscene language " ; " Not . to gamble " ; " Not to kill , even in war , but to defend yourself with valour " ; " To respect other people 's wives " ; " To respect women 's modesty " ; and " If your father 's clothes are in disorder , tell him ; if your mother 's , leave it to your sister to do so ; you must not make your mother blush . " The great Shamba travelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas to his people . He introduced the art of weaving , and taught people to make soft raffia clothing that superseded the ancient bark-cloth . He encouraged arts and crafts in every form : embroidery , metal-working , and above all , wood-carving . Strangely the Bushongo , great craftsmen though they are , do not make any pottery . It is thought that , having become renowned far and wide as woodcarvers , some King forbade them to make pottery lest it detracted from their prowess with wood . ( The Bushongo use pots ; but all are purchased from neighbouring tribes . ) Wood , however , sufficed to provide them with all they needed in the way of boxes , bowls , spoons , and the beautiful cups for which they have become famous . These were the sort of things I was hoping to purchase when I arrived in their country . I drove first of all not to the administrative centre of the Bushongo country , but to their tribal capital , the Mushenge , a few miles further to the north . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was where most of the Bushongo craftsmen lived . He had advised me also to try to arrange an audience with the present King whom he felt would be able to help me obtain the sort of things I wanted . There was nowhere for me to stay at the Mushenge , so when I arrived I pitched my tent in a copse of giant trees on the edge of the village . Almost as soon as I started to erect the tent I was surrounded by one of the most unruly gatherings of young Africans that I have ever come across . If the Bushongo are artistic in some respects , they are anything but musical . And the gang of onlookers that came to peer at everything I did would soon have driven me to distraction with their raucous cackling and jabbering had not an old man ( obviously of the polite Shamba Bolongongo school ) arrived on the scene to rebuke them fiercely and send them home with a barrage of insults and curses for being so rude to a stranger . By a lucky chance I discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swahili . The latter was rare among the Bushongo ? in fact he was the only man in the Mushenge whom I heard speaking it ? but it was extremely useful ; for it welded an immediate link between us of which he was inordinately proud , and he remained with me wherever I went over the next few days , looking upon it as a great privilege to interpret for me . With the old man 's help I was able to arrange to see the King the day after I arrived . I had met numerous tribal chiefs before , in East Africa , but all these had either been such small chiefs as to be unimpressive , or the products of European schools , and thus lacking any of the primitive splendour that I had always associated with powerful tribal overlords . The Bushongo had been one of the last tribes of the Congo who had submitted to European rule , and being immensely proud of their great past , they had continued to live , even into the nineteen-fifties , in the same traditional way as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribal fashion , and the Mushenge , although many of its houses were dilapidated , was still pervaded with a rich atmosphere of power and pomp . Thus , when I came to visit the King , I did so with some awe and trepidation . Early in the morning a group of functionaries from the King 's palace came down to my tent with my old man to conduct me to the audience chamber . My camp was some way from the palace , necessitating a long walk through the village , down broad streets , past 89 the ornate court-house with its woven cane walls and finely carved verandah posts , and into the palace itself . This consisted of a maze of courtyards , one leading into the next through narrow doors , surrounded by the thatched houses of the King 's wives , concubines and courtiers . We came at last to a small gatehouse where I then had to wait for almost an hour with two of the functionaries who spoke not a word throughout the whole period . Suddenly , as we sat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the gatehouse like a queen . Those with me bowed low , and clapped their hands in obeisance to her ; and I was told by my old man that this was one of the royal sisters , a woman of great importance in the land , indeed almost a queen . It seemed that she had wished to talk to the King at short notice , and that it was on her account that we had to wait so long , for now almost immediately we were shown through yet another yard into a dingy little hut which I could not at first believe was the audience chamber . Here I was asked to take a seat ; and here we waited for another twenty minutes . Then suddenly there was a commotion outside , and the courtiers in attendance backed obsequiously towards the walls . And with as much grace as he could muster Bopey Mobinj III , Nyimi of the Bushongo , Lukengo of Bakuba , Chembe Kunji , the Lord 's own Lieutenant , entered the room and slid deftly into a huge and very rickety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stature who weighed nearly twenty-one stone . Upon his head he wore a conical cap held in place by carved wooden pins . His legs , from ankle to knee , were enclosed in huge coils of solid brass . His vast stomach protruded and from well below his navel hung an impressively voluminous kilt with a leopard-skin sporran . The " throne " upon which he now sat was of European make , very cheap , and falling to pieces . Above it , on the wall , hung a gaudy painting , from Port Said or Cairo , and doubtless given to him by a European visitor , of an Arab Sheik sitting upon a camel far out in the desert , beneath a virulent blue sky . Suddenly , face to face with this grotesque mixture of primitive splendour and ersatz junk my vision of the powerful Majesty fell to pieces . Poor Bopey Mobinj . Though there were things about him and his court , that were the epitome of power and greatness , in the last resort he was a great big figure of fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death over thousands , who were considered so sacred that their feet might never be allowed to touch the ground ( God help the slaves who would have had to carry Bopey Mobinj ! ) , descendant of the fabled Shamba Bolongongo , son of warriors feared throughout the Congo ? he , the Nyimi of the all-powerful Bushongo , became in an instant no more than a gross shadow , a man deceived by modernity , a mere puppet , whose every act was manipulated by a young Belgian sitting a few miles off in an airconditioned office . Suddenly I felt desperately sorry for him . Here before me was an elderly man who had known the great days of his tribe before the coming of the white man ; but the world of his ancestors had been torn to shreds by the " nouveau " ways of foreigners , and as surely as darkness follows the setting of the sun , when Bopey Mobinj died the spirit of the Bushongo would depart from this world forever . Through my interpreter I now asked the Nyimi if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The poor old King hardly moved as he spoke , and on his face there was an expression of utter despondency . Though I learned later that he got along well with his European masters , and did all he could to encourage his people to accept European teaching and to go to school , I could not escape the feeling that he was distressed by what , he now had to tell me . Today , he said , the only place in which I could buy Bushongo works of art was in the Belgian Government crafts centre a few miles away in Mweka . That is where I should have gone . Was there nothing in the Mushenge , I asked , that I might be able to purchase ? " The craftsmen live in the Mushenge , certainly , " he replied ; " but they send all their work to Mweka as they are not allowed to sell it direct to Europeans in case they ask unfair prices . " But then the old King turned to a courtier and muttered something I did not understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a special concession as I was interested in the Bushongo crafts , and sell me one or two . things from his private collection . And a minute or two later the courtier to whom he had spoken arrived bearing a bundle of woven raffia cloth and a beautifully made knife . The knife was about sixteen inches long with an unusual leafshaped blade called by the Bushongo an " ikula " . In the olden days no Bushongo would have been seen without such a knife hanging behind his right hip , and some of the older people can still be seen wearing them even now . Though it is only meant for show , on dark 91 nights the ikula has to be replaced by a wooden replica so as to avoid brawls or accidents . Knives of various types feature prominently in Bushongo culture . The very name of the tribe is taken from a vicious weapon ? a four-bladed throwing knife ? that was known to fearful neighbours as the " shongo " or " lightning " ? hence the Bushongo , the " People of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago in Shamba Bolongongo 's reign , the shongo was banned along with shields and bows and arrows , and the only weapon of war then allowed to the Bushongo was a knife known as the " ilondo " . It was now that I discovered that it was an ilondo that Chief Albert had given me , and that it must be a weapon of considerable antiquity . In Shamba Bolongongo 's day no one was allowed to wear the ilondo in peace-time ; and when it was transported from place to place it had , by law , to be wrapped carefully in cloth ? such was the desire of the mighty Bushongo in ancient times to avoid any act of aggression . It , is astonishing that 92 despite their peace-loving nature they held power over such a wide area . But so great were the reprisals that would follow any act of aggression upon one of their people , that it was sufficient , so they say , for a Bushongo merely to state his tribe when travelling in a foreign territory , for people to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bopey Mobinj now showed me were squares of raffia embroidered like velvet with a soft pile . Embroidery of this type , which is used on dance dresses to this day , once again had its origins in Shamba Bolongongo 's time . He himself had brought the art from further west in the Congo . But embroidery had become all the rage when the great King had chosen as one of his wives the most proficient needlewoman in the Mushenge . Later I saw several embroideresses in the village sitting , as at a sewing-bee , beneath the eaves of their houses , chatting whilst they worked . The raffia that they used , red , black , and yellow , had been dyed in natural vegetable dyes , and the traditional designs that they worked , 93 often very beautiful , all had names that related to famous ancestors such as Woto , or other familiar objects like the " wild pine-apple " and the " tortoise " . I asked Bopey Mobinj the price of the articles we were looking at . Without hesitation he quoted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three pounds for the knife . The knife was an antique and the price seemed reasonable ; but the squares were modern and I felt certain he was guilty of overcharging . Later my suspicions were confirmed , but although in retrospect I am sure he expected me to bargain with him , for some reason I felt that to enter into the common practice of haggling , with a King , was somewhat undignified . So I took the easy way out and purchased just one square of embroidery , and the knife , to keep for myself as mementoes of the visit . As we were completing the transaction a messenger came to the door to tell the King that one of his daughters was sick . The poor old man became very perturbed , and with scarcely another glance in my direction he was helped from his chair , and the last , I saw of him was as he squeezed his vast frame through the doorway and waddled urgently off across the palace yard to visit his ill child . That was before the Congo became independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what became of Bopey Mobinj and his powerful but peace-loving people . In all probability the disruptive influences of " freedom " have shattered the remains of his proud empire more convulsively than they have disrupted the less proud , more primitive world of the neighbouring riff-raff . When Emil Torday first came into Bushongo territory half a century ago he described a village thus : " Stepping out of a lovely grove of palm trees we faced a long street , at least thirty feet wide , as straight as an arrow . It was bordered by oblong huts , each standing alone at an equal distance from its neighbours ; they were all the same shape and differed only in their walls , which were made of mat work ornamented with beautiful designs in black ; their conventional patterns varied from house to house . The houses were as spick and span as if they had just been finished ; the road was swept clean . Though the day was still hot the village was as busy as a hive . Everybody was working , the looms of weavers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shields in the middle of the street men were carving , making mats or baskets , and in front of their houses women were 94 engaged in embroidery . The very children were bent on some task , some working the smith 's bellows , others combing the raffia for the weavers , or making themselves generally useful . The whole place was a picture of peaceful activity . " Fifty years later the description still fitted the Mushenge of the Bushongo well , with the exception that the quality of the housing was now poor in comparison to the beautifully ornate buildings of ancient , times . Weavers , needleworkers , smiths and carvers worked peacefully away at their tasks . But today their products were being made less and less for their own use and more and more for sale to tourists . I spent a day or two in the Mushenge just to watch these craftsmen at work ? to see , for instance , how they prepared the raffia fronds for weaving by pounding them in troughs of water , then spreading them over the roof-tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine and soft as cotton . I was interested , too , to see some of the traditional techniques of the woodcarvers ? how they darkened light wooden objects by burying them in a bog , and how they " sand-papered " them with a certain oily leaf covered in 95 spines like the rough skin of a shark . I had once had a bitter argument with one of my American customers who described in a piece of advertising , how the " primitive tribal Wakambas of Kenya smoothed their carvings with leaves like sand-paper gathered from the forests . " This , of course , was utter bunkum about the Wakamba , who used nothing but the best English glass-paper ; but I saw now where he had got the idea . When I left the Mushenge I went directly to Mweka to visit the Belgian Administrator and make arrangements to purchase a consignment of goods for the United States . Most of the objects on sale were copies of traditional work ? various initiation masks , and masks of so-called " secret " societies either carved in wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with beads and cowrie shells ; half-moon shaped cosmetic boxes to hold powdered red camm-wood for rubbing on the body ; cups and bowls of various designs ; and effigies of past kings , each one holding his traditional emblems of office ? such as Shamba Bolongongo whose emblem was the " Lela " board , a common game in Africa . The work was depressingly clumsy and bad compared with original pieces I had seen in the hotel and museums ; and the prices , fixed by the cooperative who ran the shop , were exorbitant . So I spent a day or two going carefully through the stocks selecting the best I could find and packing them into crates scrounged from a local merchant in Mweka . These crates I then stacked into the back of the Land Rover to take them to a shipping agent in the nearest Congo river port , Port Francqui , from there to be shipped to New York . Whilst in Mweka packing up my purchases I learnt that there would be little point in dallying in the country of the Bapende and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Southern Congo through which I would now be passing on my way to Leopoldville . A Belgian ethnographer , Dr. Maesens , had recently spent two years wandering about their country making collections for the Tervuren museum . During those two years he had found some superb pieces of traditional work . However , not only had he had the time to search , but also the authority of the Belgian government behind him , and the wherewithal to pay for interpreters and other money-consuming adjuncts necessary for a successful expedition . Although it seemed from his experience that the traditional arts of the south had not entirely disappeared , it was 96 clear that any trip that I might make would inevitably be uneconomical . I therefore decided , when I left Mweka and the Mushenge , to drive straight across to Leopoldville , a dreadful journey of over 500 miles along bone-shaking roads , through the dull rolling grass plains of the Southern Congo . The journey was without incident , except for the occasion when I was accused of being a cannibal . The night after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote mission station a little way off the road . The Congolese roads were not well signposted , and I was none too clear where I should turn off . It was already growing dark , so seeing an African bicycling down the road , I stopped to ask him the way . To my surprise he took one look at me , jumped on to his bicycle , and pedalled off as fast as he could in the opposite direction . A bit odd , I thought ; but no matter . . . A few miles further on I came into a small village . There were many people around , by the roadside and outside their huts . I drew up , got out , and was going over to the nearest group when with a shout and a scream every single man jack in that village disappeared into the bush . Just one little three-year-old boy stayed behind , who though he sucked his finger and gazed at me benignly , was too small to help . There was nothing for it but to try again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an oil-nut processing factory . Lights were on , and boilers were burning , so guessing there was a night shift at work I drove up . There was indeed a night shift ; about a dozen Africans in overalls clustered round a boiler . I hailed them . They looked at me . They looked again . And . . . oh no ! ... they took to their heels and ran . I was getting very frustrated and angry by then . The whole business was totally inexplicable and utterly ridiculous . I eventually found the mission station , though it was very late , and when I arrived I asked the missionary if he could throw any light on the extraordinary goings-on . For a moment he looked bewildered ; then suddenly he smiled . " Which sort car you have , Monsieur Read ? " he asked in his broken English . " A long wheel-base Land Rover . " " Ah ! that is it , that is it ! " he laughed . " Let me explain ! This is very funny . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? who came through here in his Land Rover . He was making portraits , and in the back of his Land Rover he had a bust of an African . // Some Africans saw his car , saw the likeness of their people , and the word went all across the country that the gentleman was coming to capture Africans , cut them up , and sell them as tinned meat . And you , monsieur ! You are just another cannibal in a Land Rover ! " Though I had done a fair amount of business in the southern Congo , I was somewhat disappointed in the quantity and quality of the work I had found . The country had been scoured by local collectors , from Emil Torday ( who collected most of the superb Congolese material in the British Museum ) , to such people as my hotelier friend in Dibaya . The old , beautiful , and really valuable pieces were not being replaced , and only in isolated regions were the native craftsmen interested in producing commercial carvings . // A Forest of Canoes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Leopoldville or its twin city across the Congo , Brazzaville . After several weeks in the bush it would no doubt have been pleasant to while away a few hazy evenings in the chi-chi continental nightclubs of Africa 's " petite Bruxelles " , or loll back idly sipping Pernod under the gay umbrellas of Brazzaville 's " bistros " . But these two cities were among the most expensive in Africa and business had not been sufficiently good to allow for such luxuries . Nevertheless I was eventually compelled to remain there for nearly three weeks , as space was not immediately available on any of the river steamers that plied up the Congo river to Stanleyville . So during this enforced stay I endeavoured to do what business I could . The big cities of Africa are never the best places to buy anything that has come originally from the hands of village craftsmen far out in the bush . Having passed through numerous middlemen en route the prices of the goods are astronomical by the time they reach the gold-lined boulevards of the capital . In Leopoldville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had visited . For some strange reason , despite the latent ability of Congolese craftsmen to create a curio industry of their own , almost all the goods on sale in Leopoldville had either come originally from Nigeria , or been produced by Wakamba carvers in Kenya . And as the hucksters who did the rounds in the hotels and bars were some of the sharpest businessmen in Africa ? Hausa traders from the far distant " Soudan " ? the prices of most things were far beyond my limits . There were , however , a few exceptions to this . In a missionary establishment in Brazzaville I unearthed two or three boxes of softwood carvings by Bakongo craftsmen making their first tentative exploration of the tourist market . And from the pavements of both Brazzaville and Leopoldville I was able to purchase a large number 99 of locally produced African paintings at the favourable price of two shillings each . The painting business in this part of Africa had originated in an art school run by a bearded Frenchman named Pierre Lods . Like Laurent Moonens in Elisabethville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find his first few pupils , had unleashed an astonishing explosion of artistic talent . Many of his pupils were artists of the highest order ; but most of them were older than their counterparts in Elisabethville , and they had been quick to discover the commercial value of their work . Though they were able to sell their own paintings at high prices , they had , early on , imparted their techniques and ideas to friends and neighbours at home , who had then proceeded to flood the pavements with a hailstorm of cheap reproductions . These street paintings , executed on coloured paper in a spiky style , humming with life and movement , were immediate best-sellers among Europeans . For me they were a godsend , as the mark-up I was able to put on them was more than sufficient to cover my expenses in the twin cities of the Congo . Nevertheless I was thankful when the time came to load the Land Rover on to the river-boat and head once again into the wilder regions of the great Congo forests . Stanleyville lies a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamer . Upstream from Leopoldville the river first passes through open savannah ; but soon the grasslands recede and the only sight that meets the eye is the oppressive wall of blue-green jungle that surges down to the water 's edge , struggling for light and air . The Congo is a sombre river , deeply mysterious and quiet . When Henry Morton Stanley first paddled down it , the natural savagery of the forests was equalled only by the savagery of the natives he encountered . Seventy years later the people may have been at peace ; but on the river itself , nature was still untamed . As we fought our way upstream against the current it seemed that we did so only by the grace of the gods of the forest ; that at any moment a clap of thunder and a flash of lightning might signal the end of the truce , and the matted , twisted jungles would bear down on us from all sides and crush us into oblivion . It was powerful and frightening , yet the river was intensely beautiful . Brightly coloured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the trees on the banks monkeys chattered as they crashed , unseen , from branch to branch . As the sun set each night it did so with a fierce intensity , deep red and 100 purple , sharpening the outline of the forest giants , turning the rippling water into pools of blood and fire . Deep in the undergrowth the bullfrogs roared their greeting as the night fell . The cicadas , whose incessant chirruping had stirred the air throughout the day , fell quiet , hushed by the falling darkness . The powerful searchlight of our boat came on , and all through the night swept back and forth across the wall of green , fearful of the spirit of the jungle . As though the power of Africa alone was not enough , the Congo river was threatened by another encroaching peril . Three years before my journey , an American missionary in some distant station up a remote backwater had brought from the United States a sprig of pretty blue water-hyacinth for his wife 's water-garden . In three years , under the tropical sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed a menace of colossal magnitude to the Congo . Washed downstream it had lodged beneath every root and branch on the myriad islands and miles of bank , there to multiply and send its offspring floating on towards the sea . Even at that time , so soon after its introduction , it was estimated that it would cost ? 4,000,000 to clear it , if indeed it could ever be destroyed . In fact it was not destroyed and never will be . Instead , it has spread to other rivers . Its seeds , carried by birds and the wind across the 101 narrow watersheds in the centre of the continent , have found their way to the Zambezi and the Nile . And today it still costs hundreds of thousands of pounds a year to keep these three great waterways clear of the weed and open to navigation . As we moved upstream we passed many villages large and small . Sometimes we could see a village far ahead , marked by a pillar of dense smoke that rose above the forest from the chimney of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wh0000p " our sirens would burst on the still air , and the foreshore would thicken with a mottled pattern of faces , black and white , come down to collect their weekly mail , or unload a cargo of beans and flour . Sometimes men and girls on the banks would hail us and perform a cheerful erotic dance for our pleasure until we passed on out of sight ; and sometimes fleets of canoes , black men paddling furiously , would emerge from the jungles and fight their way alongside our boat . Many of these carried traders who came on board with bundles of dried crocodile meat to sell to meat-hungry townsmen upstream . In one of these fleets of canoes there was a white man . He was big and burly , and at first I took him to be a forester . But when he came on board I found he was a missionary , called John Carrington . He had made a name for himself , not as a Baptist preacher , but a musicologist and linguist whose special study was the drum language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drum language was rapidly falling into disuse among young Africans , and John Carrington , himself an expert , was worried that it would soon die out altogether . So with the backing of tribal elders this English missionary held classes every week at which he himself taught the younger generation the secrets of the " talking drum " . There was another use to which John Carrington put his knowledge of the drum language . If , when preaching a sermon , he noticed his congregation dropping off , he would suddenly , without warning , switch to the language of the drums , beating it out on the front of the pulpit . This never failed to captivate his startled congregation with the result that people from all over the jungle flocked to church , if only to hear him preaching in the drum language . John was a great help to me when we reached Stanleyville , and told me of a number of places in the neighbourhood where I might be able to do some good business . One of the first places he suggested I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 102 banks of the Lindi river north of Stanleyville . Here , he told me , a certain tribe called the Bamanga had , since time immemorial , made chairs of an interesting design , from the sides of old disused canoes . So as soon as the car was unloaded from the boat , I drove north , up a red laterite road that ran for most of the way along the jungle-clad banks of the Lindi . The chair-makers of Bengamisa , like the carvers of the Bushongo , had been organised into a co-operative by the Belgian Administration , and they worked in a large shed near the centre of the village . It was late evening when I arrived , and the craftsmen were about to go home ; but as soon as they saw that I was interested in doing business they stayed for a while to show me the chairs . The design of the Bengamisa chairs must be unique ; they are like solid wooden deck-chairs made of two boards , one of which is slotted through the other . They are not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this was my only chance to get any , I decided to lay in as large a stock as possible . The price of the chairs had been fixed by the co-operative at ? 2 each so no time had to be wasted over the somewhat tedious business of bargaining . I asked the head craftsman how many chairs he had in stock . He did not know off-hand , so we went into the store to count them . There were forty-eight . Right , I said . I would have the lot . And I brought out a thick bundle of Congo francs , counted out the equivalent of 103 ? 96 and spread it out across a table , saying that I would be back in the morning to pack up the chairs . The effect on the craftsmen was electric . They were speechless with astonishment . Such a thing as this had never before happened in the whole history of the country . Leaving them gaping with amazement I said good-night and went on my way . I was spending that night in a mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasant drive , for the road runs for most of the way along the steep banks that drop away to the river . This was the time of day ? when the air was still and the world was at peace ? when the drums began to " talk " , and as I drove I listened to their familiar sounds . Up and down the river their rhythmic beating echoed . . . te dum , te dum , te te dum , dum dum dum ... one drum answering the other , relaying the message from village to village . It took only twenty minutes to reach the mission station where I found none of the missionaries at home . A servant told me that the white men were out working in neighbouring villages and would be gone another hour yet . So whilst I waited I went for a stroll down to the river 's edge . It was quiet and beautiful . The Lindi river , a little known tributary several times wider than the Thames , flowed swiftly by , eddying in whirlpools as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its strength to the surging mother Congo . The bullfrogs were already beginning to croak in the undergrowth , and now and again a fish rose from the water with a lethargic plop sending concentric rings scurrying across the surface that were quickly distorted and lost in the surging flow . Suddenly a pale blue heron came gliding downstream low over the water , making idle swoops at shadowy forms beneath the water , and on the far bank a fisheagle , changing its tree-top perch every few minutes , kept a watchful eye on its hunting grounds below . The peace was broken by a sound of shouting , and the muffled splash of paddles . Several canoes , from upstream and down , emerged from the overhanging jungles and broke out across the current to the point where I was sitting . When I saw them first , I noticed nothing strange . But suddenly I was alarmed , for all the occupants were carrying spears , enormous spears , with blades two feet long and wider than a hand . Some also carried huge sickles , big as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , shouting . Casually , not wanting to show my fear , I got up 104 and began to stroll back up the path towards the mission . But there , ahead of me , and down the path along by the river my way was blocked by ten or twelve men , each with one of these enormous sickles or spears . I had never seen spears like these . One thrust would have opened a six-inch wound . One swipe of the sickle would have decapitated an ox . Surrounded by these frightening warriors , I stopped and awaited their approach . To my relief they were , all of them , smiling broadly , and their shouts were shouts of greeting , not of anger . They came straight up to me and spoke to me in Swahili . The Bwana wants to buy the native things ? Would the Bwana like to buy our spears ? Would the Bwana give me ten shillings for a sickle ? How many does the Bwana want ? I looked at them incredulous . How on earth did they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived only five minutes before and had not mentioned my business to the servant I had seen , or anyone else . But then it occurred to me . The drums that I had heard as I drove from Bengamisa had been spreading the word throughout the land ? " . . . the white man . . . spirit of the forest ... come to buy .. . to buy the old old things . " Their spears were not spears of war , but an ancient form of money which , even today , are used for payment of bride-price . A man might give his daughter 's hand in marriage for a dozen goats , some beer , a handful of cash and twenty spears . The sickles are used for bride-price , too ; but in the olden days they were vicious and effective weapons of war . These things were in demand in the United States both for small museums , and for people who had visited Africa ? and perhaps others who had not ? to hang on their walls as trophies , and augment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of two and a half wives , and half a wife in sickles . The drums that had heralded my arrival in Bengamisa are remarkable instruments . Though they are usually referred to as drums , it would be more correct to call them " gongs " or idiophones , for they have no membrane . They are made in sizes varying from a few inches to ten or twelve feet long ? sometimes in the form of stylised antelopes ? from logs or tree trunks . Along the top of the tree trunk a small slit about two inches wide is cut , and through this the body of the trunk is hollowed out . When the work of hollowing is nearly done , the gong is then tuned to two tones . This is done by making one side of the cavity larger than the other , with a small ridge between them . The parts of the gong in the native language have 105 names . The ridge that divides the two cavities is the " backbone " ; the small cavity is the " female " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . By beating the two lips on either side of the slit , the two tones are obtained . In this part of Africa ( though not everywhere ) the method of sending a message is not , as one might expect , like morse code ? high high low equalling dot dot dash ? but is a language of its own . This language used on the gongs , which can also be spoken if required , is a totally different language to that used in normal conversation . Like most African languages it is " tonal " , the voice rising and falling on different syllables ? " nalibogo " ( a plantain ) for instance is " low low high low " ? and message sending is based on this principle . Obviously many words have the same tonal variation , for instance " mzungu " and " Bwana " would both be " high low " . This makes the drum language very complicated , as practically everything has to be described and explained . As an example , a certain European nurse was given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usungu lata kumbu , useka samalu , awetshi ambutshimba nyombo " , meaning " Mama diseases , hen , white person tearing down fences referring to the first colonisers who had torn down barriers and made peace among the tribes , she-goat , doctor shaking his gourd of charms . " As any white nurse or woman doctor would sound the same , she also had other , more personal names that she was never told ! Such names are usually abbreviated , but if the man at the receiving end is a dimwit , there is a full explanation at hand if necessary . Sometimes the meaning is obvious from the context . The words for " fiancee " and " rubbish pit " are the same : the phrase " alambaka boili " means both " he watched the river bank " and " he 106 boiled his mother-in-law " , but presumably it is fairly obvious which is intended . The missionaries with whom I stayed in Bengamisa were an elderly English couple . Like the Womersleys with whom I had stayed in Kamina , they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Womersleys , their house and their mode of life was more English than can be found in England . It seemed strangely incongruous to sit sipping cups of tea listening to the old man as he related stories from their early days in Africa . On their first two tours he and his wife had reached their mission by what was then the easiest route , up the Nile to Juba , and overland through Equatoria . The journey used to take them five months , and involved hazardous treks through country inhabited by cannibals . On one of these journeys the missionary had got to know a certain famous Azande chieftain who sounded a charming character . If any of his subjects sneezed in his presence , they were immediately put to death . There was the occasion , too , when the same chieftain held a great party which lasted several days , and to which chiefs of neighbouring tribes were invited . With a macabre sense of humour , at the climax of the party , the chief announced to his bloated visitors the names of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief was not all evil ; he never harmed the missionaries . The following day I returned to Bengamisa to pack the spears and chairs for shipment to the U.S.A. They were some of the bulkiest items I had had to deal with on this safari , and they presented some problems . Before leaving Stanleyville I had acquired several crates which now had to be broken down and rebuilt around the goods ; but even so I eventually had to make two further journeys into the city as I neither had sufficient crates , nor could I transport all the chairs in one load . My routine here was the same as usual . I put the boxes in the hands of a shipping agent in Stanleyville who got them on their way , by devious methods of transport , to their ultimate destination : On items such as these I usually marked up about 100 per cent profit . I made additional charges for packing materials and , in this case , transport from Bengamisa to Stanleyville ; but all other freight charges were paid by Al and Nat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate retail prices were in New York ; but when duty had been paid , and allowing for a high retail profit margin my guess is that most goods sold for eight to ten times their original cost . 107 When I had despatched the spears and chairs there was one other journey I wanted to make while in the Bamanga area . When we had arrived at Stanleyville on the river steamer , John Carrington had taken me to a fishermen 's village near the city where I had been fascinated by the canoes used by these Congo tribesmen , and I much wanted to see how they were constructed . When Stanley had passed this way on his famous journey of exploration , he too had been struck by the canoes in this area , and in particular , by their remarkable size . Some , belonging to the Mwana Ntaba , that he had measured , were over eighty-five feet long . But when he encountered the warriors of the middle Congo he noted that " their canoes were much larger than those of the Mwana Ntaba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorable river battle thus : " A monster canoe leads the way , with two rows of upstanding paddlers , forty men on a side , their bodies bending and swaying in unison as with a swelling barbarous chorus they drive her down towards us . In the bow , standing on what appears to be a platform , are ten prime young warriors , their heads gay with feathers ; at the stern eight men , with long paddles whose tops are decorated with ivory balls , guide the monster vessel ; and dancing up and down from stem to stern are ten men , who appear to be chiefs . " A dugout canoe carrying a hundred and eight people ! Even allowing for Stanley 's tendency to exaggerate , these canoes were certainly vast , and so they are to this day . There are two riverain tribes near Stanleyville famous for their canoes and canoemanship : the Baena fishermen who work up and down the rapids below the Stanley Falls ; and the Lokele . Many of the Lokele tribesmen live on their canoes permanently , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from their homeland for months at a time , on expeditions that take them hundreds of miles downstream . Their huge canoes are built by the same tribe ? the Bamanga ? who make the Bengamisa chairs , and it was the canoe-builders whom I now set out to visit . The canoe-makers ' village lay about ten miles into the forest off the road between Bengamisa and Yangambi . Trekking through these giant Congo forests was a fascinating experience . Beneath the massive trees where the sun never penetrated , the air was cool and damp . The path underfoot , a carpet of rotting humus , was soft and easy going . Orchids hung from the trees , and a few large butterflies flitted through the undergrowth ; apart from that nothing stirred . My 108 guide and I moved fast along the forest paths , and after two or three hours could hear the distant muffled sounds of chopping , floating through the forest . Ahead of me the guide paused for a moment and told me he thought we ought to let them know we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I wondered how he would do this . If he called to them his words would be lost in the heavy , dank atmosphere , but so far as I could see there was no other way to tell them . Suddenly he broke into a startling song . In a high tenor voice he shouted as loud as he could , and I suddenly realised what he was doing . He was shouting the music of the gongs . . . ya oo , 00 0o ya oo , ya oo . . . his voice echoed through the trees . And from the far distance , barely audible , came the reply . " White man . . . spirit of the forest . . . welcome , welcome ... come to the big tree . " We moved on , and guided by the sound of the axes , pushed our way through the undergrowth to where a canoe was being built . The half-made canoe we saw , though not one of the largest , was big . It was about sixty feet long , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been felled . Canoe-building is a family affair ; the work being done by a man , his wife , and children . The lapse of time between " laying the keel " and launching is three years , and the sequence of events is this : far out in the depths of the forest , many miles from the nearest water , a tree is chosen and felled . There it is left to lie for two years to allow the sap-wood to rot away and the heart-wood to mature . At the beginning of the third year work begins . First the tree is cut to length , then it is levelled off along the top , and the external shape of the canoe is formed . This alone may take several months . When it begins to take shape the task of hollowing out the inside then begins . This is not as simple as one might think . Consider , for a moment , the conditions . The jungle is wet and rain is frequent . If one blindly hacks out the inside anyhow , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before work can begin it will be necessary to bale out hundreds of gallons of water . It is therefore hewn out in sections about two feet long with watertight bulkheads between them . In this way the piece being worked on can be baled out in a matter of minutes . Work goes on slowly for several more months until the time comes to chop away the bulkheads , leaving a huge finished canoe lying many miles out in the forest . While work is in progress , the father spends much of his time visiting Lokele traders , looking for a buyer . He may be lucky , and 109 find someone who wants a new canoe that year . If not , his canoe will lie in the forest until the next season , filled with water to prevent it cracking . A large canoe costs about seventy pounds , unlaunched . Potential buyers come to look at it whilst it is still being made , and the price is fixed before it is finished . Now comes the business of launching it , and getting it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congo river ) . Before the canoe is finished 110 a track has been cleared through the forest , across which , at intervals of six or seven feet , small lengths of timber have been laid to act as a slipway . These are put in position long before the launching to allow time for them to grow slimy and slippery with decay . At one end of the canoe , on the platform that forms the prow , a hole has been cut , through which the towing " rope " is fixed . The rope is a carefully chosen liana ; this , so they say , being preferable to European rope as it does not cut their hands . There is an unwritten law amongst the Bamanga that they help each other at the launching , so sixty or seventy villagers are now called upon , and the monster canoe is hauled to the water . For two or three days the jungle echoes to the sounds of labour , as the builder urges his men on ; " Balimatakalimatololo ... HOO . . . Kimbumimbo ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . HOO . . . " At last the stream is reached , and the canoe is launched . It may take two more days for it to be floated down to the " sea " , and only when it is safely on the Congo does the new owner take over . He has already paid half the price as a deposit ; now he pays the rest , plus five or six goats for the villagers who have helped in the launching . And so begins the life of a new canoe that will proudly ply up and down the Congo for the next ten years . Shortly before leaving East Africa I had had a letter from an American curio dealer with a very strange request  --  for " anything up to fifty thousand arrowheads " . Just how or where he planned to sell these I have no idea ; but those in the novelty market seem to be able to sell anything to someone , somehow . Though one can find arrowheads in almost any part of the African continent , to find them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most Africans buy perhaps six or a dozen at a time , use them over and over again , and when out hunting spend a long time looking for them . Whilst in Stanleyville , however , I learned that some of the forest people , who use small expendable arrows for hunting birds , produce them in very large quantities . One place where I was told I could buy them at least by the thousand was a small village called Wamba , not far from Paulis , about three hundred and fifty miles to the north east of Stanleyville . So when I returned from my journey to the canoe-makers I followed the arrows that led to Paulis . Paulis was then a town of some importance , being the railhead for the whole north-eastern corner of the Congo where it borders 111 on Uganda and the Sudan . The tribes that live around Paulis consist largely of Bantu people traditionally ruled over by a remarkable group of Nilotic overlords called the Mangbetu . There were a number of things about the Mangbetu that made them , in Belgian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , were famous far and wide as hair-stylists ; and they were known also for their peculiar custom carried on until recently , of elongating their heads . This was done in early childhood , when the bone was soft , by binding the cranium tightly in strips of raffia . It was done primarily to enhance their beauty and appeared not to damage their brains in any way . Another interesting thing about the Mangbetu was their women 's dress . This consisted of a little grass flap in the front , and a thing called a " negbe " behind . The " negbe " consisted of a flat oval of palm fronds sometimes woven in beautiful designs , so made that when the wearer sat down it automatically folded beneath her bottom providing her with a clean " mat " to sit on . The idea of the " negbe " is thousands of years old and , as can be seen on tomb reliefs , was once used in Egypt . Another thing for which the Mangbetu were well known was their house painting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Africa . Many of the designs used were symbolic representations of the sun and the moon , shields , throwing-knives , and things of that nature ; others of more recent origin were of animals and strangely rigid humans . 112 With the help of the Belgian Administrator of Paulis I had no difficulty in finding the local smiths , a subject people of the Mangbetu , who worked in several small hamlets near the main road to Wamba . Their task was a lowly one , and their products were rough . Their skill in no way compared to that of the Bushongo and Bamanga smiths of old who had produced the knives I had purchased earlier . To beat out a curved sickle blade a yard long , even in width and thickness , requires a degree of skill that even the best smiths in Europe would be proud of . These smiths of Paulis produced dozens of arrowheads an hour which they stored , like hundreds of thousands of coins poured into treasure chests , in old Belgian army ammunition boxes . In the course of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three thousand of these arrowheads , counted out laboriously one by one , at a cost of a penny each . I was not able to make more than two hundred per cent profit on these , but that covered the cost of my excursion to Paulis . I was now slowly wending my way home towards East Africa . The road took me by way of the little hamlet of Mungbere to the town of Mambasa in the heart of the great Ituri forest , the home of the Pygmies . The last thirty-five miles of this road , once it crosses the river Dui , follows almost exactly the trail of Stanley 's terrible journey from Ihuru to Fort Bodo ( Mambasa ) on his ridiculous expedition to relieve Emin Pasha in Equatoria . It was here , between the Dui and the Ituri rivers that Stanley came nearer to meeting his death than at any other time on his travels . Harried by bands of Pygmies unseen in the undergrowth ; fever ridden , depressed and on quarter rations ; it was here that he pitched the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his men died . " On my bed that night , " he wrote , " the thought of the men sent to forage for food troubled me ; but however distasteful was the idea that a terrible misfortune might befall them ? such as being lost in the woods , or collapsing from hunger before they reached the groves ? it , was impossible not to regard the darkest view and expect the worst , in order , if possible , to save a remnant of the Expedition that the news might be carried to the Pasha and thence to civilisation some day . I pictured the entire column perished here in this camp , and the Pasha wondering month after month what had become of us , and we corrupting and decaying in this unknown 113 corner in the great forest and every blaze on the trees healed up , and every trail obliterated within a year , and our burial place remaining unknown until the end of time . " All they saw was the eternal myriads of trees with a dead black unknown environing the camp round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stern prospect of rigid wood with a dark cope of leaves burying them out of sky and sunshine , as though they lived under a pall . " The journey took Stanley and his bedraggled , dwindling band of two hundred men twenty days to accomplish , a fact that I pondered deeply as I sped down the road through a rainstorm . Now , only a life-span after the explorer 's epic struggle the same journey would take me little more than an hour . And as I pressed my foot on the accelerator I wondered what Stanley would have felt had he been able to cross this desperate forest as rapidly as I , with visions of a steaming hot bath , a whisky and soda , and a comfortable bed awaiting him in Mambasa . The " eternal myriads of trees " , the " rigid wood " , and the " dark cope of leaves " flashed by like majestic lines of unconcerned , unhindering spectators . I came to a bend ? and suddenly , without warning , the Land Rover went into a skid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideways , on and on it went , gathering speed towards a six-foot ditch by the side of the road . Vainly I struggled with the wheel and tried to break the skid ; but it was no use . With a petrifying trump I hit the back of the ditch ; and there I hung , tilted and bent , with the rain beating down upon me , and not a village , not a soul within miles . I clambered out into the mud to look at the damage . The wing was smashed , the wheels had taken on an alarming squint , and I feared that the chassis might also be cracked . It was already dark and late , and the chances of anyone passing me now were remote . There was only one thing to do ; to spend the night in extreme discomfort , curled up on the seat of the car , bruised and wet , and at an acutely painful angle . Damn that , whisky and soda , I thought . Damn the jungle , and damn Stanley and his troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was still raining , and I was shocked and depressed . This was a little-used road , and it was possible that no one would pass me for hours , or even the whole day and the next night . So I pulled myself together and set , about the back-breaking task of trying to get the car back on the 114 road by piling rocks beneath it and jacking it up inch by inch . But just then I heard a low moaning through the forest , an intermittent rumble and roar that grew louder , and suddenly a lorry came round the bend labouring through the mud . The driver stopped , and from the back of the lorry poured twenty hulking Africans who took one look at the car , surrounded it , and lifted it bodily on to the road as though it were a feather . The car could not be driven , so hitching it to the back of the lorry they towed me slowly the remainder of the way to Mambasa . There , to my relief , I discovered that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing beaten straight , and I was ready to continue the journey . I saw a number of Pygmies while passing through the Ituri forest , but there seemed to be little point , in spending any time among them . Apart from some of their knives and arrowheads which are wrought in attractive shapes , and their tiny bows which are sheathed with the skins of monkeys ' tails , they produce very little of interest either to art dealers or to curio hunters . So leaving the Ituri I came out of the Congo forests for good , and up into the plains . From the business point of view my journey was more or less over , though I bought a few more bits and pieces by the roadside where I could . Since leaving East Africa I had been able to pay my way from place to place , though the overall profit was small . I had found that , some of the traditional arts and crafts were still being practised , though many had died away completely . In many places , where old objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the quality of modern workmanship , where it existed , rarely matched that of the olden days . I do not know what has happened in the Congo since the Belgians left , but I can only conjecture that such organisations as the Bushongo craftsmen 's cooperative have crumbled . Without the spur of the Belgian Administration I doubt whether the Africans have been able to keep them going . Very few African craftsmen have proved capable of running an export business on their own ; language , lack of experience , inability to judge quality , bad packing , and a tendency to overcharge , being the main stumbling blocks . Tourism in the Congo has dropped right away ; thus the main local market for commercial work has gone . Oppressed by so many economic , political and other problems it is doubtful whether the artists of the Congo will ever again receive sufficient official encouragement and backing to 115 produce anything of value . The situation among artists and craftsmen was bad enough when the Belgians were there . Today it must be far worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later I arrived back in Mombasa . After nearly a year away the inevitable feeling of anti-climax which follows any exciting journey descended on me . But Mombasa was home , and it was good to be back . People in the streets greeted me ; familiar faces smiled . It was good to see the sea again ; to strip off and plunge into the waves ; to hear the hushed wind singing in the casuarinas ; and feel the sun-baked grains of sand between my toes . It was good to savour the smells of the Arab town once again , to flirt with laughing girls in purdah , and to see the lights of the big ships in the harbour and to hear their sirens wailing . I no longer had the shop now , but I still had the business . I rented a store-room and carried on as I had left off , buying salad servers by the score , feathered warriors by the thousand , heads and figurines and animals and bowls and stools and drums and more heads and figurines . But my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the Congo , amongst many other things , I had been impressed by the art-schools and craftsmen 's co-operatives . The Kenya government had once encouraged similar co-operatives among the Kamba carvers , and , indeed , had done much to establish this trade . But apart from that there was absolutely no official encouragement given to the arts in schools , or help for already established artists . Admittedly , good artists and craftsmen were few and far between in Kenya , but there were some flagrant examples of government disinterest . One of my engineer friends working on the docks came to me one day and told me he had recently taken on an Arab carpenter to construct packing cases and crates . This man claimed to be a woodcarver by profession . There used to be many Arab woodcarvers on the East African coast who carved the magnificent doorways for the palaces of Zanzibar and Lamu , and did other beautiful work in a similar style . So attractive did rich tourists find their work , in fact , that the export of Arab doors from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denuded . But so imposing was this Arab workmanship , too , that the Kenya Government had seen fit to install a pair of doors in the new Legislative Council building in 116 Nairobi , just as the Tanganyika Government had installed Arab doors in the High Court building in Dar-es-Salaam . These had been recently carved in Mombasa at the Muslim Institute . When I met this maker of packing cases and crates from the docks , I very soon discovered that he was one of the last remaining traditional Arab carvers . Abdulla Ali Skanda , in fact , had done much of the work on the Legislative Council doors and had made the set for Dar-es-Salaam . Since that time the Muslim Institute had had to close its workshop , and Ali , and one other carver , had been forced to find other work . Thus , the Arab craft that over the centuries had given so much to the character of East Africa was now dead ; buried , in fact , in a cheap packing case . This was typical of the general state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it struck me that to combat it , two things were needed : first , more interest and opportunity for the arts in the schools , and secondly , an outlet through which indigenous artists and craftsmen could sell their work . Only with this encouragement would there be any hope of releasing any latent artistic talent among the Africans , or developing any appreciation of quality amongst existing artists and craftsmen . So I launched forth on a one-man campaign . To arouse support for more " art in education " I felt that an exhibition of African child art might be useful . The man to help me here was obviously Laurent Moonens in Elisabethville . He was keen on the idea when I suggested it to him , and he sent me an excellent selection of work from his school . This I exhibited in Mombasa , Nairobi , Nakuru , Kitale , Kampala ( and later , in the new art gallery in Salisbury , Southern Rhodesia ) , and the response was astonishing . Both Africans and Europeans were amazed that African children were capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the exhibition , an entree into government circles . The Department of Education was interested , and began to take notice of what could be done ; though ultimately I fear that active changes in schools policy about art became bogged down in bureaucratic detail . On the second front , developing an outlet for artists and craftsmen of quality , I had other ideas . My idea was to set up a centre where artists and craftsmen , if their work was good enough , could not only sell their products but also come to work . Abdulla Ali Skanda , and another young Arab carver named Ali Mohamed , 117 were very keen on this idea , and would certainly have formed a good nucleus for the workshop . There were a number of Africans scattered throughout East Africa who would have come , in addition to several of the best Makonde carvers . The whole plan was worked out in detail , and circulated to business firms , farmers known to be interested , and organisations such as the East African High Commission . But government backing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore submitted to the Minister concerned , and discussions held . Letters went back and forth by the dozen . It was quite amazing how much sympathy and encouragement the scheme received from all quarters , including the government . But when it came to the point , were the government , prepared to back it ? Finally it became clear that in their view support of the arts was not their concern . Though perfectly polite , they could not have cared less . Had I had a workshop I might have employed Abdulla and Ali myself . But as it turned out , with the idea for the crafts centre rejected , my own plans were shortly to change . And so far as I know , Abdulla and Ali are still making packing cases and crates ? unless by now they have joined the curio hucksters in the gutters of Mombasa . // The " Big Big House " For several months life continued in Mombasa as before , as I bought and packed East African curios for export to the United States . But as time went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa had done more than provide me with an opportunity for some personal " exploration " ? enjoyable though that was ? for it had opened my eyes to many aspects of African culture about which I had previously known nothing . Above all , it had made me realise how lightly I was skimming the surface of the subject in which I was interested ? African art and ethnography ? by confining myself to the narrow bounds of the curio trade . And now an urge began to grow to study the subject on a more serious level ? to go to a university , if I could , and take a course in anthropology . Having no previous academic qualifications , finding a place in a university proved more difficult than I had expected ; but after much correspondence I was finally able to sign on for a course in Social Anthropology at University College , London . So in due course , having made an arrangement with some Asian friends to take over my business , I put up my shutters in Mombasa and came back to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and African ethnography in particular ? there is no better place to be than in London ; for apart from the various private galleries and small museums in the home counties , there is that ever-present pile , the British Museum , where some of the finest collections in the world are housed . From University College it is only a few minutes ' walk to the " B.M. " , and there I spent many hours in the galleries and libraries . There , too , after a short while , I struck up a friendship with the museum ethnographers . The senior Africanist at the B.M. is a man named Bill Fagg , and through Bill I became acquainted with the work of his brother , Bernard Fagg , who was then the Director of Antiquities for the Nigerian Government . 119 Nigerians take immense pride in their artistic achievements , and their Government spends tens of thousands of pounds each year on the preservation of important historical and traditional work . This legitimate pride stems from a wealth of artistic tradition that has been developing for as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts of Nigeria ? the countless sculptures of the Yoruba and dozens of other tribes ? are of relatively recent origin . But behind these lie the great traditions of places like Benin and Ife , whose masterful bronze workers had already achieved a high degree of technical skill as early as the thirteenth century ; and the much earlier " Nok " culture whose fascinating pottery heads and figurines may date back to a period between 900 and 200 B.C. These antiquities and works of art are preserved in several museums scattered throughout , Nigeria , the largest of which are in Lagos , and Jos ? a small town on the high central Nigerian plateau where the Department of Antiquities has its headquarters . 120 One day I received a letter from Bernard Fagg suggesting that I might like to go out to Nigeria during the long vacation to set up a small museum in the Southern Cameroons . The Southern Cameroons , he told me , was an area rich in sculpture , much of which was in danger of being lost forever if no attempts were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary for this job , all my expenses would be paid by the Nigerian Government , and I stood to gain a great experience that would cost me nothing . Obviously this was an opportunity not to be missed , so I accepted the invitation . And on the first day of the summer vacation I boarded a ' plane that took me across the Sahara to Kano , and on to Jos . At Jos I was met at the airport by Bernard Fagg , a dark , goodlooking chap , and a complete contrast to his learned brother Bill , who even in his appearance reflects the solidarity of the B.M. itself . In the course of the next few days I spent as much time as possible finding out about the area I was to visit , and receiving my instructions from Bernard . My headquarters in the Cameroons were to be in Bamenda , the main town in the high , cool grasslands . There was at the time no special museum building in Bamenda ? a fact which presented a slight problem . However , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a building lying empty that might prove suitable , but this I would have to check . I would have plenty of money with which to make purchases , and both still and cine-cameras to make photographic records of dances , and of objects I was unable to buy . A junior assistant from the Jos Museum , named Osula , would accompany me to help with documentation and the technical problems of preservation . A Land Rover would meet us when we arrived in the Cameroons , and would be available for our use throughout our stay . Beyond that , as Bernard put it , I was on my own , and I would just have to do the best I could in the three months available . " Oh , and one other thing , " added Bernard , almost as an afterthought . " We are making you an unofficial agent of Interpol while you are there . " We had been sitting in his office in the Jos museum while he was briefing me , surrounded by sherds and beads and other esoteric archaeological and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark of this sort , and for a moment I could hardly believe my ears . What on earth could this have to do with setting up a museum , I wondered , and I asked Bernard to explain . 121 " Well , I can tell you quite briefly , " he said . " Recently a number of valuable pieces of sculpture have been missed from our museum at Oron ? the sort of pieces that could fetch thousands of pounds on the world market . At first we thought they might have been taken by local people who wanted them as juju ; but a short time ago one of them turned up in a gallery in New York , and it became obvious this was no local theft , but the work of an international organisation that really knew its stuff . So we got on to Interpol and asked them to make a check of all known African art dealers in Europe and the United States . One of their agents in Germany paid a call on a woman named Frau K. , and reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said she had collected herself . " " What 's wrong with that ? " I said . " Well , as you know , it 's illegal to export works of art from this country without the consent of my department ; and we have never heard of this Frau K. Although we 've got no proof she was responsible for the Oron thefts , we became a bit suspicious when we heard she was planning another trip to Africa . " " You think she may have agents here , collecting for her ? " " We do n't really know . Anyway , Interpol have been keeping their eyes on Frau K. She 's in Africa now , and the last we heard was that she was in Brazzaville , about to come north to Nigeria . She 's travelling with her son and daughter-in-law in a Volkswagen bus , apparently ; and if she 's planning to come overland , she must inevitably come through the Cameroons . " " And what do you want me to do ? " " Just keep your eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out what they are up to and where they are going . Send us a cable if you hear anything , or , if it seems urgent , cable the C.I.D . in Lagos . Incidentally the agent in Germany managed to get hold of a photograph of her . I 've got a copy here . " Bernard opened a file on his desk marked " Frau K ... " , and from a bundle of correspondence took out a photograph and handed it to me . It was of a thick-set , dark-haired woman , who reminded me of a Bavarian hotelier 's wife I had known on Kilimanjaro , whom I always pictured with an alpenstock and a rucksack on her back plodding through the high forests ? tough as a root . There were probably lots of women like this in the Cameroons ? Germans who had come back after the first war when the old colony of Kamerun had been 122 handed over to Britain as a mandated territory ? and I felt it was pretty unlikely that we would meet up with her unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pocketed the photo , and told Bernard we would do what we could . Osula and I left Jos the next day , flying down to Lagos first , to buy film for my cine-camera , then straight on to Tiko in the Cameroons . This was Osula 's first experience of flying , and he was very nervous . He was a Bini tribesman from the city of Benin , a little chap in his early twenties , with round features and rather tired eyes . Later , when I came to know him better , I felt he was a nice person , though one of those who feel unduly sorry for themselves if things do n't go quite their own way . At the museum in Jos he lived a tidy , comfortable existence , and I do n't think he ever really wanted to come on this journey . He was not very adventurous , and longed for nothing more than to be pottering around in the warmth and safety of the museum workshop back home . Later , he was forever searching for excuses that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on trek ; and before we had left Jos , he had tried hard to persuade Bernard to let him travel to the Cameroons overland , as he did n't like the idea of flying . It was therefore all the more unfortunate for Osula that the flight to Tiko was about as bad as it could have been . Tiko airport lies at the base of the 13,000-foot Mount Cameroon , the western slopes of which receive about 400 inches of rain a year , one of the highest rainfalls anywhere in the world . This incessant rain , and the clouds that forever hang over the mountain , make Tiko one of Africa 's most hazardous airports , and as luck would have it , the day we flew in , it was shrouded in murky grey mist . For ten or fifteen minutes , when we should have landed , our Dakota droned through the clouds , endlessly circling . Inevitably , perhaps , with the huge volcano lurking unseen behind a wall of cloud , there was a feeling of nervous tension and expectancy amongst the passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what he 's doing , " the man next to me said , as we droned through the clouds . " A ' plane flew straight into the mountain a couple of days ago . " Osula , who was sitting in front of me , looked round , his eyes nervously flicking from me to the man who had spoken , and a banana planter across the gangway added a reassuring comment . 123 " Christ , man , these chaps love the bloody mountain . We 'll be the fourth to hit it this year . " I saw Osula fidgeting with his safety belt , tightening it a little bit more . The pilot 's voice came over the intercom to say that we would have to land at Douala in the French Cameroons ; but as he clicked off , the clouds below us parted . We could see Tiko airport down below , and we came in to land safely . Osula heaved a sigh of relief , but as we climbed down from the ' plane he told me that next time he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sympathise with him . As arranged before leaving Jos , a Land Rover met us at Tiko , and the same day we set off on the two-day journey up to the grasslands , and Bamenda . On our way we spent one night in Mamfe , a town in the low-lying forests of the coastal plains where , in my capacity as Interpol 's " man in the Cameroons " , I wanted to have a word with the police , as Mamfe lay on the route into Nigeria . It was late on Saturday night when we arrived , and late the next morning before I was able to meet the police officer , who resolutely refused to have his Sunday morning lie-in disturbed . I told him about Frau K. and her entourage , and showed him the photograph Bernard had given me . His reaction was immediate . He had barely looked at the picture when he let out an excited oath . " Well I 'm damned ! " he almost shouted . " I 've seen this bitch recently ! She was here only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had trouble with the car , and had to put up at the rest-house for the night . That 's her all right . Said they were filming , or something , and making recordings for some T.V. outfit . Told me they were going straight from here to Lagos . " There seemed to be no doubt in his mind . But if they were going direct to Lagos it did n't sound as though they were planning to collect any " antiquities " * on the way , and I wondered if we were barking up the wrong tree . Neither of us wanted to chance it , however , so we roused the telegraphist and sent priority cables to C.I.D . Lagos , and to Bernard in Jos . 124 My part as an Interpol man ended there , almost before it had begun . But brief though it may have been , it proved effective . C.I.D . Lagos contacted all shipping companies and found that Frau K. and Co. were booked out on a ship sailing on Tuesday , two days after our discovery at Mamfe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless she was actually caught in the act of smuggling , the police planned to lie low and watch what went on in the Customs House . But unfortunately , before it ever came to that , things went wrong . When Frau K. went into the shipping office to collect her boat tickets , an over-zealous shipping clerk blithely informed her that the C.I.D . had been enquiring about her . Realising what was afoot , Frau K. immediately declared everything she had . And what she had was quite astonishing . In three days , passing through Eastern Nigeria , she had somehow managed to pick up fifty crates of articles , the export of which were prohibited under the Antiquities Ordinance . How she had done it was a mystery ; but her organisation must have been superb . She had nearly eight hundred Ibo and Ibibio masks ? more than some experts thought existed in the entire region ? and numerous other pieces worth ? 10,000 or more in the world markets , which must have been gathered for her by African agents in the bush over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had intended to smuggle them out , as all the crates were carefully labelled " Personal Effects " . Later it transpired that on a previous journey she had taken out an even greater quantity , and that she had done so by bribing a customs official . Though no charge could be laid against her ( because she had declared what she had purchased ) , the Department of Antiquities were determined to see that she did n't get away with this valuable haul , even though the only way they could do this was by purchasing the goods from her at a nominal price that they themselves were able to assess . This they did ; and Frau K. , to everyone 's delight , , left Nigeria in high dudgeon , vowing never to return . I experienced a certain sense of pride that I had played a part in putting an end to this lucrative smuggling racket ; but with memories of crossing from Mocambique to Tanganyika with a meagre haul of thirteen crates of masks when I myself was in business , I cursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground ! 125 When early European travellers named the Guinea coast of Africa " The White Man 's Grave " , they did so with good reason , for much of West Africa consists of dank , low-lying forest that is oppressive , sombre , and not particularly healthy for Europeans even today . The forests cover the wide coastal plains that extend inland for many miles before gradually giving way to dry , sunburnt savannah , and finally the Sahara desert . Just occasionally , from this unattractive landscape , small areas rise like pimples , not to the great heights of the Ethiopian plateau or the Kenya highlands , but to sufficient altitude to break into the layer of cool air above the humid lowlands . Jos plateau is one such area , and the Cameroon grasslands another . As Osula and I drove up from Mamfe to Bamenda , we climbed gradually , out of the forests , to beautiful , rolling , open hills between three and five thousand feet above sea level , occasionally rising to peaks of seven and eight thousand feet . Bamenda Station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of a cliff , with a glorious view across the rolling hills . Down below , at the foot of the Bamenda escarpment , lies Abakpa Township , the seething , colourful , commercial centre of the area . When we arrived , we went straight up to the Station where , for a few days , we installed ourselves in the rest-house . As we expected to be almost incessantly on the move during the next few weeks , visiting every corner of the Grasslands , and others besides , I set about making some preliminary preparations as soon as I could . I needed large-scale maps of the area , a good interpreter , and a cook . I had to pay my respects to the District Officer ; and also I wanted to meet a Baptist Missionary named Paul Gebauer . Paul was a ball of fire whose tremendous energy belied his age . He had served with the German navy against the British in the first world war but had since become an American citizen . He had been in the Cameroons for years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of the Grasslands as anyone else alive . He himself had an excellent collection and was able to advise me on many of the best hunting grounds , and he was also able to help in finding an interpreter and a cook . John , the cook , was a cheerful character with a mop of black hair , who had had considerable experience as a cook " on tour " . Having once had to look after a District Officer like a king , he meted out the same treatment to me . Everywhere we went , John 126 carried with him a home-made oven , and never a morning passed without him preparing me a steaming hot camp-bath before he woke me up . As , later , I used to get very agitated at the casual way the porters treated my collections , John christened them my " children " ; and I returned the compliment by making him chief " nanny " to see they were looked after properly . My interpreter was one of the finest people I ever met in Africa . His name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa Kisob . For many years he had been the senior Government Interpreter , but was now retired . It amused and delighted me the way in which , on arrival at many Fon 's palaces , Pa Kisob was given all the honours , and I was relegated to second place . But I think he deserved them . I had tremendous respect and admiration for him myself , and the ultimate success of the whole expedition was very largely due to his knowledge and sound judgement . An interpreter can make or break a job of this sort , and there was never any doubt as to which he did . Another important question that had to be dealt with as soon as we reached Bamenda was that of the museum building . The District Officer had told us in a letter that there was a vacant building at our disposal . But what was this building ? Was it suitable ? Even when I asked the D.O . about this I thought I detected a fleeting look of doubt flash beneath his Irish smile . " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be happy with it . It 's a little place up here on the escarpment that 's been empty for some time now . It 's very secluded and quiet , but it should be very good from the point of view of security . You see , it 's the old mortuary . " Well , there are mortuaries and mortuaries . Possibly an old mortuary might make an excellent museum . I just did n't know . But as there seemed to be no alternative building , I felt I should have a look , at least . The D.O . gave me the key , and a messenger to show me the way . We drove up the road , beyond a row of houses and into a plantation of gum trees . After about half a mile the messenger signalled me to stop by a small track that led off the road into the plantation . We got out of the car , and the messenger pointed into the trees . " In there " , he seemed to be saying . " You 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to come with me ; but he was reluctant , and preferred to stay by the car . So I went into the trees by myself . I had gone a few yards when I noticed over the track an archway 127 of saplings tied together , from the centre of which hung a small brown bundle of rags . I had seen this sort of thing elsewhere in Africa , and wondered if it was what I thought it was , a juju , warning people to keep away . The gum trees were tall and closely packed ; the plantation was gloomy and damp . Two or three hundred yards along the track I noticed the building . It was small , very small , with rusty iron on its roof and old grey whitewash flaking from its walls ; tall leafy gum trees grew right up against it . I approached along a path overgrown with weeds and turned the key in a rusty lock . The door was swollen with damp , and it scraped with a chilling screech over the concrete floor as I pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed . The glass in the windows was broken , and cobwebs , matted and dusty , hung from the corners . There were two rooms ; one was empty , and in the centre of the other stood the cold , stark , concrete slab ? the resting place of countless bodies now rotting beneath the earth . I looked around . It was vacuous and silent like an empty skull , except for something that lay on a darkened ledge in the corner . I moved over to look , and my fingers closed round a broken rib , and a fragment of blackened cranium . Secure from robbers I am sure it was ; but what would be the use of a museum to which nobody would dare go ? The mortuary was out of the question . I returned the key to the District Officer with thanks and wondered where to turn next . Down in Abakpa there was a Community Hall , built co-operatively by all the tribes of the Grasslands . The hall was bright and large , and had , in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables and chairs and a collection of educational books . When I visited the hall , it struck me that , although quite a few people used the library , the main room showed no signs of having been used for a long time . Furthermore , it seemed that at some time it may even have been intended as a museum of sorts , for in a corner stood several empty showcases . I immediately felt that this would be a perfect museum in every respect . It was in the centre of the town and easily accessible to all the local Africans ( for whom , after all , the museum was being set up ) . If security would be more problematical here than in the mortuary , the hall had every other advantage . So I spoke to the secretary and asked if we could call a committee meeting to discuss the possibility of making this into Bamenda 's Folk Museum . He 128 himself thought it an excellent idea , and two or three days later the Committee gathered . The population of the Grasslands is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike in many respects , but different in others . The tribes are ruled by Paramount Chiefs , or Fons , some of whom , like the Fons of Bafut , Bali and Nsaw , are very powerful , whilst others are little more than figureheads . The Committee consisted of seven Fons from tribes around Bamenda . The Fon of Bafut presided over the meeting , at which the Fons of Mankon , Bamessing , Bamunka , Balikumbat and Babanki were also present . The Fon of Bali sent // First , through Pa Kisob , I put my case to the assembled chiefs . As they knew , I said , the customs of their country were changing fast . Their children coming from schools were no longer interested in the fine things of the olden days . The juju of days gone by were losing their power ; the new juju of the young generation were the books in the library , and the mammy-wagons on the roads . The Fons nodded agreement . It would be tragic , I went on , if , in the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which their country had become known across the seas and all round the world , were to be forgotten and lost . In my country ? in England ? and even in other places in Nigeria , there were many big big houses which we called " museums " in which all the fine old things of our ancestors were kept . In these big big houses they were safe and carefully looked after , and they were the pride and joy of the young people who were able to look at them , and say that these things were the wonderful things made by their forefathers . Again the Fons nodded their understanding . I went on in similar vein , pointing out how easily the things of their country could be destroyed , how many in fact had already been destroyed by fires , and reminding them of the fact that in modern times the craftsmen among them were more interested in becoming mechanics than woodcarvers or metal casters . When I had finished , I was asked to leave the room whilst the Fons went into a huddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or twenty minutes , I was called in to hear the verdict . The Fon of Bafut spoke . They were pleased , he said , that the government were interested in preserving their old old things , and they first wished to express their thanks to the government and to me . They themselves were in agreement with what I had said , and had been worried by the way in which the fine things of their ancestors were disappearing . They were happy that these things could now be collected together and preserved , and they were in agreement that the Abakpa Hall should be the place where they were to be kept . Thus we acquired the use of the Community Hall as our museum , and with one of the main problems now cleared up , we were free to set about the business of collecting . The traditional art of the Cameroon Grasslands , like that of other 130 tribal groups of Africa , is distinctive both in form and style . Most of the objects that I set out to collect were made of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house-posts , and figurines . The style of this region is bold , though lacking in sophistication . The lines are generally curvaceous , and the effect is bulbous . The artists love to portray people , usually voluptuously ; if a woman , heavily pregnant , and if a man , generously endowed with exaggerated sexual organs . Even more , they love animals of every description ; " bush-cows " with large horns , elephants with smooth ears and lengthy trunks , leopards , spiders , bats , and monkeys ? all executed in a simple , even crude , but powerful way with very little surface decoration . Apart from woodcarvings I hoped to find many other things such as pipes , some of clay , and others smoked only by " big men " 131 and Fons , cast in bronze . In some areas the pottery is elaborate and beautiful ; while other craftsmen are well known for making finely carved drinking horns . Having studied the map of the Grasslands carefully , I found it hard to know where to begin . At the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region around Bamenda with the exception of the Fon of Bali . So I decided , first , to visit him in his palace which lies about , twelve miles to the west of Bamenda . I sent a message to the Fon the day before I planned to go , asking if my visit was in order , and he replied that he would look forward to meeting me . I had heard stories about this man , and he sounded an interesting character . He had the reputation of being the most powerful tribal ruler in the Grasslands ? and one story I was told seemed to bear this out . Not long before my arrival , the government had decided to build an airstrip near Bamenda . This was not particularly easy on account of the rolling nature of the land , and the choice of sites was limited But a flat-topped hill belonging to the Fon of Bali was finally chosen . The land was surveyed , and estimates for clearing the field drawn up . But to the horror of the Public Works Department who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their estimates far exceeded the budget that had been allotted . Furthermore , they calculated that the work would take at least six weeks , and that they would not be able to complete it , as they had hoped , before an impending visit from the Governor . In desperation , the engineer in charge went to the Fon of Bali to see if he could help in any way , hoping that the Fon might be able to provide some cheap labour . Having heard the situation , the Fon , who was keen to have the airstrip on his land for prestige purposes , agreed to have his own tribesmen do the job , under the engineer 's supervision . When asked how long he thought it would take his men , the Fon , after thinking about , it for a bit , replied casually : " I should say about two days . " Early one morning the Fon 's huge message gong was heard booming across the countryside , calling the tribesmen to work . From far and wide men , women and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shepherded them up to the hilltop , where they were organised in a long line across the field ; and by eight a.m. a huge work-force was assembled and ready . Then the signal was given to begin . With one accord , like a mighty army of ants eating its way across the field , the long line of people moved slowly ahead , ripping out bushes and clumps of tufted grass and levelling earth as they went . By half past ten that same morning the strip was cleared ? the job complete . It was estimated that between five and six thousand of the Fon 's subjects had answered his call to work . The palace of the Fon of Bali is typical of many of those in the Grasslands . Rows of tall buildings with mudded walls and steeply pitched thatched roofs surround a series of courtyards used for different purposes . Old men , with long , coloured , toga-like cloaks and small knitted skull-caps hover around the doorways like vultures keeping a watchful eye on all that goes on ; while the Fon 's wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coronet of cowrie shells , the younger ones more fully clad ? wander in and out giving the palace an air of desultory activity . When Pa Kisob and I arrived at Bali , we found the Fon seated in the main courtyard , giving audience to a group of vociferous tribesmen . There was obviously a bitter dispute in progress which it was hoped that the Fon might resolve , for two men were involved in a heated argument and looked as though they might at any 133 moment come to blows . The Fon seemed to be amused by the performance , and sat by , watching them with a broad grin , waiting for them to quieten down . In the meantime we waited at the entrance to the courtyard until he was ready to meet us . As we stood waiting I noticed that around the verandah surrounding the courtyard were a number of beautifully carved pillars . Paul Gebauer had told me that , such pillars were now rare in the Cameroons , and I therefore hoped to obtain several of them for the museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were naturally reluctant to tear their palaces apart . But these pillars that I saw here were in fact serving no functional purpose . The verandah roof was held up by stout uncarved posts , to which the others had been tied with wire purely for decoration . Seeing this , I was determined somehow to persuade the Fon to let me have one or two . When the argument in the courtyard was over , the Fon , having seen us waiting , motioned to the rest of the tribesmen to withdraw , and beckoned to us to go over and sit by him . Pa Kisob clapped his hands in obeisance before sitting down , and for a few minutes 134 he and the Fon chatted together . A servant brought a tall calabash of palm-wine , and as the others talked , I sat in silence sipping the " mimbo " , revelling in the primitive splendour about me , allowing my imagination to cast me back to the days when the veil of mystery that enshrouded Africa was being folded back by the first European explorers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to pay my respects to a great and powerful chief who held in his grasp the power of life or death . In spite of my feeling of awe , however , I fear I had upon my face a supercilious smirk as I mentally compared the wonders of civilisation in my homeland to the simple grandeur of the palace about me ? a feeling of inevitable superiority , of broader , worldly cognisance , by comparison with these people , whose horizons stretched no more than a few miles over the hills . Pa Kisob and the Fon fell quiet . The Fon motioned to his chinda to refill my horn of mimbo , then quietly turned on his throne towards me . " Well , " he said . " How is old London ? " I looked up in surprise for I had no idea he spoke English . " London has many memories for me , " he went on . " I liked to go to your Harrods ? it is a most amazing shop . And your Rolls-Royces are so wonderful ? so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Rolls-Royce in London . . . but no , I must not talk to you of these things . This is not what you have come to see me about . We must get down to business . " The Fon had made his point . He was not a man to be trifled with . 135 With Pa Kisob 's help I explained why I had come to see him , giving him much the same rigmarole as I had given the meeting in Abakpa . The Fon was interested , for he took great pride in his antiquities , and immediately he sent a servant into a back chamber to bring out some of his prize pieces to show me . There were several beaded calabashes , and royal stools supported by carved leopards , and by groups of squat men and women , and there was a beautifully cast bronze pipe-bowl in the form of an elephant 's head . I did not want everything ? it was not my intention to rob the Fons of all they possessed , but only to acquire a representative collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my eye , a stool and the pipe-bowl in particular . Now , by slow and endless argument , I had to persuade the Fon to release them for the museum . Though most of the works of art in the Cameroons are to be found in the palaces , they do not necessarily belong to the Fon himself . He is their custodian , on behalf of the tribe . Therefore , except on very rare occasions , the Fon himself could not make any decision regarding what should be done with them . Before any piece could be removed from his palace it was necessary to hold a meeting of the tribal counsellors to get their views . I knew what trouble could be caused if the Fon alone made the decision . One young Fon , the Fon of Bamessing , was at that very moment in dire trouble ? to such an extent that a large section of his tribe was trying to have him deposed ? for having broken his trust and sold certain 136 tribal objects to an American anthropologist . Although in Bali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any decision until he had held a council meeting . it was first necessary to tell him which pieces I was interested in , and to get his personal approval . Though he liked the idea of the museum , he was , like many Fons , reluctant to let any of his own pieces out of his sight . So the business of persuasion was gradual , involving argument after argument as to why he should let me have them . When we had discussed the pipe and the stool , I mentioned the pillars ; and these turned out to be a subject of special interest to him . The pillars were made up of a series of male and female figures standing one above the other . Each figure was different , and each , according to the Fon , told a different story or represented a famous character from the tribe 's past . Some of the figures were of men smoking , or riding horses , or climbing trees in search of honey . Another was a gruesome representation of a heavily pregnant woman ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her clutching the rope that was knotted around her neck . This , I was told , was the wife of a past Fon who was paying the price of adultery with a commoner . But the favourite carving was of a girl named Daiga . Daiga was supposed to have been the beautiful daughter of a great Fon who had lived many years ago . She had married one of the noblemen of Bali , and in due course had delighted everyone by producing twins , and here she was , portrayed for posterity , feeding the twins with palm-wine . The Fon went into ecstasies , and told me many other stories about her ; about her charm , her elegance , her ability , her wisdom and her beauty . I must confess that when I looked at the carving ? although , to give it its due , it was of some age and weather-beaten ? I found it . slightly difficult to recognise Daiga 's shining qualities . For one thing , for a girl with twins it struck me that Daiga had very small breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was possible that the sculptor had found it difficult to make them any larger , and when I mentioned this to the Fon he dismissed it as being of no importance . Then , moving round to the side , and going down on to my knees to inspect the carving more closely , I suddenly realised to my horror what was wrong . Visible only from my undignified position , from which one could see beneath her skirts , was proof undeniable that Daiga was a man ! The poor Fon : nobody had ever had the courage to tell him . He 137 was so shocked at this painful discovery that , there and then he promised me that , if nothing else , at least I would have Daiga . Eventually I got all the pieces I selected at Bali . On the guarantee that none of them would leave the country , the Fon and his counsellors allowed them to go to the Museum on the basis of a " permanent loan " . The next journey we made was to the country of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Grassland people , but culturally linked to them . This was a journey to the village of Fontem  --  or that at least was our intention when we set out from Bamenda . Fontem lies deep in the forests in the rugged mountains near what was then the border of the French Cameroons . To reach it inevitably involved a considerable amount of trekking , and as there were a number of villages in that region that had not previously been explored from an ethnographic point of view , I decided to make this into a longish expedition . The plan was for vehicles to take us and our porters down to a little village called Assong , about forty miles from Bamenda , from where we would trek into the forests visiting whatever villages we found , finally landing up in Fontem . Ten days later the vehicles would meet us at the village of Tali , on the nearest road to Fontem , about a hundred and forty miles from Bamenda . Pa Kisob did not accompany us on this journey . In the first place I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on what looked like being quite a tough trek , and secondly the District Officer had put me in touch with an ex-police sergeant who had spent a number of years in this region and was free to come . This interpreter 's name was Martin Assongwet . Martin was only about forty , but he had recently been invalided out , of the police and was now out of a job . He spoke English quite well , though nothing like so well as Pa Kisob . It was easy to tell he had been a policeman by his bearing and general attitude , though frankly I felt then that he had an unpleasant streak in him . He was a bit loud-mouthed ; he shouted at people , and hit them if they did n't do as he told them . But , however unlikeable he may have been at times , there is no doubt that he was extremely useful . He was there to interpret for me , and to help me collect ; and if only to please me , he pursued his job ruthlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ; Osula , 138 John , Martin , myself and nine porters . I was travelling in comfort compared with the rest , with everything including John 's kitchen stove . We had with us several crates of beer with which to soften up the village chiefs , and about two hundred pounds worth of silver shillings , weighing nearly half a hundredweight . These and the cameras were carried by myself , Martin and Osula , while John carried the kitchen equipment . The rest of the baggage , which included several tin boxes and rolls of cotton wool in which to pack the more delicate collections such as clay pipes , were carried by the porters . We set out from Assong in a long line , travelling for the first few hours along narrow paths across the open Grasslands . Soon we came to the top of a hill , and there , stretching away below us and into the distance , we looked out over ridge upon ridge of precipitously steep forest-covered hills , lurking like giant primeval monsters beneath a sinister grey sky . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it began to rain . At first it was a light shower , spattering on to the leaves above us , and dripping into the undergrowth beneath . But soon from over the hills an angry rumble of thunder closed in on us ; the spattering gave way to a dull drumming , and the heavy dripping became an incessant stream , churning the muddy paths into treacherous slime and obliterating all but the grey forms of the nearest trees . For the rest of that day the rain stayed with us as we slipped and slid up the steep hill paths , wading to our waists through swollen streams that plunged across our path and down into the gloomy valleys below . In the later afternoon we came to a small hamlet called Bamenji , which consisted of no more than two dozen rather derelict huts . We had not intended to stop there ; but all of us were soaked to the skin and tired , so we decided to stay the night . We were greeted by the headman , named Kweti , who was welcoming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two huts were cleared out and put at my disposal , one for my personal use , and one for John and Osula . Martin lodged with Kweti , and the porters found themselves a roof elsewhere . These forest-dwellers live a poor life in comparison to the people of the Grasslands . Their huts are small and dirty , and the people themselves lack the impressive bearing that gives an air of nobility to the people around Bamenda . Being such a small and derelict 139 little village , I did n't expect to find many " old old things " in Bamenji . Nevertheless , I thought it , was worth getting Martin to make a few enquiries , and it transpired that this insignificant place had one of the largest collections of dance-masks in the district . These were the masks of the Akambum society , which dances at funerals and other important functions . There are many different societies among the Cameroon tribes , each of which has its own types of masks , and those of the Akambum , made of cloth covered with multi-coloured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks in the Cameroons . They represent an elephant , having large ears , and long flaps hanging to the ground fore and aft , the front flap being the trunk . They are worn with magnificent cloaks made of orange , brown and white feathers that completely envelop the dancers . To the people of Bamenji , the " Akambum " masks are a source of income . A short time before my visit ? at the inauguration of the Fon of Pinyin , a village several miles away ? twenty-four members of the society had been paid seven pounds in cash and given four days of feasting and drinking , in return for dancing at the inaugural ceremony . Generally they were paid in kind , rather than cash ? at an average funeral they might receive 140 a fully grown sow , which in the long run might well be worth more than seven pounds . I wanted to buy a complete Akambum outfit . Kweti , and the other village elders , were quite agreeable , but asked me for the staggering sum of forty-five pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms what they could do with it , but when Martin saw me getting indignant he called me to one side . He knew about Akambum , he said , and knew their masks would be expensive . Apparently they were not made at Bamenji , but in a Bamileke* village some miles away in the French Cameroons . He agreed that forty-five pounds was too much , but said we would not be able to get one for much less . We finally agreed on thirty-two pounds for one outfit which was , I discovered later , only about two pounds more than they themselves had paid the maker . That night we fed off avocado pears , bought at the usual Cameroons price of four for a penny , and a chicken given me by Kweti that John roasted in his portable oven . Kweti had given me the chicken following an episode shortly after our arrival . While our rooms were being cleared out , and our fires being lit , we sat with Kweti in his hut drinking mimbo and drying out by his fire . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Kweti got up from his stool and reached up for a soot-covered bundle that hung from the rafters . I was n't paying much attention , and thought he was getting a bag of tobacco ; but when he had cut the string around the bundle , he unfolded the wings of two large , half-rotted bats . " I go cook ' um for chop , " he said grinning . " You like go chop ' urn ? " I said I would n't dream of robbing him of his dinner ; whereupon he went out and brought me the hen instead . It was pouring with rain when we went to bed , and still at it when we woke up the next morning . Rivulets of rain ran across the village square as I sat in the entrance to my hut despondently eating my breakfast . Kweti and Martin saw me and came over to talk to me . " Is the rain going to stop today ? " I asked them . Kweti looked around knowingly before replying . " You watch the chickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dancing , then 141 the rain will not stop . If they lie under shelter , then it will stop soon " I looked around for some chickens . There were several bedraggled specimens lying under a pile of wood by Kweti 's hut . " They are lying there , " I said . " That 's good " . The others did n't reply . They did n't seem to believe the chickens ; and sure enough a little while later several of them left their shelter and started to hop about in the rain , pecking at grit and pebbles . The principle , I was told , was that if the chickens thought it was going to stop , they would wait and look for their food in comfort ; but if they thought it was n't going to stop , then they had to scratch for what they could find , regardless of the weather . The chickens seemed to be right . It rained solidly the whole day . But if the chickens had to eat regardless , so we had to move on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole day long , slithering and sloshing through the mud , we plodded on towards a village called Mbechaw . Mbechaw lay at the foot of a long , very steep escarpment which gave the porters considerable trouble , and as I only had a light load of money-bags and a camera , I went on ahead . Near the bottom I noticed a silent gathering of old men , standing about in the rain in their Sunday best , Not thinking their presence was in any way connected with me , I greeted them , and walked straight on towards the village . But suddenly I realised that they were all following along behind me , so I stopped , and asked one of them what was going on . The old men obviously did n't understand me : but a small schoolboy in their midst spoke for them , slowly and deliberately . " Father ? we ? have ? come ? to ? greet ? you . " Indeed they had , and it was very moving . The old man whom I had addressed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was filthy with mud and soaked to the skin , but the circumstances now suddenly called for an assumption of gravity and pomp for which I was scarcely prepared . Doing my best to appear suitably dignified , I went the rest of the way to the village accompanied by this silent band . Apparently they had heard we were coming from some villagers who had passed us earlier . Martin must have told them to warn the chief , but obviously he did n't tell them who I was or what I was doing . The small boy had addressed me as " Father " ? I thought simply because I was old enough to be his 142 father ? but now suddenly everyone who spoke to me addressed me as " Father " . Realising that I was nothing to do with the Administration , they had concluded that I must be a missionary . As I have mentioned already , most of the best works of art in the Cameroons are to be found in the palaces of the Fons and chiefs , but here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find one of the most interesting pieces in my entire collection in the house of a commoner . That night in Mbechaw , accommodation having been arranged for everyone in advance , Martin went to stay with an old man named Bayembi , head of a family of the same name . During the evening , when they were alone in Bayembi 's hut , the two of them got talking about our job . Bayembi listened attentively as Martin explained what we were doing , and when he had finished the old man let slip that he had a very fine " old old t'ing " that had been in his family for many years . Martin asked him if he could see it , and the old man , clambering up into the rafters of his house , brought down a beautiful pipe . In all the years he had spent in the Widekum region , Martin had never seen a pipe like this , and he knew immediately that it was something I should see . It was about two feet long with a carved clay bowl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlaid with zinc or tin foil , in a way that I have never seen before or since . The bowl itself was geometric , and the whole thing was beautifully proportioned . Martin told Bayembi that he must show me the pipe ; but the old 143 man 's instinctive reaction was " No ! " He seemed to feel immediately that if once he showed it to me , he would ultimately be forced to part with it . So Martin got to work on him , bringing out all the arguments , assuring him that , if he did not want to sell it , all I would do would be to photograph it , and late that night Bayembi was finally persuaded to bring it to me the next day . Martin came to my hut early , very excited , to tell me what had transpired , and a short while later Bayembi arrived with his pipe carefully wrapped in layers of ancient raffia cloth . I confess , as soon as I saw it , I knew we had to have it , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbery to get it , into the museum . All that morning we sat discussing the pipe surrounded by absorbed villagers . Martin brought out his biggest and most outrageous guns . I had been sent personally by Her Majesty the Queen of England , he said , to collect and preserve the wonderful things of the Cameroons . The pipe , he said , would be put in the place of honour in the big big house in Bamenda . He and his family for generations would be able to go there to see it , and be able to say that this was theirs , the famous Bayembi pipe . The name of the Bayembi family would go far , not only in the Cameroons , but across the whole wide world . On and on and on he went ? mentally battering the poor old man . But Bayembi was adamant . He in turn told us the story of the pipe , and why he refused to part with it . It was , he said , acquired by his grandfather about ninety years ago , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pipe his grandfather had given one of his daughters in marriage . Only on great occasions and at annual celebrations was the pipe brought down from its hiding place , when it was proudly displayed to the people of the village as the very symbol of Bayembi unity . In all its long life it had never once been smoked , though when displayed it was filled ceremoniously with tobacco which was later taken out and given away . This was the tangible and visible link between the old man and his grandfather ? between all the Bayembis . If he were to part with it , the spirit of his ancestors would be angry , and the unity of the family would risk destruction . Martin and I redoubled our efforts . We offered him cash . The old man was indignant ; how could he dream of selling it for money . Finally I suggested that he part with it on a basis whereby the government would publicly declare that they were acting as custodians of the pipe on behalf of the Bayembi family ; that the 146 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of dire necessity could be taken out of the museum . Furthermore the government would donate to Bayembi the sum of ? 15 for the express purpose of purchasing another pipe or similar heirloom . We had been at it for over four hours , and finally we literally wore the old man down physically , and to this last suggestion he agreed , on condition that the money was paid in public so that all the village knew that he was accepting it on behalf of his family , not for himself . Even at that time I felt that we had been thoroughly brutal to old Bayembi , and that the pressure we had brought to bear on him was more than he might reasonably have been expected to withstand . I often felt the same when making purchases from people obviously reluctant to sell , but , though from a personal point of view I felt sorry for them , I had no compunction about doing everything within my power to get them to change their minds . My justification for this slightly ruthless attitude was borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nsaw , one of the three great Fons of the Grasslands . Happily , after lengthy discussions and meetings , the Fon finally allowed me to dismantle some rare and valuable door-posts for the museum . Several weeks later his entire palace was destroyed by fire . Fire has been the main cause of the destruction of the African artistic heritage throughout the centuries . African houses , built of timber , thatched with dry grass , and with open hearth fires inside them , are about the most impermanent type of buildings conceivable . Sooner or later , maybe next year , maybe in fifty years ' time , a family 's compound or a Fon 's palace is almost inevitably going to burn ; and unless a miracle happens , many or all the works of art within it are going to be destroyed . Unhappily the favourite medium of artistic expression in Africa has always been wood , with the result that very little of Africa 's artistic past has survived . The oldest piece that I collected in the Cameroons was at the outside limit two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - stool of Bangola was such a piece , which according to tradition had been used by seven Fons , each of whom had reigned for twenty-five to thirty years . It was in excellent condition , having been well looked after by a special servant , or " chinda " , whose first responsibility was to save it in case of fire . But the " throne " of Bangola was the only antiquity the Fon possessed . Everything else had been destroyed by fire . 147 Almost everywhere I went there was evidence of this hazard . The palace of the Fon of Bammessing had been burnt down shortly before I arrived , and though many things had been saved , many others not to be replaced were lost . One of the largest and most impressive objects I collected ? a seventeen-foot house-post ? I had only managed to acquire because it was lying outside the palace of the Fon of Babungo waiting to be rebuilt into a building that had been recently partially destroyed by fire . Many people believe that termites have been responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may be true . I collected many pieces that were half eaten by termites , but in each case the object had at some time or other been left out in the bush for several months or more . Termites can be , and usually have been , defeated by the constant care of the " chinda " ; but when fire sweeps through the compound at dead of night , nothing can defeat it , . It was for this reason , and this reason alone , that I was at times brutally avaricious in my attempts to get certain pieces by almost any means . But the fear and the threat of fire was at the same time their greatest enemy , and my greatest ally in persuading people to part with antiquities . When we left Mbechaw we set out across some of the wildest forest country I had ever seen to visit the village of Bamumbu . Except for a few breaks during which I had had a chance to film some dances at Mbechaw , the rain had not let up , and as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Osula was morose and complained of a headache ; everyone 's spirits were low . During the night I began to develop a cough ; and in the morning it was still raining . I was in a dilemma , and did not know quite what to do . If we waited for the rain to stop we might wait for days , yet the prospect of a long trek across the hills to Fontem in this weather was uninviting . Eventually , as it seemed that Bamumbu might be a good collecting ground , I decided to stay there for at least two days , and then see how things went . In Bamumbu , one of the most interesting things I found was a complete " orchestra " of double iron gongs belonging to a society called " Kwifon " . The Kwifon society , found in all the tribes of the Grasslands , is by far the most powerful of all societies , being the Fon 's special society to maintain law and order throughout the land . 148 In several places I visited I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only playing a symbolic role today , still can not leave the Fon 's palace without wearing the terrifying uniform of his profession ? a closely woven net cloak that entirely envelops his head and body ? and carrying with him the vicious gnarled wooden club that denotes his profession . The symbol of Kwifon everywhere is the double iron gong ; but nowhere else did I ever see such an orchestra as the one I found in Bamumbu . The gongs ranged in size from about ten inches to three feet tall . The complete orchestra consisted of ten gongs of different sizes with , in addition , two tall drums , two grass rattles , and a raucous iron rattle made up of six single gongs that achieved their effect by being banged together with a deafening clatter . The sound of the orchestra was one of the most fantastic I have ever heard , and rhythmically one of the most complex . The rhythm beaten out on each instrument was different ; yet the overall effect was one of unity . When playing , the fourteen members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see each other . At the beginning one gong ? no. 5 ? set the pace . With a rhythm that interwove with no. 5 's , no. 4 gong then came in , and so on down the line , each player taking his rhythm from the gong next to him , until all ten gongs were playing . Then , each in turn , the two drums came in , 149 adding a deep-throated throb to the hollow boom of the gongs . The drums were countered by the harsh scraping sounds of the wicker rattles ; and finally the bundle of single gongs punctuated the whole din with a series of resounding clangs like a thousand blacksmiths at work . The noise was phenomenal ; but this was no wildcat jazz , for each player conformed strictly to well-defined and practised rhythms . The sound of the Kwifon gongs echoing along the forest-clad valley of Bamumbu in the olden days must have been at once the most stirring and the most disturbing that the Fon 's subjects could hear , sufficient to instil fear and respect into all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely plays , and I was lucky to persuade them to do so for me . But when it came to trying to obtain some of the gongs for the museum , it was a different matter . Understandably , as the gongs made up a complete set , and as they were no longer being made , the society were unwilling to part with any . However , by the kindness of the Fon of Bamumbu , we managed to obtain one small gong that was not part of the orchestra . Our presence in the Widekum forests must have upset the rain gods in no mean way , for after two days at Bamumbu torrential rain was still churning the mountain slopes into torrents of mud . Although we had been away from Assong only five days , we were already two days behind schedule , and none of us relished the idea of the long slimy trek to Fontem , a tough journey even in fine weather . I discussed the situation with Martin , and although he felt that we would be able to reach Tali and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged , we agreed that there was little point in slogging out the journey , as we would have scarcely any time for collecting , and it would therefore be pointless . So we decided , whatever the weather the next day , to head back over our tracks to Assong , and from there get a lift back to Bamenda . If the outward journey had been uncomfortable , the return journey was thoroughly unpleasant . Osula , who had been complaining of a headache while we were at Bamumbu , now developed a fever , and for most of the journey was on the point of collapse . I , too , began to feel ill and exhausted , and every step became an effort , The wretched porters could hardly keep on their feet in the mire , and , as we had not been able to pack all my " children " in the tin boxes , I was worried about the condition of the rest , which were 150 wrapped , and only partially protected , in coverings of banana leaves . After two long days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beer hall , and collapsed exhausted and soaking on rows of grimy wooden benches around the walls . We had been there , I think , about half an hour , when someone at the door said they could hear a vehicle approaching . I went out and stood in the road , and a minute later a Land Rover came round the bend and stopped . Never in my life have I been more thankful to see a familiar face . It was Paul Gebauer . He knew we had gone on the trek to Fontem , and hardly expected to see us here ; but he wasted no time in conversation . Taking one look at Osula and me , and telling the others that he would send a lorry from Bamenda to collect them , he bundled us into the car and drove off . The only conversation I remember was when Paul asked if either of us was allergic to penicillin . I said I was , and I remember him muttering an unmissionary-like oath under his breath , adding that we would have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and did n't care . I was beyond feeling anything . The next day Osula and I awoke in Belo leper colony sixty miles from Assong to be told that we had bronchial pneumonia . Belo was the only place in the Cameroons where there was any aureomycin , and had we not met Paul we would have been in serious trouble . // The Alphabet in Bronze As soon as Osula and I were on our feet again , we made plans for a less strenuous expedition to a part of the Grasslands called the Ndop Plains . Pa Kisob now took over again from Martin Assongwet ; and as we expected to make sizeable collections , I hired a second Land Rover and arranged for a three-ton lorry to stand by if necessary , to transport larger pieces . Then we left Bamenda to set up our headquarters in the Ndop rest-house from which we were within easy reach of all parts of the district . The Ndop plains are inhabited by numerous small tribes , all of whom are closely related , but each of which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , therefore , to visit each one in turn ? Babanki , Bamessing , Bamali , Bamunka , Bambalang , Babungo , Bangola , Bamessi , Baba and several others with similar names , some of which were so similar as to become , at times , confusing . In addition to making these arrangements we saw to it that word spread around the country that we were in Ndop , and willing to consider purchasing anything that any commoners might care to bring to the rest-house . This last move was rewarding , and every morning before the cold mist had risen from the valley , we held a market outside the rest-house haggling over a vast assortment of odds and ends which , in the eyes of the business-like people of Ndop were invariably amazingly rare and valuable . ( The only truly rare pieces I bought in these markets were a pair of foot-high richly patinated ancestral figures which must have been stolen from a juju house at some time or other . So powerful a juju were they that neither Pa Kisob , John , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would dare touch them . This was the only occasion on which I ever saw a juju fill the Cameroonians with such fear . ) Each village had something different to offer . In Bambalang , for instance , I was fascinated by the enormous main building of the 152 Fon 's palace , the roofs of which drained into a small opening in the middle of the building . Beneath the opening was a grotto-like court with a pebble floor , where the Fon 's wives could collect , rain-water without having to venture outside . Bamessi was famous for its delicate pottery ; Babanki was the supposed home of woodcarving ? though when I visited it I found only one old woodcarver . At Babungo it was the Fon himself who was of greater interest ? a jolly young fellow of twenty-one who already had thirteen wives and twenty-two children . The Fons differed greatly in age , power , personality , political status , and wealth , and each one had to be approached in a different way . It was here that Pa Kisob was absolutely invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to know the quirks of the Fons like the back of his hand . He knew their various jealousies and secret rivalries , and exactly how to play one off against the other . Success with one frequently led to greater success with the next , who refused to be outdone by someone whom he looked upon as being an inferior Fan . When we came to visit the Fon of Baba , however , Pa Kisob warned me that we might have difficulties . The Fon of Baba , a middle-aged man , was well known as an avaricious and selfish character . He was disliked by most of his neighbours ? by some because he had shown himself to be too successful as a businessman , and by others because he was inclined to shun tradition . He 153 had a very lucrative coffee plantation from which most of his wealth came ; and he had built himself a " smart " new house with wooden window frames , a corrugated iron roof , and linoleum on the floor . Probably because he was so unpopular ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked him ? ? he distrusted everyone , and I was no exception . It was as much as I could do even to arrange a meeting with him , and when we did get together he was at first totally uninterested in the whole museum project . I would have left Baba without even bothering to argue with the Fon , had it not been for the fact that he possessed one " antique " that I badly wanted . This was an old carved bed that had been used by the Fons of Baba for generations . Such beds as these were at one time quite common in the Cameroons , but today they are extremely rare ; and I particularly wanted the one from Baba to complete a collection of " palace " furniture for the museum . At the time I knew of only one other such bed ? a beautiful piece belonging to the Fon of Bafut ? but this I had already tried , and failed , to obtain . No amount of explanation or argument seemed to change the Fon 's unhelpful attitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once it had occurred to him that the bed , together with one or two other pieces I was after , might be worth a considerable amount of money , he changed his tune . And though he suspected his counsellors might well be against him selling anything , he said he would be prepared to let us have the bed without even consulting them ? if the price was right . This , as he realised himself , was a risky thing to do . He knew perfectly well that his people might easily accuse him of betraying his trust . And he knew , too , that in their superstitious minds they might look upon such an act as a direct insult to their ancestors . And once the wrath of the ancients was invoked , who could guess what disastrous form of retribution might befall the people of Baba ? But to the Fon this was " old hat " ; and for the money he was prepared to risk their disapproval . 154 With most Fons I would have been reluctant to make any agreement on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind who had been disowned by half his tribe for having sold ancestral objects and had his palace burnt down in anger , I knew just how much trouble it could cause . But after discussing it with Pa Kisob , we both agreed that we could let , this cocksure Fon worry about this problem himself . At least he knew what he was doing , and was aware of the possible complications . So far as I was concerned , it was the bed I wanted to see preserved , not the Foil . So we finally sat down to the prolonged business of bargaining . The price he initially asked was ridiculous ; but finally we beat him down to a round figure of ? 75 for the bed and several other valuable pieces , and having counted out this sum in shillings , with the miserly chieftain checking every one to see if it was good , we went our way . I had an engagement in the museum at Abakpa the next day , so , as it was already getting late when we left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving John and Osula at the Ndop rest-house for the night . In the back of the Land Rover we had the Baba collection , and as we drove through the fading light Pa Kisob and I discussed the Fon , hoping that , for our sakes as well as his , his underhand sale of the bed would not lead to any tribal rift or other cataclysmic disaster . We were approaching the village of Babanki , having gone only about fifteen miles , when we were confronted with a roadside scene that had by now become familiar in the Cameroons ? a lorry , slewed across the road , up-ended in the ditch . The accident could only just have happened , for apart from one rather dazed man wandering about the road , and another lying groaning on the grass verge , there was no one else around . We jumped out , and ran over to the man on the ground . He was conscious , but he was obviously in considerable pain ; and it looked to me as though he might have broken his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment , so we cleared the " great bed of Baba " in the back of the Land Rover , and carefully lifted him on to it to take him into Bamenda . His dazed companion came with us , and as we bounced and jolted down the rough road , he sat in the back with the injured man keeping him as comfortable as possible on the hard wooden bed until we reached the hospital . As one does on these occasions , we felt a certain responsibility 155 for the man , having picked him up , and though the hospital staff now took over , we went inside to have a word with the doctor in case there was any other way in which we could help . The only things the doctor asked us were who he was , and where he came from . But as these were things we had n't bothered to find out by the roadside , he was now asked . There had , until that moment , been no possible connection between the lorry and Baba ; but as he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in disbelief , and let out a surprised " EH ! " " What 's wrong ? " I asked him . But Pa Kisob was obviously shaken , and for a moment he did n't reply . " Well ? Who is it ? " He turned to me with an ironic but rather frightened grin on his face . " It 's the Fon of Baba 's brother ! " " Oh Lord , " I thought . " The ancestors are taking their retribution ! Now what 's going to happen ? " But fortunately I think the wretched prince of Baba was far too preoccupied with pain to realise that he was the last of the Babas ever to rest his head upon the family bed . Had he done so , God knows what troubles might have stirred . We spent ten days in the rest-house at Ndop making a profitable haul ; but we had still barely scratched the surface of the Grasslands . Several people in Bamenda told me that I must at some time visit the Fon of Bum , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ' walk from the village of Fonfukka , about seventy miles north of Bamenda . According to Paul Gebauer , the Fon at one time had a fine collection of woodcarvings ; but his palace had been burnt down a year or so earlier , and no one in Bamenda knew what had become of the Bum sculpture . When we left Ndop , therefore , we planned an extensive tour of villages to the north of Bamenda that would bring us finally to Lagabum , the palace of the Fon of Bum . En route we would visit villages with fascinating names like We , Esu , Kuk , Za and Bu ; but of all those intermediate stops , those in which we ultimately made the most interesting collections were Isimbi and Wum . Isimbi was not , strictly speaking , on my beat . It lies in dense forest country similar to that we had visited on our journey to Bamenji , and its people are in no way related to the Grasslanders . But Bernard had asked me to go there if I found a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hitherto been , and nothing was therefore known of the Isimbi art ( if any existed ) . The people of Isimbi are by far the most primitive of any in the Southern Cameroons , and they had remained unadministered by the colonial government long after any other people in this region . Pa Kisob had been up there only once before , when he had accompanied the first administrative expedition as interpreter ; and now he was none too sure what sort of reception we would have . For , on that previous visit many years earlier the Isimbi had proved thoroughly hostile and had , in fact , only agreed to accept British rule under the threat of the rifle . To reach Isimbi we drove up the dusty road to Bafut ? and north to Mbelifang , where we branched off up a Land Rover track to a small village called Modelle about forty miles from Bamenda . Here we spent the night , and the following morning embarked on a half-day trek along the fringes of the Grasslands and into the dank , rain-sodden forests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way the trek was without excitement , and the scenery uninspiring . It had been pouring with rain the day before , and very soon we were soaked with moisture from the waist-high grass that . bent over the narrow , muddy , tracks . Then after about three hours we came to a broad river , beyond which the jungle-clad hills of Isimbi rose above us , their tops lost in a blanket of grey clouds . The river we had arrived at was the Menchem , one of the larger rivers of the Southern Cameroons that drains much of the western part of the Grasslands . We had been following it north the whole way from Bamenda , catching glimpses of it from the road as it poured down deep gorges on its journey to the Katsina and thence into the Benue and the Niger ; and often , as I had looked at it , I had wondered how we would get across it to reach Benakumu . It was twenty or thirty yards wide , and after the previous day 's rain it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmingly over hidden boulders . Any thought of wading it was absolutely out of the question ? one foot in it , and a man would have been whisked away to certain death . But now , as we approached it , I saw that there was a precarious liana suspension bridge stretching between two trees high above the water . The bridge was a rickety-looking affair with a four-inch wide causeway , and " handrails " on either side . But though it looked a bit primitive I felt sure it was safe , and I had no fears as I swung 157 myself up on to the tree to which it was attached , and jauntily started across . But I had never crossed a bridge of this sort before , and therefore did not know the hazards that are involved . The further I got out into the middle , the more the bridge began to swing from side to side , until when I was about half way across , it was swaying like a giant hammock in a gale . Then , suddenly . I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am one of those wretched people who suffer abominably from sea-sickness , vertigo , and any other malady that results from one 's sense of balance being disturbed . And to look down in the present circumstances was absolutely catastrophic . To the sensation of swinging was suddenly added the indescribably sick-making sight of the foaming brown water , gurgling and swirling fifteen feet below . Nothing was still ; and everything was moving in the wrong direction ? except me , who froze solid . But worse than that . Apart from being unable to move , I suddenly began to vomit violently , no doubt gravely polluting the drinking water for miles downstream . I was there for at least five minutes , before being able to take another step ; but , having to move one way or the other , I eventually forced myself to creep slowly across to the far side . I thought that such ridiculous effects would probably be experienced only by mollycoddled Europeans such as myself . But when we were all across , we witnessed a very peculiar spectacle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were born but for flimsy grass G-strings , had gathered on the far bank , with huge baskets of bananas on their backs that they were taking across to the market at Modelle . Amongst these was a girl of about nineteen or twenty , who must surely have had to cross the Menchem many times before in her life . But now , suddenly ? perhaps having watched me in difficulties ? she positively refused to go . Despite all efforts of older women to get her on to the bridge , she just stood at the end screaming her head off in terror . This extraordinary spectacle went on for some time , until eventually one of the other women had to carry her across pick-a-back . This looked far more frightening than going across alone ; and the screaming did not stop until she was safely landed the other side . Having crossed the Menchem we trekked through the forests towards Benakumu , passing straggling groups of people on their way down to Modelle . Most of these were women , such as we had seen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who caught 158 my eye on account of the strange load slung over his shoulders . This was a bundle consisting of a dozen ancient-looking iron machete blades , which , to judge from their appearance , had never been intended for normal use . It turned out that they were , in fact , money to be used for the same purpose as the heavy-bladed spears that I had collected in the Congo ? for payment of bride-price . Pa Kisob and I tried for some time to buy the bundle from the boy . But the acquisition of a buxom little Isimbi sweetheart obviously surpassed any interest in silver shillings , and our efforts were in vain . Though Benekumu featured in heavy black letters on my map of the Cameroons , it turned out to be a tiny village of dilapidated grass huts ? one of the most primitive of any I had seen . Nevertheless , the Isimbi chief was a " shorts and shirt " man who , unlike most of his fellow tribesmen , had been to Bamenda several times , and who had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Government . Just what he had done to warrant Government praise I did not discover ; but it meant that he was at that time particularly well disposed towards the British , and I was welcomed into his hut for a horn of filthy beer . By no stretch of the imagination could the Isimbi people be called artistic , and though we did not go away empty-handed , I could see from the start that Benakumu was no treasure-house of antiquities . Being so close to Bamenda and the Grassland tribes , this total lack of artistry was surprising . But frequently in Africa I am astonished at the illogicality and unpredictability of the patterns of culture contact and the spread of ideas from one tribe to the next . Mostly one finds that ideas ( and art styles ) have spread to some extent across tribal barriers . At Bamenji we saw how the Widekum people use Bamileke artwork ; and all along the western fringe of the Grasslands the art styles mingle with those of the Cross river tribes in the forests to the west . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with movement of peoples . One can , for instance , detect striking similarities in certain art objects of the Bushongo , a thousand miles to the southeast , to those of the Grasslands . Sometimes , indeed , one can trace influence even further . Iron gongs of the Kwifon type have been found in Southern Rhodesia , nearly two thousand five hundred miles away . Yet in this corner of the Cameroons , it might appear that the primitive people of Isimbi had never heard of their 159 Weeks later when I had returned to London I received the following letter written by the Chief 's Secretary : Chief Ngah of Magha , Aghem-Wum Division Bamenda Province , Southern British Cameroons . Mr. Robert Dick Read , ( Written by Chief 's Secretary ) 29 Montpelier Place , London , S.W.7 . My friend , I refer to your letter which was received here and all the contents were quite understood and the enclosure was also seen . I was very glad to see that , you reached your home and still remember me . I thanked you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope to visit Bamenda as you mentioned in your above mentioned letter , to see what you have done for Bamenda and the Cameroons . I should be grateful if you would kindly send to me an empty tin of Ilford F.P. Film just as the empty one you gave me in my Palace . I should wish to have two or three . Your kind action would be appreciated . I trust I shall be happy of your meeting again when you next visit Wum . May God be with you ? and families Yours very sincerely , Chief Ngah of Magha . From Wum we went on to We , and from We to Esu without incident . Then cutting back from Esu to We we joined the main road that took us past Kumfulu and Fungom to Fonfukka . Here we left the car , and Pa Kisob , Osula , John and I , with a local boy to guide us , set off into the hills by foot for Lagabum , the seat of the Fon of Bum . The walk was delightful , paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lichens and mosses hanging from the trees , and out over rolling down-like hills spread with a vivid green carpet of thick tufted grass . On the hill-tops an occasional outcrop of rock broke through like a miniature Dartmoor Tor , and in the valleys the ground underfoot squelched and sprang like a 162 Connemara bog . The shape of the land , and the vegetation , differed radically from the highlands that I had known in Eastern and Southern Africa , and it was hard to believe we were within a few miles of the steaming Guinea coast jungles , and the fever-ridden swamps of the Niger Delta . As we climbed higher , the view across the seemingly endless Grasslands became more and more impressive . Finally we reached Lagabum , and , unannounced , we wandered into the courtyard of the Fon 's palace , which stood alone in splendid isolation high in the hills . The Fon of Bum was a rotund , jovial character , who appeared delighted to see us . Like the Fon of Bali , he had once been in England , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand on ceremony , and in his presence we immediately felt that we could relax . When we were all seated comfortably on the verandah of the " palace " , the Fon called one of his wives , and sent her off to brew a pot of tea . This was brought in on a cheap tin tray , with a plateful of Dad 's Cookies ? an unexpected luxury so far from home . Now , as we sat round sipping our tea in a terribly English manner , other servants were sent off on different errands . One came back with an enormous bowl of maize meal , enough food for Osula , John , and the guide to live on for a week . Another came back with a ram , a chicken and a dozen eggs for me , which , having been presented , were handed over to John for him to deal with . ( We slaughtered the ram for dinner ; and the chicken we took home . ) After tea I was shown to my room , which , to my amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the walls , and rush matting on the floor and ceiling . It was furnished with an iron bedstead on which was a mattress , and blankets from Fortnum and Mason ; and in the corner was a fulllength zinc bath , and a Victorian washstand with a bowl and jug of water . Lagabum , a thatched paradise high in the cool dew-laden hills , lent itself to the sort , of idyllic existence that the Fon obviously enjoyed . He himself was a strange character , something of a mystic and a poet at heart , contented with his isolation , but frustrated by his responsibilities . The gentler things in life held more appeal for him than the problems of power and authority . Generosity and hospitality came naturally to him , and though during our short stay he gave us much , he asked for nothing in return ? except that , when we left , I should take his radio back to Bamenda to be repaired , 163 and that when I returned to London I should buy him an inexpensive telescope . Regrettably ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his old palace had been burned down , not a single piece from among his woodcarvings had been saved . Now the only ancestral relics with which he was left were a few beaded gourds , and a fine bronze pipe made up of a composite design of frogs , a cow 's head , and a human face . But among the Fon 's worldly possessions there was one thing of which he was inordinately proud . This was his herd of dwarf cattle . These curious little creatures , Bos brachyceros , came originally from Egypt to West Africa thousands of years ago , and have long been highly valued by the noblemen and kings of the Cameroons . In appearance they are not unlike miniature Friesians , three feet high at the shoulders , and they are valued more for their horns than for their creamy milk . Horns of every shape and size are used in the Cameroons for drinking . Anyone going on a journey will carry with him his horn for a draught of palm-wine in a roadside hamlet when he is thirsty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , indeed , one of the greatest status symbols of the country . When , later , I visited the people of Nsaw , I was invited to become a member of their Mandjong society , in the old days a society of warriors , but today little more than a hunting and drinking club . However , it was forbidden for me to enter the Mandjong house until first I had acquired a sword and scabbard to wear round my waist , and a horn from which to drink . In my experience , though there were many horns around , they were among the most difficult things to buy . Frequently they had been handed down from father to son for generations , and people would rather have gone naked than part with their horns . The most commonly used horns are those of ordinary domestic cattle , 164 often finely carved ; but in my collection in the museum I had others made from buffalo , water-buck and kudu . Some were not even made of " horn " . I had several made of pottery ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet another made from the hornshaped tip of a calabash ; and one of the best I collected was entirely encased in an elaborate covering of beads . But the finest and most prized of all drinking horns are those of the dwarf cattle . In the olden days , these were considered of such great value that one such horn might change hands for two slaves ; and even today , if anyone is willing to part with one , their value is over ? 10 . The Fon 's dwarf herd consisted of six cows and a bull ? or thirteen living horns , for one was broken ? and these creatures were more dear to him than anything else he possessed . I asked him if I might see them , and no request could have pleased him more . He immediately gave instructions for the herd to be rounded up and brought into the palace yard . We waited almost half an hour , but still there was no sign of them . The Fon asked what was happening and was told that the cows had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come out . Several servants were sent to help the herd-boys and we could hear them all shouting and beating the bushes , but the cows defied all efforts to round them up ? until finally the Fon himself went out . This rotund , Farmer Giles-like figure , in his long embroidered robes made a comic sight as he stood at the edge of the copse calling to each of his cows by name like a small child calling a litter of reluctant puppies . I was sceptical that he could achieve anything after eight stick-wielding servants had failed to drive them out ; but suddenly , one by one , the cows came straggling through the trees , and followed the Fon obediently back to the palace . Here , with evident pride and pleasure , he fed each of them a Dad 's Cookie , and allowed them to lick him to their hearts ' content . The Fon , it seemed , was the only person of whom the cows took any notice at any time . Before we left Bum the next day , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our collection . I tried also to persuade him to let us take care of his bronze pipe for him , but as this was almost his last ancestral piece , and as it was bronze and therefore not easily destroyed , I did not press him too hard , and he preferred to keep it . I have mentioned several bronze pieces that we found in the 165 Cameroons . The art of bronze casting in West Africa is usually associated with the famous city of Benin , and the more ancient city of Ife in Western Nigeria . Bronze casting , however , was practised throughout the Guinea coast at one time , from the Cote d'Ivoire in the west , to the Gabon just north of the Congo river . The method of casting used in West Africa is called " cire perdue " or " lost wax " , and is the same as that practised in the European Bronze Age , and in ancient Egypt , India , China and Peru . Some of the casters in West Africa achieved an astonishing degree of technical skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures nearly three feet tall and others made long before Europeans came to Africa are only about a millimetre in thickness throughout . The Cameroons was never particularly famous for its bronze work , although the art was doubtless practised there for a good many years , until modern times . So far as I could discover there was only one small group of craftsmen ( who worked in brass rather than bronze ) still in existence ; and they were living and working just outside Bamenda . So , soon after I returned from Bum , I went to watch them at work . They worked as a team , and their products were extremely rough , being produced these days essentially for tourists . When I arrived they were making pipes . In one corner of the workshop two young boys were making models in clay , roughly the shape of the pipe-bowls ultimately to be produced . Over each " core " , as the rough model is called , the master-craftsman moulded a thin layer of beeswax , in which , with a variety of small knives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case , an elephant 's head . When this was done the core with its wax overlay was moved on to the next stage . Here , another craftsman painted it with several layers of liquid clay ? liquid so as to run into every cranny ? thus making a precise cast of the wax image . Now , one or two nails were driven right through the wax into the central core , to hold it firmly in place when the wax was later melted out . Before the " slip " was completely dry more clay was applied , until the whole piece was entirely encased in a large ball of clay , except for two holes at the bottom from which two rods of beeswax protruded from the wax pipe inside . Now the whole thing was fired , and as it grew hot the wax melted and ran out , leaving a cavity inside , the shape of the pipe ; and into this cavity was poured molten brass heated to a temperature of about 1150 degrees centigrade . When the casting 166 had cooled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the interior core scraped out , leaving the finished brass pipe identical to the wax model . In the olden days the craftsmen would have had to do no more than file away the " rods " that had formed the channels through which the metal was poured , such was their skill . But today , with castings being turned out cheaply and quickly with little heed to the finer details , they were more often than not rough and in need of a considerable amount of work with a file before being put on sale . In parts of West Africa ( Ashanti in Ghana ) there was an amusing variation on the " lost wax " theme , which has become known as the " lost beetle " process . In this , a dead beetle , or any other natural combustible object , was used instead of the wax image . Having been encased in clay , the beetle was then burnt out at a very high temperature leaving a beetle-shaped cavity into which the metal was poured just as in the lost wax casting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , at any time , was the manufacture of a complete set of type for a printing press to print an indigenous African form of writing . The criticism often heard , that Africans never had a written language of their own , is by no means true . Had it not been that Europeans colonised Africa when they did , written African languages might well be in widespread use by now . But sadly for Africa , those that did exist before Europeans arrived with the presses and more advanced form of writing were nipped in the bud hardly before they had had a chance to become established . Two such written languages existed before the beginning of the colonial era ; that of the Vai tribe in Liberia ; and that of one of the greatest of the Grassland tribes , the Barnum , who at the time of my visit lived in what was then the French Cameroons . Though the Barnum themselves freely admit that the original idea of writing came from the Arab world ? several Muslim books having been brought to their country by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabic or any other type of writing . The man responsible for the Barnum script was their extraordinary young King , Njoya , who is said to have received the initial inspiration in a dream . This was in 1895 , six years before the first Europeans came to Barnum . In his dream he was told to call together all his noblemen and courtiers and get each of them to 167 design a series of symbols to represent different words and ideas . From the symbols thus amassed he then himself devised the first Barnum " alphabet " , known to his people as " the Book " . The " Book " consisted of 510 symbols ( including ten numerals ) , many of which had fairly obvious meanings , being pictographic or ideographic . A few examples are shown in the illustration . Over the next twenty years Njoya set out to simplify " the Book " , producing altogether seven versions ; the one that finally came into general use being known as the " New Alphabet " . In this , the pictographic and ideographic aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system in which each symbol represented a sound . This from every point of view , was a far more advanced type of script , though strictly speaking it was a syllabary rather than an alphabet . It consisted of over eighty characters and is shown in the illustration . 168 King Njoya himself taught the writing in schools set up specially for the purpose . The materials used originally consisted of wooden boards or specially prepared bark on which the characters were written in charcoal or ink made from a liana . In the early days it was used mainly for recording court cases , or sending messages ; but at about the time that the Germans occupied Barnum the first of several major works made its appearance . This was the Complete History and Customs of the Barnum , written on cheap lined paper purchased from the first German trader in the area , which ran to 1190 pages in the Royal edition . The " History " was followed by a book on Barnum religion , and a highly popular best-seller on tribal medicine and pharmacopoeia . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the Palace seems to cover about onetenth of the whole area ! In 1913 Njoya had an idea that might have had resounding consequences ; he decided to set up a Barnum printing press of his own . Calling in his master bronze-caster , a poor man named Monliper Njimonjap , experiments were made until perfect type could be cast in the cire perdue method . And Monliper got to work on a project that was to take him seven long years to complete . In 1920 all was ready for the production of the first Barnum printed book , in their own language , with their own type , and on a press designed by themselves . But alas , at that time , Njoya , a temperamental genius , was in the throes of dreadful arguments with the post-war French administration . These troubles had put Njoya into a mood of deep depression . And one day , suddenly bursting into a fit of uncontrollable anger , the King descended upon poor Monliper 's workshop and callously destroyed the press , the 169 type , and seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a feat of invention unequalled in the history of the African continent : one that , had it come a hundred years earlier , might well have flowered and spread far and wide . The Barnum script , handwritten , remained in use for many years , until after the second world war . But today , if it has not died completely , it is nearly forgotten , having been superseded by the roman alphabet . For ten weeks , with Osula , John , and one or other of the interpreters , I roamed the Cameroons , sometimes driving to villages , sometimes trekking for hours or even days over the open rolling hills to visit a distant palace or hamlet . Wherever we went we were greeted as equals and treated accordingly by the refreshingly easygoing country people . " Hallo Whiteman ! " the children would call with unselfconscious recognition of our differences ; and giggle with delight when I called back to them " Hallo Blackboys ! " ? words which would cause a riot in the befuddled lands of Kenya or Rhodesia . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes massive celebrations with dancing and drinking , presided over by the Fon . Only rarely were there difficulties , as at Baba , though sometimes we had to pay heavily for objects of special value . On the other hand Fons , either naturally generous or valuing the prestige to be gained from such a move , sometimes gave or lent things to the museum with no financial inducement . At the end of this period we had over four hundred pieces large and small , piled up in the Community Hall at Abakpa . And now began the tedious business of documenting , numbering , and photographing each piece , and finally setting up the display . Bearing in mind that we were making this museum for the people of the Cameroons ? a Folk Museum ? I wanted to display as large and representative a selection of pieces as possible . But obviously it was not possible to show everything , and boxes had to be specially constructed in which to store the remainder . Often while I was setting the museum up I found myself marvelling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any single village or palace this variety was not always apparent , when everything was collected together it was clear that the material culture of these African people had , in the past , been quite as complex as that of rural Europe in the nineteenth century and a good deal more grandiose . 170
