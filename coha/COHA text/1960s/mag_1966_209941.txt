The winner will face a stiff fight from a strong Republican Party , which is expected to unite behind its own bitter-end segregationist , Freshman Representative James Martin , 47 . Martin , who entered politics in 1962 , came within 6,800 votes of winning Veteran Lister Hill 's U.S. Senate seat in that year by campaigning on the integration issue and his " perfect 13-year attendance record " at Kiwanis Club meetings .
