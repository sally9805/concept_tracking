In Scottsdale , near Phoenix , Ariz. , one day last week , a trailer-towing car tooled into the Oasis Mobile Home Park . The driver and his wife gazed appreciatively at the neat flower beds and the swimming pool , the recreation hall and the nine-hole putting green , the croquet court and the three shuffleboard courts . The weekly schedule of activities , posted by the " sunshine girl " or social director , revealed plans for potluck dinner , pinochle games , bridge night , dancing , and classes in ceramics and art . The well-fitted trailers-preferably called mobile homes-were leashed to water lines and TV lines , phone lines and plumbing lines ( no clotheslines , thanks to built-in washers and dryers ) . Most of them were attached to cabanas and ramadas ( a kind of carport ) . Some were three-bedroom affairs . All had living rooms and fully equipped kitchens . All had wheels that were decorously hidden behind shrubbery , brick walls , or flowers . <P> Suitably impressed , the visitor and his wife , a couple in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office about rates . Watching the newcomers from his little garden , Trailerite Mack Gottschalk sighed with satisfaction . " It 's a trailerite 's heaven , " said he . " When a trailerite dies , he 'd like to come to something like this . " <P> Nice Folks . It takes a heap o ' claustrophilia to make a trailer a home , but more than 3,500,000 Americans are addicted to what they fondly call Wheel Estate . There are nearly 1,500,000 trailers on the road or lodged at some 18,500 parks in the U.S. , and trailer living has gotten so popular that Michigan State University offers degrees in trailering ( engineering , design , park management , etc . ) . It used to be that trailer living was the sole preserve of the unwanted and the rootless . Today , although trailerites have their share of spoilsports , mobile home promoters eagerly point out that most trailer people are nice folks : servicemen , vacationers , professional people and retired couples . <P> Though their parks are scattered in all 50 states , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Texas , Arizona and California . But climate alone is not enough to lure the trailerites . Many are like the Lawrence Traylors , in their late 50s , who got lonely living in an apartment where " we could live and die , and nobody would care . " So the Traylors moved to Mobile Manor in Arcadia , Calif. , where they found " country-club living " in a handsomely furnished trailer ( with color TV ) and in the gregarious camaraderie that is the chief feature of trailer parks everywhere .
