txt Mayor Lindsay asked the City Council yesterday to give him emergency powers to ban the sale of firearms and alcoholic beverages and to impose a curfew in outbreaks of civil disorder . The legislation sent to the Council by the Mayor would empower him to declare a state of emergency , either citywide or in a specified area , upon written certification by the city 's Emergency Control Board . The board is made up of high city officials , including the Police and Fire Commissioners and is headed by the Mayor . The bill would also empower the Mayor to close theaters and other places normally used for public entertainment and prohibit vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the emergency area , except for emergency services . The emergency would be in force for 15 days , a period that the Mayor could reduce or extend . Violators of emergency measures would be subject to fines up to $500 , one-year jail sentences , or both . It was indicated that the Mayor 's legislation would be rushed to a public hearing and a decision by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview , Majority Leader David Ross , Bronx Democrat . would not predict that , the Republican Mayor 's bill would he enacted . But he said , he personally had no objection to the proposed legislation . " I would find it difficult , " 1 Mr. Ross said , " to oppose legislation which is directed at a riot-type situation . " By coincidence , the Mayor 's emergency riot-control proposals were introduced on a day when the Cit : , Council became involved in an impassioned discussion of the causes of crime and civil disorders in the ghettos . The argument was sparked by a debate over a $2.2-million budget allocation to add 710 patrolmen to the city 's police force and 300 additional trainees to be assigned at the ' outset to traffic work , freeing ; an equal number of policemen ' for patrol duty . The funds were approved unanimously . The expansion of , the police force was part of a broad anticrime program an- , nounced by Mayor Lindsay last Jan. 27 . The principal antagonists in the debate were Councilman ' Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Manhattan Democrat . Deploring the high incidence of crime in the city , Mr. Modugno criticized the recent report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders , ' of which Mayor Lindsay was vice chairman . The Councilman said the report blamed " white racists " for civil disorders . " while no mention is made of the actual perpetrators of last summer 's riots . " Mr. Jones . gray-haired and heavy-set , slowly rose in his scat and looked toward Mr. Modugno across a sea of desks . " I am sorry , " Mr. Jones said , ' " that you do not know the history of the Negro in America . The white racists were not ' the thrust of that report . The ' report has tried to bring home to white America that there is a festering sore that has last , ed for 200 years . " All the report is asking , " the Harlem Councilman went on , " is that Americans re-examine and re-evaluate themselves and that perhaps both groups can manage together to work for a greater America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he regretted that a discusIsion of money for additional policemen had turned into what I he termed an " emotional " debate over civil rights . ' " What 's wrong in this ( country today , " Mr. Ross dedared , " is that only the extremists are heard . I pray that this Council will take the leadership in rejecting extremism on both sides of the civil ' rights argument . " Mayor Lindsay said his bill ' had been prepared by his Criminal Justice Coordinating Council and followed recommendations of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders . The Mayor said New York had been " fortunate in avoidling any civil disorders for the past two summers , during a ' period that has witnessed a ' succession of outbreaks of violence in cities across the ' nation ? 56 during 1967 . " For this hot-weather peace , the Mayor credited " the intense dedication and labor of hundreds of people working ' not only during the summer months , but year-'round . " As we approach the summer of 1968 , " Mr. Lindsay said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , greater ' energy , greater imagination ' and greater numbers of people , involved than ever before in ' , the city 's history .
