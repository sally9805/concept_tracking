It was a typical Sunday in the New York Times . The lead editorial urged limitation of U.S. forces in Viet Nam and endorsed the idea of " an interim national government acceptable to both sides . " Columnist James Reston , also questioning U.S. policy in Viet Nam , brooded over the " gap between the evangelical rhetoric of official Washington and the political realities of the world . " The lead letter in the letters-to-the-editor column , written by an assistant professor of humanities , excoriated the U.S. Government for its " blind antiCommunism " and detected a " nascent war psychosis " in the American public . <P> Standing alone on the Times editorial page was Columnist Cyrus L. Sulzberger . He took a firm stand against " flabbiness in Viet Nam " and reminded all concerned that the U.S. " inherited the position of global superpower in 1945 and can not escape its obligations . " He recalled that " the 1947 Greek commitment under the Truman Doctrine was also originally unpopular . Many naive Americans and their newspapers then preferred the Communist rebels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man delivering an urgent warning to his friends , he wrote : " If we crawl out of Viet Nam now , it is obvious that Southeast Asia right down to Australia will join our adversaries and that India will be outflanked . " <P> Debating the Debate . This pattern of dissent by a Times columnist is not necessarily unique . Arthur Krock differs from the paper 's policy on some issues , notably economics ; Hanson Baldwin tends to differ on military policy . However , it is Sulzberger 's independent line on Viet Nam that has become more and more conspicuous in recent months . <P> Times editorialists have long argued against a major U.S. commitment in Viet Nam. * The general Times approach comes under the guidance of Arthur Ochs ( " Punch " ) Sulzberger , the publisher , who is Cy 's first cousin , and John B. Oakes , editor of the editorial page , who is also a member of the Times family hierarchy . It is no secret that the Times editorial line on Viet Nam does not meet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the continuing debate is Cy Sulzberger 's consistent disagreement with his paper . <P> Last April the Times editorialized : " President Johnson 's offer of ' unconditional discussions ' was a splendid move on the diplomatic/political front , in the effort to achieve a peaceful solution of the quarrel . " Sulzberger dissented : " It is fair to ask why Mr. Johnson chose this moment seemingly to alter a Viet Nam strategy that had but recently become more resolute . Waving a carrot may be seen by our adversaries as a sign of weakness . " Times editorials have consistently called for deescalation : " What the U.S. is doing in Viet Nam is playing directly into the hands of Communist China by taking actions that lead to a steadily escalating , more dangerous , conflict . " Sulzberger has disagreed : " This is admittedly a dangerous game , an experiment in gradual escalation . Yet the blank refusal of Peking or Hanoi to consider any negotiated settlement eliminates any other alternative save a disastrous withdrawal which we can not contemplate .
