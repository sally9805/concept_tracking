The DELEGATE FROM VENUS By HENRY SLESAR ILLUSTRATOR NOVICK Everybody was waiting to see what the delegate from Venus looked like . And all they got for their patience was the biggest surprise since David clobbered Goliath . " Let me put it this way , " Conners said paternally . " We expect a certain amount of decorum from our Washington news correspondents , and that 's all I 'm asking for . " Jerry Bridges , sitting in the chair opposite his employer 's desk , chewed on his knuckles and said nothing . One part of his mind wanted him to play it cagey , to behave the way the newspaper wanted him to behave , to protect the cozy Washington assignment he had waited four years to get . But another part of him , a rebel part , wanted him to stay on the trail of the story he felt sure was about to break . Illustration : The saucer was interesting , but where was the delegate ? " I did n't mean to make trouble , Mr. Conners , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these exchanges of couriers in the past two days . I could n't help thinking something was up . " " Even if that 's true , we 'll hear about it through the usual channels , " Conners frowned . " But getting a senator 's secretary drunk to obtain information  --  well , that 's not only indiscreet , Bridges . It 's downright dirty . " Jerry grinned . " I did n't take that kind of advantage , Mr. Conners . Not that she was n't a toothsome little dish ... " " Just thank your lucky stars that it did n't go any further . And from now on  --  " He waggled a finger at him . " Watch your step . " Jerry got up and ambled to the door . But he turned before leaving and said : " By the way . What do you think is going on ? " " I have n't the faintest idea . " " Do n't kid me , Mr. Conners . Think it 's war ? " " That 'll be all , Bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door behind him , and then strolled out of the building into the sunlight . He met Ruskin , the fat little AP correspondent , in front of the Pan-American Building on Constitution Avenue . Ruskin was holding the newspaper that contained the gossip-column item which had started the whole affair , and he seemed more interested in the romantic rather than political implications . As he walked beside him , he said : " So what really happened , pal ? That Greta babe really let down her hair ? " " Where 's your decorum ? " Jerry growled . Ruskin giggled . " Boy , she 's quite a dame , all right . I think they ought to get the Secret Service to guard her . She really fills out a size 10 , do n't she ? " " Ruskin , " Jerry said , " you have a low mind . For a week , this town has been acting like the 39 Steps , and all you can think about is dames . What 's the matter with you ? Where will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Greta , I hope , " Ruskin sighed . " What a way to get radioactive . " They split off a few blocks later , and Jerry walked until he came to the Red Tape Bar &amp; Grill , a favorite hangout of the local journalists . There were three other newsmen at the bar , and they gave him snickering greetings . He took a small table in the rear and ate his meal in sullen silence . It was n't the newsmen 's jibes that bothered him ; it was the certainty that something of major importance was happening in the capitol . There had been hourly conferences at the White House , flying visits by State Department officials , mysterious conferences involving members of the Science Commission . So far , the byword had been secrecy . They knew that Senator Spocker , chairman of the Congressional Science Committee , had been involved in every meeting , but Senator Spocker was unavailable . His secretary , however , was a little more obliging ... Jerry looked up from his coffee and blinked when he saw who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So did every other patron , but for different reasons . Greta Johnson had that effect upon men . Even the confining effect of a mannishly-tailored suit did n't hide her outrageously feminine qualities . She walked straight to his table , and he stood up . " They told me you might be here , " she said , breathing hard . " I just wanted to thank you for last night . " " Look , Greta  --  " Wham ! Her hand , small and delicate , felt like a slab of lead when it slammed into his cheek . She left a bruise five fingers wide , and then turned and stalked out . * * * * * He ran after her , the restaurant proprietor shouting about the unpaid bill . It took a rapid dog-trot to reach her side . " Greta , listen ! " he panted . " You do n't understand about last night . It was n't the way that lousy columnist said  --  " She stopped in her tracks . " I would n't have minded so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , just to get a story  --  " " But I 'm a reporter , damn it . It 's my job . I 'd do it again if I thought you knew anything . " She was pouting now . " Well , how do you suppose I feel , knowing you 're only interested in me because of the Senator ? Anyway , I 'll probably lose my job , and then you wo n't have any use for me . " " Good-bye , Greta , " Jerry said sadly . " What ? " " Good-bye . I suppose you wo n't want to see me any more . " " Did I say that ? " " It just wo n't be any use . We 'll always have this thing between us . " She looked at him for a moment , and then touched his bruised cheek with a tender , motherly gesture . " Your poor face , " she murmured , and then sighed . " Oh , well . I guess there 's no use fighting it . Maybe if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act human again . " " Greta ! " " But if you print one word of it , Jerry Bridges , I 'll never speak to you again ! " " Honey , " Jerry said , taking her arm , " you can trust me like a brother . " " That 's not the idea , " Greta said stiffly . In a secluded booth at the rear of a restaurant unfrequented by newsmen , Greta leaned forward and said : " At first , they thought it was another sputnik . " " Who did ? " " The State Department , silly . They got reports from the observatories about another sputnik being launched by the Russians . Only the Russians denied it . Then there were joint meetings , and nobody could figure out what the damn thing was . " " Wait a minute , " Jerry said dizzily . " You mean to tell me there 's another of those metal moons up there ? " " But it 's not a moon . That 's the big point . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaceship , " Greta said coolly , sipping lemonade . " They have been in contact with it now for about three days , and they 're thinking of calling a plenary session of the UN just to figure out what to do about it . The only hitch is , Russia does n't want to wait that long , and is asking for a hurry-up summit meeting to make a decision . " " A decision about what ? " " About the Venusians , of course . " " Greta , " Jerry said mildly , " I think you 're still a little woozy from last night . " " Do n't be silly . The spaceship 's from Venus ; they 've already established that . And the people on it  --  I guess they 're people  --  want to know if they can land their delegate . " " Their what ? " " Their delegate . They came here for some kind of conference , I guess . They know about the UN and everything , and they want to take part . They say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs are their affairs , too . It 's kind of confusing , but that 's what they say . " " You mean these Venusians speak English ? " " And Russian . And French . And German . And everything I guess . They 've been having radio talks with practically every country for the past three days . Like I say , they want to establish diplomatic relations or something . The Senator thinks that if we do n't agree , they might do something drastic , like blow us all up . It 's kind of scary . " She shivered delicately . " You 're taking it mighty calm , " he said ironically . " Well , how else can I take it ? I 'm not even supposed to know about it , except that the Senator is so careless about  --  " She put her fingers to her lips . " Oh , dear , now you 'll really think I 'm terrible . " " Terrible ? I think you 're wonderful ! " " And you promise not to print it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Y-e-s . But you know , you 're a liar sometimes , Jerry . I 've noticed that about you . " * * * * * The press secretary 's secretary , a massive woman with gray hair and impervious to charm , guarded the portals of his office with all the indomitable will of the U. S. Marines . But Jerry Bridges tried . " You do n't understand , Lana , " he said . " I do n't want to see Mr. Howells . I just want you to give him something . " " My name 's not Lana , and I ca n't deliver any messages . " " But this is something he wants to see . " He handed her an envelope , stamped URGENT . " Do it for me , Hedy . And I 'll buy you the flashiest pair of diamond earrings in Washington . " " Well , " the woman said , thawing slightly . " I could deliver it with his next batch of mail . " " When will that be ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important meeting right now . " " You 've got some mail right there . Earrings and a bracelet to match . " She looked at him with exasperation , and then gathered up a stack of memorandums and letters , his own envelope atop it . She came out of the press secretary 's office two minutes later with Howells himself , and Howells said : " You there , Bridges . Come in here . " " Yes , sir ! " Jerry said , breezing by the waiting reporters with a grin of triumph . There were six men in the room , three in military uniform . Howells poked the envelope towards Jerry , and snapped : " This note of yours . Just what do you think it means ? " " You know better than I do , Mr. Howells . I 'm just doing my job ; I think the public has a right to know about this spaceship that 's flying around  --  " * * * * * His words brought an exclamation from the others . Howells sighed , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy for us . It 's our opinion that secrecy is essential , that leakage of the story might cause panic . Since you 're the only unauthorized person who knows of it , we have two choices . One of them is to lock you up . " Jerry swallowed hard . " The other is perhaps more practical , " Howells said . " You 'll be taken into our confidence , and allowed to accompany those officials who will be admitted to the landing site . But you will not be allowed to relay the story to the press until such a time as all correspondents are informed . That wo n't give you a ' scoop ' if that 's what you call it , but you 'll be an eyewitness . That should be worth something . " " It 's worth a lot , " Jerry said eagerly . " Thanks , Mr. Howells . " " Do n't thank me , I 'm not doing you any personal favor . Now about the landing tonight  --  " " You mean the spaceship 's coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference was held this morning , and a decision was reached to accept the delegate . Landing instructions are being given at Los Alamos , and the ship will presumably land around midnight tonight . There will be a jet leaving Washington Airport at nine , and you 'll be on it . Meanwhile , consider yourself in custody . " * * * * * The USAF jet transport was n't the only secrecy-shrouded aircraft that took off that evening from Washington Airport . But Jerry Bridges , sitting in the rear seat flanked by two Sphinx-like Secret Service men , knew that he was the only passenger with non-official status aboard . It was only a few minutes past ten when they arrived at the air base at Los Alamos . The desert sky was cloudy and starless , and powerful searchlights probed the thick cumulus . There were sleek , purring black autos waiting to rush the air passengers to some unnamed destination . They drove for twenty minutes across a flat ribbon of desert road , until Jerry sighted what appeared to be a circle of newly-erected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , official vehicles were parked in orderly rows , and four USAF trailer trucks were in evidence , their radarscopes turning slowly . There was activity everywhere , but it was well-ordered and unhurried . They had done a good job of keeping the excitement contained . He was allowed to leave the car and stroll unescorted . He tried to talk to some of the scurrying officials , but to no avail . Finally , he contented himself by sitting on the sand , his back against the grill of a staff car , smoking one cigarette after another . As the minutes ticked off , the activity became more frenetic around him . Then the pace slowed , and he knew the appointed moment was approaching . Stillness returned to the desert , and tension was a tangible substance in the night air . The radarscopes spun slowly . The searchlights converged in an intricate pattern . Then the clouds seemed to part ! " Here she comes ! " a voice shouted . And in a moment , the calm was shattered . At first , he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it became a growl that increased in volume until even the shouting voices could no longer be heard . Then the crisscrossing lights struck metal , glancing off the gleaming body of a descending object . Larger and larger the object grew , until it assumed the definable shape of a squat silver funnel , falling in a perfect straight line towards the center of the light-ringed area . When it hit , a dust cloud obscured it from sight . * * * * * A loudspeaker blared out an unintelligible order , but its message was clear . No one moved from their position . Finally , a three-man team , asbestos-clad , lead-shielded , stepped out from the ring of spectators . They carried geiger counters on long poles before them . Jerry held his breath as they approached the object ; only when they were yards away did he appreciate its size . It was n't large ; not more than fifteen feet in total circumference . One of the three men waved a gloved hand . " It 's okay , " a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ring of spectators closed tighter . They were twenty yards from the ship when the voice spoke to them . " Greetings from Venus , " it said , and then repeated the phrase in six languages . " The ship you see is a Venusian Class 7 interplanetary rocket , built for one-passenger . It is clear of all radiation , and is perfectly safe to approach . There is a hatch which may be opened by an automatic lever in the side . Please open this hatch and remove the passenger . " An Air Force General whom Jerry could n't identify stepped forward . He circled the ship warily , and then said something to the others . They came closer , and he touched a small lever on the silvery surface of the funnel . A door slid open . " It 's a box ! " someone said . " A crate  --  " " Colligan ! Moore ! Schaffer ! Lend a hand here  --  " A trio came forward and hoisted the crate out of the ship . Then the voice spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the decreased load of the ship . " Please open the crate . You will find our delegate within . We trust you will treat him with the courtesy of an official emissary . " They set to work on the crate , its gray plastic material giving in readily to the application of their tools . But when it was opened , they stood aside in amazement and consternation . There were a variety of metal pieces packed within , protected by a filmy packing material . " Wait a minute , " the general said . " Here 's a book  --  " He picked up a gray-bound volume , and opened its cover . " ' Instructions for assembling Delegate , ' " he read aloud . " ' First , remove all parts and arrange them in the following order . A-1 , central nervous system housing . A-2 ... ' " He looked up . " It 's an instruction book , " he whispered . " We 're supposed to build the damn thing . " * * * * * The Delegate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieced together some three hours later , by a team of scientists and engineers who seemed to find the Venusian instructions as elementary as a blueprint in an Erector set . But simple as the job was , they were obviously impressed by the mechanism they had assembled . It stood impassive until they obeyed the final instruction . " Press Button K ... " They found button K , and pressed it . The robot bowed . " Thank you , gentlemen , " it said , in sweet , unmetallic accents . " Now if you will please escort me to the meeting place ... " * * * * * It was n't until three days after the landing that Jerry Bridges saw the Delegate again . Along with a dozen assorted government officials , Army officers , and scientists , he was quartered in a quonset hut in Fort Dix , New Jersey . Then , after seventy-two frustrating hours , he was escorted by Marine guard into New York City . No one told him his destination , and it was n't until he saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations building that he knew where the meeting was to be held . But his greatest surprise was yet to come . The vast auditorium which housed the general assembly was filled to its capacity , but there were new faces behind the plaques which designated the member nations . He could n't believe his eyes at first , but as the meeting got under way , he knew that it was true . The highest echelons of the world 's governments were represented , even  --  Jerry gulped at the realization  --  Nikita Khrushchev himself . It was a summit meeting such as he had never dreamed possible , a summit meeting without benefit of long foreign minister 's debate . And the cause of it all , a placid , highly-polished metal robot , was seated blithely at a desk which bore the designation : VENUS . The robot delegate stood up . " Gentlemen , " it said into the microphone , and the great men at the council tables strained to hear the translator 's version through their headphones , " Gentlemen , I thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great neighbor planet , in the interests of peace and progress for all the solar system . I come in the belief that peace is the responsibility of individuals , of nations , and now of worlds , and that each is dependent upon the other . I speak to you now through the electronic instrumentation which has been created for me , and I come to offer your planet not merely a threat , a promise , or an easy solution  --  but a challenge . " The council room stirred . " Your earth satellites have been viewed with interest by the astronomers of our world , and we foresee the day when contact between our planets will be commonplace . As for ourselves , we have hitherto had little desire to explore beyond our realm , being far too occupied with internal matters . But our isolation can not last in the face of your progress , so we believe that we must take part in your affairs . " Here , then , is our challenge . Continue your struggle of ideas , compete with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battles , if you know no other means to attain progress . But do all this without unleashing the terrible forces of power now at your command . Once unleashed , these forces may or may not destroy all that you have gained . But we , the scientists of Venus , promise you this  --  that on the very day your conflict deteriorates into heedless violence , we will not stand by and let the ugly contagion spread . On that day , we of Venus will act swiftly , mercilessly , and relentlessly  --  to destroy your world completely . " Again , the meeting room exploded in a babble of languages . " The vessel which brought me here came as a messenger of peace . But envision it , men of Earth , as a messenger of war . Unstoppable , inexorable , it may return , bearing a different Delegate from Venus  --  a Delegate of Death , who speaks not in words , but in the explosion of atoms . Think of thousands of such Delegates , fired from a vantage point far beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenge that will hang in your night sky from this moment forward . Look at the planet Venus , men of Earth , and see a Goddess of Vengeance , poised to wreak its wrath upon those who betray the peace . " The Delegate sat down . * * * * * Four days later , a mysterious explosion rocked the quiet sands of Los Alamos , and the Venus spacecraft was no more . Two hours after that , the robot delegate , its message delivered , its mission fulfilled , requested to be locked inside a bombproof chamber . When the door was opened , the Delegate was an exploded ruin . The news flashed with lightning speed over the world , and Jerry Bridges ' eyewitness accounts of the incredible event was syndicated throughout the nation . But his sudden celebrity left him vaguely unsatisfied . He tried to explain his feeling to Greta on his first night back in Washington . They were in his apartment , and it was the first time Greta had consented to pay him the visit . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've had the biggest story of the year under your byline . I should think you 'd be tickled pink . " " It 's not that , " Jerry said moodily . " But ever since I heard the Delegate speak , something 's been nagging me . " " But do n't you think he 's done good ? Do n't you think they 'll be impressed by what he said ? " " I 'm not worried about that . I think that damn robot did more for peace than anything that 's ever come along in this cockeyed world . But still ... " Greta snuggled up to him on the sofa . " You worry too much . Do n't you ever think of anything else ? You should learn to relax . It can be fun . " She started to prove it to him , and Jerry responded the way a normal , healthy male usually does . But in the middle of an embrace , he cried out : " Wait a minute ! " " What 's the matter ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell did I put my old notebooks ? " He got up from the sofa and went scurrying to a closet . From a debris of cardboard boxes , he found a worn old leather brief case , and cackled with delight when he found the yellowed notebooks inside . " What are they ? " Greta said . " My old school notebooks . Greta , you 'll have to excuse me . But there 's something I 've got to do , right away ! " " That 's all right with me , " Greta said haughtily . " I know when I 'm not wanted . " She took her hat and coat from the hall closet , gave him one last chance to change his mind , and then left . Five minutes later , Jerry Bridges was calling the airlines . * * * * * It had been eleven years since Jerry had walked across the campus of Clifton University , heading for the ivy-choked main building . It was remarkable how little had changed , but the students seemed incredibly young . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the desk where Professor Martin Coltz could be located . " Professor Coltz ? " She stuck a pencil to her mouth . " Well , I guess he 'd be in the Holland Laboratory about now . " " Holland Laboratory ? What 's that ? " " Oh , I guess that was after your time , was n't it ? " Jerry felt decrepit , but managed to say : " It must be something new since I was here . Where is this place ? " He followed her directions , and located a fresh-painted building three hundred yards from the men 's dorm . He met a student at the door , who told him that Professor Coltz would be found in the physics department . The room was empty when Jerry entered , except for the single stooped figure vigorously erasing a blackboard . He turned when the door opened . If the students looked younger , Professor Coltz was far older than Jerry remembered . He was a tall man , with an unruly confusion of straight gray hair . He blinked when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember me ? Jerry Bridges ? " " Of course ! I thought of you only yesterday , when I saw your name in the papers  --  " They sat at facing student desks , and chatted about old times . But Jerry was impatient to get to the point of his visit , and he blurted out : " Professor Coltz , something 's been bothering me . It bothered me from the moment I heard the Delegate speak . I did n't know what it was until last night , when I dug out my old college notebooks . Thank God I kept them . " Coltz 's eyes were suddenly hooded . " What do you mean , Jerry ? " " There was something about the Robot 's speech that sounded familiar  --  I could have sworn I 'd heard some of the words before . I could n't prove anything until I checked my old notes , and here 's what I found . " He dug into his coat pocket and produced a sheet of paper . He unfolded it and read aloud . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuals , of nations , and someday , even of worlds ... ' Sound familiar , Professor ? " Coltz shifted uncomfortably . " I do n't recall every silly thing I said , Jerry . " " But it 's an interesting coincidence , is n't it , Professor ? These very words were spoken by the Delegate from Venus . " " A coincidence  --  " " Is it ? But I also remember your interest in robotics . I 'll never forget that mechanical homing pigeon you constructed . And you 've probably learned much more these past eleven years . " " What are you driving at , Jerry ? " " Just this , Professor . I had a little daydream , recently , and I want you to hear it . I dreamed about a group of teachers , scientists , and engineers , a group who were suddenly struck by an exciting , incredible idea . A group that worked in the quiet and secrecy of a University on a fantastic scheme to force the idea of peace into the minds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Professor ? " " Go on . " " Well , I dreamt that this group would secretly launch an earth satellite of their own , and arrange for the nose cone to come down safely at a certain time and place . They would install a marvelous electronic robot within the cone , ready to be assembled . They would beam a radio message to earth from the cone , seemingly as if it originated from their ' spaceship . ' Then , when the Robot was assembled , they would speak through it to demand peace for all mankind ... " " Jerry , if you do this  --  " " You do n't have to say it , Professor , I know what you 're thinking . I 'm a reporter , and my business is to tell the world everything I know . But if I did it , there might not be a world for me to write about , would there ? No , thanks , Professor . As far as I 'm concerned , what I told you was nothing more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convertible to a halt , and put his arm around Greta 's shoulder . She looked up at the star-filled night , and sighed romantically . Jerry pointed . " That one . " Greta shivered closer to him . " And to think what that terrible planet can do to us ! " " Oh , I du n no . Venus is also the Goddess of Love . " He swung his other arm around her , and Venus winked approvingly . THE END
