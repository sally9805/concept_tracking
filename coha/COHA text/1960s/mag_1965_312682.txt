By a vote of 263 to 153 , the House last week passed and sent to the Senate one of the key programs of the Great Society : President Johnson 's $1.3 billion education bill to provide federal aid to primary and secondary schools . The measure would grant $100 million for textbooks and library books , $100 million for supplemental education centers such as labmobiles , and $1 billion-plus for public school districts to spend as they see fit . For a district to qualify , 3% or more of its pupils would have to be " needy " ( from families with less than $2,000 income ) - which takes in approximately 90% of the nation 's school districts . <P> The bill would permit church schools to receive some of the new books , and parochial students to " share " in the additional education facilities , but would give no direct payments to private institutions .
