Apart from the bare announcement that two bombs , one of them in the " low-megaton-yield range " had been dropped from airplanes and exploded over the Pacific , the newest U.S. nuclear test series supplied little news last week . Neither diplomatic policy nor the need for military secrecy completely explained the comparative silence . There was , in fact , little to be told . Test bombs are not exploded merely to see if they will work or to admire the bang . The instrumental setup is enormously complicated , with seismographs , barographs , radiation detectors , photocells , and many more subtle instruments spread over hundreds of miles of sea , air and land . Information and analysis come slowly . <P> Merely to collect and compile all the data is a tremendous task . The bulk of the reports from the tests already fired - most of them in the form of magnetic tape or squiggly lines on film or paper-is converging first on Christmas Island , where the Atomic Energy Commission has a team of experts ready to make a quick preliminary search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their handling of later tests . Eventually , the data will be sent to the birthplace of the bombs-Los Alamos and Livermore laboratories-for more detailed study . <P> Hints for Hercules . The military services will get a crack at the data , too . The Air Force is vitally interested in the effects of shock waves and radiation on its aircraft , and the Navy is equally concerned about its ships . The Army is waiting anxiously for the impact that the tests will have on its Nike-Hercules anti-missile program . It will be bad news for the Nike-Hercules if a test bomb exploded at high altitude makes the air opaque to radio waves . This might mean that an elaborate Nike-Hercules base could be blinded by a single nuclear weapon , even by one of its own rockets . <P> While the AEC and the military are claiming their blocks of information , a ship manned by scientists from the University of Washington is gathering fish , plankton and other oceanic fauna and flora to check for radiation effects . Specimens will be sent to Seattle for further study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing by to treat and study any unfortunate humans who tangle with test radiation . <P> Several of the tests , including at least one in the megaton range , will be exploded in space , as high as 100 miles above the earth . The purpose will be partly to observe the little-known behavior of nuclear explosions in a virtual vacuum , partly to test the effect of neutrons , X rays and other radiation on radio communication , missiles and satellites . The Air Force already has several satellites orbiting over the test area . The Russians may send observation satellites of their own , but the tests can probably be timed so that such foreign space snoopers will get no close look .
