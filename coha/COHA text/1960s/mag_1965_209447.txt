At 47 , Louisiana 's Democratic Senator Russell Long has been in the U.S. Senate for 17 years , and seems assured of remaining there as long as he wants the job . As Democratic whip , he is Mike Mansfield 's heir apparent to the Senate 's majority leadership . In addition , with the resignation of Virginia Democrat Harry Byrd ( TIME , Nov. 19 ) , Long , the ranking Democrat on Byrd 's powerful Senate Finance Committee , will automatically become committee chairman when Congress reconvenes in January . Seldom in Senate history has one man held two such pivotal posts , and there were hints last week that fellow Senators will try to relieve him of one , probably the whip 's job . <P> So far , the only Senator to suggest publicly that Long step down as whip has been Arizona 's Carl Hayden . Long was not about to take the hint . In Baton Rouge last week , he threw down the gauntlet . " If they do n't want me to do it , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That could be difficult . Long has staunch supporters in the Senate , an admirer in Lyndon Johnson , and the family stomach for infighting-as he showed last January when he defeated Rhode Island 's John Pastore and Oklahoma 's Mike Monroney for the whip 's job . This time around , Pastore , at least , has declared himself out of the running . Said he : " I see no reason why Long should not continue as whip along with his other committee assignments . So far as the whip 's office is concerned , I was lukewarm to it last year , and today I am absolutely frigid . "
