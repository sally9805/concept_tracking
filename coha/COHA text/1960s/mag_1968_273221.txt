John Kenneth Galbraith , peripatetic ambassador , author , political adviser and now professor at Harvard , took the occasion of his 60th birthday for a bit of mental meandering . On age : " I sha n't be sorry when men begin to refer to me as old . But I 'll be awfully sorry when women do . " On politics : " Do n't go near any political headquarters . Except for a stirring at election time , they 're a kind of grim repository of people who like politics and ca n't get jobs elsewhere .

The trigger-tempered playboy son of the late Dominican dictator had held her a virtual prisoner of love at his European estates for almost five years-or so the stories went . Then the romantic legend began to falter , as Danile missed her cue and told reporters : " It 's true that my husband wanted me to live on his estates in France and Spain , but it was not against my will .
