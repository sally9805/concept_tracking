 | Longest Main Street in the World DRIVING NORTH on the Alaska Highway last summer , my wife and I stopped at a roadhouse to get gas . The proprietor chatted about the condition of the road , asked how the Peace River wheat crop looked to us , then said , " Mind dropping a case of engine oil at the next Texaco station ? I hear he 's running short . " " Be glad to , " I said . " Where 's the Texaco place ? " " Just up the road , on your right . About 67o miles . " All along the 1523-mile length of the Alaska Highway , from Mile 0 at Dawson Creek in British Columbia to the end of the line at Fairbanks , Alaska , lodgekeepers and highway-maintenance crews are linked by this same small-town sense of helpfulness . Truckers , bus drivers , touring schoolteachers , rotating Army families ? all are apt to be pressed into service as couriers on this longest and most rugged Main Street in the world . A name and milepost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message ? or a side of moose meat ? to its destination " just up the road . " For all Highway dwellers are neighbors , drawn together by the loneliness of the empty land . They will travel 500 miles to one another 's parties , making a once-a-year visit sustain a community spirit that can not be broken by the winding miles or the solitude of blizzard-driven winters or the unimaginable immensity of wilderness . Though only 400 miles of the  | Highway are paved ? the Alaskan section and the 84-mile stretch out of Dawson Creek ? its full length has been traversed by hikers , motorcyclists , a Ferris wheel , a 150-trailer caravan , and all manner of cars from Model T 's to Cadillacs . Now more than 20 years old , the Highway still is North America 's adventure road . It carries you up around the continent 's mightiest mountains , across great river systems ? the Yukon , Peace and Liard ? and past an astonishing array of wildlife . A black bear throws up his arms like an embarrassed jaywalker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1500-pound moose dawdles along in front of you , in no rush to make room for human trespassers on what he has come to regard as a private path through his wilderness . Through your car window you can see valiant silver salmon choke a mile-wide river as they fight their way upstream to spawn and die . Now there is change in the wind . A study recently completed for the Canadian government suggests that a paved Highway would result in great economic gain for the North country . Though not imminent ? the costs would be staggering ? a paving program is probably inevitable . When it comes , the adventure road will be buried under asphalt , and civilization will have caught up with another " last frontier . " Could n't Be Done . Before the road was built , dreamers had been advocating a land route to Alaska for 50 years ? and for 50 years " realists " had held that it could n't be done . Then came Pearl Harbor . Confronted with the possibility of a naval blockade of our North Pa cific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road had to be put through . A regiment of Army Engineers suddenly appeared at the tiny settlement of Dawson Creek in British Columbia , and another began toppling trees south of Big Delta , Alaska . A trapper , fresh in from a winter in the bush , took one look at all the soldiery and said , " What the hell 's going on here ? You 'd think there was a war on ! " The soldiers were equally nonplused by their new environment . In the winter cold , bulldozer blades snapped . In summer , the ground turned to jelly , and muskeg swamps swallowed culverts , tractors and even mile-long sections of newly laid road . Mosquitoes were of such prodigious size that in one camp , so the story goes , the men shot them down with pistols . Pushing north and south , the Engineers and Canadian construction workers crossed shifting moraine gravels , areas of permafrost , and rivers whose course could change by 200 yards during the lunch break . The builders did not , as once reported , follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turnings of the route were dictated by the need to get around mountains , bottomless bogs and mile-high hills of ice . On October 23 , 1942 , the two work parties met at Mile 588 , a place promptly christened Contact Creek .  | service stations were appearing almost every 50 miles along the road , now officially known as the Alaska Highway . Temporary bridges were replaced , the worst curves were straightened , and growing numbers of adventurous tourists were pounding along the gravel every day of the week , winter and summer . But many a man has learned ? the hard way ? that the Highway is still no parkway , and that prudence remains an essential traveling companion on the road . Every roadhouse has its favorite tale about the cheechakos ( greenhorns ) . For Too miles up and down the Prophet River they still slap their thighs when they tell about the tourist who came plunging downhill one black night , brakes screeching as he suddenly bounced aboard a ferry temporarily replacing a washed-out bridge . He was brought to a desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the craft . The crew waited until he had a grip on his shattered nerves ? then told him that six nights out of seven they tied up on the other side of the river . When the roadhouse people say , " So long , see you again , " they mean it . Traveling the Highway becomes contagious . Alaskans , " liberated " by their land link to the south , now make the trip " Outside " regularly . And even cheechakos , once inspired by the road 's rugged magnificence , are hard put to keep off it . We first drove the Highway in 1961 , reaching the last milepost @# At a cost of nearly $100,000 a mile , some 16,000 Canadians and Americans had accomplished one of history 's great engineering feats by punching the Alcan Military Highway through the wilderness in only eight months and 11 days . Reward for an Urge . Two years after the war 's end , lodges and  | weary and dust-laden and vowing never again . Two years later we were back , and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as surely as I write these words we will all be heading north once more ? in a year , two years , sometime . The adventure road is made for those of us who were born too late to sail uncharted oceans or blaze a trail through the wilderness . It richly rewards the urge to seek out the wonders beyond the next horizon . Instant Aging . It surprises you with a different face at every turning . Dawson Creek , a bustling community that was all but leveled when a dynamite warehouse blew up during construction days , now looks deceptively like some midwestern U.S. county seat , the locals saltily tolerant of tourists who clamber out at the main intersection to photograph the historic " Milepost 0 " marker . They have grown solid and staid as their town has become the center of a burgeoning oil industry . In the rich Peace River Valley , where there is land for the homesteading on every side , even a parttime farmer can grow 50 bushels of wheat to the acre , and the record is a staggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Fort St. John sits on the far side of the river , caught between yesterday and tomorrow , many of its people still living in expanded versions of the huts and sheds thrown up when the Highway was building . On the other hand , the town boasts a nine-hole golf course and at least three of those absolutely essential Highway handmaidens , coin laundries . Abruptly the pavement ends . Now the road becomes a lonely white thread winding through the green mat of the forest . A plume of brown dust follows your car , and a cloud of it engulfs you with every passing vehicle . Experienced hands drive with their headlights on in broadest daylight , and with a piece of bright-colored cloth tied to a fully extended radio antenna , the better to make their presence known in the billowing dust storms thrown u whenever two cars meet . I remember sneaking a sidewise. look at my wife during our firs trip , and noting with shock that th ? - rich red color of her hair had fade and that her once-clear skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , thought , and reached over t ? squeeze her hand . Twenty mile farther on , when I took off my su glasses to wipe off an eighth-inc layer of powdered road , I realize what had happened : seeping silent through the locked car doors an tightly closed windows , the dust ha not only aged us both but all h buried us . By the time we unpacke our car trunk at Fort Nelson , m electric razor ? which had been protected by a zippered case wrappe in clothing inside a suitcase covere with a tarpaulin ? was delicately coated with dust . " Two in One Week ! " Because of the summer dust , many drivers pre . fer the winter road . Up to ten feet 125 snow has been packed hard and smooth , and the mosquitoes and the dust are gone . But there is no margin for error on the winter road , and it no place for innocents abroad . A highway engineer whose car skidded on a curve and flipped over calculated that he would be frozen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't afford to pin his hopes on another motorist happening along , he removed his ire chains , spun them up and round the electric wires overhead and short-circuited the line . At the lay station , the break was quickly pinpointed and a repair crew arrived the spot in 45 minutes . Beyond Fort Nelson the road veers to the west , climbing toward the snows that top the jagged Rockies . There is hardly a guardrail on the Highway . You may be driving long a high , straight section , the forests stretching interminably north and south , when suddenly , exactly 400 feet beyond a warning sign , the Highway wrenches away in a wild left turn . Ahead there is nothing : no road , no forest , only the blue sky and a thousand-foot drop to treetops below . If you have n't heeded the warning to slow down for the curve , you will not make it to Alaska . Now the road crosses into the Yukon and swings toward Whitehorse . Through Whitehorse came the hordes who made the gold rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seacoast and down the rivers and lakes to the Yukon , hellbent for the Klondike , they poured . Only a meager few struck it rich , although Too million dollars in gold was panned from the fabled creeks by 1904 . But Whitehorse prospered , and prospers now as the nerve center of the Highway . Like specters from some other world , the great white stern-wheel steamers that once regularly plied the Yukon River sit silent and forever still on the bank . Civilization has in no way inhibited the authentic characters of the  | Yukon . One of the most entrancing is Joe Prokop , a sixtyish trapper who lives alone in the bush and looks like Santa Claus . Joe has been painting startlingly vivid Yukon scenes for as long as anyone can remember and , if you want to buy one , just leave word in any store or hotel . In a day or so , courtesy of the " moccasin telegraph , " Joe will bring you one picture ? take it or leave it . Why wo n't he say where he lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stompin ' all over the place . There was two in one week ! " Light in the Window . Beyond Whitehorse , you will find no more than a handful of people in any one place ? no towns , no communities , only a lodge or roadhouse every 30 or 40 miles . But in these places reside the soul and spirit of the Highway . Here are the valiant couples who pump gas , broil hamburgers and leave a light burning all night beside a cheery little note : " Take any room with the door open . Settle in the morning . " At Haines Junction you can , if you wish , leave the Highway and drive 159 miles south to Haines , and there catch an auto ferry homeward . For the past four years , Alaska 's auto ferries , as large and luxurious as ocean liners , have offered summer service six days a week from Prince Rupert on the British Columbia coast to the towns and villages of southeastern Alaska , by way of the Inside Pa sage . This May , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Rupert terminal so that visitors to Alaska ca now make the entire trip by ferry liner one way and by car the other . We did n't turn south at Haines Junction . We stayed on the Highway , driving up over the backbone of the St. Elias Mountains , past Snag at Mile 1188 ( where a North American record cold of 81 degrees below zero was once registered ) . Crossing into Alaska , we left the Highway at Tok and headed southwest toward Anchorage . Our 55-mile-an-hour speed on the unaccustomed black seemed supersonic . Ahead was great American city with all amenities ? civilization ! Then , barely ten miles from the soaring hotels and room service and chic resturants , we stopped at a diner coffee . On the next stool sat a thoroughly bemused bread deliveryman his arm in a sling and his forehead freshly bandaged . " I never had a chance , " he saying to the waitress . " The thing bounced right out on the road . The truck looks like an accordion . " " What thing ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Biggest damn bull moose ever saw ! " @#
