txt A War Chest for the ' reacher DALLAS  --  Dr. William G. Carr ? WI , gray-haired , relaxedly distinguished  --  looked like a schoolman of the old generation , and for the 15 years that he was executive secretary of the National Education Association his moderate to conservative views were paramount in the world 's largest professional organization . Last July , just before his retirement at age 66 , Dr. Carr delivered his final report to the N.E.A. 's annual convention in Minneapolis and , in part , he said this : " It is my considered personal opinion and advice that the use of strikes by the teaching profession for the economic advantage of the teacher , especially when such action is contrary to law and order , will impair and ultimately destroy the confidence of the public in the teacher . And when that is gone , the American public schools will have lost something precious and irreplaceable . " Massive Support That was Dr. Carr 's position but it left with him . At Minneapolis the association 's new leaders decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command . " And , last week , after a turbulent year of stoppages , the hierarchy laid plans to dig in , not least of all into the purses and wallets of the N.E.A. 's million members . At the organization 's convention here , Braulio Alonso , the outgoing N.E.A. president , called for a multimillion-dollar " defense fund " to back striking teachers and to " prevent reprisals " against them . Mr. Alonso , a Tampa high school principal until he resigned during the N.E.A.-aided Florida teachers strike in September , spoke for the association 's executive committee and board of directors , including the incoming president , Mrs. Elizabeth D. Koontz . Mrs. Koontz is the first Negro to serve as head of the 109-year-old organization . To build up the fund , Mr. Alonso asked for a yearly dues increase from $15 to $25 starting in September , 1969 , and the association 's Representative Assembly is expected to approve the measure next summer . N.E.A. leaders had concluded by the Minneapolis meeting that a growing number of teachers were prepared to walk out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved education , better working conditions or higher salaries . " We have learned that today 's teacher is no longer afraid of trouble , " Dr. Sam M. Lambert , Dr. Carr 's successor at the . N.E.A. , observed recently . " He is willing to risk his future , his prestige and his pocketbook if that 's what it takes to open America 's eyes to education's. ills . " Alternative Moreover , if the association had n't been ready to assist the more militant instructors , the smaller , often more aggressive , urban-oriented American Federation of Teachers , A.F.L.-C.I.O. , was an alternative for their allegiance . While N.E.A. affiliates are overwhelmingly predominant in suburban and rural communities , federation locals have proved their attraction in winning collective bargaining elections in New York , Detroit , Philadelphia , Washington , Baltimore , Pittsburgh and Boston . In the last 12 months however , the N.E.A. hierarchy has digested other , more practical lessons  --  that strikes , particularly state wide , cost the association large sums of money and that the power to influence both strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and governments is related to the magnitude of the association coffers in Washington . The N.E.A. , which supported stoppages last year in such different places as affluent Montgomery County , Md. , and poor Pikes County , Ky. , spent about $2-million in the three-week Florida walkout , which Dr. Lambert has termed " one of the biggest ' show-and-tell ' demonstrations in the history of education . " But , in providing this help , the association seriously drained its allocation for aiding " teacher rights " throughout the year . And the moral of the situation was noted by Mr. Alonso last week in his appeal for a special fund . " If the fund is large enough to show we can withstand an extended period of inactivity by striking teachers , impasses will be resolved quickly , " he said . " Power bends with the application of power . " The outlook , then , is for escalated teacher militancy . Dr. Lambert has predicted a tripling in the coming school year of the 100 strikes of the year just ended and there is little reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this could be more statewide , stoppages , unknown before the Florida experience . N.E.A. officials have examined the Florida walkout with care . They are impressed by what they believe can be done on a state level and they are mapping what Dr. Lambert called " more effective strategies for the future . " On Changing Columbia The Ford Foundation announced last week that it will give $100,500 to three groups studying the reorganization of Columbia University following the turbulent student demonstrations last spring . The Executive Committee of the Columbia Faculty will receive $50,000 for ? series of studies on the power and structure of Columbia and other universities . The committee will then submit recommendations on restructuring the university . Teachers College of Columbia University will receive $40,500 for a summer colloquium on the problems of higher eduCetion . A number ' of institutions throughout the country will be studied and a report will be issued at the end of the session . Students for a Restructured University will receive $10,000 . This group , which supported the student strike at Columbia and contends that the university should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct research during the summer and then submit a report on how it believes the university should be governed . - NI .
