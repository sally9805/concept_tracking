txt Washington Adlai E. Stevenson , who passed on in London Wednesday , was an extraordinarily deft and adroit representative of the United States on the global stage at the United Nations . Free of the anguish of two grueling presidential campaigns in 1952 and again in 1956 , Mr. Stevenson settled . down to a spirited defense of United States foreign policy and action . No American politician in this century was ever to shape a phrase with more telling intellectual effect . But in facing Dwight D. Eisenhower in two campaigns , he knew deep inside that it probably was a losing battle . Under President Kennedy he took up the struggle for peace with gusto  --  and an elegant phrase . He spoke out for international justice and for wisdom in handling the global Communist threat . At the time of his passing Wednesday in London , he had been talking with British officials about Southeast Asia and had seen Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart that morning . Looking back on his two campaigns Mr. Stevenson once said this : " There is evidence that those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awakening , of political purpose in the minds of many thinking Americans ; that they aroused a new or broader sense of personal responsibility in political affairs , a large respect for the political proc- Drawn by Felix Palm Ambassador Stevenson ' The one transcendent issue ... is peace . ' ess , a sense of ideals attainable through political activity . " I like to think they reduced the snobbery about politics ; that there is more realization that free society demands the wisest kind of political leadership ; that without politics there can be no democraticfreedom , not even the freedom to be ' above politics . ' " And I have never felt any sense of defeat for the ideas of talking sense , of tackling the hard issues , of telling the truth , in a political campaign . " It is extremely important that those who have taken part in this invigoration of the political process take up again now the cudgels they wielded so gloriously before .

Aiken ( R ) of Vermont said Mr. Stevenson " did his work conscientiously and he did it well . " He added it was unfortunate that " now , perhaps when he is needed more than ever , he has been called away . " In campaigning in the 1960 campaign , Mr. Stevenson indicated his future role in the United Nations . In Madison , Wisconsin . in October he said : " The one transcendent issue . . . is peace . The farmer wants better prices ; but he wants peace more . The housewife wants lower prices , of course ; but she wants peace more . The businessman wants stability and the laborer wants security , of course ; but they want peace more . " Words such as this were also used at the United Nations and outside of a domestic political context . It was the same  --  he sought paths toward peace above partisan feelings .
