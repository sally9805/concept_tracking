MELBOURNE ( 432 pp. ) - Lord David Cecil-Charter Books ( $2.75 ) . <P> President Kennedy 's favorite book concerns a British statesman who made a policy of keeping his country at a standstill for close to a decade and boasting of it . Issued now in paperback , this famed biography of Lord Melbourne makes plain that he was one of the most indecisive , lackadaisical and delightful persons ever to run a country . <P> In the halcyon days of the middle 19th century , when there were no wars and the most burning issues were the price of corn and the rise of trade unions , Melbourne was able to make a career of wit and irony . He shocked his fellow politicians by his love of paradox , his itch to ridicule everything , including himself . " The stomach is the seat of health , strength , thought and life , " he said , alluding to his fondness for food and drink .

He belonged to the great Whig dynasty , whose members " took on the task of directing England 's destinies with the same self-confident vigour that they drank and diced . " Lamb was never certain who his father was because , as he put it , his mother " was not chaste .

He much preferred books and parties . But at 51 , after several torpid years in Parliament , he was brought into a Whig Cabinet as Home Secretary . He snapped out of his indolence by harshly putting down hunger riots in the south of England . " I like what is tranquil and stable , ' ' he announced , and achieved tranquillity by hanging several of the leaders . He scoffed at earnest middle-class reformers , once received a group of them lounging on his sofa . While they talked , he pulled a feather out of a pillow , began to blow it about the room . " Try to do no good , " Melbourne advised , " and then you wo n't get into any scrapes . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
