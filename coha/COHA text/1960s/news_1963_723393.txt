txt The dispute over the new City Charter 's provision for electing councilmen at large will be decided this week . If the controversial parts of the Charter are upheld , the way will be cleared for the nomination of candidates for councilmen at large in the primary on Sept. 5 and the placing of the nominees on the ballot for the general election Nov. 5 . Arguments will be heard by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in Manhattan tomorrow at 2 P.M. The city 's appeal from a ruling Aug , 8 by Supreme Court Justice Irwin D. Davidson will be considered and the court is expected to hand down a ruling within 24 hours . The Court of Appeals , the highest in the state , will convene in Albany at noon Thursday to hear arguments on the expected appeal from the decision by the Appellate Division . A ruling by the Court of Appeals is expected to come a day or two later . In his decision of Aug. 8 , Justice Davidson held unconstitutional the parts of Section 22 of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of councilmen at large . Two councilmen would be chosen from each of the city 's five boroughs , with the voters in each borough balloting for only orie ' candidate and political parties forbidden to nominate more than one candidate in each borough . The purpose of the limited voting was to insure broader minority representation in the City Council , whose membership Would be increased from 25 ' to 35 . Justice Davidson has barred the holding of primary and general elections for ' the new positions on the ground that the limited voting would violate Article II , Section 1 of the State Constitution by depriving voters of their right to cast a ballot for all elective offices to be filled in the . boroughs in which they vote : Based on Blaikie Suit Justice Davidson 's decision was made-in a suit brought by Robert B. Blailtie , an insurgent Democrat , who is also a candi date for his party 's nomination as a councilman at large from Manhattan . Mr. Blaikie ' and Corporation Counsel Leo A. Larkin , the city 's representative , ' have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from any adverse decision by the Appellate Divison ? The prospect of an early settlement of the controversy by a Court of Appeals ruling gave impetus to campaigning by candidates for nominations to the new councilmanic posts . But Councilman Joseph C. DiCarlo , Bronx Democrat , presumably unaware of the highest court 's decision to hear any appeal from the Appellate Division as early as next Thursday , said that he would ask the Council tomorrow to adopt a resolution calling for postponement of , the primary to Sept. 12 . He will ask Governor Rockefeller.to call a special session of the ' , Legislature to authorize the : postponement . The city , in its arguments before the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals , is expected to contend that Article II , Section 1 of the State Constitution has no bearing on the case ; that the Court of Appeals has already decided , in effect , that limited voting in New York City , is not barred ; and that in any event the creation of the 10 positions of councilmen at large is constitutional even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not . ? The city is expected to argue that if the limited voting is rejected , there must be an election for the new positions , with each voter in a borough entitled to support both of the two candidates his party may nominate . The city 's arguments are expected to rely almost entirely on the decision of the Court of Appeals on June 2 , 1937 , in the case of Johnson v. City of New York . That decision upheld the constitutionality , of voting for Councilmen by proportional representation . This type of voting began in the 1937 election but was discontinued several years later after its rejection in a referendum . The high court 's decision pointed out that the present language in Article . II , Section 1 of the State . Constitution was in substance that used in 1826 when the Constitution was amended to remove all disqualifications of voters , such as on status as payers of taxes on real or personal property . Chief Judge Frederick Crane , in an opinion with which five other judges agreed , indicated his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of the language used in 1826.
