With all the casual calm of a Grand Canyon-on-your-left announcement , Pilot Donald Cook 's voice came over the public-address system : " There 's a man here who wants to go somewhere , and he 's just chartered himself an airplane . " The 39 passengers on TWA Flight 85 , over Fresno and bound for San Francisco , suddenly realized that they had joined the growing ranks of the skyjacked . It was not simply the 55th case of skyjacking in 1969 ; it turned out to be the longest and oddest pirated flight in aviation history . <P> One man , armed with a folding-stock M-l carbine , changed Flight 85 from a routine run into a fantastic flying hegira that led all the way across the U.S. and then over the Atlantic to a bizarre conclusion in Rome . All through its strange progress , the changing track of Flight 85 compelled the attention of the earthbound : the FBI , air-traffic controllers , and-quite understandably - President Forwood Wiser of TWA , who sat out the 17-hour ordeal with other top company executives at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agency official : " That flight was handled as if it were Air Force One . " The general public of two continents hung on Flight 85 's every move , fascinated by the airborne drama . Once again it was evident that the awesome machines of the jet age can become even more fragile hostages than the hapless crews themselves . <P> The skyjacker himself was an especially unlikely sort . A young ( 20 last week ) , pleasant-looking Marine veteran of Viet Nam , Lance Corporal Rafael Minichiello was absent without leave from Camp Pendleton , Calif . The Italian-born lad thought the Corps had cheated him of $200 in pay . To get even , he had broken into a PX and was facing a special court-martial when he quit Pendleton . <P> Warning Shot . After Flight 85 left Los Angeles , Stewardess Tanya Novacoff saw Minichiello fiddling with something under his seat . " Oh , I 'm putting together a fishing rod , " he explained . The fishing rod was the carbine , and a few minutes later Stewardess Charlene Delmonico was marching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon in her back . " I mean business , " said Minichiello . <P> Once inside the cockpit , Minichiello held the carbine at the flight engineer 's head and ordered Pilot Cook to head for New York . Cook laconically radioed the FAA control center in Oakland : " Rerouting to change to New York on account of hijacking . " FBI agents hastened to Kennedy Airport , but in the meantime Cook persuaded the skyjacker to let him put down at Denver to refuel and allow the passengers and three of the four stewardesses to disembark . Fearful of making a dangerous situation worse , ground personnel did not intervene . After the Denver stop , the red and white jet took off again . Minichiello ordered Cook to stop at the end of a refueling apron far from the Kennedy Airport terminal buildings . FBI agents approached the plane , but Cook warned them away ; at TWA 's request , they did not open fire .
