Within two weeks after set sail the London Sunday Times 's round-the-world yacht race last October , Donald Crowhurst 's 41 - foot trimaran , the Teign-mouth Electron , had started falling apart . The lacing on the boom snapped , the port forward hatch sprang a leak , and then his generator went out , leaving him without electricity for three days . While his boat disintegrated with the pounding of heavy seas , the sailor 's sanity , strained as it was by the loneliness of the solo odyssey and haunted by the specter of fail ure , also began to fall apart . <P> Crowhurst 's damaged boat was found in the mid-Atlantic 81 months after he set out from the resort town of Teign-mouth on the southern coast of Eng land . His position , 700 miles southwest of the Azores , indicated that he was front runner for the fastest time . Though Crowhurst , 36 , was missing , his logbooks , which gradually lapsed into incoherence , provide a revealing case study of the effects of extended solitude . <P> " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after eleven days at sea . After two weeks , Crowhurst surmised that he was running dead last in the race , and began debating in his small , neat handwriting whether he should chuck the whole thing and put in for home . But he noted that he needed the $12,000 prize money to solve his financial problems . Depressed and once physically ill , he devoted long passages to his inability to admit failure , even when he realized it was certain . " Superficial assessments of success or failure are worthless , " he rationalized . <P> Double Logs . In the last stages of his despondency , when he began to lapse into nonsense , Crowhurst observed that life is a chess game played against " cosmic beings . " But the proper strategy for success eluded him , as his boat suffered new damage almost daily . " It is finished . It is finished . IT IS THE MERCY , " he wrote enigmatically on July 1 , the date of his final entry . " I will play this game when I choose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sentence was never completed . <P> There are no clues to what became of Crowhurst . It may have been suicide , an imprudent swim in shark-filled waters , or simply a misstep on a slippery deck . A number of friends in Teign-mouth , the town that helped sponsor his trip , hold out hope that he is still alive . <P> The most intriguing aspect of the voyage was discovered last week by Sir Francis Chichester , the celebrated circumnavigator , who was a judge in the race . Examining Crowhurst 's logs , he found that the yachtsman had sailed 14,500 miles but never left the Atlantic . He had invented his positions in countless short-wave radio broadcasts to indicate that he was traveling around the world . Moreover , Crowhurst began a new logbook on Dec. 12 , and about that time he began sending false radio messages . It appears that he intended to fill the old log with fake entries and throw the new one away when he landed . And while his jottings became more distressed , the tape recordings he did for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous shape , " he taped a week before his last navigational log entry . " There is nothing like going to sea for getting rid of all the poisons in your body . "
