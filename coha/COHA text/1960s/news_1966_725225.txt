BR23 Letters To The Editor Letters and Curls TO THE EDITOR : In her biography of Mrs. Gardner , " Mrs. Jack , " Mrs. ise Hall Tharp tells us on page 130 and on page 335 , note 9 , that Mrs. Gardner 's letters to Bernard Berenson must have been destroyed by him because Sylvia Sprigge , during her work on the Berenson biography , had been unable to see them . Miss Sprigge prepared her biography during Bernard Berenson 's lifetime and her book was already published when I discovered the Gardner letters , after his death , during the process of clearing out every cupboard and stackroom at I Tatti . The most surprising thing about Mrs. Tharp 's statement is that she has been herself in correspondence with me about these very letters early in 1964 . In the Berenson archive at I Tatti there are 307 letters by Mrs. Gardner to Bernard and Mary Berenson . Yet in another statement Mrs. Tharp follows Miss Sprigge 's lead blindly . On page 129 we are told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduced opposite to page 210 are " ritualistic . " Clearly neither Miss Sprigge nor Mrs. Tharp have taken the trouble to find out what ritualistic curls look like and how they have to be worn . NICKY MARIANO . Florence , Italy . Mrs. Tharp replies : While preparing my latest book , " Mrs. Jack : A Biography of Isabella Stewart Gardner , " I read and enjoyed Sylvia Sprigge 's excellent " Berenson : A Biography " ( Houghton Mifflin , 1960 ) . Mrs. Sprigge said she had found no letters from Isabella Stewart Gardner at I ' Patti , the Berenson villa just outside of Florence , Italy . Mrs. Sprigge and I had an interesting correspondence . On April 21 , 1963 , I wrote to Professor Murdock of Harvard , then at I Tatti . I asked about letters by Ralph Curtis , and on the chance that there might be Gardner letters , I asked about them , as well . On May 9 , 1963 , Miss Cantarella , Professor Murdock 's secretary , replied suggesting that I come to I Tatti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who owns the Berenson papers , would not make Gardner letters available . On May 16 , 1963 , I wrote to Miss Mariano to say that I would appreciate knowing how many Gardner letters there were , and if possible , I would like some general idea of their dates . This query was not answered . On July 5 , 1963 , I wrote to Miss Mariano saying , " Could you answer just one question for me now ? How many letters from Isabella Gardner to Berenson and to Mary Berenson are there at Villa I Tatti ? " Again , I had no answer to this question . It was not until after " Mrs. Jack " had appeared in print that I received information indirectly through a letter written to my publisher by Professor Gilmore. to the effect that there are 307 letters from Mrs. Gardner at I Tatti . I was sorry not to be allowed to see Mrs. Gardner 's letters but they were quoted or referred to in Berenson 's replies , so that I was able to fill out my biography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both confused and diaI appointed in David Donald 's review of " Lee " by Clifford Dowdey ( Nov. 28 ) . Displaying to a shocking degree the lack of " fairness and generosity of spirit " of which he accuses Dowdey , Donald damns this latest biography of Lee with faint praise for Dowdey 's other works on the Confederacy . He also damns Dowdey for not writing in the style and with the viewpoint that Donald himself prefers , Posing as an expert in psychological interpretation , Mr. Donald criticizes Dowdey 's thesis that Lee could be at the same time both an outwardly serene and commanding figure and a human being beset with aggressive drives and frustrations . Such is the antithesis with innumerable great figures ? as any historian knows . WILLIAM W. HASSLER . Indiana , Pa . Hoffa To THE EDITOR : I SHOULD have expected the type of review A. H. Raskin gave to " Tentacles of Power , " but I had hoped that by this time Mr. Raskin would be past the stage of apologies and half-apologies for James R. Hoffa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misuse of power by Molts , and then he is almost admiring in commenting on the way Hoffa has combined brute force and other powers to beat down union members , employers and other unions . Mr. Raskin wrote critically of the way Hoffa 's " cynical code was accepted uncomplainingly , even enthusiastically , by the members of his union and the great bulk of the employers in his industry , to say nothing of many leaders of the federation , which had kicked him out as a disgrace to labor . " I did not accept Hoffa in the cynical manner that many in labor . industry and the press accepted him . Initially , I hoped he would reform and become a decent force in society . After several years of futile hope . I gave up on that belief . The major battle was just plain hard factual reporting of the documented record on Hoffa 's activities and actions that were thoroughly inconsistent with what he claimed he was doing . This was quite a battle , to get the facts across in a period when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoffa version on practically anything ' because many reporters had the cynical attitude that he had the power and would retain the power . This justified total , or near total prostitution . to be on the right side of a powerful news source . There are aspects of the book by the Jamses " Hoffa and the Teamsters " ) that I find commendable . However , it contains too many apologies for Hoffa and only two sentences dealing with massive tampering with a Federal jury in Tennessee , a crime for which he stands convicted . Their handling of the pension-fund frauds was worse . If Mr. Raskin finds that commendable , then argument is hopeless . I had expected fairness and I was greatly disappointed . CLARK R. MOLLEN HOFF . Washington . to make up his own mind if he gets all the relevant facts . The great virtue of the Jameses ' book was that its documented recital of how Hoffa operates provided a more devastating and incriminating total record than all the court trials and all the journalistic expos ? s . Editorials belong on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. ELLICYTT , in his essay " Writers on Campus " asserts that " The Thief 's Journal " by Jean Genet is " one of the profoundly moral books of the age .. . . " I challenge him to prove that either Genet 's autobiography or his plays are " profoundly moral " by any standards except the most inverted , anarchic , nihilistic and artsakist . Hue ir DICKINSON . Chicago . Mr. Elliott replies : " The Thief 's Journal " is a moral book because , in describing his actions and motives , themselves often dreadful , Genet uses a language which is both literarily and morally accurate . To make clear to a sympathetic reader the dark intricacies of perversion and malice is surely a high accomplishment in literary , confession , and for a writer to do this without in any way asking us to shudder at his vileness , applaud his truth-telling , or pity him is , in my view , virtuous . There comes a point where literary clarity becomes moral honesty ; in this book , at least , Genet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two schools of reporting . One is the Avenging Angel type , of which Clark Mollenhoff is a dedicated and distinguished exponent .
