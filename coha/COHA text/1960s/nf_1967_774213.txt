txt  | Goldwater had purged the Republican Party of the Liberals , " wrote Kent Courtney , " such as Rockefeller , Romney and Scranton , then there would have been no need to establish a new conservative political party . " ii Kent Courtney is currently trying to set up independent Conservative Parties in as many states as possible . The immediate goal is thirty states by 1968 . Over half have been set up already in such states as Florida , Georgia , Missouri , Illinois , Colorado , Washington , New Jersey , Pennsylvania and Kansas . Some of these parties were set up independently of Courtney 's efforts ; others , such as the Conservative Party of New York , will have nothing to do with him . Nevertheless , Courtney is encouraging them all . Publicly , he claims no interest in controlling the majority of these new organizations . " My only purpose is to get the conservative movement going . If Buckley comes along and says I am the leader ' and the people follow him , God bless them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conservative wing . " Physically , Kent Courtney is one of the largest men on the right . He weighs some 230 pounds , has two chins and an outsized waistline . Recently he told an audience of which I was a part that he had lost 35 pounds so he could no longer claim to be " the biggest patriot around . " Courtney has reddish hair , a self-confident air and a powerful platform delivery . One of his speaking techniques is to encourage audience participation . Whenever the name of , say , Mrs. Roosevelt is mentioned , the audience boos , when Ike is mentioned it hisses , and with Goldwater it applauds . Courtney also uses the " wake-up technique " to good effect , shouting at the top of his lungs at a key point in his speech . For instance , at a speech he gave in 1965 to some sixty people in a Baltimore high school auditorium , he said , his voice soft and persuasive : " . . . Without hurting the civilians in South Viet Nam , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies ' who are supplying our enemies , here Courtney shouted in shrill tones THESE SHIPS ARE SUPPLYING OUR ENEMIES ; THIS I CALL TREASON ! . . . ' " The entire audience jumped about two inches , a young YAF placard-carrier off to one side almost fell out of his seat , and a Birch Society matron , arranging literature in the lobby , came dashing around the corner to see if anything was  | wrong . By this time Courtney had resumed speaking in his normal well-modulated voice . Among men , Courtney 's language often turns pungent . For instance , to me and three or four other men , he expressed his displeasure with a well-known newspaper columnist by saying , " The next time I see him " ? here Courtney grabbed imaginary lapels and jerked a knee into the air ? " I 'm going to . . . kick him in the cajones ! " He also has the gift for the colorful phrase and story , which he often uses in his speeches . The 1960 Republican VicePresidential candidate he refers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subject Americans to " mass Pavlovian brainwashing every day , " particularly , as he told the high school auditorium audience , the Baltimore " Fun . " His favorite story concerns the Republican elephant and the Democratic donkey , which , he tells us , were two different animals before 1952 . " But then they began sleeping together and the product , " he said , his arms spread in mock horror , " was wond'rous to behold : the blood line of the ass was stronger so they called it the Donkeyphant . ' Others called it the Elephonkey . ' You could n't tell which end which noise was coming out from . . . . " The same audience laughed and clapped . Kent Courtney describes his wife as " so far right that the only thing beyond is outer space . " Phoebe Courtney is an ebullient , fasttalking woman with braided hair . Her language is almost as colorful as her husband 's . She is supposed to order her steaks , for instance , " communist blood red . " Kent Courtney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional patriot , " has been stumping the country since 1965 trying to arouse interest in a third-party movement . I attended a one-day " Congress of Conservatives , " held the day after his Baltimore high school auditorium speech . There were forty-eight others in attendance from Delaware , Maryland , New Jersey , Pennsylvania and New York . The purpose of the congress was to discuss the reasons for and the problems of setting up a third party . " We 're the only party who says we want freedom for America , Cuba , Tibet , etc. , " he told his audience . " We want to destroy the Communists and want to live in freedom on our own terms , not on anyone else 's ! . . . " The American conservative , he went on , " stands today in the center of the political spectrum . To the left are  | the National Socialists , the Communists , New Deal , Raw Deal , Fair Deal , New Frontier and the Great Society . To the right is anarchy . We conservatives want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , he said , " there is no two-party press , there is no criticism of goon-ism , there is no criticism of give-aways , there is no criticism of crime , of Democrats and Republicans , of leftists or the press . " Much of the blame for this Courtney puts at the feet of conservatives . " We 've been active eating lunches , vigilant in keeping our money in our pockets and brave in retreating from the Communists , " he scolded . But , he added , that does not mean conservatives can not be successful . " Let us examine the statement New parties are never successful . ' Well , Norman Thomas ' Socialist Party was most successful ; it never got one electoral vote but it captured both the Democratic and Republican parties with its philosophy . " There arc four burning issues , Courtney went on , which the Conservative Party must solve . First , he said , " every American is a slave one day in five because he pays 20 percent in income taxes " ; second , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that must be rooted out ; third , America is financing her enemies , which must cease ; and fourth , the " Communist-dominated U.N . " must be opposed . " If we do n't win , " Courtney told his audience , " we 're going to be the best educated anti-Communists inside a concentration camp you ever saw . " To educate his conservative legions , Courtney publishes a wide variety of literature . As a third-party advocate , his best-known piece is a sixty-four-page booklet giving many useful tips on how to set up a new political party . Backing it up are slim pamphlets called Tax-Fax ? the highest number in my possession being No. 67 ? which give the CSA view of things . For instance , No. 5 , entitled " Nixon in ' 68 ? " is , according to the subtitle , " An Expose of the Leftwing Record of Richard Nixon , Possible Presidential Candidate of the Liberal-Controlled Republican Party . " Quoting from the Dan Smoot Report , US News &; World Report and Ralph de Tolcdano , Courtney pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypocrite and one who would " take  | a gamble " with America 's national security in order to coexist peacefully with the " aggression-crazed " Soviet Union . " The Income Tax Can Be Repealed ! " reads Tax-Fax No. 15 , giving a boost for the Liberty Amendment . " Communist Infiltration in Religion " is the title of Tax-Fax No. 31 , subtitled " Does the National Council of Churches Speak for You ? " Courtney 's source material is drawn entirely from right-wing sources such as Myers Lowman 's Circuit Riders , Inc. , books and articles by Billy James Hargis , Edgar C. Bundy , Fulton Lewis , Jr. , and HCUA . Tax-Fax No. 65 is called " Treason on the Campus " and asks " will the communists infect ' your son or daughter ? " Courtney 's answer is a very firm " yes " in view of the fact that such groups as the DuBois Clubs , Progressive Labor Party and Berkeley student " rioters " are tolerated . What the dedicated anti-Communist can do , suggests Courtney , is to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and send them to your congressman , senators , your children and relatives in college , professors , regents and members of the local board of education and youth groups . Both Courtneys are fervent members of the John Birch Society . In fact , Kent Courtney is a chapter leader in New Orleans . On occasion he feels that Robert Welch is too mild . For instance , when I asked him how he felt about the founder 's well-known remarks on Eisenhower , he said , " Hell , I pick up where Welch leaves off . " Part of the trouble , says Courtney , " is that people do n't believe us when we say that there is a conspiracy . . . . Buckley , for instance , says that the communists are not domestically dangerous , rather the mistakes come from misguided liberals . Well , anyone who knows how to read the reports of the House Un-American Activities Committee HCUA and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee can only come to the conclusion ? ' Yes , Mr. Buckley , there is a conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights activists and domestic Marxists . " Yes , I do believe you can tell a man by his associates , " he told the Baltimore congress . " Blackbirds fly together and redbirds fly together ; but recently both the redbirds and the blackbirds have been flying together . " He is particularly annoyed at the FCC 's " Fairness Doctrine , " which he thinks is not at all fair to him . Painstakingly , he said , " I  | outline the pro-communism of , say , Dr. Martin Luther King . Immediately the NAACP and other Federally-financed sic agencies demand equal time at government expense . They call us smearers , liars and fanatics . " Courtney has turned his ire on other targets . " Secretary of Defense McNamara , " he told the congress , " will go down in history as Secretary of No Defense ' ! " This remark was greeted by clapping and shouts of " Right ! " from the audience . " We 're no longer losing , ' says McNamara . What an inspiring piece of information that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter . " De Gaulle , " he said , " is a phony Communist and Francois Mitterand is a real Communist ! " Later on , when I interviewed Courtney in his old New Orleans office ( on one wall hung a portrait of General Robert E. Lee and on his desk were two phones , one of which he referred to as " the hot line " ) , he said , " There is nothing worse than a man such as Otto Passman who makes fine conservative speeches but then votes for foreign aid . I much prefer a man such as Hale Boggs who says he 's a liberal . At least he 's not a hypocrite . " Courtney still seems confused over how he should treat Barry Goldwater . Courtney was friendly in 1960 , but from 1961 to 1963 there was a coolness . Then he backed the Senator in 1964 , although he had his doubts , yet not before he , Courtney , had " nominated " Robert Welch for the Presidency on a third-party ticket . Yet , all in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could in 1964 . " The twenty-seven million votes , " he said , " is the maximum number of votes you could get for a philosophy . They the voters had to fight their way through a fall-out of torn Social Security cards to vote ! " But , in retrospect , Courtney is not so sure Goldwater was the best man . Governor Wallace , he told his audience , " was ready to run in thirty-six states if Goldwater had not been nominated . " Looking back , he added , " I wish Goldwater had not been nominated . " The man Courtney 's Conservative Parties nominate for President in 1968 will tell much of where his parties are headed in the future . The Congress of Conservatives that I attended brought to light many of the problems this third-party group faces . Besides the  | usual problems of qualifying for the ballot , building an organization and raising money , there are the hostility from the press , the skepticism of the voter and the " you can'ts " from the pessimists . Robert Schlachter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1965 , stood up and told the audience that a Conservative Party campaign might be called a " Robinson Crusoe campaign ? you think you 're all alone on the beach ; then you see a footprint . Well , that 's us ! " Schlachter , for one , has little regard for William Buckley 's candidacy for mayor of New York . Buckley , he said , " is the clown of conservatism , the Judas goat . If you are serious , get in there and fight ; if you want to play marbles , get out ! " These conservatives are convinced that there is no hope for the Republican Party . " They say the Republican Party is up ! " said Schlachter . " But how far more up can you go from the balcony ? You must be on the playing field ! " Another participant in the Congress was Harold P. Poeschel who runs the New Jersey Conservative Party . He attacked the Republican Party as a " legal ghost " that is " controlled by the internationalists . " Poeschel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1965 primary as an " Unreconstructed Republican . " He believes that the " international bankers seek to control the world , " along with the Council on Foreign Relations . He also believes that the U.S. Army is being trained in counterinsurgency to put down a revolt in America . In an effort to shake loose Republicans from their party he asked those assembled at the congress : " Which is more important to you , loyalty to your country or loyalty to your party ? " When you build in a city , he continued , " you need a wrecking crew as well as a builder . " It is high time , he said , for a new party to be built . He then strode to the front of the room and held aloft a few copies of a paperback book , saying that it should be read by all those who are tired of the present two-party alignment . The title of the book was It is HIGH TIME , the Case for a New Party , by Harold P. Poeschel . Courtney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to know that his conservative movement would be dead if they ever came into control . Several years ago he personally wrote to twenty-five people well known for their prejudice toward Jews ,  | Negroes and other minorities , and told them they were not welcome at an organizational meeting he was planning to hold in Chicago . Nevertheless , two female anti-Semites showed up and caused such a scene at the door that Courtney had them thrown out . On another occasion , a former member of the CSA , W. Henry MacFarland , Jr. , former head of the Nationalist Action League , became temporary chairman of the Conservative Party in Pennsylvania . When objections were raised because of his biased views , Courtney tried to get him to back down , which he refused to do . All tics were broken after two weeks of argument . " MacFarland is no longer a member of the CSA , " said Courtney , " because I returned his money . " The growth of the Conservative Party movement will depend on two factors , neither of which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first hinges on the fortunes of the Republican ( ' arty . If it collapses in the near future ( which it shows no sign of doing ) , Courtney may benefit . The second factor hinges on the John 13irch Society , which , in essence , is doing exactly what Courtney 's CSA and Conservative Party movement are doing except running men for office . As long as the Birch Society stays away from the hustings , Courtney 's organization will fill a need among right-wingers . If the two become competitors , however , there seems to be every indication that those who favor this type of activist-political organization would gravitate to the John Birch Society because it is larger , richer and better known than Courtney 's group . Courtney does not believe the Birch Society will join the third-party camp . His survival is based on the belief that more publicity can be garnered quicker and cheaper in an election than from the corporate promotional efforts of an organization such as the John Birch Society . This may bring many new recruits into these Conservative Parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3 The Conservative Party of New York deserves special attention because it is one of the few conservative groups that is a political  | reality . It was founded in 1962 for three major reasons . The first was to move the whole spectrum of New York politics to the right . " We Conservatives quit trying in 1962 to influence the Republican Party from within , " said Kieran O'Doherty , one of the Party 's founders . " We just could n't do it . " An independent , strong Conservative Party , he said , was the answer . The second reason , hinged to the first , was to eliminate the Liberal Party 's leverage by corralling the conservative vote , previously lost or at least dissipated by default . Thirdly , the formation of the Party reflected a reaction to " interest-group politics " ? the playing off of one group against another , long a staple of New York and American politics . The state chairman is J. Daniel Mahoney , a New York City attorney . His associates include David H. Jaquith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuccessful candidate for governor on the Party 's ticket in 1962 ; Suzanne LaFollette , a journalist and the niece of the late Senator Robert LaFollette ; Professor Henry Paolucci of Iona College , who ran unsuccessfully against Robert Kennedy and Kenneth Keating for senator in 1964 ; two writers for National Review , Frank S. Meyer and William F. Rickenbacker ; and Kieran O'Doherty , an attorney who looks like actor George C. Scott . O'Doherty , who ran unsuccessfully for senator in 1962 , was William Buckley 's campaign manager during the 1965 mayoralty race . The Party claims a working strength of 31,000 registered voters , split evenly between New York City and upstate . It claims another 15,000 who work for the Party but have not changed their old registration . Martin Burgess , Jr. , the Party 's executive director , said that no survey has ever been made of the type of people who join , but in his estimation the average Conservative is a middleclass homeowner , a policeman , a veteran , a Catholic in the city , a Protestant upstate . Conservatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exclusively the WASPs of Manhattan . For example , in the 1965 mayoralty race , candidate Buckley received 120,549 votes in Queens ( or 17.2 percent of those cast in that county ) , 20,427 votes in Richmond ( 25.1 percent ) , 62,988 in The Bronx ( 13.8 percent ) , 97,115 in Brooklyn ( 12.5 percent ) and 38,048 in Manhattan ( only 7.3 percent , well below the 13 percent overall vote he received ) .  | In the 1966 governor 's race , the Conservative Party outpolled the Liberal Party by 2,789 votes . Dr. Paul L. Adams , the Conservative candidate for governor and the dean of Roberts Wesleyan College near Rochester , edged out Franklin D. Roosevelt , Jr. , his Liberal opponent . Since the election of governor alone determines the order of precedence on the ballot in New York State , the Conservatives will be placed at least for the next four years on Line C and the Liberals will be dropped to Line D. To hold Line C on the ballot is considered to be of the utmost importance to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position affords them the opportunity to exercise a balance of power in the state . 1-low permanent is the Conservatives ' hold on Line C is difficult to say at the moment . Many of the 510,000 votes for Dr. Adams undoubtedly came from that section of the electorate which strongly opposed a referendum seeking to create a permanent Police Review Board in New York City . The Party 's militant stand against the Board was consistently pushed throughout the campaign , almost to the exclusion of other issues . One result was that the Conservatives outpolled the Liberals in their own stronghold of New York City ( since the Review Board issue was essentially a local one ) and lost to the Liberals upstate , a Conservative stronghold . Without such an issue to galvanize them , it remains to be seen whether the Conservative Party can consolidate its position on Line C four years hence and beyond . " The Liberal Party power , " said Burgess , " is totally unjustified when you consider how few races hinged on Liberal support ? Lindsay yes , but others no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1965 state assembly elections shows that , out of 76 districts in the New York City area , 56 were contested by Liberals and Conservatives . In only 46 percent , or 26 of the 56 districts , Conservatives outpolled the Liberals , but the total Conservative vote in these districts was slightly more than the total Liberal vote . Liberals held the balance of power in two districts , but it was not exercised . The Conservatives held the balance of power in five districts , and in one case these votes were crucial in electing a man to office . The results of the 1966 Congressional and local elections  | were similar , with particular improvements recorded in Queens and Richmond . The views of the Conservative Party of New York differ considerably from those of Kent Courtney and his group . The New York Conservatives seek a balanced state budget , no increase in taxes , a revision of unemployment insurance laws , the enactment of right-to-work laws , the repeal of any legislation that encourages featherbedding , no busing of schoolchildren , a return to the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent control , the requirement of one year 's residence to qualify for welfare , stronger laws and punishment for crimes of violence , and an end to public housing . There is virtually no evidence of a conspiracy complex within the Party , even though a number of Birchers are known to belong to it . The Party 's view towards small-1 liberals is that they are stumbling , bumbling , naive and fatuous individuals whose loyalty and good intentions are seldom questioned but whose mental probity and philosophical scope leave much to be desired . One persistent criticism of the Party is that its appeal is to racists , particularly the anti-Negro vote . Undoubtedly some of this criticism is justified , but in many cases it is overstated . Most of the criticism revolves around the Party 's opposition to the busing of schoolchildren . " We object to busing other ' students into worse ' schools , " said Burgess ; " we do not object to Negroes being bused to better ' schools . " Another Conservative put it this way : " The whole question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . It is questionable who is more race conscious , those who advocate busing or those who oppose it . For the Liberals to call us racists is absurd . " There is another conservative political group on the current scene . It is called the Constitution Party . It was founded in 1952 by a group of " nationalists " who objected to the nomination and eventual election of Dwight Eisenhower to the Presidency . Before long the Party was raided by a group of anti-Semites who were to  | dominate the Party until around 1960 when the more blatant ones were kicked out . The Party still has a racist flavor today but it is muted ; most members tend to be more circumspect in their criticism . In 1952 the Constitution Party ran General MacArthur for President in Texas and he received 3,089 votes ; in 1956 it backed ex-FRS Commissioner T. Coleman Andrews , who was also running on the States Rights Party ticket . In 1960 the Party was on the ballot in Texas and Washington . In Texas it ran Charles L. Sullivan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Washington , General Curtis was the Presidential candidate , thus running for both offices simultaneously. * Over 18,000 Texans voted for Sullivan , but Curtis could win no more than 1,401 votes in Washington . In 1964 the Party was only on the ballot in Texas . It ran Joseph B. Lid* , hthurn for President and Ted Billings for Vice-President . Lightburn is the grandson of Civil War General Joseph Lightburn and is currently a shopkeeper from Jane Lew , West Virginia . Lightburn , who is proud of the fact that his initials are the exact opposite of the current President 's , campaigned under the slogan " Let a Lightburn in the White House . " His running mate , Ted Billings , was born in Whitehouse , Ohio , and currently owns a health food store , Lifeguard Foods , in Denver . Together Lightburn and fillings polled 5,060 votes . The Party 's platform at first glance seems little different from that of any other extremely conservative group . Every issue of the Party 's monthly Newsletter , an eight-page pamphlet , usually carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **** Here It Is ? The World 's Greatest Platform ! **** " The Party advocates the repeal of many things : federal aid to education , the Civil Rights Act , the Mental Health Bill , the Sixteenth Amendment , the United Nations Treaty Act , the Disarmament Act , reciprocal trade agreements and GATT . It calls for the outlawing of the Council on Foreign Relations , breaking off diplomatic relations footnote Oddly enough , he has not been the only one to do so . Senator William E. Jenner was a candidate in 1956 for both President and Vice-Presidentin Texas for the Constitution Party , and in Kentucky for the States Rights Party respectively .  | with Communist countries , the suspension of " immigration beyond the quotas of the McCarran-Walter Act and the deportation of the millions of illegal entrants already in the United States " ; it calls for an annually balanced budget and the retirement of the U.S. debt . In a positive vein , the Party calls for the teaching of the free enterprise economic system in the schools , Bible reading in schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the withdrawal of government participation in business . But what makes the Party different from all the others is the emphasis it puts on two questions . Plank 1 reads : " THIS IS A CHRISTIAN NATION . . . nothing in the Constitution shall be construed so as to interfere with the free exercise of religion . " Exactly what the Party means by this is not clear , because the usual complaint over the abolition of prayers in public schools is , if anything , downgraded by the members . Party spokesmen constantly stress the point that " this is a Christian nation , . . . this is a Christian nation , . . . " but seldom offer to explain why they choose to emphasize the point at all . Some observers believe that the constant use of these words reflects either extremely narrow religious fundamentalism or thinly veiled racism . For instance , Bert Ellis , the Party 's chairman and a fire-extinguisher distributor by trade , wrote the following in a letter to Kent Courtney , his political opponent , in the fall of 1965 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pledge to love of God . But you need to be stronger in that regard . You need to use the words " Jesus Christ " or " Christian " to really let people know where you stand . As you probably know , Jesus Christ is the offense to the unbeliever . It is He who turns away the agnostic . Unitarians , the Theosophists , Moslems , Jews , Jehovah Witnesses , and many other religious sects believe in God , but do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as man 's personal savior . The original colonies in America were set up to edify the Lord Jesus Christ . Richard K. Troxell , the state chairman of the Constitution Party in Texas , believes that all past American laws have been Christian in character but that recently , he says , they have not been . " The  | government is no longer servant but master , " he said . " This is an Eastern philosophy and we are diametrically opposed to it . " One possible explanation for the emphasis on " Christian " is that Troxell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy " as the philosophy of the Anti-Christ . Thus , all who deny Christ ( not necessarily God ) , deny America . The second question that distinguishes this Party from others is its emphasis on " the money question , " which is usually expressed in the slogan " Buy Back the Federal Reserve . " To Ellis , this is one of the two most important issues of the times . This is a hoary argument that is similar in many ways to the current Greenback Party view . Essentially , Constitution Party members argue that the Federal Reserve System is a private corporation that is run for the sole benefit of " international financiers , " whom they name as " the Rockefellers , Rothschilds , Kuhn , Loch &; Company , etc . " " Warburg , " said Troxell , not making it clear to whom or what he was referring , " is number one among them . " The sole purpose of these international financiers , so Party members believe , is to control " the world 's monies . " The struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long and bitter one dating from the days of the Babylonian goldsmiths . Napoleon , members believe , was lured by the financiers to take over the world . He did not succeed . The American Civil War , they add , was started by international financiers to destroy this country and to gain control of its money . This , too , was unsuccessful . But the international financiers , they assert , finally did succeed in taking over the world in December 1913 when the Federal Reserve Act was passed . From then on the financiers have had things pretty much their own way , say the Constitutionalists : they control the United States because it is " in debt to the Federal Reserve " ; " they coin their own money " and have taken it " out of the hands of the people " ; they have created wars , depressions and revolutions to solidify their control over the monies of the world . One Party member recently told an audience that these financiers are encouraging the United Nations to step in and " regulate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calls for " Red Chinese troops to police ' the South . "  | The Party 's leading guru on the subject is a Houston insurance executive named Wickliffe B. Vennard , Sr. He wrote a book called The Federal Reserve Hoax in which he laid most of the country 's ills at the feet of " the International Zionists who steered our ships of state from Wall Street by means of money control . " Besides the international financiers and Zionists , Vennard believes that the " Illuminati , " Bilderberger conferences , Bandung conferences , the " Hidden Government , " the Council on Foreign Relations , communism and the Atlantic Union are also enemies of the United States . Vennard even thinks that anti-communism is a bankers ' racket : Hundreds of speakers are tirading from coast to coast denouncing Russia , communism , Socialism , United Nations , etc . They are aiding and abetting the International Bankers who constitute our Public Enemy No. 1 . . . . Their plan now is to sap the energies of Americans in an all-out hate campaign against Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia and Communists and says he knows what he is talking about is doing this country a great dis-service . To kill the octopus , we must aim at the heart . Nothing is accomplished by aiming at the tentacles . If all would concentrate upon the Repeal or Repurchase of the Federal Reserve System , when accomplished , all the other unAmerican activities would wither like leaves on a vine . Part of the reason the Constitution Party is considered racist is that two of its most enthusiastic boosters are well known in racist circles . One is Richard Cotten , a radio propagandist , an exBircher , an ex-member of Liberty Lobby and formerly a teacher at one of Billy James Hargis ' " Anti-Communist Youth Universities . " Cotton broadcasts his right-wing views ? similar to Constitution Party views ? over three Mexican and nineteen American radio stations at an estimated cost of $150,000 per year . Cotten was thrown out of the John Birch Society because of his allegiance to one Kilsoo Haan , a Korean prophet that Welch believed to be proRed , and because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed anti-Communist groups . The other booster is Ned Touchstone , the editor of The Councilor , mentioned previously . One issue of the Party 's Newsletter featured a double-page  | spread advertising a " GIANT RALLY " in Austin , Texas . The two noted speakers were to be Cotten and Touchstone . " Let 's give them a BIG Texas welcome ! " said the ad . Troxell , one of the spokesmen for the Party , is a young , handsome Texan who runs his own advertising ? public relations firm located in Houston . He is a graduate of Southern Methodist University who , by 1960 , " had gotten fed up with the Republican Party . " He joined the Constitution Party and has never regretted it . " I got fed up with people who compromise on everything , " he said . " I believe it is time to make a stand on what you believe like our forefathers did at the Alamo . " Although Troxell does not see the Constitution Party winning in 1968 , he does see the Party being on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he claims that twenty-eight states have Party organizations and are working to put candidates on the ballots . He believes , he told me , that the Party will he successful in his lifetime . According to Party literature , success will be achieved in the following nianncr : In the 1964 election , six people out of ten voted for President Johnson . In the future ( the literature optimistically says 1965 , but not even Troxell believes that ) , the Party sees the " socialist " Republicans and Democrats each getting three of the six votes for Johnson while the Constitution Party will get the remaining four . Although this would be a minority victory the Constitution Party is not disturbed because there would be no runoff . Each of the Party 's state organizations is near anarchic in character . Little allegiance is paid to the main office in Houston ; each Party draws up its own platform ; and none need adopt the official Constitution Party candidate if it does not want to . Until September 1965 the Maryland organization was run by retired Marine Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Defenders of the American Constitution , located in Florida. * ( Until his death in 1966 , DAC 's secretary was ex- footnote The DAC publishes Task Force , which periodically puts out " alerts . " In one alert , Del Valle wrote that the State Department is consciously surrendering U.S. sovereignty to the U.N . This means , he said , " we may ultimately expect that savage Congolese , Ghanians , Ethiopians and Ghurkas will maintain law and order ' in the United States , in the same manner as in Christian Katanga , by fire , murder and rapine. "  | Constitution Party candidate General Merritt B. Curtis . ) Del Valle was formerly vice-president of Merwin K. Hart 's National Economic Council and is a good friend of Robert Williams , publisher of the racist Know Your Enemy . The Iowa party is run by looseleaf book manufacturer Robert D. Dilley , who was originally set up in politics through the help of Kent Courtney . Dilley has since switched his allegiance to the Texas group . This party may now be using the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Independence Party label on it . The situation is very fluid in Iowa . The South Dakota party is run by a bearded doctor named Clarence S. Martin . His organization is known as the Christian Constitutional Party , and it stresses the Christian aspect of the platform . Martin offers fourteen slogans for his followers ? for instance , " God gave us two ears and one mouth , we should listen to God twice as much as speak to Him " ? as well as a " Creed , " a " Credo " and a " Call to Action . " The Pennsylvania organization is called the Constitutional Party and is run by an energetic and articulate individual named Edward S. Swartz . Swartz is the owner of Indian Echo Caverns , a tourist attraction twelve miles from Harrisburg . He campaigned for governor in 1966 under the slogan " Put a Cave Man in the Capitol . " The Florida affiliate , run by one Stanley Pospisil of Miami , is called ? just to confuse things ? the Conservative Party , because Kent Courtney 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freedom Ring , " registered the name " Constitution " before the Texas group could get around to it . This last action reflects the nature of the relations existing between Ellis ' and Courtney 's organizations . They have Veen feuding for years , each trying to outdo the other in order to become the undisputed leader of a third-party movement . " What is it , Mr. Courtney , that offends you about the Constitution Party ? " Ellis asked in an open letter . " Is it because you do n't run it ? " When I mentioned the feud to Courtney he said that the only differences were over policies , particularly Ellis ' position on the Federal Reserve . But it was obvious to me that there is more to it than that . Ellis also takes Courtney to task for supporting Goldwater ? the  | " false messiah " ? in 1964 . He also disagrees with Courtney over the latter 's belief that each state party should have only " temporary " chairmen so that when better-known leadership is found it can step in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and glorious party , " Ellis retorted , " so that it can be turned over to any false messiahs or stooges controlled by the International Bankers . " And as a last stab at his foe , he wrote : " I . . . will pray for your salvation and God 's forgiveness of your sin of supporting the AntiChrist . " The battle still rages .  | The first reaction one encounters when examining the activities of the four major Christian right groups ? Billy James Hargis ' Christian Crusade , Carl McIntire 's 20th Century Reformation Hour , Fred Schwarz 's Christian Anti-Communism Crusade , and Major Edgar C. Bundy 's Church League of America ? is that none of its leaders believe it fair to include their organizations in a political study . Each will say , in effect , " We are a Christian organization fighting the Anti-Christ ; therefore it is dishonest of you to call us political . " If communism were viewed by them exclusively as a religion then their point would be valid . Most Christian right literature , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as time has passed , the transparency of the religious-only claim has become all too apparent , and the cries of innocence sullied have become correspondingly less convincing . For better or for worse these groups and the others mentioned briefly below shall be considered to have a distinct political bias . The largest of these groups is Billy James Hargis ' Christian Crusade . Its gross receipts in 1964 were over $834,000 ( up 1440 percent from 1956 ) ; current operating costs run to $100,000 per month ; its news magazine , Christian Crusade , circulates among some 110,000 readers ; over one million pieces of literature are mailed out each month ( the yearly postal bill exceeds $75,000 ) ; Crusade speakers stump the country holding " Anti-Communist  | Leadership Schools " and " Anti-Communist Youth Universities " ; squads of advance men , front men and follow-up men fan out around the Crusade evangelists to ensure the maximum benefit from their appearances . Hargis himself usually spends twenty days a month speaking to various right-wing groups around the country ; his voice is heard on 270 radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array of motion pictures , television shows , books , tape recordings , tracts , pamphlets and record albums ; and the Crusade operates , among other things a hotel , a thirty-five-foot executive motor coach and a $1 million " cathedral . " Billy James Hargis , the man leading this crusade , has been a minister in the Christian Church ( Church of Christ ) since he was eighteen years old . Ile was born in Texarkana , Texas , in 1925 and after his graduation from high school attended Ozark Bible College at Bentonville , Arkansas . Although he spent but one and a half years there he was nevertheless ordained a minister in his church . he then held successive pastorates in Granby , Missouri , Sallisaw , Oklahoma , and Sapulpa , the latter a suburb of Tulsa . Throughout these years he became more and more alarmed over what he considered to be an indifferent attitude of the Protestant clergy toward communism . He was further disturbed by their apparent apostasy . In 1950 , he resigned his post and within a year had founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Ministry ? a " religious , non-profit-making body " whose purpose it was to awaken America to the threat of communism . The name Christian Crusade was to evolve later when it became apparent that the name Christian Echoes National Ministry had no appeal to those people Hargis wanted to reach . Two years after he founded the Crusade , in 1953 , Hargis received his first nationwide publicity when he launched his " Bible Balloon Project . " During the five years that this operation was supported by the Crusade , over one million portions of the Bible , translated into seven languages , were launched via balloon into Iron Curtain countries . In 19.55 , he preached a sermon on Easter Sunday before the Tomb of Christ in Jerusalem and was asked to return and repeat his efforts on another occasion , which he did . In 1957 , he took a  | trip around the world , during which he met Syngman Rhee ( a " brilliant world leader " ) and Madame Chiang ( " the most powerful single Christian force in today 's world " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again on the front pages of the newspapers . This time it was over what has come to be called " the Air Force manual affair . " This incident came to a head the previous month when the Air Force issued a manual for the training of noncommissioned officers in the Air Force Reserve . Part of the text read as follows : " Communist fellow travellers and sympathizers have successfully infiltrated our churches . . . . There appears to be overwhelming evidence of communist antireligious activity in the United States through the infiltration of fellow travellers into churches and educational institutions . " The document then went on to say : " The National Council of Churches of Christ in the United States of America officially sponsored the Revised Standard Version of the Bible . Of the 95 persons who served in this project , 30 have been affiliated with procommunist fronts , projects and publications . " ' - The man who wrote this section of the manual was one Homer T. Hyde , a Baptist and a civilian whose knowledge of communism among the Protestant clergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject . The minister suggested contacting Hargis , which Hyde then did . Hargis sent Hyde two small pamphlets he had written ? " Apostate Clergymen Battle for GodHating Communist China " and " The National Council of Churches Indicts Itself on 50 Counts of Treason " ? plus one pamphlet from Myers Lowman 's Circuit Riders , Inc. , entitled " 30 of the 95 Men Who Gave Us the Revised Standard Version of the Bible . " These three pieces of literature provided the documentation for Hyde 's critical remarks . The NCC complained of the attack in a letter to Thomas S. Gates , the Secretary of Defense . Gates was embarrassed by this development and withdrew the document from circulation . The New York Times was to remark that " something is wrong in our defense organization when this kind of venomous nonsense can be put out at Government expense . " The uproar caused considerable publicity to fall the way of Billy James Hargis . Ever since that day his organization has grown to  | the point where it is now the largest one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from the Defender Seminary in Puerto Rico . This organization was founded by the late Reverend Gerald B. Winrod , a Wichita-based propagandist who published The Defender , a magazine that flourished in the 1930s and 1940s and which was openly hostile to Jews . Winrod was so pro-German during the late 1930s that he became known as " the Jayhawk Nazi . " He subsequently was indicted for sedition three times , but the charges were dropped after the presiding judge died during the trial . Hargis received his BA two years later from Burton College and Seminary in Manitou Springs , Colorado , and in 1958 he was to be given a Bachelor of Theology degree from the same institution . In 1957 , Belin Memorial University , then located in Chillicothe , Missouri , and now in Manassas , Virginia , awarded Hargis an honorary Doctor of Laws degree . According to the Department of Health , Fducation and Welfare , both Burton and Belin Colleges are " degree mills , " organizations that award degrees without requiring students to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1959 , Dr. Clyde Belin , the head of the latter college , was sentenced to a one-year term in federal prison on six counts of using the mails to defraud . The Crusade family is large and diversified . One of Hargis ' associate evangelists is the Reverend David A. Noebel , a thirtyone-year-old native of Wisconsin who once ran for Congress in a primary election against Democrat Robert Kastenmeier of the 2nd District . Noebel joined Christian Crusade in 1964 and is considered to be the back-up man for Hargis . Recently Noebel wrote a pamphlet called Communism , Hypnotism and the Beatles , in which he argued that the Communists have a master music plan for American youth designed to make them mentally ill and emotionally unstable . This master music plan involves rhythmic , beat and folk music . The Reverend Charles V. Secrest is another associate evangelist and is Hargis ' brother-in-law . Dr. Fernando Penabaz , Hargis ' biographer ( Crusading Preacher from the West ) and a Cuban refugee , serves as the Director of International Affairs for the  | Crusade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trustee of the organization . The Crusade 's advisers include two members of the Birch Council : Tom Anderson and F. Gano Chance , the latter of the A. B. Chance Company . Four other well-known advisers are Robert D. Dilley of Des Moines ; Dr. Bob Jones , Jr. , the president of Bob Jones University in Greenville , South Carolina ; Brigadier General Richard B. Moran from Kerrville , Texas ; and General Charles A. Willoughby , one of the most ardent of all supporters . General Willoughby was Chief of Intelligence for-General Douglas MacArthur during World War II and the Korean War . He writes a column called " Foreign Intelligence Digest " for Christian Crusade magazine . Willoughby thinks so much of Hargis that he gave him an elaborately engraved five-foot sword from the Crusades that had been presented to Willoughby by General Franco of Spain . One of the most important men in the Crusade is L. E. " Pete " White , a Tulsa advertising man who had previously been employed by Oral Roberts , the " faith healer " of TV fame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a multimilliondollar enterprise but then fell out over money . Shortly thereafter White was approached by Hargis , then at his Sapulpa pastorate . White took on the job of promoting Hargis and has been largely responsible for the growth of the Crusade that followed . White 's name only appears as editor of Christian Crusade ; he is not a trustee nor an official adviser but is nevertheless very close to Hargis ' ear . Hargis has no single large contributor to the Crusade . However , one individual , the late W. L. Foster , a Tulsan who made millions in oil leases , lent Hargis as much as $500,000 at no interest to get started . Foster also was a contributor to such groups as Liberty Lobby , We The People ! ( of which Hargis was the president for two years ) , the United States Day Committee and Gerald L. K. Smith 's operations . Most money , however , comes pouring in as the result of the multitudinous appeals that flow out of the Crusade 's Tulsa headquarters . The activities of the Crusade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week Hargis broadcasts his " antiCommunist message " over 270 radio stations . His Sunday broadcast , he said , is " spiritually oriented . " On occasion he will hold  | radio marathons , eight-hour shows exclusively concerned with the " Communist problem . " They are usually beamed to the public over two powerful Mexican radio stations , XEG in Monterrey and XERB in San Diego . No one seems to know how many people hear Hargis ' messages , but all agree that the audience is huge . In 1964 , 10.5 percent of Crusade income came in through radio appeals . The Crusade has produced 26 fifteen-minute color films suitable for both TV and theatres . Subjects discussed include the Supreme Court , churches of America , foreign aid , state sovereignty and Communist subversion in the U.N . They feature such stars as Captain Fddie Rickenbacker , John Rousselot , Barbara Hartle and Benjamin Gitlow , the latter two ex-Communists . Tape recordings of Hargis ' speeches are offered to the public at five dollars per tape . Hargis also sells 33-rpm phonograph records . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it Be ? , " " The United Nations Hoax , " " Jesus Christ ? The Hope of the World " and " Songs and Sayings of Billy James Hargis . " Book publishing is also big business with the Crusade . The books are cheap paperbacks most of which have no index or source notes . In 1962 , Hargis published The Facts About Communism and Our Churches and Communism , The Total Lie , which he claims together sold more than 48,000 copies in two years . The Real Extremists ? the Far Left was published in 1964 and , according to Hargis , sold 35,000 copies in the first four months after publication . Letter writing is a major means by which the Crusade raises money . Hargis believes in the long , folksy letter that is full of inside information on the Crusade . When it comes to emotions , few plugs are left unpulled . A July 1962 letter on blue stationery in the handwriting of Betty Jane Hargis , Billy James ' wife , told of the pressure on the Hargis children caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't each of you help to relieve some of this pressure by your contributions ? " She promised to send each contributor " a snapshot of Billy and the children " if they wanted one . On another occasion , the Weekly Crusader announced bluntly in bold red ink : " THIS PUBLICATION WILL BE DISCONTINUED AS OF OCTOBER 1 , 1962 UNLESS . . . "  | Hargis ' letters are personal and emotional . " I am indignant , angry , aroused ! " began one . " Deep inside me I am seething with resentment over the lack of support for our boys in South Vietnam . Perhaps you can sense the white heat of emotion in my words . Oh , the shame of it ! " The letter went on to say that Hargis was planning " to saturate the nation with an eye-catching bumper strip " reading " We Back Our Boys in Vietnam " ( with the Crusade name and address printed below ) . Along with a plea to buy a minimum of twenty-five bumper stickers ( at $6.25 ) , Hargis added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , he explained , would go to " Project Clean Slate , " an effort to pay off radio stations which have been carrying Hargis ' debts indefinitely . The FCC , said Hargis , was trying to prove that these stations were biased in favor of him , which he thought would put the station licenses in jeopardy . Hargis also raises money by a technique that some call a " prayer auction . " The first recorded auction took place in August 1961 at a time when the Mutual Broadcasting Company offered the Crusade a six-month special low rate " for only $38,870 . " At the 3rd Annual Crusade Convention that year in Tulsa , Hargis stood up before the seven hundred people in the audience and cried : " I pray to God for one man to sponsor this program for six months . I know that man exists in the audience . Will he stand up ? " No one stood up so Hargis continued : " Alright then , we will divide this burden . I need four men who will accept God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This met with more success as two men stood up . Hargis continued : " Give us four , oh , God , who will give $5,000 each . Quickly . $2,000 ? " One man stood up . " . . . One thousand dollars ? " Three men stood up . In the end , after calling for contributions of $500 through $100 , Hargis found that seventy-nine men had pledged the exact amount needed.2 Hargis uses other money-raising techniques . He sells 100 back copies of Christian Crusade for $3 and $20-chairs for $100 as a memorial in his new " cathedral . " Two of the smallest money-raising operations , but nevertheless two that receive the most publicity , are his Christian Crusade AntiCommunist Youth University and his Anti-Communist Leadership  | Schools . The Youth University is located in Manitou Springs , Colorado , in the Crusade-owned Summit Hotel and offers six twoweek seminars for students over fourteen years old . According to one issue of Christian Crusade , " These seminars are designed to give a well-rounded education to students in the areas of Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , economics . We cover specifics like the National Council of Churches , the Marxist United Nations , disarmament , etc . " The article goes on to say that " we are able to judge and weigh the burning issues through the spectrum of truth ? the Bible . " Besides Hargis , Penabez and Noebel , the 1966 faculty included Frank L. Kluckhohn , a former New York Times reporter and author of such books as America : Listen ! and Lyndon 's Legacy ; Dr. Grace Levinson , head of the Voice Department at Bob Jones University ; and General Fdwin A. Walker , who is described as " the unmuzzled Army officer . " The Anti-Communist Leadership Schools , however , are better known and better attended . Limited to some 150 " constitutional conservatives , " the school lasts five days and costs $125 per person , not including literature bought . The most famous of the schools was held in Tulsa in 1962 . At the opening session Hargis warned that no intemperate statements from the floor or platform would be tolerated . This warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty , Dr. Revilo Oliver , from calling liberal intellectuals " witch doctors and fakers with a sanctified itch to save the world " who , in addition , are taxing America to death for the benefit of every " mangy cannibal in Africa . " He went on to describe Drew Pearson as " one of the biggest , slimiest rats in the sewers of American journalism . " ( Pearson is particularly hated by Crusaders because he once accused Hargis of peddling vitamin pills , which the evangelist denied . However , Christian Crusade at one time did carry ads for a food supplement called Nutri-Bio , which was seized in 1961 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as being " of no value in the treatment or prevention of any of the diseases which commonly occur in this country . " ) Oliver also lashed out at Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. , calling him a " mountebank and shyster , " and at Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara , whom he termed a " former socialist professor . "  | Another speaker at the school was R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is active in the Citizens ' Councils . He caused a considerable fuss when he attacked the Negro race as being biologically and intellectually inferior to the Caucasian . He added that the major difference between American Negroes and Negroes in the Congo was that " in the Congo they eat more people than they do in the United States . " Even Hargis winced at this remark . The 1966 Anti-Communist Leadership School which I attended for three days was clearly not as provocative as the 1962 school , but nevertheless it presented a good cross-section of the Crusade , its followers and its ideas . Hargis , of course , is the star attraction . Physically , at six feet and an estimated 270 pounds , he is one of the larger leaders on the right . His girth is enormous , but he is surprisingly light on his feet . He also looks much younger than news media photographs make him appear . He lives in a $45,000 " parsonage " and has a 700-acre ranch outside of Tulsa . Like the President of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His wife 's name is Betty Jane and his four children are named Bonnie Jane , Billy James , Becky Jean and Brenda Jo . Hargis calls everyone by his first name and collectively " Brother . " He sprinkles his language with colloquialisms , familiarities and Biblical quotes . " You folks go over and fellowship in the dining room after the meeting . . . , " he told a group of Crusaders during the school . " Honey , " " dear hearts " and " y'all " are other favorite forms of address . " Praise God , " " Thank the good Lord Jesus " and " God of our Fathers " are typical of his religious expressions . His favorite quotation is from Ephesians 6:12 : " For we wrestle not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness in high places . " Hargis can keep an audience amused with a seemingly endless collection of jokes and stories . He flatters his followers with compliments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jolly laugh , and he is a powerful platform speaker who can make a two-hour speech seem like a twenty-minute sermon . His style is informal and can vary from spontaneous bursts of humor to foot-stomping ,  | table-pounding shouts of anger . He objects to being tagged as a " bawl and jump " evangelist . He has developed a taste for travel , particularly to Europe and the Holy Land . Few years have passed since the founding of the Crusade that he has not gone to Europe or Jerusalem . Hargis also has a taste for fine clothes . The day I interviewed him he was wearing a tan smoking jacket with a velvet collar . There is no doubt that his followers adore him . I have seen elderly female crusaders break into helpless giggles of pleasure when Hargis flatters or teases them . He is a back-patter and a handsqueezer . Such is his spell over some individuals that they seem eager to carry their checkbooks around at port arms . Entire families follow the Hargis line . One family from the Texas Panhandle said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hargis has ever held . Their children had attended the Youth University , and they work hard for the Crusade in their hometown . Their attractive daughter confided in me that her entire family were being persecuted by their hometown neighbors because of their views and associations . One elderly woman said to me , not making it clear to whom she was referring : " I 'm glad my captain never lost a battle ! " Others listen to his speeches with rapt attention , muttering , " That 's right ! " or " A-men ! " or " Hear , hear ! " at whatever pleases them . One white-haired woman at the school fell into a trance during Hargis ' speech and expressed her agreement with his views with arm motions similar to those of an orchestra conductor . Hargis ' views differ only slightly from those of other groups on the right . He favors reduced taxes , a greatly reduced bureaucracy , a sound dollar , the elimination of foreign aid , the withdrawal of government from business , a return to states ' rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diplomatic relations with Communist countries , the fostering of patriotism , sound economics and " time-honored virtues . " He opposes inflation , " legislation by the Judiciary , " socialism and federal involvement in schooling , housing and voting . He also believes that segregation was ordained by God . A common theme running through all his political positions is  | " we have been betrayed . " The biggest traitors he believes to be " liberals , welfare staters , do-gooders and one-worlders . " The Communists have infiltrated , he claims , the churches , Congress , the Pentagon , the newspapers , TV , magazines , foundations , the Supreme Court and labor unions . As Hargis sees it , their job is to smear patriots such as himself . Things are so bad , the betrayal has been so complete , believes Hargis , that the Communists will take over the country by 1974 . The 1966 Anti-Communist Leadership School was held in Tulsa at the Western Village Motel near the edge of town . Hargis ' Crusade had leased the Village with an option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retirement home for elderly Crusaders . It soon became apparent , however , that the project would never pay for itself , and both the option to buy and the lease were eventually dropped . Nevertheless , the Crusade was running the motel at the time the Leadership School was being held , and it packed the rooms with sixty to eighty guests , many of whom had traveled from far afield to attend the sessions . Attendance , said Ruby White ( the wife of Pete White ) , had been cut because of the bad winter weather . For the most part , all the guests were individuals well past their forties . Only a few young people were present . The most noticeable aspect of the school was the amount of literature for sale . No matter where one went there was a rack of literature with an individual standing nearby to collect money . In the motel lobby there was a rack of slim pamphlets for which the Crusade is famous . Some of the titles are The Strange Death of Povl Bang-Jensen , Should We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truth About Drew Pearson and Why I Left the Armed Forces , by Major General Edwin Walker , who refers to himself as " USA ( resigned ) . " Over in the dining room there was another rack , this one slightly larger , carrying vast quantities of Crusade and Birch Society literature as well as general right-wing favorites such as John Stormer 's None Dare Call It Treason and Phyllis Schlafly 's and Admiral Chester Ward 's Strike From Space . But it was at the entrance to the meeting hall where the racks and the tables were the biggest . Besides the Crusade and Birch Society material there  | were such items as Bibles ( some of which had brightly colored plastic covers ) , Christian Crusade bookends , plastic trash containers ? with the Crusade stamp ? for the automobile , and a number of framed photographs of Billy James Hargis . One picture showed him posed before a painting of Christ , with a parchment copy of the Constitution in his hands , an American flag to one side , and a Crusader in armor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another picture featured Hargis on a horse . Also for sale was literature from Myers Lowman 's Circuit Riders , Inc. , and the House Committee on Un-American Activities . A " General Walker Package " sold for one dollar , but was sealed so that there was no way of knowing what was inside . Subsequent inspection revealed that the packet contained eight single-sheet flyers ( two of which were identical ) and eight small pamphlets , six of which were under eight pages . A full range of records were also available . Some of them were selling quite briskly . The couple who stayed next to me at the motel , for instance , played " The Songs and Sayings of Billy James Hargis " over and over again far into the night . Tape recordings of the speeches delivered at the 1966 School could be ordered immediately following the talk itself . Any combination of fifteen speeches could be had for fifty dollars . The first speaker I heard at the 1966 school was Dr. W. O. H. Garman , the minister of the Callendar ( Presbyterian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former public relations man and a past president of Carl McIntire 's American Council of Christian Churches , an anti-NCC group . Garman 's topic at the school was " The Folly of Disarmament . " He said that he himself on occasion carries a gun and that he had taught two of his three children to shoot by the age of two . At six years , he claimed , his son could shoot a .45 " very well . " His talk continued on this line for some time then dwelt on " fuzzy thinkers and traitors " who put Castro in power in Cuba " . . . and the Reds in power in the Dominican Republic . " The Bible , he said , " is not with these fuzzy men " ( " A-men , " said Hargis from the back of the room ) . Winding up his speech on the subject of civil rights riots , he told the audience that if any Negro " tried to molest my wife or children , my gun 's coming out smoking ! " As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that " they should have been gunned down ! " Immediately following Garman came David Noebel , who spoke on " The Foreign Policy of the National Council of Churches . " Noebel is a powerful speaker , building each point to a crescendo and then stopping suddenly to let the words sink in . The NCC , he said , was composed of " wolves in sheep 's clothing " who have been calling for the collectivization of America since 1912 . But the roots , he said , go deeper than that . " Bolshevism and Fabianism emanate from Marx and they came together in the NCC . " Much of the radicalism in the churches , he added , came out of the ? and here the slip was intentional ? " Union Theological Cemetery . " Because he believes that all Russian Orthodox priests are KGB spies , he asked : " Do you remember the time the Orthodox priest 's beard fell off in Jerusalem ? " The audience nodded knowingly . He then suggested a campaign to give peaceniks gasoline and matches . Noebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does the National Council of Churches speak for you , " he asked , " when it advocates the recognition of Red China ? " There were murmurs of " No ! " from the audience . " Does the National Council of Churches speak for you , " he continued , " when its leadership endorses the abolition of the House Committee on Un-American Activities ? " Again there were fervent murmurs of " No ! " from the audience . " . . . When it supports the law-violating Freedom Riders ' in the South ? . . . when its leadership requests clemency for convicted communist spies ? . . . when it helps sponsor and train agitators for the invasion of one of our sovereign states ? . . . when it endorses the unionization of farmers ? . . . when it accepts a cash gift of $200,000 from the CIO ? . . . when it supports the extension of the Reciprocal Trade Act ? " Each time the cries of " No ! " became louder and more pronounced . The NCC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . It is the single greatest fifth column force within the borders of the United States ! " The next morning Fernando Penabaz spoke on " The Case of Rhodesia . " ( The applause following his introduction was countered by a " B000 ! " from Hargis , who had just walked into the room at that moment . The audience and Penabaz broke out into  | laughter . ) Penabaz began his speech by giving the details of an elaborate conspiracy in which Fidel Castro was supposed to have sent an agent to Zanzibar to take over the country so that the Cubans could get their hands on the American missile-tracking station there . According to Penabaz , the station was dismantled and is now in Cuba . Moving on to other subjects he said : " And just what is this thing called World Opinion ? Most people in the world have no opinion at all ! " Eventually he came around to the subject of Rhodesia , whose policies of segregation and exclusion he endorsed . The attack against Rhodesia , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound , " was being spearheaded by the leaders of Ghana , Algeria , Egypt and Ethiopia . " Rhodesia is not the main target , as you know , . . . " he said ; the real one is South Africa . On the subject of apartheid , he said : " Kennedy will tell us not to he segregated ; but just try to climb over the ten-foothigh wall of their mansion in Palm Beach and see what happens to you . . . and you do n't have to be black to have this happen to you ! " We live , he sighed , " in the silliest era man has ever lived in . That evening Dr. Charles Poling and General Richard B. Moran spoke to the school . Poling comes from a famous ecclesiastical family . His brother Daniel is editor of Christian Herald ; another brother is pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Salem , Oregon ; a third brother was one of four chaplains who gave their lives in World War II when the U.S.S. Dorchester was torpedoed ; his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was soloist for Dwight Moody . The topic of Charles Poling 's speech was " Tears Become Us Now . " Our country , he said , " is in trouble , real trouble . We are closer to losing our freedom than we realize . We have been squandering our days crying It ca n't happen here ! ' " Like most right-wingers , Poling resents being called " sick , " " extremist , " " mentally unbalanced " or " politically unreal . " He , for one , makes fun of the charges leveled at him . For instance , he would sometimes preface his remarks with " Since the NCC has just declared me senile ' and sick ' . . . " On one occasion he said : " I 'm not a lunatic but I 'm an extremist because I 'm extremely right ! "  | There has been , he continued , " a move to impeach Earl Warren . I think that 's silly . I think we should impeach the whole bunch in Washington . " The primary purpose of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America to get us back on the path of Pilgrim character . " General Moran , the chairman of the Crusade 's advisory board , spoke next on the United Nations . He traced the history of the " one world idea " back to the eighteenth century and the Rothschild family . Their purpose , he said , was to control the world , and they were to do this by being trained from childhood to attach themselves to rulers as advisers . This , he added , " has been true since 1773 right up to today and Walt Rostow . " The Rothschilds , he explained , needed an organization through which they could control the world . They tried the League of Nations , but the Senate would not buy it . " However , " he said , " after World War II , they succeeded in the United Nations . . . . " Moran had other doubts about the U.N . Its charter , he said , is " anti-God " ; it is trying to create a " Universal Brown Man ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ; and , he concluded , there is no reference to the rights of private property in the charter . The major speaker at this Leadership School was General Walker . Because of other commitments I was unable to hear him , but I did meet him briefly . He has become the number one folk hero of right-wingers ? not only because of his enforced retirement from the Army in 1961 but also because of the treatment he received at the hands of the federal authorities during the University of Mississippi riots in 1962 . Most right-wingers believe Walker was railroaded into a mental institute to be brainwashed because he was a threat to the " pro-Red status quo . " Walker himself has the reputation as the right 's worst public speaker , often becoming incoherent when he mounts the podium . But in private this is not so ; he is fairly articulate and not given to the monosyllabic anti-Communist cliches he sometimes uses in public . The two topics on which he spoke to the school were entitled " Moscow vs . Tulsa " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' speech the next day was one of three he gave that week . All three speeches were related . This topic was  | entitled " Political Planning for Victory over Communism . " The previous one and the final one , neither of which I heard , were entitled " Spiritual Planning for Victory . . . " and " Educational Planning . . . " The following excerpts are from the second speech : " I am a Christian conservative today , " he began , " because only conservatism in the United States espouses the philosophy of Christ . . . . The liberal churches today preach a social gospel . This is misnamed ; it 's really a socialist gospel . Or , in the common vernacular , they preach the gospel according to Martin Luther King instead of the gospel according to Matthew , Mark , Luke and John . . . . " I believe the Bible is inspired , I believe it 's God 's word , I believe in heaven and hell , I believe in God and Satan , I believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , I believe America was God 's greatest nation under the living Sun and the ideal of governments , and I believe the only hope to maintain freedom is this orthodox Christian traditionalist viewpoint . . . . " Then you have the anti-communists who say I would rather be dead than Red ' and I 'm one of those that say that . I would rather see my children . . . I would rather make the choice . . . and I would n't hesitate to make the choice : I would rather see my children destroyed and my life destroyed , my wife 's life destroyed in a nuclear bombing than the thought of them having to live under a communist slave state . This would n't be living , this would be hell on earth and death would be merciful ! shouts of " Right ! " from the audience . . . " Now my friends , if you do n't think that . . . world government is the goal then you had better become convinced on that one point or you will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is their goal : world government , as fantastic as it sounds . . . . " I have lived through liberalism since the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and I have seen my country go bankrupt economically ; and I 've seen our churches become apostate ; and I 've seen our schools emphasize internationalism instead of nationalism and even turn against the faith of our fathers . I 've seen this country in the name of progress become a bankrupt ? morally and eco-  | nomically ? republic and it 's not even a republic any longer . I 'm afraid that we have the seeds of a dictatorship in Washington , D.C. , today " A-men , " " Hear , hear ! " and I 'm concerned and I have a right to be concerned and as long as I live I will express that concern . . . . " As I have already told you in Ezekiel and Revelations both , the Anti-Christ builds a world government and a world church . It 's built on compromise and appeasement ; it 's built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on principles . . . . You do n't achieve ecumenical unity without compromise and compromise is evil ! " A-men ! A-men ! " . . . Internationalism , liberalism , welfare statism , Marxism , fascism , communism , Nazism is nothing but an attack upon a man 's correct relationship with God . It is concealed atheism . . . . " Hargis can use humor to good effect . For instance , he said this about his critics who attacked his own opposition to the " God is dead " school : " It 's not hate to declare war on God , " he began , " it 's only hatred when you declare war on those who declare war on God . . . . In other words , my friends , we 've got to learn who to hate and who to love . Now you can hate certain people and it 's love . But you can love certain people and it 's hate . I am therefore in favor of our getting a petition up ? many of you have signed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we need a new petition . And I think that we need to petition the liberals of both political parties to give us a new dictonary that tells us who to hate and who to love because we want to be in step . I want to know who to hate because apparently I 'm hating some of the wrong people laughter . And if you hate the right person it 's love , do n't you see ? more laughter . . . " Later on , Hargis turned serious again . With considerable emotion in his voice , he said : " Do n't talk to me of liberalism ! It is a double-standard , Satanic hypocrisy ! " Cries of " A-men ! " followed by loud clapping . Hargis continued : " The only people that I ever met in my life that I think are worth knowing are these little of Bible-believing Christian people who love the Lord and who love America and they 're willing even in their feeble way to the best of their ability to give their lives in the defense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people I want to know , and they 're the ones I want  | to hold my hand as I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death . " Hargis spent over half his speech talking about problems that face his Crusade . He believes that the federal government is out to squelch any criticism of the consensus . General Walker , J. Edgar Hoover , Barry Goldwater , Robert Welch , Fred Schwarz , Carl McIntire , George Benson and himself , in his own estimation , are the prime targets to be destroyed . Walter Reuther , says Hargis , is behind the assault because he is " perhaps the most powerful man in the United States . " He controls , adds Hargis , " the largest bloc vote in the United States and now indirectly controls the second largest bloc vote ? the Negro vote . . . . " Hargis is also a big critic of the press . He is particularly nettled by what he considers to be lack of objectivity . Quoting from a newsclipping , 3 he said to the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy James Hargis ' Christian Crusade program in November 1964 attacked Fred J. Cook of Interlaken , New York New Jersey , a free-lance writer . ' Now you want to hear objectivity in news reporting ? " Hargis asked . " Listen to the coming line : ' Cook had criticized . . . ' ? now notice , Fred Cook had ' criticized . ' Is n't that sweet ? It 's gentle , American , Christian , humane . . . . Cook had criticized the conservative Hargis operation . ' Now notice , Hargis had attacked ' Fred J. Cook , but Cook had criticized ' Hargis ' operation in a magazine article called ' Radio Right : Hate Clubs of the Air . ' Now that 's criticism . To refer to me as operating a Hate Club , ' that 's criticism ; but when I expose Fred Cook , that 's an attack . You see , dear friends , you do n't know who to hate . " Hargis went on to tell of his financial troubles in 1961 . Contributions , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him appeared in the national press . He told how he went into debt to his numerous radio stations to the tune of $300,000 and how some of his fair-weather friends kept writing him , saying , " You fool , this is where you went wrong . . . " He explained the " hell on earth " he went through in 1962 to drag the Crusade out of the red ? how he turned to General Walker in desperation and how they both together stumped the country in a money-raising speak-  | ing tour called " Operation Midnight Ride . " The debt today , he said , was down to $100,000 and was to be paid off as soon as possible . " I shall never forget , " he said , " what Ted Walker did for me . " In private , Hargis is little different from his public image : folksy , energetic and pungent . He said that " the press 's habit of using the guilt-by-association technique galls me to the core . " He showed me a clipping of an article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioning Hargis . He is particularly irritated by the portrait painted of him by the authors of Danger on the Right , a book sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League . " I ca n't respond to it for fear of being labelled anti-Semitic . So it 's a form of dictatorship , " he said . The Internal Revenue Service , after investigating the Crusade 's tax-free status for several years , revoked the privilege in 1966 . The IRS charged that part of Hargis ' operations were " directed at the accomplishment of political objectives including efforts to influence political action by the public and government and only remotely , if at all , accomplish any educational , religious or charitable objective . " It also charged that the Crusade 's activities had in effect given direct or indirect support to candidates . Hargis denies all this . He believes that the IRS ? and the FCC ? are being used to coerce him off the air and out of business . He believes that within three years he will no longer have any freedom of speech . Hargis told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status , that if his tax-free status were not upheld , he planned to file six " People 's Suits " against the NCC , Christian Century magazine , Motive ( a Methodist magazine ) , the United Church Herald ( of the United Churches of Christ ) , the Fellowship of Reconciliation and the NAACP ( only one section of which has a tax-deductible status ) . They will , says Hargis , be charged with trying to influence legislation and , except for the FOR , with supporting LBJ in 1964 . In any event , he says he will ask his supporters to continue to send their contributions to his Christian Crusade Church , another deductible organization of his . Perhaps what bothers Hargis the most is that his new tax status may balloon his postal bill , now approximately 7.5 percent of his  | costs , into one third of his total costs . This would inhibit him considerably . During the five-day Leadership School , Hargis gave all the guests a tour of his plant ( the bus used for transportation from building to building had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication and mailing facilities are perhaps the most extensive on the right ? except for the John Birch Society . The Crusade owns a $35,000 mailing machine , $27,000 worth of tape-duplicating equipment , a number of letter-writing machines , a signature-signing machine , extensive printing equipment , a 20,000-book library ( part of which was purchased from Allen Zoll , the former leader of American Patriots , Inc. ? a " fascist " group , according to the Attorney General 's list of subversive organizations ) , and there are rows upon rows of name index plates ready to be fed into the addressing machine . In addition there are files on Communists , " NC ( ' pinks " and fellow travelers . There is $35,000 worth of stock in readiness at any one time ? books , pamphlets , Bibles , and tape recordings of some five hundred anti-Communist speakers . Over seventy individuals handle the work , and the frantic atmosphere reminded me of the mailroom at Sears , Roebuck around Christmas time . In another part of Tulsa is the Christian Crusade Cathedral , a concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has no front or back , Hargis said , nor will it have any choir . Hargis would rather hire two professional gospel singers because if he did not like them he could fire them . This way , he noted , reflecting on the experience he had in his previous pastorates , he would not be stuck with hometown prima donnas . The " Garden of Gethsemane , " he added , off to one side of the Cathedral , will have organ music piped to it , and the water fountain there will be so rigged electronically that it will react to the tone and volume of the music inside . The cathedral itself will be nondenominational , but the baptistery , noted Hargis , will be a waterfall . One Crusader , listening to Hargis ' description of the building , suggested jokingly that the cathedral have an execution chamber ?  | " in case we lose the fight . " All the other Crusaders present nodded in agreement . Hargis is an upstart on the scene compared to Dr. Carl McIntire , who has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastor of the Bible Presbyterian Church in Collingswood , New Jersey . He is editor-in-chief of the weekly Christian Beacon and the commentator on the 20th Century Reformation Hour radio broadcasts . He is also the founder of the American Council of Christian Churches , the president of the International Council of Christian Churches , president of Shelton College in Cape May , New Jersey , president of Faith Theological Seminary outside Philadelphia , and a director of Highland College in Pasadena , California . McIntire was born in 1906 and was graduated from Park College in Parkville , Missouri , in 1927 . He then entered Princeton Theological Seminary in preparation for the Presbyterian ministry . While there , he became an ardent admirer of Dr. J. Gresham Machen 's , a well-known Fundamentalist scholar . When Machen broke with the seminary in 1929 to set up his own more conservatively oriented Westminster Seminary in Chestnut Hill , Pennsylvania , McIntire followed and secured his degree from the new institution two years later . McIntire then began to work in opposition to the more liberal forces in his church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Missions that soon became so disruptive that the General Assembly of the Church voted to abolish it . This action , however , failed to cool McIntire 's ardor , and in 1936 he was dismissed from the ministry of the United Presbyterian Church . The synod found him guilty on three charges : disapproval , defiance and acts in contravention of his church 's government and discipline ; lack of zealousness and faith in maintaining the peace of the church ; and violation of his ordination vows . McIntire and Machen went on to found another church , but the two men eventually split . McIntire then founded on his own the Bible Presbyterian Church in Collingswood . A few years later , in  | 1941 , he formed the ACCC to compete with the National Council of Churches ( then called the Federal Council of Churches ) , which McIntire has always believed to be the fount of Protestant apostasy . In 1948 he set up the ICCC to compete with the World Council of Churches , then in the process of being organized in Amsterdam . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a matter of speculation . Neither McIntire nor the Council publishes a figure , one of the few groups listed in the Year Book of American Churches ( an NCC publication ) that refuses to do so . Since the NCC , the major body speaking for American Protestantism , lists forty-one million members in its thirty-one constituent denominations ( in 1965 ) , a number of interested observers have sought in vain to compare this figure with McIntire 's in order to assess relative strengths . The ACCC once stated that its membership was 1.25 million ; the National Association of Evangelicals , an independent group with 10 million members , offered to send $1,000 to any charity if McIntire could prove to independent auditors that the figure was even 20 percent correct . The challenge was not accepted . From all available sources , there are fifteen member churches under McIntire 's wing with a maximum total membership of 200,000 . The objectives of all McIntire 's groups are to return to what they believe to be fundamental Christian beliefs and to purge Protestantism of all its " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the list are Communists , socialists , liberals and " oneworlders , " followed closely by the NCC , the NAE , Catholics , the Gideons , the RSV Bible ( McIntire applauded its burning in a North Carolina church ) , the U.N. , Billy Graham ( " a compromiser " ) , the International Court of Justice , ecumenicalism and " the social gospel . " McIntire , as the undisputed leader of these 200,000 churchgoers , is the ACCC 's spokesman , and more often than not personally launches the attacks upon its enemies . He charges , for instance , that the U.N . is bankrupt morally and physically ; but regardless , he stresses that a " one-world church " is just around the corner . He opposes the U.S. 's " give-away " policies , disarmament , consumers ' cooperatives ( " little outposts of Soviet Russia " ) , the United Protestant appeal , " One Hour of Sharing " ( its purpose , said McIntire ,  | was to raise money for " Socialist propaganda " ) , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common man , " he explained , " is an innocentsounding term , but it is filled with all the tyranny of State control . " The word " brotherhood " is likewise to be distrusted , particularly " racial brotherhood , " because its emphasis " produces the class and racial strife in which the Communists delight . " His view of nuclear war is provocative : " For us to have the Atomic bombs , " he said , " and , in the name of a false morality born of a perverted sense of self-respect and pacifist propaganda , to await the hour when Russia has her bombs to precipitate an Atomic war , is the height of insanity . . . . " In the 1960 Presidential elections the Democratic Party listed McIntire as one of five " major anti-Catholic extremists operating in the current political campaign . " His antipathy toward Catholics is nothing new . In 1945 , he called the church " the Harlot Church and the Bride of the Anti-Christ . " It is , he added , the " greatest enemy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . . . . One would be much better off in a communistic society than in a Roman Catholic Fascist set-up . " 4 He has also described the Catholic Church as " a false religion which enslaves human souls in darkness and superstition , " which will " sell her secret confessional system for political world power . " All priests , he adds , whether they be in America or behind the Iron Curtain , are spies for the Pope . McIntire does not believe that he is anti-Catholic , but he does take great pride in his belief that it was he who kept President Truman from sending an ambassador to the Vatican . As for President Kennedy , his office , wrote McIntire , " was used to advance the Roman Catholic Church in the United States as it has never been advanced in all the years of its existence . " McIntire went on to say that " Americans respect the religion of others about them , but the manner in which the Roman Catholic Church exploited the President and the way in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced a deep resentment in the hearts of millions of Americans . It is still there today . " But undoubtedly the galling factor to McIntire was that , after Kennedy was elected , " the President treated the American  | Council of Christian Churches with the utmost disdain " by not treating it as an equal to the NCC ( which is over two hundred times larger than McIntire 's group ) .5 McIntire 's primary target is the National Council of Churches . Of all the groups he hates , he hates the NCC the most . To him , the Council is " apostate , Communist and modernist . " When the NCC replied that there had never been a Communist or a sympathizer among its officers , executives and staff , McIntire retorted that such a statement was " self-serving " and " preposterous . " The NCC asked that its detractors offer proof of the charges . Here McIntire backed off , saying , " It is puerile , naive , downright ignorant for the National Council of Churches to say that among all its numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with communist leanings . ' " McIntire sheds very little light on who exactly are the clerical Communists because , at the moment of truth , he refuses to name names . He retreats to the position that any association with a " communist front " warrants the man being a suspected Red . " How many communist fronts is it necessary for a man to be connected with , " he asks , " before someone can say that he gave aid and comfort to the communists and their cause ? " McIntire will call the NCC " communist , " but with individuals he beats around the bush , lest he be sued for libel or slander . He gives no indication that he believes it is his job to prove the charges . The examination of the " pro-Communist records " of two favorite McIntire targets ? Bishop Eugene Carson Blake and Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam ? should be sufficient to illustrate McIntire 's method of attack . McIntire 's source material usually comes from Myers Lowman 's Circuit Riders , Inc . Presbyterian Blake , for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Council of Churches , is condemned by Lowman because he signed a petition in 1959 to eliminate the HCUA . In the same vein , McIntire condemns Blake because three years previously he had shepherded Metropolitan Nicolai , " the KGB agent , " around the country under the auspices of the NCC . The mere fact that the two men would even talk to each other , in McIntire 's eyes , implies that they agree with each other , both spiritually and politically , that Blake was in cahoots with the visitor . By this reasoning , Eisen-  | hower is a Communist for inviting Khrushchev to the United States . Bishop Oxnam , a leading Methodist who has served the NCC for many years , is also a suspect because he has forty-one " citations " after his name in one of Lowman 's catalogues on the " public records " of Protestant Clergymen.6 A close inspection of these citations shows that most of them date from 1940-1946 , years when the Soviet Union was our ally . Seven of the organizations listed have made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my information , none of them were so listed when Oxnam was associated with them . Nor is there any indication that at least one of them ? the National Council of AmericanSoviet Friendship ( today listed as subversive ) ? was , during the war , endorsed by such luminaries as Cordell Hull , Leverett Saltonstall and General Eisenhower . Oxnam is further suspect , it appears , because he joined committees to abolish such Americana as the poll tax , lynching , HCUA and the H-bomb . McIntire minces no words when it comes to what he thinks of Bishop Oxnam . Wrote McIntire : " Oxnam represents the popular , radical , pro-communistic element in religious circles in America . . . . In the name of Christ , Oxnam has championed the socialist principles of Karl Marx and become , I believe , the leading religious disciple ' of Marx in the free world . " But such men as Bishops Blake and Oxnam are not the real target . The NCC is the target , and yet , only insofar as it represents everything that McIntire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birth or the bodily resurrection of Christ , or arc a believer in Darwin 's thories , or promote the brotherhood of man , or suggest that " God is dead , " or encourage ecumenicalism , or read the RSV Bible , or do and think any number of other " modernist " things , then according to McIntire , you are to be opposed and eventually destroyed by the forces of righteousness . The Supreme Court 's decision to ban prayer from the schools is particularly disliked by McIntire . " We are to be a Godless nation , " he said , " for anything which partakes of God , appeals to God , is religious ' and in violation of the First Amendment . " He predicts the day when Bibles will be banned from court and envisions future coins with the motto " In Pluralism We Trust . "  | McIntire is another one of those on the right who views democracy , capitalism and Christianity as indivisible from one another . For instance , he wrote : God is the Author of Liberty and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom , to state the moral foundations for a free society . This involves a Philosophy , a doctrine . The trouble with the National Council of Churches is that their philosophy is socialistic , basically materialistic . The church should not remain silent and have nothing to say . It should be the great champion of freedom and the exponent of the revealed will of ( loci. . . . and the second table of the Decalogue is exceedingly social in its demands and concepts of man and his relationship one to another . The churches should speak against communism , socialism and alien ideologues which deny freedom . Freedom is indivisible and its greatest champion in all areas should be blessed disciples of the Lord Jesus Christi ' Edward Cain , in his book They 'd Rather be Right ( Macmillan , 1963 ) , points out that somehow theological argument over the primacy of faith is lost in an argument over economics . The law of supply and demand , he adds , suddenly becomes one of God 's laws . Not only does freedom demand capitalism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , to his way of thinking , Christianity depends on capitalism . Edward Cain gingerly notes that this point of view raises the question of idolatry ? a far greater sin than apostasy and a heresy that does not seem to bother Mclntire.9 Mclntire 's views are spread among the public through a number of channels . He reaches the minds of the young clerics through his Faith Theological Seminary ; he reaches the young college student through Shelton College ( which is having problems with its accreditation ) and Highland College ; and he reaches selected minds through conferences held at the 333-room oceanside Christian Admiral Hotel in Cape May , New Jersey . This hotel was bought by one of McIntire 's organizations for $300,000 and refurbished with another $250,000 . Many of the rooms have been redecorated  | with special contributions and have been given such names as the Patrick Henry Room , the General MacArthur Room and the John Birch Room . But these activities are really sidelights to his main propaganda guns : letter writing and his 20th Century Reformation Hour radio shows . McIntire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the same pattern as Hargis ' . They come thick and fast , one every few weeks or so , each one with a return envelope enclosed for donations . Folksiness is combined with the hard sell . The letters often have such words as " Urgent " written at the top , and the faithful are addressed as " My dear Christian friend " or " Beloved . " Unlike Hargis , who is often content to ask for the $5 and $10 contributions , McIntire aims high . Apparently there is no limit to the possibilities . On one occasion he appealed for one individual to give $10 million for Shelton College ; on another occasion he ended his letter with : " I pray that this letter will bring the greatest single response that we have ever had from our radio audience . We need it today . Remember your will , the $1,000 gifts , too . We love God ! . . . " This same letter began as follows : " Hate ! Hate ! ! Hate ! ! ! ? we have uncovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . You will be amazed when I tell you the story . " McIntire went on to explain how station WXUR ( owned by Faith Theological Seminary ) in Media , Pennsylvania , had been subjected to a boycott and general harassment by its detractors and how he had overcome both . The 20th Century Reformation Hour was started in 1960 and has grown from a few stations to some six hundred outlets today all over the country . It costs an estimated $1.2 million per year for air time ( and another $500,000 to keep the rest of his operations afloat ) . McIntire keeps a large pin-studded map on the wall of his office in Collingswood , New Jersey , indicating where he has radio outlets . States with the most pins are Florida , Mississippi , North Carolina , Oklahoma , Pennsylvania , Texas , Virginia and Washington . There are very few pins along the upper Eastern seaboard and none in any of the major cities in the country . His audience is a rural and suburban one and is estimated at 20 million listeners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a folksy greeting  | that is offset by strains of some patriotic music such as " The Battle Hymn of the Republic . " His assistant , the Reverend Charles E. Richter ? known as " Amen Charlie " ? is also on the show ; his only job is to say " Amen , " " Yes , " " No " or other words at the appropriate moment during McIntire 's talk . Approximately one third of the program is religious in content , the message being tied in some way to the political two thirds . There is usually a long , extemporaneous prayer in the Fundamentalist tradition ; then perhaps a hymn followed by a short talk on some passage from the Bible ; and then a call for contributions for Korean orphans or Indian famine relief . Then comes the political pitch . The 8 December 1965 program , one of the few that I recorded , is typical . McIntire attacks the NCC for issuing a statement on its views on Vietnam . The NCC , notes McIntire , sees no victory possible and asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move by both sides for peace . The following extract reveals McIntire 's views : . . . If we were n't in there Vietnam right now , resisting the communists , they would already have all of South Vietnam and they 'd he well on their way to taking over Southeast Asia . As much as we hate war , as much as we want to keep away from it if we possibly can , when the aggressors come and they move in as the communists are moving , then we must stand up by the help of Almighty God and resist it and that 's exactly what we 're doing at the present time " Amen ! " and so far as war settling anything I 'd like to say to everybody everywhere it is the atomic arsenal and the military might of the United States which is keeping the peace of the world right now " Right ! " and that 's what 's doing it " A-men ! " . And furthermore let 's go a little further . The National Council says that war in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good evidence that the National Council leaders do n't believe the Bible in these matters . My Bible teaches very plainly that this old world is n't going to be destroyed until after Jesus Christ comes and then it 's gon na be destroyed by fire in judgement by Almighty God . . . . And I do n't believe for one moment that we 're gon na see the atomic blast destroy this world while you and I are here . It 's just not going to happen . But these communists and these liberals are using the fear of the bomb to  | frighten us so we wo n't stand up for our principles of morality and we will retreat from freedom . . . and our political leaders ? some of them ? are being intimidated by this type of propaganda . . . . We do n't want the peace of communism ; we do n't want the peace of slavery ; we do n't want the peace of tyranny . We want the peace of freedom ! " A-men ! " The program ends with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Dr. McIntire can be heard twice a day six times a week over this station and that all the programs are sponsored by McIntire 's newspaper , The Christian Beacon . Recently , McIntire 's radio programs have come under fire for presenting a distorted picture of the world . The " home " station of WXUR , for instance , has been accused of " blatant anti-Semitism " by the ADL . Other complaints have been lodged by the Catholic Interracial Council of New York , the American Baptist Convention , the United Church of Christ , the AFL-CIO , the National Urban League and the NAACP . The issue came to a head when WXUR applied to the FCC to have its license reissued when Faith Theological Seminary took over the operation of the station . To the annoyance of McIntire 's critics the license was granted . Soon afterward , the Pennsylvania State House of Representatives in the 1965 session passed Resolution 160 calling into question the fairness of the radio presentations and asking that the FCC initiate an investigation . This infuriated McIntire and he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rally support to his side and to rescind the resolution . I went to one of these rallies and it was much like his radio shows , but this time curiously with more of a religious slant . It was held on a farm in rural Pennsylvania , and some three hundred people turned up carrying their own aluminum-and-plastic folding chairs . They were middle-class Americans , neatly dressed and serious ; many carried Bibles . A buckboard stage had been set up , and some gospel singers entertained the crowd before the speeches . A few songs were sung , a long prayer was offered , there were a few short talks , and then eventually everyone settled back to hear the featured speaker , Carl McIntire.  | He is a large man with a firm handshake who leans protectively over a person when in conversation . His speaking voice is strong ; it echoed up and down the valley . His style of speaking is emotional : he waves his arms , his voice quavers , then whispers , then rises to a crescendo only to drop off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved " : " Oh , beloved , " he said , " my Bible says . . . that you ca n't serve Baal and serve God at the same time . . . . You ca n't talk about freedom without attacking communism and you ca n't talk about following God without attacking believing in a socialist state . . . . " The crowd nodded its approval . McIntire went on to discuss the injustice of Resolution 160 and asked everyone there to support him in his fight . As the hours passed and the sun began to disappear over the horizon , McIntire turned the rally into a revival . How this was to help in his tight against Resolution 160 is unclear ; it may have been the mood of the moment . With heads bowed , the audience was asked to make a decision for Christ . McIntire alternatively scolded , cajoled , pleaded , teased and begged the group , asking for those who felt they had God in their hearts to stand up . The crowd was silent . Again McIntire begged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger at his enemies , softened at the mention of God and the Scriptures . First one person stood up ; McIntire cried for joy . Then two more stood up , then another and another , until by the end of the evening the exhausted but happy crowd had seen six people stand up for Jesus . It was , in McIntire 's words , " a very successful rally . " Dr. Frederick Charles Schwarz of the Christian Anti-Communism Crusade claims that it is dishonest to include him and his organization in any political study . In the main , there is considerable justification for such a point of view because his Crusade does differ markedly from all other groups . He will say that he is neither right-wing , nor conservative , nor a Fundamentalist . The only two adjectives he will acknowledge are " Christian " and " antiCommunist . " Any cursory examination of the organization will show the  | following differences : he has no regular radio show ; he has not built any monuments to himself such as cathedrals or seminaries ; his letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money ; his speeches and writings display a modicum of good sense and intelligence ; he is the most open about his finances ( usually producing the latest balance sheet the instant the subject is mentioned ) ; and his activities for the most part are limited to discussing communism and the enemies of Christianity and freedom . In spite of this , however , there is a thread of politics running through his organization and his activities ; it can not be avoided . Schwarz 's detractors are many and vocal . He has been called a " patriot for profit " ; the " ' Enry ' Iggins of the Right " ; a namedropper who never smiles , who is rude , " wary " and " dumpy , " and who rages at his staff in a shrill , Cockney-flavored voice . All this is unfair and detracts from understanding the man and his Crusade . Schwarz was born in Brisbane , Queensland , Australia , in 1913 , the son of a well-to-do Viennese Jew who had embraced Christianity . He won degrees in science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of years thereafter was a general practitioner and psychiatrist in the suburbs of Sydney . He was also a lay preacher in the local Baptist church . Schwarz first became interested in the anti-Communist cause in 1940 when he took on a well-known Australian Communist in debate and was soundly trounced . His pride was hurt by his own lack of knowledge , so he began to read all the books he could find on communism ? those of Marx , Engels , Lenin and Stalin for a start . In time his knowledge was such that he was asked by many groups to lecture on the subject . He eventually took his revenge on the Communists when , one day , he found himself speaking in the Sydney Domain , the Australian version of Speakers ' Corner . A Communist fired a question at him : " What is dialectical materialism ? " he asked . Schwarz shot back : " Dialectical materialism is the philosophy of Karl Marx that is formulated by taking the dialectic of Hegel , marrying it to the materialism of Feuerbach , abstracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict of contradictory , interacting forces called the Thesis and the Antithesis culminating at a critical nodal point where one overthrows the  | other , giving rise to the Synthesis , applying it to the history of social development , - and deriving therefrom an essentially revolutionary concept of social change . " The questioner 's jaw dropped , and he looked at Schwarz with wide-open eyes . " Do n't blame me , " said Schwarz . " It is your philosophy , not mine . You are the one who believes it . " 10 By 1950 Schwarz was well known in Australian anti-Communist circles . He came to the attention of Dr. Carl McIntire and Dr. T. T. Shields , the latter a Baptist minister from Toronto , both of whom were visiting Australia that year . They persuaded Schwarz to make a two-month tour of the United States , which he subsequently did . In 1953 Schwarz returned to America and set up the tax-free Christian Anti-Communism Crusade in Waterloo , Iowa , in partnership with W. E. Pietsch , a local radio evangelist . The purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lectures in schools , colleges , civic clubs , servicemen 's organizations and other similar organizations and through radio and television broadcasts and by providing courses for missionaries and others to he used in Bible schools and seminaries and the holding of religious and evangelistic services in churches , and through the publication of books , pamphlets and literature . . . . " In 1956 , the Crusade moved to San Pedro , California , and two years later five miles away to Long Beach where it is situated today . It maintains regional offices in Waterloo , Houston , Seattle , San Francisco , Indianapolis and Sydney , Australia . Schwarz received two assists that helped to make his name known nationally . Billy Graham arranged a meeting with congressmen whom Schwarz addressed in Washington . Shortly thereafter , in 1957 , Schwarz was asked to testify before the HCUA . His topic was " International Communism ( the Communist Mind ) . " It was this testimony before the HCUA that perhaps catapulted Schwarz into the role as an " expert " on communism , a reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ects his views on communism . He sees the Communists as having grown from a handful of men half a century ago to a vast and powerful dictatorship controlling nearly one third of the world . Christianity , he has said , after two thousand years can do no better . In his view , Communists are incredibly intelligent , capable , resourceful , clever , well-organized ,  | sinister and quite mad . He believes , for instance , that they have been successful in the past because of the belief in and the application of three " scientific laws . " The first is , he says , " There is no God . ' They are proudly , unashamedly atheistic in theory and practice . When they deny God , they simultaneously deny every virtue and every value that originates with God . They deny moral law . They deny absolute standards of truth and righteousness . An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwarz , " is that man is a material machine . He is matter in motion and nothing more . Man is a body , and he is completely describable in terms of the laws of chemistry and physics . Man has no soul , no spirit , no significant individual value , no continuity of life . He is entirely an evolutionary product , the species Homo sapiens , and subject to modification , adaptation and transformation by the applied , established laws of animal husbandry . " The final " law " is economic determinism . " It states , " Schwarz told the Committee , " that the qualities of human intelligence , personality , emotional and religious life merely reflect the economic environment ; that in the last analysis what we think , what we feel , what we believe , whom we love , and whom we worship is simply an expression of the environment in which we are raised , and since that environment is primarily concerned with economic forces , in the final analysis , man is a determined economic being . " Schwarz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a class concept , that its followers believe that capitalism creates a degenerate environment , that they believe in the universality of class war and that the ends justify the means . ' ' Brooks R. Walker , the author of The Christian Fright Peddlers ( a book , incidentally , that Schwarz believes treated him fairly ) , criticizes Schwarz 's view of communism . He writes that Schwarz reduces communist philosophy to the point where it appears absurd . He adds that Schwarz overplays the Communist 's commitment to scientific empiricism . Walker then notes that he equates atheism with the repudiation of ethics and morality , which , if true , would impugn the name of many moral and ethical atheists.  | Schwarz does these atheists a further dishonor by linking all atheism with communism . Walker does say , however , that Schwarz has grasped the essence of one communist appeal : the program to change human nature . Schwarz described the ideal communist environment : " There will be no need for a police force ; there will be nothing for police to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone working , according to his natural impulses , gives of his best for the general well-being , and out of the abundance thus created retains only his own personal needs . Farewell anger , lust and greed , envy , malice and strife , pestilence and war ; enter golden , compassionable , cooperative brotherhood ; mankind will live together in the glorious day of communism that has dawned on earth . " Behind all this , notes Walker , " is the certain knowledge that one man must he sacrificed , and he is the most important of all ? the individual . Human nature has been redefined by someone , some group , other than the only person who has a right to say what human nature should be ? the individual . The nature of man has been placed in the keeping of an elite , now called the Presidium , which is entrusted with deciding what is best for man . " ' 2 One reason I put Schwarz among the Christian right groups is that he , too , equates freedom , capitalism , free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , can exist without the other . American freedom , he writes , rests on an economic base . Walker points out that Schwarz falls into the same trap Marx did : he has reduced the complexities of history to a single-cause theory of economics . Schwarz 's viewpoint , furthermore , tends to polarize the world into two camps , good and evil . There are no gray areas , just black and white , take your choice . This is a common view among all minor political groups . Schwarz is also criticized for putting too much emphasis on the vulnerability of the student to communist ideas . He talks of the " student intellectual who is susceptible to the appeals of communism by reason of his educational conditioning " who " sees the opportunity to mold men and create history . " To many people , this is a fatuous argument . The greatest criticism , however , is directed toward Schwarz 's  | constant use of scare phrases . He once said to an audience ? perhaps his best-known remark : " Christians ! To arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armor of the Christian and go forth to the battle ! When they come for you , as they have for many others , and on a dark night , in a dank cellar , they take a wide-bore revolver with a soft-nose bullet , and they place it at the nape of your neck . . . . " 13 On another occasion he told an audience that Khrushchev himself had " chosen San Francisco as headquarters of the world communist dictatorship ? the Mark Hopkins Hotel will make splendid offices for him . " Again he has said : " If you own shares of common stock , it means you ! Now , fifteen million Americans own common stock ! If the Reds win , it means the gallows ! " Another of his famous scare phrases was the remark he made to the HCUA where he said that the Communists had tentatively set the deadline for the conquest of America at 1973 . Critics point out that if this were indeed true , this is no time to sit around and talk about it as Schwarz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I asked to be judged , " he told me , " not on whether I frighten people but on whether I give a true picture of the nature of communism , the magnitude of the communist danger and the consequences of communist conquest . " He added : " I think fear is a stimulus ; it makes the adrenalin flow . " In reply to those critics who say he paralyzes people with his phraseology , he said emphatically : " I think they 're wrong ! " But Schwarz does not eschew emotionalism . " Yes , my logic makes others emotional , " he said , " but I 'm not emotional . Emotion is part of humanity . If someone tells you a member of your family has been hurt and you do n't get emotional , you 're either in a state of shock ? which is protective ? or abnormal . Now I can tell about that person being hurt in a calm , quiet voice . . . , " he said . Schwarz is criticized also because he comes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it that way . His job , he explained , is to educate , not to provide the answers . " In medical terms , " he said , " I am a pathologist . He is the one who analyzes , describes and researches the disease . He never cured anyone in his life ; he simply provides the physician with informa-  | tion . " Yet , in a sense , Schwarz believes that by analyzing communism and by explaining it to the public , he is , in effect , partially providing the cure , because he is convinced that an informed public is the best defense against communism . He is particularly irritated by many of his critics . He calls them totalitarian in nature because they apparently believe that the ordinary people are not fit to hear the truth except from some approved elite . This , he says , is ridiculous . " You can learn more in a half hour in a library , " he told me , " than you can from years of reading newspapers . " The 1962 TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by CBS , particularly rankles him . He considers it the " most effective forgery by film ' I have ever seen . " Nowhere , he wrote to the producer , " was there any intelligent presentation of the message which consumes the great majority of the time at the anti-conununismI schools . This I consider basic dishonesty . " Schwarz wrote to the president of CBS asking if his Crusade could buy a 16 mm film presentation of the film . " I would like to use it , " he wrote , " at our anti-communism schools to illustrate great technical proficiency in the service of dishonesty . " Schwarz received no reply . Personally , Schwarz is a pleasant and informal middle-aged man . He wears short-sleeved shirts around the office and will put his feet on his desk when in conversation . He is equally as informal with his staff , his favorite phrase being " Righto ! " His Australian twang seems at first to be nearer a Down East accent . He is , however , high-strung and full of nervous energy . Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked he will break in and say , " Just a minute . . . just a minute . . . just a minute . . . " in an attempt to have it rephrased . His Crusade 's headquarters are located in downtown Long Beach in what was at one time a bank building . Empty tellers ' cages stand to the left as one enters . Along one wall to the rear of the building were 50,000 copies of Schwarz 's book , You Can Trust the Communists ( to be Communists ) which were destined , so Schwarz said , for Louisiana schools . The book 's title had been changed to Communism ? the Deceitful Tyranny , lest the young minds misinterpret the original title . Schwarz claimed that over  | one million copies of the book had been sold since it was first published in 1960 . Schwarz spreads his message to the American people through " Schools of Anti-Communism , " a week-long series of lectures that run from nine in the morning until nine-thirty at night . It costs ten dollars to attend all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end . Featured speakers over the years have included ex-Communist Helen Birnie ; F. Gano Chance ; Major General William F. Dean ; Senator Thomas J. Dodd ; E. Merrill Root , the author of Brain-Washing in the High Schools and Collectivism on the Campus ; J. Fred Schlafly , Jr. , president of Defenders of American Liberty ( a sort of right-wing ACLU ) ; W. Cleon Skousen ; and Commander Paul Terry , director of education for the Copley Press newspaper chain . A typical school was the Greater Chicago School of AntiCommunism , held in late May 1965 . Schwarz spoke eight times , on such subjects as " Communist Philosophy , " " Communist Fronts " and " How to Debate Communists and Fellow Travellers . " Charles Fox , editor of the California-based muckraking magazine , Tocsin , spoke on " Communism on the Campus . " Herbert A. Philbrick spoke on " I Led Three Lives " ( also the name of his book ) and the " Assassination of President Kennedy . " M. Stanton Evans spoke on " The Investigating Committees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs the Crusade 's Northern California branch , spoke on " British Guiana : A Case History . " There were also numerous films : " Nightmare in Red , " " Communist Weapon of Allure , " " Schwarz-Harry Bridges Debate " and the old favorite , " Operation Abolition , " were but a few shown to the audience . And there was Janet Greene , the Crusade 's director of music , whose guitar-playing was supposed to " demonstrate the value of folk-singing in exposing the doctrine and practices of communism . " Some of the songs she sings are entitled : " Termites and Comrade 's Lament , " " Inch by Inch , " " Fascist Threats , " and " Commie Lies . " Schwarz confessed to me that he wrote the words to some of the songs . The most famous of all the schools held by Schwarz and his Crusade was actually not a school at all but a rally held in October 1961 , in the Hollywood Bowl before 15,000 cheering Crusaders .  | On the stage were such luminaries as George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lloyd Nolan , Robert Stack , Roy Rogers , Edgar Bergen , Andy Devine , Walter Brennan , Cesar Romero , Tex Ritter , Ozzie and Harriet Nelson , Jack L. Warner and William Lundigan . But the star of the show was C. D. Jackson , Life magazine 's publisher . Previously , Life had called the Crusade " a new kind of revival meeting , ' serving non-religious ends . . . . " Schwarz preaches , the article went on , " doomsday by communism in 1973 unless every American starts distrusting his neighbor as a possible Communist or Comsymp . ' " The editors of Life apparently reconsidered their position , and as a result Jackson journeyed West to make amends . He apologized ? and ended by aligning Life with Schwarz in the fight against communism . Two weeks later , Life , in an editorial , reaffirmed its hostility to the radical right but reserved more praise for Schwarz as " well informed , " adding , even if the Crusade did attract those people who were " too superheated to teach or learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people points up one of Schwarz 's problems : the quality and stability of his followers . In many cases these people belong to the more volatile right-wing groups , those organizations sometimes known as " meet and scream " groups , who are ready to condemn , attack , harass or intimidate at the first slip of a liberal phrase . Schwarz admits he is embarrassed by them at times but says that it is the price one pays for educating a far larger group . In one instance , Schwarz parodied the more extreme individuals by saying that they were the type who referred to the Kennedy Administration as " that nest of traitors up there in Washington who are selling us down the river . " To his discomfort , the audience broke out into vigorous applause , not at the parody but at the remark . " You know , " he said , " they actually misunderstood what I was saying ; they thought I meant lt. " 14 Schwarz is open to considerable criticism because all follow-up work after an Anti-Communism School session is left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined . Schwarz maintains no machinery to ensure that what he has taught to a certain group is being spread throughout the area after he has left . In many cases the void is filled by members of the John Birch Society who are  | zealous organizers and are quick to grab anyone who has become agitated by Schwarz 's remarks . The Crusade is a half-a-million-dollar operation . The bulk of its income comes from membership dues , private contributions , special meetings and schools . Half of its expenses go to advertising its meetings and administrative expenses . Other major outlays include salaries and " foreign missionary " work . Schwarz is paid $5,000 per year and his wife draws another $5,400 . The Crusade 's 1965 foreign investment included gifts to various enterprises in South America ( over $25,000 ) , Japan ( $7,000 ) , and for " television programs " ? exactly where is not stated ( $30,000 ) . Past investments , in this case in 1962 , include financing a printing press in Kerala , India ; the purchasing of a property for orphan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Japan ; the publication in Spanish of You Can Trust the Communists for distribution in Mexico ; and various other smaller programs in South Africa , British Guiana and Jamaica . Schwarz received considerable publicity in 1963 when some of his zealous followers began distributing a twelve-page comic book below the border entitled If Communism Comes to Mexico . This booklet shows Communists standing over laborers with whips , other peasants languishing in prison , and a priest being driven through the streets at the point of a bayonet . The booklet concludes that , if the Communists take over , most Mexicans will lose their lives . There follow some Bible verses and a plea to all patriots to defend their homeland . Schwarz 's backers are a wealthy lot . Patrick Frawley has long been a generous donor . His Technicolor , Inc. , and Schick Safety Razor Company sponsored the Hollywood Bowl rally in 1961 . Frawley is quoted as saying : " Dr. Schwarz will not lack for money while I 'm around . " Another big contributor is the Richfield Oil Company , also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributor ; so is the Lilly Endowment and the Glenmede Trust of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . One of the questions that Schwarz has to parry time and time again is : " Why is it necessary for an Australian to come to  | America to tell us how we can be saved from communism ? " Schwarz answers by saying : " How dare Sister Kenny come to the United States to try and stop children from having poliomyelitis ! " He went on to say that " if there were eight Soviet subs off Australian cities , there is nothing the Australian Prime Minister could do except scream to the United States and plead for help . If it does n't come , you 're sunk . " Freedom , he said , " will live or die on what the United States does , so that is why I am here . Americans have always welcomed ideas from other people . They have been wonderfully generous to me . " A word should be said on another Christian right group . Its name is the Church League of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was founded in 1937 by three prominent Chicago businessmen who were decidedly anti-New Deal . Roosevelt 's " court-packing " is cited by the League as the reason for the original organizational meeting . Once established , the League campaigned against a third term for FDR in 1940 and against federal aid to education . According to its literature , the purpose of the League is to " rekindle the spirit of valiant Christian Americanism . " It complains that " Marxian Socialism is a growing force in this nation " and that this " organized Radicalism must be met intelligently and courageously . " The American form of government , it notes , " is distinctly a limited government deriving its powers from the governed and it must always remain so . . . . An all powerful government tends to become arrogant , imperious , extravagant and Fascistic . . . . Those who are affiliated with the Church League of America in action or in sympathy recognize that intellectual and spiritual freedom are inseparable from the freedom to accumulate and own and that free enterprise is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. ) can satisfactorily survive . . . . " The activities of the League fall into three categories : " research , " publishing , and local activities such as lectures and seminars . The League claims to have " over five tons " of " counter-  | subversive " files with one million three-by-five cross-reference index cards , all of which is supposed to have been accumulated since the turn of the century . These files contain information on " Communists and fellow-travelers , " many of whom are supposed to be members of the clergy . The League is also supposed to have a complete library on leftist literature from the Worker to New Masses to People 's World . There are also files on the ACLU and the ADA and a section set off by itself on John Dewey . Very few outsiders have seen these files . For anyone contributing ten dollars or more per year to the League , " documental information " from the research section may be secured . Unlimited information is not available for the tendollar contributor but is calculated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-dollar contribution ? after the initial information on four people is obtained . The League also publishes " special detailed documented reports on organizations , individuals , publications and movements " which are free to the ten-dollar contributor . In addition , the League publishes a monthly newssheet " of current subversive activity " called News and Views which goes to all those contributing five dollars or more . These files are housed in a contemporary colonial , $225,000 building in Wheaton , Illinois , a Chicago suburb . No outsider is allowed to inspect the files , nor is one even allowed to see the area in which they are housed . When I stopped by the office , I was politely rebuffed in my attempts to see them by Mrs. Edgar C. Bundy , the wife of the executive director ( who was away on business at the time ) . She most willingly sold me some of the League 's literature but would not let me stray past the lobby . As I was leaving , she called after me cheerfully : " Now you write something nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable amount of literature is available for anyone who wishes to buy it . Books include Certain Activities and Affiliations of 181 Lutheran Clergymen , by J. B. Matthews ; Collectivism in the Churches , by Major Edgar C. Bundy ; and I Was an NKVD Agent , by Anatole Granovski . The League 's latest catalogue ( 1966 ) lists fifty-six " valuable tape recordings for anti-Communist study groups or public meetings , " two of which are seminars featur-  | ing collections of six and fifteen tapes respectively . A one-hour tape rents for four dollars and sells for eight dollars . Some of the titles on the tapes are : " Communist Penetration of Religious Groups " ( one hour ) , " Enter the Anti-Christ " ( one hour ) , " Will the Communists Capture the U.S. ? " ( two hours ) and " Pornographic Literature in the Churches and Recommended by the National Council of Churches " ( one hour and a half ) . Most of the tapes are narrated by Major Bundy . Films are also for rent or sale . Twenty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ye Shall Know Them " is a favorite and is described as " a hard-hitting documentary exposing all of the Communist Party and front organization publications and their vicious attacks on Barry Goldwater , calling for his defeat and the election of Lyndon Johnson ; and a host of official publications of liberal church groups which are doing the same thing in the same language . . . . " ( The title of this film is also the unofficial motto of the Church League ; its members will say , for instance , that the files are not used for name-calling purposes but simply speak for themselves . ) Other films available are the sixty-minute " Katanga " ( " See the stark tragedy of how the so-called peaceful ' United Nations . . . savagely attacked the only anti-Communist province of the Congo . . . . " ) , the twenty-minute " It 's a Grand Old Flag , " the thirty-minute " Ronald Reagan on the Welfare State " and the old standby , the thirty-minute " Operation Abolition . " One of the major activities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by local groups throughout the country which must produce a minimum attendance of fifty individuals . The " tuition " is ten dollars and is tax-deductible and includes a year 's subscription to News and Views . The seminars last from two to four days and feature lectures by Major Bundy and others who are described as " the highest qualified men in the nation . " Each seminar is built around A Manual for Survival , a textbook compiled by the Church League . This book begins by outlining the dangers of communism , then it discusses communist techniques , such as infiltration and subversion , and concludes with a chapter on what the individual can do about it . On the Supreme Court the book said : " June 17 , 1957 , has  | come to be known as Red Monday by both lawyers and antiCommunists . . . . On that day Chief Justice Warren and Justices Frankfurter , Douglas , Black , Harlan , and Brennan handed down four decisions which in effect told the Communists Go ahead , boys , you have nothing to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are about 1,391,000 teachers of all classes from kindergarten to graduate level in the United States . Of this number , roughly 300,000 are college , university or seminary teachers , professors or administrators . Dr. J. B. Matthews , a recognized authority in this field , has compiled the front records of some 6,000 educators , practically all of them at college or university level . Of this number probably not over 2,000 could be said to have long , consistent , and significant communist front affiliations . Yet to paraphrase a famous observation of Winston Churchill , never have so few served to bring so much disgrace and suspicion on so many otherwise honorable and patriotic people . " To combat these tendencies , the book recommends that the patriot undertake certain activities . First : read the Christian Beacon , Dan Smoot Report , Human Events , National Review or News and Views . Then , " do not try to fight alone . Join and actively support reputable organizations which convince you that they are doing a good job in combatting subversion . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters to editors exposing the " leftist " letters . If no local group is available to join , then " locate a few experts with former FBI , Army , Navy or other intelligence experience and form a small study and action group " ; get anti-Communists to speak at the local clubs and luncheons ; and never allow anyone in your hearing " to slur the FBI , the House Committee on Un-American Activities , the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee , the Church League of America , the American Council of Christian Churches or any other organization which you know to be fighting subversion . " The man behind all this activity is Major Edgar C. Bundy , a graduate of Oglethorpe University in Atlanta and Wheaton College in Wheaton , Illinois . Bundy served in the Air Force from 1941 to 1948 , which included an assignment as an intelligence officer on  | General Claire Chennault 's 14th Air Force staff in China . During his service , Bundy was ordained a Baptist minister in the Southern Baptist Convention but has never held a pastorate . After he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves and otherwise earned his living as city editor of the Wheaton Daily Journal . Bundy first came to national attention in 1950 . The previous year he had testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee in opposition to the foreign aid bill . He advised that funds for Europe and NATO be diverted to the Pacific , specifically to China , because , he said , if China fell , then Japan , the Philippines , India , Burma , the Malay States and the Dutch East Indies would all fall to the Communists . And South Korea , he added , would be invaded by North Korea . When China did fall and South Korea was invaded , Bundy 's stock shot up significantly . He was hailed as a political clairvoyant . His correct predictions at that time are used today to strengthen the predictions he makes for tomorrow . Bundy was also active in the American Legion . In 1954 , he sponsored the Legion 's condemnation of the Girl Scout Handbook as " un-American . " The next year he led the Legion forces that secured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an investigation of the ACLU and various foundations . Bundy 's resolution asking the Legion to recommend America 's withdrawal from the U.N. , however , was defeated . Again , in 1961 , Bundy led the Legion attack on the Foreign Policy Association . The previous year he had jumped with both feet into the Air Force Manual Affair by vigorously defending the inclusion of the material that had originated in the literature of Billy James Hargis . This was also the year that Bundy visited General Walker in Germany . Walker had included Bundy 's book , Collectivism in the Churches , on his recommended reading list for the " Ladies Study Groups , " made up of 24th Infantry Division wives . This was a part of Walker 's " Pro-Blue " program that was to bring him under such fire and eventual retirement . Bundy took over the reins of the Church League in 1956 and since that year has built the organization up to where it now is considered the largest right-wing " research " ( in this sense , of people and organizations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a  | staff of twenty-three and receipts ( in 1964 ) of $208,000 . The latter figure represents nearly a tenfold increase since Bundy took charge . To be sure , many other organizations have similar files , but nobody has " over five tons " of them . Myers Lowman 's Circuit Riders , Inc. , maintains extensive files on church laymen ; so does Lloyd Wright 's American Security Council ; George Washington Robnett 's ( one of the original founders of the Church League ) Institute for Special Research is also said to have extensive files on Communists ; so does Myron C. Fagan 's Cinema Educational Guild , which concentrates on Reds in the movie industry ; the Cardinal Mindzenty Foundation keeps files on " slanted " or " antianti-Communist textbooks " ; Hargis ' Christian Crusade , mentioned previously , has extensive files ; and so does the Americanism Educational League from Los Angeles and the International Services of Information , Inc. , from Baltimore . Bundy 's public utterances are little different from those of Carl McIntire , who is a friend of his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the late Edward R. Murrow as " a smear artist against anti-Communist forces " ; Harry Overstreet as a " minor rank philosophy professor " ; and academic freedom as " the ultimate of insanity . " " . . . The fact was and is that COMMUNISM and THEOLOGICAL MODERNISM are as one ! " he wrote in News and Views . " Communism and Modernism , " he continued , " walk hand in hand . They are bedfellows . They complement one another . They come to each other 's rescue when they get in trouble . They have a mutual defense . They maintain a mutual offense against their common enemy ? Bible-believing Christians who want no part of their false doctrines . " Church Leaguers , along with the followers of Hargis , McIntire and Schwarz , would add a hearty " A-men ! " to that .  | The Educators The final category of right-wing groups is the educational-intellectual one , those groups who promote new ideas , remake old ones and reflect the views that are current on the right . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions : Freedom School and Rampart College , and Harding College and the National Education Program . Three are " idea " organizations : the Foundation for Economic Education , the American Economic Foundation , and the Intercollegiate Studies Institute . And two are publications : Human Events and National Review . Freedom School and Rampart College are two small , private , unaccredited institutions located on the same campus ? a 526-acre area outside the town of Larkspur , Colorado , a few miles north of Colorado Springs . The rustic-looking campus sits in a lovely valley of fir trees along the Rampart Range of the Rocky Mountains . The Freedom School was founded in 1956 " to conduct a school for students sixteen years old and over to teach primarily the libertarian philosophy of individualism . " The courses run for a twoweek period and cost from $60 ( " workshops for advanced students " ) to $350 ( for a course in " Explorations in Human Actions , " limited to executives ) . Faculty members are drawn from other organizations and institutions . They include Frank Chodorov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Intercollegiate Society of Individualists ; Rose Wilder Lane , a benefactress of the school ( one of the buildings is named for her ) and  | a former editor of Merwin K. Hart 's National Economic Council Review of Books ; Leonard Read , president and founder of the Foundation for Economic Education ; newspaper owner R. C. Hoiles ; and a clutch of economists from such institutions as the University of Wisconsin , Ohio Northern , Queens College ( Flushing , New York ) , University of Michigan and Utah State Agricultural College . In 1963 , " The Phrontistery " ( Greek for " a place for thinking " ) was added to the school 's facilities , complete with dean and visiting lecturers . Two of the better known of the latter in the past have been Milton Friedman , Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago , and Ludwig Von Mises , a visiting Professor of Economics at New York University and a consultant to FEE . The Phrontistery runs for only six months during the winter and is described as " an intensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's courses " seek to find the truth of man 's nature which can enhance man 's wellbeing . " The two weeks of instruction are broken down into six sections of study : " The Nature of Man , " " Acting Man , " " The Nature of the Market , " " The Human Record , " " The Nature of Government " and " The Nature of a Free Man . " The approach to these subjects will be discussed later in the chapter . The other institution , Rampart College , was founded in 1963 and is a four-year unaccredited school specializing " on the findings already available . . . through the Freedom School operation . " At the moment , Freedom School facilities are being used until the construction of the college 's graduate school is completed . When finished , the Rampart College complex , overlapping somewhat with the Freedom School plant , will have cost some five million dollars to build and endow . The purpose of the college is to educate students " in the art of thinking , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not through the parroting of opinions expressed by others . " Although unaccredited , courses at Rampart ? primarily history , business administration , economics and " praxeology " ( the study of human actions ) ? can lead to the awarding of a degree . Exactly what kind is not specified but college officials talk in terms of " master 's degrees " and " PhD's. "  | Together , Freedom School and Rampart College house a library of 11,000 books which they hope to enlarge to 100,000 when the Rampart expansion is completed . The current cornerstone of the library is the works of Mill , Locke and Spencer , and the complete works of the Foundation for Economic Education . Both schools generate a number of publications . One is called the Newsletter and is used to stimulate and maintain interest in the school among alumni , friends and contributors . Rampart has its own Journal ( " of individualist thought " ) , a well-bound quarterly featuring articles by such writers , past and present , as Lysander Spooner , Albert Szent-Gyorgyi and Herbert Spencer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two schools publish or distribute a number of works . There is Anarchy and This Bread Is Mine , both by the schools ' dean , Robert LeFevre ; there is The Anti-Capitalist Mentality , by Ludwig Von Mises ; Economics in One Lesson , by Henry Hazlitt ; and What Has Government Done to Our Money ? by Murray N. Rothbard . The Press has its own tabloid called Pine Tree , which is " for the politically disenchanted . " It cost ten dollars for a year 's subscription , and one of its " regular columnists " is George Boardman from Chloride , Arizona , who is also associated with Kent Courtney 's Conservative Society of America . In 1962 Freedom School ? then still the major operation ? reported a total income of $187,000 . The bulk of this money comes from private contributors . The largest in that year was the Deering Milliken Foundation , which gave $100,000 . In fact , one of the biggest boosters of the school is Roger Milliken , the antiunion textile mill owner from Spartanburg , South Carolina . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other large contributors in the past have been the Donner Foundation ( now called the Independence Foundation ) , the Winchester Foundation ( supported by Pierre F. Goodrich ) , and the Ingersoll , Grede , Chance and Barber-Colman Foundations . Many of the students , particularly those taking the executivecentered " Explorations in Human Action " course , come from the industrial companies that provide the funds for the above foundations . Thus Ingersoll Milling Machine , the Barber-Colman Company , Grede Foundries and the A. B. Chance Company all send  | their favored employees there . Deering Milliken , however , is the most enthusiastic company . In 1965 , for instance , it sent a total of 167 employees to the Freedom School . This represented 58 percent of all the students that attended the school 's courses that year . The man behind all this activity is Robert LeFevre ( he pronounces it " Luh Fave " ) , the founder and dean of both institutions . His background includes stints as radio disc jockey , sound effects engineer ( one Minneapolis news story in 1935 described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise or another 91 times during a 15-minute program " ) , real estate broker , army captain and newspaperman . He was also something of a cultist in his youth ( although his own biography does not reflect it ) , having been an ardent follower of " Daddy " and " Mama " Ballard , leaders of the Great I AM Movement . A slight digression is necessary here to explain this cult . The Great I AM Movement was founded in the early 1930s by Guy Ballard , an amateur theosophist , and his wife , Edna , an occultist and harpist . Their movement enjoyed some vogue between 1934 and 1940 and claimed several million followers ( a doubtful estimate ) at its peak . The movement took its name from Exodus 3:13 ? 14 where Moses , in conversation with the voice out of the burning bush , asked : " Who shall I say sent me ? " The answer was : " I am that I am . " If I understand it correctly , the basis for I AM , as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had on Mt . Shasta . There , he met " St. Germain , " who gave Ballard a cup full of liquid from the " Universal Supply ? Omnipotent Life itself . " This liquid enabled Ballard 's spirit to withdraw from his physical body . Then St. Germain took Ballard in his new state , wrapped in a sheet of flame , and traveled around the world , in one instance to visit Ballard 's past incarnations ? as a great musician in southern France and as an ancient Egyptian priest . The most important trip , however , was to Royal Teton Mountain where St. Germain kept the records of the entire world . A stone was touched , the rocks parted , huge bronze doors swung open and there , inside , were large rooms filled with gold and silver . In one room was a large golden disc with seven points to it , through which poured " the  | Great Cosmic Beings , " powerful currents of force received only by either the " Great Illumined " or the " Ascended Masters of Light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written on gold sheets . The " Mighty I AM presence " was the Ballards ' way of saying God but was never clearly expressed as such . " Ascendant Masters " were humans who , by their own effort , generated within themselves enough power and love to break away from human limitations . There were many such Masters : St. Germain , Jesus , God of the Swiss Alps , Angel Deva of the Jade Temple , Ray-OLight , Cassiopeia , Quan Yin and , after his death in 1939 , Guy Ballard himself . The sect condemned xylophones , accordions , cymbals , banjoes and saxophones as carrying " certain destructive vibratory action . " It also condemned bowling , fashion shows , going bare-legged ( except in a tennis game ) , shirt-tails hanging out and anklets for girls under fifteen . It praised the harp , skating and swimming ( except going in and out of the water , because the temperature change would " open the door to sex " ) . Politically , the movement was extremely conservative . Many I AM adherents were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A certain number of I AM members were known as the " one hundred percenters . " They swore to follow no other teachings and to abstain from all meat , onions , garlic , tobacco , liquor , narcotics , card playing and sexual intercourse . Human life is maintained , they believed , as long as the " Silver Cord of Liquid White Light " is anchored in the heart . This Light comes from the Mighty I AM presence and enters through the top of an individual 's head . The sect also believed in reincarnation . Guy Ballard believed he was the reincarnation of George Washington . His other reincarnations , he said , went back 70,000 years . His wife , Edna , was convinced she was the reincarnation of Joan of Arc and their only son , Donald , the reincarnation of the Marquis de Lafayette . Part of the sect 's ritual included " decrees " or " calls " whereby the power of the Mighty I AM presence was invoked to destroy the cult 's enemies . One decree , directed at President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blast , blast , blast their carcasses  | from the face of the earth forever ! " A more general one went as follows : " Send Legions of Thy Angel Devas of the Blue Lightning of Divine Love to seize , bind and remove from within and around me and my world all entities . . . forever ! If they be of human creation , annihilate them ! . . . " Ballard claims to have destroyed 400,000 such individuals in Philadelphia , 332,000 in New York City and one million in the rest of the United States within a single 23-hour period by just such invocations . ' I AM cultists also believed that whenever someone was reincarnated he always came back as someone worse than the previous person he was . Thus they thought that they were doing their enemies a favor by calling for their damnation before they got any worse . In any event , LeFevre was a follower of the Ballards from 1936 to 1940 or so . He and one Pearl Diehl wrote a 199-page book in 1940 of their experiences in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Twin City House , St. Paul , Minnesota ) . LeFevre related how one day , when he was filing records in a radio studio , he was struck by the Great I AM presence , who spoke to him personally . LeFevre also relates a number of supernatural experiences : driving a car while asleep for over twenty miles without an accident ( this was accomplished with the help of his " Higher Mental Body " ) , leaving his physical body for a trip through the air to Mt . Shasta , and seeing Jesus . In 1940 , Edna Ballard and her son Donald were indicted by a grand jury in Los Angeles for using the mails to defraud . Twentyfour other I AM leaders were also named in the first indictment ; a supplemental indictment named LeFevre and Diehl as additional defendants . But charges against these two and a dozen others were soon dismissed at the request of the government . The legal battles of the two Ballards is a long and complicated story involving a trial , a dismissal , a retrial , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through all this , maintained the leadership of the cult , although membership had fallen off drastically . Later she was to publish a newssheet called I AM Ascended Masters Youth in Action , published by " Miracles , Inc. " of Denver . During World War II LeFevre served in the Army and was  | honorably discharged in 1945 as a captain . Soon thereafter , he went with his wife on a cross-country lecture tour " in a pilgrimage for world peace . " Their tour was financed by the Falcon Lair Foundation , a nonprofit group interested in religion , philosophy and government whose headquarters were " Falcon Lair , " Beverly Hills , California , formerly the home of screen idol Rudolph Valentino . ( One of the buildings at the Freedom School is named Falcon Lair . ) In 1950 LeFevre ran unsuccessfully for Congress in a Republican primary and then went to work for an anti-union organization called the Wage Earners Committee . A year or so later the committee was sued by two movie producers , Stanley Kramer and Dore Schary , for picketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ruth Dazey ( now the editor of Rampart Journal ) were among the defendants , but the case died out as the Wage Earners Committee disintegrated . A few years later LcFevrc went to work for the right wing in a big way . I-Ic became a vice-president of Merwin K. Hart 's National Economic Council , a director of the Congress of Freedom , a director of the U.S. ( sometimes United States ) Day Committee ? whose purpose it was to diminish in importance the observation of October 23 as United Nations Day ? and an adviser to Harry Everingham 's We , The People ! The U.S. Day Committee made headlines in 1954 , at the same time as Edgar Bundy , when LeFevre led an attack on the Girl Scout Handbook as having too many references to the U.N . The Scouts retreated , reporting that more than forty changes had been made ? about half of which were due to LeFevre 's criticism . That same year LeFevre moved to Colorado Springs and began to write editorials for R. C. Hoiles ' Gazette-Telegraph . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total output so far has been three thousand articles " all written in a patriotic , libertarian vein . " Two years later he founded the Freedom School , where he has been ever since . What drives LeFevre personally and the Freedom School ideologically ? indeed , forms the bedrock upon which all courses are based ? is a complicated philosophy that , in essence , rejects all government today as a barbaric tool of coercion . Government ,  | although it may have had its uses at some point in the past , is seen as an anachronism in today 's complicated world . LeFevre claims in his book , The Nature of Man And His Government ( Caxton Printers , Caldwell , Idaho , 1963 ) , that government is just another tool of man 's devising , no better nor worse than the men who created it , and is calculated to make men stronger and better able to protect themselves . Strength , he writes , is found in compulsive unity . Therefore , " government , inherently , places individualism at a low point on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . Government is inescapably concerned with unity . Individuals are the necessary victims . " To maintain this unity , he writes , governments are required to use force ; thus individuals , he reasons , are again the losers . When conformity is at a premium , then individuality goes for a discount . He describes it as follows : A peaceful and law-abiding citizen , for example , may have perfectly sound and moral reasons why he does not wish to share his money with the government or the politicians of Yugoslavia . His conviction can be logically derived , morally certain and sincerely maintained . In holding to his conviction , the individual is harming no one . His belief is not inimical to the welfare of other people . Actions which might spring from his belief are not aggressive . In other words , physically , mentally and morally , such a citizen can be above reproach . Yet , when the government adopts a policy which prescribes the sharing of his earnings with a foreign government , the man who objects to this can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be treated and for the same reason . The government can not brook a deviationist.2 Every citizen therefore , somehow , somewhere , is the victim of the aggressive tactics of government . " There is almost no activity in which human beings engage , " he writes , " which is free of legality . Think what you will , do what you will , there is a law somewhere which either compels , limits or prohibits . . . . Thus the average person today , buttressed in by the government , surrounded and overshadowed by government , finds himself a lawbreaker several times during an average day . "  | But this , maintains LeFevre , is entirely in keeping with the function of government . Its job is to pass laws , not repeal them . He views government as a body selling compulsion that the people must buy in advance but who are never in a position to refuse to buy . Unlike the free marketplace , he adds , where man can enter or avoid depending on his own inclination , man has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Government 's classic job , he continues , is to make war on government 's enemies , whether it be the individual , the clan , the tribe , the community , the society or the foreign body . With the exception of the last-mentioned , each of these smaller entities can rob , pillage , riot and destroy but , he says , only government can conduct a war . The only true function of government , he adds , is to protect the peaceful from the belligerent ; unfortunately , he says , the rules are extended and expanded to such extremes that the state itself soon becomes man 's mortal foe . Unlike other tools that man devises , government is not controllable by its creators . It becomes , he says , " a ravening monster " that knows no restraint . Therefore , the problem is , first , how do you control the tool you devised ? Second , since the essence of any progress is the refining and improvement of the tools used , how can government be changed to be brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no answers . " We are trying to explore areas in which the nonpolitical structure can be used , " he told me . He claims he is not recommending the abandonment of government for those who want it . But he does feel that not everyone should have to submit to it or receive its benefits . " Just imagine a situation , " he said , " where there was no government . Just think how human relationships would change if everyone had to solve their own problems without relying on an instrument of coercion . " He claims his ultimate goal is to see returned to man the qualities of character and responsibility and the recognition that he supports himself ? qualities taken away , he says , by government . LeFevre , who is a large , gregarious and pleasant man with white curly hair , denied to me that his ideas amounted to anarchy , as so many of his critics have suggested . " First of all , " he said , " we at the school are a-political . We are Stoics and prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant self-rule or self-sufficiency . LeFevre 's argument is based on the thesis that man is absolutely dependent on property . " This is not only true of humans , " he said , " but of all animals as well . " He pointed out that lion trainers , for instance , have sensed this for years ; they realize that there is a certain point past which they can not cross or the lion will attack . " Our ability to survive , " continued LeFevre , " is predicated on our ability to dominate a portion of our environment . What does me good is the food I eat , not what you eat . Whatever the government takes that is rightfully mine , then it is a criminal . " All morality , he went on , is predicated on private property : five of the Ten Commandments tell you , he notes , not to take another 's property . The Latin word proper , he said , implies moral and proprietary conduct ; in other words , proper conduct is conduct decided by the owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , a boundary and is subject to the control of the owner . " Every immoral act in the world , " he said , " is a trespass of a property boundary . Property has no rights , but all human rights are rights to property . " LeFevre is a persuasive speaker . He fortifies his position by saying that his views are not airtight but need to be worked on by everyone . He only asks that his students snap out of the intellectual slough in which they have been living and begin to rethink things out for themselves . His arguments are so cogently put that , at the end of a two-week session at the Freedom School , the students come reeling out of the classrooms , their self-confidence shaken and their previous notions thrown into a state of confusion . Robert Welch , for one , is furious at what LeFevre is doing because , he says , it is neutralizing many people who might otherwise be good fighters in the antiCommunist cause . Welch maintains that the students of LeFevre 's philosophy come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no point in , for instance , voting ( something , incidentally , that LeFevre proudly claims he does not do ) or fighting Communists , since in their own minds the whole order must be overturned.3 LeFevre dismisses this criticism with a smile and a wave of the hand . He believes that his views are nearly to the point of  | becoming a vogue ? soon to sweep the academic and political worlds like a prairie fire . Harding College is a coeducational four-year school on a fortyacre campus in Searcy , Arkansas , a town of 7,500 situated in farm country fifty miles northeast of Little Rock . Since its early beginnings in 1910 , the purpose of the college has been to provide sound education with a strong emphasis on religion and Christian morals . The curriculum is limited to liberal arts courses , and the school 's Christian emphasis is restricted to the Fundamentalist dogma of the Church of Christ . Today there are 1,200 students , an endowment of over $13 million and a 96-man faculty with full scholastic accreditation . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the National Education Program , located on the Harding campus , and for all intents and purposes so intertwined with the college that the differences become meaningless . The NEP is also sometimes known as The American Heritage Center , and the whole operation is usually referred to collectively as " Harding , " " the NEP " or " the Searcy complex . " Of particular interest is the man behind the entire operation : Dr. George Stuart Benson . Benson , himself a graduate of Harding , class of 1925 , spent eleven years as a missionary and teacher in South China . He was a professor of English at Sun Yat Sen University in Canton for one year and then the president for six years of the Canton Bible School , which he founded . In 1936 he returned to the United States and took over the reins of his alma mater , which at that time could boast of only two buildings , 200 ' ' students , no accreditation and a $75,000 debt . The same year he started the National Education Program . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to emphasize the importance of Constitutional Government and private ownership of property and of faith in God as revealed in the Bible through the Old and the New Testaments . . . . We are strong for the personal freedom that we consider to be a God-given heritage to man and we have great faith in the private enterprise economy which  | developed into the most efficient and fruitful economy that man has ever known under our personal freedoms as guaranteed by our Constitution . " Therefore , we look upon the three great supporting pillars of our American way of life as : Faith in God , Constitutional Government and Private Ownership of Property . " Recalling his feelings back in 1936 , Benson said in a 1961 interview : " I was shocked and saddened at the lack of understanding and appreciation which most Americans seemed to have of their country and their heritage . They seemed beaten by adversity , disillusioned with democracy , ready to give up a free-enterprise system , which , even in the depths of the depression , gave them a standard of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost their Christian convictions and their sense of moral purpose and were listening to all manner of false prophets . " Having seen despotism and totalitarianism at first hand in the Orient , I knew where this would lead , and I began talking about it to everyone who would listen . " Thus the NEP was founded to reverse this trend ; and in the interval , it has grown into perhaps the largest right-wing propaganda source . No group distributes more literature or offers so much equipment , props and aids extolling the free enterprise system as the Searcy complex ( except perhaps the John Birch Society , but , then , much of its literature and equipment comes from the NEP ) . It runs on a remarkably small budget of $250,000 , although much of the overhead is undoubtedly absorbed by Harding . Approximately 45 percent of contributions come in the form of grants , the rest from sale and rental of materials . Large donations in the past have come from the Sloan Foundation , whose gift of $300,000 in 1949 first put the NEP into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance a series of " American Adventure " film cartoons . The Alcoa Foundation gave $1,246,168 in 1962 . Other large gifts have come from the Chrysler Corporation , the Volker Fund , Independence Foundation , Armco Foundation and the Reader 's Digest Foundation . The largest gift of all came from a private individual , the late Harry R. Kendall , an Evanston , Illinois , insurance executive . He gave $2.5 million in  | the mid-1950s . The NEP also made some money by buying radio station WHBQ in Memphis in 1946 for $300,000 and leasing it out for a fifteen-year period in 1954 for nearly $3 million . The quantitative output of the NEP is indeed prodigious . " If you are going to move Washington to do the things it ought to do , " said Benson , " you have got to move public opinion . My aim is to move public opinion at the grass roots in the direction of godliness and patriotism . " 4 The following are some of the major items that the NEP sends out among the public : Benson writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailed to 3,000 newspapers and journals ; it concentrates on emphasizing the advantages of the American private enterprise system . Another weekly column , called " Listen Americans , " is written expressly for industrial employee publications and is published in over 900 house organs . The combined audience of these two columns together is estimated at 20 million weekly . The National Program Letter is the NEP 's main propaganda piece . It is a four-page newssheet of opinion that sells for $1 for a year 's subscription . It has a circulation near 30,000 . The purpose of the Letter is to influence the nation 's " thought leaders . " Approximately 35 percent are mailed out under industrial sponsorship , the remainder on individual request . The NEP also produces films . Currently it is offering thirty-four 16 mm films ? many of them in color ? to anyone wishing to pay the rent on them . Some have been distributed through theatres owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ; others have gone to schools , civic groups , clubs , churches and industries . The most famous of the NEP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an estimated 15 million Americans have seen . This 45-minute Technicolor production , done with professional skill , shows America lying helpless before the brutal and beguiling Communist conspiracy . It shows General George C. Marshall 's efforts in the Far East as being responsible for the communization of China ; it claims that Czechoslovakia succumbed because it had allowed a coalition government to be established ; and it shows the 1960 student riots in San Francisco as being manipulated by members of the Communist conspiracy . At the fadeout , the entire world is either Pink  | or Red save for Switzerland , Spain and the United States , and upon them a question mark has been placed . Norman Thomas , for one , is highly critical of the film because , he says , the theme is misleading ; Communists and Socialists are pictured as one and the same , which , he points out , is far from the truth . It is also apparent that much of the material for the film was taken verbatim from the Birch Society 's Blue Book and the yearly " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Another popular film is " Adventures in Economics , " a cartoon series of ten films . The work is of high professional quality and was produced by John Sutherland , a former Disney executive . The stories promote the free enterprise system in a semi-humorous way . The major character is " Dr. Utopia , " who has an ism for all ills . One film of this series , called " Fresh Laid Plans , " depicts an owl as an expert on how to solve the economic problems in " Eggville " ; eventually the owl 's suggestions destroy the economy of the egg producers . This film has been considered by some viewers as a satire on the Brannan Plan , but it is denied by Dr Benson . Some 35 million people have seen this series . Other films produced by the NEP are " American Adventure , " another series of ten films which show how American capitalism developed ; " The Republic of Apathy , " a half-hour satire showing what can happen if a person does not vote ( among other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embraces communism ) ; " The Two Berlins , " a short documentary comparing life on both sides of the wall ; and " Communism in Action , " a two-part film showing how communism grows and what life is like behind the Iron Curtain . In addition , the NEP puts out a number of 35 mm filmstrips , again dealing with communism and the American citizen 's responsibilities . An estimated 50 million people have seen these series . The cartoon motion pictures , " Adventures in Economics " and " American Adventure " are also offered to television stations . More than 130 commercial and educational stations , with a weekly audience of 30 million , have used this material . Some of the other items offered by the NEP are flannelboard presentations ( one is entitled " The Power of Your Vote " ; another  | is " Communism 's Invisible Weapon " ) ; prepared speeches ; and high-school course outlines which include suggested books to read . The NEP also holds " Freedom Forums , " which are one-day affairs aimed at leaders in industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seminars of five days duration are held at various colleges , the purpose of which is to " inspire and challenge . . . students to become more actively interested in their American heritage . " Tapes and speech reprints of these meetings are widely distributed . For instance , over 500,000 copies of a speech on brainwashing by Major William E. Meyer have been mailed out . The Searcy complex also sells a speech called " The Structure of the American Way of Life . " For twenty-five dollars , a forty-inchhigh " structure " of styrofoam can be used to illustrate the speech itself . This structure shows a base labeled " Fundamental belief in God , " a pedestal labeled " The United States Constitution designed to serve the people , " two columns listing the " Political and Economic rights protected by our laws " ( the " Right to worship , " the " Right to make a profit , " etc. ) and , at the top , a block reading " The American way of life , our freedom , " which in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very similar to the one sold by Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge. * footnote The relationship between the NEP and Freedoms Foundation has been a close one . Benson and his colleagues have won a number of Freedoms Foundations awards . Benson himself has won nine over the years , including the " George Washington Medal , " the most coveted by right-wing groups and one which Benson unabashedly calls " the Nation 's highest honor . " The Foundation itself was founded in 1949 by Don Belding of Foote , Cone &; Belding , Edward F. Hutton of E. F. Hutton &; Company , and Kenneth D. Wells , a former businessman who now serves as the Foundation 's executive vice-president and director . The primary function of the Foundation is to give awards ( some eight hundred a year ) to those who excel in selling the American way of life . Its new colonial-style offices near Valley Forge Park feature a " briefing room , " a " Congressional Medal of Honor Grove , " a court commemorating the original thirteen states ( around each state 's flagpole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Declaration of Independence ) , a " Patriots ' Wall , " an " American Rifleman Gate , " a " Credo monument " and a " Heroic statue of George Washington at prayer . " Some of these items are still in the planning stage . Despite the fact that many prominent Americans are associated with the Foundation , including President Eisenhower , it is often accused of promoting shallow jingoism and " instant tradition . "  | The Harding-NEP philosophy is little different from that of , say , Billy James Hargis ( who , incidentally , feels very close to Benson and his views ) . The danger from outside the country , Benson believes , is minimal compared to America 's internal fifth column . He is convinced that the day the Communists actually take over the United States is closer than most people believe . The take-over itself will be peaceful , he says , because the will to resist will be destroyed unless Americans wake up and do something about it as he is doing . One other aspect of the NEP should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other colleges : Oklahoma Christian College in Oklahoma City , King 's College in Briarcliff Manor , New York , and Pepperdine College in Los Angeles . The closest relationship is maintained with Oklahoma Christian College , where Benson has served as chancellor since 1956 ( he commutes back and forth in his private plane ) . In 1958 , the college ( then called Central Christian College ) held its first Freedom Forum and a year later established the American Citizenship Training Center modelled after the NEP . These Freedom Forums are sometimes called Citizenship Seminars and are now yearly affairs on the campus in Oklahoma City . Past speakers have included W. Cleon Skousen ; John Noble , for nine years a Soviet prisoner , who lectures on his experiences ; Charles Shuman , the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation ; ex-Congressman Walter Judd and Benson himself . King 's College channels its Americanism courses through a division of the institution called the National Freedom Education Center . Its executive director is Carleton Campbell , a medical doctor who was so impressed by the NEP activities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are many similarities between Benson 's and Campbell 's programs , there is no direct affiliation . The NFEC also holds forums , mostly in " enemy territory " ? New York City ? and features such speakers as Dr. Howard Kershner of the Christian Freedom Foundation , Clarence Manion , Herbert Philbrick and Major General Charles A. Willoughby . The Center has also produced a filmstrip , " Challenge to  | Citizenship , " which both the Center and the NEP offer for rental or sale . Pepperdine College , like King 's College , is not directly tied to Benson 's NEP , although Benson does take credit for setting up what is vaguely called Pepperdine 's " citizenship program . " Its director is William C. Teague , who was formerly at Harding College ; Pepperdine 's director of business relations was also associated with the Searcy complex for many years . Pepperdine holds Freedom Forums featuring such speakers as Dr. Frederick Von Hayek , a well-known conservative economist who is accorded almost as much reverence by intellectuals on the right as Ludwig Von Mises , Milton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of international studies at Stanford University 's Hoover Institute on War , Revolution and Peace , and a member of Barry Goldwater 's " brain trust " ; Lemuel Boulware , a former General Electric vice-president ; and Richard Arens , former staff director of the HCUA . According to a 1962 brochure , Pepperdine also produces a weekly radio broadcast on the Mutual network " presenting the message of American free enterprise , " with singer Pat Boone as narrator . One of Pepperdine 's most ambitious projects is a thirteen-film series on the theme of " Crisis for Americans . " The films are being produced in Hollywood and are narrated by radio personality Harry Von Zell . By 1964 , three films had been completed , one on coexistence , another one on Communist imperialism and a third on the Communist accent on youth . The latter features Colonel William Mayer and Dr. Robert Strausz-Hupe , the latter a director of the Foreign Policy Research Institute at the University of Pennsylvania . 3 The three " idea " groups ? Foundation for Economic Education , the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtly in their own views on what the economic and political life in America ought to be , but each organization varies considerably in temper and direction .  | They differ from the NEP in that they are seeking to reach the thought leaders in America ? perhaps 50,000 people from students to union leaders ? not the average man in the street . They differ as well from LeFevre 's operations in that they do not question the need for government , only its size and true function . Because these three are interested primarily in ideas and avoid any hint of activism , they seldom make the headlines and , consequently , are virtually unknown to the public at large . The Mecca of right-wing intellectualism is Irvington-on-Hudson , New York , where the Foundation for Economic Education is located . It was founded in 1946 by Leonard Read , now its president and formerly a U.S. Chamber of Commerce official . All the well-known conservative thinkers write for FEE 's magazine , The Freeman , or if they do not write for it , they are honored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and head of the Department of Economics at Grove City College ( an institution largely financed by the Pew family ) in western Pennsylvania ; R. C. Hoiles ; Henry Hazlitt , the Newsweek columnist and economist ; Benjamin A. Rogge , professor of political economy at Wabash College ; Milton Friedman ; F. A. Hayek and Ludwig Von Mises . From times past there is Adam Smith , Herbert Spencer , John Stuart Mill , Wilhelm Ropke , John Hamilton , John Jay and James Madison . The problem as FEE sees it , according to its literature , is as follows : " State interventionism ? popularly called socialism , communism , Fabianism , Nazism , the welfare state , the planned economy or whatever ? grows rapidly here in the U.S.A. and elsewhere not because this progressive ' ideology lacks opponents but because there are so few who adequately understand and can competently and attractively explain interventionism 's opposite : the free market , private property , limited government philosophy and its moral and spiritual antecedents . " Leonard Read sees FEE 's job , therefore , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of explaining it with everimproving clarity . . . . In short , we specialize in aiding those who would become more skilled and eloquent explainers of the private enterprise or freedom philosophy . " The ideal American government in FEE 's view is one that  | applies only enough power and coercion to prevent illiberal persons from trespassing on the liberty of others . FEE men do not believe that governmental controls are a cure for every social ill . Individual liberty , they say , is being replaced by a concept that represses the actions of others by substituting the plans of rulers . Government , they believe , should get out of private enterprise ? and this includes TVA and the Post Office ; it should not be a regulatory agent ; it should not be involved in welfare , education or any other function that historically has been reserved to the states or private individuals . Such a state of affairs ? were the government out of the activities ? would provide the maximum of liberty for the individual and would herald the dawn of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her citizens would surpass anything anyone dreamed could take place . FEE believes itself to be unique in that it is calling for selfimprovement as distinguished from attempts to call for the reform of others . The latter , it claims , is the primary impetus which drives the current " statist " leaders in America . According to Dr. W. M. Curtiss , FEE 's executive secretary , FEE is not an action group ; nor does it intend to present both sides of an argument . Curtiss believes that there are too many " liberal " points of view being promoted . The term " liberal , " he adds , is a misnomer ; in the classical sense of the term , those who believe in libertarian conservatism are the true liberals . Today 's " liberals , " he argues , are actually radicals and totalitarians who have no faith in the abilities of the ordinary citizen . The current crop of leaders , he maintains , have contempt for the citizen who wishes to take care of himself . " The main difficulty today , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people say our ideas are too ethereal . Well , we believe that there are things that are right and wrong . We try to find out what is right and hold it up as a light for others to follow . " Curtiss reflects the general conservative 's repugnance against what is believed to be the current vogue of splitting all questions down the middle ? unlimited pragmatism , as some call it ? where all questions are solved by compromise and where principles often go by the board . As one person put it to me : " There is no such thing as being half pregnant ; you either are or you aren't. "  | This endless compromising is seen by Leonard Read as an often undetectable erosion that only becomes visible when most of the freedom has been lost . He writes : While most of our lost freedom is in the form of a gradual and indefinable erosion , there are instances where the loss is already completed and , thus , can be specifically named . These instances , however , are not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom a specific instance applies . Suppose , for example , one were to reply , " I have lost the freedom to plant all the tobacco I please on my own land . " Who cares , except that infinitesimal part of the population who might want to grow tobacco ? Or , " I have lost the freedom to work for anyone at less than $1.25 per hour . " Again , who cares , except those unfortunate individuals whose services are n't worth this much ? Or , " I have lost the freedom to pick up a passenger at the Greater Cincinnati Airport in my own taxicab . " Who cares , except Cincinnati taxicab operators ? Or , " I have lost the freedom to competitively price services rendered by my own railroad . " Who cares , except the few owners of railroads ? Or , " I have lost the freedom to raise whatever grain I please to feed my own chickens . " Most voters do n't raise chickens and , thus , have little concern for the plight of those few.5 It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached , FEE believes , if the trend toward " oppressive " government control is to be reversed . One thought leader of particular interest is the educator . " We need to reach the people who write textbooks , " says Curtiss ; " we 'll never change Paul Samuelson ; he 's made up his mind . We 're trying to reach those uncommitted in their economic philosophy who will be the thought leaders . " In this regard , FEE holds seminars through the year ? some sixteen in 1965 , for instance ? where current and potential leaders are brought together for intensive discussions . As many as sixty individuals might attend a seminar , although the mean average is closer to thirty-five . FEE also tries to reach the potential leaders through its monthly journal , The Freeman , which is mailed to over sixty thousand individuals and institutions . All the articles are scholastic in their approach to problems ; never do the authors discuss day-to-day  | issues . " We try to provide the seedstock material for others to use , " said Curtiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The New Liberalism " to Henry Hazlitt 's " Back to Gold ? " Another weapon in FEE 's arsenal is a looseleaf pamphlet called " Cliches of Socialism , " a series of refutations of some of the more common cliches . My edition lists seventy-three rebuttals , some of the titles ( read : cliches ) of which are : " Why , you 'd take us back to the horse and buggy , " " I 'm a middle-of-the-roader , " " Federal aid is all right if it does n't bring federal control , " " Socialism is the wave of the future " and " I 'm for free enterprise ? BUT ! " Leonard Read has written most of the replies to these cliches , followed by Sennholz , Rogge , Hazlitt and Paul Poirot , The Freeman 's managing editor . FEE is supported entirely by contributions from some twelve thousand individuals . A few large corporations contribute , among them General Motors , Dupont , Chrysler , Gulf Oil , Montgomery Ward , U.S. Steel , Armour and B. F. Goodrich . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in keeping with its philosophy , FEE refuses to apply for a tax-free status . FEE believes that it must sink or swim on its own merits . " FEE receives precisely what it deserves , " reads one pamphlet . The Foundation believes that the educational process will be a long one . " We look at this problem as a real long-term deal , " said Curtiss . " We wo n't return to freedom in your lifetime , certainly not in the way we would like to see it . . . . The only way we can measure success today is with individuals . I think there are more people today who understand the importance of freedom , even though the country is more socialistic today than it ever was . " Curtiss pondered this thought for a moment and then said : " One of our problems is that people get discouraged . You have to develop a sense of humor in order to live with the situation . " What the right wing needs , he concluded , is a Mencken . A soulmate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-Manhattan . It was founded in 1939 " to help bring  | about a better understanding of American business so that friction among economic groups may be reduced and the benefits of American capitalism may become more apparent to everybody . " The founder and the current chairman is Fred G. Clark , an insurance and oil executive . His assistant is Richard S. Rimanoczy , a former advertising executive . The AEF operates on a budget of $600,000 per year , much of the money being supplied by the same corporations that finance FEE . The American Economic Foundation differs from FEE in that it concentrates on educating high school students . The more complex theories emanating from FEE are often distilled into simple terms so that the relatively unsophisticated minds of the young can better understand them . This organization also differs from FEE in that it sometimes enters the current political scene to comment on events or individuals with which it takes exception . The AEF carries out a number of educational programs , the most recent example receiving wide notice being " The Hall of Free Enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fair . On a more long-term basis , the Foundation provides kits , films , wall charts , pamphlets and books to high schools . Some of this material has been characterized as a " hard sell " for the American competitive system . The AEF 's best-known book is How We Live by both Clark and Rimanoczy . It claims to present " the basic blueprint of man 's economic life . " Over three million copies of this book have reportedly been sold . Some of the better-known pamphlets include " Not by Bread Alone , " " Let 's Face the Facts of Inflation " and an " Economic Fallacy " series subtitled " The Things We Know ' that Are Not So . " The Foundation also runs " Teachers Institutes , " seminars designed to stress the need for economic education . They are held in over a hundred colleges in thirty-five states and the District of Columbia . Materials supplied by the AEF at these Institutes have been placed in educational systems embracing more than seven thousand high schools . The philosophy guiding the AEF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisdom " and expanded upon in How We Live . The Pillars are conservative in character and read , for instance , " Government is never a source of goods , " " Nothing in our material world can come from nowhere and go nowhere , nor  | can it be free . . . , " and " Wages are the principle cost of everything . " Clark believes that the income tax is " a law that is so bad , so poorly conceived , so inefficient , so unfair , so complex , and so debilitating , indeed so cancerous , that it must be removed from the economic body of our nation . . . . " On labor unions he has written : " Incidentally , can you name one single labor leader since Samuel Gompers who ever defended management 's right to a fair profit ? " Those who have worked in the New Deal , New Frontier and ADA he has called " witch doctors , " and Walter Reuther he has called " a pious champion of reckless spending . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and day-to-day developments to dispense its economic ideas to the future leaders of this country . 5 The last " idea " group is the Intercollegiate Studies Institute ( formerly the Intercollegiate Society of Individualists ) , located off Independence Square in Philadelphia . It was founded in 1953 and grew out of a 1950 article in Human Events by the late Frank Chodorov in which he said : " If Socialism has come to America because it was implanted in the minds of past generations , there is no reason for assuming that the contrary idea can not be taught to a new generation . " A businessman read these words and sent Chodorov a check for $1,000 , suggesting that he start something along these lines . In its first year ISI operated as a mailing-list organization out of the Human Events office . Then it moved to FEE 's offices in Irvington-on-Hudson , where it remained until 1958 , after which it moved to its present location . The first president of ISI was William F. Buckley , Jr. ? a " figurehead , " as he recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man who actually runs the Institute today is E. Victor Milione , the executive vice-president . Milione previously was associated with an organization called Americans for the Competitive Enterprise System , which organized industrial tours for high school students . According to Milione , ISI is a nonprofit educational organization with a budget of $250,000 , all of which is raised through  | contributions . There are no members of the Institute and no dues , but there is a 25,000-name mailing list from which contributions are solicited . Similar to FEE and AEF , the Institute makes no effort to deal with current political issues ; its approach is also academic . Most observers , including critics , acknowledge that the treatment of issues is generally of a very high caliber . ISI does differ , however , in who it wishes to influence . While FEE dispenses ideas to all those uncommitted who might be thought leaders , and while AEF concentrates on high school students , ISI is solely concerned with influencing college students and young professors . The crux of ISI 's philosophy , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking the truth at a college and the preaching of an ideology and that this conflict , whether left or right , is often weighed too much in favor of the ideology . " The seeking of truths is the most important aspect of education , " he said ; " the real goal is to provide a man with the ability to make his own decisions . " Attendant to this view is the belief that educational institutions are caught in a dilemma trying to satisfy three needs at one time : the individual 's need in terms of his own uniqueness , community needs and specialist needs . Milione believes that too much emphasis is being placed on the latter two . " ISI objects to anyone ? Schlesinger or Welch ? getting up and saying This is the truth ' and not educating the student to the point where he can make his own valid judgments , " said Milione . " Harvard and Yale have tremendous prestige , " he went on , " and the implication is that they know what is right , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . " He said that there is no university in the United States ? particularly the large , well-known " liberal " ones ? nor any body of knowledge that promotes " wholeness , " that is to say , the fully educated individual . " Instead of broadening the student 's knowledge , " Milione added , " the universities are actually encouraging his provincialism by providing for only certain aspects of his needs . " ISI hopes to fill that void . This attitude toward education translates out as a conservative philosophy because it reflects the belief that were the scales to tip in favor of " truth " ( as opposed to " ideology " ) , the majority if not  | all the students would reject the socialist , collectivist and totalitarian indoctrination that they apparently are receiving today . In their hearts , and from a longe-range point of view , ISIers are wedded to seeking the truth ? and it is certainly reflected in their intellectual efforts ; but on a day-to-day basis , they seem to be saying : " If ideology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative variety . " On a more general level , ISI has no one strong philosophical thread . Some of the writers to its magazine , The Intercollegiate Review , are followers of Ayn Rand , others are disciples of Ludwig Von Mises , and yet others are a kind of intellectual YAFer . But all those who associate themselves with ISI stand opposed to the trends of the past thirty-five years . They oppose " relativism , " Keynesianism , statism , liberalism and anything to the left of these isms . ISIers talk in terms of freedom , laissez faire , private property , minimum government , and other conservative thoughts much like someone from FEE , AEF and YAF . ISI seeks to put across its point of view in five ways : publications , a club program , summer schools , lectures and a fellowship program . The Intercollegiate Review is one of the better produced intellectual journals on the collegiate scene , showing professionalism in its layout and a very high quality in its subject matter . One issue may carry articles such as " Moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brandt , and " The Dilemmas of Disarmament , " by Stefan T. Possony . Another might carry such articles as " The Relation Between Power and Values in the Nuclear Age , " by William R. Kintner , " National Self-Defense and Political Existence , " by Gerhart Niemeyer , and " Imperialism : The Threat to Existence , " by Leo Paul de Alvarez . Two other publications are ISI Campus Report , a roundup of ISI club activities , lectures and notices of new books and articles ; and Under 30 , a semi-annual digest of the best articles from many conservative campus magazines . The club program has experienced considerable success since it was initiated back in the early days of the organization . Today there are some one hundred clubs on as many campuses with a total membership of twenty-eight thousand . The only requirement  | demanded of a club is that it ? for a switch ? not be closely associated with ISI headquarters in Philadelphia . Milione believes that each club should be independent , capable of standing on its own feet and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This enforced separation also allows ISI to disassociate itself from any group which decides to go off on its own tack , a problem aggravated by the high turnover ( completely every four years or so ) in all the clubs . Furthermore , every club is expected to be solely an educational group and not a political activist one . These clubs go by a variety of names , the most common being The Conservative Club . The University of Chicago Conservatives publish the New Individualist Review , perhaps the best known of all these journals ; the club at Harvard is called the Charles River Literary Society and publishes a glossy quarterly called The Harvard Conservative ; The University Society of Individualists at Berkeley publishes Man and State ; the University of Pennsylvania has its Eleutherian Society and a publication called Analysis ; and Cornell 's Conservative Club puts out a journal called The Gentlemen of the Right . ISI holds numerous summer schools , a program that was initiated in 1960 . Again , these meetings feature as speakers some of the most respected names among conservatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Robert Strausz-Hupe and Senator John Tower . Approximately three schools are held each year , one in the East , another in the Midwest and a third on the West Coast . Lectures and seminars are also held throughout the scholastic year at all of the clubs . The same caliber of men teaching at the summer schools is available for these sessions . A high standard of scholarship is maintained . Topics such as " The Revolt of the Sophists , " " The Behavioral Approach and the Nothing-But Fallacy " and " Behavioralism and Economics " are typical of those presented . Under ISI 's fellowship program , ten fellowships per year are awarded to graduate students in economics and political science . They are each worth $1,500 plus tuition , and the money comes from private foundations . The recipient , in order to qualify , must state his intention of teaching upon completion of his studies . This  | is ISI 's way of trying to change the educational system at its heart . To many conservatives active on the political scene , the true value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow 's battles . Some of those exposed to the ISI view go off into the fringes , but many others do not . Most eventually gravitate into the Republican and Democratic Parties where their conservative views are beginning to act as a counterforce to the young left-wingers . The number of Young Turks active on the political scene who cut their teeth in ISI is impressive . There is William Buckley , M. Stanton Evans , William H. Regnery , John G. Pew , Jr. , of the Sun Oil family , James Kilpatrick , the editor of the Richmond News Leader , Garry Wills , assistant professor of classics at Johns Hopkins , Richard Whalen of the Wall Street Journal , Edwin McDowell of the Arizona Republic and the author of Barry Goldwater : Portrait of an Arizonan and , finally , a number of energetic youths who are active in Young Americans for Freedom and Human Events . Milione is confident that sometime in the foreseeable future the opinions and views of these Young Turks he has promoted will not only be listened to but be dominant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Right and the two that give their heart and soul to the cause are Human Events and National Review . Human Events is a sixteen-page weekly tabloid-type newspaper with a circulation exceeding 100,000 . It is one of the few newspapers with an aggressively right-wing point of view that is available at newsstands , particularly on the East Coast . It was started in 1944 by the late Frank C. Hanighen , a writer , editor and author of muckraking books ( for instance , he was coauthor of The Merchants of Death , an expose of the munitions industry ) . At a luncheon held in Chicago early that year , Hanighen convinced General Robert E. Wood , then Chairman of Sears , Roebuck , Sterling Morton of the salt company , Colonel Charles Lindbergh , Colonel Robert McCormick , W. H. Regnery , Sr. , and two others that the conservatives needed a newsletter from  | Washington , D.C. , that would keep the forces on the right apprised of events and developments there . Hanighen persuaded his listeners that his idea was a good one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newssheet was started . It took its name from the first line of the Declaration of Independence and was printed in such a way at first that each sheet was a separate item capable of being distributed in part yet at the same time appearing to be a complete unit . Thus Hanighen hoped that the original subscribers would pass on the four or five sheets to as many friends . The early days of Human Events were rugged . Circulation for a number of years hovered around the money-losing 10,000 mark . Schemes were devised to increase circulation ( 5,000 copies were offered for $25 , for instance ) ; a plan was once devised to sell Human Events and American Opinion as a package deal , but the scheme fell through because it lost money . But then , in 1961 , the publication 's circulation and sales figures began to climb steeply . From 10,000 in 1954 , circulation passed 85,000 in 1963 and 100,000 in 1965 . Its gross sales of other literature passed the $1 million mark in 1962 . In 1964 Hanighen died and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associate of many years . Wick had previously worked for FEE as general manager of The Freeman and as a staffer on the 1940 Willkie campaign and the 1944 Dewey campaign . Wick has since died and his place has been taken by his son , Milton . The newspaper sees itself , if you will , as both objective and biased . " In reporting the news , " stated one flyer , " Human Events is OBJECTIVE ; it aims for accurate presentation of the facts . But it is not IMPARTIAL . It looks at events through eyes that are BIASED ? in favor of limited constitutional government , states rights , private enterprise and individual freedom . " There is no doubt that Human Events epitomizes those organizations on the right that " view with alarm " the recent trends and developments in the United States . " We will never have efficiency in the service of delivering mail , " read a 1960 article , " until the Post Office is turned over to private enterprise . " It views with alarm Walter Reuther , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ruthless labor dictator and one of the most mischievous  | Socialist leaders in the country . " Civil rights is also suspect ; began a 1961 article : " Throughout the ugly activity of the bus-riding integrationist agitators who have been touring the South to cause trouble , and who have been illegally accommodated by some extremists . . . " The international conspiracy is cause for alarm ; said a 1962 article : " . . . the Administration has deliberately blocked production of advanced aircraft in order to kill off the manned-bomber program . . . , " and then went on to ask : " What other weapons are we not producing because the Russians suggested it ? " The New Frontier was also cause for fear . President Kennedy , said one article , actually headed a " Fabian Socialist Administration . " Another article suggested that Kennedy himself was a " High Class Beatnik . " Nor is President Johnson free from criticism . One 1963 headline read : " President Johnson : Blessed Are the Poor ; they 'll elect me . " James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the President a " counterfeit Confederate . " Even democracy comes under fire ; it was once described as " counting all the heads empty or not . " Human Events views with alarm the appointment of British poet Stephen Spender as Poetry Consultant to the Library of Congress . It views with alarm the new silverless coins , calling them " government slugs . " And it views with considerable alarm CORE , Dr. Spock ( " Peacenik Pediatrician " ) , station KTBC in Austin , Texas , the New Left and peace marchers ( " People Laughed at Hitler 's Marchers , " read one headline ) , Adam Clayton Powell , the War on Poverty , " modern Republicanism , " and all those congressmen who voted for foreign aid , federal aid to education , civil rights , Medicare or the repeal of section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Law . Those who do the viewing with alarm represent a cross section of writers on the right . There is Morrie Ryskind , formerly of the Los Angeles Times ; Ralph de Toledano ; Walter Trohan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice Widener , the publisher of USA magazine ; Westbrook Pegler ; Senator Thomas Dodd ; Ronald Reagan ; labor columnist Victor Riesel ; and Congressmen H. R. Gross ( R. , Iowa ) , Albert Watson ( R. , S.C. ) , Edward Derwinski ( R. , Ill. ) and John Dowdy ( D. , Tex . ) . One of the reasons Human Events maintains such a large  | circulation is that it presents the news in such a manner that it appeals to a wide spectrum of right-wingers . The Bircher may think it too mild and the casual conservative may think it too racy , but both will read it because it presents the news in a lively way . The result is ideological confusion . No one is sure where Human Events stands on the right , and it seems to be a deliberate policy . It does not , for instance , call for the impeachment of Chief Justice Warren , but it does call for Constitutional amendments that , if passed into law , would drastically change the balance-ofpower concept . It does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Nor is it bigoted or totally reactionary , yet it features a few columnists who are . It claims it has no time for third-party politics , but it supported Buckley in the 1965 mayoralty race in New York . At times it is an ardent admirer of Barry Goldwater ; on other occasions it is one of his biggest critics . And so it goes . As long as a person has any identifiable conservative attitudes there is something in the pages of Human Events for him . The newspaper has other interests besides reporting the news . Because it believes that the regular press is biased in favor of " liberals , " it runs a " School of Journalism " in cooperation with ISI . Scholarships are awarded to young conservatives who wish to become reporters . Human Events is also one of the right 's major pamphleteers . The following are samples of its material : " Senator Kennedy 's Right to Loaf ' Bill , " by Frank Chodorov ; " Corruption Unlimited : Urban Renewal , " by James Wick ; " Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Harvey ; " The Web of Warren , " by Frank Hanighen ; and " Communism : A False Religion , " by J. Edgar Hoover . In retrospect , it is quite clear that Human Events has been one of the major beneficiaries of the resurgence among conservative groups since 1960 . It has prospered from the formula of embracing as many conservative views as it can consistent with its policy of presenting the right-wing side of the news . This has paid off in terms of both circulation and profitability , and there is no indication that this policy will be changed .  | National Review , published every other week , is acknowledged to be the best-written and most articulate of all the publications on the right . It was started in 1955 and has built itself up where today it can boast an impressive circulation near the 100,000 mark . Although the magazine does not influence the power wielders in Washington , it nevertheless can shake right-wing mountains . Most of this is due to the style , intelligence and personality of its editor , William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of America 's wealthiest men . At his death , Buckley , Sr. , had amassed a fortune estimated at over $100 million . The family 's privately held Catawba Corporation ( now run by William 's brother , John ) controls oil development concessions on some 60 million acres of land , equivalent to the land mass of England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland . William , Sr. , was the son of a second-generation Scot-Irish immigrant who had made a small fortune in merchandising and sheep-raising in Duval County , Texas . Although his father was a Protestant , William , Sr. , was raised in the Roman Catholic religion of his mother . William , Jr. , inherited his father 's views on individualism , free enterprise and the survival of the fittest . From the beginning he was a precocious and opinionated individual . In 1931 , when he was six years old , he wrote to King George V of England and told him to pay back his country 's war debt . Two days after his arrival at an English school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not like about the institution . Within forty-eight hours of his arrival at an army base , he fired off a letter to the commanding officer deploring wasteful practices and the poor quality of the staff . ( The letter was intercepted before it reached the commanding officer 's desk . ) Buckley graduated from the Millbrook School in upstate New York in 1943 . He then studied at the University of Mexico for a year and soon thereafter joined the Army . He began as a private and was discharged in 1946 as a second lieutenant . He then entered Yale and studied history , political science and economics .  | He served as the chairman of the Yale Daily News , got himself elected to Fence Club and Skull and Bones , and built himself a reputation as a first-class debater . The year after his graduation in 1950 , his book God and Man at Yale was published ( by W. H. Regnery &; Company ) . In it , Buckley argued that his alma mater was full of anti-religious and anti-capitalist attitudes . This point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buckley was soon labeled as the enfant terrible of the renascent right . For the next four years Buckley held three jobs , one as a " regular panelist " for H. L. Hunt 's Facts Forum , another briefly as ISI 's president , and a third as an associate editor of American Mercury . He broke with Mercury 's owner-editor , Russell Maguire , when anti-Semitism began to creep into the pages of the magazine . In 1954 , Buckley co-authored with his brother-in-law , Brent Bozell , McCarthy and His Enemies , a defense of the late Wisconsin senator . The two authors argued that , although charges were sometimes hurled about with considerable abandon , McCarthy nevertheless had rendered the nation a singular service by demanding that people be concerned with their own country 's internal security , particularly within the State Department . National Review was started in 1955 with the financial help of 120 investors . By way of introducing it to the public , Buckley wrote that the magazine planned to stand " athwart history , yelling Stop ' at a time when no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much patience with those who urge it . " His magazine is of the old school of journalism , that which reflected the opinions of one man much in the tradition of , say , Colonel Robert McCormick of the Chicago Tribune or , today , of William Loeb of the Manchester ( N.H. ) Union Leader ? outspoken , opinionated and right-wing . On its fifth birthday , National Review could boast a circulation of 31,913 and debts totaling $860,000 . Its circulation today has tripled , but the finances have improved little . Periodically , the editor has to plead for extra help from his readers , and usually he gets it . Of course , Buckley could personally make up the deficit each year from his own resources , probably without even a  | skipped heartbeat from his personal financial advisers , but it i apparent that he wants to make the publication pay for itself . One reason National Review is constantly in difficult financial straits is it has not yet broken the advertising barrier . That is to say , most of its ads come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Milliken , Schick , Kennametal and Allen-Bradley are names most seen on the advertising pages . The non-ideological advertisers have , on the whole , avoided the magazine . One wonders why , when its readers comprise the bulk of conservative thought leaders in the country . The names on the masthead are an impressive group of rightwing scribes : James Burnham ( an ex-Trotskyist ) , Frank S. Meyer , M. Stanton Evans , Will Herberg , James J. Kilpatrick , Ralph de Toledano , Garry Wills , Brent Bozell , Frank Chodorov , Suzanne LaFollette , Gerhart Niemeyer , Morrie Ryskind , Anthony Lejeune and Elspeth Huxley . Guest writers range from Carol Bauman , the wife of a YAF activist , to Sir Shane Leslie , a relation of Sir Winston Churchill . As if one Buckley were not enough on the staff , one sister is managing editor , another is a columnist , yet another handles the correspondence and Brent Bozell , a brother-in-law , is on the editorial board . William Buckley differs from all other critics on the right in that he uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression that Buckley ever loses his temper . Rather , his pen is dipped in nitric acid ; he has the gift of the scintillating phrase that can be driven home with what seems to be bored understatement ; he can deliver a verbal knife thrust with a toothy smile ; his Henry James-like rhetoric ? some sentences containing half a dozen thoughts linked together by an equal number of subordinate clauses , " howevers , " " but-on-the-other-hands " and " **26;513;TOOLONG " ? can destroy the most cogent arguments by the sheer weight of words . His prowess with words is such that one sometimes gets the impression that he is more concerned with the way he is saying it than what he is saying . Nevertheless , his withering ridicule , his style of delivery and his flashing wit are perhaps the most feared weapons in the possession of the right . He can , for instance , reduce such advocates of liberalism as Norman  | Mailer and James Baldwin ? both articulate when not under stress ? to the point where they become incoherent . Buckley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own called " Firing Line , " now includes visual weapons . Before it cruncher is about to be delivered , he will lick the corner of his mouth , raise his eyes to heaven as if his opponent 's argument were straining his credulity , and then , voice husky and soft , deliver some devastating rejoinder such as : " I wish you would n't sound so fatigued when confronted by historical fact . " Some of Buckley 's rapier-like thrusts should be noted . President Johnson he has called " Uncle Cornpone " ; Pope John XXIII 's encyclical Mater et Magister he believes is " a venture in triviality " ; the 1963 March on Washington he described as " mob deployment " ; Harry Golden he has called " the high priest of left-wing yahooism " ; novelist Gore Vidal , " a philosophical degenerate " ; and Vincent Sheean " the king of gemutlichkeit . " He chided Norman Mailer for his " subpoena envy " when he , Mailer , was not called to testify before a congressional committee investigating the sponsorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jean-Paul Sartre , Simone de Beauvoir , Truman Capote , James Baldwin and Mailer ? " that kind of thing " ? are products of what he calls " the fever swamps of the literary left . " Arthur Schlesinger he has dismissed with : " No one believes anything he says anyway . " John Lindsay he is convinced is " an embarrassment to the two-party system . " Eisenhower , wrote Buckley , " when he was not the laughing stock of the troublemakers , was the explicit object of their contempt . " On the New Frontier he said : " . . . there are n't enough psychiatrists in the world to cure this crazy administration . " David Susskind he labeled " a staunch liberal " and went on to say that " if there were a contest for the title Mr. Eleanor Roosevelt , ' he would unquestionably win it . " When introducing Norman Thomas on his show , Buckley said : " If I were asked what has been his speciality in the course of a long career , I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Buckley or his magazine says about them . An editorial in National Review , for instance , accused Linus Pauling of " acting as a megaphone for Soviet policy " and giving " aid and comfort to the enemies of this country . " Pauling  | sued for $1 million but lost the case because the court ruled that the distinguished chemist was a " public figure " open to the same comment that applies to public officials . Buckley 's political views fall somewhere to the left of the Birch Society 's views . He accepts the standard conservative position that opposes the power of unions , the trend toward state-run welfare , featherbedding and government power . " I will not cede more power to the state , " he wrote . " I will not willingly cede more power to anyone , not to the state , not to General Motors , not to the CIO . I will hoard my power like a miser , resisting every effort to drain it away from me . I will then use my power as I see fit .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a stand pro or con the controversial organization . In the 13 February 1962 issue of National Review , an editorial , presumably written by Buckley , said : " Mr. Welch , for all his good intentions , threatens to divert militant conservative action to irrelevance and ineffectuality . There are , as we say , great things that need doing . . . John Birch chapters can do much to forward these aims , but only as they dissipate the fog of confusion that issues from Mr. Welch 's smoking typewriter . Mr. Welch has revived in many men the spirit of patriotism , and that same spirit calls now for rejecting , out of a love of truth and country , his false councils . " Buckley , like Goldwater , was quick to add that he had considerable admiration for individual Birchers and that he felt it was unreasonable and undiscriminating to condemn all members of the Society out of hand . Public opinion , says Buckley , is a " paper tiger " that inhibits the United States ' role as a world power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Domingo and bombed North Vietnam , " he noted , " and everyone expected a lot of shouting and not very much really happened . " American cities , particularly New York City , he believes have become hotbeds of crime , owing in part to what he calls the liberals ' " anything goes " attitude . " You ca n't walk from one end of New York to another without standing a good chance of losing your wallet , your maidenhead , or your life , " he wrote . Nor does Buckley have much confidence in intellectuals who have the ear of politicians in power . " I would rather be governed , "  | he said , " by the first two thousand people in the telephone directory than by the Harvard University faculty . " But this does not mean that Buckley is an egalitarian . He has said that he would much rather " pothole " the road to the voting booth than broaden it . Occasionally Buckley is ambivalent in his attitude toward " statism . " He favors the statism of congressional investigations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he is against the statism of civil rights laws and aid to public schools . Buckley is best when he is explaining what the American right stands for and what it does not stand for . In his book , Rumbles Right and Left , he explains it to Norman Mailer : The true meaning of the right wing , Mr. Mailer , is commitment , a commitment on the basis of which it becomes possible to take measurements . This is true whether in respect of domestic policy or foreign policy . For those on the radical Left with Norman Mailer , and for so many Americans on the moderate Left , the true meaning of our time is the loss of an operative set of values ? what one might call an expertise in living . For then , there is no ground wire , and without a ground the voltage fluctuates wildly , wantonly , chasing after the immediate line of least resistance ? which , in Cuba , is Do Nothing . For those , like Norman Mailer , who have cut themselves off from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important that a Laos has been dismembered , or that a great wall has gone up through Berlin , or that a Cuba has been Communized : Mailer 's world is already convulsed , at a much higher level , and he has no ear for such trivia as these . For he views the world as groaning under the weight of unmanageable paradoxes , so that Euclidean formulations , Christian imperatives , Mosaic homilies become , all of them , simply irrelevant ; worse , when taken seriously , these are the things that get in the way of his own absorption with himself , in the way of that apocalyptical orgasm which he sees as the end objective of individual experience . How strange it is that all the Establishment 's scholars , all the Establishment 's men , have not in the last half dozen years written half dozen paragraphs that truly probe the true meaning of the American right wing . They settle instead for frenzied , paranoid denunciations . Indeed the Left has discovered that the threat is really internal . There is no enormity too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide-eyed faith . I have seen some of them listen respectfully to the thesis that people in America belong to the right wing out of resentment over their failure to get their sons into Groton. . . .8 Along with all other conservatives , Buckley took umbrage at President Eisenhower when he invited Premier Khrushchev to the United States in 1959 . The following passage illustrates how a conservative such as Buckley views the matter : Last year 1959 Mayor Wagner ostentatiously announced his refusal to greet Ibn Saud ? on the ground that Ibn Saud discriminates against the Jews in Saudi Arabia , and no man who discriminates against Jews in Saudi Arabia is by God going to be handled courteously by Bob Wagner , Mayor of New York . Now , as everyone knows , Nikita Khrushchev not only discriminates against Jews , he kills them . On the other hand , he does much the same thing to Catholics and Protestants . Could that be why Mr. Wagner consented to honor Khrushchev ? Khrushchev murders people without regard to race , color or creed ? that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is guilty of , he is not guilty of discrimination , and so he is entitled to Robert Wagner 's hospitality . Is that the shape of the new rationality ? 7 Buckley sees himself as occupying the dead center of the conservative movement , trying to pull the Birchers away from the more intemperate ideas of Robert Welch and , at the same time , giving hope to the fainthearted conservatives to his left . Even though his views are not airtight , he nevertheless can hold this position with some feeling of security because he is one of the few on the right who skillfully treads the narrow line between advocacy and acceptability . Buckley 's views are not so far beyond the pale that reasonable people dismiss him as unrealistic ; many believe that there are enough seeds of truth in what he is saying that he deserves their attention . On the other hand , he has not slipped sufficiently toward the centers of power where people regard him as one of the Establishment 's more vocal household pets . However , Buckley did put this position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City . He made it clear that he  | was not too serious about it ( on being asked what he would do if he won , he said , " I 'd demand a recount. " ) and that his objective was a negative one ? to defeat the more liberal John Lindsay . Barry Goldwater , who knows what it is like to lose big , called Buckley a " political kamikaze " and a " wrong-way Corrigan . " Somehow Buckley 's reputation survived his defeat , and he still maintains the position he seeks to hold : the most authentic and most respected voice of conservatism in America today . A number of people have noted that there are many similarities between William Buckley and the late President Kennedy . Buckley is immensely wealthy , a Catholic , witty , articulate , athletic , from a large family and with considerable charisma and charm . But there the similarities end . Both have viewed the political world from different points in the spectrum . The Associated Press once felt that the similarities were sufficient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Should President Kennedy and William F. Buckley , Jr. , chance to pass each other on a crowded street they would probably bless themselves and murmur : There but for the Grace of God go I. ' " 8  | Some several trillion years ago an ' unknown black scientist blew up the Moon because the people who lived on it ? " original man " ? refused to speak the same language . From the debris was created the earth , some 36,000 miles out of orbit . What was left of the Moon capsized and everyone fell off and died ; water and life , however , were retained on the earthly fragment . The first and only inhabitants of the earth at that time were black people , members of the Tribe of Shabazz . They lived in South Asia and built a city called Mecca . Caucasians were the product of a 600-year experiment conducted by a genius of the Black Nation called Yakub . He discovered , roughly 6,000 years ago , that black people could be progressively bleached through " mutation , " thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races . In the process of developing the white race , Yakub bred all the goodness , strength and ability ? inherent in the Black Nation , the " original people " ? from it . He had , in fact , created the first real " colored " man ( that is , the extreme deviant from the black norm ) who , because he was weak and generally inferior all around , was branded a " devil . " Yakub , a born troublemaker with a big head , had previously been thrown out of the Black Nation with 59,999 other dissatisfied individuals . To get revenge on Allah , Yakub had created his " devil race . " Yet , there was a grand design to all this . God ( or Allah ) , it seems , chose to allow these " devils " to rule for 6,000 years to test  | the mettle of the Black Nation and the capacity for justice of the white race . The whites have failed in their task of providing justice to the blacks , so their time is up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all whites are now living in a period of grace . It is only a matter of time before the Black Nation once again asserts its authority . Part of God 's divine plan for his people called for a 400-year stint as slaves in North America , which was up in 1955 . On the day of judgment there will be a holocaust . First will come a " spiritual sounding of the trumpet " ? a siren in an airplane ? which will broadcast the beginning of the end . All people will have eight to ten days to decide whether or not they want to leave this " earthly hell . " Come the judgment itself , a " dreadful " wheel-like airplane , one-half mile by one-half mile in size and armed with bombs , poison gas and fire , will destroy all human life ( American whites first , European whites a little later ) except 144,000 " so-called Negroes . " These chosen few will be the vanguard in a " New World " in which peace and happiness will reign supreme . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bible is the Holy Quran . He teaches that the Nation of Islam or Lost-Found Nation ( which is only one part of the black-brown-yellow-red Black Nation ) is God 's " chosen " ; that his chosen are Asiatics ( not Negro ) who created great civilizations while the whites were still " crawling on their hands and knees like beasts of the forest and living on raw meat " ; that there is no life after death ; that Heaven and Hell are just two conditions of life ; and that Caucasians are " wicked , evil , blue-eyed , pale-faced devils " who shall receive their punishment on the judgment day.l In order to understand the Black Muslims , as they are more commonly known , it is necessary to grasp the content of the eschatology above . It shows the black nationalists ' desire to free themselves from the exploited image of blackness and hence from the deep feeling of self-rejection , cultural alienation , and social estrangement which pervade and corrupt the personalities of the Negro  | masses . It expresses the nationalist 's need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esteemed , some center of power , some tradition and , generally , some " central idea " capable of endowing his life with meaning and purpose . It offers hope in a future , one in which blackness will no longer be despised.2 Black nationalism addresses itself to a number of anxieties within the American Negro community . Chief among them are the Negroes ' concern for their identity as a people , which is threatened by integration and assimilation . It reasserts the Negro male 's superiority , particularly as head of the household . As a release for all anxieties , it identifies the cause of them as something concrete and visible ( " blue-eyed , pale-skinned devils " ) , not as a set of vague , seemingly insurmountable pressures . Most important of all , black nationalism seeks an end to the dilemma that finds Negroes freed from bondage for over one hundred years yet still not accepted into the mainstream of American society . Black nationalism is not a new phenomenon in America . Its roots predate the Civil War and can be traced right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Colonization Society , Booker T. Washington , W. E. B. DuBois , Marcus Garvey and his Universal Negro Improvement Association , * and Noble Drew Ali , the " prophet " of the MoorishAmerican Science Temples . Prior to the twentieth century the movements were essentially Negro nationalist in character , concerned with the problems of American Negroes only . Since 1900 , black nationalism has come footnote Marcus Garvey , the " Black Moses , " was a Jamaican who sought to unite all Negroes of the world and establish a country of their own in Africa . He believed that Negroes had to be united by a common consciousness of race and nationality in order to become a great and powerful people . To this end , he set up a variety of corporations ? the Negro Political Union , the Negro Factory Corporation , the Black Star Steamship Company , were but a few of them ? in an effort to increase Negro self-sufficiency and in the belief that such enterprises would help pay for the eventual " repatriation " of American Negroes to Africa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large retainer , called himself " His Highness , the Potentate , " and conferred knighthoods and peerages upon his faithful . In 1925 , Garvey was convicted of using the mails to defraud . He spent two years in jail and was then deported . His UNIA collapsed around him , and he died unheralded in London in 1940 at the age of fifty-three .  | to the fore , preoccupied with the problems of all nonwhite peoples of the world . The black nationalist 's God , although black in spirit , came to America in the form of a light-skinned Negro of oriental mien called W. D. Fard , also known as Walli Farrad , Professor Ford , F. Mohammed Ali , Farrad Mohammed , and Allah ( God ) . Little is known of his background . His mother was a bleached-blonde " devil " of uncertain trade known as " Baby Gee . " His father was known only as Alphonso , sometimes described as " a Jet Black Man of the Tribe of Shabazz . " Fard had previous arrests on charges of narcotics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years in San Quentin Prison . Fard appeared in Detroit in 1930 as a peddler of silks in " Paradise Valley , " the local Negro slum . Before long he was the leader of a small cult of " Moors " with headquarters in a Temple of Islam . By 1933 he was reputed to have eight thousand followers . Some of his faithful believed he was " the Mandi 's prophet , " others the reincarnation of Noble Drew Ali himself , still others God . Fard disappeared in the summer of 1933 or 1934 , depending on what source you believe . A faction of Fard 's empire , those who considered Fard to be God , broke away from the Detroit Temple and set up shop in Chicago , where it has flourished ever since . The leader of this faction was and continues to be Elijah Muhammad , born Elijah Poole in Sandersville , Georgia , in 1897 . He has also been known at various times as Elijah Karriem , Gulam Bogans , Muhammad RassouIi , Elijah Muck Muhd , and Robert Poole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Fard , said to have been born in 1877 , will live until he is 444 years old and that he ? Fard , or Allah ? now resides in Mecca . The history of the Nation of Islam during the 1930s , 1940s and 1950s is distinguished by a number of characteristics . The highlight of the 1930s was its propensity for human sacrifices . One intrepid Muslim was reported to have erected an altar in his Detroit home in 1932 and convinced a boarder that he should present himself for human sacrifice so as to become " the Savior of the World . " At the appointed hour , and with great ceremony , the man plunged a knife into the volunteer 's heart . On another occasion , this same Muslim confessed to police that he had planned to sacrifice two  | women welfare workers , if only he could have found out where they lived . ' Sacrifices were still being performed as late as 1937 . One Muslim was arrested early that year as he prepared the ceremonial slaying of his wife and daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 1930s also witnessed the fragmentation of the nationalist movement . There was the Peace Movement of Ethiopia , still in existence , that urges Negroes to return to Africa . There was the Iron Defense League ( a uniformed group of black fascists ) , the Pacific Movement of the Western World , an organization called " The Development of Our Own , " all of which sympathized with the Japanese during World War II . There was then the short-lived National Movement for the Establishment of the 49th State and later such sects as the Joint Council of Reparation ( a back-toAfrica group that was at one time willing to work with Rockwell 's American Nazi Party ) , the Garvey Clubs , the United African Nationalist Movement , the Jamaican-based Ras Tafarians ( a small , marijuana-smoking cult whose members have murdered at least six persons ; this group takes its name and derives its inspiration from Emperor Haile Selassie , who was born Ras Tafari Makonnen ) , the Royal Ethiopian Jews , the Washington Park Forum , the American Economic League and a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslims were in jail for , among other things , refusing to register for the draft , sedition and conspiracy . Elijah Muhammad himself was arrested in 1942 and sent to jail until 1946 . The Nation of Islam leader and many of his followers sympathized with the Japanese during the war , claiming close kinship to the non-white Orientals . " Great Japanese victories leave few victims for us , " Muhammad was quoted as saying at the time . Apparently imprisonment of its leader did not destroy the Nation ; in fact , it continued to grow , most recruits coming from federal prisons . In the 1950s , the movement began to expand rapidly , primarily footnote The Nation of Islam has been the object of a number of take-over bids . In 1932 , the Communist Party made a bid ; later one was made by a group of Japanese who wanted the Muslims to swear allegiance to the Mikado ; and still later a bid was made by an Ethiopian group led by one Wyxzewixard S. J. Challaoueliziczese . More recently , another group of Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them have been successful .  | because of the messianic qualities of Muhammad 's second-incommand , Minister Malcolm X. Its growth was helped by the concurrent migration of Negroes from the countryside into the cities . Virtually all Nation of Islam Temples are located in cities where there is a sizable Negro population . Today it has been estimated that members exceed 100,000 in number . That , as one observer put it , is more people than Billy Graham has converted . Elijah Muhammad , like Fard , is a light-skinned Negro with an Oriental profile . He is of small stature , rather fragile-looking and suffers from high blood pressure , bronchitis and asthma . The seventh of twelve children , he worked at a variety of menial jobs before coming to Detroit in 1929 , where he was subsequently converted to Islam by Fard . He admits to having no formal education and no working knowledge of Arabic . He works hard , however , has a retiring manner ( except when he speaks of whites ) , wears an embroidered fez , conservatively cuts suits , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has six sons , two daughters and over two dozen grandchildren , all of whom , until recently , were in the movement . Elijah is revered by his followers as the Messenger of Allah , as the Prophet , as the Divine Leader , the Savior Allah , and Our Deliverer . Every Muslim , with gushing praise , attributes all his own words , actions and thoughts to " the Honorable Prophet , Elijah Muhammad . " Elijah himself seems a little embarrassed by the praise . If W. D. Fard is the Nation of Islam 's Jesus Christ , then Elijah Muhammad would be its St. Paul . He has the unsettling habit of saying , during one of his rare public appearances , in response to a reporter 's query : " . . . And how do I know that ? . . . Because Allah told me . " He never raises his voice , never seems unsure of himself . On occasion he will vary the format with : " Ah , but you see . . . I did n't say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites seems to have no limits . " The white man is more vicious , " he said , " than the dogs he sets upon us . He is never satisfied with a black man no matter what his position . You can lie down and let your back be his doormat , but soon he 'll get tired of that and start kicking you . Turn over ,  | nigger ! You 're layin ' on the same side too long , ' he 'll say . " On another occasion he wrote : The slave-masters ' every cry is to beat ? beat ? kill ? kill ? the so-called Negroes . Maybe the day has arrived that Allah will return to the devils . . . that which they have been so anxious to pour on the poor innocent so-called Negroes . Allah will give you your own blood to drink like water and your arms and allies will not help you against him . . . . America is now under Divine Plagues . One will come after the other until she is destroyed . Allah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite topic of Muhammad 's . Every natural or man-made disaster is played up in his newspaper as the beginning of the end : sandstorms , floods , hurricanes , airplane crashes , shipping disasters . The winter of 1966 was held to be an augury of things to come . Of all devils , the Jews are the object of the most concerted criticism by Muslims . In fact , most poor Negroes feel a deep hostility toward Jews because , as so often is the case , Jews own many of the stores in Negro areas . They are therefore the most " visible " of whites . This is particularly true in Harlem and Watts . It was no coincidence that the Negro rioters in both areas turned their wrath on the Jewish stores first . Harlem 's term for all Jews , " Goldberg , " is only slightly less derogatory in meaning than " Whitey , " " The Man " and " Mr. Charlie . " Blazing anti-Semitism will often be the motivating force behind a person joining the Nation of Islam . Elijah Muhammad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Malcolm X , often was more candid and undoubtedly reflected the feelings of many other Muslims . The latter said in an interview in Playboy magazine : Make a true observation about the Jews , and if it does n't pat him on the back , then he uses his grip on the mass media to label you an anti-Semite . . . . The Jew is always anxious to advise the black man . . . . But the Jew that 's advising the Negro joins the NAACP , CORE , the Urban League and others . With money  | donations the Jew gains control , then he sends the black man doing all this wading-in , boring-in , even burying-in ? everything but buying-in . . . . No , when there 's something worth owning , the Jews got it . . . Whatever Elijah Muhammad chooses to castigate ? the Negro middle class , the civil rights movement , or all whites everywhere ? his faithful lap it up with a seemingly insatiable appetite . Malcolm X writes in his Autobiography of Muhammad giving a speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white man has not got it in him to find the human decency , and enough sense of justice , to recognize us , and accept us , the black people who have done so much for him , as fellow human beings ! " " YAH , Man ! " . . . " Um-huh ! " " Teach , Messenger ! " . . . " Yoh ! " . . . " Tell ' em ! " . . . " You right ! " . . . " Take your time up there , little Messenger ! " . . . " Oh , yes ! " The goals of Muhammad 's Nation are not clear ; in fact , they seem intentionally vague . But if they are not baldly stated , they are at least implied , and no Muslim is under any illusions about them . First , Muslims seek a worldwide hegemony of black peoples ; and all non-whites are considered black . They realize that only through strength will they be heeded . White fear of black unity , they add , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek racial and economic separation . In his book , Message to the Blackman in America , Muhammad writes : We must stop relying upon the white man to care for us . We must become an independent people . So-called Negroes should : 1 . Separate yourselves from the " slave-master. " 2 . Pool your resources , education and qualifications for independence . 3 . Stop forcing yourselves into places where you are not wanted . 4 . Make your own neighborhood a decent place to live . 5 . Rid yourselves of the lust of wine and drink and learn to love self and your kind before loving others . 6 . Unite to create a future for yourself . 7 . Build your own homes , schools , hospitals and factories .  | 8 . Do not seek to mix your blood through racial integration . 9 . Stop buying expensive cars , fine clothes and shoes before being able to live in a fine home . 10 . Spend your money among yourselves . 11 . Build an economic system among yourselves . 12 . Protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one demand qualifies it as a political group . Where precisely this land is , no one within the movement has ever stated . The chances that any specific site will ever be named are remote . There is some speculation that Muhammad would prefer some land in the Southwest ( this may be due to his living in Phoenix , Arizona , most of the year because of his asthma ) ; others seem to think he is considering some foreign land . Malcolm X , in 1960 , before he broke with Muhammad , suggested that American Negroes be subsidized by the federal government for their " 300 years without a pay day " : The United States can subsidize Israel to start a state ? Israel has n't fought for this country . The United States can subsidize India and Latin America ? and they tell Americans to " go home ! " We even subsidize Poland and Yugoslavia and those are communist countries ! Why ca n't the Black Man in America have a piece of land with technical help and money to get his own nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought , died and helped to build this country , and since we ca n't be citizens here , then help us to build a nation of our own . We do n't have to go to Africa . We can do it right here.5 He was once specific enough to say that he thought " nine or ten states would be enough " but he would expand the point no further . There are others who believe that Muhammad expects to acquire his land only on the day of judgment . At that time the prevailing order of things will be reversed , and if any whites are still alive they will be shipped back to Europe so that the Black Nation can rule America in peace . Muhammad can profit handsomely from the fact that his organization is considered primarily a religion . Without fear of being  | accused of sedition , he can talk about " the judgment day , " the " Battle of Armageddon , " holocausts , trials by fire , the devils , believers , unbelievers , the " battle in the sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Muhammad runs an exceedingly tight ship . He is absolute boss , there are no elections , he makes all the important appointments , his word is law . He demands absolute obedience from his followers ; any infraction is severely dealt with . A Muslim must not drink , smoke , swear , lie , steal , gossip or gamble . He must not commit adultery , nor socialize with Christians , nor fornicate , nor conk his hair , nor use skin bleachers , nor show disrespect to his ministers , nor carry any weapon . He must maintain a high standard of personal hygiene ; he must dress conservatively , keep his home tidy , pray five times a day facing Mecca and eat only one daily meal . He must not vote in elections nor otherwise take part in public life . He must not salute the American flag nor may he join the military . Otherwise he should obey all laws . If he has a job outside the Mosque , he should do a fair day 's work for his pay . The Muslim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his Christian " slave name . " Eventually , if he is a good Muslim , he is given his " original " name ? Ali , Karriem , Shabazz , Muhammad , and Sharrieff are the most common ? which Elijah is supposed to learn directly from Allah . " Why should we Africans carry our slavemasters ' names ? " asked Malcolm X once . " Did you ever see a European white man calling himself Kasavubu ? " Food a Muslim does not eat includes black-eyed peas , collard greens , pinto beans , cornbread , rabbit , possum , squirrel , coon , carp , catfish and sucker fish . The one absolutely taboo food is pork , which Muhammad claims has 999 specific germs and is actually one-third rat , one-third cat and one-third dog . A Muslim can be suspended indefinitely from the Nation if caught eating it . Muhammad keeps his followers very busy within the fold ; in fact , he insists that all Muslims spend a maximum amount of time at the Temple . This helps to build up loyalty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contribute a certain percent-  | age of his income to the organization , which sometimes runs as high as 33 percent , with special lump-sum assessments for occasions such as Savior 's Day ( February 26 ) . If a Muslim is not out hawking his quota of the sect 's newspaper , Muhammad Speaks ( circulation approximately 200,000 ) , he may be out " fishing " in the ghetto for new members . Or he may be collecting green stamps for a new school bus , or he may be attending classes at the University of Islam ( most of which are accredited ) , or he may be helping in the office with correspondence , inserting yellow sheets of paper into each envelope " to keep the letter from being read by infra-red cameras , " or advising correspondents not to put a return address on their envelopes . The chances are good , however , that he will spend considerable time working in one of the Muslim enterprises , all run on a hardnosed capitalist basis . In Chicago , for instance , the Muslims own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a restaurant ( where the food is described as " Soo Deelicious " ) , a realty company , a radio and TV repair shop , a dry cleaning business and some apartment buildings . They own a 140-acre farm in Michigan . There is also an eighteen-room mansion and a fleet of expensive cars which must be kept in top condition in order to maintain Elijah Muhammad in the manner to which he has become accustomed . If you are a female Muslim , the chances are you spend your time in the Muslim Girls ' Training and General Civilization Class , which is a leadership group dedicated to teaching the female converts their proper role in life . All MGTGCCs wear a white nunlike habit and shun all beauty aids ? lipstick , rouge , nail polish , etc . If you are a physically large male and show unusual zeal and dedication to the Nation of Islam , you may be chosen to join the Fruit of Islam , a tough , fanatical , secret elite that comprises the inner core of the movement . Fruits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nation , maintaining a standard of Muslim excellence that all followers would gladly emulate . They are both admired and feared by the rank-and-file Muslims . Fruit , so the analogy goes , is the final product of any tree ; yet , fruit provides  | the seed for the next tree . The FOI see themselves as the fruit of the old tree ( slavery ) and the seed to the next ( the Black Nation ) . The Supreme Captain of the FOI is Raymond Sharrieff , Elijah 's son-in-law and perhaps the second or third most powerful man in the movement . He is a stocky man , always neatly dressed , with a baleful glare who , like most other Muslims , does not talk to whites . New FOIs , once chosen , are given rigorous training . This includes judo , military drill , the use of knives , blackjacks and small arms . They are also taught such techniques as how to incapacitate a police horse and how to kill a police dog ( grab its leash and whirl the animal around your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , secret oath . Apparently the FO1 keep small arsenals , pending the battle of Armageddon , but the caches are not supposed to be as big as they were in the I 930s . No FOI arms himself in public . In any event , there is no need to be armed because , as one observer put it , the FOI are trained to do without arms what a cook can do with potatoes ? mash , slice and fry . The major functions of the FOI are security and discipline . Whenever a rule is broken , the accused goes before the FOI for judgment . Whatever decision is handed down ? fine , suspension , beating , expulsion ? is final ; there is no appeal . What happens when an FOI steps out of line is less clear , although there are some indications that the ultimate penalty is death . FOls are purportedly prepared to lay down their lives under a number of circumstances , three of them being : an assault on a black woman , an invasion of the Temple , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOI before entering the Temple , members and guests alike . Un-Muslim items such as tobacco , dope , razors and miscellaneous hardware are confiscated until the person leaves . The Fruit of Islam also provides Elijah Muhammad and his ministers with a corps of bodyguards . Muhammad 's personal set of janissaries is a phalanx of the most intimidating-looking FOI imaginable ? rugged six-footers all with stony expressions . Whenever Muhammad makes one of his rare public appearances he is  | escorted into the room by perhaps thirty of his FOI . He is not even visible ; his guards bunch around him like artichoke leaves . When this moving mass of Muslims reaches the appointed spot , the phalanx parts and out pops Elijah Muhammad , blinking like an owl in the sun . The bulk of Muslim recruits are drawn from what A. Philip Randolph calls those " lowest down on the totempole . " They are the ones who have been hurt the worst by whites , both mentally and physically ; they are the ones who feel most alienated from society . They are the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and the ones who have lost contact with their church . When a Muslim goes " fishing " for recruits , he goes to the center of the ghetto , where the pimps , winos , hustlers , addicts , criminals and bums congregate . One of the most famous of Muslim recruits was Malcolm X , the man who built the Nation of Islam into what it is today . Malcolm was born Malcolm Little in Omaha , Nebraska , in 1925 . When he was four years old , the Black Legion , a local Klan-like group , burned his parents ' house down because his father was " uppity . " Before he was seven years old his father was run over by a streetcar . When he was fourteen he moved from Michigan to Boston to live with his sister , Ella Mae Collins . From a selfconfessed " hick , " Malcolm soon turned " cool " and " hip , " a " stud " and a " cat " with a zoot suit , knob-toed , orange-colored " kick-up " shoes and conked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends ( and later as " the Harlem Asp " ) , he was successively a shoeshine boy , a Lindyhopper , and a sandwich vendor on the Yankee Clipper running between Boston and New York . Within a year of his moving to Boston he settled in Harlem , where he was a waiter in Small 's footnote To conk hair , according to Malcolm , thin slice a potato into a Mason jar , pour in half a can of lye ; add two eggs and stir rapidly with a wooden spoon . This " jelly-like , starchy-looking glop , " as Malcolm called it , is then spread all over your scalp . Apparently this mixture burns ; but the longer the pain can be endured the longer the hair will remain straight . Relief is achieved by washing the solution off with water . In his Autobiography , Malcolm complained that he conked his hair once in the men 's room on a train , but when he went to wash off the scorching " congolene , " as it is also called , he found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to stick my head into the stool and flush and flush to rinse out the stuff .
