Evening . A darkened room . Figures huddle close together . There is a sudden flash , a great white ball of light . Then a wavy line . Then a dot . Then nothing . <P> " I feel like someone is dead . " <P> The occasion is not an atomic disaster , but the breakdown of the family television set in prime time . The pitiful line about someone being dead was actually spoken to an interviewer on television viewing habits , along with such others as , " I nearly lost my mind . The days were so long , " and " It was terrible . We did nothing . My husband and I talked . " <P> Americans take their viewing so seriously that more than one-fourth have their set repaired or replaced within four hours ; about half get it going again within a day ; and almost no one can bear to miss Mister Ed for more than a week . <P> Jusl-Like a Woman . So says a new book , The People Look at Television , by Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on two surveys financed by CBS , TV 's most prosperous network ( its 1962 profit was equal to that of NBC and ABC combined ) . The people interviewed ( 2,500 in the U.S. at large , 300 in Manhattan ) somehow seem to show a three-to-one preference for CBS shows . <P> Some of the book 's more intriguing findings concern the " average " American viewer . He has no more than a high-school education , an annual income of less than $8,000 , and accounts for more than three-quarters of all television homes . His opinion of TV ranges from " extreme , unqualified " positive ( " I love it-it moves me just like a woman " ) to " extreme , unqualified " negative ( " It comes from the devil " ) . On the whole , though , he thinks it 's just fine , at least as Psychologist Steiner interprets him . <P> Moreover , the highly educated seem to share this glad acceptance to a remarkable degree . But the better-educated viewer says he likes serious programs much more often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of school never watch heavy drama , while 11% of the most educated go for the Ibsen-substitutes when available . While only 5% of the grade-school audience are interested in information and public affairs , 13% of the college group and 23% of postgraduates declare that they like it best . <P> To Tell the Truth . Can the testimony of these college types be trusted ? Not according to Steiner . He is convinced that what they say they see is very different from what , behind closed doors and with interviewers out of the living room , they actually watch . Checking their viewing records in an ARB rating , he discovers that the only kind of program they choose considerably more often than the average man is heavy drama . During the evening hours , they spend only 4% less time watching " light entertainment " shows than grade-school addicts , only 2% more time watching news , only 1% more time watching public affairs shows . To Steiner , the difference among educational groups lies " not in what they do , but how they feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or FCC Chairman Newt Minow , selects the same programs and spends as much prime time in front of his set as the kids from Kenosha , Wis . But Newton Minow-or so this survey implies-feels worse about it .
