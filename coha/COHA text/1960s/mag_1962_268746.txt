The rain fell in chill , drenching drops . Yet more than half of the 648 citizens of Mariposa , a tiny town in central California , turned up on the county fairgrounds for breakfast with the Republican candidate for Governor . And Richard Nixon , in a soggy grey suit , explained the purpose of his visit in the simplest possible terms : " I need your votes . " Thus , last week , Nixon began his formal campaign for Governor with a four-day , 1,900-mile swing through eleven of California 's 58 counties . Six times before , he had presented himself to California 's voters-for the U.S. House of Representatives , the Senate , Vice Presidency and Presidency . Six times they had endorsed him . In 1962 Nixon is very well aware of the fact that his whole political future depends on a winning campaign for Governor-and that he will need every single vote he can find to defeat Incumbent Democratic Governor Edmund G. ( " Pat " ) Brown . <P> Only four months ago , California polls showed Nixon comfortably ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a " Mr. California , " the nonpartisan presiding officer of a progressive , prosperous state . Only occasionally has he struck out at Nixon as a " prospector from the Potomac , trying to acquire a grubstake to get him and his family back to the East Coast . " And the polls now indicate that Brown has drawn nearly even with Nixon . <P> It was in the face of that situation that Nixon hit the campaign trail last week-and no town was too small for his attention . He spoke in a bar in Mokelumne Hill ( pop . 502 ) , in a hotel lobby in Jackson ( pop . 2,500 ) . He strolled the board sidewalks of Columbia ( pop . 300 ) , where High Noon was filmed . He pumped hands along the main street in Sonora ( pop . 4,000 ) . " Howdy , " he said to everyone he met . " Thank you for coming out to say hello . " In Yuba City ( pop . 13,000 ) , a man told him : " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Replied Nixon : " Thank you . I would never carry this state if it were n't for Democrats like you . " At Coulterville ( pop . 115 ) , a voter said : " I 'm a Democrat , but I saw you on the Jack Paar show and I 'm going to vote for you . " Later TV Star Nixon chuckled to reporters : " See , it was worth it . I picked up one vote . " At Live Oak ( pop . 3,000 ) , townspeople gathered around Nixon , and the ensuing conversation was typical of his entire campaign week : Lady : I was sick for three months when you lost to Kennedy . <P> Nixon : Well , go out and work a little harder this time . <P> Second Lady : You 're a great man , and you 're going to save us . <P> Nixon : Thank you . I need your help . <P> Man : I 'm for you , Dick . <P> Nixon : Keep slugging . Very good to see you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate ) : My whole family is for you . <P> Nixon : It 's great to have a family and look so young . <P> So it went . Perhaps they were all Republicans anyhow , but at least they were n't being lulled by a Democrat campaigning as " Mr. California . "
