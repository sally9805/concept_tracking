INFECTIOUS DISEASES <P> Spring 1964 is the best of times for a German measles party . The rules call for lots of kissing games in an unventilated room , so that all the little boys and , more especially , all the little girls get the infection . It is consistently so mild an inconvenience that for children of both sexes it is best to have it and get it over with ; one bout generally confers lifelong immunity . There is just one vital precaution . No infected child should be allowed anywhere near a woman who is-or even may be-in the first three months of pregnancy ; if she has escaped the disease in childhood , the virus may cause blindness or crippling heart defects in the fetus . <P> Grandma Was Right . Last week tens of thousands of Americans had German measles , and the vast majority had caught it willy-nilly without the fun of a party . " It comes in waves , two to four years apart , " said Chicago 's Health Commissioner Samuel Andelman . " When it starts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spread from New England , down the Eastern seaboard and westward to the Continental Divide . It has not yet hit the West Coast in full force . It will . <P> Grandma had the best name for the disease : " threeday measles . " * The usual symptoms are a mild sore throat , a light rash , and a fever of not more than 102 . In children , some swelling of the lymph glands is common but is usually not severe . Only rarely does the virus of three-day measles lead to pneumonia or brain inflammation . But it may occasionally be fatal . Last week three children 's deaths associated with the current epidemic had been reported from Chicago , and a Connecticut teen-ager had died of encephalitis . Less predictable and less understood is a complication among adults : pain in the joints , sometimes so severe that it is compared with that of rheumatoid arthritis , though it lasts only three to seven days . <P> Rationed Shots . Researchers are checking to make sure that the rubella virus has not mutated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no evidence that this has happened . <P> Though work on a vaccine is being pushed , none can be ready this year . Last week came a hint that German measles may be one of the first virus diseases to yield , at least partially , to drug treatment . University of Michigan researchers told the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology that amantadine , a drug synthesized by Du Pont chemists , works against German measles virus in the test tube . And it is safe enough to have been used with promising results on influenza patients . Such a drug may help children , but proving its safety for pregnant women will take years . <P> If a woman who is pregnant , or thinks she may be , is exposed to German measles , she should get a shot of gamma globulin . Many state and city health departments offer it free in such cases . The precious blood fraction is now in such demand that some states are rationing their supply , limiting it to women who know they are pregnant . <P> <P> *The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be especially common in Germany . The medical term , rubella , is bad because it invites confusion with rubeola , the true " red " or " seven-day " measles .
