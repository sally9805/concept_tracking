txt What 's ahead . American labor intends to quicken its lobbying pace this year in 22 statehouses . Last year legislative hoppers in 47 states and Puerto Rico overflowed with some 6,000 labor-linked bills . More than 700 of them passed , many impacting substantially on la bor . Gavels will call 22 state legislatures to order this year . And labor lobbyists probably will be on hand at every one . In New York , the AFL-CIO will try to lift the state 's minimum wage from $1.25 to $2 . Last year Gov . Nelson A. Rockefeller irked labor when he vetoed a hike to $1.50 . Lobbyists will press for a $2 minimum in New Jersey , too , but would probably settle for $1.50 and broader coverage . And in Massachusetts , the AFL-CIO will try to put jobless pay on a sliding scaleup to two-thirds of regular pay . The maximum is now $50 a week . Rail unions on two sides of the Atlantic are trying to put a crisis on the track . Britain 's Labor government has just re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter hours . And now the union threatens to strike on Feb. 14 . In the United States , the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen is bent on restoration of half of the 17,500 firemen jobs , which were lopped off by arbitration . The arbitration award expires March 31 . But the railroads say they wo n't restore a single job . The fight will touch 190 carriers , but it will zero in largely on six major railroads . The industry does n't expect a strike , since the union is too weak ? and too alone . It calls the union threat " a pseudo-strike . " Besides , if a real crisis did develop the Railway Labor Act would bar a strike for most of 1966 . Trends . ? ? American labor may not be static , but its strike statistics seem to be . Last year there were more walkouts than the year before . But they involved fewer workers and caused about the same amount of lost time . For the sixth straight year lost time ratios hovered low ? at least low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 10,000 were lost in 1965 . Through the ' fifties , 32 were lost out of every 10,000 . The longshoremen 's strike along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts was the big upheaval of 1965 . A holdover from the year before , it accounted for almost one-fourth of 1965 's 23 million man-days of strike idleness . With fewer big-labor contracts to negotiate this year , there will probably be still fewer strikes and more static statistics . 0 The narrow ledge that joblessness clings to in most industrialized nations of the world grew even narrower last year . Italy , with a slight dip in employment , was perhaps the only major exception . Everywhere else , unemployment generally fell . The International Labor Organization now says joblessness has ceased being a serious problem  --  except for certain workers , especially older ones . Unemployment rates around Europe often kept well under the American level  --  which at last look stood at 4.1 percent and will probably drop below 4 percent this quarter . In some nations , joblessness fell below 1 percent of the labor force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In West Germany , for each jobless worker there were more than eight vacant jobs . The picture in the developing nations , however , is just the reverse . Desperate unemployment still prevails . How and why ? . ? A grumbling noise is rising from the working ranks . Many American workers are miffed over the smaller paychecks they are taking home since the bigger deductions for social security and medicare took hold Jan. 1 . The dent in the paycheck deepened by 4.2 percent on the first $6,600 of annual earnings . Unions say " some pressure " is building now for more pay to offset the added tax . The steel industry is in real trouble : There may be women in the furnace room . New federal laws and the 1965 labor contracts , prohibit discrimination in mills because of sex . That means that a " man 's industry " might have to take in women . And that worries ' everybody because the cold steel plants , in particular , are n't designed to have women workers around .
