 | Why Not Pamper Your Husband ? A few weeks ago I flew to a Midwestern city , where I had been invited to make a speech . Afterward , a sweet young woman came up to me , looking very hesitant and shy . " Dr. Brothers , " she whispered , " I just ca n't mention this to anyone else , and I wonder if you would help me .... " " If I can , " I replied , drawing her aside and expecting to hear something slightly shocking . . . . " Well , " she said , " it 's like this ... . Ted and I have been married for almost a year . He 's a lawyer ? just brilliant and has a wonderful personality . Everybody says he 'll be in Congress before you know it . But there 's something I 've discovered that bothers me terribly . He 's so , well , gullible in some ways . He 's so easy to influence it makes me wonder if something 's wrong . I can usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart on if I flatter him a little , or bribe him with his favorite dessert . ... " " So ? what 's the problem ? " I asked . " That 's the problem . Is n't a husband supposed to be the boss ? I ca n't figure out if my Ted is a little weakminded , or if all married men are like that . " Few women are willing to put this feeling into words , but many of us wonder to ourselves . It does sometimes seem that husbands are entirely too susceptible to sweet-talk and certain kinds of superficial pampering . And men also seem too bothered by its absence . A colleague of mine , an outstanding marriage counselor , tells me that one of the most frequent causes of infidelity in husbands is the feeling of being unappreciated at home . It 's difficult , he admits , to convince an intelligent , attractive and hard-working wife that a dash of extra solicitude can restore her @# But other species are more dependent . Their reasons for flocking and herding together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick are emotional as well as practical . Man is possibly the most dependent creature of all . Scientists say it is genetically built into human beings to want to lean on one another all through life . A. well-adjusted person should be capable of total independence in an emergency , but he should n't be expected to savor it . The selfsufficient hermit is psychologically peculiar ! In earlier and simpler societies , when people worked together co-operatively , they could count on any number of friends for help and support . But , in the modern world , all that has changed ? especially for men . Most of our husbands must he on their own , lonely and guarded all day long . Even if your man is unusually lucky and has a job which involves teamwork , how much can he depend on his fellow workers in this cutthroat day and age ? I think that the everyday burden of live-or-die competition which almost every man in America must live with is really quite frightening . For a solo businessman or professional man like Ted ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the daily round is especially rough . When he 's on the job , he literally has no moment to put his feet up or ( more important ) to let his hair down . After a frantic day of fighting for survival ( in rush-hour traffic , at lunch counters , even at his desk where every decision represents a possibly disastrous mistake ) , it 's no wonder that when he comes home at night a warm smile and a waiting snack carry so much weight . Home , to Ted , is where continued on page 32 happy marriage . But , very often , this strategy works . Let 's see why . No one ? man or woman ? feels perfectly grown-up and capable all of the time . All of us , if we could admit it , feel some need to lean on someone sometimes , to be coddled and pampered ? loved unconditionally the way a small child wants to be loved . ( This might be why Gershwin 's Someone to Watch Over Me is still a favorite . ) Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit like a mother or father to them . When a husband or wife fails to convey some of this " watching over you " feeling his spouse may feel disillusioned and betrayed . Sometimes he even " falls out of love . " Is this normal ? Definitely . And it 's nothing to be ashamed of . Some animals ? felines , for example ? are loners by nature . Only their young crave looking after and emotional tenderness . If you 've ever owned a cat , you know that by the time he 's full-grown he 's magnificently on his own .  | he refuels for tomorrow by sometimes retreating to a temporary state of little-boyishness . Home is where , at long last , there 's someone to look after him , to sympathize , to mother him a little . And what 's so wrong about that ? Does it make your husband less of a man , or you less of a woman , for you to provide the kind of tenderness and help , encouragement and gentleness that are associated with the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm all for it . ( I 'm also all for husbands providing wives with a kind of fathering ? a topic I 'm going to talk about next month . ) When it comes to ways and means of pampering a husband , what I have in mind is coddling him now and again , going out of your way to be affectionate and caring , taking a little extra trouble to starch his shirts exactly the way he likes them , giving his tired muscles a gentle rubdown , or baking him one whale of a chocolate cake . These small but symbolic extras often are enough to give him the wonderful feeling that you care for him in a womanly way . . . . Incidentally , they are also a means to the end of his forgiving you your shortcomings when you yourself are under par . Let me tell you about two brothers I know quite well , and the story of their marriages . Lloyd married Cynthia , a bright and efficient girl . To be painfully honest , Cynthia is the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely , and she did it on a song . Her four sons always seem clean , courteous and well cared for . She herself looks as though she stepped out of a bandbox , even at nine in the morning . She 's been a great boon to her husband 's career , and has even managed to find time for a part-time career of her own , as a magazine illustrator . Lloyd 's brother Jeffrey married Thalia , a girl of Italian descent . In the ways that show , I suppose Thalia ca n't hold a candle to Cynthia . She certainly is n't as efficient , and she does n't look as chic . At times she gets overemotional and makes scenes . But , in the true Italian tradition , Thalia loves to cook for her husband . She 's been known to spend the whole day in the kitchen preparing a special delicacy just for him . Furthermore , she 's always fussing over his health . If Jeffrey has the slighted sniffle , she insists that he stay at home and rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat from her husband . On the same occasion . Cynthia got a no-nonsense set of steak knives . ( If you 're bridling at my using an Italian " mamma " to make my point , I want you to know that I do it advisedly . In America today , there is little doubt that Italian ( and Jewish ) wives are most freely showered with gifts and appreciation . I believe this is linked to the way women raised in these two cultural traditions are likely to pamper their husbands . Lasagna ? or chicken soup with homemade noodles ? served up with a large dose of motherly sympathy , appear to pay high marital dividends . . . ) Anyone who follows my column knows that I 'm not an advocate of play acting or insincerity in any aspect of life . I do n't believe you should pretend to admire your husband more than you really do , or make a fuss over him when you think it 's silly . But pampering is not the same thing as play acting , and honest appreciation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm urging is that you come to terms with the fact that every husband ? and that includes yours ? wants and deserves a bit of mothering from his wife , even though he wo n't ask for it . Once a loving wife understands this , the rest follows naturally . For example . she feels indulgent , rather than angry , when her husband seems jealous of a new baby . She cheerfully waits on him , even for a mildly upset stomach . When she must criticize. she goes about it with the same careful tact she has learned to practice on her six-year-old son . She refrains from sarcasm about the money he 's wasted on tools for do-ityourself repair jobs that have to be done over . . . . None of this amounts to a terribly tall order . Most husbands are far easier to please than their wives imagine . Husbands want to be loved more than they want glamour , a perfect home or brilliant parties . Our men are n't simple-minded ; they 're just very , very human .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
