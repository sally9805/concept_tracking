" After the 1960 campaign , " Richard Nixon recalled last week , " Jack Kennedy and I got together for a post mortem . We agreed that while people usually judge a candidate by the number of miles he covers and the number of hands he shakes , that kind of campaign is madness . With modern communications , it is also a waste of time . " <P> Nixon learned other lessons from his joust with John Kennedy , and he is cannily applying them to his primary battles against Michigan 's George Romney . The former Vice President 's campaign to date in New Hampshire and Wisconsin has been relaxed and understated , designed to encourage the image of Nixon as statesman . Ironically , Nixon believes that in the popular memory he has somehow acquired a Kennedyesque patina simply because they opposed each other in 1960 . He is right about some of the patina , of course : he has a new TV makeup man . <P> Like John Kennedy , Nixon refuses to kiss babies or wear funny hats on the campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at street corner and factory gate , Nixon is deliberately restricting himself to broad policy speeches , delivered with a new urbanity and self-effacing if slightly forced humor , before sizable crowds . For unlike Romney , Nixon is almost too well known . After eight years with Eisenhower , his loss to Kennedy , and his disastrous defeat by Pat Brown in California , he knows he must avoid seeming stale-and a loser-in the voters ' minds . <P> Racial Gaffe . Last week , as the candidates passed the midway point in the New Hampshire primary campaign ending on March 12 , Nixon continued campaigning at a stately pace . He delivered two speeches in Wisconsin , scene of the nation 's second primary , then returned to the Granite State for several weekend appearances with his wife Pat , Daughters Julie , 19 , and Tricia , 21 , and Julie 's 19-year-old fianc , David Eisenhower . <P> Only once did Nixon lose his footing . In Rhinelander , Wis. , a TV interviewer asked him about Viet Nam . " This country can not tolerate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no respect for human lives . They do n't care about body counts . " The implicit racial slur invited attack , particularly against a candidate advocating vigorous prosecution of the war . <P> Still , a Gallup poll last week showed Nixon the choice of 51% of G.O.P. voters , followed by New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefeller ( 25% ) and California 's Governor Ronald Reagan ( 8% ) . Romney was in fourth place with 7% . Another Gallup rated Nixon even , 42 to 42 , with President Johnson among all the nation 's voters .
