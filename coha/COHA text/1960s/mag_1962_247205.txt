NINE out of ten of our readers get TIME in the mail , but reader No. 10 picks it up at the newsstand . Our newsstand sales naturally vary with the temper of the news , as well as the seasons . Some complicated events draw readers to us , who want to have it all spelled out in one comprehensive story . <P> Those weeks our newsstand sales go up , even though we might have someone else-a movie star or a novelist-on the cover . Other weeks it is the cover that seems to be the draw . And often , of course , cover subject , newsi-ness and public interest happily coincide . Such was the case with the recent Billie Sol Estes cover . The newsstand interest in this spectacular Texas bankrupt , added to the rising number of regular TIME subscribers , combined to make that issue our alltime leader in circulation , with 2,784,000 copies . <P> THAT figure does n't count another 705,000 copies of our five international editions . Those copies , in English and predominantly air-sped , are identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advertising . In Latin America we add four pages of regional news , and in Canada four pages of Canadian news . <P> Those Canadian pages are currently jumping , with a national election on . We now print in Montreal ( 288,000 copies a week ) and recently established a satellite editorial staff there , headed by Canadian John Scott , to write and edit our Canadian coverage right on the scene . This week they are doing something unique in TIME 'S history : putting out a cover story of their own . Their issue , of course , contains the complete Nelson Rockefeller cover story . But the cover is a specially drawn Canadian political cartoon ( see cut ) straight out of A Midsummer Night 's Dream . Canada 's leading cartoonist , Duncan MacPherson , aware that the summer Shakespearean season at Stratford , Ontario , coincided with the June 18 national election , put his Prime Minister John Diefenbaker ( center ) and Liberal Opponent Lester Pearson ( holding the lion ) in the motley of a couple of Shakespearean comics . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge by Canada 's latest Gallup poll , is a risky business . <P> OUR regular cover is of a man who in his daily life is surrounded by art , whether it be the Currier and Ives in his office , the U.S. historical paintings in the Governor 's Mansion in Albany , or his own immensely valuable collection of more than 1,000 paintings . Since his taste runs to the modern and not to the old masters , his collection favors bursts of color and form , not portraits . And he is not much for having himself painted . Only once before , during World War II , when all the brothers got themselves painted , did he sit . This time , he posed for seven hours for TIME Artist Henry Koerner . He likes the finished painting , but Nelson Rockefeller is not one to enjoy holding one position for a long time . " I feel like a sphinx , " he protested to Koerner.
