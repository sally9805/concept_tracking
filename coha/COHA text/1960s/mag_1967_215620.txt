The large , high-ceiling conference hall of Caracas ' Palacio Blanco was crowded last week with newsmen and television crews . The government had hurriedly called a very unusual press conference . On display were two members of Fidel Castro 's Cuban army : Manuel Gil Castellanos , 25 , and Pedro Cabrera Torres , 29 . Blinking in the glare of klieg lights , the Cubans were escorted into the room , one after the other , were briefly questioned by government information officers , and were then led away to a military prison . <P> The two were part of a twelve-man landing squad-four Cuban military and eight Venezuelans-that had completed terrorist training in Cuba and been sent to link up with the 200 or 300 guerrillas holed up in the Venezuelan Andes . Early last week the squad slid by night over the side of a Cuban sailing bark off the Venezuelan coast near Machurucuto , 70 miles east of Caracas , and started toward shore in two rafts . In the surf , one raft capsized , drowning one of the Cubans . Finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army , which hunted down the invaders before they could escape into the mountains . In a sharp fire fight , the Cuban commander of the contingent was killed , and two men were captured - the first uniformed Cuban army men that the Venezuelans have ever nabbed . <P> The Venezuelan episode was a blatant example of the way Fidel Castro is attempting to export his revolution to other Latin American countries . Though he so far has met with little real success , there has been in recent weeks a notice able increase in Castro-inspired terrorism throughout the hemisphere : <P> &gt; In Bolivia , a band of 100 or so Castroite guerrillas is active . The government got the first hint of their existence a few weeks ago when an army patrol ran into an artfully concealed ambush in a mountainous area 350 miles southeast of La Paz , lost seven men . A subsequent army sweep turned up a recently deserted training area complete with field hospital , bakery , and other clues of the Cuban presence . Bolivia 's President Rene Barrientos ordered a Ranger battalion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed ten guerrillas and captured ten , including a 26-year-old Frenchman named Jules Regis Debray , who studied guerrilla warfare under Castro and organized the Bolivian band . Last week , armed with a pistol , rifle and grenades , Barrientos himself joined the guerrilla hunters . <P> <P> &gt;In Colombia some 300 Castroite guerrillas in two main bands roam the countryside . In recent weeks they hijacked a train , killed 15 army troopers in an ambush in mountainous Huila province and shot to death six more in an attack on an army convoy near Chaparral , 115 miles southwest of Bogota . <P> &gt; In Guatemala the situation has , by contrast , remained fairly quiet-though at least 250 Castroite terrorists still roam the country 's interior . Their attacks are , however , a far cry from the kidnapings and bomb-throwings that nearly panicked the country last year . One reason : the guerrillas have lacked a leader since Luis Turcios Lima died at 24 in an auto accident last October . New President Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro has combined an army drive to hunt down guerrillas with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebel cause by making life a little less unpleasant in the harsh backlands.
