( See Cover ) Shed no nostalgic tears for New port . The great " Gilded Age " of the early 1900s - when O.H.P . Belmont 's carriage horses used to sleep on pure white linen sheets , and William Fahnestock festooned the trees on his estate with 14-carat gold artificial fruits-has passed . But Rhode Island 's " Queen of Resorts " still has its cachet and its names : the Auchinclosses , the Dukes , the Donahues , the Drexels , Lorillards , Woolworths and Hartfords . <P> <P> Mrs. Margaret Van Alen Bruguiere , the summer colony 's grande dame , still lives in her 50-room " cottage , " Wake-hurst , surrounded by a fortune in art and a dozen servants . Bailey 's Beach , where the memberships pass from father to son , is still " the most exclusive swimming hole in the U.S. " In the Newport Casino , ladies still sip tea under parasols , while their husbands , decked out in white flannels and old school blazers , watch the tennis matches . And at nightfall , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White Elephant Ball , the Jazz Festival , plus a progression of wedding receptions and black-tie soirees in honor of anything and anyone , provided that he ranks somewhere up there with a U.S. Senator or a European count . <P> Yet the real lion of Newport society this summer , the most talked-about and sought-after visitor in town , the guest without whose presence no party can truly be called a success , is a normally gregarious fellow named Emil Mosbacher Jr . Unfortunately , Mr. Mosbacher regrets . His appointment book is full . He is dating a lady named Intrepid , and she is a most demanding mistress . <P> <P> She gets him up at 6:30 every morning , sends him to bed exhausted at 11 every night . She has given him sunburn , windburn and heartburn , great anxiety , occasional despair , and the kind of gut satisfaction that makes it all worthwhile . Sometime within the next two weeks , unless every sailing expert has lost his bearings , the commodore of the New York Yacht Club will come alongside Intrepid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have the honor to inform you that Intrepid has been selected to defend the America 's Cup against the Australians in a match starting Sept. 12 . Congratulations . " <P> The Way to Go . " Ships are but boards , " Shakespeare wrote , " sailors but men . " He was obviously a landlubber . Never in U.S. history have so many men gone down to the sea ( or lake , or river ) in ships ( or boats ) - and whether they sail a 13-ft . Blue Jay or a 70-ft. offshore racer , they are a breed apart . West Coast fanatics get their kicks out of racing dinky , 8-ft . El Toros around treacherous San Francisco Bay , where a 20-knot wind is just air conditioning . Wintertime " frostbite " racing in tiny dinghies ( 6ft. to 14-ft. cockleshells with sails ) is all the rage on the Great Lakes : " I was dunked three times last winter , " boasts a gleeful Chicagoan . In last June 's gale-tossed Annapolis-to-Newport race , 91 boats started and only 55 finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know of men who have died during races at the age of 70 , " says Champion Star-Class Racer Bill Parks , 45 , of Chicago . " It 's the way they probably would have wanted to go . "
