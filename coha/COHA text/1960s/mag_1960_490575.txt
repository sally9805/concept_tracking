Notes and Comment MAYOR WAGNER made an arresting public announcement on New Year 's Eve , when hard-1 anybody but the Times was paying close attention to what anybody else said . His exact words were " Each new year brings new challenges to all of us , and I assure you that as your Chief Executive I am rededicating myself and our administration to see that these challenges are met quickly and efficiently . " We would like very much to attend the rededication ceremony . There has been a wide variety of City Hall ceremonies under Tammany 's benevolence , ranging all the way from beauty contests , at which jimmy Walker dedicated himself to a task requiring sober detachment , down to the laying of cornerstone after cornerstone by O'Brien , who always exhibited an appealing unfamiliarity with pick , shovel , and bulldozer . It can not help but be fascinating to go downtown and see what kind of stage has been arranged for Wagner 's rededication ceremony . The word alone is interesting . It has a rickety status in the dictionary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any number of words uttered from public platforms or in front of television cameras today have no status at all with the lexicographers . The word " normalcy " got into Webster 's only after it had undergone common usage by Harding , who played around with it in the White House . Paradoxically , though , " normalcy " appears to have been abandoned by present-day public . speakers , possibly because the speakers feel that their employment of it might indicate that they had an unseemly interest in oil . As for " dedication , " those who nurtured the roots of that word for sacred purposes were under the impression that it was something a man does once , and once only . They made no provision under which dignitaries of either church or state could dedicate themselves to a principle and then , on discovering that they had exhausted their ammunition in the wrong direction , could simply draw hack , turn around , reload , and have another go at their aspirations as thousands cheered their miraculous rebirth . " Rededicate " is a word that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was properly qualified to put to effective use . He was mystical , political , unprincipled , and eloquent . In the days when Father Divine was talking to the impoverished multitudes of Harlem , men who wanted to get into City Hall , or who were in there and hoping to leave it gracefully before they were engulfed by their shortcomings , listened with a show of respect . They publicly , applauded everything Father Divine said . They did that because they were after the votes of his followers . When Father Divine would leap up on the banquet table that had been provided by the earnings and savings of these followers , and explode with a statement such as " Peace ! It 's wonderful ! It is tangible , it is retangible , and it will he reretangibleated and will continue to rematerialize and repersonify and be reretangibleated , " it was enough to make anybody 's hair stand on end . There was a man who could rededicate . Fiddlers A SMALL room on the twelfth floor of a building on ? Vest Forty-second Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to coast . Marvellously cram-jammed with silken bombshells , golden pails in which to catch coins raining out of heaven , artificial roses that bloom all the more furiously for being picked , and empty glass howls that glitter with living fish at the merest flick of a wand , this tiny arcanum is officially known as Lou Tannen 's Magic Shop . Amateur magicians , and even clumsy-fingered laymen looking for tricks to play at home are gladly suffered , but the shop is also for pros , and the pros forgather there as much to gossip and , as they say , " fuddle " one another as to buy equipment . This is all right with the proprietor , Mr. Tanncn , who is no mean fuddler himself . Having been in magic for thirty-four years , he is the easy master of his merchandise . In the shop , however , he reserves the right to he a trifle careless , and on the occasion of a recent visit we made to his aerie we caught the red-haired , red-mustached , red-freckled fuddle r red-handed , sewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my customers before you talk to me ! " he commanded us , and darted into a secret recess at the back of the room . Obeying orders , we joined a group around a man who was solemnly changing one-dollar hills into fives . Our arrival prompted a flurry of competitive performances . " Pick a card ! Pick a card ! " said a willowy wizard named Ken Krenzel , spreading a deck before us . We picked what only we knew to he the two of clubs , and , at Krenzcl 's request , restored it to the deck . After a four-way one-handed cut , a one-handed shuffle , and a two-handed under-thebridge shuffle , the two of clubs suddenly fluttered to the floor , and the rest of the group nodded approval . Next , a man who introduced himself as Frank Garcia , cardsharp detective , invited us to inspect the four aces in a deck he was holding and to think hard about one of them . We thought hard about the ace of spades as Garcia executed a series of passes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other and to cascade over his shoulders , and shuffled them six times with one hand ; he then uttered an incantation , thumped the deck with his fist , and presto ! ? there on top was our ace of spades . " He fuddles us all with that one , " Krenzel said . Among those present at Tannen 's that day was Thomas K. Hawbecker , national president of the Society of American Magicians , who told us that professional magicians have found the going pretty rough ever since vaudeville died but that magic itself is flourishing , thanks to TV , night clubs , and a great increase in the number of skilled amateurs . Many of the new tricks of the trade , he said , are being concocted by inventive geniuses among the amateurs . As for the Society that he heads , it was founded by Houdini and some other magicians back in 1901 ) , and has two thousand members , all of whom have passed a necromantic entrance examination . The Society is dedicated to the propagation of magic and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricks are performed may become a member , and any member who falls by the wayside and gives away a trick may he promptly expelled . Mr. Hawbccker was good enough to pass us on to Mr. Jack London , the well-known authority on the art of picking pockets . In the very act of meeting us , Mr. London contrived  --  entirely without our knowledge  --  to relieve us of our wallet and watch . " The public must keep an eye out for spitting cannons , fob workers , moll buzzers , hanger bingers , and lush workers , " he said , returning our possessions . " Spitting cannons sneeze on you , in order to scruff you . Scruffing is pushing up an object  --  a wallet , say  --  from the outside of a garment . Fob workers specialize in lifting loose change out of side pockets ; moll buzzers and hanger bingers specialize in ladies ' handbags ; and lush workers , who are n't much respected by the rest of the trade , specialize in rolling drunks . If you see a man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chances are he 's a dip at work , with his hand on somebody 's wallet but unable to crook his elbow sufficiently to lift it out . Pickpockets usually travel in packs of three  --  one to push , one to pick , and one to conceal the act from passersby . " Mr. Garcia had come up in time to hear London 's last words , and he put in that cardsharps usually travel in packs of four : a mechanic , who deals ; a cutter , who cuts ; a shill , who peeks ; and a muscle boy , who smothers ( roughs up ) any rabbit ( sucker ) who catches on . " A good mechanic can control every card in the pack , " Garcia said , handing us a deck to shuffle . When we had thoroughly shuffled it , he dealt us , seriatim , a royal flush and a full house . Garcia and London , who earn their livings by lecturing and giving demonstrations of the pitfalls that await unwary cardplayers and pedestrians , are exceedingly skillful at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tannen , who bounced into sight behind Garcia and , with a snap of his fingers , caused a paper bouquet to materialize under our nose . " We stock over twelve thousand items in this shop , " he said . " A fourth of them we manufacture ourselves . We do n't stock really big items , like the Substitution Trunk , the Floating-Girl Illusion , and the Improved Sword-Box Mystery , because we have n't the space , but we 're glad to make them to order . If you 'd like a machine for cutting people in half , I can have it for you within two months . The hack-saw model sells for three hundred and seventy-five dollars ; the buzz-saw one costs nine hundred and ninety-five . " Tannen said that while he does n't invent new tricks , he spends a lot of time embellishing old ones . " Lately , I 've been working on that old trick where you put a balloon in a box , stick pins through the box , then extract the balloon as full of air as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magician has n't been able to show the inside of the box to his audience ; now I think I 've fixed it so he can . I daresay I 've a bigger hag of tricks than any other magician around , maybe because I demonstrate every item I sell . " Here Tannen casually caused five lighted cigarettes to appear in his clenched fists . " A good magician must possess a sense of melodrama and a talent for misdirection , " he went on . " The difference between good magic and bad is the difference between a mere puzzle and entertainment . " He conjured a small cup out of thin air . The cup was obviously empty , but a moment later it disgorged a golf ball , a squash hall , and three tennis halls . " That 's what I mean by misdirection , " Tannen said . " Fud-dled ? " We admitted we were fuddled , and invited Tannen to lunch . " Sorry , " he said , " I 'm on a light diet , " and out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulbs . ?

WHITE II , the new editor and new president of the Herald Tribune , is a tall , rangy , blue-eyed , dark-haired , craggily handsome man of forty-four who was born and reared in Mexico , Missouri , a town of fifteen thousand pop . one hundred and ten miles west of St. Louis . The other day , we interviewed him in his office , a big , cream-colored room dominated by a portrait of the late J. White-law Reid , where he greeted us with crinkly cordiality , settled back in his swivel chair , and put his feet on his desk . " I recently bought a two-hundred-year-old house in Rye , " he said when we asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night just after we moved in , as I was unpacking , it sort of pleased me to come across an old , rusty , battered flintlock that originally came from Southampton , Long Island , where my ancestors , who 'd landed in Massachusetts from England in the sixteen-twenties , moved in 1640 . My great-grandfather , who was born in Southampton and went to Amherst , moved to Missouri and took along the flintlock , which had been used in the Revolutionary Var . I do n't know why he moved to Missouri . He just packed up his wife and three sons  --  the middle one of them became my grandfather , Colonel Robert M. White  --  and took off . In 1876 , when my grandfather was twenty-one , he acquired the Mexico Ledger , which had been established in 1855 . He and his brothers were vigorous specimens . I have three favorite stories about six-guns and the White rothers . " We asked him to tell them , and he shifted his feet from the left side of his desk to the right side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wearing six-guns , so his two brothers took theirs off . Then , one day , the youngest , Albert , got in a fight with two men in a saloon . He knocked one down , and while he was taking on the second , the first man shot him in the back . When Albert died , the town expected my grandfather to either kill the man who shot Albert or leave town . He did neither . Instead , he ran another editorial against carrying six-guns and called Albert 's murderer a coward . So then it was up to the killer to either shoot my grandfather or leave town . He left town . " This struck us as a rather zestful story , and we said so . " When I was a lad around the Ledger office , " Mr. W. continued , " a paper salesman , Billy Adams , the kind of man who was called a drummer then , told roe he 'd never forget one day when he came to solicit an order From my grandfather . The Colonel had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' and he was backing a man down the stairs . Colonel White was six feet two , and the man he was pushing downstairs was small , and I could n't understand this bullying action until I saw that the small man had a six-gun in your grandfather 's " The Colonel 's namesake smiled . " Doubtless an outraged subscriber , " he added , and proceeded to his third family anecdote . " The oldest brother , Nate , was in the cattle business in Texas , " he said , " and got into an operation with the Dalton boys , the famous gunmen . At a roundup run by Frank Dalton , he said , Frank , you damn fool , anyone could run a roundup better than you . ' Well , later , as he was leaving in his buggy , Frank drew tip en horseback with both guns drawn and said , ' White , nobody talks to a Dalton the way you talked to me . You are either going to apologize or he buried right here . ' Dalton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a White never apologizes , but I may have said something I did n't mean . ' Want a Coke ? " Mr. White unwound himself , went into an adjoining room , and came hack with two Cokes . We asked him about his father . " He 's seventy  --  oh , gosh , I think he 's seventy-eight  --  and he and I are co-publishers and were coeditors of the Mexico Ledger . He took over after the First World War and I took over after the Second World War . He 's crazy about the circus ! ' White Ps , we learned as we swigged our Coke , attended Missouri Military Academy , West Point , and then Washington and Lee , where he played halfback and graduated in 1938 . " I got an honor appointment at West Point and flunked out after six months because I was bad at math , " he said . " I went on the paper after college , and have owned it for the past ten years or so . I wrote mast of its editorials . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago , when I was at a newspaper convention in San Diego and Barney Kilgore got to talking about it . We tried to figure out what we 'd do if we had it . Bernard Kilgore , that is  --  the president of the Wall Street Journal . He 's also a director of the Whitney Communications Corporation , which is principally owned by jock Whitney and has a controlling interest in the Tribune . Last April , Barney again talked to me about the Tribune . That led to a discussion of the possibility of my editing it and to my talking with Jock Whitney about the possibility . I have a deep and abiding respect for newspapers  --  I think they 're the most important things on earth  --  and I found that Whitney is the kind of guy who puts a newspaper ahead of the ownership , which is the only way a newspaper can be great . " Mr. White is a Democrat , and Mr. Whitney and the Herald Tribune are Republican , but he said that his acceptance of Whitney 's offer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The two really exciting things I 've found here are the tradition of this paper , expressed in terms of reader loyalty to it , and staff loyalty , period , " he said . " I was aware of this tradition but not the extent of it . I 've written two editorials so far  --  an accounting to our readers when I came in , at the beginning of August , and one , in September , addressed to Mr. Khrushchev . We ran it on the first page , in Russian as well as in English . I felt the paper would reach the Chairman himself  --  a number of our subscriptions go into the Kremlin  --  and / tried to make the point that the important thing about our wealth is what produces it . What kind of system makes it possible for a printer to have a power lawnmower if he wants one ? I rewrote it twice and showed it to two of our staff men  --  Everett Walker , the Sunday editor , and L. L. Engelking , the acting editor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening paragraph . I 'd originally started off with poverty ( Khrushchev knows the meaning of poverty ; he actually knows the meaning of starvation ) , but this was a negative approach , and it 's always wrong to be negative ! ' Mr. White served on General Eichelberger 's and General 11/lacArth or 's staffs during the war , winding up as a lieutenant colonel . He commutes from Rye , where he has installed his wife , Barbara , the daughter of a Muncie , Indiana , manufacturing family ; their three girls ( Barbara , ten ; Jane , nine ; and Laura , four ) ; and the family dog , Sam , a black Labrador retriever . " There 's wonderful quail shooting in Missouri , " he said , " but I do n't know what I 'll do about that here .

More Light THE Hayden Planetarium was closed shortly after New Year 's , and will remain closed until the end of the month , to allow time for the installation of a new firmament . The old projector at the Hayden  --  a Zeiss Planetarium Projector , Model II  --  had been faithfully turning out uncounted skyfuls of stars , planets , comets , sunrises , and sunsets ever since 1935 , when the Planetarium opened , and now , being fairly well worn out , it has been traded in for a late Model III , which has so many up-to-th e-minute refinements that the Zeiss people prefer to think of it as a very early Model IV . Needless to say , we have been up to West Eighty-first Street to catch a glimpse of the labors involved in a change of firmaments , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new projector by Joseph M. Chamberlain , the young head of the 27 Hayden . Mr. Chamberlain , whom we found ankle-deep in excelsior and obscure machine parts , prevailed on us to seat ourself on an adjacent packing case less , we suspect , for the sake of our comfort than to keep us from inadvertently stepping on any of the precious lenses that lay scattered about under the great dome . Model III was already reaching heavenward , like some huge , victorious insect , while its apparent adversary , poor old Model II , lay lifeless athwart a dismembered chassis . Four technicians , specially imported by Zeiss from its plant in West Germany , were tinkering with the new projector , and Mr. Chamberlain regarded them with admiration . " They 're working around the dock , " he said " It takes experts to assemble these machines In some ways , manmade firmaments are more intricate than the real thing . " Man-made firmaments also wear out much faster than the real thing . Model II was being replaced , Chamberlain told us , because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it had grown slightly dotty . " A few years back , it started playing all sorts of queer tricks on us , like making the planets jump about in their retrograde loops through the stars , " he said . " Finally , we opened it up and discovered that it had , in effect , the organs of a ninety-year-old man . Some of its bronze gears wobbled and gave off the dickens of a noise , and the copper plates in which the stars were punched were so corroded that the tiny star holes had clogged up , causing the stars to shrink and their light to fail . Luckily , we 're getting not only a new machine but one with a number of major improvements -- -chiefly more light , more speed , and a wider range of action . All the eighty-nine hundred stars and planets in our heavens will be brighter ; we 'll be able to roll through the heavenly movements of a whole year in four minutes flat ; and among the new motions we can depict are the progression of the mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual parallactic swing of Sirius . " Seeing that these new motions had us buffaloed , Chamberlain eased us off the packing case and over to the control panel , where he introduced us to Mr. Thomas D. Nicholson , an astron omer of the Hayden and a veteran of some twenty-five hundred Planetarium Lectures . " Gives you a sense of power , does n't it ? " Mr. Nicholson asked as our fingers played over knobs labelled " Meteor Shower , " " Nova , " and " Aurora . " " If you want a dawn , pushing the Sunrise knob is n't enough . You have to remember to push Blue Light East as well , and then the Sun . And it takes six knobs to work a full-scale aurora . " To prove his point , Nicholson started pushing one knob after another , but the projector was , of course , disconnected , and all that resulted was a sudden shower of sparks . A technician leaped out from behind the panel and gave Nicholson a hurt look , and we thought it best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lens that he said would produce the moon ? " a better-focussed moon , a more serene moon than we 've ever had . " He went on , " Another improvement we 're making is in the seats . We 're installing new plush theatre seats , which will be a lot more comfortable than our old black wooden ones . Still another improvement is the removal of our Manhattan skyline , which had been fixed to the dome from the day the Planetarium opened and had become sadly out of date . Besides , it spoiled things when we tried to create the illusion of , say , a Pacific island . Now we 've placed projectors at fourteen points around the room and can create any number of skylines  --  New York by night or day , Rome , the North Pole , the hills of Galilee . At our opening show , on January 30th , I plan to shoot the works . We 'll start off with a blazing sunset , maybe throw in an aurora or two , gallop through a couple of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display of comets or a nice dark eclipse . " We left Chamberlain musing there , assorted heavens wheeling before his eyes and the moon in his hand .
