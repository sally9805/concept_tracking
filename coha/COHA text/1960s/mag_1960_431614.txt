 | How Birds Find Their Way in the Sky @# MEN peering through field telescopes at the bright face of October 's full moon have occasionally caught glimpses of an eternal marvel not more than 3,000 feet above their heads . That shining disk has spotlighted for them a small portion , of the stupendous southward flights of birds that take place every year at this season . Watchers have counted as many as 9,000 birds an hour streaming past the moon . From that tiny illuminated sampling they have estimated that in the same hour hundreds of thousands of travelers were winging south . Few of us ever see this spectacular show . That 's because most of it takes place in the dark . Be they bluebird or bobolink , robin or wren , most migrant birds favor flying between eight p.m. and midnight , and between four and six in the morning . Celestial navigation . How birds perform their twice-a-year feats of long-distance night flying has mystified men for ages . The explanation used to be that they have a " marvelous sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific enough to suit scientists . Besides , radar has demonstrated that when birds run into heavy clouds or fog , they can lose their sense of direction and mill about in confusion . But now a 35-year-old German scientist from the University of Freiburg thinks he has the answer . After careful study of European warblers , Dr. E. G. F. Sauer puts forward the astonishing theory that these birds navigate by the stars . He concludes that they ( and other @#  | night flyers ) are born with an instinctive knowledge of a map of the stars , plus the ability to relate it precisely to the season and to where they are on earth . Birds can navigate by the sun , too . During the past 10 years , English and German scientists have proved that homing pigeons and starlings relate the sun 's slowly changing position in the sky to the direction where they want to go . Daytime migrants can plot their course this way , as can night birds , resting or foraging for food . " Flyways . " While European scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered another navigation question : Do birds flock to a few major routes once they know where they 're going ? ? Are there highways in the sky ? Yes , says Frederick C. Lincoln of the U. S. Fish &; Wildlife Service . In 1935 , after long study of banding data , he identified four major " flyways " for birds @# @#  | in this hemisphere . He named them the Atlantic ( coastal ) , Mississippi , Central ( eastern slope of the Rockies ) , and Pacific ( coastal ) Flyways . Traffic is heaviest on the Mississippi flyway . Many of its millions of travelers , including the tiny ruby-throated hummingbird , push on across the Gulf of Mexico to Central America and beyond . Other distance travelers include the barn swallow , who winters in Brazil ; the bobolink , who hops from Florida to Cuba to Jamaica to Venezuela and parts south ; IN POPULAR SCIENCE OCTOBER 1960 and the Atlantic golden plover , who flies nonstop from Nova Scotia to northern South America , covering 2,400 miles in 48 hours ( an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in Argentina . But the greatest long-distance flyer of them all is the Arctic tern . This bird breeds as far north as feasible , and then migrates almost to the bottom of the world for the winter . It covers at least 25,000 miles in its round trips . What sets them moving ? People used to think it was nippy weather that drove birds south . Experts now know that the reason is more complex . Some birds leave northern points as early as mid-July . Others hang around until there 's snow on the ground . Chickadees never leave at all . In general , those . with the longest journeys make the earliest departures . But for the most part , the migration timetable depends on the food supply . As the days shorten , there are fewer hours in which to find edibles . As the temperature drops , summer insects begin to die off or hibernate . This , not chilliness. starts insect-eating birds on their way to tropical lands . The seed-eaters soon follow , though some wait until the first snowstorm buries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeds entirely in trees , where there 's usually something to eat all year . No " togetherness . " Food is more important than sex at fall migration time . Few males and females travel together . Ducks are an exception . They take the whole family along , instinctively flying in V formation . With a wise old drake out in front , this makes it easier to keep tabs on everyone . Parents of perching birds drive their youngsters from the nests as soon as they can fly . The small fry , smarting with resentment , get together and fly south by themselves , ahead of the old folks . The frivolous female phalarope heads south as soon as she has laid her eggs . She leaves her mate to hatch them , take care of the young , and follow her whenever he can break away from his tedious domestic round . Steady as they go . While the southward trek allows no dawdling , birds do n't break any speed records , either .

Air tragedy . On such a night in September , 1948 , thousands of birds crashed into New York 's Empire State Building . Their bodies rained on neighboring roofs and streets for six hours . That same night , flocks smashed into a lofty Philadelphia building and fell to the sidewalk - so thickly that people could n't step there . A similar catastrophe was occurring in Baltimore . Over wide stretches of water , on the other hand , flocks of little land birds have been seen flying at a height of only 200 feet . Sandpipers travel hundreds of miles barely clearing the waves . This man's-eye view of the bird world was clouded for thousands of years . Scholars often wondered where their feathered , friends went in the fall , but the answers that occurred to them were odd indeed .

The eternal return . As spring spreads northward from the equator , they all follow it , driven by the old biological urge to breed . Back they go over the same flyways , making the same stopovers , and , miraculously , often returning to exactly the same spot where they spent the previous summer . It 's a sad commentary on marital fidelity among birds , though , that rarely do both mates come back to the scene of last year 's liaison .
