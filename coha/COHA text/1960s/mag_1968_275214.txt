COVER STORY <P> Verrry Interesting . . . but Wild <P> Richard Nixon ? Making jokes on a TV comedy show with a bunch of weirdos ? You bet , as they say , your sweet bippy . Everybody and his myna bird wants to make a cameo appearance on Rowan and Martin 's manic Monday night affair . It is the smartest , freshest show on television . President Johnson , Igor Stravinsky and Jean-Paul Sartre have not yet appeared at the stage door , but if they do , they 'll just have to get in line behind Marcel Marceau , Bing Crosby , Pat Boone , Dick Gregory and Jack Benny . And they will do anything once they get before a camera . Marceau in future programs will perform pantomime bits , but most of the other guests will utter senseless non sequiturs , or the reigning catch phrase of the moment , such as " irky perky ! " and " Sock it to me ! " Sammy Davis Jr. , who last season turned his here-come-de-Judge antics into a rollicking miniballet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the kids trail after him squealing the phrase in chorus . It would be only moderately surprising if next week J. Edgar Hoover popped onto the screen and said , " Here come de Judge ! " * <P> Laugh-In was last season 's biggest TV hit , and is already a solid Nielsen winner so far this year . But that alone would hardly be enough to draw such a motley assortment of celebrities to the show for $210 per appearance . What appeals is the program 's extraordinary ambiance : it has an artful spontaneity , a kind of controlled insanity , emerging from a cascade of crazy cartoon ideas . In yet another TV season of pale copies , Laugh-In is unique . It features no swiveling chorus lines , no tuxedoed crooners . Just those quick flashes of visual and verbal comedy , tumbling pell-mell from the opening straight through the commercials till the NBC peacock turns tail . Often the first-time viewer can hardly believe the proceedings . Silly punch lines fly like birdshot . Childish name games produce outrageous amalgams of sound : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'd be Shirley Black Power . " <P> " If Jan Sterling had married Phil Silvers , divorced him and married Robert Service , she 'd be Jan Sterling Silvers Service , " <P> There are graffiti : <P> FOREST FIRES PREVENT BEARS <P> THIS IS YOUR SLUM KEEP IT CLEAN <P> JACKIE GLEASON TAKES SILICONE <P> There are off-color , high-school-caliber homilies : <P> " The snake that striketh at the jeet of the hunter is naught but a pain in the grass . " <P> Absurd definitions : <P> " A myth is an effeminate moth . " <P> And sniggering questions : <P> " Truman Capote : Man or Myth ? " <P> Public Notices : <P> LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE CALL THE EYE BANK <P> GEORGE WALLACE YOUR SHEETS ARE READY <P> Fresh one-liners : <P> Spy : " It is n't that I wanted to work for the CIA , but I still have family in Washington . " <P> Unbelievable two-liners : <P> Man : " How can I believe you , Elizabeth ? That child does n't even look like me ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , stupid ! " <P> Ancient three-liners : <P> He : " I 've heard plenty about your lovemaking . " <P> She : " Oh , it 's nothing . " <P> He : " That 's what I heard . " <P> And passable four-liners :
