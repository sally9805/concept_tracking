txt This rich suburban community , which has no poor children in its schools , is applying for $33,551.13 in Federal- antipoverty funds to tutor the town 's slow learners . The town probably will get the money because a rigid statistical formula approved by Federal and state education officials says a community the size of Garden City , where the median annual family income is about $14 , - 000 , should have 91.70 economically deprived children . Not one was found in a diligent search conducted by school officials here , but ? they decided to apply for the antipoverty money anyway because , said Oliver Melchior , Superintendent of Schools , " Our judgment was that this money is available , all of it money which all of us as taxpayers have contributed . " Garden City , as it is legally entitled to do , asked for the money under Title I of the Federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 , after being informed by the State Education Department that the funds would be available . The funds are allocated on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families- earning less than $2,000 a. year . Mr. Melchior said he was " surprised " when he learned that the funds would be available . He said the money would be used for children in kindergarten through the third grade who had " learning problems " and " who are not doing as well in class as their schoolmates . " " We will hire remedial teachers and medical specialists , including neurologists and behavioral scientists , whatever appears to be necessary , to get at the bottom of what these kids ' difficulties are , " he said . No Families to Fit When school officials looked into the community recently they could find no youngsters ' whose families fit into the income pattern under which the district would be entitled to education funds . Garden City is a tree-lined community of stately homes , some of them Victorian structures , 19 miles from New York City . In 1965 it had a population of 24,304 , most of whom lived in single-family homes with a median value of $30,500 . The remainder live in well-appointed apartment houses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $90,000 to $125,000 . The community ranks 13th in annual median income in Nassau County . Eighty per cent of its residents are white-collar workers . Mr. Melchior said that he and his colleagues used Federal and state guidelines in applying for the funds and would " resent Garden City being used as the whipping boy if people want to take pot shots at the Education Act . " A planning supervisor for the Department of Education said that Garden City was not the only wealthy community . in New York State to have applied for and received funds . " There are all kinds of inequities under the program , " the supervisor , Richard Schilling , said . " This situation exists in other areas . But if Garden City does n't spend the money no other district can get it . They are n't taking anybody 's money . If they do n't spend it , it goes back to the Federal Government . " We grant that districts are ending up with allocations that wo n't go to economically deprived youngsters . If there is no ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money can bb geared to the educationally deprived . " Data Hard to Determine Mr. Schilling said that it was virtually impossible to go into every school district in the state to determine the number of ! families receiving welfare aid lor earning $2,000 or less annually . " We decided to use the sampling technique as the most ' equitable way of distributing ! the funds , " he said . That such sampling techniques can come up with strange figures is shown not only by the school case but also by a report by the Nassau County ! Planning Commission that Gar ! den City has a nonwhite population of 0.7 persons . Mr. Schilling said that the allocation of funds had posed a continuing problem for the state because it was based on " spurious data " supplied by the Federal Government . " We were told by the Federal Government that it was our responsibility to take the 1960 census figures and allocate the funds to all the school districts in the state , " he said . A spokesman for the Office of Education in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using faulty data . " " From time to time we have had situations called to our attention , where wealthy communities have applied for funds , " said David Phillips , program director for the Northeast . " This is the way it is . " Asked whether the funds should have been made available to Garden City , after the determination that there were no economically deprived youngsters , Mr. Phillips said : " It is a proper question to raise .
