Notes and Comment NOTE FOR NOMADS : A friend of ours who is just back from a motor trip to Miami Beach reports that on entering the restaurant of his motel there he found himself in the Shinto Temple Dining Room and was , furthermore , in plenty of time to take part in its Western Barbecue Nite . " H ATHAWAY pays a penalty for making this drip-dry shirt , " an advertisement in a recent issue of this very magazine says , under a photograph of our old friend Baron George Wrangel in a tasty blue-and-green patterned number , and goes on : Hathaway 's cutters have several bees in their bonnets . One is that they insist that all patterns should match perfectly across the huttan-panel  --  and also around the packets . This poses a frightful problem when the print is as big as it is in our photograph . Every seam must be matched by hand . And far-more cloth has to he cut and wasted . Our treasurer says it costs us an extra yard per shirt . Such is the penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty different patterns . For store names , write C. F. Hathaway , Waterville , Maine .

This is n't precisely the kind of wastage that Mr. Vance Packard has in mind in " The Waste Makers , " but it reminds us of the hook and of a chat we had about its subject , obsolescence , with a well-travelled man we ran into at a bar the other afternoon . " It 's less of a problem in the Congo than it is here , " he said after declining our offer of an Old-Fashioned as nut being newfangled enough for him . " Many Congolese think that locomotives are panting spints , and panting spirits never obsolesce . " New Exchange " L WRENCE H.

" In our experience , few ladies exhibit financial curiosity beyond the personal , so we thought this sample deserved a reply . We got in touch with Mr. Taylor on the phone and asked why he wants his own stock exchange . " It 's the public 's stock exchange , " he said , and invited us to lunch with him at the Canadian Club , in the Waldorf . " I 'm not a Canadian , " he said when we had both seated ourselves in the club dining room . " I was born in New York and brought up here and in Greenwich . This club takes in a number of Americans as associate members . Well , those of us in back of the new exchange got our charter from the S.E.C. last August , and we hope to open it within the next few months .

But these indexes are not rigid . An iron foundry would have to have a large fixed investment in the way of equipment ; a scientific company might have less , " Mr. Taylor , a brown-eyed , brown-suited man of forty-seven , went on to report , in answer to some questions , that he was an only child , the son of the late George Vanderbilt Taylor , who was an independent broker in the bulk-oil business ; that while taking night courses at Columbia he had gone to work for the Bankers Commercial Corporation ; and that in 1941 , after serving in managerial posts for it here and in Chicago , he had become a vice-president of its New York subsidiary , the Aviation Funding Corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That was a pretty active business before the Second World War . " During the war , Mr. T. was pretty active himself , moving up , via destroyer duty and aviation-specialist activities , from ensign in Naval Intelligence to lieutenant commander in the Office of Naval Research . In 1946 , he joined a management-consultant firm , Charles H. Welling &; Co. , for which he made studies of industrial diversification ? " how to assist a company in broadening its general base of operations , " as he expla.ined it  --  and a year later he moved his own base of operations to Lippincott &; Margulies , industrial designers , on whose behalf he flew a hundred thousand miles a year . " Too much travel , " he said . " In 1950 , I became a partner in Sirota &; Co. , commodity brokers  --  a position that I still hold . " In this capacity , he travels from Munson , where he lives with his wife and two children , to 26 Broadway . He informed us that his firm handles potato futures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , we trade in Maine-grown potatoes on the Ncw York Mercantile Exchange , " he replied . " Also in Long Islands , though they 're not as active . " " Pretend that we 're a customer , " we said . " There are different delivery months , " he said . " You might decide to buy March futures now . You have to buy at least a carload  --  fifty thousand pounds , in fifty-pound sacks . Today , a carload would he worth around twelve hundred dollars , but on margin you can buy a contract for two hundred dollars . If you do n't sell your contract by March , you then have a carload of Maine potatoes in the Harlem River yards . " " Suppose we do n't want them , " we said . " Suppose we 're just speculating in potatoes . " Mr. Taylor shuddered . " Suppose we 're an - investor , " we said . " Well , you can call a broker and sell them , " he said , and went on hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fries , and take actual delivery . On the other hand , you might prefer a different variety of potatoes in March . You might End that Pennsylvania potatoes chip better , if you 're a potato chipper . You could then have your broker switch you to those . " We asked what other futures he dealt in . " All sorts of commodities , such as copper , rubber , cotton , and cottonseed oil , " he said . " I was instrumental in starting the trading in platinum futures on the Mercantile Exchange . Platinum is inspected by an Exchange-approved assayer and stored for delivery by the Irving Trust .

Why a new stock exchange when New York already has two ? Well , some people like the idea of being listed on a small new exchange with companies of their own size and about the same trading activity . Subjective values are present .

Kindly signal an usher and you will be provided with a delicious lemon-flavored Vicks Vitamin C Cough Drop . " In a Second THEtelephone people have recently installed , in the little town of Morris , Illinois , the world 's first electronic central office , and are now assessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware for a production model , to be ready for installation throughout the country by 1965 . A duplicate of the Morris central office is to he found  --  we almost said " lives "  - -  - at the Bell Telephone Laboratories , across the river in Whippany , and to Whippany we 've been , to examine the marvel in person and try , with the help of a veritable campanile of Bell technicians , to understand something of its intricate , not quite indescribable workings . The two things that impressed us most about the electronic central office  --  it is known as ECO for short , and is nothing much to look at , seeming scarcely more than a commonplace assemblage of tall gray steel cabinets  --  are its fantastic speed and its no less fantastic ability to correct itself . Everything about ECO 's speed astonishes us even as we set it down ; italics form in our mind , and we find it hard to discard them unused . For ECO performs in mere millionths of a second the same switching operations that our conventional electromechanical systems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( A thousandth of a second is known as a millisecond ; a millionth of a second is microsecond . ) The fractions of time thus saved may strike us as infinitesimal , but to ECO they arc well-nigh infinite . Most of us think of a second as short ; to the men at Bell , it has come to seem extremely long . The twelve seconds that it takes the average person to dial a seven-digit number amount , in ECO 's terms , to an eon , in which millions upon millions of separate tasks can he successfully carried out . When you reflect on how much ECO can accomplish in a microsecond , and then reflect that there are more microseconds in a minute than there are minutes in a century- , ECO 's capacity for work assumes truly dazzling proportions . Before we start talking about ECO 's uncanny ability to correct itself  --  a quality that appeals to us because we 're optimistically inclined to consider it ECO 's most nearly human manifestation  --  we 'd better attempt to state what ECU is . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum of all that is contained in those tall gray cabinets : twelve thousand transistors , a hundred and six thousand diodes , twenty-three thousand neon-gas tubes , and tens of thousands of other electronic components . Altogether , this jungle of diverse equipment makes up a general-purpose switching system endowed with the basic functions of logic and memory necessary for solving data-processing problems . By routing orders that come to it in the form of electrical pulses , a central control directs the operation of line scanners , signal distributors , and a switching network . The central control is itself under control , being instructed at every stage in the completion of a telephone call by what amounts to a permanent memory , containing a program of instructions that is stored on four photographic plates in the form of two and a quarter million hits . ( Bits  --  a word derived from the phrase " binary digits " ? are coded dots , which are the equivalent of yes-or-no answers to pre-stated questions , and these hits are read off the photographic plates and translated into electrical pulses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate of twenty-five bits every few millionths of a second . ) Two so-called temporary memories , each capable of retaining 16,384 items of information , record the status of lines and dial pulses by " reading " and " writing " electrical charges that are beamed at a mica target . Prodigious are ECO 's innards , and prodigious is its performance . A highspeed scanning switch checks the condition  --  on or off  --  of each of a thousand telephone lines ten times a second . This condition is relayed through the central control unit to one or another of the temporary memories . When a customer picks tip his telephone to make a call , the scanner detects the presence of voltage and reports it to control , which knows from the record kept in the temporary memory that a tenth of a second ago the phone was peacefully in its cradle . If the temporary memory has no record of anyone 's trying to reach the customer 's line , control draws the conclusion that the customer wishes to originate a call . It orders the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space in the temporary memory to record the digits he will dial ; ascertains from the permanent memory the customer 's own number , the type of line  --  private , party , or coin  --  that he is using , and the class of service to which he is entitled ; and causes the scanner to speed up and look at the line a hundred times a second , in order to make sure that the dial pulses will be registered correctly . Since all this is accomplished in from ten to twenty microseconds , ECU has many precious microseconds left to devote to other tasks before the human slowpoke at the far end of the line contrives to coordinate mind and forefinger , and actually starts dialling . In Morris , ECO is hooked up alongside a conventional electromechanical system , and therefore executes only a small portion of the high jinks it 's capable of . What we say of ECU from this point on describes what it 's designed to do eventually , not what it does . A customer having started to make a call , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth between its memories , asking the temporary memory for the digits it has recorded and asking the permanent mentory for a translation of the digits into instructions . When three digits of a normal seven-digit number have been called , the permanent memory tells control , depending on whether the call is local or long-distance , what exchange or trunk line to look for . Control asks its temporary memory whether a line in this category is free , and if it is , orders a signal distributor to activate a relay , so that outpulsing mat begin . ( Outpulsing is sending out from central the number that Slowpoke has just sent in . ) Temporary memory records the outpulsing and informs control when it has been completed . Control then orders the switching network to give a ringing connection to the number being called and a ring-bark tone to the customer making the call . Elapsed time for a typical local connecting operation , from the cessation of dialling until the first ring : two to three thousandths of a second . Now for the self-correcting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning the moment they start making mistakes , but ECO must maintain service at all costs and is therefore designed to check up on itself constantly . Every microsecond of spare time is spent giving itself thorough physical examinations by means that have been set up for that very purpose in its permanent memory . This is possible because ECO , like Noah 's Ark , conies equipped with two of nearly everything  --  two central control units , two permanent memories , two pairs of temporary memories , and so on . All of these duplicate parts go chugging along until the instant ECO catches itself making some clumsy error in logic ; then the two central control units start setting each other a master problem , and the unit that proves unable to solve it is automatically switched off . Its twin thereupon not only takes up the burden of providing telephone service singlehanded but proceeds to carry out a closer questioning of the faulty unit . Once it has discovered where the trouble lies , the healthy unit prints out in code on a teletypewriter the exact cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly old-fashioned object , a human being , steps into the picture for the first time . NVhat we 've told you is the merest introduction to the wonders of ECO , but we think it had better suffice for the time being . Every word of it is true , though we ca n't say we believe it ; billions and billions of milliseconds will have to pass before we do . ? OVERHEARD on a Third Avenue bus , tweedy man to lady in furs : " I finally planted my hyacinth and tulip bulbs , my irises and sweet peas  --  all the flowers for next spring  --  and then they were promptly scratched up and eaten by the damned peacock . " Left Hand and Right THANKS to a friend in Paris , we 're in possession of two small volumes that were recently printed over there . One volume is entitled " Le President Nixon : La Nouvelle Vague a la Mai-son Blanche , " and the other volume is entitled " Le President Kennedy : La Nouvelle Vague a la Maison Blanche . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the entire edition of the first was ordered destroyed by its potential publishers , and the few copies that escaped destruction are already , so we understand , collectors ' items . The two books were written by the same man , at practically the same time . This enterprising follower of the Biblical injunction never to let your left hand know what your right hand is doing is Nicolas Chatelain , United States correspondent for Le Figaro , and in order to get the story of his double deed we telephoned him in Washington , where he has his headquarters , and begged the privilege of an interview the next time a wave , new or old , happened to wash him in our direction . That occasion arrived a few days ago , and we found ourself confronting a lean , rather professorial-looking man in his middle forties , who speaks English with an accent more Oxford than French , and who told us that he 'd had no particular difficulty in writing the books from diametrically opposed points of view . " It was like arguing both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - What was sometimes awkward was that , hurriedly switching from one manuscript to the other , I 'd become a trifle confused as to which set of thoughts I was supposed to be having  --  Republican thoughts or Democratic , Nixon 's or Kennedy 's . I 've lived in this country almost continuously for over ten years , I covered the 1952 , 1956 , and 1961 ) Presidential campaigns for Le Figaro , and I 've met Vice-Presiderrt Nixon and Senator Kennedy a number of times , so I felt pretty well qualified to tell both sides of the story . " Not long after the Republican Convention , the Paris publishing house of Plon approached M. Chatelain with the suggestion that he write the two books , on the understanding that both would he printed and ready to be published/destroyed the moment the election results were in . " The challenge lay in my haying to treat the election as a fait cccornpli , " M. Chatelain told us . " In one book , I started with a victorious Nixon , giving the man 's background and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the world  --  with special emphasis , of course , on France . In the other book , I did exactly the same thing for le vainqueur Kennedy . By the way , I put that ' Nouvelle Vague ' in the titles because you ca n't sell anything in France these days unless it has a wave in it . " The deadline for the manuscripts was October 20th , just three weeks before the election . Since M. Chatelain did n't start his ambidextrous labors until after the first of August , and since he was covering the two candidates for Le Figaro , life became both frantic and schizophrenic . " I was always on the trail with one man or the other , " he said . " Most of my work on the hooks had to be done late at night , in hotel rooms or on trains or planes , after I 'd filed my regular daily copy to Paris . I rode the Vice-President 's campaign train through Pennsylvania and Ohio , writing after hours about ' President ' Kennedy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelled through California and Texas with Senator Kennedy , spending whatever spare time I had writing about ' President ' Nixon and h ; . r new wave . Made me feel something of a traitor to both sides . " At first , M Chatelain was convinced that Nixon was going to win , but when he saw the enormous crowds that turned out to greet Kennedy , he changed his mind . He believes now that the uncer tainty reflected by this change was a good thing , because it caused him to make equal efforts with the two books . He airmailed the manuscripts to Paris on the evening of October 19th . Plon printed eight thousand copies of each book , then tranquilly awaited the election returns . On the afternoon of the day the results were in , copies of " Le , President Kennedy " were on sale all over Paris , " Until the public learned that I 'd written two books , it was thought that I must have marvellous psychic powers , " M. Chatelain said . " Thank goodness , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'd never have lived it down . " Frozen Assets TURING the celebrated blizzard of 1960 , which is still cold and damp in our memory , a friend of ours presented himself at the impressive branch of the Bankers Trust Company at Madison Avenue and Forty-eighth Street at the waking hour ( For hankers ) of nine o'clock on that Monday when the wind was high and the snow falling fast . lie wanted to cash a check for sixty dollars . The teller stammered something about taking it up with the branch manager , and presently left his cage and returned in the company of an austere gentleman , who announced that he was willing to give our friend twenty-five dollars as a personal loan but just could not ante up sixty dollars . Seems the bank was unable to open the vault where its money is kept , because the men responsible for this midtown Fort Knox were all snowed in in their suburban haunts .
