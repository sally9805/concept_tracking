THE MARKET PLACE <P> So much that was once so simple has grown so complicated in the electro-technological age that new triumphs of human ingenuity are now required to make things manageable again . Items : <P> TELEPHONES could once be activated by merely speaking the number with eyes closed , then had to be worked by coordinating eye and forefinger , and now , with the advent of all-digit dialing , demand intellectual concentration as well . But wait . A device called Dial-A-Word has come to the rescue . A plastic disk that slips over a dial gives a choice of two consonants for every number , which can then be combined with vowels ( which are placed so that they do n't register ) to translate any combination of digits into an easily remembered phrase . Thus the number of the CIA-351-1100-becomes AH ME , CUBA BAY , OY . The New Yorker who wants to call A.T . &; T. to complain about all-digit dialing dials GO WAG A WET YOYO . <P> MILK , which once arrived from the dairy in a pail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is now flowing back by the pailful . Several hundred dairies are now delivering milk in five , six-or ten-quart containers , consisting of a cardboard box shaped to fit easily into the refrigerator ; inside is a plastic bag with a dispensing nozzle . Advantages : the milk , protected from exposure to air and from the " heat shock " caused by removal from the refrigerator , lasts much longer , takes up less room-and is delivered . <P> FISH , which are increasingly difficult to find among the wakes of powerboats , are now indicated by Aqua-Ear , an underwater sonic system that tells the fisherman where to cut off the engine . And the underwater swimmer , after years of face masks that cut vision from 180 to 75 and made the prettiest girl look like a sea monster , can now buy a new kind of contact lens : a tiny mask made of shatterproof plastic that covers the entire eyeball . Invented by Washington , D.C. , Optometrist Alan Grant and Navy Captain Edward Beckman , the new lenses cost $175 a pair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once free for the staring , now crowded by the split-levels , becomes intimate in an outside-the-window plastic bird house called Vue-A-Nest , equipped with a one-way mirror so that ornithological voyeurs do not have to venture outside to see what really goes on among their feathered friends .
