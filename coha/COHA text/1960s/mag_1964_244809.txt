To a television viewer sated with Perry Mason , Sam Benedict , Defenders and assorted colleagues , the supply of first-rate criminal lawyers may appear plentiful enough . But outside the range of the TV camera , the breed is in danger of dying out . Such noble concepts as " right to counsel , fair trial , and due process " will become meaningless , warned New York State Chief Judge Charles S. Desmond last week , unless more lawyers are willing to represent criminal defendants . Addressing Boston University 's graduating law class , he called on law schools to stop pointing students " at the two admired goals of Wall Street law practice and clerkships to appellate judges . " He urged that the schools instead expand their criminal courses and Legal Aid activities to give " students at least a smell of real criminal court work . " <P> <P> Judge Desmond 's complaint is buttressed by some compelling testimony . In the current Atlantic , Chief Judge J. Edward Lumbard of the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York writes that in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer who will kick back to them a substantial part of the fee . " Often this " lazy and incompetent " court hanger-on falsely claims that he can " fix someone " for a higher fee . Since he " seldom knows any law or reads any cases , " his arguments in court are " so transparently hollow that it is not easy for most juries to sympathize with his client . " <P> Actually , things can be better for the 60% of criminal defendants-up to 75% in New York City-who can not afford a lawyer . In many cities , the indigent can rely on a growing public-defender system or on agencies like New York City 's pioneering Legal Aid Society . Yet the city , paying less than half the society 's costs , puts up only $250,000 a year v. $4,400,000 for the district attorney staffs that prosecute most of the society 's clients . Indigents often fare even worse elsewhere , says <P> Lumbard . " The judge usually picks out some lawyer who happens to be in the courtroom , " typically a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes of conference , the defendant is advised to plead guilty , and he feels he has no choice but to do so . Everyone who participates in these proceedings knows that this is a farce . " <P> <P> To remedy the situation , Judge Lumbard would require criminal-trial training for admission to the bar . And he would try to keep lawyers interested in criminal cases by allowing them occasionally to prosecute as well as to defend-a long-admired practice that has helped keep many outstanding British barristers active in criminal law .
