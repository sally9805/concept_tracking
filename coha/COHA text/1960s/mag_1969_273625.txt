Republican Jim Rhodes has done very well in Ohio politics . He was mayor of Columbus for nearly four terms , and after ten years as state auditor he was picked in 1962 to take on Democratic Governor Mike DiSalle . Take him Rhodes did , by the largest majority ever in an Ohio gubernatorial election . Rhodes ' second four-year term is near ly up , and statehouse scuttlebutt has it that the popular and efficient Governor may try for a U.S. Senate seat next year . <P> Now it appears that this impressive record may lose some of its sheen . The reasons , reported by LIFE this week following extensive investigation , are two . Rhodes commuted the life sentence of a major Mafia mobster early this year , ostensibly because of age , ill health and good behavior . And for years , Rhodes has been using political campaign funds for his own personal purposes . Special Favors . The Mafia character is Yonnie Licavoli , now 65 , who has been running Toledo numbers rackets by long distance and raking in underworld income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cell at the Ohio State Penitentiary . He was sent up for life in 1934 for murdering and conspiring to murder two gambling competitors , a Toledo bootlegger and the bootlegger 's girl friend . Before commutation , Licavoli was not eligible for parole ; Ohio law forbids it in the case of a life sentence for first-degree murder . Now , however , the pa role board can vote to free him at any time . Licavoli has relatives who are Cosa Nostra powers in Michigan , Ohio and Arizona . If released , he would live in a Grosse Pointe , Mich. , house until now occupied by an in-law who is still in the rackets . <P> Over the years , three prison officials have lost their jobs for permitting Licavoli special favors . The latest scandal occurred in 1958 , when a state police investigation showed that Licavoli was being allowed unauthorized visitors by the superintendent , who accepted presents from Licavoli 's friends and even turned up as a guest at the Detroit wedding of Licavoli 's daughter . One of Licavoli 's visitors was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Penitentiary at Lewisburg , Pa. , for jury tampering . Only a month ago , Licavoli was transferred from prison to a private hospital , for treatment of a " massive " heart attack . <P> Why Rhodes chose to commute Licavoli 's sentence , thus making him eligible for parole for the first time , is a mystery . Governor after governor had turned down Licavoli 's pleas for clemency . Rhodes himself had done so in 1963 , telling the prisoner : " It is impossible to disassociate your recent good conduct from the extended criminal conspiracy that brought about your imprisonment in the first place . " For years , reports have flourished that Licavoli 's Mafia friends would pay at least $250,000 for his release . In announcing the commutation , Rhodes took pains to observe that an investigation he ordered found " no evidence of such payment or promises . " But LIFE quotes former officials , including ex-Governor DiSalle , as saying that they were aware of bribe offers from Columbus Mafia Leader Mike DeAngelo , among others . LIFE does not contend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
