They are hapless . They are hopeless . <P> But one thing nobody can deny : the New York Mets are fun . <P> Just ask Cincinnati 's Jim Maloney , 25 . Then duck . A hard-throwing righthander , the Reds ' best pitcher ( 23 victories in 1963 , 15 last year ) , Maloney had the easiest of tasks to perform last week : beating the Mets , who had lost ten games in a row . He started off with a whiz , throwing three straight strikes at the first batter he faced : Outfielder Billy Cowan , 26 , who walked away muttering " I never even saw the ball . " One after another , the Mets paraded to the plate ; one after another , they slunk back to the dugout . Third Baseman Charlie Smith struck out three times and sighed : " Nobody has ever pitched a baseball faster . " First Baseman Ed Kranepool , the Mets ' only .300 hitter , insisted-with a tendency toward the cliche-that " Maloney should be in a league by himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show for their efforts was a walk-and no runs , no hits , and 15 strikeouts . <P> That should have been that . But the Reds were not tearing the cover off the ball either . Into the tenth inning the game went , with the score tied 0-0 . Maloney retired the Mets in order , striking out two more . Again Cincinnati failed to score . Then it was the eleventh , and up came Met Outfielder Johnny Lewis , possessor of a .245 average . The count went to two-and-one before Maloney made his only mistake of the night : a waist-high fastball , straight down the pipe . Bang ! Home run . Final score : Mets 1 , Reds 0 . <P> Maloney will still get credit in the record book for pitching a ten-inning no-hitter . And he could take some solace from the fact that nine other pitchers have hurled nine-inning ( or longer ) no hitters and lost , including two still active in the major leagues : Baltimore 's Harvey Haddix and Milwaukee 's Ken Johnson . What 's more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $1,000 raise ( to $31,000 ) . It would take more than that to comfort him . " I have n't a thing to be proud of , " he said . " I just lost to the New York Mets.
