txt What 's ahead ... While the American steel industry was in the front room bargaining with labor , more foreign steel than ever was coming in the backdoor . Steelmen found that imports in March soared to a record 1,025,200 tons . Steel officials predict total imports will mount this year as high as 8 million tons . That 's almost an entire month 's domestic production . It will shatter last year 's all time record-6.4 million tons . The American Iron and Steel Institute meets later this month with government officials . Steelmen then will doubtless urge stiffer curbs on steel " dumping . " International oil companies are turning a worried eye on Libya . They have between $1.25 billion and $1.5 billion sunk in Libyan oil . And the country 's unsettled politics is worrying them . King Idris I now rules as monarch of Libya . But this may give place in time to a republic . That fills the future with uncertainty , even seizure . Another concern is Egypt 's President Nas- ? ser . He has financial problems at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he might try to lay his hands on Libyan oil revenues . So far present political disquiet there has n't turned into a political storm . But all eyes are on the barometer . Trends Moscow may be losing steerageway with Peking politically , but it still has an economic oar in the water . Soviet and Chinese foreign trade negotiators have just signed a trade protocol for the current year . It apparently is n't any bigger than last year . And last year 's volume was down to little more than a quarter what it was in 1959 . But negotiations continue and both sides hope for more . Peking , meanwhile , is actually stepping up trade with its East European cousins in the Communist bloc , expecially with Poland , Czechoslovakia and East Germany . Although Soviet satellite nations now enjoy more leeway from Mostow it is unlikely they would crank up their Peking trade without Soviet blessings . The new Soviet leadership hopes trade will pave the way to better political relations with Peking . And so far Peking has n't dashed that hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , the mass food emporiums are getting plushier all around . Aisles are growing wider and fixtures fancier . And in Rochester , N.Y. , a new 11,000-square-foot market sports red wall-to-wall carpeting . It is said to be only the second in the nation and carpetmakers hope it is n't the last . The maker of the Rochester market carpet says : " There 's a psychological difference . The carpet feels better . It is quieter . Customers tire less and stay longer , thus spending more money . " The American real estate industry has found a fountain of youth : home buyers are younger than ever before . Young married couples are building or buying homes five to 10 years earlier than they used to . The average age of the new home owner now is 31 . Last year , 44 percent of all homes sold under Federal Housing Administration financing went to buyers under 30 . Young men now can buy or build sooner thanks partly to lower monthly payments and longer mortgages . Most also start work now at higher salaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more as the post-World War II baby crop matures . How and why ... Common markets are becoming common . Clumps of nations seeking lower tariff walls within , but higher barriers against the outside , are banding together . Europe 's Common Market has proved an enormous success . Now one is being planned for South America . Another is already taking root in Central America . And the idea of a common market for the Pacific Basin is making the rounds . The Pacific scheme is . largely visionary now . Australia mainly is pushing it , hoping for an economic link with Japan . But talks may ' eventually broaden to embrace the United States , Canada , New Zealand , Malaysia , and the Philippines . Prime spur to a Pacific Basin common market is the emerging economic and political presence of mainland China . If ties between non-Communist Pacific nations could be buttressed , it might shift the balance of economic weight away from the Chinese vortex.                   @ @
