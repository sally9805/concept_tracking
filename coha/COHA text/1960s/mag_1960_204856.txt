In 38 years at the game , Publisher Samuel I. Newhouse has never exhausted either the will or the cash to buy newspapers . Fortnight ago , he added to his 14 papers by acquiring a healthy $3,600,000 slice of the Denver Post ( TIME , June 20 ) . Last week , still hot after bargains , Newhouse made a quick trip to Massachusetts , came home with a $4,000,000 piece of Springfield 's three jointly held newspapers . <P> If anything , the second buy was a better bargain than the first . The Denver Post has been barely scraping by on the balance sheet , but the three Springfield papers-the morning Union ( circ. 80,968 ) , the evening News ( 99,998 ) and the Sunday Republican ( 112,352 ) - produce a cool net profit of $1,000,000 a year . <P> As usual , Newhouse made his move at just the right time . A tightly held family empire that began with the establishment of , the Republican in 1824 by Samuel Bowles , the papers have remained in the family for four generations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1952 , the family grip loosened . Sherman Bowles gave 45% of the stock to his wife and four children , but they can not vote the stock and do not gain possession until 1967 . Another 40% was distributed among other relatives , the remaining 15% to the newspaper employees ' pension fund . <P> Newhouse 's move was to buy the 40% block and rights to the 45% held by Sherman Bowles 's immediate family . Even though employees hold voting rights to the family share through 1967 , Newhouse is assured eventual control .
