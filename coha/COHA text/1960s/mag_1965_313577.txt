After hearing President Johnson 's State of the Union address , the Louisville Courier-Journal had a noble vision . ANOTHER MOSES STARTS TOWARD A PROMISED LAND , went the headline above the Courier 's editorial assessment of the President 's message : " One is constrained to believe that the land in deed is promised , and the leader is worthy . " In Chicago the Tribune was moved too-but in an opposite direction . " The secular savior is to take us over , " said the Tribune , " and give us the bum 's rush up the road to his conception of the Great Society . " Between these two extremes , the editorialists found ample room for disagreement . But whether they cheered Johnson 's sweeping blueprint or worried about the blue-sky aspects of his plan , on one point the U.S. press seemed in complete agreement . The Scripps-Howard newspapers put that question succinctly : " Where is the money coming from ? " <P> Revolution-by-Consent . Columnist Max Lerner , whose most recent book was called The Age of Overkill , used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of price . " The State of the Union address , " said Lerner in the New York Post , " won our assent because we were wholly ripe for it-and Johnson had helped make us ripe . But it was full of worn and weary phrases . Its key concept of the Great Society has never been thought through , either by Johnson or-as far as we know-by anyone around him . Nothing in the speech , in word or idea , left a scar . " <P> Today in Washington , Lerner said , there is a new kind of Congress , a new kind of President and an extraordinary Supreme Court . " Put the three old branches of the Federal Government together in their new forms and you get something that ought to be the most impressive revolution-by-consent in American history . " <P> But can Johnson lead that revolution ? Lerner was filled with doubt . " A revolution is a mood and a climate , " he said . " It is against power abused and injustice encrusted . . . it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heady madness of winning through . One feels that Johnson by his innermost nature is incapable of generating such a revolutionary climate and leading such a mood . <P> " Somehow ( how in the world did it happen ? ) Johnson has been cast-perhaps has cast himself-in the role of the Great Prestidigitator , the Miracle Worker . Step up and watch him , Ladies and Gentlemen . See how nimble , see how quick . Watch the incredible performance of this master . . . And because it is a performance we watch , with fascination , with admiration , in the end perhaps with acceptance tinged with boredom . Such a man can carry votes with him ; he can not lift our hearts nor stir , our brain . " <P> Need for a Nexus . " Certain things come-or look-easy for Johnson . These are the things he does well : the medicare bill , the program for new health centers , the formula for an education compromise . But there are other things that look-and are-hard for him . They are the things he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in global policy ( and the Viet Nam case is only one , although the chief one ) , where getting a wide assent is not enough , and where the expanding wealth of our nation will not resolve the problem .
