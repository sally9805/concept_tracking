txt JACKSON , Miss. , June 26-A wave of 12,000 to 15,000 singing , shouting marchers brought the long civil rights march through Mississippi to an end today by crowding around the State Capitol and demanding immediate and widespread reforms in the treatment of Negroes . The last eight-mile leg of the march started slowly from Tougaloo College but picked up momentum as thousands of Mississippi Negroes in their Sunday best flocked into the column from street corners , churches and lawns . They argued with policemen , stepped to the tune of a fourpiece brass band and cheered when a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee burned a Confederate flag on the Capitol grounds . Hundreds of National Guard troops , state highway patrolmen and other law enforcement officers , many of them carrying tear gas and riot guns , looked on . Factionalism within the rights movement continued to mar the march until the last minute , with leaders barring officials of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People from speaking at the Capitol rally . But few in the crowd appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Meredith , the Negro who started the march on June 5 from the lobby of the Peabody Hotel in Memphis and then watched it grow after he was shot the next day along a Mississippi roadside 20 miles south of Memphis . " From what you 've seen on television and what you have read in the newspapers , " said Mr. Meredith , who desegregated the University of Mississippi in 1962 , " you might assume that I had been shot by a Negro , since all you 've been hearing is about the Negroes being divided . " But from this day on , our // focus is going to be on the issue freedom . " They cheered the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . when , in a variation of his " I have a dream " speech that he used during the march on Washington three years ago , he declared that his dream " had turned into a nightmare . " He said he had seen too many Negroes perish from poverty " in a vast ocean of prosperity " and too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he still has a dream , he said , " that even here in Mississippi justice will come to all of God 's children . " The marchers also cheered Stokely Carmichael , chairman of the Student Committee , when he declared that Negroes " must build a power base in this country so strong that we will bring them whites to their knees every time they mess with us . " LawrenceGuyot , head of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party , was cheered when he said Negroes should be:made aware of ' three things at birth ? white supremacy , neocolonialism and black , power . : There were cheers , too , for Dr. Alvin Pousaint of the Medical Committee for Human Rights , when he said : " The civil rights movement is doing more for the mental health of Negroes in this country than anything else . " I Whitney M. Young Jr . of the National Urban League also pleased the audience when he said more Federal job training programs were on the way for Mississippi .

" MOre than 11506 whites , some of them waving Confederate flags and . jeering , watched at the Capitol , but the police kept them away from the : marchers and kept the marchers 75 yards away from the Capitol , Building , confining them to the north side . Unlike last year 's march to Montgomery , which drew 25,000 persons , there was no Governor to watch the proceedings from his . office . Gov . Paul B. Jphnson Jr . of Mississippi was in Biloxi on the Mississippi coast . It was a hot , humid day , and many marchers walked away silently from a rally that at times appeared to be anticlimactic . ' Will Go Down in History ' Many complained because the front row of the column , which included the heads of civil rights organizations and Walter P. Reuther , president of the United Auto Workers union , stopped the march frequently so that lesser rights leaders could walk with them in front of the television cameras . But many enjoyed all nine hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done been , " said Monroe Williams , a 78-year-old retired Negro marcher who bobbled to the Capitol . on a cane . " If my daddy had done this it would have been a lot better for me . Now all of this ai n't going to help me none  --  it 's too late for that  --  but I 'm doing it for the children . " Dr. King declared that the march and rally " will go down in history as the greatest dem ? onstration for freedom ever held in the state of Mississippi . " The state police , who estimated the rally crowd at 10,00C to 12,000 , and Justice Department officials . who estimated it at 15,000 , agreed that they could not recall a larger rights gathering in the state . " It 's everybody , " , said ' " Mr. Meredith , who complained his leg wounds and rode in . a car during most of today 's march . " You ca n't do any better that that . " Although the march and rally were without serious incident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson , a white man from Brookhaven , for assaulting a Negro marcher with his fists . And at the Capitol , Assistant Attorney General John Doar , agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Jackson police ringed the white bystanders when they spotted Ku Klux Klansmen in the crowd . A white man shoved Justice Michael A. Musmanno of the , Pennsylvania ' Supreme Court from his lawn and then dashed into his house as more than 100 Negroes surged toward him . Three houses away , a white man stood by a no-trespassing sign with a brick in his hand , but two of the 11 Negroes on the Jackson police force quickly stepped between him and the marchers . Am Illinois Central railroad engine moved toward ? the marchers as they stepped over a crossing . While the engine was still b movine- , Robert Green of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and 10 others rushed in front of it , mounted its cow catcher and shouted , " Stop , stop . " The engine ground to a halt within 10 to ' 15 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave today 's march because of his wounds , it was led by Dr. King ; Mr. Young , Mr. Reuther , Mr. Carmichael and Floyd B. , director of the Congress of Racial Equality . Missing from the marching column was Charles Evers , Mississippi field director for the National Association for the Advancement ' of . Colored Peci : . ple , ; mid other leaders of the N.A:A:C.P. - They were banned from the Capitol rally program during a : sti*tegy session of march leaders that started : late last night and continued into this morning . The reason the leaders gave for- the exclusion was that Mr. Evers had repudiated the " march manifesto " during the first week of the demonstration . he said then that it was " too criticaPof President , Johnson and that . ' feared Many of the Marchers would " leave with the cameramen " when the march Was over and.leave Negro MissiSSippians " holding the bag . " However , Mr. Evers joined the protesters ' column two weeks ago and said he was convinced the ' march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' A Good Man ' " Charles . gvers is a good Man , " , Mr. - qzmcq#Kissick said . He- said Mr. Evers had been preVented . from signing the March ? manifesto by the N.A.A.C.P. national office . ' The Congress of Racial Equality , the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee , the Delta Ministry of theaVational Council of Churches and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party voted to limit , the rally platform to - leaders. of . organizations that had signed the manifesto . - Dr . King 's Southern Christian Leadership ' Conference and the Medical Committee for Human Rights voted against the limitation . Mr. Young of the Urban League was allowed on the platform after he had agreed to ' sign the manifesto . The manifesto demands that President Johnson send Federal voting examiners into 600 Southern counties , make sweeping changes ' in his pending civil rights bill and start a massive aid program for ' Negroes . Organizational rivalries repeatedly flared in today 's march on the Capitol . The Student Committee passed out placards that said " Move on Over or We 'll Move on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the symbol of the committee 's independent Negro political movement . CORE passed out posters saying " Freedom Now , " and the Leadership Conference distributed hundreds of plastic United States flags . The sight of the waving flags sent Willie Ricks , a field secretary for the Student Committee , rushing into the march column . " Give me those flags , " he said . " That flag does not represent you . " The Rev. John Morris , directo , of the Episcopal Society of Cultural and Racial Unity , rushed over to Mr. Ricks and urged him to leave the flags alone . Supporters of the Student Committee repeatedly roared the organization 's new chant , " Black power , black power . " Supporters of the Leadership Conference tried to drown out the chant by yelling " Freedom , " freedom . " - Mr. Meredith made it clear , that he supported " black ' power ? ' A Student Committee partisan yelled the chant , and James Orange , a field secretary for the Leadership Conference , bellowed " Freedom " in response . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of his swagger stick at Mr. Orange . " You mean you can say ' Black power , ' but we ca n't say ; Freedom ? ' " Mr. Orange asked . Mr. Meredith stared ahead . It was the wounding of Mr. Meredith on his pilgrimage into Mississippi to encourage voter registration that sent civil rights leaders hurrying from throughout the nation to the ambush. scene to pick up , the march . Some 2,000 persons left the Tougaloo College ca:inpus today for the last leg of the march and picked up . recruits along the way . Within an hour , the column had grown , to more than 3 ; 000 and it continued to swell . Mrs. Molly Gray , a 61-yearold Negro domestic , placed chairs under her Mimosa , tree and served water to more ' than 20 Negroes who were waiting on her lawn to join the march . As she sat under her tree , a truckload of Student Committee workers passed shouting " Black power . " , , Mrs. Gray chuckled and yelled , " Black power ?

" Near the end of the march , Mr. Green of the Leadership Conference charged that a city policeman had threatened to shoot him . He said that he had received permission from police officials . to drive a truck alongside the line of march to pick up tired marchers . . He said the policeman . had stopped him , jumped on , the hood of the truck , aimed his pistol at Mr. Green 's head and said , " Get that God damned truck out of here , nigger , or I 'll blow your God damned head off . " A crowd of whites standing nearby yelled , " Shoot him , shoot him , " Mr. Green said . He drove the truck away . At the end of it all , many : Student Committee memberA I went away smiling . They had succeeded in plastering " black panther " bumper stickers on Jackson police cars .               @ @ @ @ @ @
