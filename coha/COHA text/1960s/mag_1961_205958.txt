Inge Borkh is a tall ( 5 ft. 9 in. ) , handsome opera star with a crushing tennis backhand and a disconcerting habit of sitting about nude in her dressing room . <P> Both her athletic bent and her theatrical temperament combine to make Swiss-Austrian Soprano Borkh one of the world 's most impressive performers in two of her favorite roles-Salome and Elektra . Last week , for the first time in nine years , Strauss 's Elektra returned to the Metropolitan Opera , and Soprano Borkh all but blew the house down . <P> When Elektra had its premiere in Dresden in 1909 , it nearly shocked the critics out of their seats . For the better part of two hours , Strauss 's orchestra rages , shrieks and howls with a kind of demented fury . Moreover , Librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal 's reading of Sophocles bristles with frank Freudian overtones of a kind the operatic stage had not seen before and would not see again until Berg 's Wozzeck . All in all , the audience tended to agree with the fabled Ernestine Schumann-Heink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it again . " It was frightful , " said she . " We were a set of madwomen . There is nothing beyond Elektra . We have lived to reach the farthest boundary in dramatic writing for the voice with Wagner . But Strauss goes beyond him . " <P> In last week 's performance , Strauss 's one-act shocker still had plenty of power - from the moment the enlarged orches tra came crashing to life , through the frankly erotic music accompanying the incestuous recognition scene between Elektra and Orest , to Elektra 's shrieking " Stab her once more ! " at the news that Klytaemnestra had been struck down . But the performance also was a reminder that Elektra no longer has the almost physical shock value it possessed in Strauss 's time : overlaying the stark story is a thin coat ing of German Gemtlichkeit that too often turns passion to mere posturing . What redeemed the Met 's Elektra was a splen did job of conducting by Joseph Rosenstock and the singing of Soprano Borkh , who rose triumphantly over the raging orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
