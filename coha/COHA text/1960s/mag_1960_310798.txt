It was Premier Karim Kassem 's major public appearance since an assassin 's bullets sent him to the hospital last October , and a special reviewing platform of steel and brick had been erected for just such occasions . For eight hours he intermittently appeared and disappeared , while the crowd below shrieked " yaish al zaim " ( Long live the leader ) . <P> " Everyone knows , " said Kassem next day , " that I am not mindful of death . I have always run with patience , courage and daring after death . " Then he denounced Egypt and Jordan for stealing parts of Palestine , blandly called upon Syria to rebel against Cairo . " We are brothers to all Arab states , " he cried . " We are brothers . . . " <P> Stay Back . It was just the sort of thing the headstrong Iraqi like , and Kassem himself could use a boost to his sagging popularity . Since the attempt on his life , he no longer cruises about in his old Chevrolet station wagon ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearances are limited to ten minutes each , and no stranger is allowed within 20 yards of him . In Baghdad , for the first time , there is even an occasional wisecrack about him . <P> But after exactly 18 months in power , Kassem is still quite literally Iraq 's " sole leader , " and he apparently feels he can afford some changes . The Iraqi press , ' though a year ago Communist-dominated , now is permitted a degree of opposition unknown in Cairo , Jordan or Iran . Last week political parties were applying for licenses to operate legally for the first time since 1954 . And though the Communists have for 18 months enjoyed Kassem 's favor , he has succeeded so far in keeping them pretty well at arm 's length . <P> For more than a year , a steady stream of Soviet aid and military equipment poured into Iraq . But even in aid , Iraq has proved stubborn . It has stayed clear of nationalizing the profitable oil industry , whose exports last year rose to a record 39 million tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantations that each year give Iraq the world 's largest date crop . And last week , as a result of old-fashioned consumer resistance , Iraq ended a year-long attempt to direct trade toward the Communist bloc by once again allowing Western automobiles to come in . <P> House Divided . Though still the strongest political organization in the land , the Communists no longer enjoy the unquestioning popularity that immediately followed the abortive military revolt in Mosul last March . They pressed so hard for admission to Kassem 's Cabinet that the Premier 's right-wing supporters rose , and fighting broke out in Baghdad . In July the first anniversary of the revolution was marred by a savage Communist-inspired massacre of rightists in Kirkuk . Shocked , Kassem ordered a roundup of Communist leaders-while characteristically taking two party-liners into his Cabinet .
