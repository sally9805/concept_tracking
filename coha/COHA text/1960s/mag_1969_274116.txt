SOON after early-morning prayers at Jerusalem 's Al Aqsa mosque one day last week , flames burst from the ceiling beneath its famed silver dome . For three hours , the fire raged , destroying part of the roof and an 800-year-old pulpit of exquisitely carved cedarwood and inlaid ivory , a gift from the Islamic hero Saladin ( 1137-1193 ) . Before Israeli and Arab firemen could extinguish the flames or anyone could investigate the fire , the entire Middle East was echoing with outraged Moslem demands for jihad-holy war . <P> Al Aqsa is one of the holiest shrines in all Islam . It is inside a 34-acre compound that also contains the Dome of the Rock mosque , built on the site from which Mohammed is said to have ascended to heaven . The compound ranks behind only Mecca and Medina in importance to Moslems . Al Aqsa itself is considered a particularly propitious place from which to begin a had , or pilgrimage , to Mecca . Jews also revere the compound as the traditional site of Solomon 's temple . <P> Automatic Assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Al Aqsa blaze had been started deliberately-and by an Israeli . Hundreds of Arabs rushed to the still-burning mosque , threatening firemen who were trying to control the blaze and shouting " Nasser ! Nass-er ! " When Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan arrived on the scene , he was jeered . An Arab mob coursed down the Via Dolorosa-the path Jesus took to the Crucifixion-shouting " Death to Israel ! " Police blocked them at the fifth Station of the Cross . <P> The Israelis , who have ruled Arab Jerusalem since 1967 , protested their innocence , but in vain . Premier Golda Meir convoked an emergency Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem to offer help in repairing the mosque ( the offer was spurned ) and to appoint an investigating commission that included two Arab dignitaries ( local Moslems named their own board of inquiry ) . Sheik Hilmi Al-Muh-tasib , chairman of Jerusalem 's Moslem Council , quickly summoned newsmen to pointedly announce that " a blond , freckled man dressed in khaki , who did not appear to be a Palestinian , " had been seen fleeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the information that Arab propagandists needed . Cairo Radio called the fire a " premeditated crime . " Al-Fatah , the Palestinian Arab commando organization , demanded shrilly in its broadcasts : " Moslems , what are you waiting for ? The Zionists are burning down your sacred shrines . How can you face the Prophet Mohammed ? " Jordan 's King Hussein , whose grandfather King Abdullah was assassinated by a Palestinian Arab gunman in front of the Aqsa mosque in 1951 , called for an Arab summit meeting . <P> At first the Israelis maintained that the fire was accidental . A welding torch was found beneath the roof , where work men had been repairing old timbers treated with inflammable linseed oil . Some angry Israelis suggested that , just as the Nazis had burned down the Reichstag and blamed it on the Communists , Al-Fatah terrorists had set fire to the shrine so that the Israelis could be blamed and emotions aroused throughout the Arab world .                    @
