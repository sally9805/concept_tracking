txt Letters to The Times Kerman Backs Sales to Tito Opposition Declared Harmful to the Cause of Anti-Communism The writer recently retired as Ambassador to Yugoslavia . He is now a member of the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : There was reported in your columns on Oct. 11 a statement made by Senator Everett Dirksen and Representative Charles A. Halleck , criticizing President Kennedy for permitting , by an order of May 14 , 1963 , the sale of $2 Million of military supplies to Yugoslavia . The President 's action . they were quoted as saying , constituted a circumvention of Congressional stipulations prohibiting military aid to Communist nations . The legislators referred particularly to the provisions of the 1963 Foreign Aid Appropriations Act , which they described as flatly prohibiting military aid to Communist nations , though leaving economic aid to the President 's discretion , subject to certain restrictions enacted in 1961 . This description of the legal situation is not accurate . The act referred to did indeed inhibit aid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President to make exceptions in instances where he considered this to he " vital to the security , of the U.S. " This applied to sales of military supplies as well as to economic aid . The President was wholly within his rights in making such a finding . Payment for Equipment With respect to the particular sale in question , the term " aid " ought never to have been used . Our military aid program for Yugoslavia was terminated some six years ago , at the initiative of the Yugoslays . Since then they have paid dollar cash for military equipment purchased in this country . They will do so in the present instance . The inclusion of such sales under where they would have no choice but to re-submit to Soviet leadership . Why any member of Congress , and particularly any Congressional leader , would wish this to be said of him  --  and how , in particular , he could reconcile it with a professed devotion to the cause of anti-Communism  --  escapes me .

This same article suggests that the other permanent structures at this site will probably suffer a similar fate . Such tragic waste of precious facilities is deplorable . A need not occur . Some , if not all , of the permanent structures now taking shape at Flushing Meadow can be preserved so as to render great public service to the people of this city and to generations to come .

The Weil(i 's Fair site presents a unique oprortunity for this borough as well for all the people of the City of New York . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Increased Dependence The insistence of the Congress that the Yugoslays be denied even obsolete and surplus items for which they were willing to pay cash has been a major factor in causing them to turn again to Soviet sources of supply . The effect can only be to increase the dependence of their military establishment  --  one of the largest military establishments in Europe outside of Soviet control ? on Soviet sources of supply . In this respect , the effect is analogous to that of the recent legislation denying the Yugoslays normal tariff treatment for their exports to this 2ountry . If , faced with such rebuffs from Dur side , the Yugoslays still retain their independence , as I believe they will , this will have to be ascribed in : he circumstances solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of , and in defiance of , the best efforts of some of our legisators to put them in a position and go off to the mountains to hunt .

At any rate , tradition has it that one autumn the Indians . who were understandably tired of getting shot at , massacred a large group of boys , and that since then " Indian Summer " has been only a name . BENJAMIN K. BENNETT , New York , Oct. 9 , 1963 . Against Park Parades To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : J. Kroll 's letter published Oct. 7 proposes something very frightening .
