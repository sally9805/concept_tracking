Once they were called the beautiful people and were presumed to have titles . Others knew them better as the idle rich . But today there are few titles among them , they are not that rich , nor are they idle . Less grand than the grandest of an older generation , but also less ostentatious , they might be called the New Elegants . And they are not a numbered set revolving around a few Manhattan town houses and Newport mansions but a relaxed confraternity that extends the length and breadth of the land . <P> They are dedicated wives ( generally to high-powered men who dabble equally in politics and the arts , wear dinner jackets and parkas with identical ease ) and devoted mothers ( generally to no more than four picture-book children with fanciful names like Chloe and Sabrina , Tared and Clive ) . Somehow they find time for charity work , church functions , community projects and college alumnae drives . They are enthusiastic music lovers ( with a predilection for baroque quartets , German lieder and early Dixieland , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a penchant for abstract expressionists , pre-Columbian sculpture and 18th century French furniture , a marked aversion to teak and leatherette ) . <P> They prefer concerts and auctions to canasta and golf , are likely to spend the time their mothers relegated to ladies ' luncheons to tracking down a Directoire commode for the foyer , just the right bronze for the living-room mantle . If not elaborately educated in the mechanics of cooking , the New Elegants are nonetheless possessed of a sophisticated palate favoring simple Continental cuisine-everything light in body and definite in flavor , including the wines . <P> Sit Down at Home . But it is as hostesses , often to as many as 40 guests at as many as three sittings a week , that they are most practiced and most properly celebrated . Skilled in every facet of party giving , from the arrangement of flowers to the decision ( reluctant but mandatory ) to hire an extra couple to take coats and pass drinks , they have the energy to perform a well-worn role as if it were the choice part - in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list with an eye toward a lively , varied pattern ( putting banker next to deep-sea diver , Senator between pop artist and prima ballerina ) , and the social status sufficient to commandeer acceptances all around . <P> Lately , moreover , they have dismissed the short cuts-the vast cocktail party and the buffet supper-for the older , more elegant sit-down dinner . <P> Gone today from the boards that count are the stacks of plates and flatware wrapped in napkins ; vanished , like the overhead light , are the women in sensible , street-length silks . More and more , the discriminating tables across the land are set with ornate silver on cloths of heirloom lace . And , gleaming in the dim , expensive light of tall candles , sit some of the handsomest people in some of the handsomest dresses that the age provides . The New Elegants have rediscovered the pleasure of dressing up . <P> Art after Dinner . The trend can be documented in economic statistics .                 @ @ @ @
