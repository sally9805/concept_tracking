In Saigon 's yellow stucco Freedom Palace , South Viet Nam 's President Ngo Dinh Diem woke with a start . Mortar shells were falling on the lawn , and paratroopers were assaulting the palace gate . <P> Tough , zealously anti-Communist Ngo Dinh Diem , 59 , had been in tight spots before ; he kept his nerve . From guard posts on the grounds and from within the building , Diem 's two loyal battalions of palace guards gave as good as they got , turning back truckload after truckload of insurgents trying to charge the gate to the grounds . Diem himself repaired to a radio station that he had thoughtfully installed for just such emergencies . " A group of junior officers revolted at 3 a.m. , " he announced . " Liaison with my provincial commanders is temporarily disrupted . " He ordered reinforcements to move on Saigon . Then he sat down and prepared to wait it out . <P> Civilian Stunts . In the streets outside , bullets whined overhead and sprayed against trees and buildings . But a crowd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman riding by in a taxi was hit and killed ; her body was dumped near the palace wall . To cheers from the crowd , daredevil youngsters ran out to drag wounded rebel soldiers back to safety . <P> At 8 a.m. the paratroops brought up three armored cars and two weapons carriers , which slowly circled the palace grounds , blasting away at the guardhouses . Later , four tanks rumbled up and joined the battle , and an ancient 25-pounder , wheeled into action by the rebels , shrouded the scene in black smoke . At noon the paratroopers marshaled a big crowd of civilians and told them to march on the palace . The crowd got as far as the gate , but , when firing broke out from the palace , turned and ran . <P> Ivory Tower . From his command post near by , Lieut . Colonel Vuang Van Dong , 30 , who declared himself " chef de coup d ' tat , " explained what the fighting was all about : " We want to end politics in the army . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamstringing the army 's efforts to wipe out Communist terrorism . Chimed in a paratroop captain : " All Diem has done in six years in office is indulge in nepotism . He has generals who do n't even command a company . He lives in an ivory tower surrounded by his family , so we must depose him . If we allowed things to continue , it is obvious that in a year this country would go Communist . " <P> By midafternoon , with some 20 people already dead , Ngo Dinh Diem still held out in his barricaded palace . Emissaries shuttled back and forth between the two sides . Diem offered to fire his Cabinet but refused the rebel demand that he resign . Diem 's stubborn courage began to pay off . Marine , infantry and commando units moved into the city and , after wavering all night , declared their loyalty to him . Outmanned , the paratroopers fled . When a throng of civilians advanced on the palace waving " Diem Must Go " signs , the pro-Diem marines fired point-blank into the packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Dong tried to flee aboard a DC-3 but was forced down and captured .
