At the back , an opening through a thicket leads to the principal town . Forward on the stage is a palm-thatched summer house without walls . Under its roof is a rustic table and bench ; on the table some worn books . On the floor at one side of the stage is a piece of glass , fringed with moss ; this represents a spring . Gulliver , forty-six , drags himself on in the last stages of hunger and exhaustion . He sees the spring and avidly laps at it with hand and tongue . Somewhat refreshed , he lies down and closes his eyes . Then rising to a sitting position , he becomes aware of the summer house . He goes to it and opens one of the books . In great amazement he murmurs : " English ! In English ! " In the distance a young woman 's voice is heard lilting a kind of yodel . It ceases and is resumed several times . Gulliver makes a shell of his hands and calls : GULLIVER Anyone ? Is anyone there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone there ? VOICE ( Nearer : ) ' Oo are you ? GULLIVER ( Still calling : ) I am an Englishman , madam , shipwrecked on this island . p. 3 VOICE ' Oo ? ' Ooh ? GULLIVER I am Captain Gulliver , at your service , madam . VOICE ' Ooh ? GULLIVER Captain Gulliver  --  Lemuel Gulliver of the fourmaster Arcturus , Port of London , at your service , madam . VOICE Oh ! Lord . ' Ow old are you ? ( Gulliver , nonplussed , does not answer . ) ' Ow old are you ? GULLIVER I 'm forty-six years of age . VOICE ( Just offstage : ) No ! ! No ! ! Forty-six ! ' Ow did you get here ? GULLIVER I was shipwrecked , madam . I have been in the sea for three days , pushing a spar . I am sorely in need of food and am much dependent on your kindness . ( Enter Mistress Belinda Jenkins , eighteen . She gazes at Gulliver with growing abhorrence , covers her face with her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) JENKINS Oh , Lady Sibyl ! ' Ow ' ideous ! ' Ow unbearable ! ( Enter Lady Sibyl Ponsonby , twenty-four . Both are charmingly dressed as of the eighteenth century in some textile-like tapa cloth . Lady Sibyl is a great lady , however , and carries a parasol tufted with seagulls ' feathers. ) p. 4 PONSONBY ( Staring at Gulliver , but with more controlled repulsion ; as though to herself : ) It 's hall true ! Then it 's hall true , wot they say ! ( Pronounced " si " ) JENKINS ( To Gulliver , spitefully : ) Turn your fice awigh ! How can you look at Lady Sibyl ? PONSONBY ( With authority : ) ' Old your tongue , Jenkins . JENKINS ( Pointing : ) But he 's terrible ! He 's terrible ! PONSONBY ( Coldly : ) Yes .  --  You are ' ideous to behold . GULLIVER I 'm a plain man , madam ; and in addition I have been without food and drink for three days  --  and with very little sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never seen an old man before . Forty-six , you say ? It 's hall true , too true . JENKINS ( Peeking from behind Lady Sibyl : ) The wrinkles , your ladyship . Nobody could count them !  --  Can he see ? Can he hear ? PONSONBY ( From curiosity not kindness : ) You must be suffering in every part of your body ? p. 5 GULLIVER I have suffered , madam , principally from thirst until I found this spring here ; and I would be most beholden to you if you could also graciously give me something to eat . PONSONBY I shall never forget this moment . You are , indeed , a most pitiable spectacle . GULLIVER ( With dignity : ) I shall turn my face away if it distresses you , madam . JENKINS All of you is as repulsive as your face . GULLIVER I am as God made me and the hardships I have endured .  --  If you would graciously provide me with the means I could catch fish to assuage my hunger . I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PONSONBY ( Musing : ) At your age everything must be painful  --  exceedingly  --  breathing and walking GULLIVER ( Loud : ) Young woman , are you indeed deaf ( Pronounced " deef " ) or do you lack humanity ? I am starving . JENKINS " Young woman ! " You are talking to Lady Sibyl Ponsonby . PONSONBY Be quiet , Jenkins .  --  Old man , you will be given something to eat . There have been other old men on this island . They were given something to eat before they departed . p. 6 GULLIVER I hope that will not be long . PONSONBY That will not be long . GULLIVER Did I understand you , madam , did I hear correctly : that you have never seen a man of forty-six before ? JENKINS Forty-six ! No one has ever seen anyone older than twenty-nine  --  except one that floated up from the sea , like yourself . There is no one on this island older than twenty-nine and there never will be . GULLIVER Merciful Heavens ! What do you do with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone to attend to your needs . You will not follow me ! You will not leave this place . Today is a day of festival and it is of the highest importance that no one sees you  --  that is , as few as possible see you .  --  Jenkins , stay near him . JENKINS I , your ladyship ! ! PONSONBY Do not enter into conversation with him . ( Appraising him coldly ) I do not think he could progress far . JENKINS ( Becoming hysterical : ) Oh , your ladyship , your ladyship  --  do not leave me alone with him . I will become ill with the sight . ( She falls on her knees , clinging to Lady Sibyl ) I will become ill . I will become ill. p. 7 PONSONBY Get up , Jenkins !  --  Very well , I will stay with this man . Go to the Duke of Cornwall . Draw him aside and speak to him in a low voice . Tell him that we have come upon this foreigner . ' E will know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth : ) And tell him  --  PONSONBY Tell him the old man is hungry .  --  But , Jenkins , hold your tongue . Do not speak of it to anyone else . JENKINS To think that this should happen today  --  of all days ! ( She sidles up toward Gulliver and examines him intently . Softly ) Think of all the years he has lived ! PONSONBY Jenkins ! JENKINS ( Still scanning Gulliver ; half answering : ) Yes , milady . PONSONBY Jenkins ! Do as I tell you ! JENKINS Yes , milady ; but I shall never see an old man again . I want to look at him ( Lower ) he is not as abominable as he was at first . One gets used to him , a little .  --  Old man , have you wives and children ? PONSONBY Belinda ! I shall have you jailed ! p. 8 JENKINS ( Turning to her , with spirit : ) Your ladyship , with all due respect to your ladyship , your ladyship has been extremely severe with me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail . As I was the first person to see this old man I ask to be permitted to have a few words with him . PONSONBY Two minutes , Belinda No more . ( Lady Sibyl turns her back on them and moves to the rear of the scene , striking her parasol on the floor . ) GULLIVER Yes , Mistress Jenkins , I have a wife Mary , a son John , and a daughter Betsy . JENKINS ( Slowly , scarcely a question : ) And are you very cruel to them ? GULLIVER Madam ? JENKINS Old men are cruel and nasty tempered . Everyone knows that . ( Gulliver gazes deep into her eyes with a faint smile , slowly shaking his head . She continues , as if to herself . ) Your eyes are different from our eyes . Maybe some old men are a little bit kind . ( Gulliver , as though in friendly complicity , rubs his stomach with one hand and conveys the other to his mouth . ) Yes , I will hurry .  --  I am going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( She looks toward the sun , almost directly overhead ) The games are about to begin . When you have delivered your message , take your place in silence . p. 9 JENKINS ( Curtsies : ) Yes , your ladyship . ( Belinda goes out . Lady Sibyl starts strolling about with great self-possession . ) GULLIVER Surely , I did not hear correctly  --  no older men ? PONSONBY I have no wish to enter into conversation with you . GULLIVER ( After a short pause , no longer able to contain himself : ) By God 's body , madam , you can not be of stone ! You are not a child ! I have not hitherto been regarded as a contemptible being . I have been received by kings and queens and have been their guest at meat I am Captain Lemuel Gulliver . I am not a dog . PONSONBY I have never seen a dog , but I think you must greatly resemble one . GULLIVER Madam , you have seen nothing but one small island . You are not in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am astonished that you have no questions to put to me about the world that surrounds you . PONSONBY ( Lofty smile : ) What questions would those be , Captain Gullibo ? GULLIVER Madam , ignorance is a misery , but there is one still greater : a lack of any desire to increase one 's knowledge . p. 10 PONSONBY But I have learned much from you in this short time . You have come from that world out there ( She indicates it lightly with her parasol ; her voice turns suddenly vindictive ) and you have brought its poisons with you . Your visible infirmities are also marks of the country from which you came . They must be as painful for you to bear as for us to behold . However , you will not have to bear them much longer . ( Gulliver gives up trying to understand her . He sinks down on the bench by the table . He is about to fall asleep . ) Captain , it is not our custom for a commoner to be seated in the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head ) I see ; you are deaf ( Pronounced " deef " ) . I said : it is not the custom for a commoner to be seated in the presence of the nobility . GULLIVER ( Dragging himself to his feet ; with ironic deference : ) Oh oh your ladyship will forgive me my fatigue and my hunger . ( Lady Sibyl puts her hand into her reticule and brings out some lozenges , which she places on the table . ) PONSONBY While you are waiting , here are some comfits which I have been keeping for my children . p. 11 GULLIVER For your children , Lady Sibyl ? PONSONBY Our children on this island live in a village of their own . They are well tended . They are happy . That is our custom here . ( In astonishment , Gulliver is about to ask a question . He corrects himself , and , bowing , says in a low voice : ) GULLIVER I thank your ladyship . ( He puts two into his mouth ravenously ; then takes one out for decorum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chord from many harps , is heard from the city . Gulliver listens in astonishment . ) May I ask your ladyship the source of that music ? PONSONBY You forget everything you are told . Today is a day of great festival . ( She looks at the sun ) It is beginning with the children 's Morris Dance and  --  GULLIVER Oh , milady , I would greatly wish to see this festival  --  PONSONBY ( Slight laugh , " how unthinkable " : ) These will be followed by the Hoop Dance and the Dagger Dance . The Duke of Cornwall  --  who will be here in a moment  --  is the greatest victor in the Hoop Dance that has ever been known . He has won eight garlands . Moreover , he is the only man who has ever kept a kite in the air for an entire day . p. 12 GULLIVER Ah ! ! He must indeed be remarkable ! An entire day ! I trust that the duke is of mature years ? PONSONBY ( Sharply : ) I did not hear you correctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is naturally of mature years . He is our governor . He is twenty-eight ( Pronounced " ite " ) . GULLIVER ( Stares at her ; then with dawning horror : ) Great Heavens , girl ! What do you do with your older persons ? PONSONBY Captain Gullibo , there is no profit in pursuing a conversation on matters you are not capable of understanding . GULLIVER ( Shouting : ) You kill them . You murder them when they reach the age of twenty-nine ? PONSONBY How dare you address me in that manner ?  --  Vulgar brutish Englander ! Barbarian ! How could you understand customs that are based on wisdom and reason . GULLIVER I dread to hear them ! ( Louder ) Are you able to answer me : what do you do to those who reach the age of twenty-nine ? PONSONBY ( Slowly ; with serene assurance : ) We drink the wine . We sleep . We are placed in a boat . The current carries us away . p. 13 GULLIVER Thunder ! This is hellish ! PONSONBY ( Putting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence , Captain Gullibo . GULLIVER And you , your ladyship  --  are you going to drink that wine and go to sleep in that boat ? PONSONBY When I am old  --  readily , gladly . I have four years to live . That is a very long time . GULLIVER And no one ever rebels ? No one twenty-nine years old ever wishes to live longer ? PONSONBY Captain Gullibo , you prate . You rive . You forget that you are old  --  very old . What I have told you is the custom of this island ! Do you understand the word " custom " ? Would any of us wish to be GULLIVER ( Hand to head : ) Your ladyship must permit me to sit down . ( He does ) PONSONBY ( Strolling about and fanning herself : ) It is understandable that the duke is occupied today . ( Severely ) Your arrival is most inopportune . GULLIVER The matter was beyond my control , Lady Sibyl . Little did I know that I was arriving on this happy island on the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall arrange it with greater propriety . p. 14 PONSONBY ( Looks at him and raises her eyebrows : ) Future occasions , Captain Gullibo ? At your age , Captain , you can not speak with certainty of future occasions . GULLIVER ( Returning her glance ; in a low voice : ) Lady Sibyl , I am thinking of your children . You will never know the joys of seeing them grow into young manhood and womanhood . You will never hold grandchildren on your knees . PONSONBY You are tedious , Captain Gullibo . I have read of those things in books . GULLIVER Ah , madam .  --  You have books , I see . PONSONBY We have one hundred and twenty-seven books , Captain . GULLIVER ( Lowers his head in admiration ; after a pause , suddenly humble and earnest : ) Lady Sibyl , let me throw myself upon your mercy . You are a woman , and women in all times have tempered this rough world with mercy and compassion . I have arrived a stranger and an interloper here ; I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see that you have much influence on this island ; graciously exert it on my behalf . I saw that there were boats drawn up along the shore . I am a seaman of experience . When I have been given some food to stay my hunger , be my advocate with this Duke of Cornwall  --  p. 15 PONSONBY ( Purest amazement : ) Where would you go ? GULLIVER ( Pointing : ) That island or continent those mountains PONSONBY ( Harshly : ) I have nothing to do with such matters . Those fishing boats and their sails are fixed to the shore . They are locked with thongs that only a few nobles can undo .  --  You forget that you are old  --  very old . Your life is over . Anyone can see that . ( She turns away ) GULLIVER I have a wife and children .  --  You said you have children ? PONSONBY Naturally I have children . GULLIVER Look in your heart . Enable me to  --  PONSONBY Be silent ! GULLIVER ( Sinking onto the bench ; to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last thing that will be learned by man . ( He puts his head on his arms and is about to fall asleep ) PONSONBY ( Walking up and down , loftily : ) You may be certain that nothing will be done here that is not for the wisest and the best . We are enlightened here ; and we are Christians . That strain of music you heard came from Westminster Abbey . The Archbishop of Canterbury is addressing the contestants in the games . If you were a young man we would be proud to show you how happy our existence is , and how perfect our institutions . This perfection is rendered possible by the fact that here we have no  --  ( Gulliver has fallen asleep. ) p. 16 GULLIVER ( Mumbling : ) steep the steep streets Redriff , home ! Mary  --  Polly ! Polly , forgive me ( He falls silent . Lady Sibyl gazes at him for a moment with repugnance , then draws nearer and scans his face intently  --  a long gaze . When he stirs and seems about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strolls off the stage.In deep stupor Gulliver slips off the bench and rolls under the table.Lady Sibyl returns hurriedly ; there is a suggestion of walking backward as though royalty were approaching . Enter the Duke of Cornwall , twenty-eight , very splendid in festival dress . To the early eighteenth-century costume have been added feathers and colored shells , etc . He is followed by Simpson , twenty , a commoner , carrying a tray of food . The Duke gazes fixedly at Gulliver . ) PONSONBY He has fallen into a swound , your grace . DUKE OF CORNWALL Simpson  --  throw some water on his face . ( Simpson scoops some water from the mirror pool and throws it on Gulliver 's face . Gulliver recovers consciousness , stirs and cumbrously extricates himself from under the table . Finally , he grasps the situation and , standing erect , confronts the Duke , eye to eye . ) Who are you ? GULLIVER Lemuel Gulliver , your grace , captain of the fourmaster Arcturus , Port of London . p. 17 DUKE OF CORNWALL How old are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am forty-six . DUKE OF CORNWALL They tell me you have been three days without food  --  Simpson , place the food on the table . Eat ! GULLIVER I thank your grace . Commoners do not sit in the presence of the nobility . I shall eat when you have left to take part in the festival . ( Pause . ) Sir , I have visited many countries and have been shipwrecked on the shores of several . In all of them , save one , I have been treated with courtesy as a citizen of England and a subject of our gracious sovereign , Queen Anne . I am indebted to you for this relief from my hunger . I trust that hereafter I may see your cities and learn of your customs . In return I shall gladly tell you of other parts of the world that I have visited ; and above all of the country whose language you speak and from which your ancestors came . DUKE OF CORNWALL ( Again a short contemptuous pause ; then with a curt gesture of the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson ! SIMPSON Yes , your grace ? DUKE OF CORNWALL Withdraw to a distance . It is not suitable that a commoner hear this nonsense . I shall call you when it is time for you to stand watch over the captain . ( Simpson bows and goes out . Gulliver begins to laugh to himself and , turning away , sits down. ) p. 18 PONSONBY ( Revolted : ) He is laughing ! ! GULLIVER To be young , and yet ask no questions about the country from which your ancestors came ! To be young , and yet have no curiosity concerning the shore that lies upon the horizon ! To be young , and yet  --  oh , ye immortal Gods !  --  to be without adventure of mind or generosity of spirit ! Now it is clear to me why you so gladly bring your lives to a close at the age of twenty-nine  --  gladly was Lady Sibyl 's word . DUKE OF CORNWALL ( Bitingly : ) That should not be difficult for you to understand  --  you , with this decay of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! No , it is not the advance of age that frightens you on this island . ( With a sardonic smile ) A greater enemy threatens you . ( Abruptly changing the subject ) I do not wish to detain your grace from the festival and from your trophies . DUKE OF CORNWALL Come , Lady Sibyl . GULLIVER Permit me , however , one question . ( The Duke nods ) What is the name of this island and this country ? DUKE OF CORNWALL Name ? Why should it have a name ? p. 19 GULLIVER I have visited twenty countries . Each has borne a name in which it takes pride . DUKE OF CORNWALL Proud ? All of them were proud ? GULLIVER They were . They are . DUKE OF CORNWALL Among those twenty countries was there one that was not governed by old men  --  governed , misgoverned , burdened , oppressed by old men ? By the pride and avarice , and the lust for power of old men ? One which did not constantly war at the instigation of old men like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to enrich itself ? We know of the War of the Roses . Or by the religious bigotry of old men  --  we know of the Saint Bartholomew Massacre , the murder of Charles , king and martyr . And when these prides of yours have obtained their lands , whose bodies are those lying upon the field of battle ?  --  They are the bodies of men under thirty . We need no name to distinguish this country from others . Say that you are in the Country of the Young . GULLIVER So be it !  --  Since you do not wish me to encumber you longer , I request some boat with which I may rid you of my presence . ( In amazement ) How did you come here ? Who brought you here ? DUKE OF CORNWALL God ! GULLIVER God !  --  Where did you acquire this distrust and hatred of the old ? p. 20 DUKE OF CORNWALL We have no boats for that purpose . GULLIVER The smallest would serve me . DUKE OF CORNWALL No boat of ours has ever made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will let me purchase a boat . This ring was given to me by the King of Laputa . It is of pure alchemist 's gold . DUKE OF CORNWALL You have been here a few hours . Lady Sibyl has told me that already you have offered us insult and have spoken of our customs with contempt ; and now you wish to introduce barter and trafficking , and gold !  --  gold , which is above all the instrument by which old men keep the younger in subjection . There is no gold and no trading here . You shall never leave this island and you shall not long envenom it . We shall make you a present for which we ask no return . We shall give you the only happiness that still lies open to you . GULLIVER Duke of Cornwall  --  Duke of Palm Trees and Sand ! I wish you a happy twenty-ninth birthday . I can understand that you will gladly drink the wine and welcome the long sleep . Twenty-nine years of jumping through hoops and flying kites will have been enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  yes , toward boredom , infinite boredom . Youth left to itself is a cork upon the waves . As we say of the young : they do not know what to do with themselves . It is only under the severity  --  the well-wishing severity  --  of your elders that you can shake from yourselves the misery of your aimless state . You elect yourselves into societies and call yourselves dukes and earls ; did I hear correctly that each man on this island has several wives ? You play games . What more can you ask of a thirtieth birthday than a deep slumber ! p. 21 PONSONBY ( Ablaze : ) Your grace ! How can you let him speak to you so ? ! DUKE OF CORNWALL ( With a smile : ) But this is what we knew ; foul and embittered age ! Envy and jealousy ! Despising those things of which he is no longer capable . ( Whimsically to Lady Sibyl ) Perhaps we should take this man and exhibit him for all to see . PONSONBY ( Covering her face : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear , your grace . DUKE OF CORNWALL And to hear .  --  What would you say to them ? GULLIVER Why , I should tell them that if a man is not civilized between the ages of twelve and twenty  --  civilized by his elders  --  he will never be civilized at all . ( Lady Sibyl covers her ears . ) And oh , it is not an easy task . To educate young men is like rolling boulders up to the tops of mountains ; the whole community is engaged in the work and with what doubtful success ! For every one Isaac Newton or Christopher Wren there are thousands who roll to the bottom of the mountain and occupy themselves with jumping through hoops . ( He sways from weakness , his hand to his head and heart . ) Go to your dances and garlands . I can see that your happiness has begun to stale already . You are weary of life . Old age has marked you already . p. 22 DUKE OF CORNWALL ( With supreme complaisance : ) Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Mr. Simpson ! ! ( The sound of music has been rising from the distance . Enter Simpson . ) SIMPSON Yes , your grace ? DUKE OF CORNWALL Simpson , you are in charge of this man . See that he does not leave this clearing . Do not enter into conversation with him . It would suffocate you . Later I shall send someone to replace you  --  Lady Sibyl ! ( Lady Sibyl 's hand has gone to her forehead ; her parasol and reticule fall . She is about to faint . ) PONSONBY Oh , your grace this sight has sickened me . DUKE OF CORNWALL ( Cold fury : ) Take command of yourself ! ( With a gesture he orders Simpson to pick up the fallen objects . Simpson does so and holds them ready for Lady Sibyl . ) PONSONBY ( Swaying ; with closed eyes : ) I must breathe a moment . DUKE OF CORNWALL Fool ! ( He strikes her sharply on both cheeks ) Go to the city ! GULLIVER ( Taking two steps forward : ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUKE OF CORNWALL We permit no weakness here  --  neither ours nor yours . GULLIVER ( Turns and seats himself on the bench by the table : ) Humanity is the last thing that will be learned by man ; it will not be learned from the young . ( Lady Sibyl has taken her parasol and reticule . She collects her dignity , but is scarcely able to leave the stage . ) DUKE OF CORNWALL Simpson ! SIMPSON Your grice ! DUKE OF CORNWALL If you fail at any point in your guard over this man , you will be put to the press  --  and you know what press I mean . And you will be removed from your hoffice as builder and constructor . ( He looks appraisingly at Gulliver ) If he tries to leave the clearing , kick him strongly at the shinbones . ( He goes out . Simpson takes his stand at a distance from Gulliver whom he watches intently . Gulliver returns to his meal , but seems to have lost his appetite . Again there is a sound of music from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there no way , Mr. Simpson , that I may view the games from a distance ? ( Simpson shakes his head ) I am sorry . ( He eats a little ) They must be a wonderful sight wonderful . Hoops and kites . ( Pause ) You strike women is that often , Mr. Simpson ? Do you strike women frequently , Mr. Simpson ? ( No reply ) You are very proud of your civilization when you are angry you strike and you torture ( Simpson mutters something . ) I did not hear what you said , Mr. Simpson . p. 24 SIMPSON He is old . Strikes and tortures because'e is old . ' E will die next year . GULLIVER He will be killed next year . That is not quite the same thing as merely dying . He will be killed . No wonder he is excitable , Mr. Simpson . In the normal way of life we grow of a more mild and kindly disposition with the years . ( He eats ) So you are a builder and constructor , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Westminster Abbey . I would like to see it . Did you build this Westminster Abbey , sir ? ( No answer ) You have great storms in this part of the world  --  far greater than London has . You must build very  --  solidly . Have you rock here ? ( Simpson points off . Gulliver rises and peers in the direction ) Coral limestone , I presume . Not easy . Arches and a vaulted roof . Ah , you should see the dome of St. Paul 's . There 's a sight , Mr. Simpson ( He eats ) I am glad that you feel no disposition to talk , sir . I was afraid that you might ask me questions about the life led by young men like yourself in my country . ( Pause ) It would fill me with shame to describe it to you . ( He lowers his voice as though imparting a discreditable secret ) Imagine it ! You would be working all the time to acquire more knowledge : from morning to night  --  and at night by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to govern the people more wisely , to be a better builder , Mr. Simpson . Go down on your knees , sir , and thank your Maker that you live on this happy island where learning never penetrates , where young men are not encouraged by old men to extend their knowledge and their skill . p. 25 SIMPSON ( Loudly : ) The old men drive them like slaves ; the old men take the credit and the profit . GULLIVER The young men succeed them . They are not killed at twenty-nine . They become master builders themselves and may decide whether they will be just or unjust . However , I do not wish to talk about it . I reproach myself that I am preventing you from taking part in the games . SIMPSON Commoners do not take part in the games . GULLIVER Ah ! ( He eats ) ( Simpson gazes at him , brooding . ) SIMPSON I 'm a builder . GULLIVER ( Looking up at the summerhouse : ) Ah !  --  you made this ? SIMPSON Aye  --  and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the chief builder . SIMPSON The chief builder is an earl . He has no time to build . GULLIVER The new Abbey is of stone  --  of sandstone or coral ? SIMPSON The pillars at the corners are . GULLIVER And the roof ? ( Simpson shakes his head . Gulliver points to the thatch ) Of thatch ?  --  of palm boughs ? ( Simpson nods . ) But , man , you have severe storms here . Ah ! ( He looks up ) Mr. Simpson , the storm that cast me on your shores has damaged this charming shelter , this pagoda . Was your Westminster Abbey able to sustain the fury of that wind and rain ? ( Simpson stares straight before him ) You will not answer me , man ! Your Abbey seats  --  what ?  --  four hundred . Of what is your roof ? Of palm fronds ? ( Simpson , without moving his eyes , nods ) I see ! When storm destroys your Westminster Abbey you build another . I see ! I see ! You do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Simpson , do not ask me the secrets of the arch , the buttress and the dome . You are happy . Remain happy . Do not let us think of all the labor that went into those discoveries . p. 26 SIMPSON ( Taking steps toward Gulliver ; in a low voice : ) Sir Mr. Captain ( His hands describe an arch ) Do you know how to pile stone so they will not fall ? GULLIVER Believe me . Mr. Simpson , I did not arrive in this paradise in order to poison it with thoughts of progress and industry . SIMPSON But you do know ? GULLIVER Perhaps in a hundred years some unhappy youth will be born with talent  --  with genius . He will light upon the laws of the arch . He will prove that youth stands in no need of its elders , no need of the accumulated wisdom of its ancestors . He will make a roof Bring your ear nearer , young man : the dome of St. Paul 's ( His hand describes a high dome ) SIMPSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men standing on one another 's shoulders could not touch the top of it . SIMPSON ( Back three yards : ) You are lying ! All old men lie . Eat your food . Go to sleep . I ask you a question and you give me a lie . ( Simpson has raised his head ) GULLIVER What I said is true , but your rebuke is justified . There is no greater unkindness than to arouse ambition in a young man .  --  But you are to blame . You asked me a question . ( With assumed indignation ) A few more questions like that and you 'll be proposing that we take a boat and cross to that shore . No I 'll not go , I tell you . p. 27 SIMPSON ( Sullenly : ) The boats are tied and we can not untie them . GULLIVER Yes , those thongs the nobles keep ( His eyes are looking off speculatively ) SIMPSON They 're twisted and untwisted with hooks of iron . GULLIVER Iron ? SIMPSON Aye , they 're the only pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GULLIVER Very wise ! Some fool might think of journeying out there for knowledge and science .  --  Understand , young man , I 'll not leave this island . Give me this day here ; then bring the wine and the long sleep . Why should a man trouble his head raising domes ? Fly kites , jump through hoops , beget children and sleep . SIMPSON ( After a pause , grumbling unintelligibly : ) These things you call secrets GULLIVER I can not understand you , sir . SIMPSON These things you call the secrets of the arch and the batless  --  old men keep these secrets to themselves , that 's certain . GULLIVER ( Sternly : ) Cease , Mr. Simpson , to talk of things you know nothing about . p. 28 SIMPSON How would a young man learn them ? GULLIVER You are asking dangerous questions , Mr. Simpson .  --  Let me bid you again to go down on your knees and thank your Maker that you do not live in a country where older men would urge you and struggle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and skill . SIMPSON I do n't believe you . GULLIVER  --  A young man would learn them by crossing that water and finding his way into a world that does not spend all its time in games and dances . SIMPSON ( Mumbles : ) I do not believe you . ( Suddenly loud ) All old men are wicked . GULLIVER ( Simply : ) I am the only old man you have ever seen . SIMPSON ( Approaching Gulliver , the beginning of violence : ) Then tell me  --  GULLIVER What ? SIMPSON The secrets : the arch and the batless . GULLIVER ( Backing away : ) I do not know them . SIMPSON ( Seizing Gulliver 's throat : ) Tell me them ! Wicked old man , tell me them ! p. 29 GULLIVER ( Forced to his knees : ) I am not a builder . I am a doctor and a seaman . SIMPSON ( As they struggle : ) I will not let you go before you tell me  --  ( Gulliver faints . Pause . Simpson leans over him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter Belinda carrying a tray and more fruit . She starts back in consternation . ) JENKINS ( Whispering : ) Is he dead ? Have you killed him ? SIMPSON ( Sullenly : ) No he has died of his old age . ( Belinda puts her ear to Gulliver 's mouth . ) JENKINS I think he is still breathing . It is a swound . ( Both are on their knees gazing at Gulliver . ) Now I do not think he is ugly at all . I think he is a friend . SIMPSON ( Moves away in inner turmoil : ) I do not understand a word he says . He should not have come here . JENKINS ( As-before : ) What a strange thing wrinkles are . ( Unconsciously she strokes her face softly ) I could ask him questions all day .  --  Mr. Simpson , let him go back to his own people . p. 30 SIMPSON ( Harshly : ) How could he do that ? ( Belinda slowly draws from her apron pocket a hook of iron . Simpson draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ) This is the hook that was lost last year . It was on Lady Sibyl 's dressing table . I think she put it there for me to find it . I think she has hidden it to spite the Duke of Cornwall . ( She holds it out toward Simpson ) Unlock the boat and let the man go . SIMPSON No ! JENKINS ( Gazes at Gulliver . Pause . Low , with energy : ) Go with him ! He is not strong enough to sail the boat alone . Go . SIMPSON Do not speak to me ! No , I will not go among other men I do not know anything . He does not know that we commoners can not read . Every  --  over there  --  would see that I am a booby . JENKINS Mr. Simpson ! Look at him . Come close and look at him ! He would be your friend I think some old people are good . SIMPSON No , I will not go . JENKINS He is waking up . Go away and think ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes off. ) p. 31 GULLIVER ( Opens his eyes . Pause . Sees Belinda : ) Oh ! You are here Where is the young man ? JENKINS He is nearby Will you tell me your name again ? GULLIVER Captain Gulliver . JENKINS Captain Gulliver . If you came to your home again what would you do first ? GULLIVER Mistress Jenkins , I would go up the steep street  --  you have never seen a steep street !  --  I think it would be at sunset I would knock at the door My wife or one of my children would come to the door ( Pause ) Soon we would sit down at the table , and give thanks to God and eat JENKINS ( Laughing , scandalized : ) Captain Gulliver , you would sit down with your wife ! ! GULLIVER Do not husband and wives  --  JENKINS No  --  ! ! ( She laughs ) Sit down ! No man has ever eaten with a woman  --  ! The men eat all by themselves . The nobles in one place . The commoners in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GULLIVER And if I lived on this happy island , when would I see my daughter ? ( She does not answer ) You remember your father ? p. 32 JENKINS Yes . GULLIVER You saw him often ? You loved him ? JENKINS But men live over there GULLIVER The childhood of the race You have slipped five  --  ten thousand years ( Simpson has returned , and half hidden , is listening . ) In a thousand years , Mistress Jenkins , gradually on this island things will change . A man will have one wife and only one wife . I think when your father died at twenty-nine he was just beginning to understand ( Gulliver points to his forehead ) what the joys of being your father could be  --  but it was too late . ( Gulliver clasps Belinda by her shoulders , sadly ) You all die here just before a new world of mind and heart is open to you . ( The music and sounds of celebration have increased , as if approaching . Simpson breaks from his hiding place and rushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulliver 's arm and points toward the sea . Gulliver grasps the situation immediately , starts to go with Simpson , but looks back at Belinda . She remains motionless , staring straight ahead , and does not meet his glance . Simpson drags Gulliver off.Music is louder . Belinda gazes front ; intense , conflicted.Pause.Simpson reappears running . He takes both of Belinda 's hands in his . They look at each other . A decision passes between them . Belinda casts one glance back over her shoulder at all she has ever known ; and they run off to join Gulliver.Music increases . Two Boy Guards , fifteen , rush in with ropes to bind Gulliver for his ceremonial death . The Duke enters behind . They look about , see that Gulliver , Simpson and Belinda are gone . The Duke is the first to realize the implication of this absence . He stands upstage center as the Guards roughly search everywhere . Convinced that the man they were after has escaped , they turn to the Duke.Music takes on a wild , threatening sound.The Duke has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving off , perhaps contemplating his own soon wasted mortality . The Boy Guards gaze intently at him as the lights fade. )
