Ask not what Jack Nicklaus can do for golf ; ask only what golf can do for Jack Nicklaus . What more , that is . In a little over four years as a pro , Nicklaus , 26 , has won 18 tournaments and earned $449,048 in prize money-plus another $2,000,000 or so from endorsements , investments , articles , books and TV . That allows him to live in a $140,000 house , fly his own $225,000 airplane , stuff himself with steaks ( sometimes four per meal ) , and get eleven hours sleep a night . It also entitles him to blow a round now and then . Like the awful 76 he shot in the Tournament of Champions in Las Vegas . Nothing to be alarmed about , said Jack-just a slight hangover . " I 'm still reacting to the week of the Masters . " <P> " Too Bad , Fat Jack ! " Now there was a week . The august members of Georgia 's Augusta National Golf Club were embarrassed when Nicklaus ripped their course to shreds last year-firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masters by nine strokes . Last week there were spongy fairways to deaden long drives and two new greens that were as fast as billiard tables . Hostile fans screamed , " Too bad , Fat Jack ! " whenever Nicklaus flubbed a shot . History was against Jack : nobody had ever won the Masters twice in a row . And so , it seemed , was fate . <P> On the night before the tournament started , Nicklaus ' close friend Bob Barton was killed in a private-plane crash ( along with his wife and another couple ) while en route to watch Jack play . " Golf has never seemed so secondary , " muttered the melancholy champion . " It 's pretty hard to get excited about 5-ft. putts this week . " <P> It was a clear measure of Nicklaus ' greatness that he shot a four-under-par 68 in the first round , when the wind was blowing in gusts up to 30 m.p.h . It was a measure of his state of mind that he soared to a 76 next day , three-putting five greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , he pulled his game together for a third-round 72 that tied him for the lead with Tommy Jacobs , 31 . <P> " I have n't played well enough to have a shot at winning , " said Nicklaus , going into the fourth round . Even so , he came within a hairbreadth . On the 400-yd. 17th hole he laid his No. 9-iron second shot just 40 in. from the hole . Incredibly , he bungled the birdie putt . On the 420-yd. 18th , his second shot left him 40 ft. from the pin ; his long curling putt for a birdie slid an inch past the cup . The tap-in gave him an even-par 288 , locked him in a three-way tie with Jacobs and Gay Brewer , 34 . <P> A Matter of One-Half Inch . Most golfers would have gone to bed with a pill and a prayer for the morrow . Not Nicklaus , the perfectionist . What , exactly , was wrong on those two missed putts ? He got his answer studying a TV rerun . " I had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a few minutes of intense practice to adjust his stance-a matter of about one-half inch . Beaming broadly , he strode onto the first tee for next day 's play-off and slammed his opening drive 325 yds.
