txt This Soviet ship , one of many in Havana Harbor these days , is pulled alongside the fishery docks in eastern Havana where it unloads Soviet produce for ? Cuban market . The Soviet Union has clearly become Cuba 's principal economic and political ally . This is unmistakable to anyone visiting Cuba . One sees many signs of it ? in Soviet and East European equipment and in the presence of numerous people from " the Socialist-bloc countries . " Yet the Soviet : Cuban relationship is a strange one , not always a happy and smooth one . It lacks the geographical convenience and traditional perspective of Cuba 's former close relationship with the United States  --  and there are many here , even some in government , who seem to hanker for a reassertion of the onetime important link with the United States . Still , . the Soviet-Cuban tie is deeply entrenched , and while it shows some signs of fraying around the edges , there is little likelihood of any immediate change in this link . The tie is one of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beneficial in differing ways to both nations . For the Cubans , the link provides substan* // * Moscow - Havana tie stout but strained // tial economic assistance , as well as political commitment , at a time when those traditional Cuban ties with the United States and to a lesser extent also with the rest of the Western Hemisphere have been totally ruptured . For the Soviets , the link provides significant propaganda and psychological benefit , resulting from the geographical location of the island within the Americas and only a scant 90 miles from United States shores . The amount of Soviet aid to Cuba is a much-debated issue . Generally , Western specialists on . Cuba have set the figure at about a milion dollars a day  --  with the yearly total running to $400 million . But The breakdown of this figure , together with problems of converting the actual figure into dollars and cents , suggests that the amount of outright foreign aid is considerably less than the $400 million figure indicates . Carlos Rafael Rodriguez , one of Cuba 's leading economists , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , the subsidy by which the Soviet Union purchases Cuban sugar at more than 4 cents over the world market price on sugar . The going rate for sugar on the world market is less than 2 cents a pound , but the Soviet Union buys sugar from Cuba at 6 cents a pound . Fair prices ' seen In traditional figures on foreign aid , this sort of subsidy payment , which both the Soviet Union and the United States engage in , is seldom included in the over-all aid total . To Dr. Rodriguez , this Soviet aid on sugar purchases is a question of purchasing sugar " at fair prices " and differs little from similar United States payments to other Caribbean sugar producers . " We have received a great deal of help from the Soviet Union in our economic development , " Dr. Rodriguez goes on in discussing the extent of Soviet aid . It includes " credits for our development as well as outright assistance . " The actual figure on aid are not available . Like other Cuban officials , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not available for publication . Still , within what is known and based on some conjecture , there is a feeling here that total Soviet aid to Cuba has leveled off and may well decrease in the years immediately ahead , barring any unforeseen change either in Cuba 's economic fortunes or in the island nation 's political orientation . Indeed , the Cubans have begun to pay back to the Soviet Union limited amounts on debts contracted in 1961 and 1962 . No figures have been released , but the pay-back is viewed here with interest . It is one further indication that the Cuban economy , which has been so heavily de= pendent on Moscow for assistance in recent years , is currently making limited improvements which , if continued , could be the harbinger of a significantly improved economic climate . Still , the dependence on the Soviet Union can be expected to continue . Like so many smaller nations , Cuba needs economic bolstering from a larger country . Dr. Rodriguez , for example , indicates his nation will need additional Soviet credits in the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tions that developing countries have with underdeveloped countries " will characterize Soviet-Cuban relations in that period . Hands-off policy ? To many Cubans , this dependence is considerably different from the sort of depend : , ence on the United States which existed before . Cubans in government here frequently charge that in former times , the United States ambassador in Havana die " - tated Cuba 's governmental policies . " This is not true today with our Soviet ties , " said a top-ranking member of the Cuban political hierarchy , who spoke off the record with this correspondent . " We have our own voice , our own status , our own political independence  --  and the Soviet Ambassador in Havana does not dictate to us. ' l It is precisely on this point that many Cubanologists in the United States see a split coming in Cuban-Soviet relations . They cite economic and political differences  --  and hark back to the visit to Havana in late June of Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin : There is a widespread feeling that Mr ; Kosygin tried to dissuade the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them economic advice . According to speculation in Cuba Mr. Kosygin failed in both efforts . Stability expected But here in Havana , both Cuban and Soviet officials downplay such speculation . They indicate that there were disagreements , but they emphasize rather the continuation of Soviet-Cuban ties . Indeed , despite the differences between the two nations , real change in these ties over the next few years is not expected . Seventh of a series of 10 articles .
