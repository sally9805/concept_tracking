In the two years since he took command of the Christian Democratic Union and the nation from Konrad Adenauer , Chancellor Ludwig Erhard has been widely accused of uninspired leadership . Yet when he formally kicked off his first campaign for office this week at a rally in Dortmund 's vast Westfalenhalle , he appeared the man most likely to succeed when the nation goes to the polls on Sept. 19 . <P> Main reason , of course , is his popularity with the huge mass of voters less interested in political brilliance than in having a solid man at the helm . What is more , Erhard is the man in the middle of three middle-of-the-road parties , and ideally situated to form a coalition with either of the other two in the likely event that the Christian Democrats once again fail to win an absolute majority . <P> The latest opinion polls give them 48% of the " decided " vote , as opposed to the 45% they won in the 1961 election under Adenauer 's fading leadership . Ever so slightly to the left of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor Willy Brandt , with 43% of the projected vote , up from 36% in 1961 . Almost imperceptibly to the right are the Christian Democrats ' junior coalition partners since 1961 , Erich Mende 's Free Democrats , who won 13% of the vote then , but are conceded only 7% this time . <P> No Sidecar . For the next six weeks , as the three party leaders crisscross the republic on their campaign trains , their speeches will underline how fundamentally similar their views all are . All three are in favor of " new initiatives " in German reunification and for continuing support of NATO and the European alliance . On domestic issues , there are only some small differences . If Erhard fares well but misses an absolute majority , he will probably call on the more congenial Free Democrats again , but some of his followers are muttering about the possibility of a " grand coalition " with the Social Democrats if he does less well . <P> But not so long as Erhard is running things . Last week he denounced a grand coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finish line in the C.D.U . ' s sidecar . " The Socialists ' Willy Brandt hinted that he would be only too delighted to join any coalition at all , since such talk could help him in the campaign . <P> But Brandt is one of Erhard 's greatest assets . Cursed with an undistinguished television image and isolated in West Berlin from most voters , he has so far failed to develop into the charismatic personality the Socialists need . Moreover , despite support from students and intellectuals , his party has done little to exploit the latent " time for a change " philosophy that should militate in its favor after 16 years out of power . The party slogan , " Sicker ist sicker " ( roughly , " Play it safe " ) is designed to reassure voters that , despite their Marxist origins , the Socialists are now a respectable , middle-class party - but somehow the words seem more appropriate for , say , the Christian Democrats .                 @ @ @ @
