Billy Graham has pointedly steered clear of civil rights demonstrations . But last week , he started the first phase of a major crusade to see whether his gospel message-that men must love God before they can love one another-can ease some of the racial tension in the South . " As a Southerner , " says Baptist Billy , " I may have a little more influence than a man with a New England accent . " <P> Billy 's first stop was Dothan ( pop . 36,753 ) , a southern Alabama black belt farming center where his brother-in-law is pastor of a Presbyterian church . From there he would move on to the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa , mostly Negro Tuskegee Institute , and Auburn University . Cancelling a vacation and a European tour , Billy will conduct a ten-day crusade in Montgomery in June . During October , he will crusade in Waco and Houston . Striving to accept speaking engagements in parts of the South where he has seldom before preached , he has juggled his schedule to fit in a speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in touch with those fellows , " he says . <P> Integrated Crusades . Billy has often been accused of ignoring segregation , but it is a charge that does not bear scrutiny . Since 1950 , he has refused to speak before segregated audiences , and has quietly integrated his own staff ; one of his 14 associate evangelists , the Rev. Howard Jones of Ohio , is a Negro , and Billy has invited another Negro cleric to join the Graham organization . Speaking in the South , Billy has denounced racial discrimination as a product of man 's sinfulness ; he has refused to preach in South Africa because his audiences would be segregated . <P> Civil rights advocates among the clergy who prefer picket lines to preaching are skeptical about the worth of Billy 's Southern crusade . " I think my ministry is a little bit different from marching , " answers Billy , who believes that the church must cleanse itself before attacking secular ills . " I 've said often that the most segregated hour of the week is 11 o'clock Sunday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secular world when the churches are not integrated . " <P> Under the Cross . In private conversations with Southern civic leaders after his sermons , Billy expects to " say plenty " about the need for racial understanding in the South . Onstage , however , he intends to heal , not harangue , offer the message of the Gospel on race in beyond-the-battle terms . " I believe that under the shadow of the cross of Christ is the place of true brotherhood . " <P> Graham 's critics argue that the sense of spiritual brotherhood he creates often lasts no longer than the memory of his sermon . In answer , Billy argues that a true conversion to Christ inevitably affects man 's racial attitude . Moreover , he believes that his kind of preaching may have a special value for the South , where both white and Negro share a common tradition of reverence for Gospel-centered Christianity . And despite " huge psychological barriers , " Billy believes that the South may well overcome its racial difficulties faster than the North . " We 're building for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at things differently now . "
