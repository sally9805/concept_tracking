txt President Johnson came and left , here at the United Nations , practically unannounced , on the spur of the moment ? but the world organization will long remember the event . It was the first time that a President of the United States visited the United Nations for the sole purpose of paying a call on the Secreta ry-General . Said the President about U Thant : " In this hour of great trial , we need him all the more . " The Secretary-General in turn found the talks " cordial , frank , and useful . " He said they provided " no basis for either optimism or pessimism . " The two men are known for their blunt speaking . They were together for 50 minutes Friday afternoon . Secretary of State Dean Rusk , Ambassador Arthur J. Goldberg , and UN Undersecretary Ralph J. Bunche were also present . " We had a very complete ? review of the world situation , including Vietnam , and exchanged viewpoints , " the President stated . Few here doubt that Vietnam topped the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact made Delegates at the United Nations hardly had had time to read through the President 's speech when Mr. Johnson appeared in person . He came through the Secretariat door , to signify that it was not the foreign ministers and the ambassadors he was seeking out . In fact he met none . But the impact had been deep just the same . A foreign minister from an Eastern European country was overheard to say : " Because of this I will have to rewrite my own speech . " The reactions among Eastern European delegates were mixed . Some felt it was the most sincere gesture of open hand to the Communist nations since President Kennedy 's historical address at American University , which marked a turning point in East-West relations . Others , while approving of the substance , expressed concern that nothing'would come of the proposal because of the Vietnam situation . But no one called it mere propaganda . The Eastern Europeans are eager to see the Iron Curtain go down forever and to establish with the West close commercial and cultural links . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gigantic // Surprise visitor United Nations Secretary-General U Thant was surprised with a visit by President Johnson Friday when the President Made a quick trip to the New York metropolitan area . Besides the courtesy call on Mr. Thant , the President addressed the National Conference of Editorial Writers and a Democratic political rally in nearby Newark , N.J. Johnson 's visit : UN impact assessed // strides at this session of the General Assembly . It is equally true , however , that most Europeans , some more , some less , criticize United States policy and are concerned over the future . Even though no one doubted the sincerity of the President 's call for a community of action  --  the ghost of Vietnam just would not go away . " All this is very constructive , " a diplomat commented , " but what are we going to do about Communist China ? " When President Kennedy made the speech which paved the way to the Moscow treaty on the suspension of nuclear tests , the world was at peace  --  or at least as much at peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . There was nothing then that prevented the other side from reaching out to the open American hand . This time the situation is different . The Soviets will find it almost impossible to react to President Johnson 's overtures as they did to President Kennedy 's , without giving the impression to the world that in so doing they are abandoning an ally  --  North Vietnam  --  which is under heavy American attack . Many observers here wonder whether this will not go down in history as the time of missed opportunities . They feel the war in Vietnam could be concluded honorably if only the parties concerned accepted U Thant 's three points , beginning with the first which calls for the suspension of air attacks on North Vietnam . True , U Thant wants the Americans to take the first step . His request is based on the assumption that a powerful country gains more by being generous than by insisting on simultaneous moves . It also presupposes a stop in the mutual accusations of " aggression . " It would be tragic , it is believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is winning were to prevent the march toward a greater understanding among nations , and the receding of suspicions . Everyone here hopes that the President 's offers to Europeans , East and West , might prove of historical significance . Some fear it might represent instead another missed opportunity .
