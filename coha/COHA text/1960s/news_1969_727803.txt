txt - When an alarm sounds in the volunteer fire department of Pleasure Ridge Park , a community south of Louisville , Capt . . Rudolph Lunsford , 41 , is anything but particular about what he wears . Yesterday he was observed at the scene of a fire with his chest bare and wearing nothing but a pair of Bermuda shorts under his firefighter 's coat . He readily admitted this was no accident , that he just did n't take the time to dress . Getting his fire truck to the scene  --  fast  --  was the main consideration . Lunsford was at home asleep when his fire alarm monitor sounded . The alarm came from a critical area , and speed was of the essence . Capt . Lansford threw off his pajamas , donned the Bermuda shorts , and ran out of the house barefoot . He jumped into his auto and drove a block and a half to the fire house . Lansford explained his philosophy : " If I take the time to get dressed it might mean that someone may be burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact that it was chilly yesterday made no difference . " I 've ran oat to fires when snow is vim the ground dressed no differently , " he said .
