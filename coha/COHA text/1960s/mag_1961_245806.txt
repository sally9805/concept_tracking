Cuba 's two most important exile groups , after months of quarreling , met last week to form a shadow government dedicated to the liberation of their homeland . As flashbulbs popped in Manhattan 's Biltmore Hotel , Manuel ( " Tony " ) Varona , 52 , coordinator of the middle-roading Revolutionary Democratic Front , and Manolo Ray , 36 , chief of the farther left Revolutionary Movement of the People , shook hands and proclaimed the existence of the Cuban Revolutionary ouncil , in effect a government in exile , with a program and a president . <P> Good Credentials . The Cubans promised to restore the republic 's U.S.-style 1940 constitution , promised to free trade unions from Communist domination and to return confiscated property to its rightful owners . The council also promised to hold free elections within 18 months after victory , to outlaw the Communist Party , and to abrogate all trade treaties with the Communist bloc . <P> Chosen to head the revolutionary government : Jos Mir Cardona , 58 , a respected Havana lawyer , whose credentials are as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mir Cardona was Fidel Castro 's first Prime Minister but quit in anger and disgust after 39 days . Never much of a politician , Mir Cardona leads no movement of his own and promises to serve only until elections , for which he will not be a candidate . When and if the council manages to win a piece of Cuban soil , Provisional President Mir Cardona will move in , and the council will be formally renamed the Provisional Government-in-Arms . <P> What remains is to liberate Cuba , and for that major task the exiles do not tell their plans . Despite bland official statements that the U.S. has no attitude whatsoever toward the Revolutionary Council , the fact is that the U.S. helped bring the two spatting groups to the negotiating table . Whatever aid the exiles might get from the U.S. is something else no one is talking about . <P> On their own , the exiles hardly seem strong enough to threaten Castro 's well-armed dictatorship . The Varona group has about 2,500 men armed and trained as an invasion force to challenge Castro 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the council 's invasion scheme : " Behind that plan there must be something more . There is a more complex plan because they could not rest their hopes on a group of mercenaries . " <P> Reverses in the Hills . Castro has reason to sneer . For 14 months large groups of rebels have been fighting a desperate battle through the hills of Cuba . It is a battle that Castro is winning . He has poured 60,000 militiamen into the central Escambray hills alone and claims to have captured 80% of the 1,000 rebels operating there . Though the claims are undoubtedly exaggerated , the rebels have been scattered , disorganized and discouraged . Several leaders have been killed , others captured ; a few have been smuggled out of Cuba to Miami , where they are trying to reorganize for another attempt . <P> Last week , two guerrilla leaders recently escaped from the Escambray told a TIME correspondent in Miami of the pres sure Castro was putting on the rebels . At first , arms could be smuggled in overland , but now Castro 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been choked off . A radio transmitter was sent into the hills for use in arranging airdrops.
