A big and somewhat frightening book last week gave President Kennedy a text for the opening announcement at his news conferences . The book was the National Science Foundation 's last-word analysis of the Soviet system of education , which reports that Russia 's much publicized output of scientists and engineers has " markedly accelerated . " <P> Kennedy reported that in contrast to the Soviet effort , U.S. universities are now enrolling and graduating fewer students in engineering , biological and physical sciences than in the peaks of recent years . At a time when the need for highly skilled Americans is sharply rising , he warned , the " inadequacy " of the supply is ' ' one of the most critical problems facing this nation . " <P> The N.S.F. report was written by Nicholas DeWitt , 38 , a bearlike ( 250 lbs. ) native of the Ukraine who owes his unSlavic name to Dutch-German ancestors . <P> A onetime aeronautical engineering student in Kharkov , he made his way to Boston in 1947 , got an M.A. in international and regional studies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now an associate at Harvard 's Russian Research Center , and one of the West 's leading experts on Russian education . <P> An Army of Technicians . DeWitt is not a doomsayer blind to the weaknesses in Soviet education . But he warns bluntly : " There must be no misunderstanding or underestimation of the Soviet scientific and technical manpower buildup . It has become the principal source of Communist strength . " The Russian goal is clear : to create an army of scientists and engineers who will build a physical power superior to the West 's . To do so , Russia now spends as much on education as the U.S. , though it is only half as rich , and it gets more of what it wants for its money . In the 1960s . Russia will probably produce 4,000,000 university graduates-of whom 2,500,000 will be scientists and engineers , more than twice the likely U.S. output . <P> At the A.B . level , 57% of Russian degrees are in science , engineering , medicine and agriculture , against 25% in the U.S. ( One-third of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 1% in the U.S. ) Three-quarters of Russian Ph.D . candidates are in the same fields , compared with 40% in the U.S. <P> DeWitt finds that the quality of Soviet training in technological fields is at least as good , sometimes better than in the U.S. and Western Europe . One reason is early exposure : physics is introduced in the fourth grade , and one-third of the Soviet secondary curriculum is devoted to science and mathematics . Moreover , says DeWitt. the very specialties that the state gives top priority are those freest from Marxist hobbles . The result is first-rate training .
