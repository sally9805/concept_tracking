By and large , the fellows who coach college crew are about as poor-mouthed as the coaches in any other sport . Say something nice about their boys and their eyes open wide in disbelief ; the corners of their mouths curl down , and they launch into a wail about injuries and other miseries . Harvard 's Harry Parker , 29 , has only been varsity coach for three years . So he has a lot to learn . When experts say this year 's Harvard eight is one of the best college crews in the history of the sport , Parker not only agrees but goes up a stroke . " I suspect that this crew is faster than most , if not all , previous college crews-faster at whatever distance . " <P> The Crimson has gone to the mark four times so far this year . Until the Eastern Sprint Championships last month , no one has come closer than 5 lengths . In the Stein Cup race on Boston 's Charles River , Harvard shaved 10.2 sec. from the 1-mile course record , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , on Princeton 's choppy Lake Carnegie , the Cantabs knocked an incredible 20.8 sec. from the Compton Cup 1-mile record , swamping M.I.T. by 7 lengths and Princeton 9 lengths . In the 1-mile Adams Cup regatta on Annapolis ' Severn River , they finished 5 lengths ahead of Navy and 9 lengths in front of Pennsylvania . The 2,000-meter Eastern Sprints on Worcester 's Lake Quinsigamond were a little closer : Harvard walloped undefeated Cornell by 2 lengths-widest margin in the Sprint 's 20-year history . " Even seeing does n't help , " mutters Princeton Coach Dutch Schoch . " You still do n't believe it . " <P> Call It Talent . Parker 's crew is essentially the same one that was unbeaten last year until its loss to Philadelphia 's Vesper Boat Club in the Olympic trials . Now the Crimson is stronger , more mature , more confident . They average 6 ft. 3 in. and 180 lb. - including Coxswain John Unkovic , who stands 5 ft. 6 in. and weighs 120 lb. after dinner . Four of them-Captain and No. 6 Oar Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pollock , No. 2 Oar Bob Schwarz-have been in the same boat since their freshman year at Harvard . <P> In practice , they row 6 to 10 miles a day , smoothly and powerfully shifting the stroke from 20 to 32 beats per minute ; each man fitting himself to his boatmates . They may look like metronomes , but Coach Parker calls it " talent . " " They are always thinking and feeling what 's going on , " he says , " rather than being out there just slugging away at it . " <P> Tulips on Cedar . Parker knows what 's going on . He starred on Pennsylvania 's varsity from 1955 to ' 57 , then shifted to single sculls and in 1959 won the National championship and the Pan American Games gold medal , went all the way to the finals of Britain 's Henley regatta before losing . A few months later , Harvard offered him a job coaching its frosh , moved him up to the varsity in 1963 when Head Coach Harvey Love died . " This sport tends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined to try things out to see what works best . "
