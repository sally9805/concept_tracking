Derek Wraxton , a $28-a-week War Office clerk , was one of the most elusive spies in the annals of British intelligence . Though he lived stylishly at the Dorchester Hotel , bought a Rolls-Royce , a Jaguar and a string of race horses , it was not until he spent a two-month leave in Moscow that Colonel Barmitage , lean , monocled chief of intelligence , made the astute decision to have him shadowed .
