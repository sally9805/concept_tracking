By JAMES STEWART as told to Pete Martin Anyone I 'm introduced to is apt to remark , " Funny thing , Jim , the way you say your lines . Sounds as if you 're ad-libbing  --  you know , as if you 'd just thought of the words , instead of having memorized them . " I wish I could confirm these guesses , but the truth is , my so-called ad-lib technique is an illusion . I try to get my lines down cold so I wo n't have to make a conscious effort to remember them when the cameras arc rolling . Once I do that , I can toss off dialogue any old way . I never fish for a line . If I did , the camera would pick it up immediately . Any movie-goer can spot the wild and glassy look in the eye of an actor who does n't know what his next line should be . The camera is cruel . If it catches you with your lines down , the audience may not guess the truth , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use long pauses in his delivery , if his pauses mean something ; but he must n't pause to conceal a lapse of memory . That 's as bad as rattling through lines word-perfect , but with no change of pace , no emotion . The most unusual way of reading a line that I recall is the method adopted by Victor McLaglen  --  or forced on him  --  for his Oscar-winning performance in The Informer . Vic had trouble memorizing any lines at all , even simple ones . For his big scene in The Informer , he was supposed to answer a sudden accusation of treachery . He failed in trying to follow the script . John Ford , who was directing , let him flounder through a nervous ad lib  --  no prompting . Since Vic was playing a knucklehead anyhow , Ford thought his bumbling delivery would suit the part  --  and he was right . Everybody said Ford 's snap decision was a flash of genius . True enough , but the device was usable just that once . Groping for dialogue is appropriate only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read a line as there are players . Every actor has his own style , his own ( Continued on Page 55 ) conception of the " image " ? excuse the expression  --  that he wants to project . In my case , I feel that it 's been an advantage to have had , in almost every role I 've played during the past twenty-five years , what you might call audience sympathy . My characters win concern for my wellbeing , even my safety . As a result , audiences have pulled for me to succeed . That 's not to say an audience should feel confident that the hero is bound to win , no matter what . I would n't want to seem infallible on the screen . Instead , I 've always felt that the movie-goer should be able to identify himself with me ; if he 's liable to make mistakes , so am I. Then , if I blunder , he hopes that eventually come out all right . If I have created such an " image " ? oopst  --  of myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came slowly , Now I do n't fight it . Another impression 1 try to give : While the character I portray may express his convictions strongly , he 's never arrogant or domineering . No matter how many tricks an actor may have , no matter what miracles of make-up are wrought in his behalf , it 's my belief that he ca n't play the hero 's part without suggesting humility . Arrogance is for villains . If all this sounds as serious as a flooded basement , believe me , life in Hollywood has its lighter moments . Since my eyesight has always been good , I know that the fan magazines used to print stories calling me Hollywood 's Most Eligible Bachelor . It went on for years . My friend Eddie Lawrence of Metro 's publicity department has a thick file of Jimmy Stewart clippings , most of them " revealing " when was t going to get married and to whom , or whom I was going out with , and was it serious . Every time I took a girl to dinner the reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I reached California in 1935 until my marriage to Gloria McLean on August 9 , 1949 . There were stories headlined : Is THIS JIMMY STEWART 'S BIG ROMANCE ? OF , WHAT DOES JIMMY STEWART , HOLLYWOOD 'S MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR , THINK OF Gnus ? Kind friends have quoted such headlines to me , but I 've seldom bothered to read the stories . It 's no fun to read quoted interviews that never happened . But it seems that at least once I was trapped into uttering silly remarks on the subject of girls . When I went to Englapd with my wife in 1950 , to film Nevil Shute 's No Highway in the Sky , a newspaper girl nailed me . " Mr. Stewart , " she said , " you once signed a story listing your ten reasons for staying a bachelor . Obviously you 've changed your mind . Tell me why , - " That 's absolutely untrue , " I said . She handed me a clipping . The story was under my by-line , and sure enough it gave ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember giving the interview , in a moment of stupidity . So I told the reporter , " You 're right . have changed my mind . " Back in 1951 I ran across a magazine story in which the writer said that during my bachelor days I had a special attraction for aggressive Hollywood girls , supposedly because I was n't aggressive myself . The writer 's theory was that I just sat around and grinned and did nothing , thus inflaming the ladies in question . I remember one girl who was n't set afire by my lack of aggressiveness . While we were parked in front of her house one night , she said , " It 's such a lovely night that the trolls must be out . " 1 asked , " Where 'd they go , to the movies ? " The next day I repeated our conversation to Billy Grady . " I do n't understand her , " 1 said . Grady patiently explained that trolls were n't the people living next door ; they were supernatural beings , like pixies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grady said . Anyhow , that was the end of our dating . The fact is that the gossips did n't know whether I was aggressive with girls or nonaggressive or just using the phone . I did n't think it was anybody 's business . Now that I 'm solidly and happily married , I still do n't . But I 'll say this : 1 might have seemed elusive to some of those girls , but there were others who knew me as no sluggard in the romance department . I was unattached and part of an exciting profession in a place that swarmed with beautiful girls . Trolls , any-one ? A lot of drivel was printed in those days about how I would n't settle for a " Hollywood-type marriage . " I remember one story which began , " Jimmy Stewart is a solid , American type . He wants a marriage that will last . " My supposed objection to a " Hollywood marriage " was exaggerated , although I did think it would be tough to be married to a woman in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , possibly because the parties to two movie careers must live apart so much  --  she 's on location in Hawaii . he 's doing a film in Rome . Actors are not the only ones who wrestle with this problem . No matter what business a man is in. having a gadabout wife , a big clubwoman , let 's say , is no fun , if a wife is out clubbing three or four nights a week , if her husband keeps stumbling over meetings in his home and getting trapped in his wife 's crusades  --  well , it can be irritating . Of course there 's always the chance that the husband is to blame in some way . If that 's the case , he ought to locate a head shrinker and find out why he has forced his wife to become Madam Chairlady . My wife , Gloria , is not that type . She keeps busy doing a lot of things , but she does n't join clubs or head up drives to save the trumpeter swan . She loves to play bridge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bridge club . She enjoys active outdoor sports  --  not only golf but hunting and fishing too . More important , she 's a fine mother . Our children love her , respect her , look up to her . Gloria believes that managing a home and taking care of children is a worthwhile job . Others may think that homemaking has gone out of style , but Gloria does n't think so . An actress who makes a picture in Spain and promptly makes another in Borneo , has little time to be with her children or her husband . Yet a man and a woman who have a satisfactory 55 marriage want to be together all they can . If I were separated from Gloria for any length of time , I 'd be very unhappy . During my bachelor days , the only homemaking I knew was the brand provided by household help . When 1 first arrived in Hollywood , 1 shared a ranch-type house with John Swope and Hank Fonda . Some of the maids and cooks who worked for us might have qualified for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Emma . Trouble began when a stray cat had kittens in a toolshed behind the house . At first we felt a cozy domestic touch had been added . But our economy-size menagerie soon got out of hand . Cats descended on us in platoons , until we had thirty of them , all wild . Their favorite meeting place was our rooftop , where they stalked back and forth , snarling at us . Since they never snarled at George or Emma , we concluded that cats hate actors . It took us a long time to learn the truth , but one day we ran a check on our milk bill . Wow ! And the bills for meat and fish . Clang ! George and Emma were not only feeding our cats prime beef , red salmon and cream , they were also feeding any other Brentwood cats that dropped in . Hank called the SPCA to say we'Were hip-deep in cats , and how about it ? The man said , " Just catch the cats and put them in a box , and call back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like to be caught by actors who are tired of the dinner bills . We made a couple of passes at them , but all we got were scratches and ingratitude . Along came one of my cousins , a sophomore at Princeton , bringing a friend , to stay with us . To get their help , we poured on the flattery . " You boys can get rid of the cats ; you 're young , brilliant , imaginative . Think of something ! " Perhaps we laid it on too thick , because they began by catching one of the cats and dyeing it a Kelly green . It was their belief that throwing a green cat back among the others would frighten away the whole mob . Our cats did n't scare that easily . In the end , we simply had one green cat plus twenty-nine others wearing civvies . Finally all our cats became infested with lice , and we solved the problem by moving to another place . Pretty soon Fonda married . Swope and I moved to a place called Normandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batched it for a while , we moved to a house in Coldwater Canyon and acquired Ellen . When she was n't waxing the kitchen linoleum , Ellen took tap-dancing lessons . She wore her tap shoes in the house , so there was a constant clatter in the place . It was like living in a barrel factory . Ellen used to intercept and read the scripts sent to me by writers and hopeful producers . If she did n't like them , she 'd tell me , " They 're not for you . " All I needed was to be asked for a reading fee . But more than anything else , I remember Ellen 's invention of airplane salad . Knowing of my interest in airplanes , she came up with a cucumber fuselage , carrot wheels and celery wings . Her pride in this display was so evident that Swope and I choked it down like good boys . My next domestic seemed to think it was her mission in life to protect me from drunken friends and predatory females . With no prompting at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young ladies whom I was currently dating . If had an early call at the studio , and had rashly invited guests in the night before , she picked up their hats and coats at midnight and announced , " Twelve o'clock everybody . Beddy-bye . " She came to work for me a couple of years before I joined the Air Corps for World War IL and her name was Daisy Dooley. 56 With Daisy 's appearance I again had animal trouble , Norma Shearer gave me an English-setter pup named Boy . When brought him home . Daisy issued an ultimatum . " I wo n't have that dog in the house , " she said . " I do n't like dogs . I 'm allergic to dogs . if you want me to stay , get rid of it . " There was a shouting argument . which I won . The dog stayed , and did Daisy . For the next two months I had the dog and Daisy and her black looks . One night , arriving from work , I smelled something delicious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The meat 's for the dog , " said Daisy . ' For you there 's scrambled eggs . " On her next day off I entered her bedroom to leave a note and discovered Boy 's picture hanging on the wall . Daisy and Boy had become inseparable . Boy had a beautiful coat , and Daisy spent hours combing it . 1 was given to understand that 1 must n't bother my dog . He sat in the kitchen with Daisy . As a favor to me , Daisy would let Boy into the dining room for a few minutes . I was allowed to pat his head . Then she 'd say , " Come , Boy , " and he 'd run back to her . After I got Boy , my dad came to California to see me a couple of times , " It 's ridiculous , " he said , " to have this dog around the kitchen all the time . It would be much better for him to be out in the field hunting as he 's supposed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army I shipped Boy to dad 's home in Indiana , Pennsylvania . As a result , Daisy was quite cool to me when we parted . I was inducted into the armed services on March 22 , 1941 . Like so many others , I came out of World War 11 with no desire to describe at length what I had done , seen or felt . In the years when I was n't talking , a number of writers filled in the blanks to suit themselves . A year or two ago a Senate committee did so much talking about my experience as a flier , or a nonflier , that it 's time I said a few Wards . The only lottery I 've ever come close to winning was the drawing for the first draft before Pearl Harbor . My number was the 310th pulled out of General Hershey 's fish bowl . The doctor who gave me my first physical examination brushed me aside . " You 're too thin , Buddy , " he said , and there I was in 4-F . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding on , all for nothing . After that there were write-ups which Made me sound like a draft dodger . Lucky for me , the columnists said , that I worked for a studio with enough drag to keep me out of the service . When this hullabaloo started , I went to my draft board . " What can be done about my weight ? " I asked . " I 've got to do something . " " It 's simple , " I was told . " We just wo n't weigh you and we 'll put down any weight we want . " I never got on scales again in my Army career . The man went on to say that the standard weight charts were ridiculous . " Admiral Nelson would never have made the British Navy with a chart like ours . " When word got out that I had succeeded in getting drafted , M-G-M threw a cocktail party for me on the top floor Of Metro 's administration building . Everyone toasted me , and I made a stirring speech . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that by being here today , you 've done something I 'll never forget . I 'm afraid I ca n't say any more , because it 's a military secret . " Roz Russell kissed me , Lana Turner kissed me , Judy Garland kissed me , Joan Crawford kissed me , and wiping off their lipstick left my handkerchief covered with red splotches . I wrote each girl 's name under her splotch . Call roe sentimental , but I still have that handkerchief . The night before I was inducted , my friend Billy Grady gave me a going-away party at Franchot Tone 's home , which Billy had borrowed . Grady 's parties were invariably offbeat . This time he hung lighted red lanterns on trees and telephone poles to guide people to our blow-out . I got there so early that there were only seven or eight men on deck , and three or four girls . They were chatting in subdued tones . There was a general effect of stiffness and formality . Knowing Grady , I should have suspected a trick . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl in a very long evening dress . " Miss Jones , " he said , " you 're wanted on the telephone . " She got up and with great dignity walked across the room . As she passed , I could see that she did n't have any back to he dress at all . That kind of set the key for the rest of the evening . My induction papers said I was to board a street car at Santa Monica and Westwood Boulevard at seven A.M. When got there some University of Southern California boys were boarding the car . A crowd was cheering and singing , and-a couple of reporters were on hand to get my " reaction . " 1 did n't say anything clever . At the induction center a sergeant formed us into a column of twos and marched us across the street . As we turned the corner , I saw a truck carrying three newsreel cameramen and four still cameramen . That truck rolled beside me as 1 marched down the street , Flash bulbs popped . Movie cameras whirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys before that day was over . Our gaggle of inductees was shooed into a building and taken to an upper floor . There I obeyed an order to strip . Then came tests for a variety of diseases and disabilities . After that it was O.K. to dress again . A skinny guy is always glad to get back into his clothes when other guys with muscles are looking on . Our next move took us to the reception center at Fort MacArthur , twenty-five miles away . The newsreel boys were at the gate before we arrived and they followed me over to where a column was forming to march to the warehouse for our uniforms . After disappearing for a moment , the cameras showed up at the counter where uniforms were handed out . A soldier handed me my underwear . A cameraman snatched the underwear from me , handed it back to the soldier and told him to give it to me again . An old sergeant intervened . Handing me my socks , he said in pitying tones , " You poor bastard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined up again , But a lieutenant called me out of line , saying the newsreels wanted a shot of me in uniform . And would I say a few words for the sound track ? One of the cameramen said , " Let 's have a statement , Jimmy . Tell us how it is to be one of the boys and how it feels to give up your big salary for twenty-one dollars a month . " I choked back what I really wanted to say . I fixed my hat and tie and stood straight and said , as I remember it , " l 'm going to do my best to be useful as a soldier in the United States Army . " Somebody yelled to me to salute , and I tried to do it the way I 'd once been shown in a movie rehearsal . Iwas on my way to the barracks when a lieutenant ordered me to come with him to his office . He said , " As one who 's been in tins old Army a while , I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys , Stewart . Just be one of the boys . " was n't grateful for his suggestion . What did he think I 'd planned to do  --  take Metro 's make-up man with me to keep me looking pretty while I signed autographs for the Germans ? When I got back to my barracks , somebody showed me a newspaper story saying that while I was in the Army I 'd be getting 51000 a week from the studio  --  which was absolutely untrue . That kind of gossip made me feel discouraged , but the next day the sun broke through  --  I was given orders to report to Moffet Field , California . I was going into the Army Air Forces . The next morning , arriving at Moffet , I was assigned to a squadron right away . My quarters were in a tent with four other guys . It rained that day , and we stayed in our tent most of the time , just talking . Those boys were really thoughtful ; they did n't mention movies once . After a while a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the phone . I went to the dayroom , picked up the phone and said , " Private Stewart . " A. female voice at the other end of the line said , " I 've made a bet with someone ; that 's why I 'm calling . Why do n't you come out to dinner ? We can have a date , and I wo n't tell , so there 'll be no publicity . If you do n't accept , I 'll think you 've gone high-hat . You do n't want me to think that , do you ? After all , I 'm one of your public . You 'd better not get your public mad at you . " I did n't argue ; I just hung up . That day I was called to the telephone twenty more times . The sergeant was getting sore . I asked him to do me a favor ; unless it was my mother calling , please say I could n't be reached . He was back in ten minutes , saying , " Your mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In ten months I got my commission as a second lieutenant and my pilot 's wings , but in the meantime I had dropped into a mental and spiritual slump . I took a lot of three-day passes and went to L.A. and lived it up . During the week 1 did work on extension courses for my commission , but not too hard . Instead of concentrating on my books , I was concentrating on a blonde from Earl Carroll 's show in Hollywood . Then my family came West to see me . Dad came up to Moffet Field , and I showed him around . 1 had my car , so we left the post for dinner in a swank spot . After that we drove to Hollywood , and I took dad to the Inglewood Race Track . At one point we were poking around the dining rooms and cocktail lounges upstairs . You did n't have to wear a uniform when you were off the base , so 1 was wearing a sport jacket , flannel slacks and white shoes . An acquaintance came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you were in the Army ! ' That remark went through me like a blunt knife . I made some stupid reply , the man went away , and dad said , " I thought you were in the Army too , Jim . " He was ashamed of me . Suddenly I was ashamed too  --  and sore , because I knew dad was right to rebuke me . When 1 got back to camp , I began to really sweat for my commission . 1 finished the extension courses , and got some rides in a BT-13 trainer , so I could pass a flight check . 1 did pass , and my papers were sent in . On January 1 , 1942 , I was commissioned a second lieutenant . Expecting an immediate assignment to flight duty , I got instead orders to appear on a radio program at Stockton Field . So my first duty as an officer of the United States Army Air Forces was to make jokes with Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy on the radio . My second duty was to obey an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Birthday Ball . In fear of being overwhelmed by depression , 1 stayed drunk the whole time 1 was in Washington . But nothing could wipe out - my thoughts . What a pilot I am ! What an officer ! ! What an Army loan ! Returning to Moffet Field , I flew thirty hours in BT-I3 's ; then , in April , 1942 , I was transferred to Mather Field , California , where I went through flight-instructors ' school . In two months I was instructing in advanced trainers , AT-9's. 1 taught flying for four months , putting in three hundred hours of air time . Now , at last , I began to feel like an officer and a pilot . On July 1 , 1942 , at Mather , I made first lieutenant . Then it occurred to me that I might be stuck with instruction for the duration . I had started to hate American air bases . At one party I 'd heard an officer 's wife say she hoped the war would never end , because she and her husband had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kirtland Field , New Mexico , then to four-engine school at Hobbs , New Mexico . From there 1 went to Boise , Idaho , Continued on Page 58 ' I It It SATO k 11 A V I ? V N IN t ; ( Continued Jrant Pope 56 ) for four months as an instructor , and finally to Sioux City , Iowa , where I was put in command of a squadron of B-24 's . My group commander was Col. Robert Terrell . We went overseas in November of 1943 , through British Guiana and Natal , across to Dakar and up to Marrakech , and finally to my base in East Anglia . We were told to expect a ten-day briefing and orientation period before we began combat flying . Two days later somebody located me at squadron headquarters and said , " Fifteen reporters and newsreel cameramen are at the front gate of the base . They want you to come out so they can interview you and photograph you doing your duty as a squadron commander . " I felt like saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to my group commander . " Would it be all right , " I asked , " if I just got into an airplane and flew a training mission ? " He thought it was a good idea , so I took off . After that I was left alone , except for an incident a few weeks later . By that time we were flying missions . I 'd flown six or seven myself . We 'd lost some crews . One day , at my office in squadron headquarters , I was handed a sheaf of papers  --  one original document and a stack of " endorsements " by level after level of command . The original paper was a letter in an envelope addressed to " Captain ( ? ) James Stewart , Actor , U.S. Army Air Forces , care of The Dowager Queen Mary , Buckingham Palace , London , England . " The first endorsement was to the RAF , from the secretary at Buckingham Palace . " Her majesty has read the enclosed letter with interest and wonders why it was addressed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " We notice that this letter was sent in handwriting to a member of the American armed forces , addressed to Her Majesty , the Queen . Please answer by endorsement the reason for such a communication arriving at Buckingham Palace . " Each of the subsequent endorsements was more heated . When the sheaf of papers finally left the RAF and got to the United States 8th Air Force , the endorsers were writing , " For ( blank 's ) sake , what is this ? Why do we have to take care of a stupid letter sent to this ( blank ) Stewart , c/o the Dowager Queen Mary ? Is this ( blank ) the actor ? " When the whole bundle reached the 8th Air Force 's 2nd Division Headquarters , I was sent a directive . " You will reply immediately by endorsement and with full explanation of why this incredible thing has happened at this particular time , embarrassing the 8th Air Force and the United States . " The original letter was a fan letter from a woman in Kansas . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're getting along fine . I have two sons in the Pacific and since I did n't know how to contact you or where you were , I thought this would get to you . I see all of your pictures and I hope you come home safely and make some more . Yours truly , Bessie ... . " l forget her last name . in my endorsement I apologized to Her Majesty for any inconvenience I had caused her . I said that I had no explanation for the unfortunate occurrence , except that the letter received by Her Majesty was written by a movie fan . I added : " I do n't say you hare to be crazy to be a movie fan . but it helps . " I added , however , that Bessie obviously was n't crazy . If she had been . she could n't have written such a touching letter . After that , the problems which confronted me were military , The hardest decision I 've ever made was whether tolead 1500 bombers on to Germany or abort the AliSSIOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airplanes sometimes leave condensation trails behind them , man-made clouds triggered by the engine exhaust .

When the moment came for us to Form up and head for our targets , the clouds our 6000 engines had spewed out were so thick that flying formation was impossible . I had to abort the mission . Let me do a lap dissolve now , indicating the passage of years to 1959 , and the efforts by Sen. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine to balk my promotion to brigadier general in the United States Air Force Reserve . It can be no secret to newspaper readers that Senator Smith objected vigorously when my name came before the Armed Services Committee of the United States Senate . The promotion was approved , leaving me to wonder whether Senator Smith was mad at me personally . I do n't think she was . She was protesting against giving a movie actor an important rank because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to qualify for a star . I 'm not sure that the senator fully understood that nobody was expecting me to climb into a modern jet bomber and fly it . Anyone who knows that my next birthday will be my fifty-third will agree that jets have made the pace too hot for my slowing reflexes . I ca n't do the flying which will be required in the event of a third world war . Even before Senator Smith squared her jaw at me , I was in line for a more suitable M-Day assignment  --  deputy director of the Office of Information , Department of the Air Force .

Between wars we tend to forget our professional airmen , hoping subconsciously that well never need them . Some well-intentioned civilian groups even believe we can best avoid war by disarming . To these dreamers , our trained defenders symbolize something vaguely evil . Countering this attitude will be my M-Day job . But let 's play the flip side of this Stewart record and get back to Daisy Dooley , who 'd been so mad at me when I went away to war , because I 'd sent my dog  --  her dog  --  home to dad for the duration . Daisy was the first person who phoned me when I returned to California afterthe war . I hired her again and eventually introduced her to another dog , called Harvey . This pooch had been given to me in July , 1947 , when I was in New York pinch-hitting for Frank Fay in the hit play , Harvey . One night Liz Whitney , who used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's yours , " she said . " His name is Harvey . We 've had him down on our farm in Virginia trying to train him to hunt with a pack . He starts out with the other hounds and wails until they 're busy ; then he sneaks back and flops down in our kitchen . When he hears the pack returning , he sneaks out , waits behind a tree and comes panting in with them . A real faker . " Liz said that since the hound was no good at hunting , she figured he must have rabbit blood himself , so she 'd renamed him Harvey after the invisible rabbit in the play . What was 1 to do with Harvey ? I lived in a New York hotel . Since I did n't want to hire a dog sitter , I put Harvey into a crate and had him flown to California . When I got home at last , I found that Harvey was moping , in spite of Daisy 's loving care . Hounds like to roam and bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Harvey was miserable and he made me miserable . He was possibly the dumbest dog that ever lived . He did n't like me . He was only interested in eating , I taught him to sit up and beg for morsels of food , but his stupidity was easily demonstrated . If I moved his food backward over his head , he fell over on his back , He never learned . It was even worse with food l placed on a glass table . When he tried to get it , he banged his nose on the bottom of the glass . When I married , my wife Gloria owned a big police dog named Bellow . We left Bellow at home with Harvey while we went on our honeymoon . On our return , Bellow greeted us with healthy enthusiasm . Harvey stayed in the back yard , 59 sulking . I opened the door and called , " Harvey , come here ! " He made a dash inside , ran through my legs into the kitchen and whimpered for something to eat .

But I did n't learn much , because 1 was foolish enough later on to buy a thousand goats . I did n't need a thousand goats  --  who does ?

He wished he had spent his ten-lepton coin for caramels at the shop of Yannis , which smelled delectably of coffee and retsina and ouzo and goat's-milk cheese . The fortuneteller went away , but was still remembered when Nickos 's father received a letter . " It is from a village called Nets Yorki , " said his father . " Your Uncle Gregorios says they do not grow olive trees there , but that many people are rich in America . He sends money for your ticket . How would you like to go to Nea Yorki , Nicko ? " Is it far ? " asked the boy . " Is it as far away as Athens ? " " Much farther . America is across the ocean . " " Does America have a king and queen , father ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time by the people . " " And after I have been to America and seen the president , can I come back  --  back to Pakia ? " asked Nickos . His father smiled . " That 's as may be , " he said . " Perhaps if you work hard and save money . I may not be here , but your brother and sisters will be glad to see you . " N ickos 's eyes were shining , and a dream fluttered in his heart . " Someday I shall come back , " he promised . " Back to Pakia . " That year the olive harvest was not good . Nevertheless Nick os 's father managed to outfit his son for the United States , including shoes made by the village cobbler , with a wonderful built-in squeak , the first shoes Nickos had ever owned . Nickos kissed his three sisters good-by and embraced his father and brother , and cried a little . On the voyage to America he was seasick , but his dream sustained him . Someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something for Pakia . After Ellis Island , Nickos discovered that Nea Yorki was n't a village and that Uncle Gregorios was right  --  no olive trees grow on Manhattan . Soon Nea Yorki became New York , and Nickos became Nick . He had a job in The Gotham hotel , on Fifth Avenue , working in the pantry and seeing all manner of amazing dishes , the like of which a boy from a remote hillside in the Peloponnesus could never have imagined . Nick was still a long way from meeting kings and queens and millionaires , but with his dream in his pocket he was on his way . He was a quick boy with serious eyes , light hair and a small body full of cricketlike energy . After what seemed to him a long time in the pantry , his deftness and warm smile and his efforts to learn English won promotion . Now he was a bus boy , with the privilege of serving bread and butter , and filling glasses with ice water . Suddenly he was introduced to the splendid world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening dress , the weddings in private suites and the strange phenomenon called prohibition . Later , when he had conquered English , Nick began to achieve status as a waiter . He took orders with precision , he was always cheerfully polite ; he recognized guests , and guests recognized him . Mrs. Chapin , who wanted her toast browned on only one side , with a dab of catchup on her breakfast poached egg , got her poached egg with a dab of catchup and her toast browned on only one side . Colonel Fisher ( cavalary , retired ) knew that when he ordered an Old-Fashioned " without all that blasted fruit salad " he would receive from Nick a bourbon on the rocks : a double slug of whisky replacing the sliced pineapple , the wedge of orange and the maraschino cherry . Guests took to giving Nick telephone messages , which he delivered accurately  --  and with discretion . In those days the University Club , behind The Gotham on 54th Street , had no ladies ' dining room ; Nick became a consultant for stranded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bent on retrieving a husband , Nick saw President Hoover in the lobby . A Secret Service man barred the way , but Nick saw the member he was looking for , and the member saw him . ' ' He 's O.K. , " said the member . And then he took Nick by the arm and presented him to the President of the United States of America . " Mr. President , " he said , " this is my young friend , Nick-ofThe-Gotham . " By 1939 , when he became headwaiter of The Gotham  --  he is now the hotel 's official " host " and assistant to the manager  --  Nick had served Queen Marie and Princess Ileana of Romania , and the Queen of the Belgians . He had seen a young man called the Prince of Wales , and the same man five years later as the Duke of Windsor . He had waited on three Secretaries of State , including Charles Evans Hughes , who made a memorable buzz through his whiskers with minestrone , He had served ambassadors , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman from Tarrytown , New York . From John D. Rockefeller , Nick-thebus-boy received a shiny new dime . The boy from the Peloponnesus with the welcoming smile was now a contented American , doing well in a job he respected . He did not marry ; the hotel and its guests remained the center of his life . Nick was pleased when so many of the guests congratulated him on being promoted to headwaiter . Now they all caned him Nick-of-The-Gotham . So did taxi drivers on 55th Street . And the Irish policemen , spotting a nattily dressed little man on his way home after midnight , used to say , " Hi , Nick ! How 's tricks at The Gotham ? " It was pleasant to be an American . Nick was reminded of his dream of doing something for the village of Pakia every time he sent money to his three sisters , whose letters were harder and harder to read as the Greek language of his boyhood became overlaid with the idiom of Manhattan . The war that began in Greece in 1940 did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way from Fifth Avenue , and Greece was separated from the rest of Europe by the mountainous Balkans . True , Greeks were fighting Fascist Italians , but that was in Epirus , where Nick had never been , and the Greeks seemed to be doing well without him . And then , without warning , Hitler 's Germany attacked Greece in the spring of 1941 , with overwhelming force and equipment . Three weeks later the Nazis were in Athens ; they were invading the Peloponnesus . The king flew to Crete , to make a stand there with the British . In the Ncw York papers Nick read that Crete would be assaulted by paratroopers , who were massing on the plain south of Sparta . That was the plain of Molioi , the nearest flat land to the island of Crete . The village of Pakia overlooks that plain , and the first casualties were the olive trees , chopped down by Nazi soldiers to make a take-off strip for paratroopers . The next casualty was Pakia ; her sons hid behind rocks to snipe at the invaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick had no brother .
