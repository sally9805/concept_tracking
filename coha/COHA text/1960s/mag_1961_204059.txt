WALTER JOSEPH TUOHY <P> THE Chessie kitten , the sleepy mascot that has long graced the Chesapeake &; Ohio Railway 's letterheads and napkins , last week was sporting a Cheshire-cat grin . In one of the biggest , bitterest railroad stock duels in history , the Chessie bested the New York Central for control of the Baltimore &; Ohio . The president of the C. &; O. , sharp-faced , birdlike ( 5 ft. 6 in. , 125 lbs . ) Walter Tuohy , 59 , announced last week that 61% of the 3,100,000 shares of B. &; O. stock are now in the Chessie 's paws . For Tuohy , a railroadman with the farsightedness of the falcon he looks somewhat like , the stock acquisition is but the first step in a grand design to merge the two lines into the second largest U.S. railroad ( after the Pennsy ) . Such a merger might well lead to others and an entirely new system of Eastern railroads . Says Tuohy : " One hundred ten class one railroads are just too many . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and innovation , Tuohy has provided plenty of both ever since he became C. &; O. boss in 1948 . Coming from the coal business , Tuohy highballed into the Chessie with none of the one-track-tunnel vision that sometimes characterizes lifelong railroaders . When Tuohy took over , the economies of the diesel locomotive were already apparent . Since the C. &; O. is the nation 's largest soft-coal hauler , its old-line brass assumed that their customers would not stand for dieselization . Tuohy called in 50 coal operators , flatly told them the C. &; O. would have to get diesels to continue to give them cheap coal-carting service . The coalmen were convinced , and the railroad cut its operating costs $25 million a year . <P> Looking down the track , Tuohy realized that to maintain the Chessie 's enviable profit record ( it has missed only two dividends since 1899 , none under Tuohy ) , the line would have to diversify away from the dwindling coal industry . He put the line 's business-development department at full throttle to go out and bring new industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 50% of the C. &; O. 's business is general merchandise , v. 22% in 1948 . <P> Tuohy also looks off the tracks for ways of strengthening the C. &; O. With the United Mine Workers and nine coal producers and haulers , the C. &; O. has formed American Coal Shipping , Inc. to export coal . The railroad has gone into oil and gas ; last year its wells produced revenues of $1,000,000 . Tuohy even hopes some day the railroad will be permitted by law to expand into other kinds of transportation , e.g. , he engineered the C. &; O. purchase of $3,330,000 worth of convertible debentures in Slick Airways , Inc. , an airfreight and charter carrier . If the Government ever gives railroads a go-ahead into the airlines business , the C. &; O. will be ready .
