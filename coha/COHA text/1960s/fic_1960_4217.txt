If it " takes a thief to catch a thief " ... what does it take to catch a psi-gifted thief ? What do you hate and fear the most ? I know a girl who gags and throws up at the mere sight of a bird . Poor kid , when she was a barefoot moppet she stepped on a fledgling robin in the grass . She has n't gotten over the squish of it yet . Birds do n't trouble me . I can look at them all day . It takes snakes to give me the green shudders . I hate them . She was getting better at them , I decided . This was the fourth one since breakfast and the roughest-looking of the lot . It was a diamondback rattler , and lay coiled on the rug at my feet . I turned my swivel chair slowly back to my desk and riveted my eyes to the blotter . Snakes are ghastly things . But there was no future in letting them shake me up . I bent over in my swivel chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this rattler 's raised head . He struck at me , but late , and missed . The swipe I took at him should have swept him over , but he got his coils around me . When I heaved back up straight before my desk , he was as neatly wrapped around my forearm as a Western Union splice . Enough of his tail was free to make that buzz that means " Look out ! " About a foot of his business end stood up off my arm . His forked tongue flicked out over his horny lip , pink and dainty . " Now , vanish ! " I said to the snake . It did n't . Instead the door to my office opened , letting in a little more of the unmistakable smell of the hospital , as well as old Maragon , Grand Master of the Lodge . He was complaining and shaking a finger at me as he came toward my desk . He did n't jump more than a foot when he got a look at my arm . His shaggy gray eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted question . I would n't give the old goat the time of day . When I dead-panned him , he shrugged and lowered himself into the chair beside my desk . " Thought you hated snakes , Lefty , " he said . " A guy could get used to almost anything , Grand Master , " I said . " I found a cobra under my pillow when I rolled out of the sack this morning . A coral snake fell out of the folds of my towel when I went to take a shower . Somebody stashed a bushmaster here in my locker to meet me when I dressed for surgery . I 'm getting almost fond of snakes . " Maragon semaphored doubt by squeezing his eyebrows down in a scowl . " Even real snakes ? " he protested . " It 's the most artful hallucination I 've ever experienced , " I granted . " This snake has weight , a cold feel and a scratchy scaliness . This new witch of yours really knows her stuff . I just would have thought ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thought what , Lefty ? " " Oh , " I said . " That it was somehow beneath the dignity of the Grand Master to drag himself down here to the hospital just to add a little conviction to the hallucination . I mean , working up a big entrance , and all this pretense of your seeing a snake . " His smile was a little weary . " Try a lift , Lefty , " Maragon said . He had finally overplayed his hand . Hallucinations do n't respond to telekinesis -- there 's nothing there to lift . I fixed on the rattler 's crouching head and lifted . The TK jerked the S-shaped curve out of his neck . I could feel his coils fight my lift . At some moment there I must have gotten the point that this snake was real . I guess I was screaming and shaking it from me for five minutes after Maragon had unwrapped the coils from my arm . " All right . All right . All right , " I said to him , shaking my head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me sold . I 'll go to Nevada for you . " I 'd have gone clear to Hell to get away from that hallucinating witch he had working on me . I 'd gotten used to hallucinations -- but who can get used to the doubt that one of those dreadful visions is real ? I 'd had my lesson . * * * * * It served me right , of course . It had begun when Peno Rose had first visored me from Lake Tahoe . I had told him " No . " Too busy , much too busy , with TK surgery at Memorial Hospital . It did n't mean a thing to me that some cross-roader with plenty of TK was stealing the Sky Hi Club 's casino blind . But Peno had known me from my days on the Crap Patrol , and was n't much impressed that I 'd reached the thirty-third degree . He 'd gotten the Senior United States senator from Nevada to put heat on the Lodge . When Maragon first visored me on it , I simply refused to discuss it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had an obligation to the Lodge for my TK training , and there was no honorable way I could turn my back on it . The Grand Master is a patient , if deadly , old goat , and he came after me in person . I 'd just walked out of surgery , and was still in mask and gown . The surgeon who had done the cutting while I had put TK clamps on the inaccessible arteries was at my side , breathing a sigh of relief that the patient had n't died on the table . He 'd still die , I figured , but not on the table . I 'd felt the fluttery rasp of his heart muscle as it had strained against my lift . He did n't have too long . " Thank God for a dry field , " the scalpel surgeon said , politely holding out his left hand to me . I shook it with my left . That 's why I had n't done the cutting , too . There are n't any one-handed surgeons . My right arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Maragon had told me once that my TK powers were a pure case of compensation for a useless arm . The surgeon dropped my hand . " You 're the best , Wally Bupp , " he said . He 's too good a friend of mine to call me " Lefty " and remind me that I 'm a cripple . It was Maragon who did that . I had n't noticed him , but somebody gave me the grip , and I looked around . He was back against the wall , short , gray and square . I gave his ear lobe a TK tug in return , harder , perhaps , than was necessary , and nodded for him to follow both of us to my office . " We 'll have to talk about it , Lefty , " he said , as he closed the door against the smell of iodoform . " No , we do n't , " I said . " I do n't care who is losing how much money at Peno Rose 's Sky Hi Club . Right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuts , " I went on , nodding to the scalpel surgeon . " We just pulled one out of the fire . When does this come in second best to saving the skin of some tinhorn gambler ? " " Your Lodge obligations come first , " he said quietly . " We have a replacement for you here . Here 's your ticket for Lake Tahoe , " he added , holding out an envelope from a travel agency . " I 'm staying here , Maragon , " I said . " I 'm a TK surgeon . I 'm all through tipping dice . " " You may not find it practical , " he said , getting up to leave . Well , I had n't . Three snakes inside my head had made me a sucker for the real one on my arm . Maragon had made his point . I might have reached the thirty-third degree , but I was n't quite as big a shot as I thought I was . I could feel that rattler on my arm all the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , the Sky Hi Club was a trap . Peno had tried to kid the public with a classy decor . It was a darned good copy of a nineteenth century ranch house . At the gambling tables everything was free -- the liquor , the hors d'oeuvres , the entertainment . Everything , that is , but the gambling and the women . The casino was taking its cut . And the women -- or should I be so sure ? You paid for your drinks if you stood up to the long mahogany bar . I turned my back to the rattle of cocktail shakers and chink of glasses , one heel hooked over the replica brass rail , and took a long careful look at the crap tables . There was a job for me at one of them . I began to shut out the distractions of sight and sound . I wanted nothing to dull my PSI powers . A blond bombshell slithered down the bar and ground herself against my leg . " Wan na buy me a drink , honey ? " she gasped . I smuggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tops of her hose . A funny , stricken look replaced the erotic face she had made at me . She headed for dry dock . B-girls usually work in pairs , so I looked down toward the other end of the polished mahogany . Sure enough , there was the brunette , frowning as she tried to figure why the blond bomber had high-tailed it out of there . I shook my head at her and she let it lie . That should have cut out the last distraction . But no , I could see one more bimbo working her way through the laughing , drink-flushed crowd toward me . She had hair-colored hair , which was sort of out of character for a barroom hustler . I put plenty of TK on the heel of her right slipper , and she stepped right out of it . It might as well have been nailed to the floor . Nothing was going to discourage this one , I saw . I let her pick it off the floor , squeeze it back on her skinny foot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and stuck her nose up against mine . It was long , thin , and not a little red . " Billy Joe ! " she said , and sniffled loudly . " My darlin ' Billy ! " How near-sighted can you get ? I do n't think there 's such a thing as a case of mistaken identity around a guy like me . I did n't know her darlin ' Billy from Adam 's ox . But I 'd have bet a pretty we did n't look alike . " You 're wasting it , " I told her , looking out over the crap tables . " It 's new , and different . But I 'm not anybody 's darling . " A jerk of my head told her to move on . But she sniffled and stayed put . I gave up and started through the press of gamblers toward the Cashier 's cage . " Billy Joe ! " this hustler moaned behind me , clawing at my jacket . " I knew I 'd find you here . And I came sich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me go off again , darlin ' Billy ! " While I prefer to gamble for cash , I had reason while on a job for sticking to a known amount of chips . She stood there while I got a thousand dollars worth of ten-buck markers , looking at me with some kind of plea in her eyes . This again was not in the pattern . Most hustlers ca n't keep their eyes off your chips . She puppy-dogged behind me to the crap table I had decided needed my attention . It was crowded , but there 's always room for one more sucker . And still one more , for the sniffly girl with the hair-colored hair pressed in against my useless right arm when I elbowed my way in between the gamblers , directly across from the dealers . " Billy Joe ! " she said , just loud enough to hear over the chanting of the dealers and the excited chatter of the dice players . Billy Joe ! What a corn-ball routine ! * * * * * I took stock before beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty gamblers of both sexes pressed up against the green baize of the crap layout . Three stick-men in black aprons that marked them for dealers were working on the other side or the table . We had at least one dealer too many for the crowd . That screamed out loud the table was having trouble . Big gambling layouts know within minutes if a table is not making its vigorish . A Nevada crap layout , with moderately heavy play , should make six per cent of the amount gambled on every roll . That 's its vigorish -- its percentage . If the take falls below that , the suspicion is that the table is being taken to the cleaners by a crooked gambler , or " cross-roader . " The table I had picked was the only one in the Sky Hi Club 's casino with more than one stick-man working it . The girl sniffled , and her long skinny arm reached around behind me to snag a couple sandwiches the size of postage stamps from a waiter 's tray . She wolfed them down , wiping at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cambric . She 'd done it before , and plenty , for her nose was red and sore . She made cow-eyes at me . " Do n't say it , " I told her . " I 'm not your darlin ' Billy . " The dice were to my right -- I 'd get them after a couple more losers rolled . My unwanted hustler stood on that side of me , too . They never have any money of their own . I was n't about to give her any of mine . I wanted to lose some dough in a hurry . I started playing field numbers , and TK 'd the dice away from the field every time a gambler came out . Of course , I could have let the table 's six per cent vigorish take it away from me , but that would have taken longer . Even with losing on every roll , the dice got around to me before I had lost the nine hundred I had set out to drop . I put four chips on the " Do n't Pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my weak right arm , and got ready to come out . Sniffles seized me . " Do n't Billy Joe ! " she said suddenly . " You 'll lose ! " She pushed my chips across the line to the " Pass " side . That burned me up . " Get your hands off my chips , " I said , annoyed by bad gambling manners . Her face was all resignation and sadness . Well , not quite all . A lot of it was thin , red nose and buck teeth . " You 'll lose , darlin ' Billy , " she said . " Pull those chips back ! " I said . Her eyebrows shrugged , but she did as I told her . I came out , and tipped the dice to eleven . I kept the dice , but lost my chips , which is what I wanted . Throwing six more down on the " Do n't Pass " side , I rattled the ivories in my left hand . Tears began to roll down her unhealthy cheeks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Billy Joe ! Listen to me , darlin ' Billy ! You 'll lose ! " Her eyes rolled up toward the top of her head as I ignored her and came out . Sniffles gasped , " Hit 's a seven ! " Well , that 's the number I 'd tipped them to , but she called it before the dice stopped rolling . That left me thirteen chips . Half absent-mindedly , I put three of them on the " Pass " side of the line and tipped the dice to twelve . Mostly I was looking at this scarecrow beside me . " Box cars ! " one of the dealers called . " My future home . " But he was n't as quick as Sniffles . She had called the turn before the galloping dominoes had bounced from the backrail . The box cars cost me the dice . The next gambler blew on them , cursed , and rolled . I did n't bet , and spent the next couple rolls looking at her . * * * * * The girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't even know what it means . Courturiers have taught them all to be lean and hungry-looking . This chicken was underfed in a way that was n't stylish . They call it malnutrition . Her strapless gown did n't fit her , nor anybody within twenty pounds of her weight . She was all shoulder blades and collarbones . I suppose that a decent walk would have given her some charm -- most of these hustlers have a regular Swiss Movement . But this thing had a gait that tied in with the slack way her skirt hung across her pelvic bones and hollered " White Trash ! " at you . I was n't much flattered that she had tried to pick me up . People have a pretty accurate way of measuring their social station . And she thought she was what I 'd go for . Well , I guess I do n't look like so much , either . I 'd missed my share of meals when they might have put some height on me . My long , freckled face ends in a chin as sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about a cripple , even if my powerless right arm does n't exactly show . My days on the Crap Patrol came back to me . That 's where the Lodge had found me , down on my knees in an alley , making the spots come up my way without even knowing I could do it . And when they 'd convinced me I was really a TK , and started me on the training that finally led to the Thirty-third degree , they 'd put me right back in those alleys , and cheap hotel rooms , watching for some other unknowing TK tipping the dice his way . Did Sniffles have it ? She was n't tipping dice , exactly , but she sure was calling the turn . She was tall , as well as skinny , and our eyes were n't far apart . " Billy Joe , " she whispered above the racket of the gambler in the casino , putting her mouth close to my ear . " I told you , sugar . And now you lost . You lost ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well covered up her need for a bath . " There 's some left , " I told her . " Show me how . " She hugged my arm to her skinniness . That 's all any of the hustlers ever want -- to get their hands on your chips . They figure some of them will stick to their fingers . The gambler next to me had won a dollar bet without my help . He acted mighty glad for a win -- maybe it was a while since he 'd hit it . I decided to give him a run of luck . Now in charge of my chips , Sniffles called the turn on every roll . She was hot . It was n't just that she followed where the gambler next to me put his dough -- she was ahead of him on pushing out the chips on half the rolls . He quickly saw that my chips had stayed on the same side of the line each roll as his . He cursed me for a good luck mascot . " Stick with me , Lefty , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard lift under his heart , and then , ashamed of myself , quit it . He turned pale before I took it off him . " What 's the matter ? " I asked him , supporting his sagging elbow , still mad at myself for acting so childish . " Nothing , nothing , " he gasped , starting to recover . He 'd only been dying , that 's all . But it came in second-best compared to holding the dice . No point calling too much attention to him . I decided four passes were enough while he held the dice . What do you know , as he came out for the fifth time , Sniffles pulled my stack of chips to the " Do n't Pass " side of the line , while scraping at the chapped end of her skinny nose with the back of her free hand . Like every compulsive gambler I 've ever seen , the roller next to me was sure he was on a rampage . Four passes and he thought he had the dice licked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who plainly had the management of my chips . " No moah , " she said . " You 'll lose . " Of course he did . I TK 'd the one-two up . " Little Joe from Kokomo , " one of the stick-men called . They raked losing bets and paid winners with the speed of prestidigitators . " Roller keeps the dice , " the stick-man told my neighbor . The gambler cursed and threw the dice to the roller on his left . He spat blame at Sniffles for not riding with him . He was one big clot of crushed misery . After all , had n't he wanted to lose ? They all do . I could n't get very upset over his curses . So far he had lost one buck , net . And he 'd had some action . So much for gamblers . I kept control of the dice while each new gambler handled them . I was having a good night . Of course , by that time I had handled the dice , which always improves my TK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For all the perception I kept on the ivories , I could sense no other TK force at work , which after all was the whole reason for my gambling . The interesting note was the way Sniffles handled my chips . Sometimes more sure than others , she occasionally let a winning stack ride . On other rolls , she keened and chanted oddly to herself , eyes closed , and pinched down most of the stock . But she was never on the wrong side of the " Pass " line . I kept track , not wanting my stack to build up past the thousand with which I had started . Most of all , I watched the skinny gal dope the dice , sniffle and wipe the end of her nose . She was one homely sharecropper , that was a fact , but she had a nice feel for Lady Luck . Or for what I planned next . * * * * * Wanting to come out with an even thousand , I adjusted the size of her last bet . When I won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Sniffles did n't resist . She used the lull to grab a handful of sandwiches from another waiter 's tray . A gambler at the far end of the table came out , calling loudly to the dice . The cubes made the length of the table , bounced off the rail and came to a stop dead center , between me and the three stick-men in the black aprons . That 's the instant when every eye is on the dice , trying to read the spots . And that 's when the dice jumped straight up off the baize , a good six-inch hop into the air , and came down Snake Eyes , the old signal . Wow ! I 'd had it ! " TK ! " somebody yelled . He might as well have screamed , " Fire ! " the way that mob of gamblers scuttled away from the table . " No dice , " one of the dealers said automatically . He raked the hopping cubes sadly to him with his hoe-shaped dice-stick . I made a break for it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sniffles . But she had the sure-loser 's touch of slipping away from any authority . She vanished into the milling mob . My last glimpse had been of a skinny arm reaching up to pluck some more free hors d'oeuvres from a tray as she fled . I should have saved myself the trouble . They had a bouncer on each of my elbows before I had moved five feet . They carried more than dragged me into a private dining room behind the bar . It went along with the ersatz rustic decor of the rest of the Sky Hi Club . There was sawdust on the genuine wood floor , big brass spittoons and a life-sized oil-color of a reclining nude , done with meaty attention to detail , behind a small mahogany topped bar . Stacks of clean glasses vied for space with labeled bottles on the back-bar . One of the stick-men followed us into the room , taking his apron off as he closed the door behind him , shutting out the roaring clatter of the casino . " Cross-roader ! " he hissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I missed it . He slapped me hard across the face , saving his knuckles , but not doing my jaw a whole lot of good . I would have fallen clean over , but the bouncers were still tight on my elbows . " Wait ! " I tried to say , but he cuffed me with the other hand , harder , if that were possible . This is the moment when you have to stop and think . A Blackout is quite effective -- it 's hard to hit what you ca n't see . And there 's something mighty unnerving about being stricken suddenly blind . Oh , face it , I suppose the real reason I felt for the arteries supplying blood to his retinas was that so few TK 's can do it . I clamped down tight , and his lights went out . He cried out in fright , and both hands came groping up in front of him , his fingers trembling . " I 'm blind ! " he said , not able to believe it . He began to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his sap . " Try it , you gorilla , " I told him , wrenching around , now that I was free on his side . " Try it and I 'll rip the retinas off your eyeballs the way you 'd skin a peach ! " He recoiled as though I were a Puff Adder . The other bouncer let go of me , too . I skidded in the slippery sawdust , scared half to death , but got my back against a wall just as the stick-man who had slugged me lost his orientation completely and fell to his knees in the sawdust . It would be some minutes before his vision started dribbling back . * * * * * The click of the door latch broke the silence . One of the other stick-men eased himself in , holding the door only wide enough to squeeze past the jamb . Do n't give the suckers a peek at the seamy side . They might just take their money to the next clip joint down the street . He did n't look like the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps it was his nearly bald scalp , perhaps the thick , bookish glasses in heavy brown frames . " What 's that ? " he asked mildly , poking a finger at the dealer kneeling in the sawdust on the floor . My Blackout victim was reaching out , trying to find something he could use to raise himself to his feet . His face was frozen in a fierce , unseeing stare as he mentally screamed at his eyes to see , see , see ! " Blackout ! " one of the bouncers told the second stick-man in a muffled voice . Sharp eyes fired a quick , surprised look at me . " Well , " said the bald dealer . " Good evening , Brother . " I had a surge of relief . The strong-arm stuff was over . This was the casino 's TK . " What kept you , Brother ? " I said , sounding a little sore . " These characters were going to kick my teeth out . " His grin had a taste of viciousness . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How was I to know ? " He looked calmly at them over the tops of his glasses . " You can go now , " he said , like a schoolmarm dismissing class . The gorillas helped the blindly staring dealer to his feet , brushing at the sawdust that clung to his clothing , and had him presentable by the time they led him through the door . They seemed glad to get away . " The Blackout , " the TK said musingly to me . " You hear about it , and the Psiless cringe when they think it might happen to them . But you do n't see it every day . You 're in the Lodge , of course ? " he added . " Of course , " I said coldly . " Please , " he said , waving a hand at me . " Do n't take it so big . So am I. " From five feet apart we exchanged the grip , the tactile password impossible for the Psiless to duplicate -- just a light tug at each other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm Fowler Smythe , " he said . " Twenty-fifth degree , " he added , flexing his TK muscles . " What is it , buster ? You on Crap Patrol ? " I paused before I answered . Twenty-fifth degree ? Since when could a gambling casino afford a full-time Twenty-fifth ? TK 's in the upper degrees come high . I had already figured my fee at a hundred thousand a day , if I straightened out the casino 's losses to the cross-roader . " Wally Bupp , " I said at last , deciding there was no point to trying some cover identity . My gimpy right wing was a dead giveaway . " Thirty-third degree , " I added . He had a crooked grin , out of place beneath his scholarly glasses . " I 've heard of Wally Bupp , " he admitted . Well , he should have . There are n't so many Thirty-thirds hanging around . " And you are young , smug and snotty enough to play the part , " he concluded without heat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play-acting , with Barney going through the motions of being blind . You could be outside the Lodge , sonny . Any cross-roader who can tip dice the way you were working them can twitch an ear . Let 's see some credentials . " He scuffed through the sawdust to the bar and took a stack of silver dollars from his apron . He held them , dealerwise , in the palm of his hand , with his fingertips down , so that they were a column surrounded by a fence of fingers . " How many ? " he asked . I shrugged . " The whole stack , Smythe , " I told him . His eyebrows went halfway up his tall , tall forehead . But he put them all down on the bar top , about twenty-five silver dollars . " Show me , " I said . He ran his fingertips down the side of the stack of silver . Another tactile . Well , he certainly was n't much of a perceptive , or he would have been able to handle the Blackout himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some do that . The coins came up off the mahogany an inch or so , and made a solid smack when the lift broke and he dropped them back . Not very impressive work for a Twenty-fifth degree . The coins spilled over . * * * * * I used the excuse of straightening up the stack to get a touch , myself . I could have done it visually , of course , or I could have straightened them up with TK , but touch helps my grip . I took a good look at the door to the main casino , a heavy job of varnished native cedar . Just to show him , I turned my back on the bar , leaning against it with one foot on the brass rail . The lift was as clean as I 've ever managed . Anger , fear , any strong emotion , is a big help . They came up all together , staying in a stack , and I could perceive that they hung in the air behind me , a good foot clear of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the casino . In a smug show of control , I dealt the cartwheels off the top of the stack , one at a time , and fired them hard . Each one snapped away from the hovering stack , like a thrown discus . My perception was of the best . Each coin knifed into the soft cedar of the door , burying itself about halfway . My best sustained lift , I suppose is about two hundred times the weight of a silver dollar . But with the lift split by the need to keep the stack together , about twenty gees was all the shove I gave the cartwheels . Still , you might figure out how fast those cartwheels were traveling after moving twenty feet across the bar at an acceleration of twenty gees . Smythe gasped . I doubted he had ever seen better , even in the controlled conditions of Lodge Meeting . " A little something to remember me by , " I said , as I opened the silver-studded door . " Now let 's see the boss . " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you hit Barney 's eyes like that , he 's a Blind Tom for fair . " " Hardly , " I sniffed .

" Had I mentioned the rustic decor of the Sky Hi Club ? When Las Vegas had deteriorated to the point where it would turn most stomachs , the better clubs migrated up among the tall pines , along the shores of Lake Tahoe . And in place of the dated chromium glitter of Vegas , they had reached way back to the " Good old days " for styling . The Sky Hi Club was typical . The outside was all hand-hewn logs . The inside had a low , rough-beamed ceiling , and a sure-enough genuine wood floor . The planks were random-width , tree nailed to the joists . Even the help was dressed up like a lot of cow-pokes , whatever cow-pokes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peno Rose , who had used his political leverage to get me on the job , I had known since he 'd been a policy number runner on the lower East Side . His partner , Simonetti , was something else , but somehow I was n't looking forward to meeting him any more than I was to seeing Rose again . I guess it 's the filth within these croupier types that makes them surround themselves with the aseptic immaculacy of iridium and glass . Their office was in a penthouse perched on the slanting roof shakes of the casino . It was big as a squash court , and as high and as square . Every wall was glass . It could n't have been in greater contrast to the contrived hominess of the casino if they 'd thought about it for a year . Then , for the last twist , the furnishings were straight out of the old Southwest -- Navajo rugs , heavy , Spanish oak desks , and a pair of matching couches or divans of whole steer leather stretched over oak frames . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment Fowler Smythe showed me into the office , spurs jingling .

I 've seen sharks with a pleasanter gape . Naturally , I did n't take his hand . " Hi , Peno , " I said . He jerked his hand back and straightened up . He snapped the hole in his face shut . " My partner , " he said , waving his hand at the dark-skinned gent standing over against one of the fumed oak desks .

They watch too much TV . It makes terrible hams of them all . He spat on the floor . " A living doll , " I said . I took a better look at this honey . Face it , he was an oily snake , cleaned up as much as possible , but not enough . No amount of dude ranch duds , gold spurs or Indian jewelry could hide his stiletto mentality . He was just a Tenderloin hoodlum with some of the scum scraped off . Well , I should know . So was I. Simonetti finished licking the seam of his roach . He came forward as he lit it and blew too much smoke in my face . " What you doing here ? " he said in a husky voice . " I told Rose no dice . We need another TK like we need a hole in the head . " " You think I want to be in this trap ? " I snapped at him . " Say the word , Tex , and I 'm gone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Scram ! " I started for the door , glad to be rid of the lot of them . Peno Rose beat me to it . He showed me several rows of teeth , the way sharks will . " Half of this joint is mine , " he snarled , holding a hand lightly against my chest . He knew me better than to push . " My half is hiring you . " The whiff of garlic over my shoulder told me that Simonetti had followed me , too . He did n't have any reservations about grabbing me and twisting me around and giving me a real face-full . " If you know what 's good for you , you 'll get out of here . " " Freak ? " I said , laying it on his mitral valve . After his heart had missed about eight beats , he started to sink , and I quit the lift . " Be polite , Simonetti , " I said to the panic in his yellowish face . " Next time I 'll pinch down tight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He wanted his stiletto . He needed it . He was sorry he had ever quit carrying it . A couple seconds of reflection told him I was too tough for him . He went for his partner , his face darkening with rage now that his heart could get some blood to it . He had his hands out , for Rose 's throat , I guess . For my dough it took guts to put fingers that close to all those teeth . But he never got a chance to try it . An ashtray , one of those things with a shot-loaded cloth bag under it , flew off a desk , smacked him in the back of the head , and dropped to the floor with a thump . It was n't a hard blow , but an upsetting one . Fowler Smythe grinned at him from where he was sitting in one of the leather divans . " Sit down and shut up , Sime , " he suggested coolly . Simonetti sagged with defeat . " Look , Rose , " he gasped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be stopped by this creep Smythe . Now you drag in another TK . Buy me out ! " " What 's a business worth that 's losing its shirt ? " Rose sneered . " We were in clover , you fool , till this cross-roader got to us . This is our only chance to get even . " That finished Simonetti . He went back to his desk and slumped against it , scowling at the points of his handtooled boots . * * * * * Rose looked over at me . " Let 's make sense , " he said quietly . " We watched you on the TV monitor from the time you came in . " " Sure , " I said . " What about it ? " he demanded . I shrugged . " I had my way with the dice , Peno . I dropped nine yards as fast as I could , then won it back . The spots came up for me every single roll but two , when I had my eye on something else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " How about it , Fowler ? " I asked my Lodge Brother . " Was a worker tipping the dice tonight ? " " I never felt it , " he said . " But the table had dropped nearly forty grand during the shift , which was about over when you started to play . He 's too good for me , Wally . " " But you felt my lifts , " I protested . " You called ' TK ' on the table . " Smythe shrugged and took off his glasses . " I thought I felt you tipping when you first came to the layout , " he said , waving them around . I nodded confirmation . " But it was smooth work , and I could hardly be sure . Most of these maverick TK 's strong-arm the dice , and they skid across the layout with their spots up . You 're way ahead of that -- you do n't touch them till the final few tumbles . And then , you were losing , and I could n't see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the smart move . " I explained . " I was still controlling the dice , and if there 'd been a cross-roader working , I should have felt him skidding them . " Smythe nodded . " Of course , " he added . " I could feel you more clearly after you got the dice , and later , while that scarecrow with you was handling your chips . You were building a stack . So I fingered you . " " Careful , " I said sourly . " You 're talking about the woman I love . " There was a strained moment of silence , and then they all laughed . She 'd been a sight , all right . Simonetti came back alive with that one . His husky voice cut in on the laughter . " Where does that bag fit ? " he demanded . " No idea , " I said truthfully . " A random factor . I do n't think she fits . " " Something has to fit ! " he yelled in his oversized whisper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around from table to table ? " This was something . " The table you watch is the one that gets hit ? " I asked Smythe . He blushed , clear to the top of his bald head . " A subtle , nasty operator , " he said gruffly . " And he 's had the gall to stick it in me pretty badly , Wally . What Sime says is true . " Well , this we would n't stand for . I did n't give a care if every gambling house in Nevada went broke . But Smythe was in the Lodge . And it finally made sense that the Lodge had sent me to bail him out . I gave old Maragon my mental apology . The Grand Master would n't stand still for anybody 's making a fool out of the Lodge . Still : " Nobody that good is out of captivity , " I snapped . " I do n't believe it . It 's not TK that 's robbing you . " " Oh , ridiculous , " Rose said , showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't you think we could spot any of the ordinary kinds of cross-roading ? This is TK , and it has real voltage . We ca n't spot it . We 've got to have Psi power do it for us . " " Maybe , " I agreed . " But no TK can do it if Smythe ca n't . Have you tried a PC ? " Simonetti grabbed a piece of the heavens in rage . " No ! " he yelled in his loud whisper . " None of your crystal-ball witches in here ! " I knew how he felt . PC 's give me the colly-wobbles , too . " What 's the matter with precognition ? " I asked him . " If this crook has got you stuck , Rose is right . Only Psi force will get you out of this jam . If you know in advance where this operator is going to hit you , you can nail him . There 's a dozen techniques . " Peno Rose looked at me from under lowered brows . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " No , " I said shortly . The Lodge had proved that several times , in spite of my strong feelings that I had flashes of precognition . Why should I resent not having PC ? How many Psi personalities have more than one power ? Not many . And as for precognition , as Simonetti said , more than their fair share is possessed by wild-looking women . Like Sniffles , I thought suddenly . " Well , " Rose said , turning back to his partner . " Let Sime and me talk it over . Maybe we should get a PC . " " Nuts , " Simonetti told him . " I 'll think it over , too , " I said . " See you tomorrow . " I turned to go . Simonetti and Smythe followed me out , each for his own reasons , I guess , leaving Rose behind in the cube of glass on the roof , looking like he was going to turn belly-up and take a bite out of the PBX on his desk . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew somebody had his eye on me as I wandered about the crowded casino , looking for Sniffles . As far as I could make out , she had vamoosed without trying to hustle another sucker . Her percentage of my winnings had certainly been a disappointment to her . At last I went down the ersatz wooden steps into the neon-gashed night and started across the nearly deserted main drag toward the motel where I had registered . A powerful turbine howled as a car pulled away from the curb , perhaps a hundred yards up the way . His lights came on and snapped up to bright . I had a perfect flash of PC -- I do have moments of it , no matter what the Lodge thinks . The car was going to take a dive into the fountain pool in front of my motel . But it sure did n't act like it . I froze in the middle of the road , hearing rubber scream as the driver floored the throttle and hurled the automobile right at me . He might as well have been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of a six-lane boulevard , and could never make either curb before he ran me down . This is when it pays to be a perceptive . I 've talked to many TK 's about how they visualize their lifts . We all conceive of it differently . With me a real strain is like shining a bright beam of light on the spot you 're lifting . Be glad , Wally Bupp , I had time to tell myself . Be glad for a mechanical mind . Where do you lift four thousand pounds of car aimed right at you ? Well , there is a small valve , ca n't weigh half an ounce , lightly spring-loaded , that is in the power-steering mechanism . I seared a lift at it . You know what happened . The feedback of the power-steering wrenched the wheel from the driver 's hand -- it was ten times as strong as he was , dragging its power as it did from a four-hundred horsepower shaft turning 30,000 rpm . The car careened and skidded across the curb . It took out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still screaming rubber . The fountain went over with a crash and then the racket dwindled off in the shriek of twisted buckets . The turbine had gotten what for in the collision . I did n't hang around to see what had happened to the driver . He was just some heavy who had the job of rubbing me out . But I did seek another haven . If they knew me that well , I 'd never be safe where I had stashed my suitcase . There was a ' copter squatting at the Sky Hi 's ramp . I jumped for it and had him drop me toward the outskirts of the town of Lake Tahoe , and then walked a few blocks , mostly in circles to see if I were being followed , before darting into a fairly seedy motel a couple blocks off the main drag . My room was on the third floor of the flea-bag . Part of the place was only two stories high . The door at the end of my corridor opened out onto the roof . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cool of the desert night . * * * * * The gravel on the built-up roof crunched in the darkness under my feet as I walked cautiously to the parapet and looked over its edge to the hunk of desert that stretched away toward Reno , out behind the motel . The third story , behind me , cut off the neon glare from the Strip and left the place in inky darkness . There was silence and invisibility out behind the motel . Feeling a little creaky about falling a couple stories to the ground , I lay down on my back on the narrow parapet , with my hands behind my head to soften the concrete a little , and looked straight up into the night sky . A dawdling August Perseid scratched a thin mark of light across the blackness . I heard a coyote howl . This was desert . This was peace . The dice and chuck-a-luck seemed ten thousand miles away . I heard a sound . Gravel crunched dimly under another foot . Somebody had stepped invisibly onto the roof . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was flat on my back . Cautiously I turned my head toward the door I had come through . I could see the fuzzy redness of a cigarette in the dark . It brightened as the smoker took a drag . Then I heard the sniffle , and knew who it was . She stood there , apparently leaning against the wall behind her , silently , invisible but for the glow of her cigarette , and not moving her feet . " Hello , " I said at last . " Was n't sure you wanted to talk , " she said out of the dark . It shook me up . She certainly could n't see me . " How 'd you know I was here ? " I asked her . " I do n't know how . But I knew you would be . " That was n't what I had asked , exactly . She sniffled , and I could almost see the back of her hand swipe at the bead of moisture that kept forming at the tip of her skinny nose . Made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should in folks who are marked with a debility . It 's the old compensation story . Look at my weak right arm . What she had said about expecting to find me on the roof sounded like precognition . And she sniffled and sniffled . Maybe it was one more of those tied-in hysterical Psi weaknesses . " What are you doing out here ? " I asked her . " Resting , " she said wearily . " I just hit town today . " " And tired already ? " " I was broke , " she said . " Worked in a hotel laundry till dinner time to get eatin ' money . Hot work . But I swiped a nice dress to wear when I went looking for you , Billy Joe . " " Yeah , " I said , hiding my snicker over the dress . " Say , I wanted to thank you for handling my chips . I 'd have lost my shirt if I had n't let you show me how . I wanted to slip you a cut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured you should handle our money , Billy Joe , " she said . " Anyway , ca n't take money for my gift . " She had me shaking with excitement . " You have a gift ? " I said , trying to keep my voice calm . " Just some nights . Since I broke my vow , I 've lost most of my prophecy . My real gift is healing . Lost all of that , " she concluded , not bitterly . " God is punishing me . " Gravel crunched as she came slowly across the roof toward me . The fag end of her cigarette made a spinning arc in the night as she snapped it over the side of the roof . Now there was no way to see her at all . Perception is nice in the dark . I tracked her automatically . " What was the vow you broke ? " I said . She sighed , near me . " I divorced my husband , my own darlin ' Billy , " she said . " There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I thought I was her darlin ' Billy . Talk about Double-think ! " Will you miss never having a man again ? I mean , once you 've been a wife --  " I added , letting it drift off . " God has been good to me , " she said out of the dark . " He let me see my own future , that he would give me a husband again . " That was a curve . " Is n't that an even worse breaking of vows ? " I said . " I mean , if in God 's sight you 're still married to Billy Joe ? " " Would be , " she conceded from the black , now right next to me . " But He told me that the man I should seek would be Billy Joe -- hit 's a miracle worked for me . " Her voice lowered . " A miracle that come to pass tonight , my darlin ' Billy . " A shiver ran its fingers up my spine . She meant every word of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * I was n't in any mood to get married , and least of all to a seeress . Precognition is the least understood of the Psi powers , and the most erratic . But of all people , I could least afford to sneer at the power of Psi . For the first time , I guess , I realized the awful helplessness that comes over the Psiless when a TK invokes his telekinetic power . I wanted no part of the future this corn-fed oracle had conjured up . But it might be the only future I 'd ever have . I tried to recall her looks . Thinking about them , they really added up to no more than hysterical sniffles , not enough to eat , and the pathetic evidence that there had n't been any money for orthodonture . Fatten her up , straighten her teeth and -- Talk about religious rationalization ! I snapped out of it . Maybe she could call the turn of dice . But I 'd be damned if she could call the turn of people . Let her try me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet on the gravel of the root . " So tonight you found the husband God 's been going to give you ? " I asked . " Yes , " she said softly . " And I 'm the one ? " " Yes ! " " Not that again ! " I growled , grabbing her thin shoulders and shaking her . Her glasses bobbled on her nose . " I 'm not your darlin ' Billy , and you well know it . Admit it ! " She closed her lips over her buck teeth and sniffled . " I reckon not , " she said , raising her head and looking at me without flinching . " I lied to you . " " Why ? " " Kind of made me feel more decent about bein ' divorced . " I gave her a last shake for the lie . " Let 's have it , " I went after her . " How much of what you 've been feeding me is just window dressing ? " She shrugged , but stayed silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Billy Joe . " " And divorced ? " " Oh , darlin ' Billy , " she sighed . " I jest should n't never a done that . But I did , " she added . " Talk English , " I snapped . " This chitterlin 's and corn pone are just more window dressing , right ? " Her face was solemn behind the glasses . " When you are a smart girl , and you know the future , too , they hate you and try to hurt you , " she said . " They do n't seem to mind it so much if it comes from a piece of white trash that never could be ' no account . ' By the time I was twelve or so I had learned to act just a little stupid and corn-fed. " * * * * * This , her longest speech , she delivered in quiet , Neutral American , the speech that covers the great prairie states and is as near accentless and pure as American English ever is . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great many other things about her . But it added something very solid to her claims of prophecy . " All this , " I said . " Because you see the future ? " " Yes , Billy Joe . " " And this talk about losing your prophecy because of divorce was just that , talk ? " I insisted . Her mouth worked silently . " I talk like trash , and sometimes I start to think like it , " she confessed . " I even act like it . I 've tried not to see things acomin ' . But , " she added , drifting back into her Ozark lingo . " Always I knowed I was to find you . I knowed I was to go and search in spots of sin , for there you would be . And it kept getting stronger on me where to seek . This night I knew it was the time . I never got a dress and all before . " The chilly fingers touched me again . Still , what she was saying made some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I tried , feeling a trap slowly descending over me . She smiled at that . " I guess I put that punishment on myself for what I done , " she said . " Then you can still heal the sick ? " I asked . She shrugged . " I want you to try , " I added . " Not till I get a sign , " she said , moving uneasily . " I 'm to get a sign . " I waved my hands in disgust and turned away from her . " There had to be some fakery in it somewhere , " I said . " You could n't heal a hang-nail ! " " Not a fake ! " she said hotly . " I have healed the sick ! " " Do n't get uppity , " I said . " So have I. You see , " I told her . " I 'm a doctor . Not much of a one , " I admitted , pointing to my weak right arm . " I ca n't heal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Show me , " I said , turning on her . " Heal me ! " " I 'm to have a sign ! " she wailed . Well , she got one . I took her to my room , pointed at the dresser . One of the glasses on the tray beside a pitcher rose , floated into the bath and , after we had both heard the water run , came back through the air and tilted to trickle a few drops of water onto her head . Her words gave her away -- she was no mystic . She swung her eyes back to me : " TK ! " she gasped . She recoiled from me . She 'd had a viper to her bosom . " Heal me ! " I snapped at her . " You 've had your sign , and I 'm your darlin ' Billy . " " I got to find it , " she said desperately . " The weak place . " I flopped on the bed , stretched my arm out against the counterpane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on of hands . " If she were the real thing , I knew what it was -- perception at a level a TK ca n't match . The real healers feel the nerves themselves . I 'd been worked on before . The more hysterical healers , some really creepy witches , had given me some signs of relief , but none could ever find the real " weak place , " as she called it . She was mumbling to herself . I guess you could call it an incantation . I got a picture of a nubile waif , too freakish to fit where she 'd been raised . What had her Hegira been like ? In what frightful places had she found herself welcome ? From her talk , it could have been an Ozark backwater . I did n't want to know what backwoods crone had taught her some mnemonic rendition of the Devil 's Litany . Her hands passed up beyond my shoulder , to my neck . " It 's in yore haid , " she said . " In yore darlin ' haid ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she gasped . " Hit 's ahurtin ' me ! Hurtin ' , hurtin ' , and I 'm a draggin ' it off'n yuh ! " Her backwoods twang sharpened as she aped some contemporary witch . Hurt ? She did n't know what it meant . She fired a charge of thermite in my head , and it seared its way down my arm to my fingers . My right arm came off the bed and thrashed like a wounded snake . She wrestled it , climbed onto the bed , and held it down with her boney knees . Her fingers kneaded it , working some imaginary devil out through the fingertips , till the hurt was gone . * * * * * We sat close together on the edge of the bed at last , as I worked and moved my arm , one of us more in awe of what had happened than the other . It was weak -- with those flabby , unused muscles , it had to be . But I could move it , to any normal position . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jest small ailin ' . " " You 're a healer , all right , " I said . " And a prophetess , too , from what I saw at the dice table . You know what a Psi personality is ? " I asked her . " Say , what is your name , anyway ? " " Pheola , " she said . " Yes , I 've heard of them , " she said . " You 're one , " I told her . " You can heal many people . " She shook her head . " Only could do it because I love you , Billy Joe , " she said . " We 'll teach you , " I promised her . " Would you like to learn ? You 've heard of the Lodge , have n't you ? " " Lordy ! " she gasped . " You 're as good as in it , " I told her . " Now tell me , what am I going to do tomorrow morning ? " She got up and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do that ? " she said at length . " You are going to the bank , first thing . You 've got all that money . It 's thousand dollar bills ! And you 're writing on them . " She frowned at me , sniffling again . " Do I really see it ? " she asked . " Is that right ? " " I 'll make it right , " I said . " Come on , " I told her . " If we 're going to stay up all night , we need fuel . How long since you 've tackled a twenty-ounce sirloin ? " * * * * * The Lodge has unmentioned influence . No , Psi powers are n't a secret government . But what high official can afford to be at odds with us ? They know where the Lodge stands . A little while on the visor as the east pinked up got me what I wanted . Because of the three-hour time difference , the Washington brass got me carte blanche before banking hours at the Tahoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Working with the cashier , who had n't even taken time to shave after getting his orders from the Federal Reserve Bank , I went over their stock of thousand dollar bills , as Pheola had PC 'd I would , and marked down the edges of the stacks with grease pencil . Mostly I did it to make my grip firmer . When the time came , I could make that money jump . Pheola let me get her a cocktail dress in one of the women 's shops . The right dress helped , but more steaks would have helped even more . I 'll bet I put five pounds on her that day . She was one hungry ' cropper . Hungry and sniffly . We idled away the afternoon and waited until nearly midnight to go back to the Sky Hi Club . Action is about at its peak then , and if the cross-roader had been tipping dice again , as they suspected , they would have had time to notice which table was n't making its vigorish . Plain enough where they were having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table with Barney , the dealer I 'd hit with the Blackout . Their faces were sweating in the dry desert air . The table was being taken . " Now watch it , Pheola , " I said , as we squeezed into the crowd , opposite the dealers . " Almost anything can happen . I want to know the instant you get a feeling . You understand ? " She nodded and wiped at her drippy nose with a clean handkerchief . I 'd gotten her a dozen . There was the same old racket . The burnt out voice of a chanteuse , coming over the PA system from the dining room , tried to remember the sultry insouciance with which it had sung " Eadie was a Lady " in its youth . Waiters in dude-ranch getups swivel-hipped from table to table like wraithes through the mob of gamblers , trays of free drinks in their hands . This time Pheola did n't have the same greedy grab for the hors d'oeuvres . She 'd wrapped herself around a couple pounds of high-quality protein before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urging the dice with the same old calls , and the stick-men were chanting : " Coming out ! " " Five 's the point ! " " And seven ! The dice pass ! " and all the rest . The ivories had a way to go before they reached us . I gave Pheola a stack of ten-buck chips and let her bet , without making any effort to tip the dice . She still had it . She moved the chips back and forth from " Pass " to " Do n't Pass " and won at every roll . I could see Fowler Smythe begin to scowl as she let her winnings ride , building up a real stack . * * * * * Without warning she dragged down her winnings and leaned close to me , sniffling . " You 'll get all wet ! " I looked around , seeing a waiter near me . He had just served drinks to the rear , half of the table , to the gamblers nearest the dealers . His tray was still half-full . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the kind of thing that qualifies a TK for the Thirty-third degree . I heaved at the thousand-dollar bills I had had marked in the morning , without the faintest idea of where they were . The tray lurched in the waiter 's hand , throwing glasses to the floor . Most of them shattered when they struck the real wood planks , splashing whisky and mix on our legs . I looked across the table and grinned at Fowler Smythe . His scowl had an awful lot of forehead to work on . " What the devil ! " I could read his lips say over the racket . But Barney , the stick-man who 'd felt my Blackout , caught on a lot quicker . I was about to freeze him with a clamp on his thyroid . It 's just as effective as wrapping your fingers around the throat . But Pheola upset the apple cart . She grabbed my right arm , so newly powerful . " No , Billy Joe ! " she cried . " I do n't want to die ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shooting me ! " she gasped . Shoot ? With what ? I had one terrified moment -- what to lift ? What was aimed at her ? At the last possible moment I saw it . His crap-stick was a hollow tube , and he was raising it toward me , not toward Pheola . I 'd heard of things like that -- a gas-powered dart gun . Silent , and shooting a tiny needle with a nerve poison in grooves cut in its tip . I lifted , but half in panic . Fowler Smythe squeezed his trigger and the tiny dart leaped unseen across the crap layout . My lift had been way off -- it should have thrown the stick toward the ceiling , where no one would have been hurt . Instead it merely twitched the crap-stick , and the dart struck Pheola in the left hand . She screeched a little and grabbed at the needle-prick with her fingernails . You never know how much power there is in Psi until you use it without restraint . I threw the crowd back away from us with a lift that nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards of the floor before she could blink . She had only seconds to live unless I blocked all circulation to and from her arm . I found the spots in her armpit and lifted the veins and arteries into a complete block . A whiff of garlic told me that Simonetti had reached the table . He 'd been watching on the TV monitor , of course . He knelt down beside us . " A doctor , quick , " I said . " She 's been pinked with nerve poison . " " She 's gone , then , " he said huskily . " Who done it ? " " Fowler Smythe , " I said bitterly . " A snake within the Lodge . You might try to stop him . But your partner , Rose , is the real crook . Get the doc , then tie up Rose . " " She 's gone , " he insisted . " Nerve poison kills right now . " " He 's right , Billy Joe , " Pheola said softly . " I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Simonetti husked at me . I had enough left to hit him sharply over the temples with a lift . " A doctor . With antidote , " I snapped . He trotted away . " Darlin ' Billy ! " she said , and her heart stopped . She was dead . I picked her up in my arms and carried her to the same sawdust-strewn private dining room where I 'd given Barney the Blackout . I had to split the lift . The tourniquet was an absolute necessity , or more of the nerve poison would enter her system . But her heart could n't stop . The brain can only stand a few seconds of that . I had n't let it miss three beats . Even as I carried her from the casino , I lifted the main coronary muscle and started a ragged pumping , maybe forty beats a minute . Once in the smaller room I began artificial respiration with my mouth . The sawbones was there in three minutes . I guided the tip of his hypodermic into a vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood coursing through it . He depressed the piston , pumping the antidote into her bloodstream . Little by little I let up on the clamp on her wounded left arm , dribbling the poisoned blood into her system , so that the antidote could react with it gradually . She stayed unconscious . Then I felt it . Her heart muscle tugged back at my lift . It was struggling to beat on its own . I matched my lifts to its ragged impulses , feeling it steady to a normal seventy-two as the antidote took effect . Her eyes opened at last , and we stopped respiration . " Billy Joe ! " she smiled . She was back from the dead . * * * * * In an hour we had returned to the motel . She was as good as new , but badly shaken . " I still do n't know what happened , " she said . I shrugged . " Smoke screen , Pheola . Every time there 's a run of luck on a crap table , somebody yells ' TK ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's who are n't in the Lodge , and who figure to make a killing here and a killing there by tipping the dice . But any decent TK , even a Fowler Smythe , can spot them . " There was TK in this , but not tipping dice . Smythe is a skunk . He 's no Twenty-fifth , or he would n't have any need to go crooked . He saw a chance to make a killing . He suggested it to Rose , who fell for it and went along . Rose decided to steal Simonetti 's half of the business from his partner with Smythe 's help . It was no more complicated than smuggling thousand dollar bills off the table in false bottoms of trays that drinks were being served on . Smythe was using TK to lift the bills into those false bottoms , well screened by the trays from the TV monitors . Barney was in on it , of course . And after the joint had lost enough dough that way , Rose and Simonetti would have had to sell out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Smythe , using money Smythe had lifted off the tables . " The whole TK business was just a smoke screen to keep matters confused , " I concluded . " How come they dared send for a TK like you ? Why were n't they scared you 'd catch them , just like you did ? " " It took a little more than TK , " I reminded her . " TK is just a power , one more ability in life . It does n't make you God . Once in a while it gives you a little more vigorish than the other guy has , that 's all . And sometimes it 's not enough . " " But you had enough vigorish to catch them , " she pointed out . " In a way , " I said . " I told them TK was n't enough -- that it would take precognition . And I do n't have PC . I had to bring a PC with me . You , Pheola . That 's why I 'm alive . Smythe would have killed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorish ! " We rode the ' copter together to the airport . Old Grand Master Maragon would sneer out of the other side of his face when I brought Pheola to him . He could n't keep her from PC training . She had it . " Tell me , " I asked her . " Can you always tell what I 'm going to do next ? " " I reckon , " she said . " If I think hard about it . " " But you ca n't control what I 'm going to do next , can you ? " I grinned . " I wonder , " she said . " Never tried , yet . " " Oh , no ! " I groaned . She showed me her buck teeth in a smile . " I figger first you 'll have them straighten my teeth , " she said . " You 'd like a pretty wife . " " If it 's got to be , " I said weakly . " That would help . I just wish there was some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all . But I guess that 's the price you have to pay for that awful load of Psi power you have . " " Oh , that , " she said . " I ought to be over that by tomorrow . I hardly ever get a cold , darlin ' Billy , and when I do , I throw it off in a few days . " Well , I guess it 's a cinch I 'm no PC.
