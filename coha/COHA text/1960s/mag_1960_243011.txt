Late in 1958 , U.S. negotiators met with the Russians and British in Geneva , proposed a system for monitoring nuclear bomb tests based on a network of 180 control stations . The U.S. has been regretting the offer ever since . Only two months later , U.S. scientists exploded a small nuclear device beneath a mesa in Nevada , which proved that such explosions were far harder to detect than the U.S. had supposed . Difficulty is that the Russians have embraced the 180-station system as if they had thought of it themselves . For months they refused even to listen to the U.S. 's new evidence . And then , when they finally consented , they listened in stony disapproval . Last week , after three weeks of futile argument , U.S. and British scientists gave up trying to reach agreement with their Russian counterparts , and adjourned talks until Jan. 12 . <P> " Very disappointing , " said the U.S. State Department . Chief problem is in providing a system sensitive enough to distinguish nuclear shocks from normal small earthquakes , of which thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiators pointed out , the Nevada shot-a ig-kiloton explosion-would have been read as an earthquake , and therefore ruled out for inspection . New ammunition was a study made by the Rand Corp. , at the suggestion of Dr. Edward Teller , director of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Livermore , Calif . Rand mathematicians theorized that any underground explosion can be " decoupled " by placing it in a large enough cavity , and thus can defeat the detection network . If anybody cared enough to dig a cave 3,000 ft. down and 950 ft. in diameter-an excavating job equal to removing a mass of material equal in volume to the concrete in 42 Grand Coulee dams-it would muffle a 300-kiloton bomb so much that the explosion " might be made to appear seismically like one kiloton . This could not be distinguished by the Geneva seismic network from the thousands of natural earthquakes of this magnitude occurring every year . " Similarly muffled , an explosion of 100 kilotons might not be detected at all . <P> The Russians complained that the West was making " tendentious " use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence " in the 180-station control system . The U.S.-British position was that no control system at all might be better than one that lulled the West into an illusion of security , behind which its enemies might test on , the explosions muffled in huge caverns in the depths of Siberia , secret and undetectable.
