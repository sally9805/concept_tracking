Just nine months after the 14-nation Geneva Conference guaranteed Laotian neutrality , Laos last week tottered on the brink of civil war and once again threatened to drag the major powers into a bitter struggle . <P> For three weeks , the Red forces , reinforced by cadres of Viet Minh troop commanders , mortar specialists and artillery advisers from Communist North Viet Nam , had been nibbling away at neutralist positions around the 30-mile perimeter of the grassy , pool-table-flat Plaine des Jarres . Strategically placed in the center of Laos , the plain-named after the ancient stone burial jars still found in the area-controls the approaches to the rest of the country and is the primary access route to North Viet Nam . With the Plaine des Jarres in their hands , the Reds could solidify their hold on all of northern Laos . Last week this gloomy prospect was all but a fact , as 10,000 Red troops poured onto the plain , forcing the neutralists to its very edge . <P> Fleeing Neutralists . The week began with a desperate flight to the plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be possible to arrange a cease-fire between the Communist Pathet Lao and Neutralist Army Chief Kong Le . Things seemed cheery enough as the opposing leaders embraced and their troops exchanged cigarettes . But . as one neutralist put it , " we exchange cigarettes during the day and bullets at night . " All too true . Hardly had Souvanna departed when the truce abruptly collapsed . <P> No one knows who fired first , but all of a sudden the Pathet Lao was shooting , and the neutralists were running . On the dusty Plaine des Jarres airstrip , mothers breastfed dirty babies , and children sagged under the weight of parachute packs crammed with household belongings as they patiently waited for planes to evacuate them to the Laotian capital of Vientiane , 120 miles away . In his ramshackle , tin-roofed headquarters , guarded night and day by a patrolling platoon of tanks , Kong Le worked round the clock drawing up a battle plan , although weakened by a liver ailment and a serious sinus condition . <P> " This , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountaintops and through the passes girdling the plain , the Reds at last surrounded the six-mile-long plateau . From the heights , the Communists laid a mortar barrage on the airfield , Kong Le 's last remaining lifeline to Vientiane . With the airstrip inoperable , Kong Le was forced to rely on runners as his primary means of communication ; he had no choice but to pull together what was left of his shattered forces and move off the plain . <P> Pressure from Two Quarters . Kong Le 's retreat caused consternation in Vien tiane . With his left-right-center coalition fast coming unstuck , Premier Souvanna Phouma was fearful that Kong Le 's troops would join forces with a right-wing army just southwest of the Plaine des Jarres and launch a joint counterattack against the Reds that would surely precipitate civil war . Desperately he appealed to Britain and Russia , overseers of the Geneva agreement , for quick intervention to stop the Pathet Lao 's flagrant violations of the ceasefire . <P>                 @ @ @ @
