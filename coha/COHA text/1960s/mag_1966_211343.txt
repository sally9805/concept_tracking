If the U.S. is undergoing a cultural explosion , much of the noise is being made by the clatter of rising new arts centers . That does not mean , however , that the arts themselves are in step with construction or that audiences are in step with the arts . According to a massive three-year study published last week by the Twentieth Century Fund , * professional performances and audiences constitute a woefully weak link in the chain reaction . Items : <P> - Despite the rising affluence of Americans , expenditures on the performing arts grew only proportionately to the gross national product from 1932 to 1963 ; and between 1961 and 1963 , even that rate diminished . In 1963 Americans spent only $3.23 per capita on admissions to the theater , opera , concert and dance . <P> - Less than 5% of Americans attend a live professional performance in a typical season . They are younger , better educated ( 55% of the men went to graduate school ) , and twice as wealthy as the urban population as a whole . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more or less selfsupporting , the performing arts in the U.S. are running about $25 million in the red . The deficit climbs at a rate of 6% to 8% a year , will double by 1975 . <P> " In the performing arts , " the study unsurprisingly concludes , " financial crisis is a way of life . " This crisis , contrary to most notions , is not caused by bungling management , featherbedding stage unions , overpriced prima donnas or " ice " ( boxoffice funds sluiced away to scalpers ) ; such factors are only " peripheral , " according to William J. Baumol and William G. Bowen , the Princeton economists who wrote the report . The root problem is the built-in technological liability of the live performing arts . <P> In most of the U.S. economy , output per man-hour increases 21% annually , doubles every three decades . Live performance is not subject to labor-saving breakthroughs-it takes four musicians 40 minutes to play Beethoven 's String Quartet , No. 14 , just as it did when it was written in 1826 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto manufacturing are at least partially offset by productivity increases , matching raises in performers ' salaries , to say nothing of other production expenses , can only lead to higher costs . <P> If the public does not defray the costs in full at the box office , obviously the difference can be made up only through private philanthropy or Government grants . Figuring the iron law of live performance v. technology , the authors predict that even Broadway faces " grim " times without some sort of help . For the rest of the performing arts , adds the report , direct and vastly increased subsidization is essential . <P> But who should-or will-provide the support ? The authors themselves do not offer any substantive recommendation beyond pointing out that governments at all levels provide less than 4% in the way of subsidies ; the rest is contributed by corporate and private philanthropy . In a foreword to the report , Twentieth Century Fund Director August Heckscher reasons that the annual federal appropriations for the arts-$8.5 million-is " disproportionately low , will be quite hopelessly inadequate if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P>
