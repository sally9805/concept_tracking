txt Washington , July 14 ? Demands for a thoro investigation of the circumstances under which four officials of the Anheuser-Busch , Inc. , brewing company , and their wives contributed $10,000 to the Democratic President 's club were made in the House today . Rep. Charles E. Goodell R. , N. Y. said the contributions were made on last May 24 , and that on June 17 the justice department dropped an anti-trust suit against the company which had been pending si n'T Jan. 31 , 1962 . " In the light of this information about the President 's club , the sequence of events which I have outlined raises serious ethical questions in the mind of , any reasonable person , " Goodell told the House . Assured by Katzenbach He said he had been assured by Atty . Gen. Nicholas Katzenbach and Donald F. Turner , assistant attorney general in charge of the anti-trust division , that the decision to drop the case was based solely on the merits of the case . He said he has great respect for the personal integrity of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong doing . But , Goodell went on , assuming competent justice department attorneys determined independently that the case against Anheuser-Busch should be dropped , questions outside the justice department remain unanswered . No Prior Contributions " What contacts , if any , during this critical period were made by Democratic national committee personnel with Anheuser - Busch officials ? " he asked . " Was reference made in such conversations to the pending anti-trust suit ? Why did top executives of AnheuserBusch , and their families , suddenly and simultaneously , as manna from above , drop $10,000 into the President 's club ? These questions should be speedily and fully answered . " Goodell said $4,000 was contributed by August A. Busch Jr. , company president , and his wife . He said August A. Busch III , vice president and his wife ; Richard Meyer , executive vice , president and his wife ; and Alfred Fleishman , public relations official and his wife , contributed $1,000 each . He said reports made by the President 's club to the clerk of the House reveal no contributions by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement that the justice department , " including me , decided the case like all other cases on merit alone . " He - said that aside from discussions with at . torneys for the company " No one from outside the department attempted to influence the decision or even discuss it with us . " " Not Kind to Bribe " Rep. Leonor K. Sullivan D. , Mo. , whose district ' is in St. Louis , told the House that August A. Busch Jr . " is not the kind of business man who is trying to bribe his way into governmental favor . " " I resent any implications of underhandedness , just as I re . sent an attempt to connect a contribution to the Democratic party as automatically being tainted , " she said . Mrs. Sullivan said that if $1,000 or $10,000 or any amount contributed to the Democratic party could buy immunity for any firm from anti-trust action " we would have en our hands a monumental scandal deserving of a congressional investiration . " Hints at Smear She said she would be inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed as much as $1,000 to either party in the last 14 years list every governmental action in which his firm is involved and " where the contribution could conceivably be regarded as a possible bribe . " But , she went en , if the Republican leadership is " basing this whole thing on the An ' heuser-Busch case , then I think it is a case of using honest reporting of political contributions in order to smear a Democrat who has made an honest above-board , fully-reported , out in the open contribution . " Rep. Thomas B. Curtis R. , Mo. , who also represents a St. Louis district , said he has a high regard for the . AnheuserBusch people and that for their sake there should be a real , not a perfunctory investigation . Curtis said he talked with Anheuser-Busch officials this morning and was told by them that the government dropped the 4-year-old case after the court issued a pre-emptory order that the government prosecute it immediately or drop it . He said the brewery officials told him they would be pleased to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It would appear that the government had a very poor case , " Curtis said . He added that an investigation would probably show that it was not a case " of bribery , but of sandbagging . " Curtis told reporters later that " there is an awful odor in Washington " because the administration treats such matters in a perfunctory manner . He said the House administration subcommittee which is considering election reform bills should be able to use the information and an investigation of the case would develop . Mrs. Sullivan introduced another facet in the case when she told the House there were rumors about the AnheuserBusch airplane being used to fly Vice President Humphrey to the all-star baseball game in St. Louis last Tuesday . Tells of Invitation She said Humphrey had been invited to close the St. Louis bicentennial celebration by tossing out the ball at the game , and that Busch , chairman of the bicentennial corporation , placed the comp a n y plane at Humphrey 's disposal because ' of the air line strike . Mrs. Sullivan said Busch did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Vice President 's party , nor did he suggest anyone who would be in the party . That started rumors that Turner , the anti - trust division chief , was in Humphrey 's party , and Turner quickly con - firmed that he did fly on the brewery company plane . " I received a very nice invitation from the Vice President several weeks ago , " Turner told a reporter . " He apparently knew that I am a baseball fan . I went along and I took my son , Paul , who is a bigger fan than I , with me. "
