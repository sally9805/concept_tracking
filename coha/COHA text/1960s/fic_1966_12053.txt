Nonrealistic . Sets are painted white . But incautious dashes of pastels suggest a banal attempt at differentiation between the areas . The lights are glaring as if harsh morning sunlight is streaming through curtainless panes . Platforms on varying levels imply a very small one-bedroom apartment . Each area has some identifying furniture or fixture : the kitchen has a stove , cabinet or chrome and plastic table ; the bathroom has part of the toilet stool or tub showing ; the living room has a couch and some chairs ; the dining area , etc . A sense of limited space must be conveyed , even causing the actors to stumble over objects . The lower levels suggest a hallway on the bottommost leading to the street and a stairway and various landings connecting the separate levels . Upstairs , the platforms are crowded with boxes , filled to overflowing and tied . Chairs are stacked in corners , around tables and stands , and among piles of movables . A television chassis sits empty in one of the rooms , gaping and hollow , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a squatting cyclops . A calendar of a cowgirl , in only holsters and spurs , her crimson nails clashing with the flash of her silver pistols , takes aim , hanging from the wall above the television . This room is splashed with pink , with white baseboards slicing the pastel smudges of the walls into rough rectangular shapes . The end of a scruffy white rug points out of the bathroom , rolled and tied by rope . SISTER sits upon the couch in the living room . Her sandy hair is tied by a bandanna and the blue Levis are faded dull . SHE wears an overlarge sweat shirt . SHE is a plump girl about twenty . Her actions are anxious . THE HELPER enters from below and climbs the stairs , stands before the imaginary door to the apartment and checks an address on a small white sheet of paper . HE pockets the note and knocks : knocking sounds from offstage as SISTER jumps slightly and bolts for the door . SISTER ( Opens door to a slit and peers through the crack ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuts the door , unfastens the night chain with a false clatter , snaps the lock back and pulls open the door for him to enter . The sounds are heard clearly from offstage ) My husband ai n't here now ; he 's gone to rent a trailer and car . My daddy and him will be back directly and they can help us . ( SHE leads him into the front room . Gestures toward couch ) Have a seat , wo n't you ? ( HE sits . SHE sits in a chair across the room from him , out of the sunlight . THEY sit a minute , then SHE stands abruptly ) Would you like some coffee ? p. 3 HELPER Yes , black , please . ( Her chubby hands smooth down her sides , smoothing themselves against the bulges of her flesh . SHE walks into the kitchen ) SISTER ( From kitchen ) You sure you do n't want anything in your coffee ? ( THE HELPER does n't answer . In his seat HE sits in the sunlight . HE wipes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillows , scratching away crawling sensations ) SISTER ( Returns with cup and saucer ) Here you go . You sure you do n't want anything in it ? HELPER No , thank you . ( SHE returns to the kitchen and comes back shortly , clicking the cup upon her saucer . SHE takes her seat once more and smiles . HE sips his coffee , the steam and sun keeping his face moist ) SISTER Are you in school ? HELPER No , not now . SISTER Oh . . . I thought the employment office would send us a college boy . ( THE HELPER makes a loud noise sipping his coffee ) We asked for a college boy who needed some extra work . ( SHE quaffs her beverage down in deep gulps Finally , SHE stands looking warily at THE HELPER ) We 're going back up north . My husband and me . . . we 're going back to college in Oregon . p. 4 HELPER That 's nice . ( SHE walks past the couch , her floppy shirt brushing past him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks each way up the street . THE HELPER lays his cup and saucer upon the floor and stands ) SISTER ( Steps to center of the room ) You do n't have ta . . . HELPER ( Cutting , smiling ) That 's okay . I 'm a slow coffee drinker and I might as well begin . ( HE picks up one of the nearer cardboard boxes . SHE scurries to the hall door , her tennis shoes squealing upon the bare floor ) SISTER ( Relieved ) Well , if you want to start now I do n't see anything wrong with it . ( Opens door ) Here , let me show you where to put those things until my husband comes . ( Her topknot bobs and springs across the rag tying her head as SHE flounces down the stairs , leading THE HELPER to the entrance hall . Two wooden chairs set on each side of a table in the hall . Mirrors line the wall leading to the outside . As THE HELPER lowers the box HE looks at his reflection in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of his nose . From beyond his shoulder HE sees the girl 's eyes in the glass ) p. 5 SISTER ( Flustered as HE turns ) Well , I 'll open this outside door and get things ready for my dad and husband when they get here . ( SISTER opens the imaginary door to the outside , props it back with one of the chairs and goes off . Upstairs , THE HELPER enters the apartment and looks around . In a corner , beside a basket of newspaper-wrapped dishes , HE pulls out an upturned campaign sign , stick pointed at the ceiling , the upside-down candidate smiling lipless out of a dark blue background , his eyes bluer than the background ; all of the picture surrounded by a red , white and blue starred border . THE HELPER props the sign against the wall , lifts a box and turns for his trip below , leaving the poster grinning behind him . HE makes repeated trips , gradually filling the downstairs hallway with boxes , occasionally receiving aid from the girl who hurries in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back usually carrying two small items , such as glasses , plates or lamps , in each hand . MOTHER enters below and meets THE HELPER on one of his trips ) MOTHER Ahhh . . . here 's our little helper . ( MOTHER is stout . SHE wears a crimson silk Chinese coolie outfit ; large brass bracelets swing from her wrists , smaller loops pull her earlobes low ; tied about one puffed ankle is a golden chain with a knotted heart , and grass thongs upon her feet make shuffling sounds ) p. 6 SISTER ( Entering ) This is my mother . MOTHER ( Pointing ) Here , young man . You can put that box down there . ( SHE steps out of his path . To his bending rear ) That 's darling of you . SISTER ( To THE HELPER ) My husband and dad are out front hitching up the trailer . ( THE HELPER nods and starts up the stairs ) MOTHER Sister , it looks like you 've got a good start . ( Upstairs , THE HELPER surveys what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the stairs ) YOO HOO UP THERE ! SOMEONE WILL BE UP TO GIVE YOU A HAND WITH THE REST OF THOSE THINGS . ( SHE goes off . THE HELPER drinks the remainder of his coffee . A gangling MAN with glasses tilting on the edge of his nose enters below , wearing white coveralls with the insignia of an international airline , and climbs the stairs ) BUDDY ( Looking through the rooms ) You 've really got this place cleaned out . ( Lifting one end of a green table leaning against a wall ) Well , we might as well get the table-tennis equipment this trip . ( THEY move cautiously downstairs , elaborately guiding the large table around the phantom stairwells . MOTHER enters ) p. 7 MOTHER Ohhh . . . be careful , fellows . BUDDY We will , Mother . MOTHER But he careful , Buddy . You remember the awful jar that boy gave the piano last summer in Waikiki . BUDDY Yes , I remember , Mother White . ( SHE smiles at THE HELPER as THEY struggle around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HE crosses the last step ; her jewelry gives her a jangle ) MOTHER Oh , you both must be so tired to bring that thing down . ( SHE peers at THE HELPER 'S face . To THE HELPER ) Your sweating brings out such gorgeous tones in your skin . I had this houseboy in Kingston . . . he was simply darling . . . ( SHE speaks to him as HE wrestles with his end of the bulky table ) Buddy . . . take it right out to the trailer . ( With grunts the two MEN reach the bottom . MOTHER points , sweeping the swishing sleeves of her suit in a swirl toward the street ) Take it right out to the street , Buddy . BUDDY Yes , that 's where we 're going . ( SISTER enters , followed by DADDY ) SISTER Ohhh . . . you guys are really coming along swell ! p. 8 BUDDY Wo n't ya please move out of the way , honey ? DADDY What ya got there , Buddy ? BUDDY The table-tennis table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Herbert ? ( SISTER , DADDY and MOTHER block the hallway . BUDDY and THE HELPER drop the table and rest ) DADDY Of course we 'll have room , Matilda . SISTER ( Excited ) Mother , we got the biggest trailer made for cars . . . It 's so big ! MOTHER ( Superiorly ) I know , dear . . . but is it big enough ? DADDY Now , now , do n't you worry none about that , Mother . We 'll find a way . BUDDY But is it big enough , Mr. White ? SISTER ( Annoyed ) Of course it is , Buddy . Why . . . why . . . our trailer is painted orange and the very large twin doors in the rear are fastened back along the sides . DADDY ( informative ) It 's big enough for chairs and hassocks and picture frames and everything . p. 9 MOTHER ( Making up her mind ) Well . . . I see it is a very American trailer . . . SISTER ( Smugly ) Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To BUDDY ) Then you see , it 'll do ! BUDDY If you say so , Mr. White . DADDY ( Hearty ) Here , Buddy , bring that table out here ! ( DADDY 's neck is freckled red and brown and his paunch is solid . HE is dressed in gray industrial trousers , green plaid woodsman shirt , and brown crepe-soled shoes . HE squints incessantly and there are the indentations of glasses straddling his nose . SISTER and DADDY lead the two carrying the table off . MOTHER stands in the doorway , and when THE HELPER goes out HE steps upon her feet . SHE grimaces comically but in silence ) DADDY ( Off ) Where are the net and paddles ? SISTER ( Off ) We put them in a box . DADDY Good . . . never know when you might need them . p. 10 SISTER Slide it along the side , Buddy . . . Daddy . . . do n't you think he should put it up against the side ? ( Recovered , MOTHER gestures silently in the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feigning threatened disasters ) DADDY ( Off ) Yeah , slide it up that side next to them boxes , Buddy . SISTER Yeah , slide it up there , Buddy . MOTHER ( From doorway ) Be careful sliding it like that . . . you know something dreadful always happens when we move . DADDY That 's it . . . that 's it . . . good boy . ( BUDDY and THE HELPER come in and climb the stairs . SISTER and DADDY come in and begin carrying the boxes stacked in the hallway outside . MOTHER follows the two young men . SHE reaches the top as the two men begin lifting the fish tank ) MOTHER Oh , the little precious babies . . . do n't you dare frighten them . ( As BUDDY is taller , his end is higher than THE HELPER 's . Sliding along the top of the glass , the water reaches the edge and spills a puddle over the side before THEY balance the container ) p. 11 MOTHER Ohhhh , dear , I told you . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember , I got that aquarium in Hong Kong . BUDDY It 's okay , Mother . We have everything under control . MOTHER I know that , dear boy . But be careful . . . will you ? ( DADDY looks up as the two creep down the stairs trying not to tip the tank ) DADDY Damn , where are we going to put that thing ? SISTER We ca n't leave them , Dad . DADDY Yeah , yeah . . . I know . ( SISTER and DADDY lead the two movers outside . MOTHER follows behind but does n't leave the doorway ) MOTHER Now , put it some place where they 'll be safe . . . understand ? Safe ! DADDY ( Off ) Okay . . . okay . . . Matilda . . . just keep your pants on , will ya ? MOTHER ( Blustering ) Now do n't you dare talk to me in that manner , Herbert White ! SISTER Mother . . . Daddy . . . please . . . not here . BUDDY Wow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOTHER Ohhh . . . it 's splashing the water . DADDY Yeah . . . it 's fussin ' with the skirts of these awnings like they were petticoats . SISTER Daddy ! MOTHER Now watch your mouth , Herbert ! Do n't forget there are two white women in your presence . DADDY Shut up , Matilda ! How in the hell could I ever forget you . . . even if you let me . SISTER Daddy ! DADDY Buddy . Here . . . c'm on and put this thing in the car . Put it on the back seat there . SISTER But , Daddy . BUDDY I think it 'll go . DADDY Sure it will . MOTHER Are you sure that 's the correct place ? Remember . . . DADDY PUT IT THE HELL IN THERE , BUDDY , AND LET 'S GET THIS JOB FINISHED ! ( MOTHER stands exasperated with hands folded ) SISTER Put those boxes and bags and blankets around it . BUDDY Yeah . . . the cushions will protect it ! DADDY Good . . . now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUDDY Does n't look so good , does it , Mr. White . DADDY We 'll manage . Go on up and get the rest . Sister and me will move some of these things around . ( The two young men climb the stairs to the apartment . MOTHER follows ) MOTHER ( To THE HELPER as HE lifts the bird cage ) Now , take special care with Augustus ' cage . ( THE HELPER nods ) Keep it covered . Do n't let Augustus see your fingers or he 'll bite . I warn you . ( THE HELPER starts down ) Buddy , that 's right , take the dart board and the darts . . . . Do you want me to carry that bowling ball , dear ? BUDDY No , Mother , it 's not hard to carry with its special fabric carrying case . MOTHER Ohhh . . . good , boy . . . but it sure looks heavy . ( SISTER and DADDY meet THE HELPER at the bottom of the stairs and call up to BUDDY too late , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddy ! DADDY Now wait a minute , Sis . SISTER But , Daddy , we ca n't get any more in. p. 14 DADDY Yes , we can , girl . . . we just have to try and push a little harder , that 's all . BUDDY ( Reaching bottom ) Let me help you , Dad . ( THEY go off ; THE HELPER goes up the stairs for another load ) MOTHER Herbert , if you shove that crate I got in Delhi down to . . . ohhh . . . he 's gone . ( THE HELPER comes down with a rubber plant . Looking up ) You 're going along marvelously , fellow . SISTER ( Distressed ) Gee , I never knew we had so much . . . We 're the Beverly Hillbillies . . . Jesus , we 're the Beverly Hillbillies . . . the Beverly Hillbillies . . . MOTHER ( After THE HELPER passes ) Sister , does n't he have the most marvelous skin ? SISTER ( Disinterested , starting up the stairs ) Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . so . . . so African . . . Dear , let 's go . . . ( MOTHER looks around and finds SHE is alone , so goes up the stairs after SISTER . SISTER is in the bathroom , having shut the imaginary door , and pulls down her pants and sits on the toilet seat . MOTHER enters the bathroom ) p. 15 SISTER Mother , please . MOTHER Oh , stop complaining , dear . Remember , you 're still my baby . SISTER ( Angry ) Oh , Mother , please . MOTHER ( Continuing ) It 's just like yesterday when I was changing your diapers . Now I 'll be changing those of your children 's soon . . Sister ? . . . You 've been married two years . . . is there anything wrong ? I know that Buddy was n't the best choice you could make . . . your Daddy and I were very against it , if you 'll remember . . . SISTER ( Jumps up and pulls on her clothes ) Oh , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! ( SHE leaves . MOTHER dabs water from the faucet on her hands and follows ) MOTHER ( Cornering BUDDY at top of stairs ) Now , after the card tables , dear , I want you to get the rest of the potted plants . . . BUDDY Yes , Mother . SISTER ( To THE HELPER at the foot of the stairs ) Now there 's only the mattress and the bed springs left . . ( THE HELPER nods ) . . . and then the encyclopedias . . . p. 16 BUDDY Yes , Mother . SISTER . . . and the TV and chassis . . . ( THE HELPER nods ) MOTHER . . . and the golf bags . BUDDY Yes , Mother White . SISTER . . . and do n't forget the bathroom rug . . . ( THE HELPER nods ) . . . the clothes in the closets . . . ( HE tries to get past ) . . . and my bowling ball . . . My husband got his all ready . ( HE starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two young men begin carrying the last of the items down to the outside . DADDY , MOTHER and SISTER stand about and supervise . Finally , DADDY lifts the campaign poster and looks at it with worship , then reads the slogan ) DADDY ( Oratorically ) IN YOUR SOUL YOU 'RE SOLD ON HIM ! SISTER ( Breathless ) Amen ! MOTHER What a wonderful man . . . how sad . . . how sad . . . ( THE HELPER is busy finding a grip on the chassis . BUDDY comes up and watches him ) p. 17 DADDY ( To BUDDY ) There wo n't be room for the chassis . BUDDY Oh , it do n't matter anyhow , Dad . I got the set and can put it in any old chassis . DADDY Well , leave it down in the hall and me and Ma will come back this evening and take it over to our place . ( With a turn of his neck , the OLDER MAN looks about the room once more , then walks to the cowgirl calendar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , opposite the politician . Bowlegged , HE goose-steps from the room , down the stairs , holding the poster and calendar ahead of him like two banners . The movers continue their work . BUDDY and THE HELPER wrestle the box spring to the trailer ) MOTHER ( To them ) You boys sure did a good job . ( THE HELPER starts up again ) BUDDY We 're leaving the frame and the mattresses . . . it 's dirty . MOTHER But what will you sleep on , dear ? BUDDY Oh , I guess we 'll have to buy new ones , Mother White . ( Upstairs , THE HELPER looks through the rooms and closets for anything forgotten . HE finds SISTER in the bedroom changing her pants . HE stands in the doorway watching her for a while , her back to him ) p. 18 HELPER Is there anything else , Miss ? SISTER ( Furious ) WILL YOU PLEASE PARDON ME ! ( HE walks downstairs and finds BUDDY and the two older people in the hallway . BUDDY opens his wallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELPER ) HELPER Thanks . ( BUDDY nods . SISTER comes downstairs . Before THE HELPER turns to leave HE catches DADDY 's stare for the first time ) DADDY ( Saluting ) See you again , boy . ( THE HELPER smiles , nods , pocketing his money , and exits ) MOTHER He sure was nice . . . I wish more of our help was like that . SISTER ( Annoyed ) Mother ! BUDDY Yeah . . . he was pretty helpful . DADDY ( Looks balefully at his family ) Awww . . . if you kids want to think that . . . ( DADDY spits on the floor ) CURTAIN                                                                           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
