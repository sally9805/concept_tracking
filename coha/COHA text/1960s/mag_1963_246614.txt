IN basketball and in football , it is good practice to " double-team " a formidable opponent . In the less violent game of journalism , we often find it advantageous to double-team in covering the big stories of the week . <P> The cover story on Congressman Wilbur Mills , which William Bowen wrote , is an example of how we work . Mills is a familiar figure to our two congressional reporters , Neil MacNeil and Loye Miller . The problem was not the usual congressional one of trying to stop the fellow from talking or getting a simple answer to a simple question ; it was one of getting much at all from a reticent man who will speak candidly about taxes but does n't enjoy talking about himself . Furthermore , Mills is a discreet politician , not given to describing how he intends to play his hand . <P> MacNeil has known Mills for seven years , and so well that when he went around to interview one Congressman he was told , " What are you asking me about him for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has just finished a book about the House of Representatives and has worked on ten cover stories for TIME , provided most of the material on the power structure of the House and Mills 's role in it . <P> <P> It was Loye Miller who dug into the soil of Mills 's Arkansas , who interviewed Mills 's family and friends , looked over the Mills store , house and bank , and provided most of the biographical material . Miller 's last cover assignment was closer to home : gathering material for the Harry Byrd cover . Both reporters are second-generation journalists : MacNeil 's father was assistant managing editor of the New York Times , Miller 's the editor of the Knoxville News-Sentinel . <P> <P> ANOTHER case of double-teaming is our coverage of the Congo . <P> Correspondent Bill Smith journeyed from Kenya to Tshombe 's capitulating capital of Elisabethville to cover the U.N . armed operations there , to undergo the hospitality of the Leopold II ( which he nominates as the hotel most in need of improvement in 1963 ) , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by U.N . radio . Since the U.N . itself in New York was complaining that its own knowledge of what was going on was often twelve hours behind , it was n't easy . The embattled correspondents in Elisabethville at one point formally protested against the " censorship and duplicity " of the U.N . operation . On the other side of the Congo , Jon Randal covered events in the Congolese capital of Leopoldville , and was only in brief contact with Smith once , before a weak radio signal flickered out . <P> Such double-teaming was essential , because the Congo reality was rarely what it was being proclaimed elsewhere by interested parties .
