txt Houston , July 19 U - With its big descent engine sending shudders thru its fragile frame , the Apollo 11 moon lander drops lightly toward the moon 's surface , its commander delicately controling the flaming descent . Probes on the machine 's legs contact ' the surface and two lights in the cabin announce in white letters , " lunar contact . " . Men ' on Moon Neil A. Armstrong cuts the engine , and he and Col. Edwin E. Aldrin Jr . become the first men to arrive on the moon . That 's the scenario . There 's no time to look at the scenery . No time to cheer . No time for memorable speeches . Man 's first visit to another planet will begin with two hours of frantic preparations to leave . Like tourists unsure of their welcome , Armstrong and Aldrin will begin a countdown for take-off even before the engine that put them on themoon has cooled . " For the first two hours after touch-down , we have a very busy time verifying the integrity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . . we can not safely continue with the lunarsurface work and we can not safely return to lunar orbit . " This results , he said , in " a great deal of technical discussions about systems during a time when most people will be wondering , " Well , what does it look like out there ? ' " Gives Them the " Go " They carry the countdown almost to the point of ignition . If all still looks good , mission control will give them the " go " to stay . If there are problems , the crew will fire the ascent rocket and leave the moon with hardly a look at it . If they get the clearance to stay , the pair will stop working for the first time since their landing . They 'll doff their space helmets and gloves and take a lunch break . Then , while a view never before seen by man beckons Just outside , the flight plan calls for them to ignore it and go to sleep . " I 'm going to be surprised if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon , " Armstrong says . But the spacemen are ready if sleep comes hard , as they say it almost surely will . The astronauts said they 'll drug themselves to sleep with pills . Module Barely Comfortable Finding a place to sleep in the lunar module may be the ' toughest problem . The module was n't designed for comfort . There are no bunks , beds , or even tots . Two hours after ' Armstrong and Aldrin begin their , rest , Michael Collins , orbiting the moon alone in the Apollo 111 command module 69 miles above his colleagues , is also ' supposed to go to sleep . At 10 p. m . Sunday Chicago time the high point of the adventure begins . Working with difficulty in the cramped lunar module cabin , Armstrong and Aldrin help each other put on almost 200 pounds of equipment . This includes helmets , gloves , and the portable life support back pack that will feed them oxygen during their moon walk . Putting on this equipment in the small cabin , says the Apollo 11 commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most tiring , and certainly the most potential hazardous . . . . We view it with a great deal of caution . " At 1:12 a. m. , while his fellow Americans 250,000 miles away wait in darkness , Armstrong emerges from the moon lander into the blinding , undiluted light of the sun . He will begin man 's first visit to the moon by ingloriously backing out of the moon lander on his hands and knees . With Aldrin taking pictures with a sequence camera from the window , Armstrong starts down a ladder to the surface . He moves slowly , hampered by the bulk of the moon suit and its equipment . At the second ladder rung from the surface , he pulls a cord that opens a port in the side of the spacecraft . A television camera automatic . ally focuses on Armstrong and the ladder . Aldrin turns on the television transmission system . People the world over watch history happen . At about 1:20 ' a . Chicago time , Armstrong steps from the last rung to a foot pad on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , like a swimmer testing the water , be carefully places his left foot on the moon . The time is expected to be 1:21 a. m. , July 21 . Still gripping the . ladder , Armstrong then carefully brings his other foot to the surface and puts his whole weight down . Armstrong checks his balance . He takes a few steps to see if he can walk . He attaches a conveyor belt to the ladder . The other end is in the module . The astronaut then takes a long-handled scoop from a loop at his waist . Leaning over slightly , he picks up a scoop of lunar dust , puts it in a plastic bag , and stows it in a pocket on the left leg of his suit . Aldrin Makes Exit Aldrin connects a camera to the conveyor belt and Armstrong pulls it down to himself and mounts it on a bracket on his chest . Aldrin begins his tedious exit . Armstrong takes his picture . While Aldrin rests at the foot of the ladder , Armstrong walks to the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 feet away . He places the camera on a tripod and then points it around the lunar surface , giving home viewers a look at the terrain . The camera is then pointed at Aldrin who goes thru a series of arm , body , and foot movements , checking his ability to work on the surface . There 's no mention of it in the oficial flight plan , but at some point during this time Armstrong will plant an American flag on the moon , and leave a plaque and recording disc as reminders of the landing . Aldrin then moves to the work bench and erects a sample collection table , he also removes a solar wind ex , periment ? a sheet of alumninum on a stick  --  and abs its staff into the moon . ? Plant Laser Reflector Armstrong opens a rock box , or sample return container , and , using long-handled tools , starts picking up rocks and dirt . He places the moon material in plastic bags . On the side of the moon Lander away from the television camera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries them away from the spacecraft about 70 feet . They are a laser beam reflector and a seismic device . Aldrin and Armstrong then begin a documented gathering of moon rock . They take pictures of rocks before they touch them , describe the material , then scoop it up and place it in a bag . Thp bag is labeled and placed in a rock box . They also take a core sample and place it in the box . Their two hours and 40 minutes on the moon is drawing to a close . They collect as many samples as they can , and return to the moon ladder . Aldrin collects the solar wind experiment and puts it in a rock box . Aldrin starts up the moon lander ladder . Aldrin pulls cameras and rock boxes into the space cabin on the conveyor belt while Armstrong holds the belt taut . End of Moon Walk Armstrong dusts his feet and starts up the ladder . At about 4:42 a. m. the moon walk is over . Armstrong and Aldrin tidy up their space cabin , rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their portable life support pack and other equipment no longer needed . They close the hatch , check the moon Lander systems again , and then take off their helments and gloves . Their work day  --  man 's first on the moon ? is over . They eat dinner and then rest . At about 10:55 a. m. , Armstrong and Aldrin wake up . They eat a quick breakfast and get.ready to leave the moon . At 12:55 p. in. , Monday , 22 hours , 15 minutes after it began , the visit to the moon is over .
