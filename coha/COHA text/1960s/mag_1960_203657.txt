The collapse in the Congo spread last week from the army to the government . Cabinet ministers argued heatedly with each other on the streets of Leopoldville . Lanky Premier Patrice Lumumba could seldom be found . With long-suffering President Joseph Kasavubu in tow , he was busy flying from city to city trying to impose a semblance of order . <P> Who 's Master ? Their trip was an embarrassing failure . The authority of Lumumba 's central government extended no farther than the sound of his voice . As soon as he left a town or a province , power returned to whoever was strong enough and ruthless enough to wield it . At Elisabethville , capital of the secessionist province of Katanga , the plane was denied permission to land . A spokesman for the Katanga leader , Moise Tshombe , said that President Kasavubu was welcome , but " we refuse to let that other character set foot on Katangese soil . " When the two harassed leaders took off from Luluabourg and headed for Stanleyville , they never made it : a Belgian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic relations with Belgium , and the Belgian pilot turned the plane toward Leopoldville , where Ndjili Airport was in the hands of Belgian paratroops . <P> As the plane landed , the Belgians dutifully drew up an honor guard . Alighting , Lumumba stonily refused to review " enemy forces . " A Belgian officer said : " Our presence here is only to protect the whites . " Snapped Lumumba : " The whites need no protection , and we do not need your presence . " As the two Congolese leaders waited for another plane to take them to Stanleyville , they were surrounded by an angry crowd of Belgian Lumumba was cursed and spat upon . <P> " Why do n't you go see the women have been raped ? " shouted a white and punched Lumumba in the face . In best performance since he became Pre mier , Patrice Lumumba remained and unshaken . <P> Dark Hint . By midweek it seemed if every Cabinet minister was crying help from somewhere . The Deputy Pre mier asked tiny Ghana to send its army . Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was promptly disavowed by Lumumba , who had been off on one of his flights . Lu mumba instead asked the U.N . for help , and hinted darkly that unless he got it , the Congo would appeal to Communist China . No one in the Congolese government asked Belgium for anything , but Brussels moved swiftly in response to the cries of its beleaguered citizens . Para troops and commando units fanned out from the big Belgian military bases at Kamina and Kitona ; planeloads of home troops were rushed to the Congo from Belgium .
