The 30 prisoners , roped together in groups of five , filed last week into a dilapidated Seoul courtroom . In a wide plaza two blocks away , a sweltering crowd of 30,000 grim-faced Koreans listened to the proceedings over loudspeakers set up for their benefit . Cordons of police and barriers of barbed wire kept the vengeful crowd away from the courtroom itself . <P> The judge asked the first defendant his name . " Choi In Kyu . " Age ? " Forty-two . " Occupation ? " Unemployed . " Assets ? Choi answered : " Since the mobs of demonstrators burned down my house last April , I now possess properties worth only from $40,000 to $60,000 . " To the listening Koreans , Choi In Kyu needed no introduction . As Home Minister in ex-President Syngman Rhee 's Cabinet , U.S.-educated Choi had controlled the much-feared Korean national police .

Choi pleaded guilty to five charges , admitting that he had ordered ballot boxes stuffed with up to 40% of the total expected vote even before the polls opened , had local officials throw out any poll watchers sent by the opposition party , and had directed the rigging of the final count . <P> Choi and his co-defendants expected little mercy from the judges and prosecutors they faced . As former Rhee appointees , the jurists are eager to channel public hatred away from themselves and onto the prisoners . Since violation of the election laws is punishable by a maximum of only five years at hard labor , the caretaker Huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with violating the National Security Law by " attempting to form an unconstitutional government through illegal elections " -a law which , ironically , Rhee had designed as a club to intimidate his own opponents . The maximum penalty : death .
