Prosperous West Germany seems to be on its way to overtaking the U.S. as the world 's leading exporter , but the prospect does not make Chancellor Ludwig Erhard very happy . In fact , he was downright grim when his economics ministry reported to him that Bonn 's trade surplus for 1964 's first two months was running at a staggering annual rate of $2.4 billion . Erhard sees the pile-up of export-earned foreign exchange as another spur to inflation , which is already getting a push from a huge in flux of foreign capital ( $725 million in 1963 ) attracted by the high yields of German securities . Last week , determined to try and keep Germany an island of relative stability in the rising sea of European inflation , Erhard ordered drastic measures to curb foreign investment . <P> He sent to Parliament a bill that would slap a 25% tax on the yield of German bonds held by foreigners . The tax , which will , in effect , lower the cur rent 6% yield on German securities to an unglamorous 4.5% , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond brokers . Erhard also an nounced a second bill that will please businessmen more ; by abolishing the much disliked 2.5% tax on the issue of stocks and bonds floated in Germany , it aims to encourage foreign companies to raise funds in Germany , thus stepping up the export of German capital and lessening inflationary pressure at home . <P> In his days as economics minister , Erhard often managed to ward off price increases in Germany by lowering tariffs to admit lower-priced goods from Italy and France . This strategy is no longer effective . Inflation in both countries has made their goods less attractive in Germany and has helped increase German exports by making them more competitive around the world .
