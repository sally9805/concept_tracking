 | COVER GIRL Jean Shrimp ton The very private thoughts of a very public figure @# " Clothes do n't interest me at all . I 'm lazy , I just put on whatever 's at the end of the bed . . . . " I 've got this scraggly hair , and bags under my eyes , and large feet and hands and things .. . . " I 'm flippin ' bored with myself . I 'd give it all up for a good marriage ? really that 's the only thing , is n't it ? " Who 's talking ? The girl next door , who 's been working for six years , who 's nearly twenty-five , and whose mother is anxious to see her settle down and raise a family ? Well , yes , in a way . But the girl 's name is Jean Shrimpton , and she is the most successful and highest-paid model of our time . She is also ? despite a 17-year-old challenger known as Twiggy ? the reigning queen of the British fashion world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different magazine covers* has made her face familiar around the globe . It is a face that can now command some $600 a day . Beauty , talent , money , fame , career ? she 's got everything , has n't she ? Well , nearly everything ? including enough shrewd intelligence to see what 's still missing from her apparently star-spangled life . " I 'm fed up with myself , " she said when I went to see her at the little Early-Victorian London house she 's just moved into . " I 've been modeling now for six years and , frankly , I 'm quite bored with it . It 's like being a puppet ? nothing creative that you can be proud of . Now I 've just made my first film , Privilege . You see , it had to be that ? either make a film or get married ; one ca n't stand still . I do n't feel I 'm ready for marriage , not yet . But I do n't think I 'm much of an actress , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat curled up in a purple and blue caftan-style bathrobe with her hair hanging down over her grave , marvelously sculptured face , and talked in her childish fluting voice as though we 'd known each other for years .

" Someone came to see me the other day and said : But you 're so ordinary ! ' " She laughed ; she had evidently taken it as a compliment . So natural and unassuming is her aura that recently a British member of Parliament , who was told he 'd passed continued on page 30 . by her in a restaurant , said " Gad ! I thought it was just some girl trying to look like Jean Shrimpton . " Her startlingly blue eyes halfhidden behind that curtain of honeycolored hair , Jean sipped a giant mug of tea and went on apologizing for herself . " I know I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look ? I ca n't be bothered to make myself look nice . I 'd hate to be thinking about clothes and appearance all the time . Some of this Swinging London set ? they spend half the week buying clothes , and two hours a day getting dolled up . . . and then they think they 've contributed something . " Did she mean girls like Twiggy ? Jean looked at me beseechingly . " No , " she said . " Now please ? do n't go and put in something nasty about Twiggy . I know how it feels to be criticized . And she 's so young ? she 's being used . I have seen her once , and she had the most fantastic , dewy skin . " She seemed serenely untroubled by any thought of rivalry . " After all , we 're such different types . " I asked her whether she enjoyed traveling . " Only if I 've got someone along with me .

" I 'm no good at dancing " I 'm usually disappointed by my pictures . " ... " I have n't any real talent for acting . " I was puzzled at this show of desperate insecurity in one who has been praised to the skies for both her beauty and her professionalsm . Overwhelmed by her early skyrocketing success , she feels , perhaps , that she has had too much , too soon , too easily , and it has left her with a smothering sense of inadequacy , even guilt at her good fortune . Yet it is n't only luck that has made her the most sought-after mocel in the continued ou The two faces of Jean Shrimpton : haughty high-fashion model and friendly farm girl . Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , the real Shrimpton is a rather uncertain , self-belittling combination of both person , , 30 @# 32 world , but hard work , conscientiousness , and a dedicated professional approach . Colleagues testify that Jean is always on time ; never has to be reminded of anything ; never shows temperament or throws tantrums ; seems immune to fatigue . Impulsively generous in her private life , she nevertheless displays an acute business sense when it comes to contracts . And not only about her own work . She told me that her granny , aged 83 , still goes out housecleaning because she enjoys it , and only charges two-and-six ( about forty cents ) an hour . " Oh , Gran , " Jean said to her , " you ought to ask four bob ! " Jean Shrimpton in photographs can look like a Madonna or a milkmaid ? gamine , sexy , sweet , countrified , elegant , imperious or kittenish , at will . She has an extraordinarily expressive face , and an uncanny ability to sense what the photographer wants of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone structure and lithe , long limbs she is one-hundredphotogenic .

" But it has said that if you took a snapshot her with a Brownie camera is pea-soup fog , she 'd still look like Aphrodite . Once a carefree tomboy climbing trees and riding horseback on her father 's farm , now that she 's famous she 's imprisoned by a paralyzing self-consciousness which makes a public appearance , or even a shopping trip , something of an ordeal . She has discovered , as Jacqueline Kennedy once remarked , that it can be frightening to lose your anonymity . " It was all right when I was just starting ; I was n't nearly so shy then . If you are just sort of a pretty girl , you 've got nothing to lose . But now I feel people expect so much of me .

Like the time I went to the Melbourne Races in that cheap mini-shift and no stockings or hat ? if I 'd been unknown , no one would have noticed or cared what I wore . But because I was me , there was an awful fuss and people were shocked . " Jean remembers that 1965 visit to Melbourne , Australia , with embarrassment . But I knew that the outcome had actually been triumphant for her : She went on television and won everybody 's hearts by declaring , " Surely , people are much more important than clothes , and the people here have been wonderful to me.

Her few close friends are terribly important to her ; an ex-roommate describes her as a charming and unselfish companion . " Jean will hate me for saying this , hut she really is just ? sweet . " When she is not working ( and she turns down far more modeling jobs than she accepts ) she browses in bookstores , seeks out furniture for her new house , takes French lessons , and goes often to the cinema ? she has seen Truffaut 's Jules et Jim four times . Frequently at her side is her tiny Yorkshire terrier , Bertie , a trembling waif-like creature with a long Shrimpton fringe . Her love of animals is evident in the decor of her house ? it is full of quaint farmyard pictures , and she has bought three handsome antique rocking horses , leaving herself without a scrap of room for a dining table . She spends many weekends on her parents ' 75-acre Buckinghamshire farm , riding bareback , helping with the animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fondness for horses seems a longstanding thing with the Shrimptons ; her grandfather was a blacksmith .

She chose in the end to appear in a low-budget movie directed by the controversial young British director , Peter Watkins , whose terrifying documentary , The War Game , was banned on British TV , but went on to win an Academy Award . Similarly , his new film Privilege , which has already open in London and is due in New Yo this month , is bound to be controver sial .

But I do want to do better next time .... " Jean Shrimpton today is diffident about her past , bored with her present and uncertain of her future ; no wonder those lovely features look a little sad . As she saw me to the door she murmured , " You see , right now . I 'm just in limbo ? in a nowhere land . "
