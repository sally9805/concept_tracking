txt The House Ways and Means Committee voted today to impose new restrictions on itemized deductions taken by individuals in filing Federal income tax returns . The committee plan would prohibit deductions for some state and local taxes , including those on gas'ohne , cigarettes and liquor . The main purpose is to produce about $500,000,000 in Federal revenue to offset part of the loss in revenue from probable reductions in income-tax rates . A secondary aim is to encourage taxpayers to take the standard deduction ? 10 per cent of their income or $1,000 , whichever is less ? rather than list deductible expenditures for ' state and local taxes , contributions , interest and the like . Decision Is Tentative The committee decision , like others in the voting on President Kennedy 's tax reduction and reform program , was announced as " tentative . " It is subject to reconsideration and possible reversal or modification before a completed bill is reported to the House floor . The committee has not yet acted on the President 's proposals for cuts in individual and corporation income tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New rates for individuals are likely to be set at levels giving everybody some tax relief , although those who itemize deductions may not get so big a a cut as those who take the standard deduction . Under the provision approved today , individuals may continue to take itemized deductions on state or local real estate , income , general personal proparty and general sales and use taxes . Other types of state and local taxes would no longer be de // ductible . These include automobile licenses and drivers ' permits , poll taxes and selective , sales taxes , Levies on hotel and motel bills , admission to race tracks and the transfer of securities are examples , of the selective sales ' taxes that would be affected . Itemization Preferred Taxpayers who choose to itemize their deductions simply list the year 's expenditures for such things as charitable contributions , interest and state and local taxes , add , them and subtract the total from their taxable income , It is usually advantageous for those who are buying homes , and consequently paying interest on mortgages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Most of those in middle and high-income brackets do so . Deductions were . itemized in 24,100,000. of the 61,000,000 individual returns filed in 1961 . Probably less than . one-tenth of most taxpayers ' deductions , consists of state and local taxes that would no longer be allowed under the committee 's Plan . A typical couple with two children and an income of $10 , - 000 itemize about $1,800 in deductions . They may list , for example ; $550 for interest , $200 for contributions , $600 for state and local taxes , $400 for medical expenses and $50 in other deductions . They pay , a tax of $1,196 . If $100 of their expenditures for state and local taxes were of the kind that could not ' be deducted under the committee 's plan , their tax would be $22 higher . Under the new rates proposed by President Kennedy , they would pay a tax of $924 if all deductions presently allowed were take.n . If the restrictions approved by the committee were in effect , they would pay $942 . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the proposed . new. , rates , but still $254 legs than ' they pay Under present The new rOptrictions were proposed by ' Representative Howard H. Baker , Republican of Tennessee , with the Treasury 's backing . The committee approved them by an unannounced vote on a show of hands . It rejected an amendment by Representative John W. Byrnes , Republican of Wisconsin , to continue the deductibility of gasoline taxes . The plan was offered as an alternative to the Administration 's broader proposal , which was designed to yield $2,280 , - 1000,000 in annual Federal revenue . Under the Administration proposal , which apparently . is now dead , itemized deductions would have been allowed only to the ektent that they exceeded 5 per cent , of the taxpayer 's income/ . Today 's action raised to about $600,000,000 the annual revenue yield of tax-reform proposals tentatively approved by the committee so far . This was far short of the $3,300,000,000 sought by Mr. Kennedy as part compensation for the $13,600,000,000 in taxrate cuts he had recommended . Republican Protests I WASHINGTON , June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ways and Means Committee was criticized today by Representative Victor A. Knox of Michigan , a Republican member . He called it " a direct blow to the low and middle-mconie taxpayers of our nation , " " It points out the disregard the Democratic Administration has for the people in our country who are contributing the largest share of Federal income taxes , " he declared .
