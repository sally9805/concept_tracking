During the Johnson Administration , running the crisis-plagued Office of Economic Opportunity was a thankless job and an administrative horror . Sargent Shriver escaped last spring after four high-pressure years , and President Johnson never formally nominated a replacement . The post seemed even less promising under the new Administration . OEO was a favorite target of Candidate Nixon , and one of the new President 's first deeds was to strip the antipoverty agency of its major programs , including Head Start and the Job Corps . It was no wonder that Nixon was unable to find a new director for three months . <P> Last week he finally announced his man : Illinois Congressman Donald Rumsfeld . Presiding over OEO 's burnt-out shell seemed to be an extremely un promising job for an ambitious , attractive young Republican like " Rummy " Rumsfeld . He would be giving up one of the safest seats in Congress : his constituents had sent him to Congress four straight times .

Finally , he will sit on Pat Moynihan 's Urban Affairs Council as chairman of its OEO subcommittee . <P> Cramped Position . Rumsfeld had refused an administration post at first but changed his mind when Nixon sweetened the OEO job with status and responsibility . Also figuring in Rumsfeld 's change of heart was his cramped position in the House . Rumsfeld had made a powerful enemy in Illinois ' Les Arends by joining an unsuccessful attempt to replace Arends as Republican whip . In apparent retribution , the leadership denied Rumsfeld his preference in committee assignments and seemingly cut him off from advancement in the House hierarchy . Apparently , Rumsfeld was blocked . <P> The product of a wealthy , 97% white district of lakeshore suburbs north of Chicago , the Protestant , Princetonian Rumsfeld , 36 , appears at first to be an unlikely choice to lead the nation 's fight on poverty . He opposed much of the Johnson antipoverty legislation , including the measure setting up OEO . He says that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But since he came to Congress in 1963 as a crew-cut conservative , his sympathies for the poor , as well as his hair , have grown .
