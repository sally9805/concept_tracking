Games have contributed richly to our vocabulary . When you use such expressions as " passing the buck , " " calling the turn " or " left in the lurch , " you may not even be aware that you are speaking the language of poker , faro and cribbage . Many sports  --  baseball , horse racing and golf among them  --  have borrowed bridge 's " grand slam " to express the same idea : taking everything in sight . To describe the play involving trumping high in order to set up a trump trick for partner , I did n't hesitate for a moment to steal " uppercut " from boxing . // When the play described here was first observed , Ely Culbertson termed it the Coup Without a Name . Since then , it has come to be called the Scissors Coup for a reason that has nothing to do with the wrestling hold , but is nevertheless entirely apt . Judge for yourself . // With the exception of West 's double of the final contract , the bidding was standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double of one heart ; East had some distributional assets to fortify his raise to two hearts . ( A bid directly over a double denies great strength , for if opener 's partner had a reasonably strong holding , say 10 or more points , he would announce this by redoubling . ) South also had distributional strength to justify his free bid in spades , particularly in view of the fact that he had passed initially . North , of course , had sufficient reserve values to justify a jump to game . // West 's double was another matter . He could hardly hope to gain more than 100 points and , as it turned out , the double made declarer 's danger grimly clear . For West to have any justification for his double , his opening lead of the queen of clubs had to be a singleton ; he must have had three trumps including the two high ones , for he was undoubtedly hoping for a club ruff that would furnish the setting trick . Declarer realized all this but had to figure out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the scissors coup . // Dummy won the club trick and led a trump . West won the trick and shifted to the queen of hearts as expected , won by dummy 's ace , as East dropped the encouraging 8-spot . Now , if declarer led another trump from dummy West would win and put his partner in with a second heart lead . The club return would provide the setting trick . // Declarer could n't get to his hand for the diamond finesse that might let him jettison his losing heart . However , the hope that West held the diamond king inspired South 's solution . He cashed dummy 's ace of diamonds and led the diamond queen . When East played low , South discarded his remaining heart  --  creating a scissors coup , his action having served to cut the line of communication between the defenders ' hands . // Trading a diamond loser for a heart loser was a most profitable exchange . South was able to trump the next heart , keeping East from gaining the lead . Now he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the third trick for his side . But three tricks were all the defenders could take and declarer had scissored his way to success in a doubled contract . // EXTRA TRICK When you have to lose a trick , it can make a great deal of difference which opponent you allow to win it .
