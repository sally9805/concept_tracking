From the Geneva headquarters of the International Commission of Jurists last week came a bitter indictment of justice , Burundi-style . The jurists charge that in the aftermath of last October 's unsuccessful uprising by the underdog Bahutu tribe against the Watutsi monarchy , no less than 86 Bahutus , including all of the elected officers of both houses of Parliament , were executed without even the semblance of a fair trial . <P> The jurists had a special reason for outrage . Alarmed by reports of mass killings , they had received permission last November from the Justice Minister of the King , Mwami Mwambutsa IV , to send their own investigator to the Burundian capital of Bujumbura . Their man showed up in December , but he did not hear until later that 22 executions took place while he was actually in town . <P> The Mwami seemed unmoved by the commission 's report . Unconcernedly , he continued his European holiday with his curvaceous French companion , Josy.                  @ @ @
