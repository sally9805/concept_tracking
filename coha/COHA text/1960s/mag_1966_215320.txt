Prodigious Producer <P> Sir : On the current cover of TIME magazine March 25 my name appears , along with the titles of many of the shows I have produced . There is , however , a very strange drawing of some person or other also on the cover , which is very puzzling to me . Could you possibly have substituted , in error , next week 's cover picture in place of mine ? I consider this figure you have attached to my name monstrous in appearance , bearing no resemblance to my likeness , which appears on the inside in the body of my story-the one in which I am attired in my Ascot suit , the one I wore when I played the lead in My Fair Lady . Therefore , this is to notify you that I am suing you for $1,000,000 for defamation of caricature . <P> DAVID MERRICK New York City <P> Sir : The spontaneous and sensitive painting of David Merrick is a delight .

Could n't you have kindly conceded that this charming champion of the theater has brought delight to thousands of theatergoers , given work to throngs of thespians , and made a place in the sun for worthy playwrights ? JANE RENTON SMITH Plymouth Meeting , Pa . <P> Sir : All that attention to Merrick , entrepreneur , and not a mention of Harvey Sabinson and Lee Solters , his trusty publicists . Eighty percent of what comes out of Merrick 's public mouth began in their heads . Even Merrick has been heard to say , " They are the greatest publicists in New York . " Well he might . Without them he might be just another successful theatrical producer . ( F.Y.I. : I do not work for the gentlemen in question . ) <P> CORINE RIEVES <P> New York City <P> Brutal Tediousness <P> Sir : In your good Essay on American patience March 25 you did not mention one of our ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research . After the discoveries of Uranus and Neptune in 1781 and 1846 it was suspected , because of small irregularities in the motions of these distant wanderers , that there was still another , even fainter , planet . Astronomers calculated a probable orbit , and in March 1929 young Clyde Tombaugh took up the search . He examined scores of telescopic photographs , each showing tens of thousands of star images , in pairs under the blink comparator , or dual microscope . It often took three days to scan a single pair . It was exhausting , eye-cracking work-in his own words , " brutal tediousness . " And it went on for months . Star by star , he examined 20 million images . Then on Feb. 18 , 1930 , as he was blinking a pair of photographs in the constellation Gemini , " I suddenly came upon the image of Pluto ! " It was the most dramatic astronomic discovery in nearly 100 years , and it was made possible by the patience of an American . <P> <P> JOHN WHITE <P> Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I certainly enjoyed your thoughtful and penetrating Essay on the U.S. Senate March 18 , even if my name is only John . <P> JOHN G.
