Britons love to buck the tide . While even Russia and the satellites are marching their economies away from centralization and toward the profit motive , Britain 's new Labor government is charging right ahead to renationalize the steel industry . <P> In the House of Commons last week , the Tories were joined by the small Liberal Party in an attempt to condemn Labor for its announced steel plan . Britain 's steel industry certainly needs some measures to make it more competitive in the world market , where last year it ranked fifth in output ( behind the U.S. , Russia , West Germany and Japan ) . British steel , though technologically advanced , suffers from too many inefficient small firms , and Labor economists argue that if the industry is not nationalized , a massive number of mergers , leading to monopoly situations and price fixing , are bound to occur . The Conservatives admit the problem , but deny that nationalization is the answer . Iain Macleod , lately returned to the Tory front bench after a disgruntled self-exile in journalism , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a 19th century solution to a mid-20th century problem . " <P> With its thin majority , Labor had to haul in M.P.s in wheelchairs and on crutches to save itself , 307 to 301 . Had the motion passed , Prime Minister Harold Wilson 's government could have fallen . <P> <P> Still Compassionate . With the opening steel skirmish won , Wilson turned coolly to the next item on his agenda , an emergency " autumn budget " designed to ease Britain 's painful $2 billion balance-of-payments deficit until the regular budget is drawn up in April . At the same time , Wilson saw a chance to nail down votes for a probable spring election by passing some promised social-welfare measures . <P> It was the first parliamentary test for the new Chancellor of the Exchequer , James Callaghan , 52 , who tried to symbolize new approaches by carrying his speech in a plain manila envelope rather than the traditional battered attache case . Known as " the Mod from the Treasury " because of his sharp wardrobe , Callaghan on this occasion was all business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorted to by Chancellors during their long , dry budgetary speeches . But Callaghan was less of an innovator in the budget itself . Main points : <P> &gt; From cough drops to corn plasters , all prescriptions written under the National Health Service will forthwith be free : a 280 prescription charge on each item was abolished . <P> &gt; Widows ' pensions were tripled ( to $4.20 a week ) , old-age and disability payments increased by 20% , to show that even in times of economic stress , Britain can be " humane and compassionate . " <P> &gt; An already punishing gasoline tax was increased by sixpence ( 70 ) , thus raising the cost of one " Imperial gallon " ( a fifth again as capacious as its U.S. equivalent ) to 750 . <P> &gt; Income tax , which is paid by companies as well as individuals , was raised in the higher brackets by sixpence on the pound , thus bringing the British tax rate back to approximately where it was in 1959 , when the Tories cut it . A previously programmed capital-gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of businessmen .
