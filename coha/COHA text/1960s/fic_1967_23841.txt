A SELFISH STORY A Story by Herbert Gold for M. R. F. Not long ago a girl whom I consider to be as grown-up as myself told me that she remembers my war because she remembers the boots her father wore while washing the car . She was an infant on an Army post . And yet , for those of us who enlisted near our eighteenth birthdays in the early ' forties , the war is still immediate , our youth is not disappeared , and yet time and history have rolled over us , despite our will to give sense to the present and future in the light of the past . Now I must subjugate the past in order to tell about it . In 1942 I embraced New York City . I had spent a year wandering on the read , living out a fantasy of rebellion from Cleveland . part of it in the flophouses of The Bowery and Bleecker Street , but now I had washed and scrubbed myself , turned seventeen and a half , and entered Columbia College . Morningside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any place could be ; Irwin Edman and Mark Van Doren replaced the gamblers and shills on Key Largo , the enraged , oversteamed chefs in restaurant kitchens all up and down the Eastern Seaboard , the hoboes , wild-balls , and predators of the risky America I had pursued . Having so much eccentric fun made me morose and serious . I was an adjusted misfit . The return to college structure was brief . We freshmen , turning eighteen , believed we might finish our first year before going to war . Autumn , black winter , reluctant spring . We read Homer , Thucydides , Herodotus , Humanities and Contemporary Civilization , and felt up the Barnard girlsnear the spiked metal fence on Broadway , and thought about our silver wings , our marksmen 's medals , our future citations and press dispatches . We had no imagination for death , for our own inevitable future deaths , the death of everyone , and for the plain fact that a certain proportion of these readers of bloody Homer would be dead early , very soon now , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits in the process of growing up and imagining one 's own mortality . Living is a flux and flow , but knowledge comes at moments . A serious illness is one start , the death of a parent is another . And sometimes even the incident of education can educate . By pure good fortune , one of these occasions occurred on a lazy late-winter afternoon in Hamilton Hall ; the steam heat was boiling , there was a smell of chalk in the air , a seminar on Lucretius and Time was occupying a group of solemn freshmen and our professor , 0 . J. Campbell , a distinguished scholar of Shakespeare . Up till this afternoon , I must note , I had not formed any real friendships at school , although I admired the mad Cuban of Hartley Hall , who ran naked up and down the corridors , working out , and a boy with a Maine accent who wanted to he either a missionary or a dean , and an irritable young man from White Plains who felt misused because he was adopted into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the football team , a popular kid ; I had spent a year on the road and felt cut off from him and the other middle-class youngsters making their way on squads and in clubs . T did n't even write for The Jester , the college review , or The Spectator , though I was a secret poet and journal keeper . On that sleepy , still afternoon in Hamilton Hall , a crucial discovery was opened to me , and with it I also made my first close college friend . Professor Campbell , looking out over the dozen of us slouched around a table , talking about time and time 's end , suddenly remarked to this serious crew of freshmen , " I was dead once , and I came back . I was dead and I remember it . " He had had a heart attack ; he had gone under ; then he had returned . " I was dead . I still remember it . " The words were ordinary , but in the act of uttering them , he suddenly forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thick gray eyebrows , a heavy , handsome old head . A look of withdrawal , a look of the deepest seriousness possessed him . There was an uneasy silence in the room . Ahead of my first risk in the war , ahead of my first dangerous illness , ahead of the first death of someone close to me , I suddenly had a premonition of what death might mean , beyond the drama of grief and mourning . My own heart stopped . There was the excitement of discovery and a terrible loneliness . At that moment , and perhaps just as Professor Campbell began to speak once more of Lucretius , I noticed a fellow student , whom I shall now call Marvin Shapiro . Purplish hickies stood out in the pallor of his face . He was stunned by this reminiscence of death , as I had been , and he too felt that premonitory grief and loneliness . And then he flushed as the blood returned . . After class I approached Shapiro and we talked . We cut the rest of our classes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circled the track , told our stories , listened to our stories , and finally got around to the subject of girls . This led naturally to a number of pitchers of beer at the West End Tavern on Broadway . By closing time we decided we were lifelong friends , and so we were . Marvin was a skinny boy with a deep voice , a surcharged Adam 's apple , and a family in Brooklyn . He wanted to be a radio announcer , a physicist , and a lover of beautiful women . I shared the latter ambition , but aimed at poetry and philosophy as the means to this dreamed-of end . I also told him ( me from Lakewood , Ohio ) that he was my first Jewish friend . Marvin looked at me as if I must be crazy . He knew nothing about Lakewood , Ohio . Expanding our horizons , we organized expeditions to eat eggplant parmigiana on First Avenue and fish at Louie 's on South Street near the market . We were voyeurs who stopped at every doorway . And after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sting of prying was a philosophical lust , we thought , but also we were perpetually horny . Strolling through the fish market , we saw a child idly piddling his hands in a barrel of shrimp . It was a boy of eight or nine in a corduroy jumper jacket ; he had a bored , sallow , pretty , Italian face , and he was dipping his hands into the crisp pinkshells and letting them spill through his fingers like doubloons in a pirate movie ; he was watching the stand for his father . One withered leg encased in a shiny paraphernalia of metal braces . Marvin 's eyes filled with tears . Disasters and horrors are familiar in the city . Only a few days ago we had seen a dead man propped against a wall near St. Mark 's in the Bouwerie . Marvin was shaking his head and tears were rolling down his cheeks . " What 's the matter ? " I asked him . " That kid 'll never get laid , " he said . Like most young men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solve all our problems with college , girls , boredom , and anxiety . We could be heroes in the war . When Marvin and I began to talk about it , however , it seemed different to us . Professor Campbell 's eyes looking downward , looking inward , had changed our feeling about the days to come . We were infected by the beginning of the imagination of death , and it lay beneath our friendship as a shared battle . We too had been born twice . In all friendships between adolescent boys there are curious contradictions , rivalries , family difficulties . I was surely jealous of Marvin 's great fortune with girls , whom he met and conquered in subway crowds , on campus walks , wherever he deigned to point his ardent , demanding eyes , his shiny beak , and his disturbed face . He would take a girl for a walk and an ice cream , and not get back to Hartley Hall till his first morning class . Unless he lurked outside , imagining my envy all through the grimy New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out someplace to go with the lady after the walk , the hamburgers , and the balcony of the 42nd Street movie . On the other hand , he envied me too  --  my lack of " nervousness . " In those days I seemed calm . To Marvin I was a rock , though I knew myself to be volcanic lava , in inexorable motion . Also he envied me my year underground , hitchhiking , working at odd jobs on the Florida Keys , escaping the Ivy League , as he called it , somehow including Brooklyn . No wonder I was calm , he told me : life had not passed me by . All he had to his credit was satisfied lust . Poor Marvin . I would have given up the life that had not passed me by for one , two , or three  --  as many as the genie might allow me  --  of the girls Herbert Gold 's new novel ( he has written seven ) is " Fathers , " published by Random House . He grew up in Cleveland , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities . He now lives in San Francisco . with whom Marvin strolled . Satisfied lust ! But I would offer them deep feeling , each and every one . He shrugged . They could n't resist him , he said , but that was not life . Every time he traveled in a crowded subway , he made a new conquest , and that was not life either . That was just rubbing . Each and every one would have been appalled by my morose deep feeling . They liked Marvin  --  cheerful rubbing . I discovered . I think , why Marvin charmed women . It only seemed to be mere cheerful rubbing . He needed them , he really needed and wanted girls , this one and that one , each one in particular . He was born for women . We walked around Van Am Quad , a little space of brick and grass , endlessly turning in the damp midnight , while he explained , " Some people are ambitious . You wake up and write poems at dawn ? " " I kill myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cold and gray and I know I 'll die if I ca n't curve into her body ? ' " Whose , Marvin ? " " So the next day I take a subway ride at rush hour . I find someone . I sniff it out and wiggle in , sometimes we never even look at each other 's face ? sometimes we walk out together and go to her place ? " " What do you talk about ? " He grinned in the darkness . " I tell her how much I need her . I love her . I desire her . I treasure her . I adore her . I 'll do anything for her , and more to her . flitch-bert , when I talk like that , I 'll tell you , they always listen closely . " The bust of Van Am glistened in the diffuse gray of a globe lamp . There were blackout curtains on the dormitory windows nearby , and lights where the V-12 program Navy boys were doing calculus and navigation problems . We walked round and round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribute to womankind . He did not hide his need . He surrounded them with joyous hunger . He gave it freely , and thus they could forgive everything . He may not have been sincere , but he was desperate . Girls had the key ; friends had the key ; excitement and variety and new adventures had the key . Everyone was grateful to be able to do so much for Marvin . He responded with the tenderness of a gratified child . He could barely remember their names . He also met a Barnard girl named Ellen who wore black woolen dresses , had long black hair , a long maternal figure ; she wept when he took her into the cold bushes , wept when he brought her out , and wept all the way to her parents ' apartment when they had left it empty for the weekend . Marvin reported , somewhat worried , that she wasstill weeping when they emerged on a fine sunny winter afternoon . He had enjoyed the love of a good woman , and he found it wet . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly with the sag of midyear at college , partly with my lack of the love of a good or a bad woman , I began to figure on not waiting till the end of the school year to go into the Army . Casually one day I mentioned this to Marvin . He must have spent an unusually damp evening with Ellen , because his answer was short and to the point : " Yeah ! " The jukebox at the West End was playing , I recall , a song with this line , " Get outta here and get me some money , too .... " It solved the problem of cuts in classes , the itch for adventure , the discomfort of school , the failures of successes with girls . We would go in together , and be heroes together . We enlisted together . Before telling his parents that he was to go into the Air Corps , he asked me to spend a night with him in Brooklyn . I expected to be bored  --  parentsbut instead I was amazed . No plump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wore a yachting cap indoors and liked drink , exotic foods , and fishing . He had his own boat . He talked about mizzens and fore and aft ; I was learning Latin and French , but had no grasp of yachting . His face was weathered by Long Island Sound . I had never met a sailing Jew before . Mrs. Shapiro was a soft sweet woman with a small , pretty , girlish face ; she read good books and listened to Beethoven and smiled at her husband 's jokes . He did calisthenics on a bar above the bed in their room . It was a jazzy household , unlike anything 1 had expected in that large , old-fashioned , furniture-filled house on a leafy Brooklyn street . There was also another son , younger than Marvin , to whom little attention was paid . Marvin was clearly the hope of the family , and Mr. Shapiro was delighted by his son 's wildness . He twisted and dodged through life in a way which would have hurt him at thirty , but at eighteen he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meaning . He had style . From afar I admired a sense of luxuriousness . Even now , when rubbing up against strange girls in the subway does not seem very stylish , I carry the memory of a lively boy , with a swollen Adam 's apple , a deep laugh in a skinny body , doted on by his parents and allowing himself all pleasures . Marvin told them we were both going to war soon . This followed a discussion about Orientals in which we all agreed that there was something puzzling about the newspapers ' descriptions of how to tell the face of a Japanese  --  sneaky , yellow , totalitarian  --  from that of a Chinese . The Chinese face in those days was open , smiling , friendly , and democratic . Marvin 's father had a wild , high , energetic laugh at this . He said that the objective testimony of witnesses was sometimes inaccurate . He liked the way his son thought ahead . " Aitch-bert and I are going to enlist , " Marvin said suddenly . " It 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His mother dropped a spoon ; it made a little chime against her foot . Silent tears . His father clapped him on the back and said , " I knew it , why not ? You 'll tear ' em apart . They 'll give up as soon as they get the news . " His eyes glittered with envy . Marvin 's kid brother looked adoring and pleased . No one fretted about his mother 's tears until Marvin kissed her on the neck and she sobbed wildly . The night before Marvin and I went to Camp Upton , we bought tickets for The Skin of Our Teeth , with Tallulah Bankhead . She wiggled and chanted the Joycean lines . If only she had known we were about to go off to die for our country , we both thought , she would have been absolutely indifferent to us anyway . The next day we shipped out , were stripped naked , and began to put on our new lives . As with girls , so with the war . Marvin seemed to have all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He became what both of us had wanted to be , a fighter pilot . I went to the infantry , and then to a school to learn Russian , toward a vague Army hope that I might help to provide liaison with our gallant Soviet allies . In the periods between drill , study , and fret , we deep Russian scholars continued real life by drinking , writing letters , and chasing girls at the USO . Most of us were successful at the first two projects , less at the third . I corresponded with Marvin , with Ellen , and with Marvin 's mother . He was in England , flying missions over the Continent . I was in wet white Maryland that next winter , doing maneuvers through an American landscape  --  barns , churches , apple orchards  --  all traced and spelled in Russian on our maps . O'er the steppes of Maryland I wandered , dressed like a wolf , carrying a compass , a full pack , and a new vocabulary . Marvin 's mother wrote that she missed our coming out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his weekends in his small sailboat , digging salt fish out of the salt sea . He was also doing civilian-patrol work . She was worried about her son and wanted me to reassure her . A Story by Herbert Gold 91 Ellen wrote that she was crazy in love with Marvin and he did n't write often enough . So she wanted to receive letters from me , since I was his best friend . Marvin wrote that the English girls were peculiar but cooperative . He was now a first lieutenant , and what with his silver bars and all , he did n't like to do it standing up in the alleys of Piccadilly . So he had found girls who were willing to take him home . They liked chocolate and they liked to rock with him as the bombs fell and the sirens shrieked . I remember this particularly now because it takes me back to the time when prowess , position , and opportunity were the great issues in love . It was technical and it was to be shared among men . Marvin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He could dream of a girl in a flowing skirt , flowers and sunlight in a field , and also admire the technique of the wife of a Pakistani colonel ( or perhaps he was an English colonel stationed in India ) . Poor Marvin 's mother , whose innocent boy was practicing the rites of killing and lust . Poor Ellen , who imagined him pining for her , needing her . Poor me , crawling around in Russian in the snowbanks and slushy mud of Maryland in winter . Our officers were combat dropouts  --  men so ineffective at war that they were sent back to train future intelligence officers . The only one not to be pitied seemed to be Marvin himself , handsome , his acne drying under doses of adrenalin , collecting missions and medals and the wives of our allies . He made captain . The boy quick into the bushes of Riverside Drive was also quick in the sky against the stubby German fighters . Ellen , his mother , and I all formed his audience against the backdrop of horror and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seen from our distance , the garish light lit his face and made it angelic . One winter night my group returned to Camp Ritchie , the intelligence training post in Maryland , after nearly a week of simulated war in marshes and orchards . We had been frozen and misled ; we had been fired upon and tested ; we had conducted a strange war among Maryland mountain people to whom we were not allowed to speak English . We needed shaves ; we were jittery with stimulants ; we smelled bad . Our mission had been a failure because our officer , who had been responsible for a minor disaster at Anzio , still believed that his own sense of direction was superior to that of a compass . He knew the way ; could a compass think ? Consequently we had been lost for three days in a prickly , cutover pine des-ert . I felt as if ice had been packed into my ears . We had the usual gripes against officers . They became the real enemy . We stood in our long khaki overcoats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we tried to get warm , slurping coffee from our mess kits , and reading the accumulated mail . Our officer went to sulk because north was not where north used to be in the Alabama National Guard . 1 tore open my little stack of mail . A letter from Marvin described a weekend in London . What fun , what sparkle amid the blackout . A duke 's daughter , he claimed ; mentally I made him out a liar but read on . She loved him , she really did . He cared for her a lot , of course , but not that much . Ellen was writing him weepy letters and he supposed he would have to close now in order to drop her a line . Ellen wrote to ask if I had heard from Marvin . She was worried . He must be ill or something . The last letter was from his mother . It was the most recent . Marvin had been shot down over Germany ; others in the squadron had seen his parachute open , but it was being fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . He was presumed dead . I crawled outside into the snow . I heaved and gagged and groaned because I had forgotten how to weep . I was too old to cry , and not yet old enough ; later I would learn again . But now there was only this churning physical turmoil like seasickness , like jealousy , like lust and dread . The desire to run away or to deny was changed into an eating of the lining of my belly . I was simply sick , a trivial response to death , I then thought and still believe . I remembered Professor Campbell , his head down , contemplating the Fact . I remembered the awe Marvin and I had shared , which had been the foundation of our friendship before the matter of girls and career and the war came to give us the details of intimacy . I was appalled that I dared to feel my own body , even in sickness , when Marvin was simply without feeling , without soul , dead . I recalled with disgust Dostoevski 's denunciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowning , he feels only the tears running down his own face . And yet I now had only myself . In the midst of this unreal war for which I was merely preparing , I had lost my emblem of vitality and true life , my friend . I was bereft . I was gagging in the deep , silent Maryland winter , with nearby slush piles and garbage cans and the debris of soldiering and , just beyond , a horizon of scrub and poor soil itching through the snow and a whiteness of hills and winter sky . The earth was an ache . This was the third death I had known in my life , and perhaps the beginning of the sense of my own death . I saw Marvin 's face  --  grinning , delighted by life  --  under his parachute swinging down and then exploding in midair as he hung between heaven and hell . I have seen him there for twenty years , and so he will be always . Like Dostoevski 's Turgenev , I am telling a selfish story . After grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes a vain young poem , of course . It was a long elegy to the memory of Captain Marvin Shapiro ( 1924-1945 ) and I typed it in the company orderly room at Camp Ritchie , Maryland , and sent it to the Atlantic Monthly , 8 Arlington Street , Boston , Massachusetts . Presently it was returned with a long letter signed by a lady who had apparently been moved by this death in my life . I have n't seen the poem since the end of the war , I have lost track of it , but I am reasonably certain it was not a good one . I remember little about it other than its shape on the page and the rhyme scheme . I believe the editor wrote to me because I was a soldier mourning a dead friend and there was a war on . Shortly afterward I was shipped out . I carried the letter from Marvin 's mother with me . His body was never found . He had written to me that it was odd to have the initial on the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to parachute into Germany ; but he kept the initial . Anyway , he was destroyed in the sky . The class of ' 46 , my class , mostly returned to begin college again as twenty-one-year-old sophomores . We counted our losses and secretly watched out of the corners of our eyes those with missing limbs or raw , still-healing scars . Some of us were still in line for plastic surgery , some were outpatients , many were on partial-disability pensions . Our hairlines had changed . Moony faces were lean and loony . There was confusion , the GI Bill , and a host of babies who claimed to be college students , too . I could not take up school as I had before , in a dormitory , with a roommate . I rented a room off Broadway and thought to enter adult life after the three years of murderous limbo . Our bodies twitched with unfulfilled destruction . How dare we live , how dare we not live ? A friend and I jumped a thuggish heckler at a street-corner Henry Wallace rally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , food , anything small and large . We called it the Book Find Club . Our motto was : Steal four books and get a fruitcake free from the A &; P. We initiated girls into the sport . In their confusion they thought the war heroes must know what they were doing . They thought we were heroes and nervous . We were , in fact , nervous . Around my thoughts of Marvin , on whose behalf I was taking certain revenges against the world , whom I was sometimes imitating in the subway , I came gradually to think of his mother , his father , and Ellen . Probably I did not know how to meet the grief of others ; I was busy installing myself in the Bohemian student life of those days , all of us in khaki , sullen , arrogant . But gradually , as the months went by , I decided to visit Marvin 's survivors ; at last I telephoned Mrs. Shapiro in Brooklyn , she reminded me of how to get to Avenue K by subway . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the roar of the tunnel . At the subway entrance I began to think of the smoked eel I had eaten for the first time at their house . Marvin had said , bragging , " We have eels all the time  --  crabs , lobsters , oysters , shrimp . Snails . Clams . " " Do you eat pork ? " I asked . " Feb , unclean , " he had said . You know that joke ? " I remembered pausing at the newsstand to pick up a copy of PM . They were selling the New York Post with the same old headlines , and I thought it was the same man with the papers , fret on his face , hair in his ears , waiting out his time . Still alive . I expected the house to be shaded , dark with mourning . Instead , it was light and sunny , with the curtains pulled hack and the surprising winter sunlight filling the rooms . But it seemed empty . Even some of the furniture was gone . It was emptied of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enlisted , not as a lawyer but as an expert sailor , and had commanded a landing craft , and had fought as an overage captain through southern France . After the end of the war he had simply not returned . Mrs. Shapiro , smiling , told me that he had found a girl in Marseilles . I could n't imagine what a Brooklyn lawyer would do in Marseilles ? Jean Gabin yes , Mr. Shapiro no  --  and I saw him in a corduroy cap , on the waterfront , a handsome , stocky , make-out , middle-aged settler in France , with a young high-breasted chick with wooden soles on her shoes . Mrs. Shapiro said simply , " It broke up our family . We were a good family , I think , but we needed Marvin . " Her other son was now at Yale , going very white-shoe . She made tea . We talked about Marvin . Tea , raisin toast , orange marmalade , chocolate cookies . I thought of Marvin 's hickies ? " zits , " the freshmen now called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , I knew , would later want to tell me more . My need for a community of mourning gave way to embarrassment . I could not be husband andson to her , and when I slipped out into the deep early night , I felt relief to escape . Marvin was my friend in the past . What community I sought could not be built of nostalgia . Still , I wanted to find Ellen . When I finally met her again , she was also in mourning , wearing an ugly , shapeless woolen dress , flat shoes , her hair untended , smelling of anxiety and poor caring . She was a graduate student and had a reputation for persistent moping . Never a very pretty girl , she had been a sweetly attractive one . Now at age twenty-three , she looked ravaged , as if she had been left out in funky weather . I had a bit more patience with her than with Marvin 's mother . We took coffee and meals together near campus . She wanted to drink at the West End @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often . Three times , I think . She imagined for herself a deep love affair ; she imported it backwards into history ; she imagined widowhood . At first I shared the play , stunned by her conception of him , which seemed so much deeper than my own . They had been truly in love , they had been deep true lovers ; it was not wrestling in the grass , it was not couch work in her parents ' apartment on Central Park West , it was an immortal passion ; her hero had been blasted out of the skies by fate and she would treasure his memory forever . Marvin and Ellen stood in the great tradition of doomed lovers . She was a graduate student in literature . After a few immersions in her fantasy of the past , I began to feel discomfort and then resentment . Marvin had been my best friend . But he slipped away in the tumult of Ellen 's ardent dream . I found new resources of coldness in myself . I would watch impatiently for her to finish her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 113th Street . Once , when she managed to order another beer , I felt myself ready to groan with boredom . And when she wanted me to come to her room , tiptoeing past the other rooms , past the common kitchen , I felt as if I were being led into a trap . Her wet beery kisses were not for me . I twisted away and cried out , " You 're lying to yourself I Never cared about you ! He had girls everywhere , in England , Brooklyn , everywhere ! " She started to run down the darkened hall . I caught her at the door , held her in my arms as she struggled , and pointed out that it was not my room from which she was running , but her own . She should stay and I should go . Be rational . Be logical . Make sense . I 'm sorry , but it 's the truth . I believed myself to be proudly surgical , but also 1 was smelling the stench of a woman 's hysteria for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hatred were going off in my arms . " You think you can play God ! You think you 're God and my judge ! " she shrieked at me . The practice of playing God and judge sometimes exhausts itself with time . I have the disease worse than most ( Ellen , wherever you are ) . I dragged her back to her room . Invisible ears were pressed to the shut bedroom doors . Community kitchen , community crises . Shush , shush , I said . The stringent leaping sobs subsided ; she was simply weeping ; I put her in bed with her clothes on , covered her , and sat stroking her hand . Toward dawn she fell asleep . Cold-eyed I felt . I tiptoed out . Back on the street , 1 saw a metal case of milk at the door of a short-order restaurant . For the first time in my life  --  not the last  --  I had spent a night trying to calm a woman made mad by something I had said . And for the last time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really my fault at all , I was right , I had done the right thing , I was right . So I told myself . So I told myself again .

They were turning a veteran from their door . The metal case of milk glittered in the early light . I looked at the bottles . My hand felt a premonitory sensual coolness , like touching a loved woman . It would be sweet to drink long , cool swallows from the bottle and then heave it into the street . I was thirsty and hungry and cold and feverish and I decided not to steal a bottle of milk . I stood there , squinting at the metal case . I would leave it in a moment . I would leave without a bottle for myself . This was a new reaction for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new . IV When next I saw Ellen , she had changed her hair , cut it stylishly , and her clothes looked recently dry-cleaned . Now she was a handsome , perhaps too mature twenty-three-year-old woman . She was going with someone . She had a friend ( stare , blush , angry stare ) . We met as acquaintances , not as friends , She made it clear that I had sacrificed our past friendship . But she bore me no ill will ; she smiled and inquired about my doings . I had little to say to her . Our life together was all in the past . I had projects for the future . She was married within the year , gave up graduate work , got pregnant , left New York . Though I insisted to myself that I had done the right thing , she made COCK OF THE WALK TALK by Felicia Lamport Every rooster in his patch Keeps his hen-folk up to scratch Urging them to quicken speed Though they work for chicken feed .

Now the years have passed and I think of my friend who died when he and I were mere children . The event still seems real when I remember it , but like a reality glimpsed through thick glass , without the physical heft of life . Recently , however , an immediate grief seemed to break the glass of memory and Marvin came tumbling free and alive again . The distancing of history is fatal , and yet it can be reversed . I am accustomed to his death . And yet , when I needed an occasion to express my grief at something else , at something happening to me , in my own life , I found Marvin waiting like a boy , ready to play . I told the story about him to a friend who was a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he had time to lose his adolescent acne .

Do you think he 's still in Marseilles ? His mother is an old woman . His kid brother is a middle-aged professor . " " At Williams College , I heard . " " So , " she said . " So it was a long time ago . " Yes , child , that was mere history . Yet there are new wars for which we must prepare ourselves , and I am still ready . I am also ready to join the company of 0 . J.
