The Western Pacific is a short ( 1,188 miles ) railroad whose main line runs from Salt Lake City to the Coast , but its tracks cover some coveted ground . Last week , in a conference before the Interstate Commerce Commission in Washington , two of the nation 's biggest and richest railroads staked out their claims to take over the Western . The Southern Pacific started to do so four months ago , after acquiring 10% of Western 's stock ; it wants to merge the Western system into its own to get the benefit of new business while eliminating duplicating facilities . <P> The Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe , which countered Southern Pacific 's challenge by quickly picking up a 20% holding in Western , wants to run Western as a separate , semi-autonomous railroad , continue to use it to compete with the Southern Pacific . Other railroads joined the fight . The Santa Fe 's transcontinental archrival , the Union Pacific , whose lines tie in with the Southern Pacific 's , said that it had bought up 10% of Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rock Island &; Pacific , which competes with the Santa Fe in the Midwest , also came out in favor of Southern Pacific 's proposal . The Rock Island , which is linked to the Western system at Salt Lake by the Denver , Rio Grande &; Western , fears that a Santa Fe-controlled Western would route traffic over the Santa Fe rather than the Rock Island . <P> But the Santa Fe also had friends . Western Pacific directors endorsed the Santa Fe plan , and the Great Northern Railway , which has a line that ties in with the Western system at Bieber , Calif. , backed the Santa Fe and bought 8% of Western 's stock to give its support more weight . <P> After the conference , the case was recessed until the formal hearings begin in San Francisco , possibly this summer . On grounds of preserving competition , it looked as if the Santa Fe had the better chance of winning ICC 's O.K. , since it would cooperate with the Western to compete against the Southern Pacific . If ICC allowed the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area would be left with a one-company rail system-just as it was 52 years ago , before the Western Pacific was built to break the Southern Pacific 's monopoly .
