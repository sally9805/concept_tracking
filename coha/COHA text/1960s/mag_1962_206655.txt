The dusty parking lot in San Angelo , Texas , was jammed with out-of-state cars from as far away as Pennsylvania , and the stands that were built to handle 1,400 spectators had to make do for 3,500 . Unshaven cowboys in faded Levi 's waved fistfuls of greenbacks and haggled over the odds with Houston oilmen in embroidered shirts . A volunteer comedian told ancient jokes to try to keep tension down as the crowd awaited the biggest rodeo event in years : a matched roping contest between two champion lariat handlers . The stakes were $3,700 in cash , a share of the bets , and undisputed claim to being the best calf roper in the world . <P> No Steers . The sport that made Will Rogers a rodeo star originated with the vaqueros of Spanish Mexico , spread across the West in the mid-1800s . At first , trail-driving cowboys practiced the art on range steers , but so many good beef cattle were crippled that steer roping was outlawed in Texas 60 years ago . Today 's rodeo cowboys rope calves-mean Brahman calves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roper 's ribs with one kick . The roper races against time : on horseback , he must run down and lasso a charging calf , jump off his horse , wrestle the calf on its side , loop three of its legs with a " pigging string , " and finish off his handiwork with a nonslip " hooey " hitch . Expert ropers can do it all in ten seconds or less . <P> The two cowpokes who dueled fortnight ago in San Angelo are old and bitter rivals . The Texas favorite , Jim Bob Altizer , 30 , was the Rodeo Cowboys Association champion in 1959 , began roping chickens and dogs when he was still a toddler , graduated to goats at seven . " I 've had a rope in my hands ever since I can remember , " says Altizer , and his rope has won him a 38,000-acre ranch stocked with 600 Hereford cows , 6,000 sheep , 4,500 angora goats . <P> Against him stood the champion from Idaho , Dean Oliver , 33 , who grew up as a field hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sleeping on the ground and skipping meals to save money , Oliver taught himself how to handle a rope , won the first of his five Rodeo Cowboys Association championships in 1955 . With $26,656 of prize money won on the rodeo circuit so far this year , Oliver was recognized as king of the ropers everywhere but in Texas . Said one show-me Texan : " We been followin ' Jim Bob 's tracks through the brush for years . Do n't try to sell us on no Idaho dirt farmer . " <P> <P> Not Much . In a regular rodeo , the ropers get two calves apiece . This time it was twelve calves per man . and , by starting time , upwards of $100,000 had been bet on the match . " I 'm not nervous , " Oliver insisted . " Not much , anyway . But when you get a thing going like this , with money ridin ' , you try so much harder . It 's the pressure that gets you-not the calves . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
