's wife . " Got a pretty good notion too who you might be , " he added , a remark that made Carla 's face relax for the first time . After she had gone , Rat scolded Ace , " So this is your woman come back . You backsliding pathic , so you went and sent an S.O.S. for her . " " That 's what old Clay charged me with last night , " Ace yawned . Rat came over to within a few inches of Ace 's jaw and watched him . " My God , Rat is lovely ! " It was Carla Chisholm 's voice again . She reappeared for a moment , ignored by the two men in the room , and was dreamily surveying the scene . " Get , Carla . I said shoo , " Ace mumbled between his teeth . Rat sat down in the big leather chair with a crash , opened his Greek primer , gave a last blink at Carla retreating to the kitchen , and asked Ace to open his primer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that ? " Rat suddenly jerked his head in the direction of Clayton Harms , who had begun sweepingthe floor with an oversize broom . " Clay , knock that off and go to the pool parlor if you got to use your elbow grease . " " Awful dirty in here , " Clayton pleaded hopelessly . " You heard Rat . " Banging the broom into its place in a far corner , grumbling , Clayton Harms trudged on out into the dining nook to sit down facing Carla . " I have to say it all over again , " Carla said to Clayton , but her voice easily carried to the front room . " Never saw such a beautiful boy outside of pictures . "  | " It wo n't last , " Clayton said in a whisper that did not carry . " Why not ? " Carla wondered . " Why , he 'll die , " Clayton replied sleepily in the manner of Ace . " And where do you get your information ? " Carla spoke with some of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said condescendingly . " Broken fate line . " " Well , I do n't need to ask you who 's been giving you palmistry lessons , " Carla said and sighed , for everybody knew that Eustace could read palms extremely well . After his father failed in business in Grand Rapids , Michigan , and shot himself through the roof of his mouth in the canning-factory office from which he had conducted his affairs for over thirty years , Eustace Chisholm , two days after the funeral , left for Chicago . The next fall he began attending the university for a while , and actually came close to being graduated . Coming out into the world at the end of the Hoover and beginning of the Roosevelt period , he could find no work except a few parttime jobs that did not last : he worked as a short-order cook in a pullman-car eatery , as a receptionist-file clerk in a home for feeble-minded boys , as a reader to a blind millionaire , and whatever else he could get . All his jobs terminated , his employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup , " and he soon became acquainted with the bite and pinch of full unemployment . Camping on the doorstep of the university vocationalguidance bureau , he soon learned the order of preference given to undergraduates and alumni  --  the bu/reau was interested first in athletes and lettermen , next in youths with religious training , and third in those with **25;8195;TOOLONG . Ace 's application was always " reactivated " only to be marked after two or three weeks ' trial , " not active . " He now began the easy descent from intermittentlygoing without to actual deprivation and hunger . He had sunk so low when Miss Carla Hartshorn met him that , when she proposed , he said he had just enough strength left to say yes . Carla made much of her credentials , if nothing of her character as a woman . For that era , she had a " grand " job in the auditing department of the City of Chicago  --  and she would be able to keep a roof over their heads . Up to the time he was " saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . He had ended up living with Negroes on 33rd and South Parkway in a " tin house . " Along with pennies and cigarette butts in the streets , he had picked up a dose of syphilis , though this badge of Venus surprised him more than it frightened him because of the infrequency with which love had been bestowed on him . The only thing that never failed him in his period of dry rot was the visit of his Muse , for his mania of being a poet seldom left him . During this pre-Carla period , Eustace Chisholm 's fingers trembled so when he lit a cigarette that his colored friends used to inquire if he was sure he was cured , or if he had gone on to locomotor ataxia . Ace would look at his hands thoughtfully in the tin room and say , " Oh , I 'm cured of syph but I 'm not cured of me . Look at that classic Americanhand "  --  holding out his palm  --  " pure stock from back to the Indians , shaking now like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his listeners , " I got another bacillus in me sciencewo n't find a name for . " Friends of both bride and groom agreed that by the morning of their wedding , Ace Chisholm had certainlyp23crossed the borderline of sanity . In that epoch it scarcely seemed to matter , and Carla had the American woman 's fixed idea that love can cure , love can heal , love can bind a flowing wound , and their friends all hoped for the best . As Carla sat in the dining-nook , three years after their wedding , opposite her husband 's lover , the sign-salesman , her thoughts floated round and about the shipwreck of her two marriages , the legal one , and the make-believe one , and she welcomed the presence of Clayton and the progress of the Greek lesson in the front room to keep her from breakingdown again with hysteria in front of Amos . Under the encouragement of Clayton 's eyes , with the words of Attic Greek sounding like barks from angry whelps , she heard herself talking at length of her hegira , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears of a stranger . She made no point of concealing the truth , for the truth was all she could bear now . Her time away had been spent with someone even more impractical than her husband  --  Baxter Evans  --  a young man just out of the university , who had found even less of a reception awaiting him in the world than had Ace . He was no more equipped for the one job he had stumbled on , in a big bakery , than he had been for his role as eloper and adulterer . He barely fulfilled his sexual task , and then only because he felt it was part of running away with someone ; Ace , of coarser stuff , had at least gone through with the connubial duties , faithfully , regularly , and thoroughly , if without feeling or tenderness . After a few months ' freedom , Carla found herself nursing Baxter in cheap lodging rooms , from a sudden onslaught of illnesses which increased in number and symptoms alarmingly : lame back , fever , catarrh , excessive sweating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ailed him , and the medicinep24they prescribed only made him worse . Drinking bootleg whiskey seemed the only palliative , and Carla found herself in strange places and situations trying to secure it . One cold October evening , coming home with his " medicine , " she found Baxter gone . After a few days , she was about to go to the police when she became unaccountably ill herself . When she recovered , there was a letter waiting for her postmarkedPiqua , Ohio . It was from Baxter 's mother , who thanked Carla for having bestowed the most loathsome of all diseases on her son : he was now under the care of their old family physician , but of course he would never have the untainted health he had had before meeting her . She ended her letter with the hope that in the future Carla would insinuateher poison into the bloodstream only of men of her own age and social class and leave promising young men of good family connections like Baxter alone . Thinking cautiously as she concluded her recital , Clayton Harms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his nose , in way of salute , and said , " Well , welcome back anyway , old girl ! " and winked ferociously at her . " Just to think , " Ace was saying meanwhile in the front room to Amos , " here I am old enough to be your Grandpa , sitting at your feet to get my Greek . " He grunted . " I wonder if I 'll live long enough to read Pindar . " " You should get as far as The Greek Anthology , " Amos Ratcliffe ventured , encouraging his pupil with a nice show of teeth . " Fact is , " Ace confided , " I 'm not nearly so bright as I was . Do n't think I can lay it all at the door of the dose , but you never know . At the time I could only afford the services of a horse doctor , and I 'm probably spotty with brain damage , different cirrhoses , kidney attrition , and it would bep25unsurprising if I now have two or three kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot through me in charity clinics . . . Only time my mind comes all the way clear is when I 'm letting the words run and flow over the Chicago Tribune . " " Look over here , Ace , " Amos 's voice took on an edge . " Do you want your lesson , or do n't you ? ' , ' Standing up , arching his back , Ace went up to within a few inches of his teacher and inquired , haphazardly , pulling on the lobe of his ear : " What do you do for money these days , Rat ? " Amos Ratcliffe put down his Introduction to Attic Greek and now acted like the pupil pausing to answer the professor'sweighty question . Still standing over him , Ace roughed up the boy 's shock of tight curls , then touched the piece of court-plaster on his brow , and said : " Who 'd you say has been cleaning up on you this time , outside of that landlord of yours ? " The tone of near-concern , touched almost with tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doing anything about money , " Rat replied to the earlier question of Ace 's . " I could go on relief if I was of age , and it so happens I did go over to the welfare office a while back and the minute those relief blacks in the waitingroomcaught sight of me , Shoo , fly , shoo , ' they said and damned if I did n't take their advice and lit out . " Still thinking of money , Ace said : " Do n't I remember you once mentioning you had a mother somewhere , an aunt or cousin or somebody . " Amos looked hollow-eyed . " You 're thinking of Cousin Ida . That 's the name my Mother always goes under , I told you . " Ace sat down and inflated his cheeks like the wind godsp26in Italian paintings . " Cousin Ida , " he repeated , as Carla made another of her stealthy reappearances at the door . " Rat 's parents were never married . " Ace stared at Carla . " Yes , " Amos said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucking wedlock . " " So let 's cross Cousin Ida off the list of those who can donate funds . " Ace wrote something on the fly-leaf of his Greek grammar . Carla now walked rather rapidly from her post at the threshold to the middle of the room , with a probationary show of confidence and self-assurance . " Amos , your immediate family then consists only of the person you call Cousin Ida , that is , your mother ? " she recited , in the pained metallic voice and would-be omniscienttone of a social-case worker . Amos stared at her with a blank look that concealed faint amusement mixed with fatigue . " For instance , " Carla almost cooed , " where is your father , at this crisis in your life ? " Amos threw his head back and laughed in a kind of paroxysmwhich caught even Ace Chisholm off guard . After studying Rat 's seizure , Ace decided that it must be genuine . Calming down a little from his laugh , Rat said , " Your wife must have me mixed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the whereabouts of missing persons . " Ace sighed uneasily and said , " She 's queer on questions today , sure enough . " However , his tone was less cutting towardCarla than it had been . " Well , I do n't know what 's so funny about what I asked Amos . " Carla looked toward Ace as if seeking further social acceptance from that quarter . " Rat would n't know his father if he met him naked in ap27shower bath , or stretched out goggle-eyed in the morgue . Rat do n't know fathers , " Eustace said , rolling on his back on the floor in one of his relaxing exercises . At this last remark Amos laughed again until his veins stood out in white and green ribbons on his neck . " Since you have no people to help you , I 'd think the universitywould come to your assistance . " Carla spoke with high moral indignation , and then chided the hard times and Amos 's bad luck in particular . Rat shook his head steadily , like a metronome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep his ass out of the cold this winter , I guess . " Ace looked at Amos uneasily , then picked up his Jew 's harp , plucking out a phrase from some old song . " Your husband 's a poor scholar today . " Amos suddenly came to , jumped up quickly and threw the Greek grammar to the floor beside him . Carla stood with her arms akimbo , glancing admiringly from Amos to Eustace . It was clear to everybody she was glad now to be home and glad to have permission to remain in the room . " Maybe if I get a job , " Carla was saying , meditativein that atmosphere of mixed thoughts and poor attention , " if , I say , then perhaps Amos could stay here with us ! " " Ho , a lot you know , " Ace scoffed loudly , glowering at her . " Why , Rat would n't leave the little nest where he is now for all the jobs you could find in a lifetime . Would you , Rat ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pounded his fist into the palm of his hand . " Who is he staying with now , Eustace ? " Carla continued , all concern and bright interest.  |p28Amos  looked anxiously at Eustace , who answered at once for his friend : " Amos lives with a dirty ex-coalminer , who 's a hillbilly and a bully . Ask him to take off that court-plaster to show you how they get on . " At an expression of repulsion and disgust from Carla , Eustace continued his bantering : " Carla ca n't bear the thought of your curls pressed against a coalminer 's chest , Rat . " " For God 's sake , we 'll have to think of something for him , Ace ! " Carla managed to get out , for she had , as a matter of fact , visualized Amos Ratcliffe 's case all too well . " Let 's hope , " Eustace said , " you 'll think up something better for him , Mrs. Chisholm , than you ever did for me . " Carla smiled , brightening perhaps at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gong of the university chapel tower announcedtwelve noon . " About ready for our lunch of hominy and pork butt ? " Eustace announced to nobody in particular , then said directly to Carla , " Rat always takes lunch on our Greek lesson days . " Amos yawned so heavily that they were treated to the sight of every one of his teeth and his pink clear tongue . " I 'll lay the plates then ! " Carla remembered her place and tiptoed out of the room . With clenched teeth Amos fulminated at Eustace : " So all the time you were acting like a great old emancipated free body you were tied down to this cunt , who is back , and you 're glad of it . Gladness is written all over you . " " That beautiful beautiful angel face and that dirty dirty language coming out of it , " Ace said , picking up the Jew 's harp again . " I do n't know what 's going to become of you , Amos dear , unless what your palm says is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . I mean they change , and your death may come by slow freight . " " Dying is the least of whatever is chewing me , you ought to know me that well by now , Ace , " Amos said , and at the sudden look of rapt attention on Eustace 's face broke into another wild cascade of laughing , partly , as all his friends had long ago agreed , to show off his dimples and fine teeth . " You should n't live with that Daniel Haws either . " Eustacementioned the coalminer-landlord now by name . " Whether you 're in love with him or he with you , or both of you with one another , no matter . You 've got no future with him . I mean , Amos , do you have to ? You ought to live with rich people , Rat . Really and truly . You 're a nice boy who 's just acting a dirty part . You do n't fool me at all . At heart you 're really nice , and not who you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-hearted obscene expostuations . " If you cleaned yourself up , " Eustace went on pokerfaced , " and quit fighting to show people you 're not a queer , you might get through the world . Of course , I do n't know . " He studied Amos closely . " You are mighty special . You 're so good-looking and so smart , you 're fairly strong , too , but most of your other buttons are missing . Too bad maybe it 's so , but so it is . " " Whole country fucked to the dogs , so why single me out , Ace ? " " Most people have their buttons , " Eustace continued . " You know what I mean . They get through things without the wear and tear you put on yourself . You 're bleeding every step you take . You 're crazy , Rat , and you know it , and so am I. Only somehow I 'm safe up here with people keeping me , and I 'm writing my poem on old newspapers every day . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sop30vulnerable . " He gave a last look at the court-plaster . " I do n't see how you can make it alone , unless you find somebody to care for you . " " Well , we did n't get much Attic Greek took up today , did we ? " Amos said as Carla came in to invite them to lunch . Amos lived at the back of a red brick building whose front entrance , permanently closed and boarded up for unexplainedreasons , bore the erection date , 1887 . You reached Amos 's room by going up five wooden flights of stairs in the rear . A stormdoor at the head of the stairs opened on the kitchen used by the landlord , Daniel Haws , as his " businessoffice . " Down an interminable hall lighted by a 71-watt bulb was the six-by-nine cell , furnished with an old Army cot and stool , where Amos was at home with his Greek books . Whether coal-mining had anything to do with Daniel 's walnut complexion or not , Eustace Chisholm claimed that , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Daniel was aware of Eustace 's jibe , but the remark only amused him . He said he had always looked dark as far back as he could remember . All year long , even in mid-winter , he looked like a man who had just returned from basking in the Gulf of Mexico sun . " Actually I do n't live with a nigger and Ace knows it , " Amos would say . " I live with an Illinois man like me , a lean wiry fellow . Deep wrinkles for so young a fellow , but wrin/kles look good on him , maybe because he 's all sinew and bones , and anyhow is in a class by himself . He is the landlordof the eight rooms on the top of the 1887 building . " " And the man you have been waiting for , " Eustace would reply and Amos would shrug and say , " Amen , Ace , on that . " Climbing the stairs now two at a time , Amos smiled and talked aloud as if to prepare himself for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Daniel Haws was not his dark coloring , but the striking difference in his character awake and asleep . Awake , he not only never made a single pass at Amos Ratcliffe but seemed to keep a gulf between them all the time . He once said of a newspaper scandal story about two men who had killed themselves over their love that he was opposed to physical relations between members of the male sex , and they ought to electrocute faggots . The very night Amos moved into the rooming house , the mystery of Daniel was revealed  --  he turned out to be an incurablesleepwalker . There were no locks or bolts on any of the roomers ' doors ( Daniel had explained that he must have access to quarters at any time , otherwise they would all be burned to death some fine day on account of the carelesshabits of his transients ) , and at two o'clock in the morning of his first night Amos was awakened by the squeak of the opening door . In the feeble hallway light , he saw someone standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes open , but the expression in their pupils was so changed that Amos did not at once recognize his landlord . Daniel came directly to Amos 's cot , sat down in the manner of a regular visitor , lifted the boy 's head casually , touched his hair and , leaning over him close enough for Amos to feel the warmth of his breath , said , without expression or feeling : " Promise me you 'll want top32stay . " A few seconds after saying this , he rose and returned to his own room , having closed the shell of a door behind him . That had been two months ago . Hardly a night now went by that Daniel did not return , with words and actions nearly identical to those of his first night 's visit . Amos knew that his nighttime caller was as different from the daytime DanielHaws as a dream is from everyday reality . Amos also remembered a description Cousin Ida had given of sleepwalkers : " People who walk in their sleep do n't remember a thing , especially where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other tenants knew the landlord sleepwalked into his room late at night and he felt sudden hot shame that they knew , for they could construe it only one way ; but then , as Eustace said to Amos , " Who after all are the roomers  --  an unknowable , vague assortment of homeless scarecrows , transients of a night or two . " And keeping this in mind , Amos had cheered up considerably , after one sleepless night , when in the kitchen Daniel flaws , preparing him some food " to piece on " between meals , had grinned and said : " Looks like you 're my star boarder , Rat . " And leaving Amos to finish his " piece " on the oilcloth spread , Daniel Haws would go into the adjoining cubicle to do his accounts . One could smell the freshly-sharpened lead pencils and hear the weight of Daniel 's Army ledgers as he flopped them open on the roll-top desk . Had Eustace seen them in the morning breakfasting on the oilcloth-covered kitchen table , he would have conjecturedthey were total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or characteristic in common . Yet there was one similarity between the cold morning meetings and the passionate encounters of dark/ness  --  it was always Amos who looked at Daniel . Daniel 's eyes remained as they were when he walked in his sleep  --  averted . One morning while drinking coffee with Amos , Daniel Haws looked up suddenly , as if feeling the boy 's eyes on him , and said : " Tryin ' to burn holes starin ' like that ? " " Guess I was just resting my eyes on you so as not to look at your wallpaper , " Amos gave a sour apology . Daniel closed the book he was reading , a volume of Rhodes 's history of the United States , and took a careful look at the kitchen wallpaper . " Yes , " he admitted , " that wallpaper is goddam ancient . " He smiled . " But try and buy some new with prices what they are ! Even if I was to paper it myself it would break me . Nobody papers his walls with paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . Know how many wallpaper stores have folded right on this street within the last year or so ? All of ' em but one . Maybe a Greek scholar might not know about the cost of wallpaper , but Daniel Haws ai n't paperin ' his kitchen to please nobody . " After saying this he looked desperately about the room , never once allowing his gaze to rest on Amos direct . " But I do n't know what 's come over you the last few weeks , Amos . The way you stare . I wo n't tell you to stop it , on account of it 's probably harmless , but I want you to know I 'm aware of it , and I ignore it . " Amos smoothed a deep fold in the oilcloth . " I like to look at an American face , Daniel , " he said bravely . Daniel touched his mouth with the back of his hand , and shook his head . " Do you have some little strain of Indian blood in you byp34chance , or do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight of boldness that surprised even himself . Calm under the onslaught , however , Daniel got out : " Do n't know rightly who my ancestors were , to tell the truth . " Daniel rose , pushed out his chest , and having stretched out his arms until the billowing folds of Old Glory tattooed on his forearms were visible through the openings in his sleeves , swiftly strode into his cubicle to occupy himself with tasks Amos described to his face as " doing your arith-metic . " A moment later , suddenly peeping out from amid his ledgers and record books , Daniel taunted : " Stare way , kewpie , if it gives you any pleasure ! " Amos wilted under the remark and turned a dead white . The puzzled landlord looked him in the eye this time , then suddenly angered , wheeled and slammed the door of his office between them . " Does the son-of-a-bitch know he sleepwalks ? " Amos mumbled to himself . But he shook his head immediately . If Daniel had known , he could n't have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . There was another place and time during which Amos could stare at his loved one , unreproved and immune . Every evening for a few hours Daniel I-Iaws got all dolled up and worked as " seater " in the fashionable men 's club patronized largely by university professors and trustees . Danielwould stand at the entrance to the huge oak-panelled room , near the cashier , in his black tie , and nod to one distinguishedold man after another , usher him to his plate and fork , and then go back to the entrance and wait for the next club member . The rest of the time he spent being the landlord of the top of the 1887 building.  |p35So  almost every evening , rain or shine , starlight or fog , Amos walked slowly past the gentlemen 's club and paused , looking in . When he located Daniel Haws at last standing there transformed by " evening clothes , " Amos felt his heart begin to pound so rapidly that he held on to an iron fence post , while tears came to his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing Daniel Haws 's face and body , but with a different soul , would visit him in his cubicle , smooth his hair , mumble words of blind affection , and the visit concluded , stumble cautiously back to his own room for the rest of the sleeping night . Facing one another now across the dark , here again in the raw November drizzle , only Amos saw and understood . Daniel , looking out into the blackness , perceived only the streetlamp , just as later in his sleepwalking he would gaze at the one he loved with unseeing eyes . When Amos turned to Eustace Chisholm for advice , Ace said there was no question of doubt that Amos , alias Rat , enjoyed these nocturnal visits more than the landlord . Sleepwalkingmust take an awful lot out of a man like Daniel Haws , he said , while it gave Amos an excuse for hope and the only kind of love he could accept . " You 're too proud , " Ace preached at Amos , " to make any offer of love or declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give your body to somebody , or turn into a full-fledged zombie . Do n't think this is a bid for your favors on my part , incidentally . You 're not my type , as the pros say . What if you are only sixteen or seventeen ? Old enough to have had your sausage cured a dozen times . Yet you 're satisfied with a man who walks in his sleep and gives you a father 's touch on the crown of your head . " Offended perhaps by the taunts concerning his virginity ,  |p36Amos  pulled out a suspicious-looking handmade cigarette and lit it , perhaps to draw attention away from the tears of anger in his eyes . Ace , however , while not missing the tears , took pains to sniff the cigarette , pronouncing it with a condescendingsneer , Mexican marijuana , which he called the " schoolboy 's consolation . " " You do n't give me no credit . " Amos offered to crush the cigarette , then thought better and inhaled deeply . " And all I can say in conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : never let Daniel find out he visits you ! " Turning white , Amos mumbled , " Why ever not , Ace ? " Ace smiled , Amos crushed his cigarette , there was the cruel kind of Eustace silence , and then instead of the answer , as was his usual custom , this time there was only a grinding prolongation of silence . " Well , when you do say something in reply , Ace , do n't come up with no more of that talk about his being colored . " Amos spoke more out of exasperation at not getting an answerfrom Eustace than a feeling he must claim Daniel for the white race . " I have my own definition of nigger and I 'll keep it , " Eustace said sourly . But his amusement had gone and he warned again : " If you do n't do another thing the rest of your life , my young Attic Greek professor , do n't let D. Haws know he visits you in the dead of night . Better tattoo that on your fists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees up under his chin in his " thinking pose . " Scarcely conscious of Eustace , Amos spoke moonily , " Maybe I should come right out and tell him , then . " Again there was a long uncharacteristic silence from Eustace , during which his tongue and mouth moved as theyp37rejected certain words , moved to take others , then rejected those also . " Maybe , Ace , I should tell him that I love him , I said . " Amos forced out the words not looking anywhere , like a blind man who has lost the direction of where his interlocutorhas placed himself . " Well , Ace Chisholm , " Amos 's voice rose now against the wall of silence , " No cheap cunt-loving cynic like you is going to say that what I feel I am not feeling . I 'm not ashamed to say it , I 'm in love with Daniel Haws and I 'm going to tell him . " " I 'll disregard that little old title you just gave me , Amos , on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm also honest enough to admit I 'm afraid of your fists when you 're in a state like this . . . But as to your confession of love , Rat , in all sincerity I allow it and I praise it in you . " " I testify to love on account of I treasure love , " Amos intoned , releasing the words reluctantly , as a suspect at last admits a crime to some threatening police sergeant . Coming to a sitting position on the floor , Eustace began creeping slowly toward the chair where Amos had delivered his testimonial , and got directly in front of him where he could look up into the boy 's face . " Christ , you really got it , Amos , " Eustace began , " but let an old married friend tell you something straight from the shoulder . You need your Daddy , Rat , and I do n't mean me . Your flesh-and-blood sire . You need him , that 's the long and the short of it . Why , if Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in your face , you 'd die of apoplexy ... " Amos played with the loose nail in his shoe sole . " And if he was to find out you were in love with him andp38he with you , well . . . " Here Eustace 's vocabulary must have failed him for he waved his left hand , and then rose to a standing position , his face averted from Rat . " I would n't be in your shoes for a million bucks , " Eustace mumbled . " On account of the death cross in my palm ? " Amos grinned deeply , perhaps fancying that he resembled Daniel Haws at that moment . " On account of that , yes , " Eustace replied , " and on account of a lot of things . I feel a millionaire is coming to buy you . Did I tell you  --  it 's told right in your palm also ? Then we 'll see if Daniel Haws loves you or not . We 'll see if DanielHaws can walk in the daytime too , if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll see a lot of history if your palm is telling even a bit of the truth of what life 's got in store for you . . . Yes , sir , Amos Ratcliffe , you 've a full schedule ahead . " And so with Eustace 's warning , " Do n't let him find out he visits you , " ringing in his ear like some jammed burglar alarm in a deserted warehouse , Amos Ratcliffe drifted on in his situation . He lived only for the late evening visits of Daniel , incapable of rest until they met together on the borderline of slumber . But because Eustace 's warnings had made him apprehensive , Amos quailed now under the touch he so desired . His dread communicated itself to the sleepwalker and Daniel Haws , noting a change , spoke more volubly , more uncautiously than before , as he bent over the Army cot . " What 's come over you now when I touch you ? " he would complain . Since Amos never replied to him in return , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him the benediction , " Go to sleep then if you 're that scared , " and would leave sooner than usual.  |p39Stumbling  on his way back from his vigil ( for a glimpse of Daniel ) before the windows of the men 's club , Amos ran into the painter , Maureen O'Dell , who acted glad to see him . Her face , from which jutted a nose like Pinocchio 's and a vermilion line of mouth , contained a pair of large blue eyes red and puffy from crying . " You 're in trouble , Maureen , " Amos volunteered . Maureen studied him pokerface and did not reply . She had been kind to Amos in a sisterly way in times gone by , had counselled him , and had lent him money which he never returned . She had not seen him since he had moved in with Daniel Haws , and she recalled that it had been at her studio that Amos had first " clapped up a friendship " with Daniel . Though she had been " soft " on the landlord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them since that fatal introduction . When Amos repeated his concern for her , " What 's your trouble ? " , Maureen scowled , then regaining her good humor , spoke banteringly . " I should be mad at you . Taking my fellow away from me . " She feigned anger . Amos looked away sheepishly . He had nearly forgotten all about meeting Daniel Haws at her studio . And as to " taking him , " well ! He shifted from one poorly shod foot to the other . Then Maureen laughed her old hearty laugh . " Oh come along , Rat . I 'm on my way to Eustace 's house . Going top40have the whole thing out with him . My sorrow , as you call it . You can hear it there in full . . . and you 're indirectly connected in any case . .. " They purposely then tried to talk about indifferent matters , or about topics such as politics and war , and Maureen mentioned that some Nazis were living in her building . Having arrived at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Eustace 's lighted window , exclaiming : " God 's got his lamp lit and is waiting for me . " Still snickering over this joke , on the way upstairs , Maureensuddenly stopped , seemed to break down , and grasping Amos 's hand and guiding it to her belly , said , " Listen honey , before we go up , old Maureen 's knocked up . That 's what I 've come to talk to Eustace about . " After she had cried a bit more , she burst out into her customary hilarity and laughed boisterously , filling the building with echoes . " Do you think old Ace will know a good solution ? " Maureenasked Amos . " He 's a muller , Maureen , not a solver , " Amos said thoughtfully . Laughing still more exuberantly at his reply , Maureen studied Amos 's face carefully and when he smiled at her , said : " Amos , talk about pearls for teeth . . . you got ' em . No wonder the boys go for you , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those pearly teeth I 'd be first in line . " Amos drew back from her then not so much because of the wounding effect of the remark as of her breath 's smelling strong of whiskey . " Give old Maureen a nice kiss , " she asked , and she beganp41kissing him inside the mouth industriously . Her hand strayed to his trousers and with professional speed unbuttonedhim , pulled out his penis , and fondled it absentmindedly . " Small but sculpturesque , " she pronounced . When Amos bashfully put his peter back into his trousers , Maureen 's laughter again filled the building . At that moment  --  they had reached the top of the flight of stairs leading to their destination  --  Eustace suddenly advanceddown the hall . " A raucous company if I ever heard one ! " he sneered . He looked bilious and quite put out . He was wearing only some underwear and because a draft from the street door blew down the hall ( and he had also satisfied his curiosity as to who was making all the noise ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered , Eustace was seated on the floor playingsolitaire , having flung a Scottish plaid bathrobe about his shoulders . He did not look up as they came in . " I reckon you two have been out doing the streets together , " Eustace commented , studying his playing cards closely . " You two sure can holler when you come up the stairs , especially old Maureen , so that all my God-fearing Irish neighbors get the picture of my life reviewed good so they can report me again to the building superintendent . " Eustace looked up at that moment direct at Maureen 's stomach . His eyes lingered there for a moment , then moved back to his card game . " Somebody 's in an ornery temper , " Maureen grunted , sitting down in an easy chair with her coat still on . " I had n't been informed , however , " Ace went on , dealing from a new deck of cards , " that you two cronies were friends again . It always was an odd friendship , but beingp42resumed for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer . " " Right you are , to call it so , Eustace , my love , " Maureen retorted , winking at Amos , who meanwhile had sat down on the floor in a customary pose , and begun as was his customto feel the sole of his shoe , when Eustace bellowed , " When are you going to go to the goddam shoemaker ? " Then without much change of expression , he called out in the direction of the kitchen : " Better make a few extra cups of something hot to drink , Carla , for unless you 're deaf you know we 've got company . " " Carla ! " Maureen cried in surprise . " Is she back ? " " Everybody 's back , " Eustace growled . " Well , I wish you had told me beforehand she was back . " Maureen seemed to sober up . " I 'd have thought twice about bringing my bad news here tonight . Or I 'd thought up a different speech than the one I planned just for you , Ace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maureen , " Eustace whipped at her . " You know it does n't matter a hoot in bell whether Carla hears your bad news from you , me , or reads it chalked up on some wall , it wo n't affect her or you . She has no friends , in any case , so how could she repeat your story except to strangers , and strangers never care enough to repeatanything . So dry up about your sensitive feelings . " " Maybe Carla 's return is an omen . " Maureen seemed to speak from a sudden recurrence of the blues . " Anyhow I ca n't tell you , Ace , not now . " " Maureen got herself pregnant , Ace . " Amos brought it all out in one of his sudden flashes of information nobody ever was ready for . Eustace dropped a card , and looked up . He looked at Maureen 's stomach again as if to check an earlier impression.  | " Here I thought all the time that bulge meant you 'd just been on a long beer binge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So that 's what 's sticking out of you . " He gathered up all the cards , put them away in a metal box , and waited a moment , blinking his eyes . It was clear the news had excited him and , because it was bad news , he gave it undivided attention . " So you 'll be out of circulation for a while , Maureen , " Eustace finally pronounced . " Do n't suppose you know the father . " " Afraid I 'll have to disappoint you there , Ace . I do . " Surprised again , Eustace rose , put his arms through the sleeves of his bathrobe , tied the cord tight , and inquired , " And which of your bedfellows out of so many made such a definite impression on you ? " " Rat knows , " Maureen said , a deadly coyness in her voice . Her statement caught Amos unaware and he dropped the smiling look which the exchange of words between Maureenand Eustace had occasioned . He turned white as a sheet . " Rat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show him one ! " Eustace cried . " Or have you been hoarding other people 's secrets from me , my beauty ? " Eustace turned to Amos . " Well , I 'll be damned , " Maureen exclaimed . " Rat , the little bastard do n't know ! " Amos watched her , ashen . " Father is Daniel Haws of course , " Maureen said softly , not taking her eyes off Amos . Amos rose and went over to the window and looked out . " Now see what you 've done to our little playmate , " Eustacecried in glee to Maureen . Then , gravely for him , Eusstacespoke up : " Guess maybe you did n't know then , Mau/reen , Rat is head-over-heels with Daniel Haws and what 's more his landlord is ditto with him . There they both are , " he spoke to Maureen but addressed Amos , " both of them together hanging by their heels . " " Ace , God damn you , " Amos wheeled on him with hard fists and clenched teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beverage . Turning toward her , Amos raised his right fist and knocked the tray from her hands , then rushing toward the door which he pulled open with such force its hinges gave a sickening groan , he turned to them to say : " God damn the whole pack of you ! " He rushed out of the apartment , down the stairs , but they noted an odd discrepancy in the sound of his footsteps , as though a cripple were running . Then Carla , looking down at the damage of the spilled tray , pointed to one of Amos 's shoes lying by a broken cup and saucer . Staring at the shoe which his wife now held in her hand , Eustace advised , " Sit down , Carla , and try to be as calm as Maureen and I are pretending we are . " Maureen had welcomed Carla back with a silent kiss , while with deft quick sleight-of-hand she took Amos 's shoe from her , and said : " I 'll be back to talk with you both , at length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snot , and give him back his moccasin . After all , he wo n't dare leave the building without it in this weather . " Smiling warmly at Carla , Maureen waddled out the door . Down below , in the vestibule , she found Amos , warminghis shoeless foot and his ass against a radiator , his eyes redfrom angry weeping . Maureen put her arms around him , but he repulsed her . vehemently.  | " Put on your shoe , honey , " she comforted him . " Then sit down here with me on the steps , why do n't you . " Maureen , puffing for breath , had already seated herself . Having put on his shoe as best he could  --  it was missingits laces  --  and giving himself time to pout a bit more , Amosobeyed and sat down next to her . She kissed him on his ear , pulled at a strand of his hair , and then pressed against him . " Just to think , we 've both been in love with the sameguy " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her . " I never dreamed you loved him too . I just thought you moved in with him by chance . " " Oh cut it out , will you ? " Amos began to get up , but she gently pulled him down again to her side . " We 'll both get over it , " Maureen joked . " Yeah , when we 're dead . " " You do n't confide in me at all , do you , Amos ? You do n't confide in anybody of course . " She looked at him . " You 're adrift in a real sea , kid . More even than me . . . Why do n't you trust me a little ? I love you for being what you are , Rat , darling . . . Trust me . " " Oh , Maureen , " Amos cried , exasperated , " quit harping on it , will you ! " " I understand what you 're going through , " she went on . He shook his head wearily . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I 'll help you , " she began her proposal . " I do n't know how I could help you . " Amos scratched his chin . " Ca n't even help myself . . . Do n't believe , come to think of it , anybody ever asked me to help them before . " He broke into a laugh . " Suppose I should feel complimentedthat you think I can . "  |p46He  took out his box of snuff and dipped , not offering her a pinch . " It reminds me of Cousin Ida all over again , " Amos mumbled . " All right , let it remind you , but help me . " " Sure , Maureen , " he said and put his arm around her now . He did n't think she was serious . " You wait though till you hear what I 'm asking of you ... You can back out then , if you do n't want to do it . " " All right , I 'm waiting , Maureen . " " Amos , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , next Monday . " The color went out of his cheeks , and his mouth tightened . He looked dumfounded . " I 'm not surprised you do n't want to . But there 's nobody else , if you wo n't ... " He put his aini about her gingerly . " I just ca n't go alone , " she said , as if to herself . " I 'll go with you , Maureen , so stop fretting . " " I wo n't lie to you , baby , it 'll be awful , really awful . I 've been there , after all , before . Can you take it , I mean ? " " If you can take it , Maureen , I can . " He was decisive . " All I need is your moral support , as they say in the movies , hon. You do n't have to do a thing but go with me , maybe hold my hand . Baby , you will ? " When he nodded vigorously , she covered him with wet kisses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him . He rose now , and walking over to the door rested his hand on the knob . " I 'll have to go back and say good night to Carla and Ace , " she said . Her voice sounded relieved . " I 'll call you then , Amos , for I know you wo n't go back on me. "  |p47More  than a bit awed his landlord was to be a father , Amos kept out of Daniel 's way the days following Maureen 's disclosure , avoiding him except at meals ( there being a tacit understanding between them that Amos would starve if Daniel did not give him daily handouts ) . However , another reason kept Amos shy of seeing much of him : his monthly rent day was coming round and this time Amos had not a dollar to his name . But at last knowing he could not put off a showdown , the boy started walking down the long hail from his room to Daniel Haws 's office on the corner of the alleyway , where the landlord received his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different in his office from the way he did , say , when he sat drinking coffee at the big round table covered with oilcloth in the kitchen , or hosting in the men 's club dining hall . For one thing , in his office he sat on a tall stool which made the perfect globes of his buttocks noticeable . For another , here he was as disdainful and unhelpful as a drill sergeant . Today , lingering like a truant before the office threshold , Amos felt that Daniel Haws looked as handsome as a Pawneebrave in the subdued light from the alleyway . Yet the minute he heard Haws say , " What in the blazing hell do you want ? " he snapped out of his reverie and knew he had come at the worst of times . " Well , Mr. Haws , " Amos began , but he stopped then , cocked his head , listening to the dripping of the kitchen faucet , then went on with : " I 'm behind in my rent as youp48know . " He stepped over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't rightly know when I can get any money . As I already told you , my fellowship expired at the universityand I ca n't find a job because of not being registered for classes , and also because of the economic burnout , as Mr. Eustace Chisholm calls it . " He giggled awkwardly in the face of Daniel Haws 's stony gravity . A yearning flash of the eyes warred with his angry mouth as the landlord replied : " But being a deadbeat do n't interfere with you being able to laugh , does it ! Or with that peachbloom complexion of yours ! " He leaned toward the boy threateningly as he spoke , and his Blackwing pencil which he had been holding tight in his grasp , broke unexpectedly and fell to the floor . Amos stooped to pick up the pieces , but the landlord in angry haste retrieved them . " Well , do you want me to move out , Mr. Haws ? " Amos Ratcliffe said . " Mr. Haws , chicken shit ! " he roared at the boy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little snot . . . You 'll Daniel me or you 'll call me nothing . I know you , damn you , and you know me . What 's owin ' the rent got to do with pretendin ' I can be Mister to you . " " Then you quit actin ' like the Lord and Master with me , if you want to hear me call you Daniel ! " The landlord listened , incredulous , like a traveler who fancies he has heard a familiar voice in a lonesome stretch of woods . " I asked you do you want me to move or do n't you , Daniel ? " Amos advanced a step toward him . " Well , do you or do n't you ? " he came close to a tone of command . Daniel Haws 's dimming eyes looked glaucous , almost sightless.  | " I could use the room , yes . " He mused over Amos 's question . He suddenly braced himself against his desk , and threw back his neck into the cupped support of his hands ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in full outlines and Amos , watching , lost the thread of the conversation , until Haws , flushing at the rapt pair of eyes fixed on him , exclaimed : " Christ , it will be a relief frankly to have you and your damned staring puss gone ! " " Well , then , I 'd best pack and leave , Dan'l , and you 'll have to trust me for the rent , I guess , till I find a job . " " You child prodigies ! Why do n't you stay home with your folks until the pot ring is off of your ass . " Amos 's mouth trembled . Daniel 's eyes moved swiftly away from him , lit up suddenly like an idol 's from a torch within its empty insides . " I 'll be packing to get , then . " Amos started to go . Haws cleared his throat peremptorily to detain him . " I do n't suppose a scholar like you would be amenable to working around the house for your room , " he spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I charge you for your room , by the by ? " the landlord inquired , and he took down his ledger from a shelf . As if , thought Amos , the bastard did n't know then and there how much he charged . " So two and a half is the pitiful sum you 're giving for that nice bright front room of mine , " Daniel mumbled , looking at the ledger and closing it . Turning his back on the landlord , Amos rubbed his neck , for he could feel a bad headache coming on . " Would you mind facing around when I talk to you , " Daniel cried . Amos wheeled about . The look of raw hurt feeling on thep50boy 's face caused the landlord to halt from further speech for the moment . " See here , Amos , " he began after a silence in which one could hear them both breathing , " give me eight or nine hours of your time a week , doing odd chores , and you can work out the rent for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Amos said . " I 'll put you in charge of mopping the floor every morning , keeping the bathroom spick and span , washing all the windows every few days or when there 's been a bad rainstormor sleet or snow . And you can make my bed . Change the linens and so forth . " " Fine , Daniel , " Amos nodded . " While I 'm about it , though , "  --  Daniel Haws looked up wildly at the molding at the top of the room  --  " I do n't mind telling you it do n't please me a little bit the way you 've been coming home lately . You have this peachbloom face and fancy higher education and yet you live on the street . Come in the other night with one of your shoes off . Hardly a week goes by you do n't arrive with a black eye or scratched up and bruised . . . " He looked at Amos now with an appraisingindignation as he might have at an expensive piece of his furniture someone was subjecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world you 're tough in spite of your peachbloom face , " the landlord continued , and he paused on the word peachbloom as if it was this quality he would tear from all creation . " Well , let me tell you , " he pointed a finger , " you do n't fight no more while you live here or you can clear out . Get me ? Now make yourselfscarce on account of I 'm pressed for time and I 'm behindin my work and do n't you come in here again without you knock . Hear ? " " I 'll shake then on our agreement , Daniel , " Amos Rat/cliffe extended his hand . Daniel Haws looked at the proffered hand , a bitter twist on his mouth , slowly extended his own hand , and then with extreme cautiousness took Amos 's in his , but without enthusiasm . " I do n't suppose you have any Indian blood in you , do you , Daniel ? " Amos Ratcliffe inquired . He seemed to stop drawing in breath as he waited for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that such a maladroit question had , if anything , pleased the landlord . " I 'll write the Department of Interior about it . " Daniel grinned . He gave the boy then a long look like that of a man trying to recall a name or face he can not fix in his own complicatedmemory . " But I 'm not an Indian-giver though , if that 's what you 're driving at . " Daniel went back to his old bitter suspicioustone . " No , sir , when I give a man something , he gets to have it for keeps . " Amos nodded , then taking his leave , walked down the hall . Back in his own " bright front room , " he put his head down on his study desk and pressed his eyes against the wood . Some few minutes after the men 's club had closed and its lights were extinguished for the night , the millionaire son of millionaires , Reuben Masterson of the North Shore , stone drunk , was being helped down the steps by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The helper was not one of his servants , but improbably enough Daniel Haws . The ill-assorted pair were advancing , not in the direction ofp52Masterson 's country estate , the usual path he followed after a fling , but to the landlord 's own " roost . " Masterson had arrived at the club fairly intoxicated . By generous helpings from his pocket flask he had become uproarious , then sick , and finally passed out after vomiting on a newly upholstered sofa . The club steward , Mr. Fogarty , not being able to rouse Masterson from the rug on which he lay sprawled , and being too old and infirm to take command , asked Daniel Haws to assist this " scion of a great American family " and member of the club 's board to bed  --  somewhere , anywhere , Daniel 's own quarters if possible . Daniel protested , but Mr. Fogarty insisted . He reminded him of the number of young men who would give anything for Daniel 's job , and in the end Haws not only complied but came close to saluting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task , Daniel walked smartly to the men 's lounge , on the floor of which Reuben Masterson still lay stretched out , a deep grin on his mouth , a thatch of brown hair over his eyes . Intent first merely to gauge Masterson 's weight and height and deduce how best to carry him to his flat , Daniel paused a moment to study the man in his charge . He grunted with disapproval at what he saw : ReubenMasterson had that indefinable character of wealth about him which the coalminer 's son prided himself on alwaysbeing able to spot  --  the unconscious man looked too young for his years , there was too much color in his flesh , and too little expression on his pudding-like face  --  even his wrinkles , Daniel felt , were bestowed on him from fat living rather than by thought or care . Daniel turned back suddenly to Mr. Fogarty , who had stayed at a convenient distance , and put on such an expression of high scorn that the official left the room in dismay . Daniel squatted a moment in preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America'sp53front families " none too gently , as he might have a side of beef . Masterson , awakening suddenly and struggling to be free , caused Daniel to fix his charge in a kind of modified but savage full-Nelson . Awakening in this unusual posture was not too surprising for Masterson , who was frequently brought to consciousnessin unfamiliar places and unfamiliar arms . He was now partly reassured by familiar surroundings and by the recognition of his rescuer as the personable " host " he had so often nodded to in the club . He had valued Haws , however , as a model of the male servant rather than someone to spend the night with , but now he found the closeness of his presence a more than agreeable sensation . " Mr. Fogarty has suggested we go to my place , sir , in view of it being so late , " Daniel Haws spoke with surly militarydeference and politeness . He had freed himself from Masterson 's embrace , but waited uncertainly at a convenientdistance away from the drunk man as he weaved unsteadilyfrom one foot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , belchingand attempting to focus his eyes as best he could . " Do you think you can make it , sir ? " Masterson considered the question , then throwing his arms emphatically upwards , cried : " If you 'll be around and about to give me a needed hand , do n't see why I should n't be able to make it again and again ! " Arm in arm the two , after repeated fallings and risings , hoistings and proppings , at last made it to Daniel 's alleyway staircase . Then up those unsteady steps , while Masterson cried out in terror as he looked down the sickening height , and Haws 's neighbors leaned out their windows and shouted and cursed . " Never you mind now , sir , " was the phrase Daniel hadp54selected to encourage the reeling man forward , but after hearing it repeated five or six times in a row , Masterson expressed his boredom with it by an acidulous remark which shut Daniel up . Inside the apartment Mr. Masterson collapsed on the kitchen floor , and Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to his guest , still supine , much in the manner of first-aid . Masterson indicated several times he would appreciate his host 's sharing out of the same cup , but Daniel sullenly refused . After more tugging and carrying , Haws landed him on his own bed . Undressing his guest might have been less prolongedhad Daniel 's amazement not grown with each article of attire he removed . The son of coal miners had never seen such material , let alone handled it , and his resentment of his visitor 's wealth was finally replaced by pure astonishment : the imported silk cravat , the hand-stitched shirt with monogram , the pure silk undershirt , embroidered shorts , cashmere hose and Scottish shoes weighing like gold ( though probably , Daniel muttered to himself , made of a bull 's pizzle ) , all this finery reduced him at last to sober silence . Stripped bare , Mr. Masterson showed plainly that he had been seriously wounded , one supposed in the war , and these unsightly gashes , together with the traces of what had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total dislike of him . Just as Daniel was tucking in Mr. Masterson , the magnate'sgrandson threw his arms about him ardently and gave him a watery kiss . Drawing back , Daniel wiped the kiss off with slow thorough caution , then somewhat limply set himself down on a small crate he used for a chair . He seemed lost in reverie , or as if reviewing the events of the evening.  | " All right , I 'm sorry , " Reuben Masterson spoke up . When no reply was forthcoming to his apology , Mastersonraised his voice : " See here , Daniel , God damn it , I said I was sorry ! " " People will do anything when they 're drunk , " Daniel brought out in a whisper , after a struggle to say even this . " That 's where you 're wrong , honeybunch . " Mr. Mastersonturned ugly . " Do n't think I 'd kiss a brick wall do you , no matter how much liquor I 've put under my belt ? No , Haws , it must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck Masterson across the mouth . Mastersonlet out a cry , prompted in part by the spout of blood which now came from his mouth onto the army blanket covering the bed . Amos Ratcliffe entered the kitchen just as Reuben Mastersonbellowed , and since the door to Daniel 's bedroom was open wide , Amos lingered at the threshold , incredulous at the scene before him . Daniel Haws shot a glance at Amos which combined rage and hatred for the drunk man in his charge , and sudden betrayed passion for the boy at the door . Amos , in exchange , gave Daniel a look of injured trust . For a moment the two men stared at one another with no pretense at disguisingwhat they felt . Then Daniel 's hands fell at his sides , his eyes shifted to the wall . " Mr. Masterson here became sick at the club , and I was asked to help him , " Haws explained lamely , for the first time defending an action of his for Amos 's benefit . " Then all I can say is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and walked out of the room . " Amos , " Daniel commanded , and in a lightning movementcaught up with him in the hall , grabbing his arm andp56pulling him toward him . " You 'll help me with this rich sonof-a-bitch , or I 'll know the reason why . Do n't act to me like you was keeping a big bank account and could afford to be your own boss . " " Help him yourself . I scrub the floors , not nurse your pickups . " Haws slapped Amos 's face smartly twice . " You 'll help me , or I 'll break you , " he breathed into Amos 's violently flushing face , then turned back to his bedroom . Amos stood a moment immobile , his hand making incipientmovements to reach up and touch the places where the hard hand had struck him . Then turning suddenly white , his mouth quivering , he walked quickly back into the room where Masterson lay . Looking up from a basin held shakily for him by Daniel , Reuben Masterson 's eyes fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up thickly but jauntily : " Do n't tell me , Haws , we 're to be rewarded with a second glimpse of this angel in one night ! " Haws instead of replying removed the basin angrily , placed it on a tiny commode , and began wringing out a washcloth stained with blood , a kind of grim satisfaction on his mouth . " Daniel , at the risk of getting another wound , may I ask you to introduce me to your god-like young visitor here ? " Haws snorted a kind of laugh in spite of himself and said , gravely apologetic : " I 'm sorry I hit you so hard , Mr. Masterson . I only meant to sober you up , frankly . " " You already apologized enough , Daniel , but since you 've beat me up you may as well call me Reuben from now on . I do n't harbor grudges . " Then speaking directly to Amos , he said : " Let me introduce myself  --  "  |p57But  at this moment Daniel interrupted by stepping between them with : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Amos , meet Mr. Reuben Masterson , whose name you must have heard at the university . " Both Amos and Reuben were wonderfully struck by the dignity and poise with which Daniel had made the introduction . " Now let me bring you some medicine for your cut mouth , sir . " Daniel nodded in Masterson 's direction , and hastily left the room . There followed a silence which a casual observer might have thought " embarrassed " but which was explained by Masterson 's contentment merely to feast his eyes on Amos and Amos 's complete absorption in his violent feelings for Daniel  --  indeed he was barely conscious of where he was at that moment , let alone of the presence of another person . " I hate to think what I must look like . " Masterson jarred himself out of his reverie and guffawed . In a still deeper reverie , Amos barely nodded in response to the guest in Daniel 's bed . " Haws spoke of you as being at the university . . . Did he say your last name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall something , but got of course no prompting . " I 'm over at the club some part of the time , " he proceeded . " I 'm on the board of trustees and such , " he laughed again , " but I do n't believe I ever set eyes on you before . . . " Still barely attentive to this voluble attempt at conversation , Amos lifted his hand to the place on his cheek where Daniel had struck him to feel a slight welt rising there and replied : " I 'm not in school now , for your information . "  | " You did n't graduate certainly , " Masterson spoke heartily . " Not at your age ! " " Ran out of money . " Mr. Masterson giggled , as if the improbable had been wittily mentioned for his amusement . Then he sat up in bed and shouted : " But you must be the Amos Ratcliffe Maureen O'Dell spoke of some time back . Of course you are ! " Amos looked up now , a bit more attentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for ages , and here we are together before she could plan our formal meeting . " Suddenly , whether from the closeness of the room , the unexpected presence of a guest in Daniel 's inviolate bed , or by reason of the sight and smell of blood , Amos felt quite giddy . In order not to fall , he sat down beside Masterson . IIaws entered at that moment with a tray of medicine bottles and some absorbent cotton . Rising from the bed at the stern look of reproach Daniel gave him , Amos stumbled , keeled over and fell heavily to the floor at Daniel 's feet . " Christ 's sake , hospital night ! " IIaws cried in a strange contortion of voice and features . " Now look at that little bastard , would you ... " He kicked Amos with his foot . " That 's about enough of that , you goddam brute ! " Mastersonjumped up . " You can sock me all you want to but do n't you touch him again , or I 'll have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Handing the tray to Masterson with a murderous look , the landlord kneeled down over Amos , who was obviously , he saw , not play-acting . Something in Daniel 's attitude silenced Masterson also.  |p59The  landlord lifted Amos up in a kind of ritual slowmotion , this time not needing to compute the weight of what he was to carry , then bore him deliberately down the hall and into his own room . Amos was heavier than he looked . He put the boy down on his cot , then rose as if in forgetfulconfusion over something and shut behind him the door unequipped with a lock . Bending over , he first made the motion to undress Amos , but a shudder of such violence went through him that he had to wait until he could steady himself , then merely put the boy with his clothes still on securely under the blanket . Suddenly the landlord froze over the unconscious form . A kind of sleep suffused his open eyes . His head bent of its own weight over Amos 's body , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment Amos woke up , and seeing his landlord in his familiar sleepwalking guise , did not hesitate a moment to press his face tightly against Daniel 's . The landlord came to with a start , his eyes cleared of sleep . " Do n't leave me , Daniel , " the boy cried , terrified . " I need you to stay , " he pleaded . Rising , wrathful , Daniel gave Amos a long uncomprehendinglook , then with something like terror he rushed from the room . The day after Mr. Masterson 's departure ( the millionaire had remained all day in the grudging care of Daniel Flaws ) , Amos was awakened from a feverish sleep by a surly yell from the landlord , who informed him he was wanted on his office telephone . So drowsy that later he was not certain how much he hadp60heard on the phone , or how much he had dreamed when he had got back to his cot , Amos was at least aware that the telephoner was Eustace Chisholm . Since the day he had moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to be any incoming or outgoing call except in unusual emergencies , and as Amos now listened to the poet 's cascading voice , he was certain that Daniel , bent over his accounts , heard all that Ace was saying . " Guess who has been visiting me and is here right now , " Ace 's voice boomed . " It would seem you are in for a change of luck . . . Speak to your new friend Reuben . " They were both drunk , Eustace and Masterson . Terrified of Daniel 's disapproval , Amos could only watch the back of the landlord 's neck , as motes of sunlight played along his dark skin and fine black hair . " While the department store king is resting now in my big chair , " Ace went on in stentorian tones , " let me tell you straight from the shoulder , Rat , you 've captivated him : Masterson . He 's made a formal bid for you right here . " " Do n't shout , Ace , " Amos got out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I said he 's bidding for outright purchase , " Ace 's voice rose in volume . " And because you do n't know much about the world outside of Greek contract verbs , let me explain to you this fellow is worth only two hundred millions and though he 's been giving me the story it 's all tied up in trust funds , I still gather that about a million a month falls on him from some horn of plenty . . . The mystery is how you captivate hearts , child , but that you do it I 've got to be the first to admit . . . While your new admirer is out of earshot , let me give you some advice . . . You 've got to polish yourself up . . . In cold daylight you might not look sop61good to him , or his grandmother , as you did the other midnight . . . Take your credits , first . . . You 're handsome , lovable , smart as a whip , come of good old American stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . So much for credits . . . But your debits , Rat . Hear me out and quit groaning . . . I ca n't believe you were in such a bad state even when you left your Cousin Ida 's as you are now . . . You 've gotten common and phony tough and all on account of you will imitate your landlord . . . And where you have n't followed him , you 've done , in most cases , worse ... Let 's quick take one instance , your landlord wipes his fundament forward toward his balls . ( I know from the days he came here while courting Maureen O'Dell . ) Ditto now you , as I observe , though when you first went to stool at my place here prior to your Haws period , you wiped your ass with a backward swipe like a gentleman . . . You imitate Daniel also in sucking in your guts ( his military training ) until your navel connects with your backbone . This do n't suit your personality . . . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is the son of a long line of coalminers , an ex-soldier , and scrubs himself clean as only a man who hates himself can  --  with kerosene and scouring powder . . . You , Amos , on the other hand , who have aristocracysomewhere in your veins , are dirty . . . Look at your nails . . . Or your ears , all beeswax thick , or your downy cheeks , and your neck covered with scurf . . . Only somebody as good-looking as you could retain your charms so soiled and grimy . . . What I 'm saying is you 're not salable as you are now , so wake up while you 've got a lifetime'sgold chance . " Suddenly Eustace 's voice faded on the wire , and Maureen'sboomed.  |p62Daniel  threw down a piece of eraser . " Do n't forget our date together , honeybunch , " Maureen reminded Amos of his promise to her . " It 's a blowout ! " Amos appealed to his landlord . Springing up from his stool , Daniel , who had obviouslyheard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strode into the kitchen , where he still kept within earshot . Eustace now came back on the wire . " Why should you let yourself go down the drain now , Rat ? " the poet 's voice boomed again . " You 've got everything to bargain with . Will you be a drudge to your landlordwhen you could be sporting a diamond ring and twelve changes of suits ? . . . If you wo n't look out for yourself , then old Ace Chisholm has got to . . . You adopted me when you began giving me Greek lessons . There 's this ancienttongue between us . You do n't need a coalminer glorying in his power over you . " Coming into the cubicle now , Daniel took the phone and slammed the receiver down . Amos stood silently and bent down his head either to show gratitude or allow himself to be cuffed . Back in his own room , some hours later , Amos woke from a hectic fevered sleep and saw Daniel coming toward him bearing a tray of food . Uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then heard Daniel 's full-bodied voice say , " Here 's your supper , try to taste some . "  |p63'When  " pay day , " as Maureen , in her cups , liked to call it , finally arrived , it found her in her studio , whitefaced and mum , completely sober , clutching Amos by the hand . She kept her eyes carefully peeled on the dime-store alarm clock , ticking loudly away . Her appointment with the abortiondoctor was in just one hour . Amos did not try to break her silence . His eyes roved about . Maureen 's studio , divided into two rooms , was locatedon the sixth floor of a tenement that looked out on another tenement as like it as two peas in a pod . The part of the studio where they waited contained her easel , paints , bottles of turpentine , and her bed ( " whence all the joy and trouble stems , " Eustace Chisholm had said of it ) . This commanded a central position , and covered now with a handsome flower-embroidered quilt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two rooms was the one that now adjoined them . I-ler " waiting-room " Maureen named it because nearly everybody who " waited " there ended up in bed with her . This room contained a collection of ancient rockers , wood statues of Indians and of blackamoors holdingrings for horses . There were also her own unsold oils whose subjects ranged from Maureen herself at midnight to scenes of ruined slaughter-houses , pool-room interiors , prairies and corn fields , skies and lawns without depth or perspective . On the floor and walls of the rooms battered linoleum and calcimine , respectively , met in grimy embrace . Breaking into speech at last , Maureen wondered nervouslyif this were her third or fourth " pay day " comingp64up . Liquor had begun to tamper with her memory , she felt , and that was the reason she was not going to take a nip today before going to the " doctor . " Of course it had all been Eustace Chisholm 's doing , she claimed . He had been her mentor for sexual freedom , had preached and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course he had not been as serious , ever , about her as he was now about Amos and Daniel . True , Eustace had freed her from her Christian Science mother , and from the deadly existence she had led in virginity up to the late age of 23 . But perhaps she would have been happier as an old maid in Christian Science , who knows now ? Whether , however , it was her third or fourth abortion , today it was somehow her most important , and probably her last . She felt fatality in the air , that 's why she had purposely made the bed a kind of flower-covered couch in case it would be the end . She hoped she would die . Anyhow look , she was getting on , she was 27 years old , an old woman by her own standards of judging . Of all those who had passed from the waiting-room to the workroom in her studio , it was Daniel Haws she had loved , however briefly , the most . Hated him now of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him on the cross , and knew one day without the shadow of any doubt , the situations would be reversed , and he would be skewered and drawn and quartered as she was to be today . Yes , that arrogant coalminer bastard must catch it ! " But here I am , " Maureen observed directly to him , " and Amos honey , look how pale you are all of a sudden . " She kissed him . She reminisced at length about Eustace Chisholm 's influence on her life . She had met that bird at a Negro dancehallwhich changed its name every few weeks but was called then innocently The Cotton Patch and offered female im/personators by way of entertainment . Eustace was unmarriedstill , she recalled , and he was debating whether entirely to go down the drain of the gay life or allow himself to be kept by a lady who had applied for the post . He had immediatelyrecognized Maureen as his near-equal , certainly a confederate , and had toasted her again and again while a " girl " from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 33rd Street , in a colored hotel , she had consulted him at length on her future . He had insisted on testing her charms in order to give her the correct advice , but after they had indulged in the act , he told her frankly he was not impressed by her performance , identified her as a " coital repeater " rather than a partner of love , and for all practical purposes still an untrained virgin . He counselled her if she ever wished to become free of her mother and her Christian Science heritage , and if she seriously desired to enter into her own and find fulfilment as an artist , she must give herselfunstintingly to the sexual experience and work at it just as she did her painting , in order to discover its secrets . Mind you , she never tired of informing whoever might be her auditor , she had been initiated into the love act at the ripe age of 23 ( she had met Eustace when she was 24 ) . With his help and encouragement , she had at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour with Amos , she warmed over her old forgotten rage against her mother ( whom she called the Fig ) ; that old dame had withheld any knowledge of the human body from her , had refused to toilet-train her ( here she gave the gagging details ) , and at her first dischargeof menstrual blood had been more dismayed than her daughter , and had steadfastly sworn she did not know what the bleeding meant or what to do about it ( Maureen had had to turn to a neighbor for assistance and comfort ) .  |p66Maureen  O'Dell 's personal tragedy , according to Eustace , was not all to be laid at the door of her mother : Maureenhad been born with the face of a gargoyle on the body of a sylph . Having come to a full realization of her predicament , under Ace 's tutelage , by the age of 25 , she had given up any hope of marriage or an average life . She did not exactlyfollow her mentor 's advice to put a bag over her head and give her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was " decided , " no difficulty whatsoever in persuading any and all young men to mount her regularly . After her " conversion , " she and her boys enjoyed themselves to the limit of their endurance , and Maureen became a tried and true successfulvotary of total sexual intercourse . She was often in bed with a different boy each afternoon , which date was like as not followed by a second tryst with a late-comer for an allnightsession . She finally could not get enough of it and with her commitment a kind of strange beauty flowered over her face and body . Many of the young men who came into her studio now took pains to kiss her on the mouth and throat for their joy in union was as intense as if she had been a film queen . Prior to her first abortion she felt herself indeed a beauty . Frequent diurnal coitus was also inspiringto her primitive American painting , and she became well-known ( at least in Chicago ) for her oils . Her face , as primitive as her work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " serious fucker " became a mere part of her fame . Her mother never found out , or if she did , was incapable of taking it all in , and she glossed over Maureen 's changed way of life , along with her sudden pregnancies and inevitable abortions as completely as she had ignored and refused to comfort her terrified and desperate entry into womanhood . Bringing to a conclusion her autobiographical diversion , she quoted with relish Eustace 's final pronouncement onp67her : " Afraid old Maureen will never please anybody but beginners , but then of course that 's where her big clientele lies , young kids starting manhood . Good for them and good for Maureen . Breaks in our depression boys so they can say they 've at least had their bang when nice girls and whores were out of reach . " She slapped her thigh in uproarious laughter . " Damn old Ace for being such a smarty ! " she shook her head . Maureen took a quick look at the alarm clock , stood up , put on her sheepskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . " All you got to do , sweety pie , is hold my little hand on the way there and whistle to fetch me a taxi when I come reeling out from the operation . . . Ai n't you lucky to be a boy ! No matter who makes love to you , you can go off scot free . Even a dose does n't keep you off the firing line . " She stared at Amos an unconscionable length of time , then under her breath said : " Come to think of it , though , I wonder which of us is worse off ... " Amos 's face turned grave , he paled a bit and remarked : " Because I 'm in love with Daniel Haws , you mean ? " She made a clicking sound with her tongue . " Or maybe because he 's in love with you , " she mumbled . Amos started to expostulate , but she went on : " Well , I 'm not jealous of you two , honey , any more , " and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love . Ready now ? " Pausing again she touched him briefly on the cheek . " One last thing , " and she appeared to make a real effort now to get the words out . " Do n't forget entirely about ReubenMasterson . He 's soft on you good , and unlike Daniel , can give you a hand up if he decides to . Should old Mau/Teen kick the bucket , you go call on Reuben , yourself . He 's ready for you . " She made a funny face then with her tongue to counteractthe look of trouble which had come over his eyes and mouth , but as he still watched with concern , she grumbled , " Oh , for Christ 's sake , I 'm not going to kick off , so do n't act like you was already weighted down with crepe . You can keep a stiff upper today , if I can . " As they left the white neighborhood behind , and walked into the colored section ( Eustace referred to it in those days as " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shared secrets , recent and far-off , fears , and slender expectations . " Are you sure , though , Daniel 's the father ? " Amos blurted out , while Maureen was making one of her frequent stops to catch her breath . " As sure as your mother is of yours , " she replied with unhesitantconviction . Seeing his consternation at this last remark , she quickly amended her statement : " Oh forget the comparison , honey , I forgot about you and your mother . What I mean is , I 'm sure-sure about Daniel . Positive-certain . " She went on : " Imagine that big stiff Haws falling for you . " She studied Amos carefully . " I ca n't be jealous of you somehow because you 're not a woman . It 's a bit beyond me , but since I had to lose him anyhow I 'm glad I lost him to you . Imagine him though in love , even if he sleepwalks for it . He only fucked anyhow to show he was a man . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and army discipline . Head over heels with you . . . Anyhow , I do n't love him any more and that gives me the strength to give up his baby . " As they neared the abortion doctor 's office , situated offp6947th Street and Lake Park Avenue , Maureen , never a fast walker , slowed her pace , and Amos slackened his gait to walk beside her until , shuffling and lagging , they resembled stragglers unintentionally bringing up the rear of a cortege . Their destination stood before them at last , a dingy slatecoloredeight-story structure , entirely vacant except for a half-dozen rooms used for obscure purposes , distributed haphazardly throughout the building . They entered the tiny vestibule . Maureen looked up the black stairwell . " I think I 'd remembered everything about this place except the unimportant little matter there 's no elevator , and where we 're going is the top floor , would n't you know ? " She put her hand over her eyes , and it was Amos 's turn to tell her to buck up . They began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep , and the only light came from the same kind of feeble 7  --  - watt bulb which illuminated the halls of Daniel 's rooming house . About half way up Maureen whispered to Amos that she hoped the baby would come out by itself by the time they had climbed to the top and save everybody all the rest of the bloody bother . But there 'd be no luck for her , she said , she 'd been scorched before and knew how it went . " Do the likes of us ever have any luck or break ? " Amos spoke with an ancient bitterness she had never heard come from him before . She observed him for a moment , then shrugging and goingup a step ahead of him , said : " I 'm nearly old enough to be your Mother , so I can tell you you 'll learn by and by those questions are n't worth the spit to say them with . " Her tone too was one of such unaccustomed strong feel/ing for her that Amos put his arm around her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Maureen to catch her breath and it was then she cursed Daniel Haws good and hard and thundered for his death . When they reached Room 889 , Amos put his mouth to Maureen 's ear and whispered , " What 's the Doc going to look like ? " Maureen lifted her finger briefly to her lips , then her mouth directly against Amos 's face , whispered back , " Black as the ace of spades and twice as baleful . " " I pictured him before I asked you . " He closed his eyes . She nodded , tightened her mouth , and rapped on the door of frosted plate glass . A rasping , shuffling sound was heard directly behind the glass , and a Negro of about thirty-five opened the door on them . His hair had been plastered tight against his skull , and he had on a pale yellow pin-stripe suit and was shod in huaraches . A younger Negro with a zig-zag scar across mouth and chin , wearing a silk stocking over his head , stood near the high window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for two high rough kitchen shelves pushed together to form the operating table , and a small plank with wheels , on the top of which were instruments . " Is this your young husband ? " The " doctor " studied Amos . " Just a good friend , " Maureen replied , nearly inaudible . " Then he got to leave . " The abortionist was decisive . " Oh , please no , I 'll need somebody to help me home ! " " All righty suit yourself . " He grinned and reintroduced himself to Maureen , then , in case she had forgotten his name was Mr. Beaufort Vance , but he kept his eyes for a long time on Amos , like a photographer who wants to keepp71in mind the favorite pose he wants from his subject . After he introduced them also to his assistant , Mr. Clark B. Peebles , he began his set speech : " Now , Miss O'Dell , should you stop living as a result of this very dangerous operation I am about to perform on you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you . Should you on the other hand recover , which I think you will , considering few of my patients very often die , at least that I ever hear of , then ditto , madame , I do n't know you . Clear ? Good . " Maureen had kept hold of Amos 's hand while Beaufort Vance spoke , and she released it only to undress . The two Negroes waited in bored impatience as she disrobed . She handed the pieces of her apparel to Amos , who finding nothing to put them on , passed them to Clark B. Peebles ; he deposited the clothing in a neat pyramid on the floor . Beaufort Vance assisted Maureen , mother-naked , up onto the kitchen tables , where once she was stretched out , he gave her face and body a quick inventory , then producing a hypodermic syringe as if out of nowhere , he administereda shot in her thigh . Maureen made a second request before undergoing the operation  --  she wanted to hold Amos 's hand , and Beaufort Vance granted permission with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted , for she would be fully conscious throughout the entire proceedings . Bending over Maureen now , he pulled up her eyelids and looked carefully  --  it seemed almost angrily  --  into her pupils . " Mr. Peebles , where is my surgery tray ? " Beaufort Vance raised his voice for the first time . Mr. Peebles gave a cry of apology and alarm , hurried to rectify his oversight , and soonp72rolled in the little cart on wheels on top of which some dullcoloredinstruments lay . Amos , in desperation to know where to put his eyes , let them rest for some time on the surgery tray , a performance which evoked in Beaufort Vance a second bitey remark : " Oh , they 're clean enough , never you mind , my very unusualvisitor ! " The abortionist , very tall now , stood at the back of Maureen'shead . Then to the astonishment of Amos , who was the only one who happened to hear it , having folded his arms , Beaufort Vance beseeched Christ the Savior to bless and guide him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face immediately lost its thoughtful look . " Mr. Peebles , where in the flaming hell did you run off to ? " he cried . Then locating his assistant drinking from a flask in a far-corner , he gave out a deafening second shout which reverberated through the empty room next to them . " Get your black ass over here , and assume your position at once ! " he commanded . Mr. Peebles quickly ran to the tables , pulled Maureen O'Dell 's legs wide apart to lift them to the level at which Beaufort Vance indicated , by a waspish movement of his head , then moving his body quickly to one side , he placed one arm firmly under her knees until she resembled a fowl trussed for the oven . He then applied a vise-like pressure . Swiftly coming to the fore to face his patient , Beaufort Vance , with incredible speed , began the operation at once by plunging an instrument into the helplessly open , direfullyexpectant Maureen . Controlling herself for all of a minute , Maureen then let go with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue exploring with his instrument , but mouthed a command : " Tell her , Mr. Peebles . "  |p73Mr  . Peebles turned to Maureen and said : " Unless you stop that yelling we got to gag you . " The operation commenced again , but Maureen 's screams , even more agonized , soon rose again from the kitchen tables . Withdrawing the instrument , Beaufort Vance tiptoed quietly to his former position behind Maureen 's head , and like a man in a magician act , from nowhere , he produced a gag with tape , and fastened it securely over her mouth . " We do n't want no arm of the law in here now , Miss O'Dell . " Then observing Amos standing by Maureen 's side , like a ghost , he seized the boy 's hand and clapped it over the gag . " You can be useful as well as ornamental , " the abortionistremarked . Whether Maureen continued to scream once the gag had been placed on her mouth , Amos scarcely noticed , for his gaze was directed now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suddenly poured out , streaming thickly over the floor . " The amnion , " Amos muttered , horror-stricken , rememberingat the same time that the word meant little lamb in Greek . " The amnion ! " he raised his voice now as loud as that of Beaufort Vance , but nobody heard him , each intent on work or suffering . Whether it was the sight of so much blood flowing as far as his shoes , or the strange insane shock that the amniotic sac had to do with Greek for little lamb , the room shot up before him , and then swam in sickening blackness as he fell heavily to the floor . Beaufort Vance , livid with impatience and anger , bent over him , pulled the boy 's tongue out , held a bottle of kitchen ammonia to his nose , then slapped him repeatedlyp74and pushed his head down forcefully . He inspected a rather ugly gash sustained when Amos had fallen . Then seeing the boy had come to , Vance dismissed his cut as nothing , warned him to sit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not to think he was in a serious way . Squatting in the corner , Amos staunched the bleeding from his cut with a torn snotty handkerchief , helplessly moving his eyes first to the slimy stream of gore circulating under the kitchen tables up to his very position , then to Maureen writhing in torture . Her cries had become feebler , nearly inaudible , and indeedscarcely human . She vomited persistently through the loosened gag . He had taken so little breakfast he could find nothing inside him to throw up , but retched patiently in sympathetic echo to her paroxysms . When she no longer made any sound , he watched with fascinated concentration to see if her breast still rose and fell . At last a cry , ear-splitting and monstrous , broke from her . Her gag came off . Beaufort Vance 's arm , plunged in gore of varying colors , and slime , was drawing out from her body the slashed , battered and decapitated fetus . Amos vomited freely now , groaning and coughing . " Bring me that can over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Faint-I-Ieart , you ! March ! " Amos reeled in the direction Beaufort Vance had pointed to with his bloody hands . Somebody , probably the abortionist , had brought a large garbage can into the room , unobservedby Amos . Amos rolled the can to the place the abortionist indicated , and the latter dropped the bleeding mucous of severedembryo inside , not bothering to close the lid.  |p75Amos  found himself again at Maureen 's side . His hand sought out hers firmly , but she did not return his pressure . " The difficult part of the operation is now about to begin , Miss O'Dell , " Beaufort Vance was speaking . " So please brace yourself . We are going to scrape your uterus . Ready now ? " Amos placed his hand gently on Maureen 's hair , wringing wet with sweat , and resembling under his touch the pelt of an animal . At an imperious signal from Beaufort Vance , Amos replacedthe gag again over her mouth and held it firmaWhile the abortionist proceded now with alacrity , perhapsrelish , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the open garbage can , and he pondered that there lay Daniel Haws 's son , the proof of his manhood . He wondered if he could ever again look Daniel in the face . He wondered if he could ever again think of love . However , he was feeling better , if slightly lightheaded , and his nausea had passed , replaced by a headache , which was for the most part bearable , and he tried to keep his eyes from lingering on the gore and horror about him . Maureen 's body , somehow still attractive in its outlines , now resembled that of someone massacred or martyred , unclaimedin a morgue . Her nipples were black , her breasts unearthly alabaster , her abdomen and pubic hair so stained with blood they resembled a huge wreath fashioned out of torn pieces of entrails . " Oh hon , hon , hon , " Maureen moaned under Amos 's tender pressure , too weak now to writhe or scream . Amos gave a last look at Beaufort Vance 's arm removing from her body a spoonlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing out in bulging relief like a page in Gray 's Anatomy.  |p76Then  suddenly , like all terrible things which seem destined to go on forever , this terrible thing was over and done with . They had been there , not years after all , but only a bit over an hour . As the abortionist pointed out , the time would have been " lots more abbreviated " had Miss O'Dell not been " a ' fraidy cat . " Maureen had asked Amos to fetch her purse so that she could pay for her operation , but when he had brought it , her fingers trembled so badly she could not open the clasp . He opened it then for her , and at her request drew out twenty-five dollars in singles , tied by a rubber band , and counted these into the palm of Beaufort Vance . Lips moving , he went over each and every bill separately , and in fact held up one of them for scrutiny against the feeble light emanating from the blacked-out window . After pocketing the dollars with the remark that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vance ushered them to the threshold , and there repeated his earlier tune . " Remember if you die , I do n't know you , and if you get well , ditto the same , Miss O'Dell . " Just before closing the door , he gave Maureen a last brief glance , and his face relaxed a bit . " You stay out of the jam jar now for a stretch . " Then catching himself looking at Amos full in the face , looked upwards and mumbled , " Can thank our lucky stars no truant officer come callin ' for him while we was all up to our ears in our work . " As they walked down Lake Park Avenue in an even more poky manner , if possible , than they had come up it , Amos observed drops of blood falling in slow succession from Maureen 's skirts . They signalled in vain for the few taxis which did appear , and almost invariably when a cab didp77slow down , the driver found an excuse not to take them . " We 're so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey , " Maureen managed to quip . At Maureen 's behest  --  she claimed she preferred to proceedalone now , at her own pace  --  Amos had run on ahead . In the studio , he turned down her bed with labored care , and began boiling water on the hot plate . After a wait that threatened to consume the remainder of daylight hours , she came puffing in , her hand already nervously unbuttoning her dress . " Home , thank some weird miracle , whether to live or die do n't really matter a tinker 's dam . " She spoke thickly , an indication she had stopped on the way for a drink . She let fall her dress , and greedily sank into the open bed , pulling sheets and quilt over her . Without having to be asked , Amos produced a glass into which he had poured rye whiskey and hot water . He placed the remainder of the bottle on the floor within her easy reach . " A fifth of this in me , and I 'll forget I was ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass , then drank , finishing it in one huge gulp , then helped herself to the bottle . " So you got to see how your mother was skewered and eviscerated , scraped and spooned out , and then not even sewed up but sent home hollow . " She stared up at the ceiling . After a long silence she looked over at Amos . His cut had come open again , and was bleeding thickly . " Yes , " Maureen sighed , " I saw baby 's broken head . " She beckoned him to come near her . " It 's not bad , though , sweetheart . " She inspected him . In a flash she had poured some of the rye on the cut . Amos hollered , and she took his hand.  |p78Then  after a long harrowing silence , her drowsy voice came out of the deepening shadows : " Why do n't you turn on that little table lamp over there next to the pin-cushion ? " When he had switched on the light , she closed her eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would go with me , " she began , her eyes still closed , " and that makes us friends forever and a day . Only you , " she mumbled , " was man enough to take me and wait while I had my guts scraped . Jesus , why did n't that black butcher scrape my eyeballs at the same time ? It could n't have hurt any worse . . . Be glad you 're a man , Amos , even though you do n't go for women . Be glad you got a man 's thing . There 's no future in being a woman after a certain time . Thank God every time you take a look at your little white peter , He did n't make you a woman . Be glad for that all your life , Amos ... Now excuse me . Mama 's going to pass out . . . " Amos sat on as the twilight turned to heavy black outside . When he heard her snoring regularly , he rose , disentanglinghis hand from hers , gave a last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after being mustered out of the army , Daniel went on with his early morning barracks routine . He rose at dawn and took a cold sponge bath , letting the water dry on his flesh as he did vigorous setting-up exercises . He shaved with an old-fashioned straight razor , slapped a coarse smellingp79alcohol over the abrasions , and then prepared a breakfast of fried potatoes , side bacon , eggs sunny-side up , white toast with oleo , and unpotably strong black coffee . As if expectingmilitary inspection in a tent somewhere in Louisiana , he would then work at polishing his shoes . They were already shined so excessively that Amos once saw his own yellow hair mirrored in the gleaming toe . Seated at the kitchen table , and only a day or two after Maureen 's abortion , Amos waited as usual for Daniel Haws to " finish up " in his office-bedroom . Perhaps unaware his voice would carry all the way to where Daniel was , he mut-tered : " What if I was to tell you , Mr. Haws , you were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week ? " Daniel Haws had just finished going over his shoes with a large horse-hair brush , and his hands hung loosely over his knees . He sat immobile , having heard Amos perfectly well . Then he walked to the kitchen and stopped , staring in the general direction of his persecutor . " What did I tell you about callin ' me Mister ? And by the way , what was you hollering about to raise the dead in the middle of the night ? " Daniel frowned deeply , as if he might begin to remember the night now too . " You do n't aim to answer my question , so I do n't yours , " Amos replied sadly , wearily . He had planned the question about the sleepwalking , the plan had failed , but Daniel 's own question now reminded him too of something he had let slip from mind . During the night , after Daniel had paid his sleepwalking visit to his cot , he had had a bad dream and cried out , awakening himself . " Your question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ droning on . " It 's a made-up question besides . "  | " All right , Daniel , I hollered last night because I dreamed Mr. Masterson asked me to marry him . " Amos told the truth , but spoke lightly , as if he had invented the remark on the spot . " That 's a crock of shit , " Daniel cried , affronted , even insulted . He turned from Amos as if a grave wrong had been done him . " You have n't put your hand to a mop or broom around here for days , " he went on . " Look at the rooms . Filthy ! " But the landlord was unable to bring his usual severity into his voice this morning . Then remembering breakfast , flaws went to the stove , pulled forth the huge evil-colored fry pan , slapped six strips of bacon in it , and going to the window-sill picked up the carton of eggs . " Why do you say things that do n't have no substance in fact or truth , telling me you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly cried out . He picked up two eggs , held them in his right hand , carefully smelled them . " Why do you do it ? " Daniel wheeled about , and advancing in Amos 's direction , came up close to him as if to smell whether he was fresh . Coming within two inches of Amos , he suddenly stopped in his tracks and let the eggs drop from his hand to the floor . Swearing his stream of barracks ' oaths , Daniel rushed into the hall , procured a mop , and instead of delegating the task to Amos , went over the linoleum with violent frenzied swipes , howling against everyone and everybody , but somehowoffering this time no hint of violence to his star boarder , who remained at the table , petrified . At the end of his task , however , Daniel turned to Amos and said : " Do n't you ever mention again in earshot of me about anybody walkin ' in his fucking sleep , you hear ? " " Heard you , Daniel , " Amos replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlord but knew that the glance the latter gave him was unendurably terrible . Then in a bewilderingly calm voice , Daniel said : " Now I 'll fry us our breakfast . " Daniel Haws 's life had come to a full halt , almost an end , when he had been separated under obscure circumstances from the regular U. S. Army . Everything for him since then had been sleepwalking , in one form or another . It was Army ceremonies and routine that he seemed to be re-enacting at many times of the day . Both Daniel and his roomers seemed to be under the distant but certain jurisdiction of the military , whose ceremonies and rituals reappeared at every moment of the day from breakfast to bedcheck . The strictness of these rules and regulations had finally driven out all but a few " desperate cases , " such as Amos , and finally he was the only roomer to remain . None of Daniel'stenants had interested him  --  indeed he hardly knew their names  --  until Amos . Unable to take his eyes off the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which seized him was love  --  he regarded it as some physical illness at first . Indeed , from the first beginning and hint of his manhoodhe had always had girls , had passed for girl-crazy in his family , and had continued his fornications like a good soldieruntil the present with habitual tireless regularity . He could not feel he wanted the body of Amos ( who was a thin boy , though his buttocks had beautiful shape ) , but he could not deny to himself in his hours of blinding self-revelationthat he needed Amos , that it was Amos who dictated everything he felt and represented all he needed . That his whole being was now taken up with a mere boy was simply the last of the long series of disasters which had been his life.  |p82The  only things which had held him to life after his separationfrom service had been his Army clothes , his barracks bag , his shoe brush , and his military routine , until Amos . Even now , alone with him in the empty rooms , he felt that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sergeant . But this morning the charge that he " sleepwalked " and had visited Amos 's room , came as a final unhinging of his self . Rushing out into the street , walking at a gait that was almost a run , he contemplated the thought that he might have " visited " Amos in the night . He remembered that he had had some trouble about sleepwalking in the Army , and it had got on his record . Who knows , he thought , perhaps it was his sleepwalking which had spoiled his career in the Army . Now Amos had brought all the old trouble up again . On that day Daniel walked until sunset , through long stretches of beautified forlorn park , past squatting spoiled Japanese pagodas , shadowed by Moorish apartments built for disappeared millionaires , over trampled peony beds . Ever a victim of melancholy , on this bleak fall day without the faintest trace of sun and under a water-blister sky , he reached the depths of his hell . And all the while only the remembrance of Amos 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scaffolding of his life was falling . " I wondered when you 'd come , " was Eustace 's opening remark to Daniel , as he opened his door on the former corporal . " Shit , Ace , I thought I 'd surprise you , " Daniel Haws said . " I wish somebody could , " Eustace grunted , and motioningfor Daniel to follow him , walked out to the kitchen ,  |p83|picked  up his spy glasses from the window sill and began looking out listlessly at the inky black alleyway . Daniel Haws , standing directly behind Eustace , with his hands behind his back in military stance , did not speak . This was his first visit here alone . At other times he had come with Maureen O'Dell , Amos , or someone else . " Do you think we 'll get through the winter , Daniel ? " Eustace inquired with dry meaning . He offered him a cubeb , but Daniel refused it . " Go on , I think you 'll need it , " Eustace prompted . Daniel refused again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know why you 've come , but do n't tell me yet . " Eustacelit his own cigarette , then seeing Daniel made no move to smoke his , blew out the match . Putting his cubeb with some difficulty in his pants pocket , Daniel Haws picked up the spy glasses from the sill and looked out into the pitch dark . " I ca n't help it , Ace , if you 've got second sight , " Daniel said , and laid down the glasses . Taking out a pocket comb from his shirt , Eustace handed it to Daniel . In sudden self-consciousness , Daniel touched his own hair , usually so perfectly groomed , now disheveled , combed it carefully , handed back the comb to Eustace . " Let 's go back into the front room then , " Eustace said , jittery under his calm . " Well , smarty , since you know why I 'm here , tell me , " Daniel Haws finally began , looking at one end of his cubeb . He spoke after a silence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book in French , whose title naturally Daniel could not read.  |p84Eustace  slammed shut the book . " You 're the father of Maureen O'Dell 's aborted son and you are in love with a faggot named Amos . " Daniel Haws stood up , started to walk aimlessly in the direction of the corridor , down which Scintilla raced , then stopped and smoothed the hairs along the back of his neck . Eustace vociferated , " You have a pair of perfectly chiselled nates . I hope your cock is as well sculpt , and you can sell yourself till the conquerors come . " " I could n't be in love with a man , " Daniel appealed to Eustace . " What 's so special about you ? " Ace wondered . " I 've never been , and I ca n't be now . " " You 've never been , and you are . And Amos is n't a man , he 's practically a child , and nearly as soft as a girl , discountinga few black-and-blue spots and cut mouth and shiner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowed under Daniel Haws 's deep tan . " He 's sick with love for you . " Eustace half-closed his eyes like the medium . " So you 'd better sop it up while it 's flowingbecause it wo n't flow forever . No siree . A spring like that is soon dry . " To Eustace Chisholm 's considerable astonishment  --  and he was seldom surprised  --  he heard weeping , and saw that the big " stand-up-fall-down " ( as he called him ) was weepinguncontrollably . Daniel dried his eyes , as one would expect , on his fist . " It 's not worth bawling over , Daniel . " Eustace rose , something quieter in his voice . He picked up a cup of stale black chicory he had left from afternoon , tasted it , then almostgentle : " You 're too old to be in love for the first time and that 's why it 's got you hard . "  | " What do I do , Ace ? " Daniel covered his eyes with his palms . " Tell him you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . " " Let him tell you then . " " If I had the money , I 'd take him with me to some far-off place . " Eustace Chisholm stared at Daniel , incredulous at having heard the last sentence , then , in exasperation , said : " You 're in the farthest away place in the world now , mate . You could n't get any farther away than where you 're living with Amos . You 're in the asshole of the universe and you do n't need to waste more than a half cent of shoeleather to get back . Go home and take him in your arms and tell him he 's all you 've got . That 's what you are to him too , and you 'd better hurry , for it wo n't last for long for either of you , and so why spend any more of your time , his , or mine . " Eustace went out of the room , passed into the dining alcove , and Daniel could hear him twanging on his Jew 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , Daniel Haws walked like a drunken man , now going fast , now slow , stopping to lean occasionallyagainst a lamp post , not noticing or even seeing who passed . Home , he stood in the black kitchen without attempting to turn on the light , near the table at which he and Amos ate . Then without warning a cry came from his lips . It was a sound that he had perhaps longed to utter since his earliest recollection , back to the time in the coal mines , back to his childhood with his mother and brothers , no , further back , before memory , the cry carried him . Helpless , in some paralysis of will and mind , he heardp86Amos 's door open and heard with terror his hurrying approachingfootsteps . A violent wave of nausea came over him even before he saw Amos 's face illuminated by a flashlight at the kitchen threshold . His eye was caught by a tiny gold coin strung on a brass chain exposed on Amos 's throat where his shirt collarwas open . Hurrying past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close the door , but vomited horribly over the bowl , as if now he would part with his guts . He had not heard Amos 's step following behind him , but he felt the boy 's cool hand on his forehead as he went on with his agony . When he had done , he raised his head with ponderous effort to look into Amos 's eyes . Daniel Haws , too weak to turn , his mouth still stained from his exertions , stood rigid while Amos Ratcliffe , his own mouth level with his , kissed him deliberately and then , with still more deliberate grave ceremony , wiped his landlord'slips with a cotton handkerchief . " Leave me be now , Amos , for Christ 's sake , " Daniel muttered , and his knees buckling , he fell dead weight to the floor . " Even if you 're only yesterday 's queen , come in , " Eustace Chisholm greeted Maureen , his voice rising and falling betweenimpatience to hear the latest tidings , and general stony dissatisfaction with his own present lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've just been replastering the wall . It caved in on us yesterday night . " Maureen sat down in mock obedience a comfortable distance from the fresh plaster , against the old deeply cracked and peeling portion of wall . About two weeks had passed since Maureen 's operation , an event pretty well gone over by her friends and enemies so that her appearance now " back in circulation " caused hardly a stir of interest . " You look older , Maureen , " Eustace pointed out , " as you might be expected to , but you 're somehow more attractive than ever before , so watch out . . . Yes , " he added , looking narrowly at her , " you 've developed a certain air of mystery like old Sphinx Garbo manages to give off . " When younger , Maureen had , as a matter of fact , imaginedshe resembled the Swedish star , except that Maureen had great firm bouncing breasts . Nonetheless Eustace 's comment , rare though any compliment was for him , gave her no pleasure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweetish smoke of a black Cuban cigarette , and ostentatiously not offering her one , " I hear everywhere that the nigger obstetricianconsidered Amos the father of your unborn child . " " You hear too good , " Maureen scolded faintly . Hugging her knees with her hands , she mumbled , " If you are n't going to ask me then , Ace , I suppose I 'll have to tell you why I really came . " Eustace pricked up his ears then for he could n't stand secrets . " All right , Maureen , " he chided , " spill it . " " Well , holy ghost , " she said , " somebody is starving to death and too bashful to say boo . " She indicated the hallwaywith a jerk of her head.  |p88Ace  went outside , where Amos was standing meekly , and took him by the arm and led him into the room . " You 've come , lovers , at a pokey-poor time for handouts , " Ace began moodily . " I mean you 've picked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an apron and cook for you two . However . . . " He spoke in such genuine unhappiness both his visitors showed concern . " Do n't sit there and tell me you have n't heard my bad news , " he inveighed . " No , I can see by your faces , you have n't . " He stamped out his cubeb on the sole of his shoe . " Clayton Harms threatened to clear out of here last night after throwing a bookcase at Carla , which I think he meant undoubtedly for me , " Eustace told them . " Hence the plaster over there . Yes , Clay said he 'll leave me behind if I do n't watch my P 's and Q 's . Ile give me a dressingdownthe likes of which I 've never heard of before let alone received . Nobody 's seen anybody like him since the Indians . He 's a maniac when he thinks he 's being eased out . Ca n't take jealousy . I would n't be surprised he 's discovered floating in the Chicago River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance may be over for me for this winter anyhow , and I 'll be settlin ' down with Carla to rock-bottom matrimony . . . " Maureen and Amos muttered perfunctory words of condolence . " All right , so much for busted romance ! " Eustace jumped up , tightened his belt , making an effort , his visitors felt , to look as much like the usual Ace as possible . " Followme on out to the kitchen shelf and we 'll see what I can round up for you . "  |p89Amos  helped Maureen to her feet and they trailed after Ace through the catacomb-like hallway , nearly stepping on Scintilla , who spat lethargically at them . " That cat hates all visitors , " Ace informed them . In the kitchen their host studied the labels on two cans of bean soup , and finally took these down and opened them . " My grocery bill is colossal because of dropper-ins like you two , " he confided . " At least Maureen ca n't use the old excuse any more that she 's eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dream-daddy boarded you . . . Matter of fact I just made a fried sandwich about an hour ago for a young painter name of Al Hall . Had n't eaten in 42 days , he claimed . Thank Jesus Carla is working again . I had it out with her this morning . I 'm losing Clayton Harms 's love ' , I said , because you returned from your adultery-tour and eitheryou get a decent job and buckle down to business or back you go to Kansas City . I married you so I could have a life of my own , and if you 're going to act like any man 's American wife and mother , by God I 'll smoke you out .. . ' She calmed down then and promised to get down to business . . . And another thing I got off my chest  --  " Eustace stirred the bean soup as vigorously as if it were cement  --  " I told her , Carla , it 's not enough you bring us in a decent living , I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the creative one and all the onus is on me to be great . You 're the one of whom all that 's asked is a bit of oil on the machinery . Kindly do it with a little more enthusiasm . Take off that gray mask that has been you so long and let 's see some sunshine and gaiety . . . ' She promisedme she 'd turn over a new leaf then . " Maureen all at once began weeping hard.  | " Cripes , what 's come over her ? " Eustace turned to Amos . " She has these crying jags now every so often , Ace , " Amos mumbled , squinting at Maureen . Drying her face with a man 's bandanna , Maureen managed a giggle , after her own surprising display of feeling , started to speak , could not , then finally got out in one breath : " My body did n't want to give up Daniel 's baby . . . You can put that on your newspaper , Ace . " " That 's about the straightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned the gas down , then off , under the agate saucepan in which the bean soup had been cooking . He put a tarnished tablespoon in the mixture and tasted . " Sample this , " he handed the spoon to Amos , " and be sure to tell me how good it is . " At nightfall , his guests gone , Eustace sat on the dilapidatedCatholic Salvage davenport where he had slept for nearly six months with Clayton Harms , and lighted another cubeb . He felt he might go ahead and bawl like Maureen O'Dell if he did n't snap out of it . His foot suddenly kicked something from under the davenport . Looking down he saw some sort of notebook ; picking it up he recognized Clayton'sold collection receipts-book . From it emanated Clayton'scharacteristic odor , which Ace once described as a cross between nasturtiums and gasoline . He picked out the stub of a pencil within its pages , held it tight , and wrote : " According to Rat , she lay on a kitchen table , looking like a chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with a ladle and scraped her womb dry . Her mother reads Science and Health , do n't know her daughter is a whore &; walks through shadow of death , and not evenp91Maureen saw the offspring of her body but her lover 's love did , with wide-open blue eyes . . . " Helpless under the punishment which rained down on both of them , Amos turned to  --  in the landlord 's sullen words  --  " dating " Reuben Masterson . Though Daniel knew that the " whore " Maureen and the " retired queen " Eustace were behind it all , the looks of bitterness he now exchanged with Amos showed that he felt it was all due to their bad luck , which had been with him and Amos from the beginning . It had begun " for real " one day when the hall telephone rang  --  a rare event in those days . " Who calls us , " asked Daniel , " but wrong numbers and collectors ? " Having taken the receiver off the hook and listened , Daniel took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waited , then still out of breath , called : " Amos , it 's the millionaire juice-head for you . " Closing his eyes while the boy talked and made arrangementswhere to meet , Daniel steadied himself , knowing in advance he would tell Amos to go . " You need money desperate , so see him , " Daniel heard his own words advising Rat , after the boy had come from the phone and explained Masterson was waiting to take him out . Expecting something definite from Daniel , a defiant " no " or a blow from his fists , the landlord 's " go " was the last of crushed hopes and disappointments for Amos , who stood now , his eyes beginning to fill.  | " I 'd rather stay , Daniel . " Amos forced the words out . " And go down the rat hole ? " Daniel managed a grin . " Tell me not to , and I wo n't . " Daniel had heard Amos 's final words from somewhere down the black hallway . When the street door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had to await his own answer : " What if the department store heir decides to keep the goods sent out to him on approval ? " He looked at his fingernails , chewed to the quick . He walked around the kitchen , pigeon-toed , pulled his ears down with his thumb and index finger , and talked cascadesto himself . Daniel thought of the Army then . The word " re-enlistment " came over him like a wave of sea water . He wondered why he had n't thought of it before . His excitement became so intense he had an erection . Amos had not told Daniel it was in Maureen O'Dell 's studio that Reuben Masterson was waiting to see him . He had also not bothered to mention that Maureen too had spokem to him on the phone and " patted herself on the back " for having arranged the meeting between millionaire and pauper . Both Maureen and Reuben sounded pretty liquoredup . A light powdery snow was beginning to fall . Several times , Amos stopped on the wet pavement , and looked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of curtains , filthy window panes  --  all to him were as radiant and precious as the lights of the celestial city . He could not restrainhimself and finally , leaning against a lamp post  --  the same one Daniel Haws had leaned against the night he visitedEustace alone  --  he wept tears as bitter as gall . Nobody but Daniel could have helped to ease his grief , and hep93knew that Daniel was the last person who would ever help in the one necessary way by admitting his love . By the time he got to Maureen 's , both the " painterwoman " ( as she was known amongst her friends ) , and the " millionaire juice-head " ( so known amongst enemies ) , were in a state of high inebriation . An array of young men 's clothing , brand new , still in their store wrappings , draped over Maureen 's bed , immediatelycaught Amos 's eye as he entered . " Damned if he did n't look right away at his surprise ! " Maureen cackled , kissing Amos hard on the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a new gown , an expensive looking ruby-colored necklace , and false eyelashes . Reuben Masterson made a concerted attempt to act sober , and was extending his hand toward Amos , in his most formal manner , stuttering , " So nice to see you again , " when Maureen roared : " Oh you two fellows have got to kiss now . We ca n't have this fancy stand-offish front-family formality here , Reubie , for crying out loud ! " " Oh , Maureen , " Reuben protested with weak grumpiness , " do n't be so bossy ! " " Bossy ! Why , kiddy , I 'm only trying to live up to my part of the bargain of bringing you two together . " She pretended hurt . " You did n't take my talk about us getting married seriouslydid you ? . . . I proposed to Reuben just before you walked in . " Maureen winked at Amos with her new lashes . Refusing to allow Reuben 's or Amos 's backwardness to squelch her , she pushed the two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses during which time Amos 's eyes strayed again to Maureen 's bed where the new clothes were arrayed.  | " We should have put them duds in the next room , so Amos could keep his mind on getting acquainted , " Maureenpouted . She fingered her new necklace . " Everybody have a drink ! " Maureen shouted . " What 's yours , lamby ? " she turned to Amos . " Reubie and I are downing our usual straight gin and lemon peel . " " Guess a little bourbon , Maureen . " " Say , you do n't sound enthusiastic , angel , " Maureen chided . " What 's wrong with your eyes ? You get bouncy now ! Who do you think I arranged this little get-together for ! Me ? Hell no , did n't you just hear old Reubie turned me down in marriage , though he knows I could introduce him to a million good-looking boys like you . " " Well , Maureen , that 's where you 're dead wrong , if you 'll allow me to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks alone make him one in a million , but there 's a lot more to him than looks , if I know anything about human nature . " " Do tell , " Maureen snapped . " Well , have it your own way , Reubie , because after all it 's your party , and I 'm only the caterer . " Maureen could not conceal her growing bad temper . " Supposing then , " she motioned to the clothing on her bed , " Amos starts putting on the glad rags you bought him . On account of , " she laughed nastily , " his ass has never known anything glad on it before . . . " " Maureen , if this is all some cruddy joke of yours , " Amos chided , riled , while his eye rested on the clothing without real curiosity or desire . " Say now , honestly , whose clothes are they ? " he wondered blankly . Both Reuben and Maureen laughed . " Well , they ai n't mine , love , " Maureen cooed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's glass . " Now sometime between sips , kewpie , " she went on to Amos , " may I suggest , to get this party so that it bouncesp95just a little bit  --  I did n't exactly plan a prayer meeting  --  you start takin ' off your old duds , Rat , all of ' em , and while we put ' em aside to burn , you step into the brand new things .. . We 'll help you into them , if need be , " she added when the boy did not budge . " Oh let him change in the next room , Maureen , " Reubenspoke up , and he walked over to the bed , and picked up the underwear . " Who the hell is giving the party , Reubie , I ask you , and who the hell introduced you guys to one another ? I mean really introduced you . I 'm not talking now about you two 's meeting at old Daniel 's fuck-roost , when you were all so pieeyedyou did n't know who put what up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed with pitying contempt for Maureen . " I said strip ! " Maureen yelled . " It 's all right , " Reuben handed Amos the underwear , with fingers trembling . " We 'll close our eyes while you put these on , " he added . Amos took the underwear and laid it on a chair near him . As if to plunge into an icy pool , he swiftly took off all his old clothes , and too determined to get it all over with , failed to observe that Maureen and Reuben did not keep their promise not to look . " It brings back to me somehow our visit to old Beaufort Vance , but why , search me ! " Maureen appealed to Amos who , as she finished speaking , was naked as a robin , and the center of all eyes . " Get a load of that complexion , " Maureen nudged Reuben . " And that cute rosy little pecker . That 's a pecker for the boys to go for , strictly not for girls like me ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rising up , she pushed Reuben toward Amos.  | " Maureen ! " Reuben protested faintly , with his air of what she called front-family etiquette . " Maureen is right , " she warned Reuben . " This is my party for you , you dummy , and so everybody got to do like me ! That 's an order . " " It 's all right , Mr. Masterson , " Amos , waxen , echoed Reuben 's own earlier reassuring phrase to him . " Now step into that thirty-dollar underwear , for Christ 's sake , " Maureen exhorted in a tone so astringent that Amos gaped at her . Although Reuben had just poured himself another doubleshot of gin , he seemed both more sober and considerablyshaken . Putting down his glass , he held the trousers of the new dark blue suit for Amos to step into . Not liking the drift things were taking , Maureen stepped over to her portable phonograph and turned on a Fats Waller record very loud . When she came back to her party guests , Reuben was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do we have here ? " Maureen exclaimed , genuinelysurprised . Indeed nobody recognized Amos any longer , not even Amos . His friends urged him to look at himself in a large cracked antique mirror which Maureen kept at the far end of her room , and he gazed without belief at the person reflectedthere , much as if the unknown mirrored youth might suddenly step out and confront him . " Talk about comin ' into your own , " Maureen cried , besideherself . " Reubie , you 'll never marry me now , will you ? " She broke into angry laughter . " You 've turned that little ragamuffin into a fairy prince ! Christ , let me look away from him or I might damage my retina ! " She kissed Amos , however , carefully on his cheek and ear . " Honey , you 're still about as clean as a chimney-sweep . Ip97bet you have n't scraped the wax out of your ears since you left your home town . And them fingernails . . . We ought to scrub our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparelthem so rich . Baby , " she turned again to Amos , " now you 've come into your kingdom , remember dear old Maureenwho first introduced you to the upper crust . Boy did I cut myself out when I brought you two together ! " As she said this , Maureen reeled forward , and both Reubenand Amos hastened to catch her before she fell to the floor . They helped her to a chair . She sat back for some time , then speaking like a ventriloquist in a very deep voice , she said : " You two fellows get out of here and let a lady be private by herself , why do n't you . Anyhow party 's over ... " Placing a hand-stitched quilt over her , Reuben motioned for Amos to follow him into the adjoining room . Standing by one of the merry-go-round horses , Reuben , more than formal now , nearly funereal , began talking at length to an inattentive Amos . For one thing , whether owing to the generous shots of bourbon or the shock of seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a sense of tenuous diminishing reality , added to which was the heartache over Daniel . But he did hear phrases , as unconvincing or meaningless as all the rest of the evening , coming from Reuben Masterson 's mouth when it was not occupied in kissing . It seemed , according to Reuben , that he was head-over-heels in love with Amos . " I want you to accept these clothes as a gift , but as a gift which is given without any thought of reciprocation on your part . . . I know you are in love with somebody else . I know you are proud . . . You will be doing me the favor in keeping the new suit , and allowing me to give you anyp98other gifts which you will be kind enough to accept . Remember , it is the giver who is in your debt , Amos . . . Meanwhile , know that whatever happens , I am your friend . Lean on me when in trouble ... " Masterson 's high-sounding phrases were succeeded by more kisses , and passionate pressures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I care for you deeply , " the older man said , disengaging his mouth , breathing heavily , " and I can only hope that the day may come when you care for me . Until then , believe you me , you have a friend in me who wants only to help you . This is just the beginning "  --  he touched the lapel of the suit  --  " I 've already told Mother about you , and as soon as you are ready "  --  here he paused , perhaps considering how long it would take to get Amos ready  --  " you must pay us an extended visit to our home in the country , which I hope will become your permanent residence . .. " A cry from the next room made the statues and bric-abracsurrounding the two reverberate and creak . It was Maureen again : " What are you two panty-waists whispering about in there ? . . . Who gave you the right to go off and leave your little fiancee , Reubie ? Quit loving up Bow-and-Arrows and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Dear Maureen , " Reuben whispered in Amos 's ear . " She 's been so kind , and she 's quite remarkable . A wonderfulperson . And I must confess , dear Amos , I did propose to her awhile back . But nothing now can replace you in my heart . " Amos stared dumfounded at such a simple , open , and unconvincingdeclaration of love . It had come somehow too late , or at the wrong time and from the wrong quarter to make him feel it , and pulling away from Masterson hep99walked over to the window , from which he could observe a heavy snow falling . " Say , God damn it , Reubie , what 's afoot ? " Maureen 's voice came still more vociferous . " Get in here and freshen my glass . You 've got lousy manners for the son of a frontfamily , and just a hour since we 're engaged . . . " " I love you , Amos , remember , " Mr. Masterson whispered , and he went into the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly how many days Amos had been gone , partly because he did not sleep at all during his absence , so that the elapsed time appeared as day and night merged into one . Later he figured it was only two days and a night . He found he could not do the work he had painstakingly scheduled for himself  --  he had enrolled in an evening course in mathematics at the university in preparation for his hope of re-enlistment in the Army  --  and besides neglecting his books , he failed to show up for his job as host in the men 's club . For the first few hours of Amos 's absence , Daniel from time to time would go and stand sheepishly in front of his tenant 's room . Had an observer caught sight of him , he might have supposed the door bore a heavy bolt and lock and that the landlord was puzzling how to force it , whereas a mere puff of air would have sufficed to blow it gaping wide.  |p100At  last not even bothering to think of an alibi  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him pause  --  he opened the door and walked in . He held his breath as he crossed the threshold . Perhaps he expected to see someone awaiting him there . With trembling fingers he opened the tiny clothes closet , and once he came behind its frail panelling , in the manner of someone who visits the habitation of a loved one just dead , he held up Amos 's few clothes , piece by piece , and finally pressed one of the soiled shirts to his mouth . Sitting down at the boy 's desk , which Daniel himself had made for him out of used lumber , he opened the partly broken drawer and took out a bundle of letters from Cousin Ida to Amos , tied together with a Woolworth red ribbon . Looking back at the open door briefly , he slipped the ribbonfrom the packet of letters , studied the dates of the postmarksto see whether they were in chronological order , picked out the earliest of the letters , slid out the single page of ruled tablet paper , and greedily scanned the contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mind it began for I feel you are too young to be living in that wicked great place , with nobody to guide you and the people you write about , precious , are too old and worldly-wise , too lacking in lovingkindness to be good examples . I am surprised your professors take so little interest in you , and why oh why your fellowship was not renewed when you need it so bad , I 'll never understand . Come home , Amos , and let ReverendMcllhenny find you something to do here . I know you do not like the church , but you was born into it , dear , and you may one day want to return to it . I do wish you had belief in a Creator , for it would make things easier for you , and it is a rock to fall back upon . I do n't think I could get through life without my faith . You ca n't feel angry withp101your old Cousin Ida if she goes on praying for you . It may do some good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you never wanted for a thing . I know it 's hard to rise above depressingcircumstances and going without , yet we must look on the bright side , Amos , for though these are terrible times , we do have a President now who is trying to do something for us common folk . . . " Daniel Haws crumpled the paper in his fist , then catchinghimself , smoothed it out carefully , and replaced it in the envelope . He stood up , went over to Amos 's cot , kicked the legs of it haphazardly , looked at his drug-store wrist-watch . " Come back , God damn you , " he apostrophized the absent boy , " or I 'll kill you ! " Then unable to resist the packet of letters , he picked up another gingerly , peeked at its firm hand . Sitting down this time on the floor , he soon was reading omnivorously : " You remember old Mrs. Henderson who lived down by the refinery . She was found dead in bed early yesterday , had been dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than lonely old age , that 's why I keep busy , dear , and have my house full of roomers . . . If your father had done the right thing by you , Amos  --  I do n't say anything about the way he treated me , but if he had looked after you as a real father should , but he 's never shouldered any responsibility to nobody , and I hear he still goes about spending all his dollars on the race track and worse . . . " When are you coming home , Amos , dear ? I 've kept your own room ready for you , never rented it to anybody , and it 's just the way you left it , with your pictures and books all kept in nice order and dusted . . . I think of our good times together . . . Always remember there is a place herep102for you ... But do try to come home , the years are running out . . . " I worry so , Amos he turned a page I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible dream about you . I thought you had got lost in some woods that looked to me like the old Shaeffer property down by the quarry , only it was now a terrible looking green like maybe in some far-off island , and it seemed something was there that meant to harm you . This dream was so terrible I woke up , my face was bathed in tears , and I was calling your name . . . Do n't give it a thought , dear ... Old age is catchingup with me , I guess . . . " On and on Daniel went until he had come to the final lines of the last letter . If Amos had come in the door while he was reading the letters , somehow Daniel knew he would have surrendered and would have stayed with him and gone crazy and been happy crazy . But Amos did not come in the door , and in a little while Daniel would leave forever . Just the same he remained in his position on the floor for some time , motionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ida rising at five to do her washing , trampingabout by the morning-glories and sunflowers , hearing the hermit thrush , chasing away all the bluejays who dirtied on her fresh sheets , and every evening , in time for the night train for Chicago , penning a message to Amos . . . Slowly standing up , carefully putting the letters all back in order , with their ribbon , in the drawer , Daniel looked out of the window to see the lights of the Badger Tavern red in the darkness . His wrist-watch said i r P.M.In one of his lightning-like decisions , Daniel went back to his office-bedroom , opened a battered foot-locker at the basep103of his bed , pulled out a handful of bills from a huge book that must have been a family Bible , put the money in an envelope and stuck it in his pants pocket . Without bothering to put on a jacket or coat , he went out into the streets , foul with slush . Shivering in his shirt sleeves , his breath coming out in thick white clouds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maureen was speechless when she opened the door on the glowering hulk of Daniel flaws . " Do n't go off on one of your jawing tirades now , " he raised his voice sharply . He pushed the envelope into her hands , warning , " I do n't have no time to hear talk . . . I 'm leaving Chicago tonight . " He pushed past her , entered the studio , and peered about him , his pupils small and scintillating . She held the envelope in both her hands , still standing at the threshold . Entering after him , she growled : " Is this a love letter for somebody ? " " Do n't tear it up , Maureen , " he admonished , edging over to the second room , and giving it a searching glance . " It 's money . For you . " Turning about and facing her , he said , " It 's a bit late to give it , but better than never . I imagine you can guess what it 's for . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and denomination of the bills within . " I do n't need this money , " she said , not recovered from her surprise . She put the bills down on an end-table . " I did n't want to leave with any debts outstanding , " Daniel managed to get out in the face of her growing surlinessand anger.  |p104She  tightened the cord to her wrapper . " And you think this God damned noble money makes up for what you put me through ? " she exclaimed . " I told you back then I 'd marry you , " he mumbled . " Oh yeah , and you meant that real good and hard , did n't you ? Sincere , that 's you . Daniel , for Christ 's sake . " And she let out a cry of exasperation , turning away from him . " I 'm going back to the Army tonight , " he said , clasping his hands in front of him . " Does the Army know this ? " she sneered . He folded his arms now , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's keeping you then ? If you 're paid up and your conscience is salved with this dough , get along then . . . Or , " she added with savage and unpreparedwickedness , " are you hanging around with the hope somebody you half-expected to see here might show up ? Well , he 's gone . . . Two days ago ... " When he did n't budge , she could n't help going on : " Oh you 're not too bad a cuss as they go , I suppose . . . You 're one of the strangest men I ever met . No , take that back . You 're the strangest . But I know you did n't come here just to give me money and patch up our quarrel , even if maybe you think that 's the reason you come yourself . " " Maureen , now ! " he cautioned her . " Maureen yourself , " she taunted . " You came here about somebody else . You can take your damned money and put it you know where . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Patiently he picked up the money and deposited it back on the table . " Amos is more of a man than you are . " She choked back her rage . " He went with inc to the abortion doctor at any rate . "  |p105Daniel  raised his head , astonished . " Oh , a surprise , huh ? " she said . " Well , the surprise was mine when I found out about you and him , let me tell you . Knock me up , and go off with a boy . " When she did not offer to say more , he made a motion to go toward the door . " You sit down and hear me out until I 'm good and ready to let you go , " Maureen gave out her order . " I do n't want to stay and hear a lot of shit you picked up at Ace Chisholm 's , " he protested half-heartedly . She went over to the money again , and crumpled some of the bills in her fist . " Mr. Masterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw away good money , " Daniel countered . Immediately he could have bitten his tongue for havingsaid it . " I think you know where Masterson is generous right now , " Maureen lashed back at him . " Poor Amos , " Daniel shook his head . " Yes , poor Amos , " Maureen cried . " He might have known you 'd run out on him , like you did on me . . . You run out on everybody , and you 'll never stop running while you 've got feet to put to the pavement . " " Sometimes you spare people by running , " he defended himself dispiritedly . " Sometimes you spare yourself more too , " she snapped . " Well , Maureen , "  --  he looked down at the puddle of melted slush which had come from his shoes  --  " let me say goodbye then . " She had taken up a glass as they talked , which happened to be filled merely with water , and she came toward him now with it . " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thoughtp106maybe some of the money in the envelope I give to you , well , maybe you could persuade Amos to take a bit of it . I did n't know he went with you that day . . . You do n't need to mention who give it . . . Maybe he wo n't have to stay with Masterson after all . . . " " If you want to save your little friend from Mr. Mastersonso bad , why are n't you man enough to give him the money yourself , and save him yourself . You love him , do n't you ? " she cried , beside herself . Without warning she threw the contents of the glass in his face . He did not flinch , and there was not a word from him . " Answer my question , God damn you , or I 'll never lift a finger to help you or Amos , if you 're both dying in the streets . " She came now to within an inch of his eyes . " I ca n't explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from her . " All I know is I have it . " " What ? " she screamed , relentless . " You know , " he coughed , helpless . " I love him . I love Amos . " She threw a ragged hand-towel at him then , and he just managed to catch it . " Wipe yourself dry , " she urged . " It 's the same towel you used to wipe your come off with here . Been laundered since , of course . " He held the towel for some time before his face without touching it to him , then swiftly pressed it against his flesh . She wheeled away from him . " All I 've been treated to for the last six months is stories about guys in love with guys . Christ , the age of anybody being in love with girls must be over ! We 're as useless as warts on a frog . " The water from her glass still glistened on his face likep107tears , as she looked up at him again , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed sorrow dry as stone . " Oh , I 'll do what I can for your little friend , " she spoke after a bit . " But I 'll do it for his sake , not yours . . . You 'd best to leave now , Daniel . Somebody 's coming to see me in a few minutes . " She looked quickly toward her bed . He did n't budge and she did not press him . " Why ca n't you tell Amos , though , before you go what you just now told me ? " Her anger came up again briefly . " Why ca n't you , Daniel ? " she asked , relenting a bit . " Why do n't you ask God ? " he shot at her , turned , and opened the door . She could n't forget the look on his face . It was not , she realized , Daniel 's face any more . It was not the face of any man she had ever seen . " You 're really off for the Army then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call after him . " In a few hours . " He spoke with his back to her , then disappeared down the stairwell.  |p111Standing  motionless for some time before this sign attached to a lamp post , Eustace exclaimed . " So then the birds are flown ! " Nonetheless he had hurried to the alley and up the back staircase in some faint hope of finding the landlord if not the tenant , but he arrived only in time for the perfunctory conclusion of the auction itself : the few people in attend-ance were already leaving with the sticks , boards , and ves-sels which passed for furniture , a water pitcher , a broken bookcase , or a small mirror under somebody 's arm  --  articles which a later epoch would hardly deem worthy of the dump-heap . But in a far corner , Eustace caught sight of paper old letters , ledgers and it was paper , as he had once joke Amos , that he was really queer for . The auctioneer , about to follow the congregation down the staircase , observed the poet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincing himself that the would-be purchaser was as im/pecunious as he appeared , sold him all the " trash " for twenty-five cents , which Eustace counted out into the fellow'smittened hand in uneven change , mostly pennies . Only when Ace had the bundle of papers in his own room did he realize the magnitude of his luck ( and his loss ) . He found himself in possession not only of Cousin Ida 's letters , but Amos 's scrawled notes to himself on his Greek lessons . But the find of finds was a diary of Daniel Haws scribbled in an old record-book of rents due and problemsin trigonometry . Among the pile he also found a recent letter , yet unopened , from Cousin Ida to Amos . But with his joy over treasure came the realization that the two men to whom the papers belonged were gone , probably forever . To Eustace it seemed unlikely he would ever set eyes on either of them again . About a week after the auction , Carla brought Eustace a red-white-and-blue envelope with an Army A. P. O. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information with in the armed forces ? " " Jesus , he 's done it , " Ace cried , after glancing through a sheaf of ruled letter paper extricated from the envelope . " It 's our landlord-hero , Daniel Haws . " Some people confess in the flesh , others on paper . Daniel , a mumbler or a mute in company , could pour himself out on a blank sheet of paper in a P. X. waiting - room to an invisible correspondent . His choice of Ace as a correspondent came about soon after he was inducted into the Army . Daniel went first through Camp Grant , thence to the baked plains of Scott Field , and finally to Biloxi , Mississippi where , one grim Sunday morning , seated at a table in the P. X. , he heard the voice of a chaplain addressing him.  | " Attending chapel today , soldier ? " When Daniel claimed no church , the chaplain went on , " Then , son , do the next best thing and write home . " " Nobody left to home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked with Captain Stadger , I suppose . " The chaplan studied Daniel 's face carefully . Daniel paused over the name , and his eyes blinked . " That 's all right , " the chaplain cleared his throat . " You look like a capable young fellow and probably ought to go into special training school . . . I 'll let the captain know about you . But write to somebody , today . " He pointed to letter-paper and enveolpes laid out on the stand beside them . When the chaplain had departed , Daniel looked about the room , saw that four or five other soldiers were busy with letter-writing . A sign often seen in flophouses and other lodgings of desperation was hanging on the wall : HAVE YOU WRITTEN HOMETO HER TODAY ? Starting suddenly , as if he were just hearing the name Captain Stadger minutes after the chaplain had pronounced it to him , Daniel gave a short low cry and laid his head down against the writing arm of the chair . Unable to call to mind what disturbed him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew something which he could not define , and it had cried out just now with his voice . What Daniel Haws could not tell himself , because he did not remember , was that on the very first night of his arrival in camp , he had sleepwalked into the tent of Captainp114Stadger . The officer , still awake at 2:30 A.M. and swatting from time to time at a moth which flew about his only illumination , a flashlight , was occupied in rubbing salve into a ringworm on his arm . He looked up with unbelief and yet with an expression of recognition and fulfilled hope at the sight of the soldier standing stark naked with sightless eyes before him . Rising , pointing his flashlight away from the soldier 's face and over his body , the captain studied and waited . Then sensing what he had on his hands , he quickly looked at the serial number on the sleepwalker 's dog-tag and in a hollow voice of command , in strict military etiquette , dismissed his caller with the implication that it had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summon him again . Obedient , Daniel saluted and , with still unseeing eyes , pivoted and with steady bearing marched back to his cot . Shaken by something half-remembered and by the name of his captain , and unwelcome as the very sound Eustace Chisholm was to him , nonetheless Daniel 's fingers , pressed white against the leadpencil , began to move over the letterpaperas he wrote a message to Chicago : " Why , Ace , you will ask , " Daniel Haws wrote , " am I sending this letter to you . Well , that is a question I might better put to myself . I have lost all shame . Spreading the cheeks of my ass for every little graduate and lieutenant from West Point to look up , milking my cock in short-arm inspection , cleaning garbage cans , having my arms and thighs shot full of cow-pox and typhoid , I am a public mop-handle , they have all of me , and are planning to sever anything they can not freely manipulate . Since I have lost all shame here in Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youp115blab everything the minute you hear it , for though you are people say brilliant , you are the lowest species of human being ever crawled over earth , and you will admit this , for if there is one thing in you that distinguishes you from slime it is you are honest , this makes you I imagine , a man . I admirethe trait and you are the one I can write to as a consequence . You are a chancre and you admit it . I do not know what I am , the only thing I know is I signed back to hell , can you figure it out , nobody here can  --  I was in this hell once and came back of my own free will to reenlist at the advancedage of 25 , but as I said I have no shame and will admit to you on paper , which you can show then to all your cackling ball-less friends that what I have I have bad , the fever of Amos , I mean . I ran away thinking I would get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like naphtha . I have broken the rules here and gone out of bounds nightly to the nigger whorehouse and every black whore I have been with only brought out the fire of Amos and burned me to the root of my insides with it . I am in love with him and can only admit it to a hyena like you . If there was God for me , I would be on my knees all day , all night , I would have entered a religious order , but there is no-nothing for me but Amos , and now the army  --  I need it , and the army I can see sees I need it . I am under , I understand , a Captain Stadger , who is death in circles , and I hear from beforehand he will exercise all the authority he has over me , well , let him , let him put me on the wheel if he has to and twist until I recognizethe authority of the army so good there will be nothing but it over me , over and above Amos and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I earn only twenty bucks a month but am willing to give it all to you for word from that curly-haired master of me . I will even beg , borrow andp116steal to give you more , if you will only write me about him . Ace , I 'm on my knees in front of you . DANIEL HAWS , HeadquartersSquad , Biloxi , Miss . " Stunned perhaps as much by his unexpected luck as at the prospect of receiving more letters , Ace wrote back : " I am as surprised to get a letter from you as to hear a tombstone speak . I do n't want your army money . I want more letters . I never knew there was so much inside of you . God , Daniel , it 's glorious . If you can still be in love from an army tent , I can do the impossible and be a poet in Chicago . And you 're in love with somebody that is both impossible himself and hoplessly in love with you .. . " You ask for news of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give it to you but it 's bound to be all bad . Your Amos has sold his ass to a millionaire , but you know he did try to find work , he tried , but everything was stacked against him and so , to repeat , he has sold his ass to the rich . That 's all the news I have from that quarter , but I 'll go out and hunt for more if necessary in order to have your letters . I 'll even blackmailto keep you in information . Amos is well taken care of , probably for the first time in his life , so you do n't need to worry . Whether he will go on loving you or not , who knows . I hope he does n't . You two could have been happy together until Armageddon , which is probably not far off , but you are a proud man and can evidently only declare yourself over the distance of our South . Maybe they will lynch you down there for your pride . Goodby and for God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full month after Amos Ratcliffe left Maureen 's studioparty that he finally made a collect long-distance phone call to the Masterson country house , Sampford Court . When Reuben answered , Amos asked him if he would drive to the bus station and meet him . Reuben , petulant and offended because he had not heard from Amos in all this time , at first snapped at him on the phone and then made it clear he would drive in at once . The combination of Reuben 's bad temper and immediateconsent to meet him reassured Amos that the millionairemeant what he had said at Maureen 's . " Where the heck did you disappear to ? " Reuben began at once when he faced Amos in the waiting-room of the bus depot . " And look at your new suit , will you , all out of press and mussed . " Amos hardly spoke in return . He was busy shelling and munching roasted peanuts , which he profferred to Reuben who testily refused them . " Do n't suppose you 've had a decent meal in days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You promised me , Amos , " Reuben began , stuttering slightly , " you 'd call on me any time I was needed . What took you so long ? " Suddenly he took hold of Amos 's hand . " Watch out what you do , Mr. Masterson , or I 'll be picked up . Cops always on the lookout for dangerous degenerateslike me . " " Oh be still , " Reuben scoffed , missing Amos 's sarcasm.  | " What policeman would dare touch you when you 're in my company ? " " Thanks for the lesson in class structure , Mr. Masterson , " Amos said . " All right , Reuben then , " he corrected himself at the latter 's irritable protest . " I could n't very well have showed myself in my new clothes to old Daniel , or he would have beat the tar out of me . .. " At an eloquent look from Reuben , Amos stopped for a moment . " No , Reuben , I 'll tell you straight : after Maureen'sparty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new clothes or no . I could n't return to go on seeing someone I loved with my whole guts , and knew he would never let himself love me back . . . He really sent me to you that night at Maureen 's . . . At the last , I hear he maybe changed his mind and decided at least to say goodbye to me . He came over to Maureen 's  --  before he went to join the army , but we did n't connect . . . He went into service , I figure , to save himself the trouble of committing suicide ... " Reuben waited , silent , as if expecting more , then when it did n't come , said : " When you disappeared those days , we all thought maybe you 'd followed after Daniel . " Amos could not control the angry tears which rolled now down his cheeks , and which he quickly brushed off with his hands . Reuben stealthily handed him a handkerchief , and Amos dried his face carefully with it and , at Masterson 's silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept it . " You sure you did n't pay Daniel then to go off to the army , Reuben ? " Amos made a stab at a joke , but his hurt suddenly returned in full force and he turned quickly away . " Oh , Amos , I 'm as sorry as I can be to see you causedp119such pain . . . I know how much you cared for him . I do n't know how he could run off and leave someone like you , frankly . . . . I 'd have stayed for ever there just to be near you . " Amos returned slightly the pressure of Reuben 's hand now . " But , Amos , you must have known he was going back to the army ! " Reuben cried suddenly . " Was your love affair then over , may I ask ? " " What love affair , Reuben ? " Amos asked ferociously . Unaccustomed to such strong feeling , it was Reuben 's turn to look away . " Do n't tell me , Amos , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthy pause . " I do n't ever want to pry . I have only one mission so far as you are concerned , to help you and to love you . " " I never had any love affair with Daniel flaws , " Amos said with maniacal bitterness . In a second-class hotel on La Salle Street , Amos allowed Reuben any and every liberty and intimacy . Indeed Reuben was surprised at the boy 's sexual inexperience , for though Masterson himself had fewer sexual encounters than he boasted and most of these with the female sex , he suddenly felt deeply initiated and masculine before Amos , and his passion was increased by this fact . It was difficult for him to take in that Daniel and Amos 's life together had been only " sleepwalking . " Amos himself tried to explain , but at last gave up , admitting that he himself did not understand it . After the first abatement of physical desire , Reuben lay back peacefully against Amos 's body . He talked at suchp120length about Daniel Haws that Amos , nonplussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You sound more taken with him than you are with me . " " Daniel was n't my type at all , " Reuben pooh-poohed , " too masculine . But he was certainly the deeper of you two . " He spoke hastily , then apologized for this remark when he saw it had stung Amos 's pride . " Oh you 're more of everything , Amos , " he said . " All I meant by deeper ' is that Daniel loved you more than either of us understand , else how explain the sleepwalking , and well , he gave you up to me through love , that 's clear . " " Oh for Jesus Christ 's sake , let up , Reuben ! " " Tell me where you 've been all these past weeks , " Reubenasked , bending over his conquest now , moistening the youth 's curls with his mouth . He looked down at Amos 's wreath of pubic hair which at that moment , catching the light , resembled an aureole . Leaning over , he kissed him again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I was to tell you , " Amos lay back languid under the cascade of Reuben 's caresses . " Fact is that 's the trouble with my life . When I tell people about it they think I 'm lying . My life is odder than any pack of lies a maniac could give out . " " Supposing then you tell me the unbelievable truth . " " I went to the district , as Eustace still calls the colored part of town , " Amos began . " See , some months ago , Ace was very keen on the occult and he even got Daniel to go over there with him to Luwana Edwards ' . She 's a spiritualistand fortune-teller . Has her own church now . She was awful taken with Ace , but shied away from Daniel for some reason . She told Ace he had second-sight . I wandered around after Maureen 's party , into ' Washington Park , and then I thought of Luwana Edwards . After all I had to spendp121the night somewhere . But she told me too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my situation and she also wanted me to know she did n't forecast the future any more for anybody . . . " " And after Luwana 's where did you go ? " Reuben asked bitterly . " After Luwana 's ? " Amos laughed . Then turning moody , he continued , " You know Luwana said something funny just before I left her place . She said she was aiming to pass her gift on to a friend . I think she meant Ace . " " You like colored people , do n't you ? " Reuben mumbled , abstractedly . " I can see how sick you are over Daniel 's leaving , Amos , " he went on . " It was wrong of me to make love to you , I guess , but I could n't stop myself . " He began coveringAmos 's body with hungry embraces . " Suddenly the unobtainableis ours , " he said , and his eyes filled . " Do you think you can ever be serious about me , Rat ? " He used the nickname @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , way over and above the physical . I 'm head over heels . " Amos seemed a thousand miles away . " You 'll get over Daniel , " Reuben went on doggedly . " After all , he ran out on you . Tell me you 'll try to get over him ! Listen to me , Amos , I want you to come out and live at my house . Mother 's house , that is , but it 's mine , too , after all . " " After all . " Amos smiled and touched Reuben 's hand gently . " Well , when do you want me to come ? " he said wryly . Reuben balked at the question , and walked about the room , dejectedly . Amos studied the body of the man who had just showered him with so much feeling . Despite his growing corpulence , Reuben was not unattractive , and in fact the scars on his chest and legs , from his war service ,  |p122somehow  added to his good looks , but whatever he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get Mother ready for your visit , " Mastersonwas saying . " I 've told her as much as I can for the presentabout you and me . " " You mean you 're trying to get me ready for her , Reuben , " Amos spoke up , rubbing himself with a hand-towel . " Well , I 'll never be ready . I do n't belong anywhere . Ca n't even make it with niggers , Reuben . I 'm just real enough for a sleepwalker to love , I guess . That 's all Daniel could ever do too , so we were two of a kind . Sleepwalk to my bed and look at me like I was the new moon . " " So Ace told me . " Reuben hung his head , ashamed perhaps he had discussed the matter with the poet . " Amos , what does it matter if Mother does n't understand . Come anyhow . She 'll accept you or she can lump it . " " I fell in love with my mother before I knew who she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother and I had an affair not too dissimilar from what we 've been doing now . " " Oh for the Lord 's sake , " Reuben turned away from him . " Do n't make a horrible joke of such things . " " You said I was honest and told the truth . " Amos turned away from him also . " While you were off with your colored people , I was slumming too . " Reuben went back to the remark he had let slip earlier . " I spent a few minutes of time again with Ace Chisholm . What a fantastic character ! " Amos grimaced at Reuben 's choice of words . " He ca n't have been a good influence on you , Amos . " " Look , Reuben . You 've got to get a few things straight for once and all . . . I do n't have the luxury of choosing who is a good influence . I 'm adrift in the sea , so I have to grasp whatever I can get hold of . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but somebody like Ace ? He admits he 's a monster , at any rate . " Amos 's eyes lingered now on the scars of Reuben 's body . " Do my war injuries disgust you ? " Reuben inquired , somewhat piteously , but there was an undertone of anger , along with the hurt of rejection he had been suffering all night at the hands of Amos . " They 're the realest thing about you , Reuben . They make up for your fat tummy . " The older man blushed , then managed to get out , " Well , I 'm glad you like something about me at least . Oh , I did n't earn my scars any more than I do my money . They came to me easy and got cured easy . I have Purple Hearts and the rest in my bureau drawer , but I 'll be as honest as you are . I 'm no hero , and if I were , you could make me feel I was n't . I just love you , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in goblets . . . Unfortunately the feeling is n't reciprocal . You do n't care for me at all , Amos . " " Yes , I do , Reuben . You 're a good friend . " " If you could only love me a little bit as you loved him . " " Love Daniel ! I 'd like to kill Daniel . I 'd like to barbecue his balls while the bugger is tied live to the stake . That 's what I 'd like . I could cut the bastard to ribbons . " " You love him , that 's all you 're saying . What I want to try to explain now is Mother . She 's really my Grandmother . My mother and father both died when I was an infant . My wife died about two years ago  --  she 'd been ill for so long , and my Grandmother  --  my Mother as I call her  --  has been nagging me to re-marry . I wo n't minimize the problem , Amos . " " I bet I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You 've got to come with me , Amos . I ca n't live withoutp124you , now there 's been this between us . I do n't know what it is that 's happened . I do n't know what you are . But you 're everything for me . Have been ever since I set eyes on you at Daniel 's that evening . . . And I could understand even then how somebody like Daniel , who is n't even queer , going off his rocker over you . " Amos covered his eyes . " Amos , " Reuben went on , scarcely conscious of what he said or indeed where he was , " you 're larger than life . You came from a crossroads , Ace told me . He 's wrong . You came straight from the hand of Creation . . . Let me tell you again  --  I could drink you in goblets . " He let his head fall over Amos 's sex . " Yeah , you got the love bug for sure , Reuben . " Amos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses , a dazed lack of concentration in his eyes . " You 've got to come and live with me , " Reuben now cried out . " Hang Mother . I 'll die without this now . Tell me , Amos , you 'll come . " Once he had calmed himself again , lighting a cigarette , Reuben inquired : " Do you know what Ace Chisholm advisedme to do ? " " Cut my balls off , I suppose . " " He advised that if I could n't make it with you , I should marry Maureen . " Amos scarcely seemed surprised , and this disappointed Reuben . " You do n't care what I do , do you , Amos ? " " Well , what do you want out of me , Reuben , outside of teaching me how to tremble in front of your matriarch ? " " I told you I wanted you . " " ' Fraid you ca n't marry me , Reuben . And I do n't thinkp125your Mother-Grandmother would find me a fetching bride . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . " " I 'll come , Reuben , I said I 'd come . It 's you keeps warningme I ca n't come maybe . " " And you 'll stay with me always , promise ? " Reuben held the boy to him so tightly it pained . " I 'll stay as long as it lasts , " Amos told him . Walking around the room now , Reuben gave off a kind of soliloquy . " Ace Chisholm ca n't speak without wounding one 's sensibilities . He talks to me as if I were nobody , an idiot . My name and position mean nothing to him . In a way I like that . He 's sincere that way . Have you heard the names he gives President Roosevelt ? I never heard anybody called such names , not even by my black Republican relatives . He calls you a whore and worse , of course . Do you know what he said to Maureen , who laughed over it ? He told her , Marry your queer millionaire . You 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men 's stables . You 'll be the wife of the queen , about as important as an eunuch in a harem . You 'll be the fifth leg on a fine old chair . You 'll turn to adultery and your millionaire faggot wo n't care , and he 'll end up taking your conquests to bed with him . . . ' Yet he told Maureen it 's the only marriage that is thinkable for her . " " Holy gee , you memorized it , Reuben ! " " Amos , Amos , come with me tonight . Do you hear ? " The boy nodded , and waited for the feel of Reuben 's mouth on his flesh.  |p126During  the years Reuben had lived with his grandmother as a nonpaying guest in the thirty-room country American mansion overlooking Lake Michigan , safely isolated in the suburbs ( he had moved in at her plea that the depression had more than halved their income , they must save on expenses , and furthermore she needed a man about the house ) , the old lady had chafed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heir . He , on the other hand , counted this period of time as his most carefree , almost his happiest , because his wife Letty 's illness while enabling him to take advantage of the safe respectablity of being married and earning him the sympathy of all who knew him , permittedhim at the same time to indulge in all the pleasures forbidden his married friends , without risk of outright criticism , especially his friendship with handsome young men . While young Mrs. Masterson had lingered on , the old lady 's constant cry was , " Why ca n't Letty go ? Have n't we doctored enough ! " and after her funeral , before she was hardly cold in the ground , she began with her new nagging , " When , Reuben , for God 's sake will you marry and produce a grandson for me ! " Amos 's coming therefore could only be regarded by her as a senseless and irritating postponement of her hopes and plans and a kind of deliberate dereliction of duty on Reuben'spart . The senior Mrs. Masterson 's influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , began to be aware of its full extent . Obsessed as she had always been by money andp127social position , she drilled into her grandson from his babyhoodthat he had a " name , " that he belonged to a " front family , " and that he would have to live up to it . It was name more than character that counted , and character , he deduced from her teaching , itself was subsumed under name , and from this idea he was never able to escape . " So then we are to be made happy by the arrival of your young friend  --  what did you say his name was ? " Mrs. Mastersonsuddenly opened the door on the crisis itself , with no attempt to disguise her loftiness and bitter lack of compliance . " A good Saxon surname , " she nodded on hearing Reuben repeat Amos Ratcliffe . Having once been a poor girl herself before her marriage , the elder Mrs. Masterson not only detested poverty in others , but feared and distrusted the poor . Of course she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used her own line of reasoning , that those with name and position should help those who had neither . " The poor , my dear grandson , " she never tired of pointing out , " are hardly ever worth the powder to blow them up with . But we ca n't allow them to stand milling about and breaking the plate-glass , can we ? " In this one respect she agreed with the otherwise " deplorable " Roosevelts : crumbs can and shall keep back the ranks of the paupers . One evening in March the meeting between the two importantpeople in Reuben 's life took place . As Amos came through the interminably long hall , accompanied by Reuben , on their way to the dining-room ( Reuben had arrived as usual late ) , Mrs. Masterson , from her position at head of the table , was able to observe the boy approach . His undeniablegood looks struck her immediately , but what held her eye even more was an undeniable something else , farp128beyond the " marks of poverty " which she expected in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishment that the boy advancing to meet her wore a look of expectation of unnamable horror . She felt an irresistible wish to touch , even to pet the young man , and at the same time an overmastering urge to order him from the house . Yet had there been no Reuben at that moment  --  such was the strange confused tumult of feeling which came over her  --  she would have certainly made him her heir . Somewhat aghast at this unprecedented rush of impressions and feelings , Mrs. Masterson came to herself only when she heard Reuben 's voice , impatient at having had to repeat himself several times ( he mistook her failure to reply as due to her deafness ) . " Well , you 're late , even for you , my dear Reuben , " the grandmother cried in her deep voice , starting from her own reverie . She permitted Reuben to kiss her on her cheek , and then , unaccountably , took Amos 's hand before her grandson'sown introduction , " Mother , this is young Mr. Ratcliffeabout whom I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she replied , not having taken her eyes off the boy , " I can see that as usual you 've told me nothing at all . " " I suppose he is to be my albatross , " Mrs. Masterson told Reuben , to his considerable astonishment , the morning after Amos 's arrival at Sampford Court . Reuben , who was waiting for the " long talk about everything " she had insisted on , jumped slightly on her choice of metaphor . " For one thing , " she went on at his look of surprise , your Amos is capable of winning hearts . . . But there is n't time for him in my heart or yours , Reuben . Time 's runp129out for both of us . . . We ca n't devote ourselves to charm and beauty . When they go or our hearts change , what do we have in their place ? " She seemed to be speaking suddenly to herself . Snatching some papers from her desk , she then discussed certain matters of business , a bad investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and then without warning she flew at the target again by shouting in the manner of a deaf person : " What in strictest fact do you know of him ? Who were his parents , why is he through school at such an early age , and why should you be attracted to one so young , so entirely out of your circle , our circle , our way of life .. Are you so desperate for companionship ? " she could not keep down the note of alarm . " And why do you not contemplate , at least , marriage ? I 'm waiting for answers , Reu-ben ! " " As usual , " Reuben sat down at the furthest end of the room , " you 've asked me enough questions for us to be in conference for a month of Sundays . " " I have the time for it , if you do . " She put down a heavy gold bracelet , which had come loose as she had waved her arm at him . She folded her ancient veined hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a middle finger shone fitfully in the morning light . " Of course , " she continued , " he is a charming boy , a personableboy . Good manners too . And I gather from the faces of the other guests he must have said some acceptable things while at table . . . He was sober too , while you were in your usual evening condition . " But , " she cried , interrupting him before he had time to utter a syllable in defense , " you can hardly have decided to fit your life around that of a boy with mere good looks who passes for clever at his studies . "  | " Let 's say then I have , Mother . " " It 's quite early in the morning for jokes . " " I am in dead earnest . " Reuben rose and turned his back on her for a moment . The old lady sensed a new kind of strength in Reuben  --  this was not like his usual self . " I had intended to take up the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely with the problem of Mr. Ratcliffe ! " " Mother , I 'm crowding forty years of age , and I shall drink if I choose . . . . As to Amos , well , if you would preferme to leave your home , I 'm prepared to do so . " He took the plunge . " But you said some years back , if you 'll recall , that you needed me at Sampford Court . Very well , I 'm willingto stay with you and be needed , if I may fetch out Amos here to be needed by me ! " " So we 're to strike a bargain on that , are we ? " she smiled . Something of her old small-town New England humor , Reuben supposed , came out then , but he was too out of sorts to be charmed or amused by it . " What you 're saying in effect then is that all you care for is your own happiness , if one can call a prolonged infatuationhappiness , and to blue hell with your responsibility to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst of ire . " Mother , I do n't want to remarry , if that 's the subject you 're trying to force to discussion . And that 's final . Besides , I do n't care for women ! " " You told me you were very happy with Letty before she became an invalid . " " Oh that 's all so long ago it seems it happened to another man . . . . I 'm happier with Amos . " " Amos , whatever he is , is not a woman . " " That 's why I like him . "  | " Yes , of course ! " she cried , despair getting the better of her wrath . She tapped with her husband 's riding whip , which she now employed to press the button for calling the servants . " Very well , Reuben . But why ca n't you hire him then as your valet or paid companion , instead of wining and dining him about town as if he was fresh down from Olympus , and drawing all eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty penny . " " As a matter of fact , Amos costs me less in a month than some of the tiresome Social Register women of your choice do in an hour . " " Certainly , Reuben , you know me better than to think I 'd approve of a mere rich woman for your life . . . I 'd approveof a girl of good family without a cent to her name , if she came along , and you know it . I even like that young person who paints , Miss O'Dell . " Here , unaccountably , Mrs. Masterson laughed heartily . " Well , why do n't you bring Miss O'Dell to keep you company here , then , " Reuben said , going along with her mood , " and allow me to keep Amos ? " " I 'm too old to hear nonsense about great matters , and since you 've brought up the matter of your age , so are you . " " I 'm not going to give up Amos , for the simple reason I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she gave him such a terrible glance he sat down again . " He 's a substitute then for a son , which you 've never had ! " she thundered . " That 's just what he is not ! " Reuben roared back at her . " Then I do n't understand . " Mrs. Masterson now stood up , sniffed her camphor bottle , settled her shawl more loosely about her neck , and stiffly changed chairs . " Well , dear Mother , I do n't intend to talk till under/standing dawns on you : I value time nearly as much as you do , after all . But you 've never tried to understand me . If you think I 'm going to marry to follow your wishes , you 're vastly mistaken . The world has been coming alive for me again , and if necessary I can get on without any money from you . If you prefer your Presbyterian circle and wish me out of the house , say so . It 's you who 've worried about the depression and expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so I moved in long ago , but if you 've changed your tune and you do n't dread any longer all the things that bothered you before I came down here , say so , and I 'll depart . " Mrs. Masterson , to his considerable astonishment , broke down . The hand with the flashing stone covered her eyes , and she emitted heavy groans , the first emotion of such kind Reuben had ever seen her betray . It was the beginning of her fall . He did not try to comfort her . " Well , Mother , " he said severely when she had dried her tears . " Reuben , " she tried to regain her voice and composure , " if you need him that much , then of course you must do as you feel you must . As to leaving Sampford Court , that is out of the question . You sha n't go a step . Of course I need you and of course you must stay . . . But , " she was almost herself again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not occur . You have no money except in stocks that pay now poor , if any , dividends . It is I who control our fortune and will until I go , and you owe it to yourself and all of us , to the country , to stay here and keep down expenses . We 're on the verge of some cataclysm , and we must stay together until the emergency is over . Thank God , you are too old to go to war this time , my dear boy . " Mrs. Masterson , an avid reader of history , was then off onp133a discourse on the causes and consequences of the last " Great War " when Reuben , in a manner not usual with him , unceremoniously interrupted her : " You 've hinted about , Mother , that you 'd like somewhat more information about Amos 's background than you 've felt I cared to give you . Actually I know next to nothing , but you 'd best be informed he is an illegitimate child . " He stopped speaking then not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suddenly the full weight of Amos 's confessionconcerning his own mother , came to him now in all its blinding meaning for the first time , and struck him into silence . Mrs. Masterson sat gazing at him , calm and unmoved , when he came out of his reflections . " Amos calls his mother only Cousin Ida , " Reuben stammered , blushing . " You may rest assured , " he heard his grandmother 's voice , " that if you think I am going to conduct an inquisitionon the poor boy , you show very little insight into , or appreciation of , my character or methods . I 'm surprised at you , Reuben . I bid you good morning ... " Reuben stood indecisive before her , but made no movementtoward the door . She had already turned away from him to the papers on her desk , but looking up from her work after a bit , almost accidentally , and finding him still in her presence , she found it impossible not to add : " My heart aches for you , Reuben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . " The tears came to his eyes , and humiliatingly enough for him , she saw them , but there was now neither a look of reproach nor pity in her expression , and she accepted the kiss he bestowed on her cheek by pressing his hand briefly.  | " What , may I ask , are you reading this time at table ? " Mrs. Masterson addressed Amos one chilly April evening when the two of them had sat down together again , without other company , at dinner . Amos handed her the Greek text of Xenophon 's Banquet and allowed the old lady to satisfy her curiosity by leafing through a few of the pages . Quickly returning the book , she explained that she could now only stumble through her Greek , and shot a glance of troubled admiration at the boy . She had noted steady changes in him since his arrival , not so much owing to his now sizeable wardrobe , whose costlinessmade her wince , as perhaps because of his new regimen , daily baths , regular meals and uninterrupted slumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now recognize her son . They owed their present strange communion with each other to a change no less startling in her grandson 's habits . Shortly after Amos 's coming , as if relieved by the unexpectedfulfilment of his hopes , Reuben had begun absentinghimself every few days , often staying overnight in town on one pretext or another . Left thus alone , Amos and Mrs. Masterson found it difficult , if not impossible , sometimes to hit on topics for conversation which would carry them through the meal . She quizzed him on his upbringing in Southern Illinois , for this topic genuinely interested her , but Amos 's pained reticence prevented her from going into it deeply , and finally , in resignation , she had allowed him to bring his book to the dining-room and even read as shep135talked interminably in his direction , while the servants whispered . As for Reuben , once he felt reasonably certain Amos would not " run out " on him  --  after all Sampford Court was some 40 miles from Chicago  --  his absences became more frequent and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city to do . As Amos pointed out in a bitter letter to Eustace , " I 've become the child Reuben Masterson had to give birth to , and it 's no surprise therefore he 's deposited me with his Grandmother , while the heir and father goes scot-free to worship Bacchus . " Many a cold spring evening , and spring was very cold that year , the old lady and the transformed Amos sat together through dinner and the interminable evening , guarded and attended by the formidable staff of servants , fed like royal prisoners and bored to death by each other 's company . Mrs. Masterson went to bed around nine and lay the rest of the night in a kind of wrestling match with Morpheus , never really falling sound sleep until three or four in the morning , that is if she heard Reuben 's footsteps returning from another of his evenings out . The day after looking at Amos 's Greek book Mrs. Mastersonhad sent her butler to a bookstore in town , to procure a complete English translation of Xenophon 's Banquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universityGreek faculty , to locate one . She wondered whether her reading of the dialogue helped her to grasp , at least partially , the goings-on that then occurred in her house . Galled by Reuben 's neglect and wearied with the interminablylong evenings , Amos had a diabolical inspiration . He remembered the Swedish gardener , whose principal task was to keep the rooms of the great house supplied with flowers from his nursery . Recently a widower , he lived alonep136in servants quarters a short distance down the ravine , and his appearance was striking enough that Amos felt he would have graced a banquet at which Socrates was a guest more becomingly than aristocratic Reuben himself . In the middle of the night , disturbing Mrs. Masterson , who took the boy 's exiting steps for those of her grandson'sreturn from carousing , Amos , an Indian bathrobe thrown over his pure silk scarlet pajamas , carefully adjustinghis usual nocturnal erection , walked confidently to the Swede 's cottage , whistling a little tune . At the door , he knocked loudly and waited , still whistling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knocking , and admitted his guest through sheer astonishment . Once inside , Amos had no intention of leaving again , for he had got chilled through and through from the raw air , and the sight of Bootes rising in the east had made his teeth chatter . When Reuben did not answer her imperious " Is that finally you ? " , Mrs. Masterson rose , threw a quilt about her shoulders , and opened the door of her grandson 's bedroom . Surprised at the absence of both Reuben and his favorite , and feeling now suddenly a bit light-headed , she sat down at Amos 's desk . Her eyes fell on a half-finished letter the boy had written to Cousin Ida ; under this letter lay a handful of others , opened , and thumbprinted by his reading , bearing an indecipherable Illinois postmark with the sender 's name , Ida Henstridge . Mrs. Masterson struggled with her conscienceonly briefly , then she read avidly not only Amos 's unfinished epistle , but with even more rapt attention all those Cousin Ida had written her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of warm air , brought her immediately back to long-forgotten thoughts and feelings and relationshipsbefore her marriage.  |p137She  read of Cousin Ida blaming herself , defending herself , and at last crying out against Amos 's unjust bitterness , and accusations against his " lot . " Cousin Ida begged him to have patience , trust , hope , to thank his benefactors , even though he could not stand the rich , as exemplified at any rate by Reuben and the " old lady of the castle . " She begged Amos to put up with the shows of wealth now as he had with poverty and going without and to remember he was a man and that meant he could be free . " I would give anything sometimes if I had been born a man , for then I would not have to sit here and wonder where my next dollar was coming from , but on the other hand , I would not be the mother of a fine son like you , and that makes up for all the rest , dearest Amos . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and she and Ida had told the tea leaves to see what lay in store for Amos , and then they had got down together on the rag rug in the kitchen and prayed that things would go betterfor him in the future . " But if they do n't , dear Amos , come home , remember the Welcome sign is always out . " There were other details , the canary had died , and she would n't get another , but would leave the cage in its old place ; Widow Martin down the alley had taken away her membership in the church because of her disliking the new preacher 's wife ; the refinery was being sued by the town for its failure to control the suffocating fumes and bad odors it let loose . " I am glad , " she concluded , " Mr. Masterson shows you such strong affection and interest , for there never is any word from your father , and I wonder , Amos , if maybe he is n't dead . " Having read all the letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreboding and sudden extreme giddiness . She desperately hoped Reuben might come in , forp138she felt too weak to call out for the servants . Then her eye fell on a slender sheaf of pages over which was scrawled " Visits from a Sleepwalker . " She read , uninterrruptedly absorbed , for an hour more . Still yawning in huge paroxysms , the Swedish gardner Sven studied his late caller . His command of English being negligible , and a man of few words in his own tongue , he took off his thick slippers , and curled up beside his selfinvitedvisitor . He recognized Amos as the guest of Mr. Masterson and in his bewildered way decided that owing to an influx of guests at the great house either the old lady or Master Reuben himself had sent the boy to ease the overflow . After the light was extinguished , he was soon put to a different view of matters at the floodgate of affection which Amos , stung by his having lost Daniel Haws and being shut up away from everything in the country , poured out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love by his wife 's death yielded too easily . After the first appeasement of feeling , the gardener was bold enough to ask why Amos 's feet were so hard and horny , for he could not help comparing them to his wife 's , whose toes had been like cotton when pressed against him . Amos explained that he was an inveterate walker from his earliest childhood in the country and had spent most of his time in Chicago on the streets , exploring every inch of the city afoot . At this the gardener , with a certain uneasy superstitiousdread in his voice , asked if the boy would show him his feet . Amos willingly obliged , and placed his toes on a white rug that lay by the bed . The gardener , who slept naked , cov/ered himself against the cold with Amos 's borrowed bathrobe , and studied the boy 's feet under a lamp . " Goat feet you have ! " he told Amos . " And the rest of you so handsome ! " The gardener looked up from his kneeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Amos chided . " The devil scolds where he 's to blame ! " Sven cried . Puzzledfrom the time he had opened the door on his caller , he shook his head now half-pleased , half-dismayed . " Does your master know you have such goat-like feet ? " Sven inquired . " I have no master but me , " Amos snapped . The Swede was walking into the next room when Amos cried with a kind of wistful alarm : " You 're not going off now like everybody else ? " " Oh no , no , " the gardener smiled , " you 'll see what I 'm about , and you 'll be glad . " Amos could hear him drawing water , and he returned with a heavy tray containing a silver wash basin , a bar of freshly opened soap , a thick brush , some cloths , and talcum powder . Without more ado , he plunged Amos 's feet into the basin , and began washing them vigorously . Moved by such ceremony , Rat mumbled appreciation and studied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and an open honesty of expression gave him appeal , and besides his biceps bulged like turkey eggs . " You have walked to the ends of the earth . " The gardener looked up from his task from time to time . " Only the devil has walked further . " During the bathing of his feet by Sven , Amos as was his habit whistled rather loudly , and this familiar whistle was heard now by Reuben Masterson , as reeling from his nightp140on the north side of Chicago , he started up the path to the big house . He stopped short in his tracks , inspecting his breath as it issued into the air . The whistle came again , this time unmistakenly from the gardener 's cottage . Wheeling about suddenly , grinning with anticipation of seeing Amos , and not suspecting anything out of the ordinary , Reuben knocked at the door of the cottage calling Amos by name . " Do n't answer , " Amos begged Sven . " But I must , " the gardener showed no sense of the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm warning you . " But Sven with his old-world respect for authority and proper behavior , was already on the way down , without havingremembered in his haste that he still had on the bathrobeAmos had worn rather than his own . " What are you doing with my robe on ? " Reuben stammeredon confronting the Swede in the doorway . " Your young friend is here , " the gardener replied . Having caught sight of Amos naked on the bed , Reuben picked up a rawhide whip from the wall and struck the gardenerwith it full in the face . Tasting blood which ran copiouslyinto his mouth , the Swede almost involuntarily knocked his employer 's son to the floor . Amos , in a rush of spontaneous enthusiasm , clapped his hands . " You applaud , you rotten little bugger , when it was I who took you off the streets and gave you your first decent living ! " Masterson turned his fury on the boy , scarcely noticingthat the gardener had bent over and lifted him up off the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insult like a man , not out of ingratitude for your incredible gener/osity to me . " Amos found himself speaking in the style of Xenophon as translated by himself . " Get out the both of you ! " Reuben cried , mopping the blood from his face with the handkerchief handed him by the Swede . " A fine plot you 've been hatching behind our back ! " " You wo n't dismiss me , sir , " Sven began to Amos 's incredibledisgust . " You ca n't turn me out , Mr. Masterson , for something I did not mean ! " Reuben smiled . " Maybe your young bedfellow here will intercede for you . " " Please , please , " the Swede looked from Amos to Reuben , imploring , and gave every evidence he was about to kneel there before them when Amos suddenly struck the gardener a vivid blow . " Where are your balls you were so proud of a few minutes ago ? " the boy bellowed , while Reuben turned suddenly hysterical and began to sob . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Swede turned to Amos bitterly . " If you 've walked the streets , I 've walked them more ! " " Get packed , and we 'll clear out . " Amos spoke with cool imperiousness . The gardener shrugged his shoulders in hopeless agreement . Then , removing the Masterson bathrobe , he laid it gently on the table . Reuben sat there too stupefied to say a thing , but looking up just then , whether brought to by the sight of the gardener stripped , or realizing that having fired an employe of whom Mrs. Masterson was so inordinately fond and proud would bring him trouble from that quarter , he suddenly stood up and asked Sven to forget everything he had said and to stay.  | " I 've been overhasty , Sven , " Reuben said , finding it very difficult to speak to a man standing stark naked in front of him . " Besides , " he finished , " I 've no right to dismiss you . That is Grandmother 's province . After all , I 'm hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , I 'll leave , sir . " The gardener turned away confused . But then pointing to Amos , he cried , " Why did he have to come here , sir , and put me to this test ! " Both men suddenly gave Amos the same indescribable look as if they had discovered at last the common source of their trouble and torment . " Is there a drop of spirits in the house ? " Reuben inquired , and in a way of conciliation he threw the bathrobe around the Swede 's shoulders . " I think , Sven , we could all stand with a stiff drink of something . " Sven brought out a bottle of brandy , a gift from Mrs. Masterson , who allowed liquor in the homes of her servants on the understanding it was to be used only in cases of illnessor exposure . It was , as Reuben found out hardly to his surprise when he tasted it , third-rate . When the gardener could not find glasses , Masterson , despite Sven 's bashful reluctance , insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amos declined to join them . He sat on an old buffalo rug in the center of the room , and glowered . After a while Sven , prompted by Reuben , ceased even to wipe the mouth of the bottle and the two men , becoming mellow , exchanged confidences . They railed at boys like Amos who preyed on widowers , and devoted a great deal of time to repeating pledges to one another never to tell " Lady " Masterson the events of this night . Reuben then assured Sven that he could stay at Sampford Court till hell froze over . He was in the midst of a long speech of effusive congratulations on the gardener 's physique , poise , and gentlemanly bearing , together with ap143panegyric on the glory of having Viking ancestry , when Amos rose in disgust and , throwing the ill-omened bathrobe over him , opened the door . There to his astonishment stood on the threshold old Mrs. Masterson , garbed only in her dressing-gown , her hair in long yellowish white braids falling over her shoulder . Her gaze went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stark naked Sven . Both men were in violent sexualexcitement . She turned her look of icy outrage and blame to Amos and her lips moved to say something to him , but a convulsion of some violent kind came over her , and she lurched forward to fall at the boy 's feet . Reuben rushed forward . " Mother , mother ! " his hysteria mounted . " Tell him to leave me , my only son ! " The old woman continued to fix her attention on Amos . Her jaw hung down from the effect of the stroke she had just suffered , and only her eyes , out of her entire countenance , kept their former expression . " Ca n't my death have some decorum ? " Reuben looked accusingly at Amos , as if it was the boy who had both drawn the grandmother to the cottage and who had been responsible for her fall , but Amos gave him back so fierce and eloquent a look that Reuben turned away . Sven , hastily clothed , now carried the old lady to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly only to open them wide on Amos , who glowered at her in rapt attentionfrom the shadow of the open door . " Has n't this chosen Satan of yours any shame ? " she cried . " Ca n't you pay him to leave , Reuben , if he wo n't departpeaceably ? Make my last moments decent , for God 's sweet sake , even though your own life is foul ! " " Please go , Rat , " Reuben entreated , deadly pale.  |p144Amos  wheeled about in the direction of the mansion . A few minutes later , carrying a small grip , he was on the main highway to Chicago . " Coming , coming ! " Carla Chisholm , exasperated , cried in response to the rain of peremptory blows on the door to the apartment . She put down the jar of night cream , and wiped off her chin and throat with a tissue . To her considerable astonishment , on lifting the safety lock , she found herself facing not Ace , whom she had been expecting for hours , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sampford Court ( she had scarcely set eyes on him before ) , she probably would not have been able to recognizeReuben Masterson in his present condition : he was bleeding from the nose , wore two great blue bruises over one eye , his collar and tie were torn ; only his tweed suit and benign expression hinted he might be " somebody . " He identified himself , and she stood aside , still speechless , to let him come in . Recovered from her initial shock , and thrilled to know who it was , she invited him to sit down and managed to make him feel more comfortable , more quickly , than any other woman he had ever met : she brought him a half dozen things from her medicine cabinet , and most soothing of all , a fifth of Weller bourbon , which he opened immediately . Between constant probing of his mouth to see if he had lost teeth , he summarized his news : Amos had run away and Mother Masterson despite the fact she had had ap145stroke , had given permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here to do . Next Reuben explained , with a bit more detail , the reasons for his own condition . He had driven into town in hopes of finding out Amos 's whereabouts from Eustace , had parked nearby , and within seconds after lockingthe door of the car had been set upon by " roughs " who had knocked him down , but had left without robbing him , scared off by his cries for help . During his perfunctory recital Reuben looked about the apartment anxiously as if searching for traces of Amos 's presence . " Amos is n't far off , " Carla reassured him . " He 's gone with my husband over to South Parkway to see some Negro spiritualist they have the habit of calling on every so often . " Reuben looked at her in a dazed manner and she wondered if he had heard her . " Mr. Masterson , why do n't you spend the night here now ? We 've an extra place as Clayton Harms has left us . " " Please call me Reuben , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll gladly wait forever . " He could not completely suppresshis tears . In wishing perhaps to divert him from weeping , she chose to discuss Clayton Harms at length . She helped herself , at the same time , at his invitation , from her own bottle of bourbon . " We 've been through an upheaval nearly as terrible as what you 've been through with Amos and your Grandmotherand the gardener . Perhaps as terrible , for us . " She considered the whole affair . " I do n't know whether you ever met Clayton Harms . " She explained quickly her own running away with another man , and Clayton 's moving in and taking over in her stead . Wiping his eyes with her tissue from his own grief , Reu/ben listened now more through stupefaction than interest . " Clayton asked Eustace to choose between us almost from the first day of my return . One day in a rage he threw four of five of his electric signs out of the window , nearly killing some people , and demanded a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then a few nights ago , we had this knock-down-drag-out fight . God , it was awful . Ace and he beat one another to a pulp , and Clayton turned on me with a bread knife just before the police got here . " She pointed to a few inconclusive scratches on her arm . " But Reuben dear , "  --  she shot a glance of sympathy at him  --  " here I am chatterboxing away when your grandmother is at the point of death ! Forgive me . " " I think Mother  --  I always call grandmother Mother , " Reuben came out of his reverie , dry-eyed now , " I think she plans to die in order to show me how much she disapproves of my present life and Amos . She has the will to do so . " " Are n't you exaggerating a bit because of your present depression ? " Carla was taken aback in spite of herself . " That 's just what I 'm not doing , dear lady , " he said huffily . " She 'll die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to me . " He rose and applied a menthol stick to his forehead . " Where , by the way , " his bad temper continued , " did you say Eustace took Amos this evening ? " " They went to Luwana Edwards , a Negro spiritualist . But in regard to your other remark I think , if you do n't mind my saying so , it 's all the other way around , Reuben . Amos took Eustace . I think Amos can lead him by the nose any time he takes the notion to ! " " Are Eustace and Amos that way with one another ? I mean lovers , " Reuben brought out rather quickly . " No , " Mrs. Chisholm sighed deeply , " they 're not loversp147at all . It might be better if they were for this way they both try to exert power over one another , and that 's what makes their relationship so dangerous . Each eggs the other on to do terrible things . " Reuben groaned , offered the bottle of bourbon to Carla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a serious narrationof " everything " : all that had happened after the night at the Swedish gardener 's . Mrs. Masterson received Sven 's full " confession " as to what had occurred , including the washing of the boy 's feet . In the end she forgave the Swede ( he had thrown himself on his knees several times ) , and since he was almost as good a Lutheran as she was a Presbyterian , they all , including Reuben , knelt down at the last in prayer in the den . She kept Reuben behind , after Sven 's departure , to go over and over the " ceremony " of the gardener'swashing the boy 's feet . She claimed she could not get it out of her mind , and then a few hours later , while in a state of high good spirits , she had suffered an additional stroke . Carla again pressed her invitation on Reuben to spend the night . He could have her bed , and she would be glad of this excuse to sleep with her husband on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half drunk , Reuben kissed Carla , told her she was a charming attractive kid , and stumbled into her bed , where he was immediately dead to the world , while Carla sat on waiting for her husband to return from Luwana Edwards 's . Reuben Masterson , in Carla 's bed , had been dreaming he was conversing with Cousin Ida . He saw the hollyhocks , just as Amos had described them , the tar-covered gravel alley leading down to the river , and in the big backyard , flanked by a line of catalpas , Ida herself , hanging up her clothes on the line and threatening the robins if they camep148near her sheets . Catching sight of Reuben , she advanced in his direction , took the clothespin out of her mouth , called him by name . Facing him , only inches from his face , she whispered to him her fears : Amos , a poor swimmer , had gone to the quarry and not returned , and would he , she wondered , go down there and see if anything was amiss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside him , studying him . It was just light outside . " Go on back to sleep , Mr. Masterson , " Eustace spoke . " I only wanted to be sure it was you . . . Thought Carla maybe had made a mistake about who was sleeping in here , " he added under his breath . Masterson gave a pleasant good morning , extended his hand , which Eustace ignored or did not see , and then cried : " Is Amos with you ? " Eustace shook his head . " Do you know where he might be ? " " Who are you to ask ? " Eustace rose from the bed , then looking down at the floor-boards said , more civilly , " I do n't know where he is . " Reuben pulled on his shorts , and bending over began drawing on his shoes . Red-faced , he looked up to inquire , " I do n't suppose by any chance you remember where you left him ? " " In Washington Park , for your information , " Eustace snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paring his nails and cuticles with a knife , Ace mumbled in ill-temper : " You and Amos come at a time when I do n't have any further use for you . " He looked in the direction of the newspaper scribbled over with his poems . " I 'm on Daniel Haws now full-time , with generous helpings from Cousin Ida 's letters ... "  |p149Reuben  started on hearing each name , and Ace stopped speaking for a moment to observe him carefully . " I make a rather fair pancake for breakfast , Mr. Masterson . " Eustace had put down his knife , and was observing his guest narrowly . " I do n't want to inconvenience you , " Reuben began . " Oh come out of your make-believe , sir . " Eustace was alreadybeating the eggs and milk together . " Just to be alive means inconveniencing everybody around . " Reuben sniggered . Cooking the pancakes , Ace went on : " I 'm not surprised you jumped so when I mentioned Daniel Haws 's name . After all you robbed him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Daniel , I mean he 's writing me two and three letters a week from Biloxi , Mississippi , with special-delivery on Sunday , and I 'm soaking all he tells me right up and pouring it right back into those " ( he nodded in the direction of the defaced newspapers ) . " I 'm afraid I 'm not very interested in poor Haws , " Reubensaid morosely , as Eustace set his platter of steaming pancakes before him , with a jar of maple syrup . Reuben began eating the cakes dispiritedly , then perked up a bit , and complimented his host on the flavor . After finishing the pancakes , and after having had his question answered as to the whereabouts of Carla  --  she had gone to work in the " tin mines "  --  Reuben asked cautiously : " I suppose you think a man of my age pretty silly being so badly in love with a boy . " " Are you ? " Eustace snapped . No match against Ace 's cutting manner , Reuben nonethelesswent on : " Everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awful favor if you 'd take me to him , or at least tell me where he stays . "  |p150Eustace  shrugged . " I take it then he does n't want to see me again . " Reuben studied the poet 's face attentively . A look of such despair gradually came over Masterson 's face that Ace spoke up then , in spite of himself : " He does n't want to go back and live with your Mother , Reuben , sure enough . " " Please tell me where he is . " Eustace got up and looked out the window overlooking the alley to watch the everlasting unloading of meat for the delicatessen . Biting his lip like a traitor , he said , " By and by I 'll give you where he lives . " " Mother 's dying so that 's no reason now for him to keep away . " " I believe maybe you are in love . " Ace stood with his back now to the window , watching Reuben absentmindedly . Making a clicking sound with his tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowl , washed his hands , dried his fingers on his long black hair , came back , and sat down on the floor and began playing klondike . He heard Reuben breathing heavily and irregularly and in consequence he kept his eyes averted from him and fixed on the playing cards . " Yes , siree , " Ace said cheerfully against the painful silence . " Everybody shows up here with their problems . This is the clearing house for busted dreams . " " Would you believe me if I told you I 'd never been in love before like this , " Reuben spoke with difficulty . The note of supplication and hopelessness in the older man 's voice was so grave that Ace looked up in spite of himself . Astonished at the look on Reuben 's face , Eustace swallowed , finally got out : " Maybe . . . But why do n't youp151look at it like this then . It wo n't last , and you 'll be free of him . " Reuben flailed under the scrutiny the poet now gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doughboy in the trenches . " Eustace smiled after a bit . " I think I can see how you looked . . . Embraceable , if not adorable . " Suddenly Ace scrambled all the cards up , gathered them all together and put them away in the box . " You do n't even know who Amos is , " Ace frowned , rising . " Not that it has much to do with love , I suppose . I only just know , but you do n't at all . . . Daniel Haws got wind of it though , and skiddooed , I judge , on that account . But you  --  . Come on in the front room where we can lounge more . " A dirty orange sunlight was coming through the latticed blinds in the room , and a searchlight shaft of scintillating dust particles crossed over the threadbare hooked carpet . Ace sat down on the made-up davenport , which had been his and Carla 's bed last night . Touching the article of furniture he sat on , Eustace mused : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking her bed , you let my wife sleep with me for the first time in better than a year . " Masterson stammered a minute , then got out , " Would n't Clayton Harms 's leaving have done that in any case ? " Eustace blinked and then managed a grin . " I almost wish you had n't told me you 'd left Amos in Washington Park , and at the hour when you did leave him , " Reuben spoke out of breath . He shaded his eyes with the palm of his hand on which some precious stone flickeredfaintly . " Some men are immune to evil customs , " Ace droned . " Maybe that immunity is what Amos and Daniel had inp152common . That 's why they loved one another , and always will , even though they no more than touched here .. . Take Amos , he looks frail , small bones , small beautiful skull , eyes like forget-me-nots , but he 's hardier than you and me combined . Since Daniel left , he 's given his ass to black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charmed life from danger , it 's because he 's already fatal . A strong man would have died . . . No , Amos was ruined a long age ago , in his mother 's body . .. " Walking up and down as he did when alone , Eustace continued : " He blames it all on a July afternoon in a smalltownsoda-parlor where sitting in an ice-cream chair his runawayDad give him the short sword on the cervix . . . But do n't you know that story ? " " You know damned well I do n't , " Reuben spoke with heat . " His runaway Dad , " Eustace went on , ignoring his own rhetorical question and Reuben 's anger , " got to thinking about him about fifteen years after he had left his knockedupgirl friend who goes now under the name of Cousin Ida . " As if he had been there , and seen it all with his own eyes , Eustace related the following narrative : Dad drove up in a Franklin touring-car , vintage 1913 , with side-curtains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue radiator-cap . He parked up on the lawn of Ida 's ramshackle house camouflaged by hollyhocks , dwarf sunflowers , morning glories , and wild plum trees . Little sea shells bloomed in the garden , frilled snowy curtains hung behind the tiny windows , notes to the milkman stood in bottles on the back steps , clothes lines swayed , birds galorehopped about in the lettuce , mint and sweetpeas , andp153there that beautiful boy lived , a bastard brought up more lovingly than an heir . The runaway Dad began walking up to the back door , stopped , probably to let them see who it was . He 's a six-foot four gent , who could n't make an honest day 's living if he was put in a chain gang , had been in jail for passing bad checks four or five times , all bone and sinew , cocked sailor straw hat with black ribbon , faroff blue eyes like his son 's , not fixed on life , a yearning mouth . He rapped at the back door , standing by the milk bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way fifteen years before looks through the screen , and damned if she did n't recognizehim . " Ida , is the boy to home ? " " What boy are you talking about ? " she replied . " You noaccountsonofabitch . " But there Amos sat having his coffee out of a deep saucer . " Does he drink his coffee out of a saucer like a infant ? " his father grinned . " He drinks it any way he wants to drink it in my house , specially since it 's out of my sweat and toil he has growed up to this age . " Hat in hand , Amos 's Dad did not budge , said he knew he had no rights , but asked to be able to take the boy out for an hour 's spin . After permission was wormed out of her , the Dad drove Amos to this out-of-the-way ice-cream parlor near the state line , a favorite stop for truck drivers hauling smuggled merchandise , ladies committing adultery with localbuilding and loan directors , where a preacher was shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the local fairies used to come late afternoons . After the soda-jerker had served Amos , his Dad , not havingordered anything for himself , dry-mouthed , morose , ob/served : " You eat your chocolate nut sundae more like a girl than a boy . " Pushing aside his dish , Amos turned linen white , waited a few seconds , wiped his lips free of syrup with his own fresh-laundered handkerchief . " I could be a girl for all you know , " Amos declared . He stood up and pushed the chair hard against the table . " Sit down when I tell you to ! " His Dad flushed beet red . " Go back and put your condoms on the line to dry , " Amos spoke loud enough for the few other customers to hear . " You sit back down here , you God-damned little snot , " his Dad cried , eyes smarting , gasping for breath . " Nobody speaks to Cy Ratcliffe like that ... " At a sudden movement of his father 's fists , Amos seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge into his father 's arm , and pausing only long enough to observe blood staining the torn sleeve and the cry of anguished surprise , the boy went cooly out the front door of the soda parlor . Amos walked the ten miles back to town , taking the long detour around the stone quarry , beyond the river . Later he claimed he could not remember a single step of the hike back to Cousin Ida 's , but he must have tripped and fallen frequently for his face and clothing were stained with earth , grass and vegetation . " What did that big stiff do to you that you 're in this condition ? " Ida cried , stupefied , opening the door on him . " If you ask me that again , I 'll kill you , Cousin Ida , " Amos warned her . Seems always about that time of the year , the Ku Klux Klan , not a strictly nigger-burning outfit in that town but more a combination of odd left-over law-enforcement chores and a fraternal get-together group , holds some kindp155of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was blown to smithereens some years back killing seventeen robed members . The way to the burnedoutchurch cuts across the gravel road and the big cornfield beside Cousin Ida 's house , on the outskirts of town . The processions of the Klan , announced more by clouds of white ascending dust from the crushed stone than by any sound or confusion , always filled both Amos and Ida with vague concernand uncertain terror . In the not too distant past , when Ida had been summoned into the Mayor 's office on a charge of serving liquor to her boarders without a license , she had called the annual parades to the attention of the Mayor , a prematurely white-haired fun-loving sport who had made passes at her before he was elected to office . He had promised to look into the matter , but of course never did . Hours after he had stabbed his father , Amos , sick in bed with a fever , had smelled the dust from the road and heard the crunch of the marcher 's footsteps . Terrified herself that the two events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klan might be connected ( Amos 's father was low-down enough , she knew , to wear a sheet ) , Ida put out all the lights in the house and shut the storm door tight . " You keep under the covers and stay in bed no matter what happens here tonight , " she told Amos . The procession haltingly got past the house on its way to the church ; she sat by his bed , and suddenly touched his forehead : his scalp and hair were wringing wet , his teeth clicking like dice in the box . " I have a very impressionable boy on my hands . " She echoed under her breath her old speech to the Mayor . " The damned Klan has no right to march by my house in their robes and scare us to death . . . " After a silence , Ida spoke directly to Amos : " If you'rep156moanin ' about what you done to your Dad , you can quit , for I called the county infirmary . I 'm sorry to tell you you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only eighteen stitches . .. " Then taking real concern at the cold sweat that oozed over all his body , she crept into bed with him , hugging and comforting him with words and caresses . Along about two o'clock they heard the last of the marchers coming home from the pow-wow , and when everything was dead still again , this thing happened . " Amos already told me , Eustace , so please stop ... for pity 's sake . " Reuben tried to put some force into his voice , and then turned his face to the wall . " Amos had kissed her , " Ace went on . " At the relief she had felt over the procession finally moving away , Ida had lain back hardly aware of his lovemaking and then in suddenterror of realization she had whispered , Amos , not your own Mother , for God 's own sake ! ' " " It was right after that , " Eustace concluded , " that Amos came to Chicago and into our arms ... " They listened then to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost human squeak , and Carla 's highheeledstep , meaning the work-day was over . Suddenly , under her metallic " Anybody to home ? " they caught Amos 's soft querulous tones . He had returned.  |p157According  to friends , Eustace Chisholm showed signs of goingrapidly down-hill about the time Reuben drove Amos out to the Make-Believe Dance Hall , off South Parkway , though Ace himself put it down to his last visit to Luwana Edwards , the colored psychic . He claimed she had given him a funny look and he had n't felt right afterwards . By " going down-hill " the friends meant he had given up nearly any little interest that remained in his poem and seemed to want to hear about only two subjects , Daniel Haws in Mississippi , and Amos Ratcliffe in Chicago and environs . ( He thought of the two subjects , however , as one . ) He was also , some people claimed , losing his memory . If anybody had asked Eustace which of the chapters in the life of young Rat he liked the best ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be treated with contempt ) he would have had to reply , " The Make-Believe Dance Hall . " The death and funeral of Mrs. Masterson had been acted out , so to speak , in advance by Amos and Reuben that night at the Make-Believe Dance Hall , and it was perhaps his sense of ceremony and ritual  --  considerably deranged though it now was  --  that had permitted Reuben to go to such a place at such a time . Eustace tried to hold in memory for as long a while afterwards as he could , the sound of Amos 's drawling honeylikeyet steady male voice as he chronicled the final episode of his life with Reuben Masterson . He did not get the whole of the story from Amos alone ,  |p158he  got parts of it in scraps of conversation from others , like Maureen O'Dell and Reuben himself . But he always remembered it in Amos 's voice and accent . Driving Amos into Chicago , Reuben had tried to be philosophicaland summarized the failure of their relationship . " Do n't you require kindness , Amos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require love ? I had so much of that to give you . All my life I 've wanted to love somebody , and I never could find anybody to pour it out to . My wife was unloving , did n't like anything about love . All she required was a formaldrawing-room patter and etiquette . She liked to have me hand her in and out of cars , peck her on the cheek , arrangeher orchid . And now I realize that all my life it was only men I could have loved after all , when I guess it 's too late . . . But I loved you more than anyone I ever met before . I could have been happy with you for life , had you allowed me to love you ... " " Happy with you and Grandmother ? " Amos glared at Reuben . " You have the most piercing eyes I 've ever seen . If they were black instead of blue they would kill , I suppose . One can almost see your brain when you stare so . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain , " Amos snapped . " There , you 've spoiled that for me , too , " Reuben groaned . " You who are so beautiful do n't want beauty . " " Not the Oscar Wilde kind , " Amos said . " I do n't know what I want . " " Then you 'd better find out , my very dear , very young man ... Amos guffawed . " Well , you never found out what you wanted , Reubie , and you had twenty or is it two hundred million dollars behindyou to have a go at discovery . Guess that 's what'sp159wrong with you , all dough and no character . You were tutoredto do everything . I 'm surprised your Grandma did n't have you tutored to fuck , or teach you herself out of her Old Testament . . . " Reuben stared gloomily ahead at the twin shaft from his headlights on the dark curve of road . " Frankly , Amos , " he said , after swallowing his anger ,  --  you remain a deep mystery to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois , you 're part hill-billy and yet the most sophisticated keen person I think I 've met ...  --  Amos adjusted the folds of his scrotum with deliberate ostentation . " You believe in nothing , I guess , " Reuben droned on . " You 're hard , and I guess that 's what Mother senses in you . " She sensed a rival in me , Reubie . " The boy spoke with a trace of his old heat . " I do n't understand what you mean . " Amos grunted . " Your grandmother never wanted anybody to love you . She never loved you , and she could n't have stood it if anybody else ever came along to show her how she could n't . She never loved anybody . That 's how you got so gummed up . And are you gummed ! Without your money to keep you mucilaged together , man , you 'd be in worse shape and condition than me . I 'm such a mess I can operate . That 's an achievement , I warrant . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled , as if pleased he was at last a serious topic of discussion . " You 're in her bag for life , Reubie , and when they bury her , they will bury a lot of you with her . That 's why you 're right to go dancing tonight . It 'll be a beacon of hope for the rest of your life . I went dancing the evening that Grandma was dying , ' you can tell your descendants , if any . "  | " I should let you out of the car , " Reuben said , deathly pale . " It may save what little life 's left in you , Reubie , going to the Make-Believe Dance Hall . " Whether you call it the Globe City Ball Room , which is the name that greets you outside in pink letters ( its original structure had been a car barn ) or , with the fairies , the MakeBelieveDance Hall , it was only within its precincts , Reubenclaimed later , that he had ever been forgetful of the passage of time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had entered , Amos looked up to see the big orange-colored globe fixed in the middle of the high ceiling . The sole source of illumination , it might have been the greatgrandaddy of all the paper moons that ever shone . It seemed crowded inside , with a queer odor like that given off by crushed moths or butterflies , yet as a matter of fact there were few people in attendance by crowd standards ; perhaps it looked full to Reuben and Amos because they were the only whites . They were immediately popular , Reuben felt , the moment they entered the door , though he wondered later if it was perhaps Amos 's looks and the impression he himself gave of bulging with silver and reserved favors . The black waltzers and fox-trotters were ready to go again at the sight of the two whites , despite an already long evening behind them with Terpsichore ( it was just z:oo A.M. ) Everybody stopped dancing for a moment when they entered and then the two were asked as partners , and there under the orange moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only rest his head on the shoulders of the partner of the moment in motionless embrace.  | " You said there would be no girls here ! " Reuben came up to Amos between numbers , complaint in his voice as he pointed to some dancers in skirts in the far corner of the ballroom . " Them  --  girls ? " Amos smiled . " Do n't you know that each of those crepe de Chine dresses you see covers a writhingeel ? " Just the same Reuben wished to dance only with the boys who wore pants , he said he felt he had done with dresses . " Thank you for this , Amos ! " Reuben cried , going off with a new partner . " I 'll thank you for the rest of my life . " Suddenly Amos saw in the middle of the dance floor the dreadful familiar face of Beaufort Vance , the abortion doctor . He must have recognized Amos at almost the exact moment , for turning his glance away from the boy , he disappeared into the crowd . Amos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vance 's assistant , was also present , but he was nowhere in evidence . Then it got less and less crowded , and the clock ticked on toward daybreak . The sight of the abortion doctor and the feeling of the approach of day dampened the little enthusiasm Amos had for the ballroom in the first place , and he retired to a table near a heavy velvet curtain from which with sardonic amusementhe could watch Reuben , whirling and giddy , throwing himself from partner to partner . The passage of time had by now become indistinct to Amos . Looking up suddenly , he saw there was nobody dancingany longer in the ballroom and the ten-piece orchestra had vanished , except for the piano player who was tying his shoe-string . When Amos looked down , he saw that Reuben was now lying on the floor beside him , a satisfied grin on his lips.  | " There 's nothing like the bare floor to straighten a man out , Reubie , " Amos mumbled . " I hear that 's why the Mexicanpeons are so beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swipes of straw under their ass . Of course I 've slept on flat ground a good many thousand nights alongside Cousin Ida , but that ai n't why people say I 'm beautiful . . . " Amos hummed the blues number he had heard earlier : I left my Mother , Why ca n't I leave you ? Dozing off again , he had some sort of hazy dream about Beaufort Vance and Clark B. Peebles and , awakening , found Reuben 's fingers stretched out in sleep around his ankle . " Your light is out . " He placed his toe on Reuben 's hair , and saw that the older man was still under . " You get drunk just like a baby . I ca n't get drunk , Reubie . Know that ? My heart just wo n't be slowed down I guess for anybody except old Bugger Man Death . . . As to love , Reubie , I 'd love you , sweetheart , if I felt you were for real for more than a split second . But you 're an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . To think you were a doughboy , and wounded , with a bureau drawer crammed with medals . Yet I feel I got to protect you . Your Grandma thinks I 've brought you down in the world . Fact is , maybe I 've brought you into the world . A man is lucky when it takes only four drinks to knock him out . You 've been asleep all your life , snoozing in the gray maw of money and when you 're awake , you 're in partial anaesthetic . Still even you suffer . . . " Amos rose , looked in vain for the piano player , and beganp163two-stepping with some imaginary partner under the extinguishedorange globe . " I could be any man 's son , " he called to all the empty tables and chairs . He slipped and fell to the floor . Hours later , from his sprawling position on the sawdust , he saw Reuben listening to his wristwatch and checking it to see if it could be so late . " Christ Jesus , what have I done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't you call me ? What have you let me do ? " Reuben cried . He was beside himself , and Amos understood that he would be blamed for having taken Reubenaway from his dutiful vigil at his grandmother 's deathbed . They had trouble getting out of the ballroom . The door had been locked on them , and Amos gave a display of his strength by breaking it open . A fine rain was beginning to fall as they drove up the driveway of Sampford Court , where an immense ornate funeral-parlor limousine was parked , waiting to take Mrs. Masterson 's body to the undertaker 's . She had died shortly after Reuben had left for the ballroom . Reuben sat there in front of the steering wheel , blubbering . " You allowed me to kill Mother , " he accused Amos again and again.  |p167In  his letters Daniel Haws , who in " life " ( by which he meant civilian life ) had been morose , taciturn , bitterly reserved and almost inarticulate , poured out everything . He did not even hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amos . The letters to Eustace arrived now almost daily . Eustace Chisholm 's appetite for other people 's mail may have had its genesis in the frequency with which he haunted the city streets . Unlike small towns , cities contain transient persons without fixed abodes who carry their letters about with them carelessly , either losing them throwing them away . Most passers-by would not bother to stoop down and pick up such a letter because they would assume there would be nothing in the contents to interest or detain them . This was not true of Eustace . He pored over found letters whose messages were not meant for him . To him they were treasures that spoke fully . Paradise to Eustace might have been reading the love-letters of every writer , no matter how inconsequential or even illiterate , who had written a real one . What made the pursuit exciting was to come on that rare thing : the authentic , naked , unconcealed voice of love . It was also true that people had always written to Eus/tace . Few people may have respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody had contempt for him either . They probably wrote to him for the reason that he was interested , had the time and capacity to listen , would not judge them , and did not feel infallible . If Ace offered any advice , he did so in the way of a half-suggestion , which he was the first to admit might be incorrect . Everything in his own life may have been a failure , but he never tired of listening to others or reading their mail . What Eustace had not bargained for was that Daniel Haws was to prove both his supreme reward and his nemesis in the matter of letters . One stifling summer morning Ace was curled up on his davenport reading the latest from D. Haws , when without so much as a rap of his knuckles , Amos Ratcliffe walked in . Mrs. Masterson was dead , of course , but Amos had made no effort to return to Sampford Court . As Ace put it , the same old people had him on their hands . " Is that a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting down on the floor near Ace 's feet . Ace nodded . " There is this Captain Stadger , ' " he went on reading aloud now from the part of Daniel 's letter where he had been interrupted . " Do n't like the looks of him a-tall , not atall . Claims he seen me in the regular army before this Rooseveltemergency . Chicken shit on that . He keeps at me , though . Says he knows I got Indian blood . Named the tribe , too , Cherokee , as he claims he 's an expert on blood strain . Always hanging around watching me . Says if I do n't do just right he 'll send me to a really tough outfit , and that will make me appreciate how good he is to me here . It 's taken me a long time , Eus , even to learn how to salute down here . Showing respect for bastards so low-down on the evolutionary scale makes my gorge rise . Mostly every/body down here are all little pissy Southerners . Ca n't see sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want this emergency to end . 1 got to last . I got to get through the army , for Christ , I could never come back to Chicago , and where else could I go , answer me that . I 'm in a real ghost world down here , Biloxi , Mississippi , Spanish moss hanging from trees , we 're in tents , snakes galore , though mostly harmless , this funny little city on the Gulf , with its nigger town out of bounds . But everywhere I go , in the swamp , or by the ocean , or in the woods , there 's Captain Stadger always to bump into . .. ' " " Give me that letter . " " You go straight to hell , " Ace replied . " I deserve those letters , you stingy bastard , more than you do . " Amos made a kind of whimpering sound as he spoke which gave Ace pause . " If I 'd give you one of these letters even to look at , you 'd be apt to put it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it back , that 's sure . And I 'm going to hold on to them . " " Going to put them in your newspaper poem , I reckon ... " Ace showed impatience to get on with reading Daniel 's letter to him , but Amos interrupted again with : " Does Daniel ever ask about me ? " " Oh , I guess once in a blue moon . " " And do you give him news of me ? " Amos spoke almost bashfully , not able to disguise his eagerness . " Well , " Ace studied the boy . " I told him about the scandalyou caused at old lady Masterson 's funeral . " The poet rolled his tongue about in his cheek . " I bet you dressed that story up good and proper . "  | " No , I told it just the way I heard it , without embellishment . How the funeral parlor director had not known you and Mr. Reuben Masterson were in front of the casket makinglove , and when he pressed the electric button for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience of waiting mourners , there you two were both drunk and necking , Reuben 's hand on your open fly for the whole world to get the picture . . . I added that as a result of that scene the heir to two hundred million had been read out of the Social Register and was about to leave Chicago . .. " Amos hung his head , but could n't control a wry grin . " You never know a party until he writes you a letter , " Ace mused , intoning . " Take your ex-lover , Daniel Haws . When he was here , all I ever got from you or him about yourselves was next to nothing . Then he gets epistolary , and by God , I 've got him full-bodied . See all of him . He 's epic , he 's great , he gives me everything on PX stationery . " Ace , however , did not immediately go on with the reading , and Amos took his turn to say : " Remember all those wonderful nigger love letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here to you , quick as I could hot-foot it ? You grabbed the whole damned packet , never said thank you , kiss-my-foot , and you got at least four chaptersfor your poem out of them . And remember those murderthreats I found near the corner of Woodlawn and 67th Street , brought ' em to you before I 'd half-read them , and here you wo n't even give me a peek at the letters of the one person matters to me in this beat-up life of mine . " " Calm down , honeybunch , " Ace snapped . " Matters to you ! Nobody matters to you , and you know it . You 're still mad Daniel Haws did n't go to bed with you , that 's all . Hadp171he done so , you 'd have treated him like dirt . He must have sensed it , and that 's why he left you . . . I do n't know what 's going to happen to him in the army , but it could n't be much worse than had he shared his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chicken-hawk , " Daniel Haws 's letter continued . " That 's Captain Stadger . You must know how a hawk acts , Eus , you was in the country once . He 's waiting to get something on me , and have me red-handed . Admittedas much himself . Dogs me when I 'm on KP , bobs up from nowhere when I go to town . Other day stopped me when by accident I drunk out of a Lister bag that was in the colored section of our camp here . Daniel , you like to drink after niggers ? ' he inquired . Answer that question . A real American Indian like you want to drink out of a nigger 's Lister bag ? ' I had to apologize for an hour and a half , salute my hand off , and all the time he is not looking at my face , he is gazing around me , as if he thought he might spy me wearing side-arms . Looking at some part of my body that he ca n't seem to find . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hounding and devilling me . Take my mother . After my father died in a coal miner 's riot and I took his place in the pits , at the age of 13 sole support of her and my kid brothers and sisters , she hounded me from sunup to sundown ; when she died and the kids were placed in homes , I went to live with this M.D. , drove for him , niggered for him , he hounded me morning noon and night ; in my jobs in Chicago I always got the fellow in charge who knew how to hound ; Amos hounded me , Maureen O'Dell , Reuben Masterson , all hounded me . I bet if I lived near or around you , Ace , I would bring it out in you too . But now I got the prince ofp172hounders , Captain Stadger , and he looks at me as if he 's been waiting for me all his life , and that he knowed I was born to be hounded . " One last word about this captain before I close . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Somethingis going to go wrong , and I 've got to get all my strength together , I can see , just to keep standing in the same position . I got to get out of this man 's army with a clean bill of health . I ca n't leave it under any cloud . . . " Amos had gone back to his room on Dorchester Avenue which he was sharing with somebody  --  Eustace was not sure just who it was at the moment ( Reuben looked in on him occasionally to see he was not starving to death )  --  and Ace sat on in the glowering Chicago twilight , a feeling of strange malaise stirring vaguely inside him somewhere , as if suddenly he saw the whole U.S.A. nothing but Daniels and Amoses whispering and muttering to him in the falling darkness . For one thing , Eustace had taken a good look at Amos 's palm this afternoon , not having studied it for many weeks , and he had caught a glimpse of a line in it that was new , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also . In his disturbance , Ace reached back to take up the tied packet of old letters from Daniel , and began reading one from weeks ago : " Remember when Amos , or maybe it was you , dragged me to a nigger fortune-teller named Luwana Edwards ? She would n't see me ; she had already told your and Amos 's fortune , but every time I went over to South Parkway and stood at her big old glass door , she either would n't come out at all , or would say , Huh-huh , no siree ! ' ' Why not ,  |p173Luwana  ? ' I would answer her back . Am sick in bed , ' she said . Stepped in some glass on the bathroom floor and got me a case of blood-poison . Ca n't tell nobody 's fortune . ' I knew that was made up , but I kept at her because I wanted to know about myself , and finally she let me have her reason : she seen a streak of bad luck for me , Ace , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forecasting witnessed before . " Without lighting the floor-lamp , waiting in the dark for Carla , Eustace thought about Luwana Edwards . In fact right after she had refused to tell Daniel Haws 's fortune , she changed her name and gave up her profession . He had cast a bad shadow on her , his own luck was so bad . " I saw worse than the Kingdom of Death on that young man 's brow and hand , " he could hear the voice of the Negro psychic coming to him . " I shook when I seen the signs , Mister Chisholm . My hands trembled , my knees turned to water , I done went into the house after closing the front door on him and kneeled before the picture of the Savior , and I cried till my heart would break . Does the world have to be so very violent and sad , precious Master ? I prayed . Does the sorrow have to come in such widemouthedvessels for us to drink , Lord ? " She had knelt in prayer a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word : she was released forever from prophecy and foretelling , she would give up the profane art of fortunetellingand devote her psychic abilities to her own Grace Evangelical Missionary Church . But it was Daniel Haws 's brow and hand which had effected her conversion and change.  |p174Nobody  had been sure why the Ku Klux Klan had burned a cross in front of Mr. Bates 's cornfield behind the First BaptistChurch that night in April , but later , months later , an official of the Klan had telephoned Cousin Ida and told her to quit her worrying , they had not had the burning on account of anything she might have done but because of one of the Jamaican blacks who was getting too familiar with a white parlormaid in old man Graber 's house , a stone 's throw from Ida 's . But it was the cross burning in the Spring air that had caused all the trouble between her and Amos and had made him leave town and had deprived her of the comfort and support of a son who was now , she was certain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived now more frequently ( she had written to him ever since Amos had first mentioned Ace , in his first weeks in Chicago ) especially now since Amos himself had quit keeping in touch with her . But the letters to and from Eustace were not enough for her , and she felt , though she was only thirty-eight , that she was going down " the shady side " of life 's road , without news of a son who was the paramount , yes , the only thing in her life . Of late she had had nothing but one terrible dream about him after another , and her pillow was wet in the morning from both weeping and the sweat of terror and anxiety . She had frequently called Lily over to have a talk with her about it , and once a few weeks back when she had started to tell Lily the story of that April evening and thep175Klan , Lily had said firmly , " Ida , I do n't think you 'd best finish what you 've started to say . Not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't tell me . Certain secrets a woman must keep buried in her own heart . This is one of them . We have to carry some things with us to the grave , and hope the Lord will turn away from judging us for them , and judge us only on the ones we can talk about in daylight . " When therefore Cousin Ida had sent Lily a new urgent summons to come down to the end of the road for a " serioustalk , " Lily was afraid that Ida was going to broach again the unwelcome subject of what had happened between mother and son . Lily entered the house with a tight mouth , as if to say , " If you so much as open your mouth again about that matter , I 'll never darken this door again . I 've been your best friend , but there 's a limit to what friendship can endure . " Lily sat down stiffly and refused Ida 's offer of a piece of fresh-made cinnamon cake . " Something awful has happened or is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her worry without preamble , placed the Woolworth sheet of stationery she had just receivedfrom Eustace Chisholm , and which contained the exact sentence she had uttered , in front of the music teacher . " Lily , for God 's sake , read what Mr. Chisholm has wrote . " Lily refused to touch the stationery for several long seconds . Finally she took it . " What on earth is wrong with you today , Lily ? You act like I had the bubonic plague ! If I ca n't turn to you in trouble , " and her emphasis of the word trouble brought back to both women Cousin Ida 's role a number of years ago when she had gotten Dr. Sherman Stokes to perform an illegal operation for Lily when pregnancy would have ruined herp176career as a music teacher in a small town . Dr. Stokes , a respectedM.D. , had only done it because he was so fond of Ida . " All right , " Lily said , remembering the old favor . " Let me read this gentleman 's letter . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to use glasses , Lily , when you use your eyes so much in your teaching , " Ida rambledon while her friend perused the letter , and waiting , she took a bite out of her own cinnamon coffee cake . Cousin Ida saw with impatience that Lily had now gone back to reread what Eustace had written . Impatient , she smoothed down her pretty home-made gingham apron with the forget-me-not pattern , and looked pridefully about at her immaculate kitchen . Suddenly Ida noted with astonished surprise a look of relief , if not outright pleasure , spreading over Lily 's face as she read . " What in God 's name is making you look so glad with a letter like that ! " Ida could no longer contain herself . She suddenly snatched the letter paper out of Lily 's hands . " Ida , how unlike you , dearest ! " " Do n't Mr. Chisholm 's and my concern mean anything to you ? " Ida thundered , and rising , forgetful , the empty cake plate fell from her lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with her and helped her pick up the fragments , uttering regrets . " Ida , my angel , may I explain what you mistook for gladnessin my expression ? I thought the letter was going to contain something much worse than it did ! After all , it'sp177only premonitions so far , on this Mr. Chisholm 's and your part . . . Not fact ! " Ida burst into tears in Lily 's arms . " I love you , Ida , and you 'll never know how much . You 're the dearest girl in the world . Your only trouble is you love too much . You 're too full of love for your own good . " The two women sat then talking and reasoning things out . Then Lily tasted the cinnamon coffee cake . " I wish you 'd move in here with me , " Ida said dispiritedly . " Oh , the piano playing would drive you crazy , precious , " Lily replied . " I can hardly stand it myself any more . " " And you think Amos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us ? " Ida spoke as if to herself . Lily hesitated . There was the remembrance of the pack of cards , when at Ida 's insistence , over a year ago , she had told mother and son 's fortune . She thought back to her own recollections of the boy . There was something about Rat , something she had never been able to explain , from the day when she had unsuccessfullygiven him a few piano lessons , then told him to stick to his Greek . . . " We 'll hear from Amos , in the world , " Lily said ambiguously . " I 'm sure of that . " But Ida was not listening to her.  | " The army is not going to be a Mother to you , but your dark bridegroom . " Eustace had written this as a beginning sentence in a letter to Daniel Haws . For a long time Daniel was unable to reply to this particular letter . Like many things Eustace wrote or said , the sentence had an obscure but smarting meaning which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " dark bridegroom , " stuck in Daniel 's mind as though it were the pain from a hot cinder cutting into his eyeball . You are in the arms of the dark bridegroom , the Army . Captain Stadger followed Daniel Haws about almost in the manner of a special detective assigned to him , manacled to his prisoner . Once Daniel looked down at his wrist as if to check whether there was a fetter resting there . The captainsingled him out with his eye for observation in drill , in such duties as the cleaning of the officers ' barracks , and elsewhere about the camp . He seemed always and invariablyto appear after chow to watch the soldier go through the cleaning of his mess kit . After eating , Daniel had hardly risen from the grass with his empty kit , striking a soiled fork against the tin plate , than the captain appeared as from behindnowhere to watch him . Daniel began the ceremony of cleaning , putting the mess kit and its utensils in the dirty suds contained by the first huge garbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second garbage pail with its hot clearer water , and finally in the third and last pail which contained violently bubbling scalding clear water . Going upp179to the soldier , the captain took the kit and utensils out of his hand , inspecting , pressing the texture of the metal with his massive thumb and fingers as if to test whether it would bend . " See that sandpile , " he ordered Haws . " Get your ass over there and scour this hardware till it shines like Jesus . " Blinking unaccountably , Daniel did not move . The captaingrasped him by the shoulder , and although he seeminglyexerted no force , Haws felt as if some central fiber and principal connection of bone had come loose from its anchoringwithin his body . Sitting near the sand , scrubbing the kit again and again , only to have Captain Stadger refuse to admit it was clean enough , Daniel scoured on , but the place on his body where the captain had seized him ached out of all proportion to the second in which the officer had exerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly flashed across Daniel'sline of vision , as if the face of the boy was reflected into the gleaming burning oval of his mess kit . Again Eustace Chisholm 's phrase for the army echoed in his brain and formed itself on his mouth . Suddenly nauseated , he vomitednear Captain Stadger 's brilliantly shined shoes , saw them withdrawn quickly , then heard the officer 's voice somewhere over him : " Wipe your mouth clean of that puke , Private Haws , and then get on with your scouring . . . " On his army bunk at night under the Spanish moss hangingfrom the live oak trees , Daniel Haws wiped his mouth again and again from some imagined stain , and thought back to when he had worked in the Herrin , Illinois coal mines . He did not remember childhood , he remembered only being little and called young , in the confusion of hisp180family 's economic distress , and going down the shaft , and bringing home his pay to his mother . Daniel haws once heard his mother say to a neighbor woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to give a nickname to . " That was the only time he had heard her describe him , outside of the day when he handed her his first pay-check and she had said , " Son , " nothing more . By the time his younger brother was old enough to go into the pits , Daniel had run off . He lied about his age , claiming to be older , and enlisted in the U. S. Army . His mother received letters from army bases all over the country , first the little towns in Illinois , then south in the Carolinas , Louisiana , and at last Nicaragua . But the army pay proved too pitiful to help her and her brood , and when he was just two months short of seventeen , he went over the hill . For a while , nothing was heard of him . Having never given the army his correct name or home town , the fugitive felt in time he could return to Herrin , Illinois , and went back to work in the coal mines . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The brother who had taken his place was killed , his mother died , and in a house chilled by death and hunger , he gathered together his younger brothers and sisters and told them they must break up , he could no longer keep the family as a unit , they would have to scatter and go and live with relatives . It took anotheryear , however , to place them . This was the depths of the economic burnout ( as Eustace Chisholm called it ) and nobody  --  friend , relative , church , or Salvation Army  --  could find enough to feed another mouth without a lot of searchingand complaining . " Finally , I lit out , " Daniel wrote Eustace Chisholm from the PX , explaining his life in one of those long letters composedon army stationery to the tune of Amapola and thep181clink of crushed ice in Coca-Cola glasses . " I lit out for Chicago , in a box car on the Illinois Central ... " But Daniel had at least been free then  --  free to lie in alleys , sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink , die , but free . Now with Captain Stadger he was already in death 's kingdom . He knew that he would never get out of the captain'shands unless he allowed him to take some part of his body as the price of severance , as a wild animal will dismemberits own leg from the trap to go loose . he knew from the first time he saw Captain Stadger watching him , as though he had seen him years ago in some ancient dream , that he would have to surrender part of his flesh to escape or go down forever in the realm the captain ruled . Then he caught malaria . They sent him to a hospital in Hattiesburg , Mississippi . He was released before the medics agreed he was cured , on orders of Captain Stadger who insistedthe soldier be sent back " pronto " to his headquarters . Daniel was writing his letter to Eustace Chisholm with the fever still in his blood . Droplets of sweat , forming on his brow , splattered rhythmically to the paper , while a terribledryness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more words possible of complete formation . " Amos Ratcliffe has told you the story of his life , now here I am telling you the story of mine , " he wrote . " I only heard Amos 's full story through you , Ace , but I do n't think Amos ever heard mine . " " He did n't need a story from you , " Eustace muttered as he read Daniel 's letter . " He needed  --  . " He got up and went over to the alley window and watched the Negroes unload the kosher meat.  | " Do the rabbis know which niggers unload their blessed meat ? " he mumbled . " I wonder if they do . " He sat down again . Eustace Chisholm felt unnaturally depressed . It was Daniel 's letters , he decided . No , it was the face of the Presidentand his wife smiling and telling everyone to be cheerfuland give up fear . No , it was the feeling of the something we all carry in the marrow of our bones . No cheerfulness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ache of terror that resides in the marrow of the bones . Looking at the photo of the President pinned to his wallpaper , Eustace mumbled on to himself aloud : " One thing Government will never be able to do , stop us from dying . Everything else they can make us perform , even killing one another . All our Presidents are killers , but they ca n't stop us from dying when the day for us to die comes . It 's a good thing Dame Nature thought up death after the mistake of inventing life , otherwise we 'd all go on being forever under some immortal captain or other in timeless slavery . " The man who had nothing better to do than watch black men deliver rabbi-inspected meat in an alley was " hooked " as much as Daniel Haws had been " hooked " in Chicago on Amos Ratcliffe . Eustace Chisholm was hooked on Daniel Haws 's story as told in letters , and was a goner . The poet had been fascinated by little Rat , but he was taken over by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have a name , " Daniel Haws had written . " I 'm sick to the very bottom of me . I hurt everywhere . Inside , I 'm all hurt , and have ever been . I 've got a sickness which may have a name , and if it does , why name it to me ? I wo n't remember it anyhow . Could you say , Ace , I 'm boy-sick ? If you want to call it that , I 'd have half/admitted it in Chicago , but my sickness is so big now I could n't feel any name would be right to contain it . Boysick , me that 's mounted all them whores . I 'm a whore 's delight . Yet I 'm boy-sick , Eus , if you want to say so . I 'm lying here still under the same Spanish moss , it 's not my country . My sickness , though , did n't come from being down here , it did n't come from the long hours in the mines or me being husband-son to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hanging over my head , Eus : I was meant to love Amos Ratcliffe , without ever being a boylover , and that was written down in my hand .

I 'm goin ' away , besides . " Ca n't you ever tell it ? ' I inquired . Come back in a year maybe , ' she replied . Doubt I 'll still be around here by then. : ' That 's right , I can see travel around you , will tell you that much , ' she closed her eyes . Lots of travel . It will do you good . ' " Captain Stadger was looking for more evidence than sleepwalking had given him , and he did n't have to look long . The evidence he had been seeking , however , was not one half so good as some he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his soldier on KP just about every day that month , for Haws 's misdemeanors since he got malaria came to be legion : he had not made his bed properly , left peanut shells on his pillow , torn the mosquito bar , had not shined his dress shoes properly , dirty collar , buttons not polishedon his O.D. blouse . But the unexpected evidence which the captain had never dreamed would turn up ( he was going to have to manufacture it ) came just after retreatp184one hot July day about the time Amos Ratcliffe had returned to Chicago , following Mrs. Masterson 's funeral service . Captain Stadger , not finding things to his liking in DanielHaws 's tent , asked the private to empty out the contents of his barracks bag . Obedient in the same unhesitating way as when he had responded to the imperious command of dismissal after he had sleepwalked that first night , Daniel patiently unfastenedthe neck of the bag . Out fell clothing , a package of rubbers , letters tied with string , math books , some chewing tobacco , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it were alive , falling at the feet of Captain Stadger , a photograph of Amos Ratcliffe . The captain stooped , picked it up , interrupting Daniel 's quick flurry to seize the picture , held it in both hands , studied it decisively , pokerfaced . Daniel Haws went pale and extended his arms defensivelyas if he heard a row of rifles crack over his head . " Ever notice how everybody down here talks like a nigger except you and me , Private Haws ? " Captain Stadger begancarefully tucking the photograph into his crisp pants pocket . " You and me talk more like mountaineers , I suppose . Some might even say moonshiners . . . We talk alike anyhow , that 's for sure . . . Do n't we ? " the captain raised his voice ever so slightly . Daniel Haws nodded , and stood stiff at attention . " Now supposin ' , " the officer said thoughtfully , " after I walk out of this here tent , " and he looked down at his wristwatch giving it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and after I am gone five , six minutes , say , you begin to walking slowly after me , and catch up with mep185in the O.D. 's tent , which will be vacant then except for us ... He looked critically at Daniel 's tie , the soldier straightenedit with nervous fingers , saluted . A few minutes later Daniel stood at attention , his hands firmly alongside the crease in his trousers , before the captainseated at his desk in the O.D 's tent . Daniel aimlessly tried to recall what Amos Ratcliffe had talked like since the officer had mentioned the speech of mountaineers and moonshiners , and he felt in dimming memory that the sounds Amos had spoken must be also like his and of course therefore  --  as it had been explained to him  --  like Captain Stadger 's . " This photograph , " the officer spoke sleepily , and then stopped . Daniel looked at the captain 's hand to see whether he was holding the snapshot in question , but he was not . " This boy whose photograph you have kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sudden unexpectedsound which came out , uncontrollable , from the private'schest and throat and which he may have thought was a disturbance coming from outside , Captain Stadger peered through the flap in the tent . Then satisfied that the sound had actually proceeded from the soldier , pleased , he resumedthe question . " This photograph you kept so carefully is of course a member of your family , I suppose a younger brother ... " " No , sir . " The captain stared to show careful incredulity , surprise . " Who then should be so unusually honored by you , Haws ? " Whether Daniel had lost track of time , or his fever had increased at that moment and he had missed words , hep186did n't know , but the next thing he saw was the open furious mouth and lifted tongue of the officer , the jugular vein distendedimprobably , demanding answer , and flaws heard his own voice say : " Amos Ratcliffe , sir , a boy I knew in Chicago . " " A casual relationship or distant friendship you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool and collected as he had been previously savage and angry . " You could call it so , sir , " Daniel now stumbled , having lost his way . " Or would you call it a special relationship and very close deep friendship , do you suppose ? " the captain prompted . Daniel sought mute permission to wipe the sweat that was gathering in a sheet over his brow and eyes , but his appealwas not recognized . " The fact that you would honor a casual friend by keeping a photo does n't seem very convincing or probable . " The captain had begun what was probably intended to be a seriesof carefully constructed questions when the irrevocable words , along with a sudden rain of perspiration , came from the soldier in sounds like the snapping of a huge sheet of ice broken by some distant explosion : " I loved Amos Ratcliffe . " Captain Stadger picked up two sheets of oblong paper on the top of his desk , folded them tightly together , and rose . There was no expression on his face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look up into the eyes of his officer . Then he sensed that the captain would allow this intimacy , not removing his own eyes at all from the soldier 's desperatescrutiny , allowing Daniel so to speak to gaze immodestlyand at will into that unknown pair of cold blue eyes so that he might apprehend , rather than have to be told , allp187that was ready and in store for him as a result of his reply to the captain 's interrogation . " I love Amos Ratcliffe , " the soldier now said in a heavy rush of air that escaped from his lungs , and his voice came out now totally changed and as deep as if it had risen from the bottom of a shaft . He turned his eyes slightly away from his interrogator , and at the same instant he heard the captain 's " Dismissed , Private Haws . " Daniel saluted , pivoted , held himself rigid a moment , then marched in perfect cadence out away from the tent . Once you have admitted a fearful thing to another ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the fearful thing is made more awful by reason of the stranger who knows your secret . Daniel Haws felt intense relief at having given up his secret , even though to such an obvious enemy as Captain Stadger , a man who , he was certain , would with pleasure eat his heart with garlic . But then the first peace that came from no longer carrying his burden alone was suddenly doubled , quadrupled by the anxious dread of an enemy 's possessing the secret . Sitting on a stool erect as a granite pillar in his tent , a day or so later , while Daniel Haws stood at attention before him ( the captain almost never gave the words " At ease " ) , Stadger indicated he wanted Private Haws to go over the " entire story " with him in some detail . " After all , I 'm not going to have you burn . . . I 'm going to protect you , " Captain Stadger grinned . " You got nothing to fear from me . I like you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attempting to look into the officer 's eyes , Daniel 's mind went back to the distant days in the mine when he hadp188looked up into the black shaft and had seen nothing . His pupils likewise now seemed incapable of focussing on the captain . " What do you say to our agreement ? " He heard Stadger 's voice , and to his astonishment he perceived for the first time its similarity to the tones of Amos , when that boy had been most grave with him . " Sir ? " Daniel 's voice came after the officer called back his wandering attention by a sudden movement of his hand on the desk . " An agreement , " the captain went on , " by which you put yourself entirely into my hands in all and every matter , and surrender your trust to me . " Daniel stared before him . " You 're willing to agree to that , I 'm sure , in view of the way things now stand ? " The soldier blinked , did not answer . " A man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bunk on his first night 's arrival in camp , " the captain spoke just loud enough to make himself heard . Incredulous at what he had heard , Daniel looked into the officer 's eyes , and could only believe that what Stadger spoke had been the truth , but he cried out nonetheless : " That was not the case , surely , sir ! " " You do n't mean to excuse yourself then under the guise of sleepwalking ? " Stadger raised his voice ever so slightly and suddenly touched the packet of letters which he had taken from Daniel 's barracks bags . " Sleepwalking , sir ? " Daniel 's mouth broke into a grin of horror , as the old forgotten charge stirred dimly in his mind . " I never recall sleepwalking in my life , sir . " " Then you never presented yourself stark naked as ap189nail that night in my tent , Private Haws ? " As the captain spoke , a whole wave of terrible and unknown memories swept over the soldier 's flickering consciousness . Shifting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on every syllable : " You say you were the son of coal miners , " Captain Stadger mused . " Do n't suppose you might have had as much formal schooling therefore as you might have wished , though you tried to better yourself in Chicago ... " Daniel Flaws remained at attention , but his eyes showed that he was hearing now almost nothing . " The army is looking for good men , you know , Haws , in this unlimited national emergency . Men like you . . . You been in service before , have n't you now ? " Daniel Haws , frozen speechless , blinked again . " I said , have n't you ! " the captain raised his voice . Extending one arm , then dropping it against the creases of his trousers , Daniel spoke : " I did n't love Amos Ratcliffe the way you may be thinking , Captain Stadger , sir . . . " His tone was of sudden passionate beseeching . His face had gone an awful yellow , the wrinkles on his brow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you talking about , Private Haws ? " Captain Stadger inquired , a groundswell of some unknown feeling in his voice . " I 'm sure I do n't know . " " What I confessed to you , sir . " " You have n't confessed to a thing to me , Private Haws . Whatever you may have told me you told me as a friend . Such as your telling me , say , that you were in the army before , and left by the door of AWOL , and never returned till now , under another name . In one ear , out the other , Haws . Because you were talking to a friend , you see . Not just an army officer . A true friend . . . We 'll get to know eachp190other , you and I. You 're coming clear to me , Haws . Maybe we might even take a few little trips together , by and by . .. . Not as officer and enlisted man but as two friends with a lot in common . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , sir ! That 's what I wanted to say . I never loved him so , sir ! " " How did you love the cocksucker ? " Captain Stadger leaped up from his stool like a wire suddenly galvanized into white hot death . Daniel Haws did not see the look of kindled rage and madness on the face of the captain . If he had , and had he understood , he would have gone over the hill as soon as the captain dismissed him , and he would have done well to do so . All he could see at that moment was the face of Amos Ratcliffe as he had looked when he last took his leave of him in his rooming house in Chicago . " I loved him as myself , " Daniel finished . Captain Stadger then struck the private with all the accumulatedforce of a man made criminal by all the hard years behind him and the hate and need . " You 'll love who you 're told to love , you fucking bastard , and you 'll talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the blood pouring from Daniel 's face and mouth calmed the officer . He was affable again . " You may use your handkerchief , " Captain Stadger nodded to him . Haws wiped his mouth and face . The sight of his own blood and in such quantity calmed him also , for tears were not his forte , and he was grateful he could bleed . Captain Stadger handed him another handkerchief he pulled quickly from his own pocket , after flaws had filled the first one.  | " I can see we will understand each other , Private Haws . " The captain advanced now within an inch of his face . " The army is funny this way . If a man cooperates , his life can be relatively easy , relatively smooth . Things run on and come to an end . But if the man resists and ca n't take command , " and Daniel felt with the thrill of unbelief iron fingers closingover his broken mouth and lips , as Stadger held him in savage embrace , " if he resists there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's broke down to the bone . " Removing his fingers from the soldier 's mouth , he waited for Haws 's " Yes , sir . " " While you , Daniel , " Eustace Chisholm wrote to the APO in Biloxi , Mississippi , " are being devilled by Captain Stadger , or at least you make out you are at death 's crumblingdoor , your Amos , about whom you beg so frequently for news , is , I am happy to report , flourishing like a whole peninsula of green bay trees . " I am only , " Ace 's letter continued , " if the truth must be told , half sorry for you because though your persecutor may have uncovered your weak spot , he has been summoned to be your judge by you yourself , Daniel Haws . Like all the martyrs in history , you have presented yourself at his bench before your case was ever called , and without so much as a touch from his white-hot iron on your so-receptive flesh , you have confessed your crime : Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir , that photograph is of the boy who stole my heart away . ' If you had told him the full truth , how you left your love , after killing it in the bud , and chickened out of Chicago , maybe even a Captain Stadger would not have the yen to put the poker to your palpitating asshole . . . " Yes , you who was so wise , so prudent , so clever , such ap192miser , so careful for your reputation and future , now look at you . Well , when Troy falls , it falls to charred ruins , with nothing left for anybody to poke around in . " But I started out in this letter to tell you how Amos is flourishing . He not only never looked better  --  his flesh gives the appearance of having been bathed in fresh strawberry juice , his teeth sparkle , eyes shine , but the thing that has perhaps astonished everybody , stranger , friend , foe , is his ability to wear a wardrobe . Believe you me , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being smitten on your little dagger-mate , bought him a sizable one : shirts of sea-island cotton , custom-made of course , ties from India , shoes hand-made in rugged Scotland . Even his arm pits give off some perfume that costs easily eighty dollars for ten drops ; he has now stepped out of the Arabian Nights entertainment , but he is entertaining nobody but himself . He ca n't begin to count his lovers , now he is free of old Reuben . Yet I must tell you he is not spoiled or conceited . In fact I can see something is weighing him down , but whatever it is now he would be in the same situation in any case where you left him : the only thing he ever wanted and still wants is you , and so he has even less than when his toes and ass were out and he smelled like a goat ... " Carefully tearing up Ace 's letter , Daniel allowed the paper to fall into the blue-green waters of the Mississippi Sound . " You should n't throw away an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slightly quavering voice behind him . He did not need to turn around to know who it was . " Yes , sir . "  |p193Daniel  rose from the grass . " I want you to save me all your letters from this time on . " Captain Stadger stepped forward to face him . " That way we can be sure they wo n't fall into the hands of an outside party who might not understand . . . " Carla Chisholm 's Golgotha was made complete , if not entirelyunendurable , the August following her return to Chicagoby a change in Eustace that made all her other troubles seem minor and her money worries minuscule . Her job still brought home enough to keep her and Ace in grub , with a roof over their heads , an occasional movie , and more frequently ( since Ace walked so much ) shoe repairs , though there always came that period of a week or so just before pay day when , despite her scraping and tithing , there was n't a red cent in the house ( Eustace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good many boxing matches , and handing out nickels and dimes to bums ) , and they had to go to bed without supper . A diet of tea and crackers gives one , the first day or so , the vague feeling of having eaten . Later , one wakes up in the middle of the night with a sour stomach and hunger pangs . Carla , sleepless from burdens , would go out into the kitchen at 2:oo A.M. to think things over , leaving her husband also sleepless in bed , perhaps more uncomfortable than she was , for he was more active physically and his poorly shod feet had covered miles along the Lake Front , over museum floors , and down alleys ,  |p194clutching  always his poem to hell , matted together now with sheets of PX letter paper , which smelled of Army , in the fine delicate handwriting of Private Daniel Haws . What minimized all the other accidents of Carla Chisholm'schagrins and sorrows was , to put it simply , her growingcertainty that her husband was going insane . He had always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his calling  --  she understood that , of course . She based her definition of actual insanity on the following series of events . It began after he told her that the Negro psychic , LuwanaEdwards , had passed on her " Mantle " of second sight to him when Luwana had given up telling fortunes for a living and entered standard religious work . Carla had smiled then at what he said , perhaps giggled . Then only a few days after he had told her about the " Mantle , " he began seeing events before they transpired , in earnest . As in a home movie , the things transpiring in Biloxi , Mississippi ( which Luwana had already seen months before and as a result had refused to tell Daniel Haws 's furtune ) all unreeled before Ace 's half-startled half-bored eyes . For example , he " got " the name , Captain Stadger ; he saw his round face , framed with an aureole of blond hair ; he even described his hands , strong to the point of being nearly misshapen . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters . As if , then , to prove to Carla that his " gift " was real and not a literary attitude , he would quote from Daniel 's letters before they ever reached Chicago . He also reported conversationsbeing held near Cobden , Illinois by Cousin Ida ; he said that Maureen O'Dell was to marry Reuben Masterson before that item appeared in the society columns , and he foresaw the terrible thing to befall Amos.  |p195But  chiefly his second sight was limited to Biloxi , and from his dirt-stained apartment windows he watched both the principal drama and took in the tropical backdrop  --  saw the pelicans on the Misssissippi Sound , smelled azaleas and magnolias , touched the palms and the live oaks with the moss . He remembered without knowing that there had once lived down there Indians who passed the time of day in the shade of those oaks on the shore of the Bay . He looked in on the factory that was solely devoted to the manufactureof paper flowers for the Day of the Dead , and passed by the old Biloxi Cemetery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the night , pressed against his wife , Eustace would wake with a start , and throw off his quilt , spellbound by the encounter between Captain Stadger and Daniel Haws . With helpless sick terror he saw the moon face of the officer bent over the soldier , while from a mouth which looked too well-shaped to form such words he heard : " Private Haws , burglars use diamond-tipped drills to get at their treasure . Know what I 'll use to get mine from you ? " Carla , so trained in the rationalism and liberalism of the epoch and partisan to its simple-minded definition of human nature , finally could only turn away from her husband . She had been able to stand all his other failings , but his having even an unwilling relationship with the " unknown " began to estrange her at last from him , jeopardize her love itself . She thus took refuge in the explanation he was insane . Eustace should have been glad therefore that Amos returned to him at such a time . Yet occupied as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might have been otherwise . He turned to Amos now principally because Carla refused to pursue his experiences any further . Had he been lessp196interested in Daniel at that moment , he might also have warned Rat of the fateful thing that was about to overtake him , but he missed it until almost the moment of the event itself . When the two had resumed " running " together again , an incident took place which amused and delighted both Ace and Amos . Incessant walkers as ever , they were meandering along the Lake Front one afternoon , when a natty policemanstopped them and asked Amos ( still in his Masterson wardrobe ) if the older poorly dressed gent had propositionedhim . Taken aback , Amos had tried to explain that Ace and he were old friends . The cop , however , incredulous , had separated them , and after giving Amos a lecture on the perils of picking up rough trade told him to go home . Catching up with one another a few minutes after the brush with the police , the two walked on together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of a Bethel Mission , near Sixty-third street , to inspect the wordingof a sign : DEAR GOD , THROW YOUR STRONG ARMS OF PROTECTION AROUND THE TRUE WIDOWS AND AGED PEOPLES OF THE WORLD , AND DO NOT AVERT YOUR EYES FROM OUR ARMY OF YOUNG MEN , MANY HARDLY MORE THAN BOYS . " I 've got something bad to tell you , " Eustace mumbled . Amos waited , worry lines about his eyes and over the bridge of his nose . " I 've turned into a Goddamned Negro spiritualist , " Eustacesaid . After a long walk they had reached the rocks which were piled fifteen or twenty feet high above the water of the lake.  |p197They  sat down , remembering how less desperate and much happier , after all , they had used to feel when they sat here the year before , and yet how desperate they had been then too . A few gulls hovered near some refuse floating on the oilstainedwater . " I hear and see everything Daniel tells me even before his letters get here with the news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help it , it 's so . " Ace defended himself for the first time in Amos 's memory . " Carla kept count of the coincidencesfor a time , my knowing an event in Mississippi beforeDaniel confirmed it in a later letter , but she 's given up keeping count now . Would n't be surprised she ran out on me again . . . I see this Captain Stadger , for example , he 's the one who 's going to do something to Daniel Haws , probablykill him . Then the damned letter comes , with the PX smell , the desperate handwriting but intelligent message . Why did n't Daniel stay in the coal mines ? We 'd both be a hell of a lifetime better off ... " Amos bowed his head , squinted his eyes , and looked towardSouth Chicago , from which one could see clearly even at this daylight hour the steel works belching out foundationsof sparks from the Bessemer converters . " Captain Stadger is bushwhacking Daniel Haws , " Eustacesaid . Amos winced , bowed his head . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ace mumbled , throwing a stone hard into the lake . " What I 'm telling you then , Amos , is that the old nigger woman , when she renounced her second sight for the sake of her Church , by Christ , put her powers on me . Handed me her Mantle . I 'm bedevilled and bewitched , and I 'm getting everything that happens to Daniel Haws as soon as it happens to him . **28;8222;TOOLONG the motorcycle past and started it down by the bridge . But he is about as odd as Dick 's hatband , with the whiskers and that flying suit . John says he 's got a bad case of disestablishmentarianism . " " I noticed , " I said . " He 's all broken out with it . " " And he eats only nuts and fruits and vegetables . " " He seems to tell everybody that . " " Did he tell you why ? " No . " His father 's some bigwig in the meat-packing business in Chicago , and that 's why he wo n't eat any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Does n't his father wear pants , too ? IIow come Tarzan does n't wear a sarong , or a toga ? " " You ca n't say those coveralls are exactly orthodox . " " Nor very sanitary , " I said . " Ah , " she said , smiling and screwing up her eyes , " you like to sound like old Scrooge , but I notice he 's still living in your tree . And that 's going to disrupt this household , you know that ? This one here has been after me all day , when she has n't been screaming to be pushed in the swing , to go see his treehouse . And he obviously does n't want people looking at his treehouse . " " But I could ask him , " Debby said . " Why ca n't I ask him ? " " Because he 's fussy about his privacy , " her mother said . " Everybody 's got his peculiarities . He likes privacy , Mr. Allston is grossly prejudiced , you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we 've all got a right to be what we are . Have n't we ? " " I do n't know . " " I do . So that 's why he keeps his bridge pulled up and does n't want us snooping around his place . "  | " Well I 'm going to ! " " I hope not , baby , " Marian said . " You 'd embarrass us awfully if you did . " Ruth , leaning , said , " I 'm afraid we have to go or we 'll get caught in the rush-hour traffic . But please stop by when you 're out walking . And bring Debby up to meet Catarrh . " I started the engine , mother and daughter stepped back , we were a rotating lighthouse of smiles . " You too , " Marian was saying , one arm full of roses , one around Debby . " Soon as we get settled we want to .. . John gets a week between quarters , right away soon . Debby , wait , please ! Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talk about peculiarities , you 're a swinger , nothing but . Say goodbye to the Allstons , baby . Goodbye , and thanks for the flowers . And the worms ! The worms especially . . . . " In the rearview mirror I saw Debby dragging her mother down toward the swing . " The kid 's a tyrant , " I said . " What she needs is the sound of a good firm no . " " I suppose Marian 's trying to compensate for the upset of moving . " " And the gorilla man , " I said . " Would n't you know they 'd be all buddy-buddy within twenty-four hours ? " " Oh , buddy-buddy ! They talked a few minutes . " " Sure , but I thought he despised square company . He could have grunted and climbed farther out on his limb . " " Joe , " she said , " you 're fantastic . You 're jealous . " " Look who 's calling me fantastic , " I said . But of course she was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came back around three-thirty , John was inp102the yard with a golf-club-shaped sickle cutting down thistles . I stopped . " What ? " I said . " Improving nature ? " " Thistles only , " he said . " They prickle Debby 's legs . I guess if we went around barelegged we 'd have had them down before this . How about a beer ? " I looked at Ruth , with the thought she probably had herself : we should n't fall all over people , we should n't get too thick . But obviously we both wanted to . " Have we got any frozen stuff that will melt ? " I asked . " There are some frozen vegetables , yes . " " You hop out , " I said . " I 'll run up and put them in the freezer and come back . " I hurried , too , like a boy bound for a party . When I got back , I swung in against the trail gate to park , and there was Jim Peck 's motorcycle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I crossed the parking area and could look down into the grove , that grove as an eighteenth-century landscape , leafy at the top , meadowy at the edges , bronzy at the center where the figures cluster . The sun is low along the hill , and afternoon stretches into the grove in bars and rays to pick out Marian 's faded blue , Ruth 's red , John 's khaki , the hot gold of beer cans on the weatheredpicnic table . The nylon rope , Maxfield Parrish touch not quite congruous with the rest , becomes a silver cord when Debby 's swinging brings it into the sun.  |p103John  is pushing with one hand , holding a beer can with the other , turning his head to say smiling things to , Ruth and Marian , who are stretched out in canvas chairs . Transparent flames lick up in the barbecue pit , , for it is still spring , and not overly warm . The wood smoke that except for the disturbance of Debby 's swinging would go straight up into the leaves is scatteredand blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me scented with the nostalgia of a hundred pleasant outings . Most orderly and neoclassic that pastoral grove , those noble trees , those gracefully disposed figures ; most romantic the touch of gaiety and aspiration as the child soars upward in the swing . But also , inescapablypart of the picture , the shape of Disorder stands a little apart , in shadow , gleaming darkly , the orange suit like a gross flower against the brown spring-fallen leaves . Jim Peck is not one of those apostles of modernity who go stony-faced as if wearing a sign : ALIENATED . KEEP OFF . His wild hair , wild beard , wild eyes , are the components of a true satiric leer . Through his unvaryinggrin he peers out at the world of civilization and sense like a wild man through a screen of vines . He ought to be ridiculous or pathetic ; I am sure his own version of himself contains a good portion of the saintly ; and yet the picture that hangs in my mind , remembered or composite or imaginary , places him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression that he is dangerous . He is dangerous , too , and all the more so because , as I now recognize , he has no more malice than he has sense , and has besides a considerable dedicationto beliefs that he unquestionably considers vir/tuous . Dangerousness is not necessarily a function of malicious intent . If I were painting a portrait of the father of evil , I wonder if I would n't give him the face of a high-minded fool . Dangerous or not , he is one of us . He has responded to the friendly kindness of the Catlins precisely as the Joseph Allstons have . I would n't allow the unwashed fantast in my house , but , I have to remind myself , it is n't my house he is being admitted to . And he does n't bother me so much that I am going to give up the Catlins ' company because of him . If he can stand me , I can stand him . I walk on down and join them in the fragrant shade . I thought Peck looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and my entrance so obviously added to his social watchfulness that I had to remind myself , lest I begin to feel sorry for him , that in his pretentious withdrawal he was arrogant , and as much a dog in the manger as I had sometimes thought myself for resenting him . Moreover , among his own crowd , when he broke training and came out for a frolic , he was a long way from diffident . He could pick the guitar , sing , drink beer , bang the bongos or the girls , and play the bacchant with the best . I thought I had better keep in mind the occasional girls who rode in and out with him , glued as tight as beetle wings to his back while he leaned too fast into the curves of the lane or bounced across the treads of Weld 's booby-trap bridge ; and the vision in the black leotard who had emerged into the morning to demonstrate that one , at least , took Peck seriously enough to sleep with him . There was no need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the hostess here . If he was old enoughp105to be playing saint and screwing girls he was old enough to take his chance in civilized company . Not that they shut him out . On the contrary . Having hailed him out of friendliness , they made him welcome . A potentially squeaky hinge , he got early grease from both Marian and Ruth ; so that , though I might have preferred to be part of the conversation that included Marian , I found myself talking to John about the comingtown elections and the threat of a gravel quarry in the hills , while we pushed Debby back and forth between us in the swing . My ear , however , was cocked aside , as Debby 's eyes were : her eyeballs followed Peck the way a portrait 's eyes pursue a tourist around a gallery . It irritated me that I could not ignore him . Why , simply by being there , grotesque in hair and coveralls , did he focus our attention ? And to hear what ? This : ... healthy on his vegetarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat , exactly ? ( Oh , rice , whole-wheat bread , peanut butter , vegetables , fruit , nuts , like that . ) Did he have to avoid getting too much carbohydrates ? Did he gain weight , or lose ? ( Never paid any attention . Never gained weight , no . Seemed to stay about the same . ) What was he dieting for , health , religion , or what ? ( Some of both . Also to protest the hypocrisies of meat eating . Every meat eater who thought meat came wrapped in neat cellophane packages should take a tour of the stockyards , he 'd never eat it again . ) He seemed sort of -- was n't he ?  --  sort of Hindu . Was it all kinds of meat he was opposed to , or just the killingof cattle ? ( All kinds . ) Well , was it the eating of flesh he opposed , or was itp106the cruelty of the slaughterhouses ? Meat eating was natural  --  guess who is talking  --  everything belonged to some food chain . Was n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( It was meat eating itself he was against . All the largest and strongest animals were vegetarian . He himself wanted to be absolutely harmless . He believed in ahimsa , nonviolence , harmlessness . Besides , the eating of meat had a bad effect on the clarity of his mind . He wanted to keep his mind crystalclear . He was trying to think his way below all the surfaces , past all the boundaries . The world was shut in . It was the duty of thinkers and intellectuals to help free it . He was writing a book , keeping very full notes on himself as he projected his consciousness farther and farther into unknown or half-known states . If people only knew how , they could get rid of their hangups and their hostilities and come out on the other side into states of pure mind they never even suspected . The longer he stayed on his strict diet , the longer he worked on his exercises and his sessions of contemplation , the clearer he got , the less he was hung up , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizons of perception . He had hundreds of pages already , he worked sometimes all night , it came freer and freer , like automatic writing . The things he was discovering were so exciting he did n't sleep more than an hour or two . And that was something else you could control . You ... ) His voice was soft , musical , with a throb of convictionand passion in it . He squatted , breaking twigs in his long thin fingers in a way that was a little too nervous for the theosophical doctrine he expounded . His eyes , too , retained their wild satiric gleam ; he heldp107the two women with his eyes like a pair of wedding guests . Really ? they said , intrigued . Did he do yoga too , was that associated with the diet as part of the way of consciousness ? ( Oh yes . ) And what about organically grown vegetables , use of natural manure , avoidance of chemical sprays , all that ? ( He smiled ; he indulged their worldly questions ; he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into keeping his mind and body transparent so that light could come through . ) Well , there was a health store in town , did he know ? where they sold soybean steaks and blackstrap molasses , all the things with natural vitamins , rose hips , all that , an astonishing variety . ( He did n't know . He did n't have much patience with all that hypocrisy that tried to make honest soybeans taste like sirloin . Simplicity , that was . . . ) But he was off the line . They had given him his turn , and were off on their own food fads , which were neither simple nor harmless . Left to listen to recipes for tiger 's milk and other such messes , he crushed his beer can carefully into a four-sided shape and dropped it at his side . John left the swing and opened him another . Debby , coursing up and back in long arcs , yelled to be stopped , dropped her soft-drink can to the ground , dragged her feet , and scrambled out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , Debby , " Marian said , " not right before dinner . " Debby ignored her , prying . Soda fizzed and splashed her . " Here , " Marian said , " let me , then . " She punched two holes and passed the can to Debby , who took it back to the swing . Backing her behind into the board , her eyes already back on Jim Peck , she hooked herp108wrist around the rope and took a sip from the can in that hand . John pushed her and she went up and back , staring at Peck all the time . He winked a half-crazy eye and irradiated her with his satyr 's grin , and when she came forward again there he was , waiting to push . So promptly he found his own level . It was almost touching to see him gravitate to the one person there who obviously found him fascinating . I opened another beer for myself and sat down on the ground between Marian and Ruth . In the brown grove where the oak moths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarved flat among the oaks , Debby went up and back in long white arcs between her crewcut amiable father and the bearded kook . I watched him , wondering if communicationcould ever be really established with him , supposingone wanted to make the effort . Could one do with a not-very-likable stranger what one had been totally unable to do with one 's son ? I was almost tempted to try . But I thought of all the gibberish I would have to listen to , all the dyspeptic mixture of unmixables that it would be my duty to try to digest . There would be all the self-realization business , which was itself a mongrelcross between Socrates on the examined life and the Buddha on contemplation . There would be all those far-out states that Peck thought he could reach by diet , by yoga , by fasting , by drugs , and that would begin in Huxley 's Doors of Perception and end in Leary 's LSD cult . There would be a lot of Zen passivism scrambled with a sanyasi withdrawal , and mixed with both a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be much civil-rights militancy in Peck ,  |p109I  was sure he would have a full share of inert sympathy with civil-rights principles and a full share of contempt for the people who , trying harder than he to solve something , were not succeeding . There would likewise be at least a noise of sympathy with all the other activists , the sitters-in , the teachers-in , and the singers-in against authority of whatever kind and whatever degree of repressiveness or responsibility . Could I stand to see humane feelings and noble ideals come half-baked from that oven ? I doubted it . Also this boy would want pot made legal , which would n't trouble me , and he would angrily  --  or softly , since that was his style  --  demand the lifting of the ban on LSD and the other psychedelics , and he would have incontrovertibleevidence that they were harmless . He would have a smiling sneer for people who took aspirin and denounced drugs , and for incipient alcoholics who objectedto other ways of getting high . In the middle of all this there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mystic faith in the perfect orgasm as one more way of reaching the desirablestate of mindlessness . There would be a belief in the honesty of four-letter words , and a conviction that it was the duty of any disciple of freedom to use them at all times . And so on , and on . Just thinking about it made my joints ache and my stomach rumble . One at a time , in some coherent order and relationship , with discriminationand with some sense of the possible , I might take and approve most of the ingredients that went into the great underdone pizza of a Jim Peck 's faith , but I did n't believe I could take them in combination , the mustard on the blueberry pie , the asparagus topped with choco/late ice cream . We were ultimately and temperamentallystrangers to one another . For some reason , the considered conviction made me irritable , for I half suspected that the irresponsibility of his search for freedomforced me to be more conservative than I wanted to be . With the sun down among the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grove . I could feel the chill puddling around my ankles , and beer was a drink I no longer craved . I hunched closer to the barbecue pit 's warm bricks . Forward leaned John , up went Debby ; forward leaned Peck , back came Debby . Down into the leaves came Debby 's second soft drink can . John stooped between shoves to retrieve it and toss it into the barrel by the barbecue , and in his turn Jim Peck  --  reminded ? showing off ?  --  picked up his two cans and barreled them . Marian , glancing from her canvas chair , smiled at him brilliantly . The taming of Caliban . See the rude jungle beast behave like a **26;8252;TOOLONG boy . See the motorcycle-riding sanyasi , the hot-rod Spirit of Contemplation in his helicopter suit , suffering the little children to come unto him . From the swing , staring Debby said suddenly  --  and I do n't think she had said one word before that  --  " Do you sleep in your treehouse ? " " Of course , " Peck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She arched down and then up , and got a shove on the back from John . " Do things come in ? " she said , soaring back . " Things ? " Up again , back again . " Animals and things ? " A push on the shoe soles . " Birds . " Up , back . " Could I see ? "  | " See what ? The birds ? " Already caving away , drawn backward like yearning Eurydice , she screamed it out . " The treehouse ! " " Debby ! " Marian said . Forward she came , clenched to the ropes , dress blown into lap , shanks bare , glasses focused on the hairy grin of Caliban , who said , " You want to see my treehouse ? " " Yee-e-e-ess ! "  --  in retreat , centrifugally backward soaringto the point of arrest , then arrowing at him , sneakersfirst . " Yes ! " " O.K. , " Peck said softly . " O.K. , sure . " " Maybe we could all see it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , secretly Jane in a Tarzan movie , ready to line a tree nest with sweet grasses and ferns . She only pretends to be sixty-five . Actually she is fifteen . For a second Peck hesitated . I thought it somehow significant of our relations that he glanced at me , and that his eyes had that Arab-pickpocket speculation in them , as if they weighed chances . Maybe he looked my way because I was Ownership and Authority , and he wanted neither in his pad . Or maybe I only wanted him to acknowledge those aspects of me . Accepting me , who obviously made him nervous and aroused his antagonismin spite of his philosophical pretensions , he might come to accept the universe and quit trying to pretend it was something it was n't . Anyway , he wiped his beard with the palm of his hand and said softly , fixedly smiling , " I do n't know if you could get across . " " I 'm a pretty good scrambler , " Ruth said . " Are you sure it 's all right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances ... "  | " No , it 's O.K. Only I do n't think any of you except Mr. Catlin could swing over , and the bridge is pretty wobbly . " " Oh , let 's try it , " Marian said . " If it was n't hard to get to it would n't be Shangri-La . " Debby was all over Peck 's heels as far as the trail gate . There , when he pushed the Honda off its kickstand , he looked sideward at her . " Want a ride down ? " " Yes ! " He swung her onto the back of the long seat and stepped astride . " Debby ! " Marian cried from behind them . " Oh good Lord ! " Peck waved a hand  --  Do n't panic , Ma  --  stepped on the starter , blasted the air with a couple of bursts , and roared down the path to the bay tree . There went Debby , wallpapered to his garish back , her pony tail bouncing , her little heart undoubtedlygoing pittypat . Give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree in a leotard . We followed through the grass and then stood in the bay-smelling damp shadow above the sound of the creek , still flowing secretly from the rains . Since the last time I had been down , Peck 's half-assed ingenuity had run wild . The bay and the oak opposite were a spider web of ropes and cables . The far end of the bridge was hauled up in the oak on pulleys and anchoredthere . In front of the treehouse , like a carrot before a rabbit 's nose , dangled the ladder , also hauled up on a pulley . A security check would have found every avenue of ingress hauled up in the air , and the cables padlocked to ringbolts in bridge posts and trees . Another sort of check around the tent platform would have turned up every bottle , can , pliofilm bag , breadp113wrapper , and raisin box that Peck had discarded in six months . " Do you remember our saying anything about buryinghis garbage ? " I said out of the corner of my mouth to Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't be an old crab . " All right , I would not act the critical owner , I would be part of the curious throng . We watched Jim Peck with a businesslike air ( he was proud , I saw with surprise ) unlock a padlock that released a length of clotheslinethat in turn let down his knot-ended swing rope from the bay tree . " You wait over here , " he said . With a run and a spring , he whooshed across the creek and hooked the swing rope to one side in a cleft stake . Cheers . " Now me ! " Debby said , jumping up and down . " It 's my turn ! Now me ! " " Wait , " her mother said . " He 'll tell us when . " She and John were both laughing , shaking their heads in admiration , looking at me to corroborate their delighted sense of how wackily ingenious the whole place was . " It 's like getting into hell , " I said . " All he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply , " Ruth said , and she was looking at me with real irritation . " Nobody would look better with three heads . " I suppose my feelings about Peck had been showing . Well , pazienza . Across the creek Peck was unlocking a padlock that fastened a loop-ended cable to a ringbolt in the oak . Down dropped the treehouse ladder . More cheers . Another padlock , this time on the bridge post , and now the bridge itself shuddered and started down . If he had had the wit to run the cable through a block ,  |p114he  could have handled it easily ; as it was , the weight through the single pulley almost lifted him into the air , and the sag of the bridge pulled out of line the looped cables that were supposed to slip over the posts . " Need some help ? " John said . " Send over the swing rope and I 'll come and give you a hand . " " No , " said sweating Caliban . " I can manage . " Eventually , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tottering thing still enough so that he could dart out one hand and force the loop over a post . With that secure , he strained and reached and got the other one hooked enough to hold , and then let go his pulley cable and pried it into place . At last the upper cables , the handrails . Still more cheers . Debby set her foot on the treads , but they shrank away sideward and downward , and she hung on , afraid . " Here , kiddo , " John said , and with his hands over hers on the upper cables , his feet shuffling behind hers , most cautiously he edged her across . The worst part was after they passed the middle , and had to go uphill . As he jumped down besidePeck , John said , " I can see why you use the rope . " " It 's O.K. when you get used to it , " Peck said . " Some girls in high heels came across it the other night . " " Well , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it , you can . " While Marian was creeping and squeaking across , Ruth gave me the benefit of her eyebrows . But when her turn came , she got on the thing gamely , and with John helping her from the other side , made it in triumph . " Coming ? " she said . " I guess not . " I said . " I 'm not well enough insured to be crawling around on a thing like that at my age . " " Oh , come on , it 's easy . "  | " No , " I said , " I 'm not that curious . " Peck , from the bridgehead , looked at me straight ; we had these moments , not too infrequently , when we understood one another perfectly . After a second he smiled . The hell with you , I told him silently , and watched the three Catlins and Ruth , one after the other , climb up the ladder and into the treehouse . The tree nodded a little , the leaves shook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , went off . " Electricity ? " I said . Peck turned the gleam of his eyes and teeth straight down the bridge at me . His head hunched down a little between his shoulders . In his soft voice , his smile widening , he said , " I fixed up a flashlight rig for readingat night . " Marian 's vivid face appeared in the treehouse door . " Hey , it 's gorgeous ! " she cried . " It 's a real bug 's nest . And it seems so high . You can see way up the ravine . It 's like a poem up here ! " To Peck she said , " No wonder you pull up the bridge and padlock everything . If you did n't , you 'd have the whole world moving in with you . " Her smile fell like sunshine on the hairy oaf as he leaned on his bridge post looking up at her , and probably up her dress . " If the world was the way it ought to be , I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the way people are that I put the locks on . I do n't like them , that 's for sure . " I guess he thought that was original , or profound , and showed his purity of motive in an impure world . It seemed to me the justification of every lock ever built , but I kept my peace . He was an original , fascinating . He had built this marvelous mousetrap and allp116the mice were beating a path to his door . And one mouse that none of us had counted on . For while the Catlins and Ruth were still clustered on the treehouse porch , surveying the appointments and the view and speaking of the advantages of living in trees , there was a splashing , clumping , scrambling noise , the harsh barkingof a dog , and there was Julie LoPresti on her black gelding , the horse flattened , ready to bolt , on the bank above the trail crossing . Beside her the ridiculous productof miscegenation between her mother 's cocker and Weld 's Labrador contracted its body in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and long legs , spaniel ears and a Labrador muzzle , spaniel coat and a long tail . Every time it barked its ears bounced . Julie 's face was twisted toward us , staring ; the geldingmoved nervously and she pulled him up . She shouted at the dog , who stopped barking but moved around behind the horse , watching us , his out-of-proportionbody close to the ground and his ears down . I smiled , I saluted . For neighborly reasons I always tipped my hat to that wooden Indian of a girl . As usual , I got no response . She was staring past me to where the four looked down from their perch , and Jim Peck , old Nick of the Woods , grinned at her through his vines . It must have been an astonishing vision to a girl who had just been going along mindingher own business and hating her parents , not botheringanyone . In fact , it was so astonishing that she had to acknowledgemy presence . She came riding up beside me on the bank . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth said from the treehouse . " It 's where Mr. Peck there lives . Is n't it something ? "  |p117Julie  took in Peck , the tent behind him , the ladder , the crooked little gable among the branches , the litteredflat . " Gee ! " she said . " How neat ! " So it was unanimous . Would you win the feminine heart ? Climb a tree . " Marian , " Ruth said . " John . I do n't think you know Julie LoPresti . Her family live off Ladera Lane , over east a half mile or so . Mr. and Mrs. Catlin , Julie . And Jim Peck . " She was caught too far off guard to remember to be sullen . For once she looked what she was : young . Still getting an eyeful , she nodded at them . " We 're having a house tour , " Marian said . " Is it all right if she comes over and looks too , Jim ? " Jim , already . For a man who spent so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intrusion . " Sure , " he said . " She 'll have to leave the horse , though . " Oh , very funny , ha ha . Julie blushed dark red , but she slid off , looking for a place to tie the gelding . There was nothing smaller than the bay tree , two feet in diameter , and she ended by laying the reins in the hand I held out . I too had a function and fulfilled a need . Hitchy-boy Allston . Lifting one leg in the skintight jeans and giving me a view of her heart-shaped behind stained from riding bareback , Julie tested the bridge , then put her weight on it , got set , and went across like a squirrel across a light cable . When she leaped off the other end they applauded her  --  There 's the girl the bridge was made for !  --  and Marian said , " Come on up , this is where it 's fun . Here , I 'll come down and make some room . " All but Debby came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , broad-beamed but agile . " Hi , " said Debby 's face , stuck into hers as she topped the platform . " I 'll tell you , let 's play I live here and you 've come visiting . " Beaming , not in the slightest the petulant little girl we had seen that morning , she waited till Julie was over the edge and then minced up with her hand dangling before her like a hurt paw . " Oh , how do you do , Mrs. Johnson , is n't this nice , come right into the living room where it 's cool . " Yes , do . Join our social group . Everybody else has . There was something extraordinary about the way the Catlins melted down the most resistant materials . Before five minutes were up I heard Debby asking if she could ride the horse sometime . ( No , Julie never let anyone ride it but herself , she had trained it and it spoiled a horse to be ridden by more than one person . But there was a stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she wanted . ) Was Julie ever available for baby-sitting , Marian was asking ( Yes . Yeah , sure. ) , and Julie was saying to Peck , " When did you build this , anyway ? I was riding through here all the time till the rain started , and I never saw it at all . " I stood across the creek holding the horse . It was getting definitely chilly ; the bottom had a damp , rank smell . Up in the treehouse , where Debby still played hostess , the light went on again  --  and that , I promised myself , was something I was going to look into . I doubted exceedingly that she was getting all that illuminationfrom a flashlight , and I did not believe that on those nights when I had seen both tent and treehouseblooming with light through the rain , Peck had simply put in another gasoline lantern . Yet I could see no sign of wires leading in.  |p119I  was getting impatient with the afternoon , and was glad when they came tottering and reeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed Julie back her horse , which had slobbered green spit on the sleeve of my jacket . Marian had me by the other arm , shaking me and scolding . " You should have come over . It 's just terribly cute , everything is so ingenious and Rube Goldbergy . " " Maybe a little too Goldbergy , " I said . " I 'm coming back to see you every day , " said Debby from up on John 's shoulders . " You do that , " Peck said . " Only when I 'm home , though , all right ? " To Julie , sitting her horse and watching , he directed his gappy Dionysian grin . " You too , Mrs. Johnson . When you 're out riding , stop in for a dish of tea . " The dull red swept up through her neck and face , she gave him an uncertain look , jerked her head around and saw us watching her , and angrily kicked the horse into an instant canter . At the open trail gate she slowed only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , sittinghim solid and easy and loose like a bag of flour . We saw the dark streak through the trees and heard the clatter of galloping , and then the pick pick pick as he took the hill at a fast walk . Our group let loose a flurry of thanks at Jim Peck , standing by his castle gate , and he lifted an indulgent hand . As we turned away he was already hoisting the bridge . " Well ! " Marian said as we walked across the bottom . " Quite an afternoon . " Her ayes touched me , gave me a look of amusement and understanding and commiseration , and went on to rest on Debby , riding John 's shoulders . " We saw the treehouse , and we found some/body who might take you riding and stay with you when we have to go out , and we had a little party . " To us , when we stopped by the car , she turned with a smile that literally blazed , excessive , intense , and troubling . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I love getting to know the new place , and new people . I like to feel us living our way right into it . " " You 're doing that , all right , " I said , depressed , and opened the car door . She was a very unsteady young woman . The light she shed was like the magneto headlightsof an old Model-T Ford  --  it dimmed and flared again as the motor was accelerated or retarded . Now she went on blazing as if her machinery was going full speed , just when all my machinery had died down to a three-cylinder limp  --  cold hands , cold feet , a sodden irritability of spirit . Then all at once she stood on tiptoe and kissed me on the cheek . " We love it most that you 're our nearest neighbors , " she said . " I was telling John , it 's as if we 'd known you all our lives . " " Our unanimous family feeling , " John said , and bendingtop-heavy with Debby he kissed Ruth and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I backed out . During the minute or two while I maneuveredto turn around in the lane , Marian 's smile was brilliant and strained . I had the feeling that it was maintained with an effort , and that it was directed at me to assure me that she did n't think I had been acting badly , even if Ruth did . She seemed thin and frail ; it seemed that her friends should look after her and make sure she did n't overdo . The cobweb of her kiss clung to my cheek , saving the whole afternoon . LIVE THINGS 121The first time I found myself down below when neither the Catlins nor Jim Peck seemed to be at home , I went down to Peck 's pad and made a little reconnaissance of his less visible improvements . As I had expected , I found an insulated electric cable crawling out of the cutbank and drooping into the brush of the creek bed . On the far side it went underground , undoubtedly to emerge through the floor of the tent and from there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On my side it also disappeared underground . Short of ripping it up , which I was tempted for a moment to do , I had no way of following it , but I knew perfectly well where it led , and after snooping around the pole that held my meter box , over by the pump , I found the cable coming up the grooved inside of an old innocentlookingweathered board nailed to the power pole . Somebody more scientific-minded than Peck , I assumed , had tapped into the power line for him above my meter . A plus for the twentieth century . Even saintly tree-sitters may have friends with engineering skill , and thus put the callous capitalist world under contribution . Undoubtedly , Walden was pleasanter with electricity . Our thanks to the Pacific Gas and Electric . The music for which I had given Peck and his friends total credit might not have been picked out on their own guitars at all , but could have come from a hi-fi ; for all I knew , he might have stereo , with his speakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan Baez might well have been Joan Baez , recorded . And how cozy to chase away the winter damps with an electric heater , and lie in the treehouse bunk under a good bed lamp . I fixed up a flashlight rig , yes . And power was not all he had brought to Walden . Under the bridge , drooping almost invisibly into the leafing poison-oak and blackberry vines , I discovered a black plastic pipe . This too disappeared underground on both sides of the bridge , but one inescapable intuitionand a three-minute search showed it to be attached just below the surface to the pipe line from my well . Plumbing too , then , this courtesy the Joseph Allstons . If I had felt like riskin my neck I could have crossed the bridge , I felt sure , and found a complete bathroom  --  washbowl , shower , water closet , tub , tiled walls , chrome fixtures , the works . And perhaps a bidet for his lady guests . A week earlier , I would have told him to dig up his improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell off the place . But now I was caught . What , destroy the treehouse that was Debby 's delight , and thus destroy Marian 's pleasure in seeing her child happy , and her satisfaction at living her way into the new place ? Put myself in the position of autocrat and policeman , appear petty and mean not only to Peck  --  whose reaction would not distress me in the slightest , considering the way he had chiseled on my bounty  --  but to the Catlins ? It would certainly not break me to providehis water , and I was not under any special obligation to protect the P.G . &E.; I was only infuriated at being made into a mark , and being helpless to do anything about it.  |p223I  followed my usual course : I went home and blew off to Ruth , who asked me why I cared , what did it matter , really ? If I had not taken a hostile attitude in the beginning , he probably would n't have tried to put things over on me . I did not accept her analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time that I would not , for it is part of the script that Peck 's Bad Boy should deceive his Pa , and that Moliere misers like me should be tricked by the ingenious and irreverent young.  |p124D  ECEMBER 12 , the calendar tells me . Two months since the Catlin cottage went dark . All through the past weeks the storms have come spinning in off the Pacific , and the microclimates of the foothills have been swept together and obliterated in rain , like petty differences of opinion in a crisis . Each new storm arrives with a pounce , and our house anchoredon its hilltop shakes to the padded blows of the wind , and the trees heave and creak , and our terrace is littered with twigs and berries . We fear for our windows , pounded and streaming , and look out across the terrace to see horizontal bursts of rain combing the treetops below us , blurring the ugliness of Weld 's interrupted excavations across the gully . Even the lichened oak outside my study window , with limbs larger around than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a stiff arthritic movement in it as if the 6600 volts of turmoil tearing through its upper branches have been stepped down , here in the underleaf cave , to a housebroken no . The soggy duff on the ground is constantlykicked around by juncos and Oregon towhees and golden-crowned sparrows , and the presence of these birds , which we watch with pleasure and for which I have built a feeding tray out of Catarrh 's reach , corn/municates a certain uneasiness to our minds , for they ought to mean spring and actually mean winter , and the winter they mean is so confused with spring that one used to the standard seasons is bewildered . Much of what the eye sees is Novemberish . The apricotorchards are bare , and blown downwind and plasteredagainst , walls and fences are those leaves of pistachio , liquidambar , and Japanese maple that gave us a brief New England color . Like other immigrants , we brought the familiar to an unfamiliar place , our planting impulse no different from that of pioneer women hoarding in their baggage seeds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand miles of frontier tracks . Call it the Law of Dispersion and Uniformity . Marian , who valued the indigenous over the exotic , was almost the only person I ever knew who did n't submit to it , and even she would sometimes take pleasure in the results . A false autumn , then , imported but half persuasive . Now in December the earth smells Labradorean . If we had not lived through two California winters we would expect snow . And indeed we do get something wintry enough , for on clear mornings we may look out our windows and see the redwood screeds of the patio wearing a pelt of frost . Sometimes the bricks are lacquered with ice , and when we drive out on early errands the lonely untracked bottoms are white , and so are the rails and post tops of Debby 's corral , and so are the treads of Weld 's miserable bridge , still unrepaired . And yet under ice and frost the sand between our patio bricks has sprouted in intersecting lines of brightgreenmoss . Within ten days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parted with a toe andp126show tiny cotyledons of filaree and burr clover and tiny spears of oat grass . All during the weeks when the year has been darkening toward its end , the green has forced itself upward through the brown , until now at close to Christmas the hills are voluptuous lawns , and the lavenderbranches of the deciduous oaks spread against a background like April . The coyote brush , hardy and fore-handed , has been blooming white since November . Unsystematic , contradictory , unlike anything that habit and literature have led us to expect , the rainy season is a season , profoundly different from the summer it succeeds . It is green , not golden ; wet , not dry ; chilly , not warm ; clear , not milky . It has real clouds , not the high fog that obscures the summer sky . It produces real sunsets , not tame quenchings of daylight . It attracts whole populations of wintering birds . It smells different , Watching the still unfamiliar changes come on , I ca n't help realizing that nearly our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smells in the memory of sun , sage , dust , the faint dry tannic odor of sun-beaten redwood , above all of tarweed . Her light is hot and yellow or warm and brown , never the damp green of this season . She moves from high spring to summer , and stops . In the chilly , fishy smell of wet mold or the freshness of a rain-cleaned wind off the skylinethere is no trace of her . She does not go on . One must go back for her , and that means re-creating not only herself but the season she inhabited . It was a season so fresh that , even remembered , it has all the feel of a beginning . That was Marian 's doing . We thought of ourselves as old settlers , but she made us newcomers again . Until the Catlins came we hardly hadp127a social life , only a set of comfortable habits , a finicky separation from our own and all other history , and a disinclination to all acquaintance except the least demanding . In her passion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us after her ; or rather , she set us to thinking what the Catlins must see , whom they must meet . Who would respond with the proper enthusiasm to this girl 's vividness ? What persons , houses , views , would excite her ? Who ought to hear John , in his dry down-Maine voice , tell stories of expeditions he had been on , or expound the sonar system of porpoises , or prove that whales were once land animals by demonstratingtheir modified limbs and residual hair ? A Californian who is just long enough settled to be able to mispronounce Spanish names correctly is a spider , he lies in wait to initiate others into the land of his temperate exile . Not quite anything , he has to show off everything . Somewhat to our surprise , we turned out to be that kind of Californian . The Catlins , who had spent the winter in a furnished apartment downtown , with only one car and John away part of the time , had had little time to look around . They were predestined victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles , delightful in this season ? Lovely views , hillsides of lupine and poppies and blue-eyed grass . Fine . The first available Sunday morning they walked with us through the opulent hills . Every three minutes Marian discovered a new plant which John identified with the infallibility of a botany book . We made the whole loop onto the hogback and across the school land and through the woods home , and saw riders strung out through the pasture , and put up a doe and fawn in ap128thicket . But it was a little too long . Marian was looking drawn by the time we crossed the creek below Peck 's roost , and Debby had been complaining and hanging back for half an hour , and finished on John 's shoulders . Next day she was broken out with poison oak . By mutual consent we did not repeat that walk , but several times we came past at the end of our therapeutic miles and lured them up the hill for a drink or a meal , bringing Debby so she could wade in our lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on the terrace with our feet on the rail discussing with indignation the couple who slaughtered pigeons for their dogs ' education ( and also trapped the foxes who raided the pigeon house , Marian had discovered ) , the red-tailed hawk from Shields 's pasture labored over us heavy and slow , and squinting up into the blinding purity of sky , we saw he had a gopher snake in his talons . The snake was by no means whipped . He was wound all around the hawk 's legs , pulling them down . We could see his body work , only sixty or seventy feet above us , and sense how the hawk gripped and shifted , hunting a killing hold or trying to let loose . They struggled around the terrace twice , looking about to crash , before they took their unfinished drama elsewhere . Marian accused me of staging the whole business , just to demonstrate my tooth-and-claw thesis , and I was as proud as if I had . Ah , California ! They indulged our guidebook fervor , and they forgaveus that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We made expeditions to Monterey and Pacific Grove , where John showed us the marine laboratory in which he expected to spend a good deal of his time . We did Carmel and the Big Sur coast , we visited the flowering orchards , remnants of what had once stretched thep129length of the Santa Clara Valley . We took in San Juan Bautista and ate tamale pie with a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon . We had a picnic on the skyline ranch that Lou LoPresti owned with six or seven other people , and , from a ridge cropped as smooth as a Vermont meadow by cattle , we looked down through big wind-broken Douglas firs to the surf lacing the blue bulge of the Pacific . When school was out we planned to go together to one of the Music in the Vineyards concerts , and hear Pergolesi operettas in the winery yard and sip champagneat intermission , looking down over the vineyards and woods that plunge toward the smogged valley and the strident city of San Jose . Come see , let us show you . It was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the chance to share it . This is how the New World looks , this is what is happening in the vital madhouse of Eden , the vanishing Lotus Land . See it quickly before it is paved under and smogged out . And the neighbors ? A few . The Casements , Bill and Sue , rich , openhanded , openhearted , givers of great fetes champetres and barbecues . When the weather gets hot Debby might want to swim over there , all the young ones do . And the LoPrestis  --  Julie 's word on them is n't sound , they 're pleasant intelligent people ; and if he is a little humorously housebroke and she takes herself a little seriously , only those of us who are without sin should throw stones . Because of her illnesses , real or imagined , they do not go out much , but when they do throw one of their Fourth of July or Christmas parties , they make history . She is artistic , sort of  --  creates mosaics and driftwood sculptures and things I ca n't help thinkingof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make at six or seven by sticking things from my mother 's button box onto modeling clay . Lucio is an omnicompetent , knows how to build or do anything . Try his ranch olives . Others ? We come up suddenly against the true povertyof our acquaintance . There are the Canadays , admirablepeople who annually turn their ranch into a camp for blind and crippled children . We would gladly know them , but have got no closer than a hello when we meet on a walk . Over the ridge west is an even bigger ranch owned by some real-estate people jealous of their seigneurship and lavish with NO TRESPASSING signs that have kept us from knowing them , or wanting to . For though Ruth will trespass at the drop of a wire , she depends on me to talk us out of situations we may get into , and I do not like standing guiltily before hard-eyed people with hard questions in their mouths . Next to the real-estate folks lives a former All-Americancenter who married the daughter of an Italian chocolate maker from San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but definitelySociety . In the guest cottage on their place , living in astonishing simplicity , is the ousted dictator of a banana republic . Once as we were walking across countryon a hot fall afternoon , we saw him on the lawn in shorts , being squirted with the garden hose by his tall and striking wife . But they did n't invite us in and make intimates of us . That was about it . East of us the pressing suburbs and tracts , with a few stubborn ranchers clinging to residual orchards and vineyards . Down the road , Tom Weld , busy figuring how he could subdivide and make a million : nobody we wanted to show off to the Catlins . Yet shortlyp131we saw that the Welds and Catlins were on friendly terms . The women stood chatting at the mailboxes , Weld 's daughter played sometimes with Debby , though she was a dull little girl , somewhat retarded . Weld 's son worked around the Catlin place cleaning and burning trash and making firewood . He was a willowy , sinewy boy , burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear a .22 target pistol in a loaded cartridge belt when he worked . His hair was skinned off and the top flattenedso close that a bald spot showed on the crown . On his wrists he wore leather-strap supports that I imagine were more ornamental than orthopedic , designednot to support weak joints but to call attention to muscles . He drove a molded , raked 1957 Mercury so hiked up behind that its front wheels looked smaller than the rear ones . It went down the road like a ground hog just about to disappear in a hole . Even these natives , illuminated by Marian 's friendly interest , came to have a look of rightness . Like harmless weeds , they served to complete the local flora . What if they did give me hay fever ? Marian and John , acceptingthem , persuaded me that even these had some place in nature 's beneficent plan . Once he got his spring disking done in the orchard , Tom Weld seemed to have a lot of business downtown . If I had known what he was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrace when , in bathrobe and slippers , I came out to consult the spring mornings and see what Catarrh had created on the mat . I would not have assumed so casually that the people who on several occasions walked around Weld 's hill with him , setting the beagles crazy , were merely friends or potential renters of pasture  |p132Nearly  every afternoon Julie LoPresti rode past , uphill or down , with her frizzle-chinned mongrel padding so close to the horse 's heels that it was a wonder he did n't get his nose split by a calk . I remarked to Ruth that this misbegotten mutt was a rather apt symbol of the ties that bind family to family , and men to other men , and the living to the unborn , whether they elect to be bound or not . I thought I sounded rather like Joseph Conrad in an elevated mood , but Ruth only looked at me with her sharp raccoon face and said that it was clear whom I had been talking to . All right , I accepted the soft imputation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as I could see , so did everybody else around here . And actually Ruth and I had more reason to see her frequently than anybody else did . We had a commission to keep an eye on her . One evening in April , before going down to Guadalupe Island off Baja California to study sea elephants , John came up our hill and asked us seriously , as a great favor , if we would sort of look out for her while he was gone . He did not have any trouble persuading us . It was like being a small boy asked to hold somebody 's thoroughbred . But his request gave me a fresh respect for John . Until then , I suppose I had looked upon him as a genial and attractive boy , fond of his wife but not really in her class . That afternoon , while he stood talking to us in the drive , I saw lines in his face that I had n't noticed before , and they seemed to me lines of sobriety , responsibility , masculine resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and daring , and that if he was overshadowed by his vivacious wife , he was so because he wanted to be . If I had been a father with a daughter I was anxious about I could n't have found a son-in-lawp133to whom I would have been more willing to entrust her . " You know how it is with her , " he said . " There 's been absolutely no recurrence , and she goes in to the clinic every few weeks for a check . She seems stronger to me  --  it 's been good for her out here . But pregnancy sometimesspeeds these things up , female hormones seem to act like carcinogens . So I 'd feel a lot better if I knew you were here for her to come to . " It would be pure pleasure , we assured him . And should n't she be kept from doing too much , should n't she rest more than she did ? That made him smile . " If you can keep her from doing too much you 're better than I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more . As long as I know you 're here , and ready to help if anything should go wrong , I wo n't worry about her . If anything does go wrong , I wish you 'd call this number in San Diego , Bill Barger . If you ca n't get him , try the Oceanographic Institute in La Jolla . We 'll be in touch with both of them every day by radio . " He handed me a three-by-five card with the two addressesand telephone numbers typed on it . He shook my hand , he kissed Ruth 's cheek , he said he would see us in about a month , he backed up a step or two , turning to go . " Wait a minute , " I said . " Does Marian know we 're her keepers ? " John laughed . " Do you think I want to break up a fine friendship ? No , keep it dark . She 'd come to you anyway . I just wanted to ask you for that little extra watchfulness . She needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out yet . " Off he went , hand in air . Before he got to the turn he was running . We heard him thudding down the steepp134road , vigorous as a young hart upon the mountains . It was reassuring to think that Marian had all that health supporting her , and exhilarating to think that now we temporarily replaced it . You would have thought , and you would have been right , that the principal lack in our life up to then was a little responsibility . Ruth never went by without stopping to see if she could take anybody anywhere or pick up anything at the market . I developed the habit of stopping every day when I walked down for the mail . There was rarely anything we could do for Marian , but we tried to do things for Debby . I spent a day building her a playhouse in the grove , but I never observed that she used it . Marian admitted a little apologetically that it suffered by contrast with Peck 's treehouse , to which Debby and Julie went whenever they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she was troubled by the lack of children Debby 's age in the area . The Weld girl was three years older , and her bus got her home late from school . Marian yearned for more playmates for her child . She believed in something called " block play , " and she sometimes wondered if they should have brought Debby out into the country . She and John loved it so much they had n't thought of Debby . This miserable only-child business . She knew all about it from her own childhood . Later on , with a little brother or sister , she 'd be better off . Or if she had a pony . Julie LoPresti seemed to require nothing else in life . Well , why not ? I said . They could put up a ring , and a tack shed if they wanted , down there in the bottoms between their cottage and Peck . Oh , she said , delighted , could they ? Would I rent them that land ?  |p135Rent  nothing , I told her . If I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could let them make use of a piece of unused pasture . I was all the more willing because it appeared to me that Marian needed a pony more than Debby did . She spent half her time taxiing the child to piano lessons , to friends ' houses , to parties , to the park , to the junior Museum . When she was n't taking Debby somewhere to be intellectually stimulated and emotionally refreshed , she was working with her to build birdbaths , feeding trays , frog-and-turtle pools , fern and flower collections . The introduction of a horse into that family would probably add twenty hours of rest time to Marian 's week . So we drove them around looking at stables and ranches until we found a fifteen-year-old piebald gelding , marbled like a cake even to the eyes . He was , the man said , as gentle as a kitten . As if to demonstrate , a pair of achromatic white kittens that had been chasing one another around the corral flew with their tails up along the fence and one of them raced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little darkly with its miscolored eyes , ran up the piebald 's leg and hung there above the knee with its claws sunk in . The piebald only quivered . Marian bought him on the spot , to be delivered as soon as we could prepare quarters for him . That was the week in May when the wind blew hard and dry from the north , and the hills under it went green-bronze and then gold , the whole landscape changingwithin three days , emerging into another set of colors like a drying color print . Against the gold hills the oaks were round , dense , almost black . The fields overnightwere impossible to walk through , horrible withp136barbed seeds . I did not fail to point out the change to Marian , but I took some pleasure in it : it was another thing to show her about California . That seasonal change is as remarkable , in its way , as the stealthy spring that begins with the coming of winter . You go to bed on a May night with flowery smells on the air and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crackingadobe , and the first of the season 's gnats . Some sort of prologue ended with the finding of the horse and the swift coming of summer . Another act began when we drove down the hill one Saturday morning and found a horse trailer backed up to the trail gate and John , Dave Weld , and the stable man unloading the piebald . We stopped , we shook hands , asked about the sea elephants , that sort of thing . John was as black as a pirate , blacker even than young Weld . With his shirt off he showed himself to be muscled like a prize fighter . " Sea elephants ! " he said . " I had n't been home ten minutes till Debby had me turned into a horse wrangler . Dave and I are taking his dad 's pickup in for some fencing right now , to put in a ring . You 're the indulgent owner , you can supervise . " " Supervise hell , I 'll drive a nail , " I said . I sent Ruth into town alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hammer when the pickup came back with posts and redwood two-by-fours . By spontaneous combustion we found ourselves in a neighborhoodwork party . Julie was there , leading Debbyp137around on the piebald and giving all sorts of trouble to her mutt dog , who insisted on staying at the heels of Julie 's horse and kept getting stepped on by Debby 's . Dave Weld , peeled to his walnut hide , with his target pistol strapped down to his leg and his transistor radio blasting out a Pirates-Giants game , was augering out postholes in the cementlike adobe . Gunslinger , strong and silent , he strained and twisted , gleaming with sweat and ropy with young muscle , his wrists strapped in leather , his face still and stern . Marian , catching me looking at him , half closed her eyes and made swooning motions with her head . She and Ruth , having fed us sandwiches and salad , were sitting in the back patio in the shade of a little walnut tree watching us swarm like ants around the bottom land . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at Debby as she led the horse across the flat . " Just let your legs hang . Point your toes out . " She hunched her horse into a trot , sitting him loose and heavy and smooth , and Debby came behind on the stretch-necked piebald , bouncing on his fat back and screaming to stop . Julie stopped . " She 's good with Debby , " I heard Ruth say . " She 's going to be just right . You 're lucky . " " Except I 'll never get Debby into a dress again , " Marian said . " Now it 's jeans and an old sweatshirt with the arms cut off , notice ? " Through the heat of the afternoon we worked together in the sun and dust , young Weld digging holes , John and I setting posts . Actually I did n't work much . I held the level on them while he shoveled in earth and tamped it down with a length of two-by-four . Down in the grass , the transistor reported strike-outs , hits , doublep138plays ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the weeds as if there were a trap door down into some region of the strengthless but unappeased dead . We talked about seals , their varieties , their migration habits , their breeding grounds , and the recovery of some of the species from near-extinction . Later on , in June , John was going up to the Pribilof Islands to be there when the female fur seals pupped . He wanted to study their learningrate . Any animal that could learn to swim and look after itself in a week struck him as interesting . I eased my back , straightening up , and he did the same . I said , " You 'll be gone part of the summer , too , then . " He knew what was on my mind ; his heavy shoulders went up , his mouth went down , his hands went out in a gesture so Gallic it seemed he was imitating someone . " She wo n't hear of anything else . The gestation of seals is supposed to be more important to me and my career than her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She says she 's gotten along fine . Is that right ? " " I think so . Ruth does too . She 's gained a little weight , she 's brown , she 's out in the sun a lot . Do n't you think she looks better ? " " I do , " John said . " I 'm grateful to you both . " " It 's total pleasure . " He looked at me with his sharp blue fisherman 's eyes , and smiled as if his mind were somewhere else . Exercise had gathered pebbles of sweat on his brown forehead , his chest and shoulders looked oiled . " What the hell , " he said , " why are we slaving here as if we had a contract ? I 'm only going to be home three days . How about some feminine companionship ? After sea elephants it looks pretty good . " He threw the shovel clanging on thep139bard adobe . " Dave ? Let 's take five . How about a Coke or a beer ? " Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole and knocked it out of the auger . Julie was leadingDebby through the trail gate . The mongrel stood aside , ducking to try to get between the horses . His draggled beard was matted with burrs . As we walked up to where Marian and Ruth sat with a bucketful of iced drinks on the table beside them , the sweat flies buzzed around me with a noisy , frantic insistence to entrap themselves in the hairs of my ears , and I had an epiphany , an instant bright awareness of how that ridiculous dog must feel all the time . Dave Weld stood a moment by the pail , slanted a look at us , and picked out a can of beer . He went halfwayback to the corral and sat down with his back against an oak and pulled the tab off the can and drank . His eyes were fixed on something across the creek . I looked , and there was Peck , on the porch of his tent . It annoyed me to see him there , spying on our pleasantneighborhood labors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diurnal irritation , had been won over and brought in . And there sat Peck , watching us for God knew how long without even giving us good day . Why had n't he swung on his Tarzan rope across the creek and offered to help ? The Catlins had been kind to him , he knew that John was just back , all the junior admirers of his treehouse were present , why not join in ? Was he , I wondered , annoyed that his privacy was going to be invaded by the horsy activities of those girls ? I was myself annoyed enough to hope so . " What 's he doing , watching the squares work ? " I said to Ruth.  |p140Marian  leaned over and motioned me to her side . From there I got a clearer view between the trees . " Watch ! " Marian said , and shrugged her shoulders up around her ears like a gleeful little girl . Peck was sitting on the deck , his head as big as a keg with hair , his bare back straight , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The transistor talked to itself down in the grass to our left , and I heard Julie say something to Debby in the lane , but I paid no more attention than Peck did . He stared straight ahead , I stared at him . " What is he , in a trance or something ? " I said . " Yoga ! " Ruth whispered in scorn . " He 's exercising . " " Are you sure he 's alive ? How long has he beenthere ? " " Ten or fifteen minutes . " " He 'll wear himself out , " I said . " All that violence is bound to have an effect on his system . " " Oh , you know about yoga , for goodness ' sake , " Ruth said . " You do it sitting down , a lot of it . You 're exercising muscles deep inside . " " Every system has its own rules , " Marian said . " You 're right , " I said . " But a rule that might apply to all systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you see them doing something laborious , you offer to lend a hand . Or at least you say hello . " " What a moralist , " Ruth said . " Watch this , you might learn something that would be good for your back . " From our shade we looked across the blazing , trampled bottoms to the tree-backed stage where Peck sat between his legs in his cut-off jeans . I could not see him move one single muscle , though perhaps he was taking one of those locks , chin or tongue , or contracting his analp141sphincters , or doing something else inward . After a long time he rocked suddenly forward and kicked himself into a headstand . His hands were clasped around the back of his neck , his elbows made a tripod on which he balanced a moment , wobbling . Then his legs , which had been folded insectlike on his chest , straightened until his bare toes pointed upward . " Ahhhhh ! " said the admiringwomen on my right and left . I held the watch on him until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few feet ahead of where he had sat before . " Three minutes and twenty seconds , " I said . " What 's the record ? " They were much too interested to pay any attention to my carping . They sat breathlessly watching . Braced against the tree , the beer can forgotten in his hand , Dave Weld was watching while the ballgame shrilled unheededfrom the grass . Julie , bringing her pack train in the gate , saw us all sitting there entranced , and now she was watching . What the hell , we were all watching . With that many eyeballs focused on him he might have felt as if he were being caressed by the suction cups of an octopus . But he did n't watch us . He was above us , beyond us , way out . In a pig's-eye . He was aware of us as an actor is aware of his audience . Intent on his act , he lay back and bridged from head to heels , thrusting his skinny rib cage into the air . Then he lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he pushed up again . His upthrustbeard quivered . Strain or heat waves ? " You still think it 's easy ? " Ruth said . Peck rocked , and once again was sitting between his legs . " Pelvic posture , " Ruth said to Marian . " That 's a basic one . " For a time he sat immovable , unless some/where inside him some secret muscle was clenching and relaxing . At last he stood up and stooped into the tent , to come out again with a glass which he tilted up for a long mouthful . Leaning out over the edge of the deck , he brought his head and shoulders into a streak of sun , and in an instant his whole hairy top was haloed in spray . With a little more careful staging he might have made a rainbow . " Elephant mudra , " Ruth said . " You blow water through your nose . It 's one of the cleansings . This is as good as a twenty-dollar lesson . " Peck took a handkerchief , towel , rag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , and pulling his tongue far out of his mouth , he massaged around in his throat . He spat over the edge , he tossed the rag into the chair , he sat down again and pulled first one foot , then the other into his lap . " Can you see ? " Ruth was whispering excitedly . " That 's the lotus posture . That 's hard ! It 's the best one for meditation because your lower limbs are all locked and you 've got a firm base . " " You think he 's meditating ? " I said . But when their heads turned  --  Marian 's inquiring , Ruth 's cocked like the head of someone turning to shush a talker behind her at a play  --  I did n't go ahead and say what was in my mind : that Peck was a long way from true meditation , that he could n't have been more conscious of being watched , that down below there , wink ! was going his little old anal sphincter , the window of his soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drained my can of beer and set it down , not softly . " How about finishing that fence ? " I said . " If I watch this any longer I 'll begin to twitch . " Peck sat immovable upon his locked posterior . Thep143Catlins were both laughing . " Joseph Allston , you have a closed mind , " Marian said . " Closed to phonies and show-offs . " " I do n't understand you , " Ruth said . " When Murthi was writing his book you were more interested than I was . John and Marian looked inquiring . Who 's Murthi ? " Murthi was a friend of mine , a client , " I said . " He wrote a couple of books interpreting Indian philosophy for Westerners . Sure I was interested . He had a good mind , he was neither a phony nor a show-off . He did n't convert me , but I listened . When this kid comes out into the view of the crass materialist world to exercise his spiritual rectum , I 'm not interested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapprove of me , Marian 's are merry and speculative and squinting as she tries to figure out whether I mean this or am mainly kidding . John stands up laughing . " I hope you never get mad at me , " he says . He looks sideward at Peck , immobile and immutable on his pedestal . " Well , the show seems to be over . Shall we go work off your rage ? " " I never get mad , " I said . " I only hold grudges . Ask Ruth . " It was casual and funny . And yet I really did think Peck had put on his show out of a trivial juvenile desire to show off , and I really could n't laugh , as I should have , and feel indulgent . I was definitely grumpy as we went down into the sun where Dave Weld had begun industriously to grind away at another posthole . And it did n't do my state of mind a great deal of good when I looked over  --  just once , I could n't resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still blissfully unaware of our presence fifty yards away . He had a book in hisp144hand , up on the deck of his treehouse , but it seemed to me that he was not reading ; he was slyly watching us sweat down there in the sun . His right forearm made short , regular jerking motions that meant he was throwingsalted peanuts or raisins into the pulsating vacuole in his beard . About five o'clock all the posts were in . We left Dave Weld nailing on two-by-four rails and went around into the grove , where it was cooler , for a drink . Julie had led Debby off up the horse trail across the creek , but just as we were putting the tools away they came back and tied the horses inside the incomplete corral and went to work on them with currycomb and brush . I had an impression , which considering they were both fifteen or sixteen was natural enough , that Julie was inordinately aware of Dave 's walnut torso working its muscles a little way beyond her , and that he in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . He set and drove spikes with great blows . His muscles contracted so , under his sweaty skin , that he reminded me of Julie 's mutt dog , now asleep under an oak . Yapping , he contracted his body in just that convulsive way . You could see his bark in his anus . And guess what that brought to mind . Wink ! Maybe I was beginning to twitch . There were too many people around there exercising their muscles beforeaudiences which they did not deign to notice . I was glad to get around the house and get a cold glass in my hand and lie back in a canvas chair and listen to John , who paid the most scrupulous and smiling attention to every member of his audience , tell us about the social habits of sea elephants . After a while I became aware that the hammeringp145down in the ring had stopped , and I momentarily expected to see Dave Weld come past the house on his way home in the old Mercury with the red primer on the molded fenders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , and no sign of Julie and Debby either . Then in a pause we heard the sounds of a guitar being tuned . Marian stood up and called . " Debby ? Deb . . . by ! " " I 'll take a look , " I said , and went around the back of the house to the patio . The stage of Peck 's tent was more crowded this time . They were all there in a cluster . Movie hero with his six gun , horsy girl with bareback seat , six-year-old with solemn glasses , they sat entranced around their hairy guru , under the bo tree . So Peck never did exactly join us ; he ran a rival shop . Telling myself that he was only a temporary squatter who could be evicted when I chose , I saw him spread like a wild cucumber vine . He had his split-level pad beyond the defended moat which I could cross neither physically nor spiritually , nor wanted to . His Honda was housed in the unauthorized shed by the trail gate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and again without asking permission , Peck nailed a secondhand mailbox next to mine and daubed his name on it with a finger dipped in black : J. PECK . The longer he stayed , the less time he spent in meditationor in solitude . Either his intentions matured duringthe months while he was getting his tree in order , or he had discovered students whom he could influence.  |p146He  began , clearly , to think of himself as a guru , and his attractiveness was obviously enhanced by the improvementshe had made in my poison-oak patch . If the Catlins had been bothered , I might have run him out  --  or would I ? Would I ? I do n't know . When I was n't being excessively irritated by his willingness to stretch into an ell every inch I gave him , I was willing to admit that he was simply a kid , maybe a bright kid , with most of his generation 's idealistic fantasies and a pretty good sense of theater . And yet I never lost my sense that we were adversaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that Marian and John , who looked upon him and his crowd as anthropologists might have looked upon a village of picturesque head-hunters , had no comprehensionof the emotional antagonisms that lay in us like surly dogs at the end of a chain , ready to leap up and growl at a step . If I had eradicated Peck 's nest to simplify my life , I would have been guilty of subtractingfrom the pleasure the Catlins took in their new life , and I probably would have hated myself to boot . Nevertheless I could not keep my mouth shut . " Do you think Julie should be taking Debby over there all the time ? " I asked Marian one day . I had dropped in after picking up the mail , and found her in the patio hulling strawberries . The air was rich with the smell of boiling jam . I saw the black gelding in the corralwith the piebald . From across the creek came the sound of the guitar . As her stained fingers pulled blossomsfrom the berries and dropped blossoms in one pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scented shade in the amused-serious way she had , as if giving a ridiculous remark every chance to make sense before she laughed at it . She shook her head.  | " He and his bunch are all right . In a way , they really are sort of saintly . " " Saintly ! My God . " " They 're kind , " she said . " They do n't push anybody around . They treat children like people . Debby adores them . " " Naturally . They 're all about her age . " " What 's wrong with that ? Do n't you believe all that about little children and the Kingdom of Heaven ? Here . " Reaching , she stuck a great strawberry between my lips , but as soon as my mouth was clear of the succulentpulp I said , " One of the dangers of grown-up little children is that they have a child 's judgment and an adult 's capacity to do harm . " " What harm could they do Debby ? " " Oh , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " Pot , then . They all swear it 's so harmless , and they 're so kind . " About to answer , she heard or smelled something in the kitchen , laid her pans aside , and rushed in . A minute later she came out , and reassembling her work in her lap she said seriously , " Maybe they do smoke pot , I supposethey do , everybody their age seems to . But I 'm sure they do n't give her any . " " How can you be sure ? " " I ca n't , I guess . I just trust them not to . " " What about Julie ? " Marian had continued to spend much of her time cultivating health . Her arms and hands and legs were deeply tanned , she had gained more weight , her eyes were a clear blue and white flash in her brown face . She frowned . " Yah , " she said as if disgusted . " That hasp148bothered me a little . They treat both her and Dave like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a joke to initiate them . But if it 's harmless , and John thinks it is , more or less , then it 's no worse than if a couple of fifteen-year-olds had a few drinks , is it ? " " The police would think it was a little worse . " " Well , what would you do ? I can hardly forbid her to go over . " " Her mother could . " " I wonder , " Marian said . " That 's such a fierce girl , sometimes . She 's so full of rebellion , what her mother tells her not to do is exactly what she has to do . " " Does Fran know she goes over there all the time ? " " I do n't know . I suppose she thinks she 's here babysitting . " She moved her hands irritably in the pan of berries and scowled at me uncertainly . " If I did n't have her as a sitter , she 'd be over anyway . Maybe it 's better if she has Debby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " I guess she 's her parents ' problem , and she 's probably insoluble . " " Ah , " Marian said , smiling , " she 'll get over it . Given a chance , we all grow up . Julie wants to be taken as an equal , not as a child . That 's why she finds Peck 's crowd so much more interesting than her mother . They are n't really hoodlums , Joe . All they do is sit around and talk about the good life , the ideal life . That should n't corruptthe young , should it ? " " It depends on how they define the good life . " " They define it as freedom . Absolute freedom . " " That 's what I thought , " I said . " Anything goes , is thatit ? " " That does n't seem to be it  --  well , technically it might be , but mainly they seem to believe in the natural virtuep149of primitive man . They 're romantics , I suppose . Man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She giggled suddenly , eying me as if she thought I might explode . " Did I tell you they 've painted a motto on a board and nailed it to the tree ? BE YOURSELF . GOOD IS ' THE SELF SPEAKING FREELY , EVIL IS WHAT PUTS THE SELF/ DOWN . " " Oh , that 's pretty ! " I said . " Did Peck write that ? " " I guess so . Maybe he borrowed it . Why , do n't you believe in freedom ? " " Not to any great extent , " I said . " What 's Peck doing when he sits down to his yoga ? Speaking freely ? " Looking at me doubtfully , she pulled the blossoms from three or four berries . She waved a wasp away from the pan . " But yoga is self-discipline , " she said . " Is that what you mean ? That he 's contradicting himself ? They are n't opposed to self-discipline , only to the traditional and conventional kinds that they think are antilife . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with a frown , she said , " What are you getting at , you debater ? " " No debater , " I said . " I just want to keep this conversation on the track . Yoga is a system of very strict rules , none of them invented by Jim Peck . Absolute freedom , my foot . You ca n't open your mouth or move your hand without living by rules , generally somebody else 's , and that goes for those birdbrains across the creek , too . It 's the beginning of wisdom when you recognize that the best you can do is choose which rules you want to live by , and it 's persistent and aggravated imbecility to pretend you can live without any . But if you say they 're harmless , they 're harmless . I only brought them up because I hoped they were a nuisance to you . "  |p150Smiling  , torn between hearing me out and dealing with a renewed emergency in the kitchen , she was sidling toward the door , and at the last word she bolted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot of jam in one hand and a great spoon in the other , lifting red spoonfuls into the air and letting them drop back , testing . " Oh , damn ! " she said , and knocked the spoon clean and fished for the wasp that had dived in . Carefully , she lifted him out and carried him to the hose bib . The water flooded him out onto the ground , and she rinsed the spoon and scooped him up again , slimed with jam and stickily crawling , too encumbered even to buzz , and washed him a second time , gently , and set him on the window sill to dry off . So I went on picking up my daily beer cans along the lane where the freedom force threw them , and every day or so I built a little bonfire on the asphalt road by the mailboxes to get rid of the throwaway newspapers , boxholderletters , free samples , and other junk mail that began finding its way to Peck , as to other mortals , the hour he announced himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or carried it away , but pawed it out contemptuously onto the ground , where it lay or blew until I gathered and burned it . As if they were ordinary people , and not fantastic adolescent freaks , I gave good day to the unkempt young men and apache girls who came in and out , most of them in the Illinois Volkswagen bus that had now reappeared , apparently to stay . I used to see them fil/ing around Debby 's ring toward the bridge , bearing sacks of groceries and six-packs of beer . Invariably they wore a look of excitement as if headed for an audience with the Most High . The Most High Himself moved among them with a new , pantherine dignity , smiling his ambush smile and gleaming with his hypnotic eyes , benevolently dispensing sanction and welcoming all to the uses and premises of absolute liberty . But newcomers , Julie told Marian , who told me , were not necessarily admitted to the Presence . Sometimes they spent a whole afternoon and evening there and never saw the holy one , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservation of the sacred person was so fantastic that I slapped my naked head when I heard of it . I asked Marian what had happened to the absolute-freedom rule . Why did n't the neophyte , speaking freely and not letting anything put the self down , simply climb up the ladder and barge in ? Self-restraint , she said , baiting me . Yes , I said , taking the hook . Taking it ? Gulping it , plunging for it . Yes , self-restraint enforced by a rule , or by a taboo , which was worse . Holy holy holy . Was it death to eat out of his rice bowl or touch his coveralls ? She only laughed at me . She thought of them as kids playing Utopia . Which , if I could forget the harm they were capable of , I might admit they were . By few and many I observedthem sitting or lying around Peck 's untidy flat beyond the web of ropes and cables and the crooked loop of the bridge  --  safe from intrusion , escaped from Babylon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Peck 's charisma . I saw the favored ones sitting with him on the treehouse porch , throwingp152their beer cans down into the brush . Put away your nets and follow me . Once their college closed in June , the group settled down to six or eight regulars , including the Volkswagencrowd . They were as fully in residence as Peck himself . The Honda had been removed from its winter quarters in the shed , and stood under canvas by the bay tree . The shed was filled with mattresses , folding chairs , card tables , cartons of books , wastebaskets filled with junk , the sort of shabby indispensable paraphernalia that passes from student to student or from student to secondhand dealer and back to student , and into storageand out again , providing at intervals the sitting and sleeping needs of generations of the penniless young . Maybe this stuff was being kept for someone during the summer , maybe it was being stored against some planned enlargement of the establishment . I saw it , as I passed back and forth , with uneasiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so little value , was to be quaintly free . Many nights we saw them sitting around a fire and heard them singing . ( No fires , remember ? But that was a rule imposed from without . ) The first time I saw the fire I was furious all over again at Peck 's calculated challengingof every restriction I had laid down . But even in my anger I do n't believe I ever contemplated going over and making him douse it . I told myself that by now his fiat was trampled so bare there was little hazard ; that the creek , after all , made a firebreak ; that the horses had picked the bottom land down to the adobe so that nothing could spread ; that anyway Peck had all the water in my well to fight fires with . The fact was , I wanted no confrontation with Jim Peck ; and I avoidedp153it not because it would bother him , but because it would bother me . It was a permanent gypsy camp . Mornings , sleeping bags lay like khaki cocoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jeans moved around the fire : either Peck had given up his vegetarianism or he did not insist on it for his followers , for I often smelled hamburgersbroiling . Afternoons , a lot of bare feet and sandals might be propped against the lower corral rail and a lot of eyes might watch through altogether too much hair while Julie gave Debby lessons in seat and hands around the ring . Apache girls exposed a lot of leg , climbing on the old piebald for a turn . Unkempt boys leaped aboard the startled old thing and kicked him into a canter up the lane , showing off as if they had been normal adolescents , while Julie sat firmly aboard her gelding to prevent anyone from trying to ride it , and Peck looked down indulgently , lounging in the treehousedoor . Play away , my children . Anything goes , even fun . It was so incongruous to see those refugees from an intellectual coffeehouse disporting themselves in countrypleasures that I half liked them , and this despite the probability that they were as promiscuous as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were two girls who were always around , and so far as I could see , they belonged to no one in particular or everybody at large . John told me , with some amusement , that the one called Margo was a founder of something called the Committee for Sexual Freedom that had chapters at all the colleges in the area and had staged spring demonstrationsin some of them . We did not see their faces in the newspaper photographs of sit-ins and vigils thatp154came up that summer all over the Bay Area like alkali salts in a drying lake bed . They did not go in for antiVietNam parades , they did not picket the makers of napalm . They went to the heart of the matter : sexual freedom . The only time I saw Margo 's face in the paper , she had been photographed while conducting a rally to legalize abortion . " My God , " I said to Ruth , " it 's the Oneida Colony all over again . First thing you know they 'll begin to manufacturesilverware . Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I doubt my sanity . " " Not sponsors , " Ruth said . " Neutral observers . So observe . " O.K. , " I said , " I 'll observe . But if I were Marian I'dobserve with less complacency , and if I were the LoPrestis I 'd observe with no complacency whatever , and if I were Tom Weld my hair would be standing on end with horror and disbelief . Have you seen what that gun-toting rural Adonis is turning into ? Did you see him up on the bulldozer the other day , grading the road ? " For there was no doubt that Peck , who never appeared in the papers and who had no cause but absolute freedom , had captured the neighborhood youth . More than once , after Debby had been called protesting in to supper , I saw Julie sitting cross-legged among the bohemians around the tent , tilting and rocking with laughter or laboriously learning the changes of some guitar tune . More than once , as we came home at night , we saw Dave Weld 's molded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's chain saw and made the bacchants a woodpile , using his muscle and his country skills ( and my trees ) as an entree into the society he coveted . He quit carrying the pistol : oldp155ahimsa got him . And by the end of June the flat-top haircutthat had once been so short his skull was tanned had grown out to a prickly reddish brush . I offered to bet Ruth that it would go all the way to a John-the-Baptist bob , and I would have won , too . It used to fascinate and frustrate me to imagine the comments that hairdo got from Tom Weld , who whatever he was was no longhair . On the other hand , he probably never noticed ; he was not much for noticing . Peck 's whole menage , neighborhood and otherwise , piled in and out of the Catlin cottage as I had seen the summer crowd pile in and out of places on Vermont lakes . They were completely relaxed with Marian , and with John when he was at home . With us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politeness about them  --  non timeo sed caveo . All except the Margo girl , one of those who are aware every waking minute of every square inch of their bodies . She , I thought , was provocative , but I withstood her charms . As for Peck himself , assuming that I did not misread his attitude toward me , it must have tickled him to have me in a position where I would permit the whole camel to creep into the tent rather than seem petty . He robbed from the rich and gave to the poor , that one . His morality , which I was sure did not all come from the Upanishads , would have told him that he was making it , and that to make it was good . On the other hand , he seemed as willing to evade a direct confrontation as I was , for he never discussed any of his theosophy-andwaterfaiths and two-candle-power illuminations in my hearing . When I was around he was invariably quiet , polite , soft-voiced , and he smiled as if he knew something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended his philosophical regurgitations . I say philosophical : occasionally a philosopher was his source . More often , his enthusiasms were straight out of old James Dean movies and Ginsberg poems . That was one of the things about him that was hardest to swallow . There was so much Dean in his Ginsberg . One day I came up from the mailboxes just as Peck was mounting his Honda in the Catlins ' little parking area . He came toward me along the foot of the hill , barechested , bare-legged in his cut-off Levis , insect-headed in the white helmet , and as he passed with a gust of hot air and dust-and-oil smell , he gave me his gleaming , knowing , wordless smile through his beard . Ten feet down the road ( did I imagine this ? ) he goosed the motorcycleinto a derisive snort . I turned to look after him . He was just crossing the bridge , attentive to the narrow tread his wheels followed , but as he reached the other side he looked back . We exchanged some sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Walking on , I saw Marian stretched in the old lounge in the grove . She waved me down , and I went , though I was not overjoyed to be succeeding Peck as her visitor . And I could n't ignore him , as I probably should have . I had to spit him out of my mouth . " Been having a discussionwith our friend ? " I said . Braced back in the lounge with a paperback book in her hand , Marian cried , " Why so glum ? Is n't it a gorgeousday  --  again ? Discussion is right . I think he 's been trying to convert me . " She lifted the book.  |p157I  put my bundle of mail and magazines on the ground and sat down in a wicker chair . Why so glum indeed . This was the best half hour of my day , this pause on the way back from the mailbox . On days when I found her gone , or Debby home from school , or somebody 's car in the parking area , I could count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone dropped in a water barrel . And just to see her there , fizzing , an open and inexhaustible bottle of champagne , did make it a gorgeous day in spite of Peck . " Converting you ? " I said . " That must have been fun . Has he got a mind ? Is anything going on under all that hair ? " " You would n't believe me if I said there was . " " No . I do n't believe you 're going to say so , either . " " It 's funny , I really do n't know , " she said , with the quick switch to earnestness that often made me regret having chosen a joking tone . " A lot of the time he 's absolutelypredictable , a sort of conditioned response  --  young anarchy  --  you know . He 's twenty-four , he says , but it 's a young twenty-four . And sometimes he just seems to be drifting in this cloud of abstract ideas and sometimes he 's literally reforming the world . He thinks you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a lot of enthusiasm  --  " she glanced at me under her eyelashes  --  " when he trusts you not to laugh . If he thinks you 're laughing at him , he gets stiff . Just now he was reading to me , sort of explaining where he starts from . " She held up the book again , and then dove into it , hunting through the pages with that bright , laughing , now-you-listen look of hers . When she found it and began to read , her voice was artificially high , like a child 's reciting.  | " The community of masses of human beings has produced an order of life in regulated channels which connects individuals in a technically functioning organization , but not inwardly from the historicity of their souls . . . . " " Historicity of their souls ? " I said . She frowned me down with her eyebrows while still smiling at me with her mouth . " The emptiness caused by dissatisfaction with mere achievement and the helplessness that results when the channels of relation break down have brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a loneliness that hides itself , that seeks relief in vain in the erotic or the irrational until it leads eventuallyto a deep comprehension of the importance of establishing communication between man and man . " She stopped . It seemed I was supposed to comment . I said , " From the quality of the prose it 's probably Kierkegaard , or maybe old Jaspers . " " Joe , you 're incredible ! It is Jaspers . " " So ? " I said . " One of the four cloudy gospels . Once I read them all , trying to understand something , but I never succeeded . Do you understand what the historicity of the soul is ? Or loneliness of soul , which is so much worse than ever before in man 's history ? Do you too take refuge in vain in the erotic and the irrational ? Are you too dissatisfied with mere achievement ? " The mere phrase made me start to roar . " Mere achievement ! Jesus . Well , you 've answered my question . There is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on litmus paper . " From the way she laughed , I knew she had thrownp159the passage at me just to hear me roar . ( I have it in front of me now , and it is as ponderously banal as ever . ) " The trouble with the people to whom that sounds profound , " I said , " is that they 're dissatisfied with mere achievement before they 're in the slightest danger of accomplishing any . Is Peck having trouble with his great book , is that why he 's getting sick of achievement ? " " Who told you ? " " Nobody told me . Is he ? " " You know , " Marian said , studying me with her head on one side , " if you were n't so irascible you 'd be very impressive . As a matter of fact , he 's given the book up . He says it was only a preliminary exercise anyway , to help clarify his consciousness . It was part of his withdrawnphase . Writing is a dead art . The future belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way it says here . " I should have felt justified , I suppose , since Peck seemed to be fulfilling my prophesies for him . But all I felt was my old weary exasperation  --  years old , much older than my acquaintance with Jim Peck . I said , " His recent sociability is philosophic , not accidental , is that it ? He 's given up contemplation ? Too much loneliness of soul there ? How 's he going to start the flow of communicationbetween man and man ? " " He 's going to organize a school , " Marian said . " Organize ? " " All right , improvise . He 's already started improvising . The last time John was back , before he went up to Alaska , he and Margo and that blond one , Peter Whatever-his-name-is , were over here all one evening asking him how to approach the foundations . " " That figures , " I said . " Let the Establishment fund thep160Disestablishment . I hope John was n't fool enough to help them . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of touched , they 're so earnest and naive . It has n't got a chance anyway . " " I wonder , " I said . " I 've known some foundation people . They 've all got projectitis . This could be just idiotic and far out enough to strike some board as interesting . What kind of school ? " She giggled . " Ca n't you imagine ? No courses , no admissionsrequirements , no administration , no degrees , no faculty . " " No faculty , " I said . " Now that 's getting right at the root of the evil . They 'll teach each other , is that it ? " " Of course . " " Under some bo tree . " " I suppose . In the country , anyway , outdoors as much as possible . There 's a lot of frontier , pioneering enthusiasmin Jim , did you ever realize ? He 's sort of like a homesteader , over there . " " Squatter , " I said . " What ? " " Squatter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . Anyway they 'll build their own meeting room and library , that 's all they 'd need . " I brooded for another while . Naturally I had read about this " free university " business . Naturally , since it was a contagion epidemic among his kind , Peck would think it a brilliantly original idea . He had no immunities , that boy . I said , " Except for the building and the bookshelves , I ca n't see but what they 've got their school already , right there across the creek . Professor Peck 's Outdoor Academy . "  |p161S|prawled  in the lounge as if she had thrown herself there and alighted anyhow , with legs doubled under and brown arms hanging down , she watched me with the impish expression of a child waiting for the firecracker to go off under auntie 's chair . " Did you look at his mailboxtoday ? " " I burned his daily trash . With my daily irritation . But I do n't think I noticed his box . Why ? " " You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Unimaginably Foolish Man ? Universal Federation of Morons ? " " University of the Free Mind , " Marian said , and burst out in giggles again . " You 've got it ! It 's in operation . It 's being presented to Ford and Rockefeller and Carnegie as a going concern , with ten students . Including Julie and Debby . " Her laughter was so infectious that I laughed too . I was always willing to laugh with her , even at myself . One on me . A going concern , Oh ha ha ha . We were sunk like minnows in the brown shade . John had been in the Pribilofs for ten days . Debby was away somewhere , perhaps riding with Julie . The Volkswagen bus had not been at the trail gate when I came down the hill . I could hear no sound from Peck 's camp , screened by thick trees and brush . Maybe they were all out stealingbooks for the library . I said a little grimly , " A going concern that just might go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Marian said . " Are you that out of sympathy with young idealism ? " " Young idealism has been making a mark out of me for six months . " " They 're just thoughtless . If you 'd unbend and get top162know them better you 'd probably like them . I like them . " " You like whate'er you look on . " She smiled , looking at me . " And you 're old Scrooge and hate the young . Why are you so hard on these kids ? " " Look , " I said . " Look ! " Without warning my hands were shaking and my tongue stumbled over words . " Look , I 've been through all this , I know it backward and forward , I could predict every insanity this fool will find his way to ! " As I said it , wishing that I was n't saying it , or that I could say it without that agitation in my voice , I understood that I had been wanting to say it for a long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half hopeful , I looked into her vivid face , which in instant sympathy had lost its laughter and shaded itself to my tone . I found there the understanding I had been fishing for , and behind it  --  or was that something my own shame put there ?  --  a sort of reserved judgment . I wondered if she sat there now listening to me with the same amused and scrupulous tolerance she showed Peck . But I did n't believe so ; her eyes were full of wry love . " Your son , " she said . " My son , yes . " " Ruth told me . " " What else did she tell you ? That I was a stiff-necked father and drove him to it ? " " No , because of course you were n't . Only that you were a lot alike , too much alike to get along , and that he never found anything he could be . " " And looked in all the wrong places , " I said . " Just like this one-eyed king of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had exposed myself , and irri/tated that in exposing myself I might have seemed to give too personal an explanation for my objections to Peck . I told myself that I would have found his beliefs and his activities dangerous nonsense if I had never had a son , or if my son had not wretchedly thrown away his life . " I gather Peck has a father too , " I said , " and blames every act of his own life on the old man . Papa was rigid , therefore all discipline must go . I wish he 'd come around and spill his insides to me , I 'd spray them with turpen-tine . " She had attractive , young , abrupt gestures , such as the one in which she now drew up her brown legs and pulled the denim skirt tight over her knees . " Do n't you suppose he knows that ? That 's why he avoids you . " " He avoided me before he ever met me , practically . The first day he rode in here he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock off . " Marian sat smiling at me speculatively . Every thought that crossed her mind showed in her face like cloud shadows crossing a meadow . She said , " Maybe that was only his way of knocking off the chip he thought you were wearing . " Maybe , " I said , offended . But she would not let me sulk . She leaned toward me and smiled me back to friendliness without losing her air of urgency and earnestness . " But that 's too bad ! Because you 're somebody who could teach him all kinds of things if you could ever get close . " " If he 'd let anybody teach him anything . You just admitted he avoids me . " " Yes , " she said , and sank back thoughtfully . " I guess I did . They all quote that bromide about not being ablep164to trust anybody over thirty . It might have to be someonecloser to his own age . " " Somebody such as you , evidently . " " All right , I 'm willing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it harder and harder to believe the world values them or has a place for them . " " That 's what comes of sneering at mere achievement . The world has a place for anybody who can do any-thing . " " Joe , " she said , " I think you want to keep your prejudiceagainst that groping boy . " " Groping ! " I said . " Good God , he 's the Mahatma , he 's got the confidence of a road agent . " " You think so ? If he really felt that way would he have to keep on acting so sure of himself ? I think he 's as uncertain as he can be  --  look how he hunts and hunts through all those yeasty philosophies for something to believe in . I do feel sorry for him . People his age have every right to be appalled at the world they find themselves in , the bomb and all the rest of it . " " Could Peck make a better world ? " I said . " As for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there on its thread . It 's no different from what 's always hung there . And if anybody ever pushes the button , it 'll be some nut like Peck , some wild-eyed enthusiast with no sense of history . It 's his temperament I do n't like  --  that True-Believerstance , and his faith in the emancipated individual . The whole history of mankind is social , not individual . We 've learned little by little to turn human energy into social order . Outside the Establishment these kids despise so much , an individual does n't exist , he has n't got any language , character , art , ideas , anything , that did n't come to him from society . The freep165individual is an untutored animal . Society even teaches him the patterns of his revolt . " 7It was the kind of tirade I sometimes threw at her head just for the pleasure of arguing with her . This time I thought I meant it , but I said it like a vehement joke because I was still upset . Marian , a chameleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilted eyes and said , " All right , maybe so . But if we 're still talking about Jim , at least give him credit for good will . He is n't going to push any button . He hates violence . And do n't you agree with him it 's terrible what the human race has sometimes organized itself for ? " " Yes , " I said . " Yes . We 've learned how to do it for technology and war , not for much else . What does he want to do , resign ? It 's just about the way it 's always been . I ca n't see anything different about the modem race except its technology . Whether that creates a **25;8280;TOOLONG of soul I would n't know . " " And you do n't think it can be improved . " " The technology ? It 's improving all the time . " " Come on , Joe Allston . The race . " The brown light was warm on her skin . It seemed to me that when the joking tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely provocative with one another , she was the one person in the world to whom I could say something I deeply felt . So I said , " You want to know what I think about the race ? " " Yes . " " It 'll be a mouthful . " " I 'm braced . " " All right , " I said . " I think the race will multiply , for it is unfortunately very fertile . Since marriage is one of the conventions the Pecks are busy breaking down , morep166and more children will be illegitimate or deprived of the dubious advantages of what we used to call a home . Because of that and other strains , more and more adults will be hoodlums , criminals , and the effectively dispossessed , and from these both our demagogues and our novelists will increasingly take their morals and their attitudes and their lingo . First we help create these underworlds , and then out of guilt and sympathy we imitate them . " " Oh , but wait a minute ! " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We imitate it out of pity , and we create it out of pity . Any civilizationthat achieves anything has losers  --  one of the reasons it achieves is that it has clear ways of telling its losers from its heroes . We have given up heroes  --  they go in for achievement . So we have more and more surviving losers , whom we imitate because we ca n't be ruthless enough to put them down . Are you still listening ? " " Not very quietly . " " I know . You 're pitiful . So am I. But I try to be pitiful and still keep my head clear . The law , including the moral law , is never either just or merciful . It 's just necessary . So the residual believers in order and stability and law and achievement will go on rigidifying the imperfectdiscipline of their society against the subversion of the criminal artists and the criminal saints . Are you attending ? " She nodded , an attentive , serious , half-smiling pupil . " Which are you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Peck used to think he was doing . But let me wind this up . We 'll go on synthesizing new proteins and carbohy/drates for the feeding of our growing billions . We will get very ingenious , but never fully successful , in disposingof the wastes we multiply . We 'll invent new weapons and new defenses against them , and new forms of political threat and blackmail  --  or no , those are alreadywell enough developed , in that area there 's nothingnew under the sun . Then one day we will succeed in doing what we 've been headed for ever since the first halfman in Leakey 's Gulch picked up a stick or a rock . Somebody will push the button , or one of our improvementswill backfire , and our technical tinkering will finally destroy all life , and ourselves with it . " She was shaking her head , her smile widening . " I do n't believe it . " " Wait , " I said . " Hear me out . Everything 's blasted , not so much as a virus left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Astronomical , cosmic  --  and then patientold Mother Nature will start over , assuming we 've left any nitrogen and other elements around , rolling her Sisyphus stone upward from the atom to the molecule to the polymer to the cell , and from the single cell to colonies of cells , and from colonies to forms with specializedorgans , and through millions of experimental forms until she stumbles on something that will work for the Higher Tinkering  --  in our case it was a brain and an opposable thumb , but something else might work as well . Then consciousness comes into the world again , and tools , inventions , languages , arts , symbolic systems , and history begins , and nations form , and science begins to add one law to another , and the conscious creature handles his environment always more roughly , and overcrowdsit too drastically , and things get competitivep168and hostile , and somebody pushes the button , and boom goes the stone to the bottom of the hill again . That 's what I think about the human race . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lounge , still thin , five months pregnant ( this would have been at the end of June ) , she looked as if she had swallowed a grapefruit . If she had not had that small perfect head , and those facial bones , and the great tilted eyes of such a sudden blue , she might have seemed almost grotesque , like one of those medieval Eves with a beautiful simpering face and a pot belly . Her hand lay on her abdomen now , as if protectively . " You surprise me , " she said . " You never heard me deliver a sermon before . " " No , seriously . Because we 're not so far apart as you seem to think , only you 're " gloomy about what you think , and I 'm not , and you think consciousness comes into the picture a lot later than I do . I think it may be there even in the atom , because the atom is the first sign we can detect of order . Is n't it funny , I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything . John and I sort of believe Teilhard de Chardin that all evolutionis only a perfecting of consciousness . Do you ? " " I have n't read him . " " And if consciousness is being gradually perfected , then the area of choice is being gradually enlarged , is n't it ? That 's why , if I believe in order , I have to believe in search too , even if it seems as silly as Jim Peck 's . The alternative 's petrifaction , is n't it ? Everything would just stop . So we have to risk disorder to keep the order of the universe expanding and consciousness growing . Does n't it thrill you to think that , an inch at a time , we may be creeping toward wider and wider consciousness ,  |p169until  eventually man may just sort of emerge out of the tunnel and be in the full open ? " " That 's what some of these modern kids think they 're doing with drugs . " " No , " Marian said . " I mean , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could n't be that easy . It has to be earned , to mean anything . It goes very very slowly , but we ca n't destroy the process any more than we can stay embedded in the sort of consciousness we have now , which we seem to have inherited from neolithic hunters . I think we 'll perfect ourselves , finally , not destroy our-selves . " " If it depended on people like you , " I said , " we would for sure . " " No , be serious . " " I was never more so . " " All right , if I could drop you a curtsy without getting up , I would . I 'm the kind that will save the world and justify mankind . But I gather you think there are too few of me . " " There 's only one of you . " Her head tipped back against the cushion , and she filled the grove with her laughter . " You 're such a courtly old Gloomy Gus . How can you be so courtly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or how can you blame Peck for feeling alienated and hunting for panaceas ? " I was glad enough to be back on Peck . Whenever we verged on biology and reproduction I got uncomfortably aware of Marian 's pregnancy , and of the mutilations under her checked boy 's shirt . She struck me as at once too devotedly bent upon that baby and too systematicallycheerful.  | " I guess it 's his stupid confidence that puts me off him most , " I said . " I hate people with confidence  --  it 's the surest sign of defective brains . Peck does n't know any better than to believe he can improve things . " " If he 's foolish you ought to feel sorry for him , " Marian said . " Do n't you feel sorry for me ? Because I 'm at least as hopeful of something better as he is . " " His kind of optimism I 've seen before , " I said . " Yours is something new , I 'll have to think about it . At least it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trouble with Peck , he does n't realize that the world he lives in is holding itself together in desperation , with sticking plaster and patching cement and Band-Aids , and needs the support of every member . He thinks he lives in a society of bigots , hostiles , fuddy-duddies , and squares who conspire to limit his freedom and his fun . I wish there was such a conspiracy , I 'd be its Brutus . " " That 's just what I was saying . You declare war on him , you wo n't give him time to work things out . " " I did n't declare any war . He declared a revolution , he and all the others like him . That ruthless and healthy society I was just talking about would tell them to shape up or take the consequences . Our society is afraid of them . But I see no reason to open the palace doors so they can loot the wine cellars and turn the art gallery into a latrine . Youth is barbarian , you ca n't let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , " she said , " but sometimes out of all its anarchy and groping it comes up with the idea that saves us . " " Maybe , " I said . " You 're speaking of a kind of youth I 've never seen . " She watched me with her head tilted , as if trying to make up her mind whether or not I was as conservative as I sounded . She began to smile . " But you still let Jim Peck live in your tree . " " Yes , curse it . " " Why ? " " Why ? Because you keep suggesting that I 'd be a flint-hearted monster not to  --  you and Ruth both . But also because I 'm the sort of half-wit who wo n't take his own side in an argument for fear of sounding illiberal . " We sat laughing at each other , the brief minute or two of seriousness dissolved and gone . I was always totally happy in her company , even when we argued and even when our subject was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced me close to things I had no intention of talking about , though I might hint them to get her sympathy . " I have one further question , " I said . " How can you stand to talk to him , now that summer 's come on ? " She squinted her eyes and wrinkled her nose in the mischievous-child smile . " Ah  --  outside he 's all right . He does a lot of exercise , after all , and he does n't have all the facilities for bathing . " " On the contrary , he 's got a plastic pipe hooked to my water line . " " Maybe he is n't aware . " " Come on , " I said . " You ca n't believe that . He 's just deliberately and calculatedly dirty . I was reading a book the other day that said something about the lairs of all carnivorous and omnivorous beasts being unseemly . One step in the progress you believe in has been to make human lairs a little less unseemly . But here 's old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unravel that littlep172knot of progress , and his lair is as unseemly as he can make it . I think he 's dedicated to the purpose of smellingworse than his daddy 's stockyards . It 's a mystery to me how those girls of his hang on , and why . " " He 's quite good-looking , " Marian said , " and he 's got a marvelous voice . " " I suppose . Nevertheless , I have trouble believing my eyes about his love life . The mind boggles . " " I wonder if he really has a love life ? Somehow he does n't seem quite the type . " " Take my word for it . He seeks relief  --  I hope in vain  --  in the erotic and the irrational , on his way to shedding his loneliness of soul and promoting communication betweenman and man , or man and woman . And the hard way , the hard way , against all probability . Next time you see him tell him I 've got a new motto for his ash-ram . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Bath and a Haircut . Good Is B.O. Plenty and Pussy Galore . " It set her giggling again . " Maybe I should have John suggest a man 's deodorant . " " Deodorant ? " I said . " Hell , he probably uses Accent . Let 's change the subject . When 's John coming home ? " " Pretty soon , a couple of weeks probably . " " Then he wo n't make the LoPrestis ' Fourth of July party . " " I doubt it . He should stay till he gets everything he went for . Then he 'll be home the rest of the summer . " " Good , " I said . " We 'll pick you up for the party . But we 'll be glad when he gets back . You should n't be left alone so much , especially with old Comus and his crew next door . "  |p173That  really did make her laugh . " Oh Lord , " she said , " what a limitless imagination ! I may be scared of a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm glad to hear it . I 'm also glad to see you lying down here , for a change . You do too much . How 's the baby coming ? " She patted her abdomen . " Coming right along . " " When 's B-day ? " " End of October . " " I 'll mark it on the calendar . " We remained smiling at one another , run-down , a little awkward . When I stood up Marian put her legs carefully over the side of the lounge and hoisted herself upright . She batted her brilliant eyes and smoothed the podded front of her denim skirt . Plaintively she said , " Never have a baby , Joe . You ca n't imagine what a chore viviparous reproduction is . " " Do n't kid me , " I said . " You want this baby very much . " " Yes , " she said happily , squinting at me in the sunspatteredshade . " Very very much ! " Friday night , July 3 Dear Marian , Maybe I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the more I think about our talk the other day , the more I feel inclined to write it . You thought I was pretty rough on Peck , and I have the impression you think I am suffering from some unhealed trauma about my son , Curtis , and am taking it out on Peck . It is n't impossible ,  |p174I  suppose  --  few things are . But as I told you , I have been through all this before . Since Curt died I have been over it ten thousand times . If I could convince myself I was to blame , do you think I would n't accept the guilt along with the grief ? Do you think I would deliberately repeathistory with this Peck boy , who reminds me so much of Curt ? I can find plenty of things to blame in my temperament and my actions , but I ca n't find the specific things that caused Curt . I ca n't find adequate causes for somebody like Peck , I weigh his beliefs against mine and I ca n't conclude that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it is my moral duty  --  which I 'm not exactly performing  --  to resist him . It would embarrass me to say to your face some of the things I expect to write down here . I was never one for the couch , I do n't unburden readily . If my consciencevisits me in the night I assume it wants to be alone with me . To repeat our dialogues seems to me too often a sort of self-justification . But I will try to repeat them to you with as little of that as I can manage . One of my difficulties in Curt 's case was that every time I acted according to my principles I was instantly at war with him . Every time I swallowed my principles , or let Ruth persuade me to be indulgent , I felt ashamed . So far as I can tell , I have not changed since Curt died , which does n't mean I do n't still have bad times over his memory and am not full of regrets . But my trouble is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a guilt that I ca n't justify . If I had it to do over again , I ca n't see how I would have done it differently . I am probably the last one to say what Curt really was , since I never understood what he thought he was trying to be , and was never sure he was trying to bep175anything . Maybe he was trying not to be anything . He was crosswise in the channel of his life for thirtysevenyears -- he was born crosswise . I am not modern man at all , but he was modern youth to the seventh power . He never got over being modern youth . He was crypto-communist youth during the late thirties , **30;8307;TOOLONG in the forties , and overage beat youth in the fifties , and nothing very seriously , and nothing for keeps . As I look back at him , I see that he was n't much of anything , he was simply against . I have read his life , and arranged for its publication , two dozen times : rebel in uniform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his age group . He was willful child , sullen boy , prep-school delinquent , army reject , postwar lush . Whose fault ? It is usual for distressed parents to accept the blame our psychologists are eager to hand them , and I think Ruth and I would accept it if our judgment told us we must . Sometimes we did accept it , against our better judgment , and tried to cope with him by dealing with ourselves . But appeasement never worked , and no matter how many ways I tried to persuade him of my concern and my affection , I never found his guard down , and my patience was never long enough to outbox him . Put that down as one thing I accept blame for : impatience . Maybe you can make an explanation from it . I ca n't . It explains a little , but by no means all . Many of our friends probably explained him with that glib formula about sons with high-powered fathers , doing me the honor of thinking me more high-powered than I am . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have felt some secret shame that I was only a nursemaid of writers and not a writer myself . Thep176apartment was always full of them , he grew up among celebrities , and he could have made comparisons . But that should have led him to treat me with contempt or condescension , perhaps with pity . Not with hatred . Principles , I said a minute ago . Values  --  a very unfashionableword , since to hold any you have to deny the validity of their contraries , and thus seem censorious . I honestly believe that the counsel I gave Curt was mainly sound , and I do n't think too much of it was holier-than-thou . After all , we lived in the world , not in a parsonage . I tried to give him a code to live by . He wanted not one scrap of it , he did n't agree with a single value I held . I had got my values from wherever we do get them , out of the air or out of books or out of contact with people I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way except that he was immune to mine . Mine , say , were old-fashioned bacterial values . His were viral , and from my point of view virulent . He went absolutely unerringly to attitudes that he knew I disapproved or despised , and the only way to live with him in peace would have been to submit to his beliefs . Ruth was more willing than I was  --  after all he was her only child , and she loved him  --  but she liked the way he was going no better than I did . I would not submit to his beliefs . I believed , and I still believe , that some periods of human history and some phases of human culture are better than others , and that it is n't always the creeping toward perfection that I know you want to believe in . Some codes are better than the codes that displace them ; and I believe this is a corrupt age because it accepts everything as equal to everything else , and because it values indulgencemore than restraint . I guess I honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in austere virtue , and the other had bread and circuses , like ourselves . There is a book of Ford Madox Ford 's , one of that fat tetralogy , that he called with characteristic ungrace Some Do Not . He was adenoidal , and they say he smelled like Jim Peck , but he had something . Some do not , if only to show that they can refrain . You do n't have to shoot yourself like a Dostoevski intellectual to assert the will . You do n't have to commit whimsical existential crimes to prove your freedom . You can take hold of yourself , like training a horse , and that is both pleasure and morality . I never persuaded Curtis . I was neither a good enough teacher nor a good enough example . Train yourself for what ? he would ask . To sell bonds ? To be a good corporationman ? To demonstrate shaving between the halves of televised football games ? To make a lot of money ? To contribute to this vulgarian 's nightmare they call a civilization ? To acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God help me , to roar . To be a man . Is n't that enough ? To be a man whose word is trusted and whose generosity can be depended on and who does n't demand something without giving something himself . Fair trade , he would answer me . Inviolability of contract . The morals of the stock exchange , which never cheats a customer but which goes up on every brushfirewar and skyrockets on every big one . What should one do ? If Ruth had had any better luck with him I would have thought that he simply had to attach himself to antifatherly gods until he proved himself a man in his own terms . Ruth was infallibly gentle with him , though tartness is more her natural style . Shep178did n't push him , she followed him clear to the bottom of his burrow , trying to understand , she forgave him incessantly , she was the pacifying force when he and I clashed . And he went out of his way to treat her with even greater impatience and contempt than he treated me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commonest sources of our quarrels . Sometimes I wondered if he did n't abuse her because she tended to take his side  --  he wanted no mediator between us . It does me no good to reflect that filial rebellion is common . Mutual respect , though perhaps not common , is possible  --  I 've seen it . It becomes impossible only when the value systems of the two antagonists are irreconcilable , as they seem to be between Fran LoPresti , who is conventional , and her daughter , who is hell-bent not to be . Curtis could have disagreed with us incessantly if we had felt in him some integrity that gave his disagreementweight . We could n't . I have to blame myself for not finding any way of reaching him , but I ca n't feel that either Ruth or I had anything much to do with his corruption . The twentieth century corrupted him , the America that he despised corrupted him , industrial civilizationcorrupted him with the very vices he thought he scorned in it . It encouraged him to hunt out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the vulgar , and to call these things freedom , and put them above the Roman virtue that , so help me , is the only moral stance I can fully admire . And like Peck , be always had smoke screens , political or aesthetic , to hide his hypocrisy from others and perhaps from himself . He was drunken , disorderly , and promiscuous from early adolescence . We might have thought those irregu/larities normal and exploratory if he had shown even temporary contrition about them ; but he indulged them as if he must , to maintain his self-respect . Non serviam . All right , we could have taken that too , if we had found any fallen-angel grandeur of mind or spirit in him . But we had to observe that he was ungenerous , that he gave nothing and took all he could , that he felt responsibility for nothing , love for no one . He had such a gift for the wrong companions that it was fair to think of him , not them , as the bad influence . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good mind that he used for nothing but searching out new forms of challenge and insubordination , new kicks , new ways to evade obligation . He sponged on people , especially women ; he betrayed friends , especially women ; and he fell for every crackbrainedgroupy arty-intellectual fad over a period of twenty years . In his earlier teens he had a political phase , walked picket lines , attended meetings of the Young Communist League , collected money for the Spanish Loyalists . Fine . For a while , though he alarmed us , we were even rather proud : he showed signs at least of a compassionate social conscience . Actually , he had no more political interestthan a snowshoe rabbit and no more economics than a grasshopper . He liked secrecy and rebellion and dusty basement meeting places , and emancipated girls in lisle stockings , and the sound of broken-down mimeographmachines cranking out insurrection and intransigence . When the war came on , he was swept naturally into pacifism  --  his canoe was already on those waters , he did n't even have to paddle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , he liked to imply that he wasp180thrown out for his pacifist beliefs , and it is true that he was one of a group that in 1941 marched in tin hats and gas masks , bearing scornful placards , outside the classroomwindows of a master who was hot for war against Hitler . But Curt was n't thrown out for his conscientious beliefs , and he was thrown out more than once . One school sent him home because he had been scraped up drunk off the lawn three weekends in a row , and was insolent to the masters who reprimanded him . The secondfired him because he and two other boys smuggled a girl into the dorm and kept her there for three days . A master coming to remonstrate mildly about the pacifistpicket line found her there , locked in the bedroom with a lot of girly magazines , a bag of caramels , and a bottle of sloe gin . For a few months in 1944 Curt was in the army , but he came out quickly with a PN discharge  --  homosexuality . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw you out on those grounds unless you go out of your way to be challenging in your aberrations . I do n't think for a minute that Curt was a fairy . He wanted out of the army and he had no more self-respect than to get out that way . It is a painful chronicle , and I gain nothing but reneweddistress by writing it down . There were two cheap marriages and two cheap divorces . There was a banjo-picking phase and a barefoot-saint phase . He rode a motorcycle across the continent , he tried Zen and poetry , the Village and Sausalito . I found him jobs and he lost them or quit them within weeks or months . Once he worked quite happily for half a year as a mechanic in a garage ( was it dirty enough to suit him , or did he find some queer heartbreaking security in the un/taxing performance of a simple skill ? ) . That ended in a traffic accident and a drunk-driving fine . Mainly he lived on us and on the little trust fund that Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him before she died . It gave him just enough to leave him free . You asked me if I did n't believe in freedom and I told you I did n't , not much . Freedom was the worst thing that could have happened to Curtis . Once in a while , after he had passed his twenties and could no longer pretend that he was just postponing his life until he could " come to grips with reality " and " find himself "  --  my God the cant that apologists for these lost souls use !  --  he made half-meant , convulsive efforts to do or learn or be something . These fits came on him when , because he was ill or broke or at odds with some woman , he came back to the apartment for a spell of fatted calf . During those spasms he would be brisk and energetic ; we heard him sing in the shower ; he wore coat and tie when he went out on important errands . Heartbreaking , because we knew it was a false front , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a son with whom we could get along . False starts , he made a dozen . Once he signed up for a writing course in Washington Square  --  did you ever notice how pitifully these people are converted into believersby the word " creative " ?  --  but he found the instructortedious and retired to somebody 's cottage up in the Housatonic valley to write on his own . He and his guests wrecked the place and cost us a friend . Once he was going to study architecture  --  this when he was past thirty  --  and talked his way into a job as a draftsman on the strength of his facility at free sketching . Two weeks that lasted ; he said he could n't stand drawing otherp182people 's lines . One year he spent a lot of time in the Village , painting he said , and taking some extension class or other . That too faded away . There was a long and relatively peaceful year when he was abroad , living in an unheated room on the Nyhavn in Copenhagen , a place he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toughest of Europe 's waterfronts . Yet I wonder . I had a Danish phase myself , I went back there too , looking for something and not finding it . I wonder if Curt was trying to follow some raveling thread back through his labyrinth ? It saddens me to think so , for I 'm sure it broke , he ended up lost in the same old mazes . Every time he failed to perform , or lost his job , or lost interest , he fell back into the Village or wherever he happened to alight . Right back into his old galvanictwitchlife . His personal motives were freedom and pleasure , and he misread them both . Then a little less than three years ago , thirty-seven years old , with not quite a prep-school education but with a record of scorn for practically everything the human race ever thought worthy , he had another of those painful spasms of the refurbished will . Because his aptitude scores were high and friends of mine would still write letters for him , he got himself admitted to San Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did . After all , we were penitent , we were clearly not good for him and never had been . Any college recklessenough to admit him had our gratitude , any move he made that looked serious stirred our hope . In September he drove across with a friend . Contrary to custom , and promptly enough to encourage us , we had a letter . The school was O.K. , better than he had expected . Freshman classes were infantile , but he hadp183goofed off so long he had something coming . He thought he could take an overload and go to summer school and so crowd the degree into three years . He had an apartmentover a garage , pleasant and quiet . The weather was as advertised , the beach marvelous . The big thing around there was surfing : decrepit as he was , he was giving it a try . Mother would probably raise a cheer on hearing he had shaved off his beard  --  it had n't seemed quite appropriate on the beach . He exaggerated our concern with trivial stigmata . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have applauded a beard as long as Rip Van Winkle 's if I could have been sure that Curt was finally , after so much disastrous selfwaste , going to pull himself together into a package , even if the package turned out to be a Southern CaliforniaNatural Man . There were no more letters . In November a friend , asked to look him up , reported that Curtis had dropped school and given up his apartment . After some detectivework , he had found him living in a trailer colony near the beach , with a girl and a surfboard . Our informantsaid it was not a very attractive colony , more a motorcycle bohemia than a surfer 's camp : plenty of black leather , greasy jeans , long hair , late parties , and raids by the narcotics squad hunting backyard and window-sill weeds . Well , so the more he changed the more he was the same thing . We swallowed the news without real surprise . If he was indeed a custard pie , he was not going to stay nailed to any wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though we had given up on him several times before , and though one night Ruth , reading a magazine article about surfing , looked up at me andp184said , " You know , surfing sounds like fun . And it is n't only kicks , it 's a cult . You have to have real skill and nerve . " Yes , I said , so I had heard . " It ought to be a healthy life , had n't it ? " she said . " Healthier than that zoo down in the Village , anyway ? " " Ah , Ruthie , " I said . " Ruthie , Ruthie , Ruthie ! " But I had had the same sneaking thought myself . At least there was nothing false or contemptible about surfing , even if it did n't seem quite the highest end to which a man might devote himself . That would have been about Christmas time . In Februarywe had a call from the La Jolla police . Curtis was dead , drowned in a surfing accident , his body recovered . Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay with her sister in Bucks County and flew out to bring Curt back . I saw his girl  --  a trifle , a tanned gewgaw , string-haired , ready to be defiant if I gave her a bad time . But why should I give her a bad time ? She cried , saying he was the greatest guy she ever knew , he was n't satisfied with anything but the very best out of life ; and looking at me out of her wet slightly crossed eyes she whispered , " Sometimes I wonder if he really slipped and got hit . Sometimes I wonder if he did n't let go . He was capable of it . " I had wondered the same myself , but I did n't feel like joining in her speculations . When I left her she probablywent off with one of the other great guys who lived in the clutter of trailers , campers , and converted delivery trucks scattered along that scabby little ravine . Or maybe she stayed on in Curt 's , which I sold on the spot to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did n't show me Curtis there . I saw him onlyp185back in Bucks County , at the funeral . It seemed I looked through a scald of tears at the total failure of his life and mine . I thought he had a manly face . Without the beard he had worn ever since beards emerged as part of the uniform of alienation , he reminded me of the bronze charioteer in Delphi . The beach life had been good for him . He looked fit and young , and his brown hair was streaked . Sun or peroxide ? Inescapable as it was , the question shamed me . After all , he was thirtysevenyears old . I still ca n't think of his face composed on the final satin without a clutch in my chest . The hair might have been as false an emblem as the beard had been , but the face had given up all its poses and looked merely young , incredibly young , far younger than it had any right to look , the very face of kicks-crazy America , unlined by thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrupulous dissoluteness , untouched by life  --  or by death either  --  except for a slight discontented droop at the corners of the lips . I could not answer the suggestion of resentment and dissatisfaction in it . Maybe , if the girl 's suspicion had any basis , he had sidled into death as he had taken up every job and project of his life , and then found that he could n't quit it as he had quit everything else . Somehow Ruth and I had always had some groundless faith that he would come around . The boy having trouble becoming a man would eventually , perhaps late but eventually , overcome his trouble . These oats would be sown , he would get over having to sniff at every post where some existential junky or disengaged beat or criminal saint had lifted his leg . There would come a time when he would n't have to snarl at his gentle hu/morous mother , and when he and I might talk , go to a ballgame , have a drink , discuss a book , without that miserable stiff-legged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admittingit to each other , we had counted on time , and now time was run out . Never never never never never . If Lear was an old fool , and he was , he was by the end a contrite and suffering fool . So was I , for I could not put aside the thought that perhaps , out in those glassy rollers inside the violet band of the kelp beds , Curt had looked it all in the face , himself in the face , and let go the board . There had been no wounds or signs of injury on his body . Most suicides , I believe , are spiteful . If Curt was really a suicide , did he go hating , or did he go hopeless ? Either way , it meant he could n't bear any more . Neither , thinking about it , could I.Sometime after the funeral , the girl  --  there was somethinghuman and touching about her little act of responsibility  --  senton a box of Curt 's personal effects , including his books . I could have listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerouac , Sartre , Genet , the Marquis de Sade , Ginsberg , Burroughs  --  a poison garland from the Grove . I could not have told you then , and I ca n't tell you now , whether those books really corruptedhim . I think they only corroborated him , withoutquite giving him the confidence of his convictions . That ends Curt 's story . I think I must go on a little with my own . I felt that I had to be steady for Ruth 's sake , and for a while I seemed to be . But in the end she bore it better than I , for no amount of thinking could reconcile me to the way our only son had died , irresponsiblyand frivolously , incongruously uniting in himself a sun-worshiper and a nauseast ; and if unhappy ,  |p187as  he surely was , unhappy by his own asserted will . I judged him , yes I did , even in death and even while I was stricken with the sense of his unhappiness , and I judged myself for judging him , and could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a dull sad endless time for us both . I was n't sleeping , but when Ruth tried giving me sleeping pills I made a virtue of an old prejudice against tranquilizers . Probably I was punishing myself . I have already admitted that I believe in guilt , not as an indulgence but as an essential cautery of the soul . One of my troubles was that I felt guilty without being able to persuade myself intellectually that I could have acted any other way . So I ground the coals to my breast in my private dark . I had exiled myself to Curt 's old room on the excuse that I did n't want to keep Ruth awake , but what I really wanted was Curt 's ghost to myself . It was the worst time of my life . Night after night I went on composing dialogues , revising his life and mine , explaining away estrangement with reasons that I did not fully believe , being wiser in these fictions than I had ever been in fact , putting into clear prose this clash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , all that . I said persuasively everything that at one time or other I had said angrily or hopelessly . And every time , I disgusted myself with my own mouthings , I never persuadedmyself that I would have persuaded him . I felt that I could n't leave even his ghost alone to be itself as it wanted to be . Why ? Because I could n't accept him , livingor dead , as he had wanted to be . I wanted reconciliation , oh yes , but on my terms , because I could n't convince myself that my terms were wrong . I definedp188myself as bigot without shaking my convictions at all . Within weeks his living face had begun to fade into a few waxwork expressions : an impish boy ( what ever happened to him , where did he go ? ) caught in motion while he played with a terrier on a wide New Hampshirelawn ; a sandaled beat who leaned his head against a wall and raised his unclean reddish beard in contemplation ; the athlete whose composed handsome discontentedface burned upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the fading or frozen expressions that hid my son 's unreachable privacy I tried to speak my heart , and I had the advantage of endless revisions ; but the dead listened no more than the living had . He would have none of my love unless it came unqualified and uncritical and in spite of every provocation  --  and it is simply uncanny how much of that spirit I detect in Jim Peck , who is n't of course after my love , but who is certainly trying to corner me without losing any of his own men . It is not a kind of love I am ever likely to be able to give . I do n't think any human being is entitled to it , and anyway I ca n't separate love and respect . Curt demanded what I could n't give , I insisted on what he would n't accept . Never never never never never . Trying to explain myself , I told him about my own life , including some shameful episodes , but all that did was revive a lot of unhappinesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and remind me of old guilts that were not unlike Curt 's . Thinking filled my days with boredom and my nights with self-loathing . Out of my son 's death I plucked the conviction of my own imperfectionand failure , and yet I could not name the ways I might have taken so as not to fail.  |p189There  were times in the office when , faced by some contractual quibble or other , I was drowned in disgust ; times when dictating a letter I heard my voice like a twittering of sparrows . By the end of March , Ruth was saying to me , " Joe , you 've got to take a vacation . You 've got to get away for a while . " I could easily enough have justified a trip to Rome or London or Paris . But I would have run into clients in any of those glamorous capitals on any afternoon . I found too that I did n't want any two-week interim followed by a return to the office . I wanted to wipe the board off clean , not with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did it every Friday afternoon in Northfield , Minnesota , when my mother was keeping house for a professor at Saint Olaf College and I was briefly a Danish kid , possessed of an unexpected identity between the Swedes who snooted the Norwegians and the Norwegians who scorned the Swedes . A blackboard as clean as Miss Tidemann 's fifth-grade room on a Fridayafternoon , a mind emptied of all that could not now be helped , a full retreat of the soul . Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita Mi ritrovai per una selva oscura .. . Nel mezzo ? Quasi alla fine . I was more than sixty , past the age when I should have had to settle ultimate questions . But ultimate questions were the only kind I wanted to ask , such questions as might divert my attentionfrom Curtis , who was past hurt or help , and onto myself , who felt ambiguously but bitterly responsible . It may have been only Ruth 's insistence on a trip that got me to believing the cure for my unease might lie in a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had spentp190my life in motion even while I persuaded myself I was domesticated . A housebroke vagrant . Call me Ishmael , but add , Jenny kissed me . I had an alley cat 's appreciation of stability without having a place either of origin or of domicile . We had camped in Manhattan for thirtysevenyears , with at least one trip abroad during each of the thirty-seven . When I began to wonder if it might be possible to go back and find where the road forked ( Che la diritta via era smarrita ! ) , I could n't think where I might go . If I had had a home town , I would have gone straight back to it on one of those middle-aged pilgrimages to search out the boy I was , the man I started out to be , and I might have half expected to find myself barefootedand with a fishpole , like a Post cover by Norman Rockwell . Young America , freckled and healthy , the finest crop grown in the soil of democratic institutions . But I had been raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my father , shot himself in the barn , and whose second , a drunken railroad man with D.T. 's and periodic paralysis , was finally backed over by a switch engine in the Saint Paul yards . After he died , when I was six , we moved from place to place . My mother , with a thick Danish accent and no education beyond her twelfth year , had no skill to sell , and no beauty , only her hard hands . She kept other people 's house and tended other people 's children . We lived in shallow , laborious , temporary ruts , and over their rims she was always seeing some dawn or rainbow , the kind of rainbow that had brought her to the States , only now it was one that always promised something better for me . Generally she waited until the school term was over , and then we were gone to wherep191a letter or a rumor or a chance conversation over coffee had persuaded her she must go  --  another town , another house , another job , strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be learned . Sometimes I have felt that I could smell my way backward down my life from stranger 's house to stranger 's house , like a homingdog , by little tokens left on maple or elm or light pole . I would know one place by the smell of crushed mulberries , another by the reek of trying lard , still anotherby the dampness of laundry hung on a clotheshorseunder which I lay hidden and heard the surf of adult voices overhead . There is no plan or continuity or permanence . My first sixteen years of going to and fro in the earth were a passage from vacuum to vacuum . My teachers thought me gifted ; eventually I found my way to a scholarship and a part-time job at the Universityof Illinois  --  it really is a land of opportunity and there really is such a thing as disinterested human kindness . Or the intention of kindness , for like many good intentions , the help of my high-school principal had mixed results . I was exploded into books and ideas and the company of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boardinghouse life that they might have been another species . I was in a constant tremble like an overfilled glass . I discovered that I was bright , and it made me drunk to realize it . And it never occurred to me , though I had worked summers since I was twelve , that instead of blotting up teachers ' attention and devouring books I might be out earning some money to make my mother 's life easier . When we 're young , we take so casually every sacrifice offered by the old . At least I did . Also I know that if it had occurred to me she would never have permitted it for one hour.  |p192She  would have thought even a year , even a semester , a catastrophic wasting of my talents , though I was only sixteen and could have spared it easily . I had been a child unnaturally self-contained , I had had to learn early to be seen and not heard . I had hidden myself in corners and window seats and backyards and sheds with books or projects of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid 's child would be suffered , and sometimes sentimentally made over , but not indulged . When college blew up all those inhibitions , I must have been insufferable , the sort of cub who would now set my teeth on edge . Anyone who did not accept the opinions that I had developed within the hour , or read in a book ten minutes ago , or advanced in argumentbecause the argument obviously called for them , was an idiot , and apart from thee and me there were a lot of idiots in the world . You know me  --  I have not substantiallychanged . Among other things , I remember resolvingthat I would live without emotion . I had some hot debates in which I disparaged poetry because it was irrational and therefore unreliable . An emotion , I said , was an imperfect thought . I would live in the thin pure air of reason . ( Ashes on my head  --  I was preposterous . Yet I was recognizably the ancestor of the intemperate old fool you know . ) My mother could find no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After coming down with me from Elgin , where we had been living , she warmed herself for a day among buildings , stadium , lawns full of students and squirrels , and then she went away again , probably out of pure delicacy because she could see she embarrassed me , and got a job in a boardinghouse in Chicago.  |p193I  saw her go with relief . Later I hid her letters from my roommate , because I was ashamed of their lined tablet paper and their penciled , misspelled , mixed Danish and English . Though I thought I loved her , and told myself that I would rescue her and bring her to my mansion as soon as I finished college and had set my life on the track to some star , I would not for all the praise I hoped to win and all the money I expected to make have had it known that my mother was a maid of all work in a rooming house , a servant to clerks and shopgirls . Not too many of her letters had to be read in haste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first college year , going down cellar to stoke the furnace , she caught her heel in a rotten step and fell . My only visit back to Chicago was to her funeral . Luckless and deprived , she lies in a South Side cemeteryin an unvisited grave , a clumsy Danish servant girl without one relative besides myself on the American continent . She had married , supported , and buried two weak husbands , and thereafter given herself up to making a life for her son . It all reads like one great cliche . But maybe love and sorrow are always cliches , ambition and selfishness and regret are cliches , death is a cliche . It 's only the literary , hot for novelty , who fear cliche , and I am no longer of that tribe . I had n't thought of my mother ten times in twenty years , but in the bad time after Curt 's death she came every night to join the spirit of my dead son . Between them they drowned my heart and mind , for I had to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life until I met Ruth , against my own unwillingness to acceptor forgive Curt . Would she have judged me , nop194matter how selfish and demoralized I might have become ? Would she , in my place , have been able to reconcileherself to a scapegrace and give him the uncritical love that I was half convinced he had been demanding of me ? And if she had , would I have approved ? Down in my heart , would n't I have thought her sentimental , and abused her for the love I knew I had not earned ? My two ghosts kept Ruth from getting close to me , and they made me sick for what I had done to people I loved , and what they had done to me . If I forgave Curt , I had to forgive myself . And there were the talents I had got from the great Grab Bag  --  I had failed to make anything of them , but I could n't determine whom or what I had failed , for I could n't refer myself to any source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gene pool , or anything else to which the wastage of my life could be called a loss . I grew to hate the thin dispersalof my relatives , my mother in Chicago earth and my son in Bucks County , each alone among strangers . And here was I , random and now childless , making meaningless orbits in the Madison Avenue void . Lose a dog in the woods , no matter how oscura , and he will follow the back track to the place where he went in . At past sixty , rather deep in the woods , I was lifting my nose from among the mold and mushrooms to sniff at any cold scent that promised to lead me somewhere . But I could find no place that was mine . The crisscrossingtrails of my mother 's life had confused all the scents . In the end , we made , one after the other , the two moves that are possible to Americans and lost dogs . We smelled our way back to the old country and sniffed for a while around Copenhagen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where myp195mother was born . We learned something , perhaps , but that is another story . What matters is that I did n't smell one thing that was familiar or that meant anything personal ; not a person , not an echo , not a whiff from the past . Europe was cut off , no longer anything to me . So we did the other thing that Americans and lost dogs can do , we quit trying to backtrack and went forward . We turned our backs on everything remembered and came out to make a new beginning in California . It was n't a radical act , in a way . It was a habitual one , it conformed to twenty generations of American experience . We would have pooh-poohed the idea that we were living by the Garden myth , but we were , we are . We expected to become less culpable by becoming more withdrawn . We shook dust from our garments and combed bewilderment like twigs from our hair and we abandoned the woods . I am determined not to fight shadows any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blame . I would n't be surprised if Peck and I were unanimous on the subject of harmlessness , at least in theory . I do n't want to harm anybody , I do n't want anybody harming me . So you see why this Peck exasperates me ? He reminds me of things I do n't want to remember . He threatens me , he endangers my peace . If he and Curtis are the future , then I am an irreconcilable past . They leave me nothing , not even the comfort of blindness , because I think I see them very clearly  --  as clearly as I see my own incapacityto accept them or deal with them . And , of course , ca n't dismiss them either , any more than I can make up my mind to shoo Peek out of my oak tree . Well , I have been writing you for two hours , tryingp196to say a little more intelligibly some things I said too uncompromisingly the other day . I have come at you like an old weepy barfly , and cornered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told you the story of my sad life . I am a continual surprise to myself : I had not thought I was one to spill my guts in this fashion . Usually I am nimbler at ironies and evasive tactics than at the confessional business . Except to me , none of this that I 've written you is in any way important . But it is personal and it is serious , two things I have always found it troubling to be . This letter I found recently under a stack of old papers in the study . I had never finished it , signed it , or sent it . But it reminds me that even back in midsummer Marian had begun to force or coax me out of the burrow where I lived with the gophers and the moles and the other creatures of darkness . If Peck was a threat to peace , what was she ?  |p197ONE  KIND OF midsummer day here starts gray , with a cool sweat of dew on the leaves , a smell of wetted oat grass , dark wetness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sky is obscured by the unmoving unmottled ceiling of high fog that will burn away about ten . Once it does , the rest of the day will be warm and even until the evening chill comes on . But two or three times in a summer we will get up to find the morning cloudless but milky , with a red sun and a vinegarish taint of smog even up here in the hills . The valley is murked out , the near ridges are dim , the far ones gone . If there is any wind , it is a light drift from the inland valleys . The newspapers will speak of inversions , and record a climbing smog count , until , after three or four days of increasing heat and smartingeyes , the built-in air conditioner that lies off the Pacific shore will move inland and hang over the skylinein rolls of cottony fog , blowing us instantly cool again . The Fourth of July was one of the red-dawn days . When I got up at seven and went out on the terrace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The air was sour and still . Between the cinderish bricks of the patio the screeds were warping upward at thep198ends . Thinking how that brick lawn would radiate heat later , I had a disloyal moment of yearning for the cool grass and broad-leafed shade of rainier climates . Catarrh had left nothing on the mat . He was not a summer hunter . The first year he had eaten a lot of lizards , but they obviously disagreed with him and he had given them up . He was too lazy to hunt widely , and once he had cleaned out the vermin from the immediateyard in the spring , he relapsed into apathetic snoozing in the flower beds and scavenging the occasionalbird that broke its neck against the windows . I was congratulating myself that at least , now the adobe had dried like cement , Catarrh 's spring exterminationwould last . Then I walked around the house and discovered that within the past twenty-four hours a gopher had come boring straight under the walk , leavingcollapsing bricks in his wake , and was already throwing up mounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me swear out loud . They 're infallible , they find your weakness like heat-seeking missiles . The walk was my only remaining weakness , for within half a year of completing the patio itself , all laid on sand and with sand swept between the bricks as the landscape plan specified , I had discovered that the systemwas not made for gopher country , in which it got undermined , or for adobe soil , which in the dry season cracked so wide that all the sand went down to China and the bricks caved after it . I had already taken out the entire patio  --  nine thousand bricks , a brick at a time  --  and relaid it section by section on a concrete pad . But I had n't yet got around to the walk . Presto , this pest finds it . It is not easy to trap gophers in the loose earth of ap199flower bed . The usual result is that they kick your trap full of dirt and pack the hole so tight you ca n't pull it out . But I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to deal with him after breakfast . So I went inside and plugged in the percolator and made toast and orange juice and grilled a couple of little breakfast steaks and carried the tray into the bedroom , where Ruth was just stretching herself awake . For a woman who rather scorns physical indulgence she takes a suspicious pleasure in the last luxurious half hour of morning sleep . We breakfasted in the bedroomas usual , with Catarrh curled up on the electric blanket , and after breakfast we read aloud in Il Gattopardofor nearly an hour . Ruth insists on these exercises , lest we deteriorate . Only after the Italian lesson did I get out and start for the rose garden with a spadingfork and a couple of traps . By then it was already hot . You can tell a gopher 's general direction by the way the lateral mounds lie . Dig across the line of these and you cut his main tunnel . This is the only effective place to set traps , one facing each way . His instinct is to plug up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backing over the trap dragging dirt under him with his forepaws , he backs his behind into the pan and is speared just behind the forelegs by the sharp wire jaws . The mounds here ran irregularly toward the corner of the house . As I dropped the tines of the fork to the ground , estimating the angle , I was indulging in a fantasy , thinking how it would be for some ambitious gopher , digging along by that radar or sonar they seemed to possess no less than porpoises , if he ranp200into the solid gunnited wall of a swimming pool . Aha , he would say to himself , they 're protecting something really precious here . Look how solid , observe how immovable , see how deep . They value this , whatever it is , but they ca n't keep it from me . Claws that dig in adobe will never be blunted by cement . Away he digs into the concrete , his full length , twice his length , and pauses for a breather and goes at it again . By his sonar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his claws becomes damp , then wet , and he thinks , Yea , by God , I 'm almost there . I 'll bet it 's a freshly watered flower bed full of roots , or maybe a cold frame of tomatoes , my favorite . And whulp comes the whole swimmingpool into his face . Oh happy culmination . Oh well-deserved denouement . But this one I would have to get the hard way . I stepped down on the fork and sank it full length and pried upward . It came up heavy and struggling . The dirt broke away and left a knot of black and white coils that clenched around the tines . Right out of the earth in one motion , when I had expected only clods and hopefullythe dark opening of the tunnel , came this king snake that had lain secretly under my feet . His writhings sent shudders up the fork handle into my hands . Standing there holding the struggling thing , I was cold goose flesh all over . Horrible . But beautiful too , dusty black crossed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiplike body . And wounded , speared through , blood on the bold coils . Above all , ambiguous , a creature marked with extreme visibility that had been struck because he was underground where his visibility did n't help him . No hawk wouldp201ever have stooped on this one as the redtail last spring had stooped on the gopher snake . The black-and-white whip would have warned him off : too hot to handle . So I stoop on him , myself as blind as a mole , and he never sees his death blow . I slammed him to the ground and scraped him off the fork , and he gathered his broken body , thickened at the middle with the unmistakable bulge of the swallowedgopher , and faced me with diamond eyes and flickering tongue . But I gave him no moment for defiance . I beat him to bloody twitching with the fork , and at once enlarged the hole out of which I had speared him , and buried him . I reacted as if to an enemy , or to evil itself . Yet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rattlesnakes , all the pests hurtfulto me and my garden . Though he worked in darkness and shook my pulse with his suddenness , he had been doing me a favor when I killed him . Queasy and upset , sweating with heat and shock , I stepped out of the trampled flower bed with the spooked feeling that the snake was an omen or symbol whose meaning I ought to catch but could n't . Now , I would read him as a riddling revelation of the inadvertent harm we all do , as if our very clothes were deadly , as if harm rose not only from malice , hatred , love , and the other focused passions , but from the most casual contact and the most commonplace act . Step out to watch a sunset and crush a bug  --  that sort of thing . But that is now . Then , I was sickened and bothered . A day that had not started well anyway was already spoiled . Well , absit omen . I went into the kitchen and poured myself a gin and tonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth , who lost her temper with me for drinking at midmorning on a day when I would probablyblot up ten highballs at the LoPresti party . Think of my liver . So I sat on the terrace the rest of the morning thinking of my liver and listening to the noise of firecrackers from the eastward , over in subdivision country . Every municipality in California forbids private fireworks , but still I was hearing the shotgun boom of big ones and the musketry rattle of strings of little ones every few minutes . Every time one went off , the beagles in their pen right under my eye rushed back and forth with their saber tails in the air , and put their paws against the wire and stretched their muzzles upward . Owooooo . Owooooo . " Would n't you think one of those half-witted Welds would get it through his head those damned hounds are a nuisance ? " I said . Ruth lifted her face out of a magazine . Our fuss about the morning drink had been sharper than usual , and we had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing shorts , though I have suggested plenty of times that shorts are for women under fifty . I took these not as a concession to the heat , but as a deliberate challenge to me . " I do n't know , " she said . " Why do n't you call them up and tell them ? " " Tell them ! " I said . " You know the answer I 'd get . " She shrugged , ever so indifferent . " Why do n't you just sit quiet and console yourself by thinking how if his place catches fire this Fourth of July you 'll let it burn ? "  | " You should read minds , " I said . " How are you at tea leaves ? " For a half minute she looked at me , pursing her lips . Then she said , " Tea . That 's not a bad idea , " and smiled  --  having dug me good , she could smile again quite naturally  --  and went inside . After a time she came out with a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peace offering , but I chose to read it as her way of telling me what I was permitted to drink before five o'clock . I took it from her and set it on the bricks besidemy chair , and it sat there till lunch time , with its ice melting to scum and wasps drowning in it . Around noon the pick of hoofs went down our road : Julie going to work for Marian or to visit her kooky friends in the treetops . In my shade it was still and sticky hot . The ugly clutter of pigeon house and dog run on the opposite hill offended my eyes . Every few minutes boom went the sullen air , and ow0000 said the hounds . Standing on the railing with the binoculars , and looking down to the county road , I saw that Tom Weld had run up a flag before his house . Oh , say can you see . Lou LoPresti could not have picked a worse day for his potlatch if he had consulted an astrologer . At three o'clock I awoke from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motionless and water-saturated as the bottom of a pond . My skin was greasy , my head stuffed . I could taste smog at the back of my tongue . The windows , closed and curtained to keep out thep204heat , also kept out any possibility of a breeze . But outsidethere was no more breeze than in the bedroom , and the smog taint was worse . The sun had moved around to curl the oak and toyon leaves motionless below the terracerail . The wooded ravines lay simmering in air as gray as dishwater . The beagles sprawled in their doghouse , and the patriots had run out of ammunition , but our flag was still there . Warte nur , said the ghost of Goethe to my discontentedmind , balde ruhest du auch . On the patio side I found Ruth , barefooted and in shorts , walking the narrow shade picking dead blossomsoff the geraniums . Between her and the bank of pyracantha the bricks blazed , colorless with heat . Straightening to look at me , she accidentally put her foot down outside the line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquent . A fakir used to hot coals would have found that patio up to specifications . " A great little day for the barbecue , " I said . Without answering , she bent again and went on pickingwithered blossoms into the garden cart . It seemed that reconciliation was up to me ; evidently that untouchedtea offering had made her mad . Well , I had not calculated to alienate her permanently  --  the only way to live with a woman is in amity . So I unrolled the hose from the reel and turned on the water , which at first came out hot enough to shave in , and then ran cool . Under it the bricks steamed : when I turned the hose away I could see the wet disappearing in them like the fog of breath evaporating off a windowpane . I took off my shoes and sprayed my feet and ankles . Delicious . I was absorbed . Then , watching my chance , I caught Ruth when she was bent over the geraniump205bed , and turned the hose full on her stretched backside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Oh , damn you ! " I said , " It would be in strings anyway , in this steam bath . Want some more ? " " No , that 's enough ! Now quit it ! " I made her dance , popping water at her feet , and when she turned I gave her another good one on the bottom to suggest that shorts deserved no quarter  --  ladies over sixty would be safe only if properly dressed . Then to forestall reprisals , I turned the hose up in the air and let it rain on me until my shirt and pants were soaked . The humidity was so high that even soaking wet I was warm . " Turn on the fountain , " Ruth said . " At least we can sound cool . " I went into the garage and turned the switch ; the motor hummed in its box . By the time I was back in the patio the jet was toppling into the steel basin above the pool , and shortly the basin began to overflow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of grottoes . A couple of times we walked from the shade , across the warm wet bricks , and with the sun beating on us stood mid-calf-deep in the pool to let our blood cool at the ankles . We were standing there , wet and reasonably comfortable , when Marian came up around the buttonhook turn at the top of the hill . Across the fence I watched her stop briefly to rest . Her hair was tied back in a pony tail like Debby 's , her dress was one of those maternity wrap-around things , indefinitely expandable and guaranteed not to look well at any size . Its shade of green did n't particularly suit her . I thought she looked tired , a stick woman withp206a bead for a head and a larger bead for a belly , and not even her smile , flashing like a heliograph when she saw me watching her , could remove the impression of fatigue and drabness . Walking slowly , she came up the drive and around the end of the pool , and in comic collapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandaled feet sprawled before her , she puffed out a great breath . " I ought to have auxiliary oxygen for that hill . " " You ought to have your head examined , " I said . " Why did you walk up ? I was going to come by for you . " The unbecoming green dress made her brown hair look dull ; there were shadows under her eyes darker than the summer tan . As if to see whether or not I was really annoyed at her , she looked at me out of the corners of her eyes . " I 'll get my breath in a minute . I know , you said you 'd come by , but I got . . . I do n't know , Debby went off with Julie to swim at the Casements ' , and I felt sort of smothered down there alone , as if I 'd been popped into a double boiler . So I came on up . " Ruth was staring at her with the absolutely expressionlessexpression she wears when she is concentrating on something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Why , of course ! " Marian said . Her eyes jumped to Ruth 's , then to mine . Something trembled on her mouth , a begging flicker of the lips gone so fast it might never have been there , and she was saying serenely , making a show of relaxing deeply into the chair , " Just as soon as I get my breath . " " You sure picked a lovely day for a walk . " She stirred , I saw her argumentativeness reviving likep207a game , exhausted puppy at whom somebody has made a playful pass . " I do n't know , " she said . " I sort of like the heat . " " You 're sun-struck , " I said . " Here , take off your san-dals . " " Why ? " She looked suspiciously at us both , apparentlyseeing us clearly for the first time . " You 're both soaking . What have you been doing , falling in the pool ? " " Making a sane response to the weather . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all . She jerked them back , then stretched them out again , pullingher dress above her brown knees . " O000 , dreamy ! It 's like Keats eating red pepper and then drinking cool wine . " The first of the bolts-and-jolts boys , " I said . " Anybodyin his right mind would skip the pepper . " The haggard look which Marian had worn when she arrived was smoothing out , almost as if it had been only the effect of the heat and the hill . I looked for the scared or distressed or begging expression I thought I had caught earlier , and all I saw was her usual amused combativeness . She said to me , " Pain is a form of pleasure , do n't you know that ? " " You mean when it quits . " " No , pain itself . " " Only for sadists and masochists , " I said . " For thee and me , pleasure extends only to the near edge of the uncomfortable . " Considering , she had already begun to shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you like it to be real hot old summer , and when it 's winter do n't you like to freeze ? Pain makes things valuable . How wouldp208women feel if having babies was as easy as picking apples ? Do n't you get pleasure  --  satisfaction  --  no , pleasureit really is  --  out of all the rough , hot , cold , scratchy , hard , uncomfortable things ? " " No . " Oh you do too ! " " No I do n't either . And I do n't think John would want you taking all that pleasure running up hills in a heat wave . You looked ready to collapse when you came in here just now . " " Really , Marian , he 's right , " Ruth said . She had a way of seeming to consult some core of seriousness inside her even while she was engaged in one of these joking arguments , the way a girl laughing at something might in the merest flash out of the corner of her eye check her hair in a mirror she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees so that the outline of her thighs showed through . She seemed momentarily astonished to find her lap so foreshortened . Then she lifted her clear blue insistent glance and said , " I was as comfortable as could be down below , and that did n't keep me from being low and lonesome and wishingJohn was home . So I came up to see you , and now I feel better . That 's what John would want me to do . He wants me to do the things that are good for my spirit . Do you know that poem of Frost 's ? " " Of course . Which one ? " She made a completely happy face . " All right . I do n't remember its title . I only remember the last lines . It 's about hard pleasures . " Primly , ready to laugh , but serious too , meaning it , laughing not at the poem but at the spectacle of herself sitting there spouting it , and meaning too that we oughtp209to be open to poetry as to everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verses in somebody 's patio  --  now listen , her bright face said , while embarrassment and amusement and enthusiasm threatened to swamp her , listen now : " When stiff and sore and scarred I take away my handFrom leaning on it hardIn grass and sand , " The hurt is not enough : I long for weight and strength To feel the earth as rough To all my length . " Saying it brought her forward in her chair . Five minutes after she arrived on our hilltop breathless and tightmouthedwith exhaustion  --  and with that knowledge that she carried in her , too  --  here she came at us . Live ! Suffer ! Enjoy ! Wake up ! In that body , for sure , the spirit was master of the flesh . She cried happily , " I ran across that just the other day . It says exactly what I 've felt all my life . " " I believe it , " I said . " I believe it completely . But Marian , let me tell you , after sixty the capillaries do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're talking to a pair of torpid old souls who ca n't do anything on a hot day but sit in the shade and bicker . " " Yes , and squirt each other with water like a pair of six-year-olds . " ( How does one describe a smile like hers ? Good teeth , white and even . Large eyes , very blue , uptilted at the outer corners . Face thin and fine boned . Skin brown andp210stretched , with a sheen on it . The physical details say nothing , and they do not recall the essential magic of her smile to me now . It was her spirit that smiled , it bubbled out of her like the bright water bubbling from the fountain . Remembering , I could knock my forehead on the ground . ) Her fine small head , shaped by the back-drawn hair , tilted to listen . Her eyes went around the patio in a flickering circuit . " And look what sort of shade you arrange to bicker in ! " Forced by her attention , we attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen and smell and taste . The motor hummed , almost imperceptible , from its box . The stem of water rising five or six inches above the nozzle wavered and toppled with clunking , gurgling sounds . I saw that the jet was trying , against the interferenceof its own toppling weight , to rotate clockwise , like all volatile Northern Hemisphere things pulled by the spinning earth . Now and again the basin hummed out a deep reverberating note , like a gong . From its lip a smooth thin stream curved to shatter in the pool , and from the splash circles spread , overtaking each other , rocking the single yellow water lily afloat on its green raft , and from the spreading circles the sun knocked reflections that fluttered on the fence and crept among tongue-shaped clematis leaves . A hummingbird buzzed the orange tree by the pool 's corner and shot away . " You would n't have made this so beautiful if it did n't please you , " Marian said , " and it would n't please you so much if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had this spring , the very first day we ever came up here ? Flow I got after you for not leavingeverything natural ? Well , that 's the way I 'd still dop211it myself , but yours is so good it almost persuades me . What 's an oasis without a desert around it ? What 's a garden if you do n't come into it from a dirty street or a closed-in house ? You need it hot in this patio . You would n't turn on that fountain in the rain . " Her vividness troubled the air as the blur of the returning hummingbird troubled the corner by the orange tree . I sat smiling , dabbling a stream of water on her sandals , and as she threw out her hands in a triumphant Q.E.D. sort of gesture I saw the slight , awkwardstiffness of her left arm . A cold finger was laid on my insides . I could not help appraising the false breast swelling above the real swelling of her pregnancy . I saw her brown throat , too vulnerable . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been maimed and threatened ? Was it to herself or her danger that I responded with so much anxious solicitude ? Talk about the need for contrast in a garden ! She was herself , if one believed her thesis , the indispensable reminder of danger and pain to make this sanctuary blessed . She saw stars by daylight because she lived down a well , and she watched them with passion because any day the cover might go on and she might be bottled forever in the dark . For that single intense instant the image of the king snake glared in my mind , the bloody coils bulging in the middle as Marian bulged . I saw him smashed and twitching , stuffed into a hole with the dirt falling on him . It was no more than an association of shapes , but the cold spot in my guts contracted in a spasm , and on my arms every little hair bristled from its crater of goose flesh . I was dismayed at the violence of my feelings , andp212said angrily  --  but angry at what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bravery , I suppose  --  " Pain is fine when you can turn it off . It may even be good for the soul in small quantities , the way strychnine in small quantities is good for sick hearts . But they do n't arrange pain in this world so you can turn it off when you want . Feel the earth rough to all your length , sure , fine , but for God 's sake do n't cultivate pain . Pain is poison , you poor demented enthusiast with whom I am madly in love . Pain is poison ! Do n't go hunting for it . Never praise it . Avoid it all you can and bear it if you must , but never never never mistake it for something de-sirable ! " It was an outburst , and it left them both staring . In my embarrassment at the way my feelings had snatched and shaken me , I squirted their feet with care and turned off the hose . Ruth 's half-dried shirt was stuck against her , showing the wiry outline of her torso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and durable woman . But the flesh of her thighs sagged a little , her hair was pure white , and looked all the whiter because her eyebrows were still black . I felt a gush of tenderness , not so much because she had been my wife and my intimate for forty years , as because she was mortal and threatened like the girl beside her . They read me the same lesson in helpless vulnerability . Neither could have had the slightest notion how hard it was for me not to reach out and touch them , one after the other  --  groping for contact like a hippo or a walrus , one of a species that can not live without rubbing against its fellows . I met Marian 's eyes . She smiled tentatively , willing at a hint to forget this awkward moment and go back top213the playful heckling that was our minds ' habitual disguise . I thought she might understand what my anger had been trying to say ; after the long letter I had written her the day before I somehow felt that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , and I had to remind myself that she had never seen the letter ; I had poured myself out without an audience , I had fallen in the forest without an ear to hear my crash . Now , I saw , Marian would have tried to say something cheerful if she had been sure what I meant or what I needed . But to cheer me just then she would have had to annul her mortality , Ruth 's , my own , the mortality of every blob that twitched with sensation anywhere on the indifferent earth , and fled the too violent sensations it knew as pain . What a job of work was done when we crossed the fatal boundary between the polymer and the cell , and began stumbling toward the perfected consciousness that Marian was so sure we would ultimately reach ! The telephone rang , and I went with relief to answer it . It was Fran LoPresti , apparently without a thing to do but chat , though she had a hundred-odd guests comingat any time . She is dreadful to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quicksand . Unctuous and caressing , full of soft emphasis and boneless stress , she went on about the heat , and who was coming and who could n't come , and what ought to be done to keep Ansel Sutton sober . The telephone was wet in my hand , a fly kept lighting on my bald spot , the voice oozed on until mercifully some little plug of lead melted in my overheated skull and a connection shorted out and communicationbecame only a soothing murmur.  |p214I  could n't imagine what she had called for . Anybody in his right mind would be sitting in a cool tub . Maybe that was where she was . I saw her , pink and white , sitting in the bathtub stirring the water with a pink toe , her mouth smootching the white telephone . From that , for some reason , I progressed to a vision of pink new-born mice being lifted by their tails and dipped into honey and lifted out dripping and smoothly swallowed . It struck me that the murmuring had stopped . " Mmmmm ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 've been working like fiends . Every one of the mural things and all the driftwoods , and even the big one , the welded one . I finished it last night , out there with the perspiration simply pouring off my nose and bugs flying into the torch . You just do n't have any idea how I suffer for my art . " All art is suffering , " I said . " Well , " she cried , " I hope not for you ! I 'm very anxious to hear what you think of them , especially the welded one . " I said I could n't wait to see them . The receiver crooned and sighed and warbled at my ear . " And , oh , Joe , " it said . " I knew there was something else I wanted to ask you . Have you seen Marian ? Julie said she had to baby-sit , but I 've rung and rung , and nobody 's home . " " Marian 's here with us . She said Julie and Debby have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She sounded softly jolted , as if she had stepped down a step that was n't there . " She is with Debby , then . "  | " That 's what Marian said . " " Well , all right then , " Fran said vaguely , and then her voice rose a little and lost its syrup , and I found myself speculating that in a crisis she could probably even scream . " I would have bet she was down with that gang of beatniks again . Do you know , I found out she goes there all the time . And she lies to me , my God how that child lies ! It 's the most awful age , I ca n't do anything right , I ca n't open my mouth without making her hate me . And that gang makes her ten times worse . Who owns that land across from you , Joe ? Could n't we find out , and see if we could n't get them put out of there ? " " God help us , I own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But why ever did you . . . ? " " I gave permission to one , and he became seven or eight by mitosis or something . " " But you do n't want them down there . " " Not particularly . " " Oh , good , " she said . " Oh , wonderful ! Maybe we can do something . I 'm sure they should n't be permitted in the neighborhood , they 're as vicious as can be , and dirty , and all those long-haired bearded boys . Ugh ! Oh , you make me feel so much better ! Let 's talk about it  --  not at the party , I want you to have a good time and I want you to look at my sculpture very carefully . Later , right away soon . Mmmm ? Oopsie , there 's a car , they 're starting to arrive . Byeee . Come early . Bye-eee . " I want back out to the patio . " Who was so endless ? " Ruth asked . " Fran . Mainly worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Immediately I wished I had n't said it , for Marian was dismayed . " Oh dear ! Is she upset ? "  | " Well , yes . She 'd like me to run them all out . " " Are you going to ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " The fact that Fran is upset seems to me the least good of several good reasons why I might . " " Oh , I 'm going to have to talk to her , and to Julie too . Maybe I should n't hire Julie any more . " " Then she 'll go anyway , as you told me yourself , " I said . " Well , the hell with the surly young . I read some counselor the other day who was convinced the only thing worse than being a parent is being a child . He had it backward . Are we going to this party ? " " I suppose any time now , " Ruth said . " Sun 's far enough over the yardarm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she only looked at me pleasantly and impenetrably . I suppose she did think it was now a legitimate time for a drink . She has these little rules , and when they are satisfied , she is . And I suspect that she had comprehended my outburst when Marian began trying to persuade us , or herself , that there is virtue in pain . " Are we going across country ? " Ruth said . " Let 's not , let 's drive around . " Marian looked at us both and said , " Honestly , if you two can stand it , I 'd rather walk . " " Of course we can stand it , but you ca n't , " Ruth said . " Just because I got winded on your hill ! " Marian said . She seemed genuinely upset . " I ought to walk , the doctorsays so . Anyway , do n't I have to be consistent and choose the uncomfortable way ? " Softly , I said to myself . Do n't argue with her . For some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up tight like the first day we met . So I said , asp217if it did n't matter , " O.K. Have you got some sort of wrap , for coming home after it 's cooled off ? " " I 'll take an extra stole , " Ruth said . A light trembling , not quite a smile , moved on Marian 's lips . " Joe , are you mad ? Because I do n't really care . Just because I 'm a pig and like punishment is no reason . . . " I agree with John , " I said . " You have to do the things that are good for your spirit . " " I 'm afraid you are mad . " " Not at you . At it , whatever it is . I 've been mad at one thing or another all day . So just stick your feet in the water and stay cool and we 'll get dressed . " A little later we were a tiny procession between brass earth and brass sky , little coolies in straw garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was so hot I shivered , and flares went off behind my eyes . My nostrils were coated with the dust-and-manure smell of the trail we followed , and I felt the tug of burrs at my cuffs , the prick of foxtails in my ankles . High over the hazed ridges the redtail was riding the thermals , looking not as if he were up there hunting , but as if he had gone up in search of a breeze . Beyond the Shields pasture and the hot lane , a shortcutpath hooked down into the willows around a pump house and tank . There was a head-clearing whiff of witch hazel , an illusory breath of coolness . Sidling through the turnstile , we passed the empty chicken house whose torn wire was a memorial to Weld 's brother 's dog , and climbed the gradual lane of oaks , almost defoliated by oak-moth caterpillars and clotted with dark mistletoe . Naturally , being a parasite , the mistletoe was unpalatable to any pest . The more rav/aged the tree , the more healthy those kissing-clusters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the party as volubly unintelligible as an Italian traffic argument , and then we came to the top and it was spread out before us in the enormous patio . A Renoir picnic on a construction site . Among randompiles of lumber and sand and tile , between cement mixer and bench saw and sawhorses , women in bright dresses and men in bright shirts coasted and clustered . There were only three little fig trees for shade , but a red beach umbrella bloomed like a poppy in the blazing center . The shadow of the western wing of the house cut the patio about a third of the way , and against the shaded wall , by a white bar table , a man in a white coat dispensed respite and nepenthe . As he lifted a glass to pass it to a woman , the ice cubes caught the sun and threw me a brilliant blue wink . Marian turned . Her smile for the moment was as bright as the wink of the ice cubes , but as we started in toward the crowd I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the desolated trees . Her shoulders drooped , her green dress was wrinkled in back where she had sat on it . However much I might want a cold drink with a touch of company , she looked as if someone should in kindness lead her off to a darkenedroom and put her to bed . The other day , between rains , Ruth and I waded through the mud to the LoPresti place , carrying a little Christmas present with the notion of patching up ourp219relations , sadly out of whack since the Fourth of July . We found no one at home but the sculptures , on whom I suppose I might have put some of the blame for Fran 's sense of grievance . And the whole vast patio in which they sat or stood or hung had been tiled , bordered , grouted , polished , planted , cleaned up , finished . Cement mixer , bench saw , generator and tank and torch , piles of sand and tile , were all gone . And not a muddy footprintbesides our own , no sign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners had been stirred by anything bigger than an earwig , nothing busy about the place except a stream of ants that poured up and down the grout lines between the tiles . I got , somehow , the feeling of a bleak and tidy desolation ; the aim had gone out of that once-busy yard , it was like an unhappy woman with a tight mouth . And for that I was partly responsible . They say that more people are alive today than have lived in all previous human history . I find that hard to believe . It is so long a history , and so laborious , and it sits so heavy on the mind . Alive for what ? I wanted to ask , up to my ankles in ants that I could have melted to goo with one blast of an insect bomb . Busy for what ? But I knew well enough . We move because we move , we build because we build , we reproduce because our loins thirst for the profound touch , and then we divert upon our children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hopes that for ourselves are no longer mentionable without a grimace . Standing in Lucio 's courtyard before Fran 's ill-omened sculpture , I had a quick , comical impulse to get out of there and go home and do something useful  --  lay some stones , say , in the retaining wall I was building along the drive.  |p220This  job was too aridly closed up , and there was no sign of a new beginning . Yet Lucio had walked a treadmillof incessant new beginnings . The cement mixer , his heraldic emblem , was always rampant somewhere above a cone of spilled sand . Lumber piles and litter got incorporated into the living routines as people use the stumps and outcrops of a picnic site . I have seen Fran in her abstracted way flatten down the top of a two-ton pile of sand and throw a cloth over it and use it as a coffee table , and it was standard practice for Lucio , on party days , to fill the cement mixer with ice for the cooling of beer . Even worn-out tools never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those that generatesits own acetylene gas out of calcium carbide and water , Fran welded them into art . We were looking her major creation right in the eye , or would have been if it had had an eye , and I found myself actively disliking the thing . Troublemaker , pretender , parody of something sad and unattractive  --  in its maker ? in its viewer ? both , probably  --  it brooded back at us , its exposed torso shiny with welds like scars . Most of Fran 's art was either ragged messes of junk ( she talked a good deal about learning to think in the medium ) or mosaics of old teaspoons , safety pins , coins , and kinks of copper wire embedded in fused glass like the leavings of litterbugs in a Yellowstone hot spring . But this thing was frankly , even darkly , female . Back on the Fourth I had indulged my alcoholic humor at her expense , but now I thought she leered at me with a knowledge that was sinister , sad , and accusing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wore for skirt a cut-off galvanized boiler with rivets running like a rowp221of buttons from belt to hem . Rising out of the rounding top of this skirt like a jutting pelvis was an old shovel whose handle made a spinal column linking pelvis and thorax , as in a wired skeleton . Midway in the spine , moved by some whimsy that I never did understand , but that I would investigate if I were her psychiatrist , Fran had drilled a hole in which she had set a lens from a pair of eyeglasses . For some reason , it was inescapablyobscene to look right through that thing 's bifocal navel . Filthy X-rays . Bracketed to the spine in place of a rib cage was a portable typewriter rescued from the dump . Its movableparts were fused with rust , its keyboard made a panel of gangrenous guts , its necklace of rusty type hung down between ribbon spools like round rudimentarybreasts . To enhance the resemblance , Fran , thinkingin anything but the medium , had touched each spool with a bright nipple of solder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neck of one of those African women stretched with circle after circle of copper wire . The face was composed only of the hammer 's down-hooking claws . Curving up over this tooth-face as halo or sunbonnet was a bamboo lawn rake with some broken rays . Both hammer and rake were tilted slightly on the stiffly uprightbody , so that the faceless teeth under the sunbonnetwore an indescribable look of coquetry . You expectedher to sidle up and say in a voice like Mortimer Snerd 's , " How 'd you like to look through my navel , a-huh , a-huh , a-huh ? " " What in hell do you suppose Fran had in mind ? " I said , when we had stood looking for three or four min/utes . " She could n't have arrived at that thing by accident . And she takes it seriously or I would n't have hurt her feelings so on the Fourth . " " She 's a pretty vague woman . I imagine it 's just an iron doodle that turned out gruesome . " " You know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie . " " Julie , or Fran 's feelings about Julie ? " " Well , is n't every portrait a self-portrait ? " " Fran would n't like the idea , " Ruth said . Then she said a strange , bitter thing . " If you did a portrait of Curtis , would it resemble you ? " We stared at one another almost with hatred . Her eyes ducked away , her lips moved in a deprecatory slight smile , as if she begged me to take her remark as a joke , and she went back to studying the caricature standing above us on its pedestal . " Is n't it just that hammerthat makes you think it 's hostile ? " she said . " After all , she did n't make that , she just found it lying around . " I found it easiest to adopt her casual and speculative tone . " If she 'd been making it out of affection she 'd have found something else lying around to use , a saucepanwith dimples , maybe . And why those white-hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or those half-formed breasts that are like the scary outcrops on your adolescent child ? And all those corrupt guts , and that window navel . Does n't that say , in the voice of a furious and suspicious mother , I can see right through you ? ' " " You 're free-associating , " Ruth said mildly . " After all , she started this a long time before . " " Then it was prophecy . " " Oh , I do n't know , " Ruth said almost impatiently.  | " She was n't afraid of Julie as a girl . She was afraid she 'd grow up beat , or a lady vet like Annie Williamson . She wanted a nice sweet feminine domestic girl in nicely pressed dresses who would be on the honor roll and play the piano and make little art things . " " But virginal . " " Oh yes . Maybe a little Pre-Raphaelite in a nice wty . " " And got this stormy creature she could neither understandnor approve . " " Yes . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . " " Yes . " " Like a lot of other parents , " I said . It was the point we had been circling for minutes , as her oblique look acknowledged . " Why do n't you say all parents ? " " Because I do n't believe it , " I said . " There has to be an occasional parent-child relationship that works . When it does n't work , one side or the other is to blame . " " And you think it 's usually the child . " " I did n't say that . I did n't even imply it . If I implied anything , it 's that people are too ready to assume that it 's the parent . " A drift of wind moved in the empty , chilly patio . The air was soggy with unshed rain . The expanse of tiles gleamed like an abandoned Roman bath . It would have made a splendid place to open your veins . I said , " Did you read about that fifteen-year-old who killed his parents the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrecked it so they had his learner 's license pulled ? So that night he went into theirp224room and brained them both with an ax . Who 's to blame in that one ? " " A boy like that is obviously a psychopath . " " And therefore all the more in need of control , is n't he ? They were doing the only possible thing when they grounded him . But there are millions of people who will sympathize with that murderous slob . He was frustrated in his normal desires . All his friends had cars . His society taught him to equate the driver 's license with the passage into manhood . And anyway we must feel sorry for wrongdoers , they 're unhappy people . Well the hell with it ! I 'm going to save my sympathy for that tormented pair trying to instill a sense of human responsibilityinto their brat , and getting their brains knocked out for their pains . " " Oh , well , Julie did n't murder Fran and Lucio , after all . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Becauseher mother would n't let her do everything her hormones and her teen-age rebellions suggested . Fran is a kind of fool , sure , but the kid is a monster . And do n't tell me consequences caught up with her . They caught up with a lot of other people too . " " She is n't that bad , " Ruth said , " and she may be one of the kind that never learns except by making mis-takes . " " So youth must be served , " I said . " They must be left free to work out their lives . You know what youth is ? Youth is a pack of barbarians . That 's why I 've resigned from the God-damned world , because it 's abdicated its authority , it 's abject before these underaged goons that think they know everything and know nothing at all , not one damned thing ! "  |p225Ruth  's lips were pursed , her eyebrows arched , rueful and dubious . I was aware of the sound of my voice dying out between the blank wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand came out and patted my forearmquickly , twice . " Yes , " she said on an indrawn breath like a sigh , and then , " It 's going to rain , we 'd better get back . I wish they 'd been home , it might have smoothed things out some if Lou could have shown off his finished patio . " She stooped and laid our little offering between the screen and the massive homemade plank door . I have seen that thoughtful , relinquishing , regretful expression on people as they lay flowers on a grave . We had honestlyliked the LoPrestis . It seemed to me , as I know it seemed to Ruth , that we would be better employed consolingone another than avoiding one another . " I 'll bet you something , " I said . " I 'll bet you he liked it a hundred times better when it was a corporation yard as rough as a lava field , full of tools and people and noise . " Which is the way it was when we looked into it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood a minuteunder the last tree , two hundred feet from the bar . It was like looking in toward home plate from center field , with the crowd overflowing out of the stands into the infield . People saw us , heads turned , teeth glinted , hands waved . A police car with its radio turned on squawked out something from where it was parked off the corner of the eastern wing , and I thought perhapsp226we already had trouble until I saw the city manager of a town up the line , standing under the red umbrella with a big-time subdivider and builder , keeping his ear to the air , evidently combining pleasure with a proper Independence Day alertness . I saw Bill and Sue Casement , both brown with summer golf , and our resident All-American and his porcelain wife , who were by the bar with our resident dictator , the man in the white coat I had mistaken for a bartender . I should have known better . Lucio 's parties ran on a do-it-yourself basis . Beyond the white coat I noted two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictator 's . Strangers , and sticking together like nuns . Also I saw Annie Williamson , our lady vet , hunt-clubber , raiser of beagles and borzois and Tennessee walkers , judge at all the region horse shows and dog shows and gymkhanas , a woman with the wrists of a laborer , the shoulders of a bantamweight fighter , and a voice like the Hewgag of E Clampus Vitus . Likewise college professors , gentleman-farmers , honest-to-god farmers ( not Torn Weld , never Tom Weld in that patio , though he was represented by his Labrador'sby-blow ) , retired generals , airline pilots , advertisingmen , the widow of an internationally famous oil geologist , the wife ( in the midst of divorce proceedings ) of an internationally famous architect , a Nobel Prize winner in medicine , and others unknown , a great swarm to the number I should say of three thousand six hundred and thirty-two , not counting the little children , who were all still up at the Casement pool . Now here came Fran across the blazing patio to greet us . We waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her exposing her susceptible skin , but she came on anyway , and we met by the cement mixer , which stood about where the shortstop would be playing with a man on first and a right-hander up . She was looking most Gretchen in a dirndl , and she had her fair hair in one thick braid that hung over her shoulder nearly to her waist . IIer arms and neck were soft , white , palely freckled ; her eyes were brown and moist like her cocker 's ; her voice reached out like her hands to lay a caressing touch on us . For company she always put on what Ruth called her haut blancmange manner : you had the feeling that if a fly alighted on her it would sink and disappear without trace . And yet a warm sort of woman , almost tediously female , as affectionate as she was affected . She came lamenting the heat and hoping we were not simply dying of it , and she gave me a soft look of gratitude when I draped one of my stoles over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she took it as a thoughtful acknowledgment of her actinic peril . " Oh , I 'm just sick about this weather ! " she cried . " I wanted to have a really nice show , and now nobody can stand out in the sun long enough to look at things . " I began badly . Turning to the cement mixer , fuming from its maw of ice , I said , " Ah , but this is one I 've been admiring . No  --  do n't tell me what it means . Or is n't it intended to mean anything ? Do I have to think in the medium ? " " You come here with me , you scoundrel , " Fran said , and hooked her arm in mine . " There 's one over here I do want your opinion of . " " I ought to get these ladies into the shade . " " Just on your way past , it wo n't take a minute . I want them to see it too . "  |p228As  we picked our way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shade cried Hi and Welcome , and My God , did you walk ? You poor souls . What 's all the cold-weather gear , Joe ? Man , you out of your mind ? Hello , Ruth . Hello , Marian . Where 's your handsome husband ? Still off with those lady seals ? We stopped before the figure in the skirt of tubular iron and I looked her in the teeth . I looked her through the navel . I inspected her rusted viscera . I observed the little flames of the nipples . Though we were under the red umbrella , it was almost as hot as in the open sun . I could see Marian wilting , I myself was oozing sweat , and it made me impatient to be trapped into a lot of dishonest art criticism the minute we arrived . I wanted my hand around a sweating glass , what is more . But with my forked tongue I said , " This is a real departure . This is something new . " " What do you think ? " Fran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me honestly , now . " " It 's different from anything of yours I 've seen . " " Yes , I think I . . . " " You did n't just throw it together , either , " I said . " This was created . It will stand a lot of looking . " " You just look all you want to ! " " It 's ominous , though , " I said . " Is it meant to be a little frightening ? Because that 's the way it strikes me . " " Well , yes , I guess it is meant to be a little frightening . It sort of took hold of me as I worked on it .... " I saw Lucio coming , his dark face shining with heat , his shirt mooned . Fran was saying happily , " And if you do n't think that was a perfect stinker to weld , with that old torch ! I ought to get a new one , Lou keeps telling me . But I sort of like doing it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a masochist , apparently , " I said . " But I know a couple who have suffered all they should , for now . Excuse me , Fran , will you ? Marian ought to sit down . I 'll study this some more and talk to you later . You should feel very good about it , I think . " I escaped , carrying with me her soft , radiant smile and her expression  --  arch would be the name for it  --  that said Do n't you forget , now ! We 've got a date , remember ! " I damn near called you this morning to come over and earn your supper by helping me dig the hole to roast the beef in , " Lucio said , " but then I remembered you 're an old retired bird and probably could n't take it . What were you doing about nine or ten ? Lying in the shade ? " " Digging , " I said , remembering the king snake . " Brother , I wish I 'd known that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the ladies gin and tonic , I poured a good one for myself , and I led them into the shaded angle looking for chairs . The dictator did credit to his upbringing by risingpromptly for Marian , and a man I did not know got up rather less willingly for Ruth . Sue Casement came over just as I was tucking the sweater and stoles under a chair and telling Marian , " Now that the pain is over , try cultivating comfort for contrast . " " Pain ? " Sue said , with concern in her rosy face . " Is something . . . ? " " Joe is being a mother hen , " Marian said . " Run along and play , " Ruth said . " Sue and I will look after her . " So I talked with Sue a minute and then wanderedoff , dangerously unattended , into the party . It was quite a party . In the heat everybody gulped and everybody got quickly tight , and not the leastp230swift of foot among those who ran with the god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had been itching to set it straight . The old Dutchman was right , we get too soon oldt and too late schmardt . I talked with acquaintances , I heard a few stories . Then I discovered that the two dark suits were Russian " students , " men of forty or so , with hard Party faces , whom Fran had met on some committee and captured for the day . She wanted them to see an American neighborhood gathering , and what better time than Independence Day ? I am as willing to wag my tail at foreigners as any other old dog , but these people were hard to wag at . Mostly our talk was about vodka . It turned out that American vodka was less potent than Russian vodka . But also we spoke of languages . I discovered that all Russians spoke English , German , and French at least , but that few Americans knew anything but English and none knew Russian . After a few minutes of this I excusedmyself and drifted back to the bar for a second inferior American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw them in a conversational ring with several other women . Marian 's brown legs were stretched out , her head back . She listened peacefully , as if half-asleep . Four two , said the police car in right field . Four two . Accident at Squawk and Squawk-Squawk . The city manager , who had suspended his conversation to listen , once again turned his ironical attention to the Russians . The developer , leaning his weight on two women who screamed with laughter , was demonstrating how he could drink from the glass held between his teeth . Hilarity recollected in tranquillity can be depressing.  |p231With  respect to this particular hilarity I am like Don Marquis 's party guest recalling his last-evening 's conviction that Mrs. Simpkins 's face was a slot machine , and that the macaroons were pennies . It seems to me that on the Fourth I took several Mrs. Simpkinses by the ears and tried to shake chewing gum or stamps out of their double chins . Get old Joe Allston high and he kills you . What a comical old rooster . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell it in my youth when we applied the term to someone we especially admired . P-r-i-c-k , prince . Let me get it over . Father , I have sinned . I have put an enemy in my mouth to steal away my brains . I have shamed my gray hairs . I have mocked a friend in such a way that she will never like or trust me again . I have waggled my ass 's ears among the foolish and the drunken . For instance . The developer , who for quite a while had been feeling no pain , had been feeling other things , including several bottoms . The city manager and I , squatting to examine Fran 's old relic of a blowtorch , observed his wandering hand . The manager looked at me and pulled his deadpan joker 's face down . I was equal to the occasion . Showing him how the torch worked , I dropped some carbide into the tank and added the ice cubes from my glass . When I closed the tank and opened the valve and struck a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the developer 's rear end , and the pop of blue flame from the nozzle set his shirttails afire . His friend the manager put him out with a flat-handed slap that moved him six feet . Later , Lucio and I made an acetylene cannon out of a length of soil pipe , and shortly Lucio , the city manager ,  |p232the  Nobel Prize winner , the All-American , Bill Casement , and a half dozen more of us were happily blowing tin cans and plugs of wood fifty feet down into the gully . I heard Fran explaining to the two Russians that fireworks were traditional on Independence Day , though for safety reasons  --  and Americans were much more careful in that way than world opinion credited them with being , look at the comparative statistics on traffic accidents in Europe and America  --  they could be fired off only under permit . The city manager 's presence made us sort of legal , though he was n't our manager . I did n't hear the Russians ' reply , but I thought I could paraphrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans demonstrate even in their toys and playthings a martial and destructive spirit , though their improvised ordnance seems definitelyinferior to the Russian ... . Coming up past them after we had exhausted Fran 's supply of carbide , I gave them a cheery greeting in Italian , but they only stared . The intolerable day was cooling toward evening ; the daylight-saving sunshine lay like custard on the oaks and mistletoe , the patio was three-quarters in shade . Carrying my empty glass , or somebody 's empty glass , I made my way back to my women , to whom I had paid no attention for an hour . But someone had kept their glasses full , or else they had nursed their first ones , and their circle was still deep in the sort of talk that women get into  --  about clothes , children , P.T.A. , local politics , conservation , world affairs , art , music , books , that sort of thing  --  and they looked at me with some amusement and waved me away . So I refilled my glass and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I saw was Annie Williamson burrowinginto the cement mixer , evidently in search of a beer . Even on tiptoe , with her arm in to the shoulder , she could not reach the bottom , and in exasperation she hopped up and put head and shoulders inside . Right then , behind her , I became aware of the city manager with the mixer 's power cord in his hand . Following his wildly pointing finger , I saw an outlet in the wall . He flung me the cord across twenty feet of patio and I plugged it promptly in . The mixer grated and started to turn , Annie 's tiptoeingfeet left the ground , her rump reared up . There were muffled sounds of bears attacking bulls and dinosaursbeing gelded , and then Annie 's feet found pavementand her head popped out , red , wet , and roaring . The city manager liked the deadpan pose , but he was definitely breaking up . " Laugh ! " Annie roared at him . " Honest to John ! " I handed Annie my handkerchief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever saw one . It 's a pity people drink when they do n't know how to hold it . Public officials at that . What will our Russian friends think ? " They were standing together with their impassive lumpy faces and their stony Party eyes , and I read their minds . Among the overprivileged Americans drunkennessmay be called the standard . Weak as their liquor is , they do not carry it well . Far from creating the happinessthat they say they are in pursuit of , their capitalistsystem encourages self-indulgence and alcoholic deviation . . . . The police car squawked . Wet-eyed , shaken with seismic rumblings and convulsions , the city manager lifted his head to listen . He hopped across the headersp234and leaned in and took a microphone from the dash and talked into it . The squawk box replied unintelligibly . The manager slid inside and slammed the door . The motor caught , the turret light began to revolve . He shouted something , still laughing ; gave us a sassy twirl of the siren , skidded his wheels on the slippery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parked cars . There he went , a boy on a man 's errand , accident or fire or gang fight or something . Shoulder to shoulder the Russians watched . Pravda reports law in America enforced by alcoholics . Several times during that sweaty afternoon I had caught Fran 's eyes on me , or caught her working in my direction . Evidently the shell game I had played on her had n't satisfied . She had peeked under my remarks and found no pea , and she was going to make the old thimbleriggergo through his act again . No , that was unfair . She did n't suspect me of rigging anything , she only felt she had missed the full discussion . Pontifex Maximus , that was who I was , and she had n't been able to read my bull . But I did n't feel like Pontifex Maximus . I felt like Josephus Arbiter , the Master of the Revels , and so I slipped Fran 's unaggressive but persistent pursuit . I kept clots of people between us , I failed to catch glances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finally did find myself confronting the statue , I could feel the alcohol in my balance and my tongue , and I was again in the company of Annie Williamson . The patio had half cleared to watch Lucio and others dig out the pit where a hundred pounds of beef had been roasting in foil packages since noon . Some of the ladies , Ruth and Marian among them , were clearing the barp235table and setting out plates and silver . I registered Marian 's activity long enough to be exasperated : Sit down and be enceinte , let somebody else do that . But my eye was promptly recaptured by the shadow that the statue 's coy leer threw on the east wall , a thing to scare you to death , and my ear was tuned to Annie 's confidential whisper , which would have rustled palm fronds at forty rods . " Now you tell me , " she said . " You tell me . What is it ? " " Annie , you 've been a judge in too many dog shows to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her points . " Annie 's face was as brown and shiny as a buckeye , her arms were brown , her legs were brown , her badgerbrushof hair bristled , her eyes were beginning to frost over . She gave me a look through blue cataracts , put her can of beer behind her and balanced it on her tailbone , and began to rotate around the figure . She examined its rear end for a good while , hands behind her , head sunk , lower lip jutting . If she had had a cigar she would have looked like a transvestite Winston Churchill in a fright wig . She bent , and her bifocally magnified eye glared at me through the navel . She straightened , shaking her head . " It beats me . It 's got points , like you say . It 's got class . It could be Best of Show . But what the hell 's the breed ? " " I thig it 's a gollie , " I said . Annie opened her eyes wide in contempt . Her bristly scalp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up under the hammer claws . " Good bite , " she said , and then , excitedly , " Say , the roof of her mouth is purple . That means chow blood . "  | " But if she 's chow should n't she have red hair ? " I said . " You notice she has n't got any hair . And look at that brisket . Could she be a Mexican Topless ? " " Haw ! " Annie said  --  one blat from an old rubber-bulb Model-T horn . She touched the carriage bar , which dangled like a withered right arm from the typewriter 's shoulder . " A pointer ? " She leaned , trying to read the label on the rusted machine , and shook her head again . " Who ever heard of a Royal pointer ? " With her knuckles she knocked once , experimentally , on the galvanized skirt , which hummed out a resonant A. Old Joe Allston , that bald-headed cutup , threw a finger in the air , slopping his drink . " Annie , that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glowering . " My dear Watson , " I said , " it 's an Ashcan Hound . " Babble , clatter , blurt , crash , Annie came down in laughter like somebody falling through a skylight . She fell upon me and embraced me , roaring . And as she did so the camera changed its angle and looked with Joe Allston over the damp gray head , straight into the face of Fran LoPresti , a dozen feet away . For the instant of contact her eyes flared as hot as the spit of her torch . The soft face wore every expression I never expected to see there  --  disappointment , rage , a distended ugly vanity , and hatred , hatred . Then the hostess look melted over her mouth and eyes , her face moistened and softenedinto the rubbery indulgent smile . Of course . Only Joe making one of his jokes . That vixenish expression ? Illusion . How could you make a harpy out of blanc-mange ? But there for a split second had been the spirit thatp237created Snaggletooth . And who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maximus , with my papal infallibility . Damn people who puttered together junk art in their backyards and thought themselves Leonardo . Why could n't this foolish Fran LoPresti be a culture-club woman like anyone else ? Why not concentrate on Russianvisitors ? Why not grow camellias ? But my anger was more than half contrition , for I liked the silly woman . Sober , I would have taken pains to protect her from scoffers like myself . For somewhere under the soft smile , soft voice , soft movements , away down below the cultivated emphysemaand the skin that would n't take sun and the hands that wore gloves for the slightest task , there was a dream . There was this woman , the dream went , who worked quietly , satisfying her own demanding standardswithout thought of fame , and in her country patio she accumulated statues , busts , herms , figures , mosaics , groups , shapes , forms , until one day a visitor , some Pontifex Maximus in a Homburg , found his way to that garden of art . How did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe ? He could not believe his eyes . He got out his checkbook , he claimed this , and this , and this . Tell no one , he said . Trust me . And hurried away to inform collectors and gallery owners and directors of museums . Within weeks the garden was a place of pilgrimagelike Milles ' place outside Stockholm , and it was peopled with copies and castings of her works , plus some originals that she would not part with no matter how the world clamored for them . In later years she would receive there , gracious and brilliant , and her charming quiet daughter would rise from listening , andp238go out softly and come back bringing tea , being careful not to clack the cups and saucers while the visitors ' tape recorders were still on . Oh , Jesus . Too soon oldt and too late schmardt . Annie backed out of my arms wiping her eyes , saying , " Joe , you slay me . What did you say you were before you retired ? One of the Marx brothers ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends are easily offended . " And escaped , leaving her haw-hawing . Backed against a tree in left field , I had time and sobrietyenough to reflect that I had done to Fran precisely what I most loathe when it is done to me . I rememberedan assistant coach at Illinois nearly fifty years back , who came into the locker room one day when I was alone in there , stripped , yanking at a stuck locker door . He stared at me with a dawning smile , put out a hand that closed clear around my biceps , and passed on , saying with a burble , " Take it easy , there , Muscles , you 'll pull the joint down . " Nothing he could ever have said to me , no subsequent friendliness , could have alteredmy perception that he had expressed his absolutelyhonest mind , and that therefore I hated him and always would . And did , standing there outside the party for the purpose of hating myself . Or that box supper in Maquoketa , the shadow social where girls brought boxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung sheet so that men recognizinga shadow shape would bid five , ten , fifteen dollars for the cooking and the company and the Ladies ' Aidp239would raise a round sum . When a half dozen had crossed , and posed , and been bid up and knocked down , and come giggling and blushing off to join their purchasers , then what was that balloony shadow that appeared , a thing that even as shadow had three left feet ? Laughter erupted all over the hall , most hearty and spontaneous . Hoots , wolf whistles , a bid of two bits , a raise to thirty cents , more laughter . The shadow hung a moment , lurched , spread , and was gone to the sound of heavy running feet . A door slammed . Suddenly silent , we sat there in front of the dusty American flag with the laughter dying off our faces , and would not look at one another . I saw that girl every day in the bakery where she worked after school : a girl hastily helpful , easily embarrassed , hotly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she is still alive I am sure she has nights when the memory of those thirty seconds thunders in her ears and turns her body cold and brings sweat to the palms of her hands . Why not ? It does that to me , one of those who laughed loudest . Inasmuch as He has done it unto the least of these , and even when He has made me the instrument , He has done it unto me . I would have to hunt Fran up and try to laugh or explainor apologize away my crude humor ( it was the dhrink talkin ' ) and lead her back to the welded woman and fill her full of perceptive appreciation . I would have to lie my head off , because here the only kindness was to lie . I might even have to offer to buy the damned thing , and what if I should succeed ? That scarecrow in our patio would drive away even the buzzards . The locust swarm of young , wet-haired from swimming , came streaming in the drive . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut bowls emptied . While the younger ones prospected for Cokes in the cement mixer , the older ones poured themselves drinks under their indulgent parents ' eyes . I saw Debby , slipperyand fast as a minnow , dart through the crowd to jam against her mother 's knees , talking excitedly around the neck of a Coke bottle . She made a brief , attractive picture , framed in Marian 's arm : Happy Childhood , authentically adjusted to country living . Marian had no need to worry about her any longer . But then came another figure in a faded blue jersey and cut-off jeans , slouching with her face closed . Her dark hair was lankly wet , her legs heavy , her hips wide . On her seat the slick stain of bareback riding was a part of her natural coloration , like the scut of a deer . Not Happy Childhood she : Junior Alienation , rather . I saw Fran LoPresti , from the table , note her daughter 's presence . For a breath or two she stood with knives and forks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began laying out the silver in handy piles . Julie skirted the edge of the patio as if to avoid people , and she looked out of the corners of her eyes to note and hate those who observed or greeted her . Expressionless , she noted and hated me . She made her way to Marian 's chair and stood talking . Her hands were jammed unladylike in her hip pockets , her haunch swelled like the haunch of a Percheronmare . Opulent , in her way , a forming reservoir of fecundity . Give her a year to discover she was female , and Fran would look back upon her present difficulties as the golden age . Marian 's face was turned upward inquiringly . She looked concerned . She shook her head , saying something , and Debby took the Coke bottle outp241of her mouth and said something else . Julie shrugged , looking over her shoulder . Now came a crowd of men and boys bearing smokingbundles of foil on a sheet of plywood . They set it on the end of the table , Lucio whetted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great roast . Women pressed paper plates into the hands of children and stood them in line . The developer came from inside with a gallon jug of wine in each hand . The alcohol-heightened shouting talk roared outward from the paved triangle like the barking of a thousand sea lions . When I could see again through the press , Marian had stood up and was getting Debby into line . Julie had gone . From over near the west wing Ruth was flagging me to come and eat , but I , out in left field where I felt I belonged , indicated with my raised glass that I wanted to finish my drink first . I watched Fran , in her best haut blancmange , maneuver plates into the hands of the Russians , who fell back against the wall and sat down on a pile of planks , looking behind them first as if for tacks . By the time I had got them settled and looked for Fran again , she was hurrying around the house , heading toward the car-jammed driveway and the front yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not recall . I am like a Monday-morning football fan watching the movies of a lost game , and arriving at the point where the home quarterback cocks his arm to throw the pass that will be intercepted and run back for the winning touchdown . Do n't throw it ! groans the fan . Do n't go after her , I urge myself in recollection . But I was full of the half-drunken conviction that I must make my difficultpeace . Like so many things , it comes back by way of thep242nose . My memory hunts by scent , like a beagle , among a banquet of smells : the rich aroma of Lucio 's carving , odors of green concrete and adobe dust , a whiff of acetylene gas , the faint chlorine scent that the young had brought in their wet hair , the tang of gin and lime from my glass . In those odors is the whole jammed patio , the sticky , fading afternoon . And there goes Joseph Allston , a jaunty sport-shirted figure with a tanned head , around the corner after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brilliantly inadvertent , he bumbles right into mother and daughter , nose to nose in a bitter quarrel . Julie was backed against the bumper and grill of a parked car , but she looked as if she might come out clawing at any minute . Fran was crowded close to her , her head sunk to bring her face close to that of her shorter daughter . Her throat and cheeks were mottled , she poured words into the girl 's face in a harsh , cutting whisper as different from her ordinary soft voice as the crackling of a down high-tension line is from the bubblingof a percolator. . . . spectacle of yourself .. . dressed like that . . . too good to say hello , is that it ? . . . not lift a hand to help . . . all by myself , a hundredpeople . . . other people 's daughters . . . out with those beatniks , were you ? . . . now you listen to me , do n't get that look on your face . . . never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . They heard or saw me , their heads jerked aroundfrom their mortal duel , their eyes stabbed me , Medusa and basilisk . Her lips still pointed like a beak , Fran grabbed her Gretchen braid in one hand with an exclamation . I saw her eyes flick off me to something be-.  |p243hind  , I saw the girl 's slow dark smolder of eyes on me for an instant , and then Fran had swung around and was walking toward the front door , and Julie , pushing herself away from the car 's radiator with a hunch of her behind , slouched off the other way , toward the stable . Turning myself , ready to flee or tiptoe , I saw the Russiansgetting into an old Plymouth . They were what Fran 's eyes had flicked to in the very moment of my interruption : one more grain of sand to her burden  --  obviously the Independence Day revels had not fascinatedthem . I tried to tell myself that it was just as well I had interrupted . Whatever Fran was demanding of Julie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood to submit , and their argument might have got even shriller , and drawn a crowd . But I did n't persuade myself . I knew that the essential thing was that on top of my snickers at her art , I should demonstrate my infallibility by stumbling into them when the masks were off . Exposure of that kind she would hate as much as she hated ridicule . So I sneaked back and got my plate filled and found a seat beside Ruth and Marian and sat chewing Lucio 's delectablebeef as if it had been unboiled rawhide . With food , the party noise had diminished , but it was still loud . " Did you talk to Fran ? " Marian said . " About what ? " " About Julie ? " " No . Why ? " " I wondered . Julie was asking me if I did n't want her to take Debby home after a while , and put her to bed , so I could stay at the party . "  | " What did you say ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the fireworks . I thought maybe she was wanting an excuse to slip off to Peck 's . " " You think very clearly . " " Is Fran upset ? " " Yes , I 'd say she 's definitely upset . " Her clear glance was clouded by a frown . Her mouth looked tired . " Damn ! What should I do ? " " Nothing , " I said . " Anything you could do would be wrong . Leave it to Fran to do something . " It was growing dusky , but not so dark that I could n't see the droop of her mouth , the sag of her shoulders . She looked sad , her plate was hardly touched . It irritatedme that she should fret herself over that goonish girl  --  in fact , it irritated me that the LoPresti family existed , at that moment  --  but I had no spirits left for cheering her . The only illumination in the patio came through the rectangle of the door , through which I could see two couples dancing , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doing the frug or the watusi or the jerk , one of those rope-climbing , jointdislocatingdances . The bang-bang music pounded out through the door and I felt it get the beat and start synchronizing with the dull beginnings of a headache . Somebody flipped a switch . Cones of light burst out above the shapes of driftwood and iron . Directly in front of us the welded woman stepped tall into the bugstreakedbeam of a spot . Ahhhh ! said the crowd , pleased at this ingenuity . I squinted , trying to see Fran , hoping she would come out and accept some dishonest praise and start feeling better . No sign of her . " Do you really want to stay for the fireworks ? " I said.  | " I could n't drag Debby away before . " " We could take you home and I could come back for her in the car . " " Joe , " Ruth said , standing behind Marian with her hands on the slim shoulders and her eyebrows up into inverted V 's , " why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll all be ready to go as soon as Debby 's seen a few rockets . " " Of course , " I said . " Good idea . I should have thought of that myself . " When I stood up , my legs told me that I was still not fully sober , and my head added that I would soon be hung over . " But Joe 's been the life of the party ! " Marian said . " Oh dear , I really botched everything , talking you into walking . I 'm sorry . Please do n't leave because of me , you 're having so much fun . " " An orgy of high spirits , " I said . The smile , sympathetic , friendly , amused , lightened her face in the diffused glow of the spot . " What 's the matter ? " she said . " One too many ? Maybe Fran 's got some vitamin B. John swears by those . " " No , " I said , starting away . " I welcome the hangover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . I 'll be about a half hour . " Under the oaks it was as black as a coal hole . As I groped down toward the pump house I heard a rustling on the right , and discerned a pair of glimmering presencessitting on the bank  --  no faces , only the faintest pale outlines . " Boy , " I said , stumbling a little more than I needed to , " this is like being lost in an elephant 's bowel . There must be a way out . " They did not laugh or speak . Who ? The All-American and the architect 's wife ? I had no evidence and no interest.  |p246By  the time I got out of the willows into the lane my eyes had adjusted . By the time I reached the pasture I could see the golden grass . The sky spread out , full of dim stars . From back of me radiated the full renewed volume of the party 's noise . Then I heard sounds from ahead and below . I stopped and listened : a loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamor of shouts and laughter that faded so that I could hear under it the tom-tom thumping of amplified guitars , Beatles or such . Natchez-under-thehillwas celebrating the glorious Fourth too . Through brittle weeds I went over to the fence , and from there saw a glow of light on trees below me , and heard voices male and female , and the random picking of a banjo in a lull . Then began another three or four minutes of that tremendous banging , as if someone was pounding out a dented fender . What in hell were they doing ? I could see nothing but the flicker of firelight . From the covering dark I spied on them by ear , thinkingwith derision of Marian 's belief that they spent all their time debating the good life . If that was n't an orgy down below , I never heard the noise of one . With little effort I could imagine gleaming eyes and teeth , joints passing from hand to hand , and off in the edges of darknessthe sounds of rut and riot , apache girls running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the poison oak and hairy hands grabbed them , and at the end , maybe , the tearing of the goat god , some victim whose blood the orgiasts could dabble in and whose flesh they could devour . Maybe that was what Peck wanted mascots like Julie and Dave Weld for . What did go on at their parties ? Mass hysteria ? Massp247fornication ? Or only drunkenness , noise , and disorderly conduct such as that coming across the hill from the party I had just left ? I stood between the revelry I despised without knowing what went on and the more elderly revelry I despised because I had just been part of it . And away off in the hills , audible in faint , excited bursts , I heard the yap and bugle of hunting hounds . The beagles must have got out . So every God-damned element of disorder in the universe was running loose with hair streaming and foam on its teeth , and there I stood by a fence post , tightening my eye muscles around a growing headache and thinking bleak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was I all there was to be ? Did we come west for no better reason than to set shirttails afire and make brainless sport of touchy friends , and periodically overturn habit , custom , order , and quiet in binges indistinguishable from those that went on down in the University of the Free Mind ? Had we gravitated , despite ourselves , from suburbia to its cure , which is orgy ? I had a considerable distaste for the good life as prescribed by Jim Peck , I disparaged his affection for the disorderly and irrational and his faith in chaos . But what better could I suggest ? My withdrawalwas even more finicky than his , and I preferred alcohol to pot . There was the real difference . Pot , I understood , did not leave hangovers . Maybe that was my total reason for repudiating Peck 's brave new world . It is bad enough to live with yourself with hangovers . The dark fled away , I emerged into visibility , I saw my hand on the post , my hairy forearm , the ragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with a soft heavy concussion and see the sky streaming fire . Apocalypse , and never better timed . With my socksp248full of foxtails I groped along the fence to the turnstile and through it into our drive . Rockets and cheering broke out of the dark behind me . An awakened mockingbirdbegan to pipe in the screen of Eucalyptus globulus around the water tank . When I curved into the level stretch below the hill I could see the bacchant camp : red fire , glare-anddarknessangles of tent and treehouse , moving silhouettes . A green rocket hung its doomsday light above the trees , and their cheers broke out raucous as the cries of savages . My lights picked out the corral , and in it Julie 's black gelding with his chin hung over the withers of Debby 's piebald . So she had made it , and mother be damned . For a slow-motion second the two pivoted at the base of their lengthening shadows , while a web of elongating legs and enlarging bodies and sharpening angles of corral posts raced counter-clockwisealong the creekside brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows around the fire . My turning lights touched the Volkswagen bus and Dave Weld 's molded Mercury at the trail gate , and reached past them to reveal the gray , abandoned-lookingwall of Marian 's house . In my remembering mind that wall has a waiting look . It sits dark , quiet , and patient while bedlam howls through the woods around it , and while across the hill overprivileged middle-class revelers run cackling from the star shells they fire at the dim sky . Something isp249waiting in that cottage  --  maybe serenity , maybe sanctuary . Nearly fifteen minutes later I got back around the five miles of crooked hill roads and found Lucio 's place boilinglike a plowed-up anthill . The celebrants had set the oat grass afire . A bunch of them were beating and stamping along the edge of the parking area , and Lucio and others were squirting silver streams of water across my headlights . There was no wind , the thing was alreadyover , but someone had seen the glow and turned in the alarm , and now before I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire truck in behind me , and after it eight or ten carloads of passers-by hunting excitement . Within minutes , one of them backed into the ditch trying to turn around , and the lane was clogged with happy pushers and angled cars and the not-veryamusedmembers of the fire department . Obviously it might be an hour before we could get out . But Lucio had a Portygee gate in the fence above his pump house , and rummaging in his garage , I found a pair of wire cutters . For the third or fourth time I caught Debby and got the door shut on her . I collected Ruth and Marian , standing off to one side with their stoles around them , and we nosed down the pumphouselane and out into the road . A stop for another Portygee gate , and we bumped through crackling weeds across the pasture . On our side I cut the fence to let us down into our drive . I was working in sullen , headachy silence , trying to get the day over . Ruth broke into lamentations when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said , irritable with headache and depression , that there were more important things than thatp250horse . I would fix the fence tomorrow , and hunt the horse if I had to . Marian said nothing at all ; Debby , leaning against her , was already asleep . We turned down the hill , and Ruth , seeing the fire across the creek , said , " Oh look , Peck 's having a party too . " " A nice loud one , " I said . " We 'll be hearing it till rosyfingeredDawn creeps out of Tithonus 's bed . " Then we pulled up into Marian 's parking area , and there were two cars that had been parked there beside her station wagon . " Damnation , " I said . " They think they own the world . " " It 's all right , they wo n't bother me , " Marian said . " They 'll carouse all night and start grinding their starters under your window at five a.m . " " No , really , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably read in bed . " Carefully she propped Debby upright and reached for the door . I hopped out and opened it , and she got out , awkward with her pregnancy , holding onto my arm . " Wo n't you come in ? " " You do n't want company at this hour , " Ruth said . " It 's pretty late . " " Late ? It 's only ten-thirty or so . " " But it feels like two to this aging playboy , " I said . I lifted Debby out and heaved her sacklike onto my shoulder . Her hands hung down loose as strings . In the diffused glow of the headlights Marian was looking at me oddly . " If you did n't . . . mind waiting for a minutewhile I roll Debby into bed , I wish you would stop . " I looked at Ruth . The last thing I wanted was to talk , even with Marian . I had the feeling I was n't fit company for her ; I was skewered from temple to temple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my neck . " Why of course , " Ruth said . " We 'd love to . " Well , maybe she was afraid of entering her dark house alone . I should have thought of it . Dutiful but dull , I hoisted the warm slipping girl higher and carried her in . Marian switched on a floor lamp , then a wall switch that showed me the hall leading to Debby 's room . Marian was waiting with the covers turned back , and her smile flashed , but tiredly , as I eased the child down . " I 'll only be a second , " she said . I went back into the living room where Ruth sat . The redwood paneling was so old it was almost black . It drank the light and was darkened by it as blotting paper is darkened by wet . " I never realized before , " I said . " This is a gloomy room . " Eying me thoughtfully , she nodded . She rubbed one thumb over the other . We heard light sounds from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eased the door carefully shut . " Would you like something ? A beer ? " Thanks , we would n't . I would n't , at least . I glanced at Ruth . She frowned , with a quick , impatient shake of the head . Her eyes were on Marian , and her air of watchfulness was so marked that I roused up , blinking . Almost diffidently , Marian sat down in a corduroy-coveredchair . With her hands in her lap and her eyes downcast , she looked like a little girl going over in her mind a piece she would have to recite any minute . Then her eyes came up . A hot , painful flush burned briefly in her face , and faded almost as quickly , as if she had forced the blood out of her skin by an act of will . We stared back at her in the slack light . " Marian , " I said , " in God 's name , what is it ? "  | " I wanted to tell you , " she said carefully and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's back . I 've probably got two or three months . " Sickly staring , we took dumbly what we had wholly feared and half expected . I saw the fine tanned skin tightly drawn across the temples , the violet shadows under the eyes . All day , all through that hectic party , she had had that locked up in her . She had carried it up our hill , it had sat beside her in our patio while she quoted us verses celebrating the hard pleasures . The air in the room was as thick as syrup , tumid with unspent heat . Marian 's hands were in her lap , thin , long-boned , long-tendoned , sheathed in skin as fine as silk . She turned them over . The palms were unnaturally pink . She blushed for that deadly stigma as if it had been shameful . I find that I ca n't remember that night except as a numbness , like a dream suppressed that persists only as discomfort . When I try to recall what we said , I slide off into things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember how I felt , I am like a man who wakes sweatingand clutching the blankets , but what he wakes to , what he clutches , is not what he clutched in the reality of the nightmare . In the blunt minute when she announcedher death , I suppose we felt it necessary to deny , doubt , comfort . If we did n't shed tears , we held them back only to spare her . She herself did not cry . She wore one unchanging expression : fortitude had been turned on and left burning . I suppose we must have suggested the last-ditch treatments we had seen other friends suffer through , trying to reverse the inevitable  --  cobalt , male hormones , radiation.  |p253She  said she was not going to take any radiation treatments . The baby . Patiently she waited while I burst out at her , calling her a sentimentalist , crazy . I said she was making the choice that the heroine of a sticky novel would make . When I was through she said , " It is n't a choice , Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now as I turned from it then . I said I simply did n't believe John would let her risk her life for a life that did n't yet exist . I could n't understand why she would want to . So in her quiet , controlled voice , looking at one or another of us for corroboration or approval , she told us : They gave her no hope that they could save her , radiationwould only slow things down . Radiation was hard on the patient , which was all right , but the worst was that none could say what it might do to the fetus . They might keep her alive until she could have the baby , but the baby might be a monster , or damaged somehow . If she did n't take treatments , she might not live long enough to bear the child , but it would at least be normal , and they could take it , if necessary , at the end . She used the word " end " without a flutter , but for me it was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my will to argue with her , for though I could not believe she meant what she said , or would stick to the decision she had leaped to when they posed her her intolerable alternatives , I knew she thought she meant it , and it seemed cruel to make her defend it . We put our faith in John . We tried to get her to let Ruth stay the night . She would not . She did n't want to evade it , she wanted to come to terms with it , and she would do that better alone.  |p254We  kissed her , we found smiles to answer the one she flashed for us , we made her promise all over again to try to reach John the first thing in the morning and bring him home no matter if he missed everything he had gone up there for . We told her to call us , no matter what the hour , if she got lonely or afraid . We said we would be down in the morning right after breakfast . Then we were out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framed her as we said good night was closed . " Oh , God damn , God damn , God damn , " I said . We did not get into the car , but stood as if waiting for something . Ruth came close and put her hand under my arm , and I squeezed it against me with my elbow . It was an unnaturally warm night , the air soft and damp . The living-room light went out , then some remoter light , and the cottage squatted blackly before us . I visualized Marian walking softly into the back bedroom , where she would undress her mutilated , misshapen body and lie down . Would she stare at herself in the mirror , searching for signs of what was happening within ? Then I became aware of the undiminished forces of disorder in the night . The intrusive automobiles were still parked without permission beside her old station wagon , the hounds were still baying off in the dark hills , the raffish crowd at Peck 's burst out bawling to a guitar , singing with gusto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old-time religion , Give me that old-time religion , It 's good enough for me . " On the sluggish air moving down the gully I smelled the wild fragrance of their fire . All the restless blood inp255that well-tempered exurb was out and roaming , turning night into day and yelling the delights of chaos , the mystical and curative pleasures of uncontrol . And in the gray cottage , in the still bedroom , in the organs and blood stream of the girl who liked the hard and painful things because they could so persuade her she was fully alive , and who believed the universe began in order and proceeded toward the perfection of consciousness , the stealthy cells , rebellious against the order that had created them , went on splitting to form their fatal isotopes . The song bawled on through another verse and into the next chorus . Bleakly we stood and listened , and when it stopped we looked at one another doubtfully in the dark and I opened the door of the car for her to get in . Just as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill began again , this time in the beat of thesinging . Gim me that BANG BANG BANG , Gim me that BANG BANG BANG , Gim me that BANG BANG BANGBANG BANG BANG BANG ! " Oh for Christ 's sake ! " I said . I dug the flashlight out of the glove compartment and shoved Ruth across underthe wheel . " Drive up to the foot of the hill and wait for me . I 'm going to put that hoodlum outfit down . " " Joe , " Ruth said , " do you think . . . ? She said she did n't mind . " " Maybe she wo n't be sleeping , " I said , " but she might want to think . She 's got plenty to think about . " I was going through the trail gate by the time she gotp256turned and started . I did n't need the flashlight because of her brightening lights that showed up the cars , the ratty shed , the path , the corral beyond . And the fire , with its jumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lights moved past me up the lane and left me in deep darkness . The intolerable din across the creek stopped abruptly , and was succeeded by hoots , yells , screeches , laughter . " Next ! Next ! Hey , Miles , come on , emancipate the old ego ! Man , that puts bees in your head ! " Easing along the path by feel , I ran into the corral fence and stopped to let the red glow of the fire fade off my retina as a green afterimage . It smelled like a Navaho encampment there in the bottoms  --  horse , woodsmoke , dung , leather , dust . The horses snorted softly , their feet thudded in the powdered adobe . I saw the shadow of a head and neck against the sky , the shine of an eyeball , and putting out a hand I felt a velvet nose and the moist hot blast of breath . The head pulled away , a shoe clinked on a rock . From my zone of darkness and soft sounds I saw the red light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cacophony of their voices talking loudly and all at once . I did not even then flick on the flashlight , because I was curious to know what that banging had been , and I did n't want to scare them off whatever they were doing . While I stood there one of those amplified guitar records came on  --  loud , loud . Was there something the matter with their ears , that they needed that level of noise ? Was it a protective result of growing up in an overcrowded , rackety world that they could n't have a good time without a boiler-factory uproar ? And did theyp257have no awareness that people who lived within range of that raucous uproar might take less delight in it than they ? I guided myself along the corral rail until I was as close as the corral came to the bay tree . Between me and the fire , which now threw up a shower of sparks as someone poked it , the looping bridge and all Peck 's riggingof lines and cables hung like lianas across the face of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come swarming out on them hand over hand . But the apes , and I supposed their Tarzan too , seemed to be busy doing something else . A cluster of them was gathered over to the right of the tent ; others were watching from the tent deck and from the porch of the treehouse . I moved a little to get a better look at those off to the right . A tight group of figures , hard to tell in that light whether male or female  --  for that matter , in broad daylightit would have taken a medical examination to determine the sex of some of the kids I had seen coming in and out of there . They seemed to be gathered around something , some shed or low tent . Then their mass divided and I saw the dull corrugated gleam of a sectionof highway culvert four feet or so in diameter and five or six feet long . Someone had evidently done a little nightwork at a road-construction site , and it must have been a job to roll that thing home and get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was Peck . But what were they doing with it , or in it ? I saw one , then another , crawl in . Some erotic mystery , some rude Eleusis cave ? Some refinement on the Marquis de Sade ? Several of the group , I saw , had clubs or sticks of wood in their hands.  | " O.K. , " somebody said . " Pull in your brains . " The music blasted out again from the tent , and lined up on both sides of the culvert , the orgiasts began to beat it with their clubs . Blam ! Blam ! Blam ! SLAM ! BLAM ! BLAM ! The culvert hummed like a steeple , the blows exploded and reverberated , the yelling settled into a rhythmic chant . No wonder I had heard it up on top of the hill . They must have heard it in San Jose . And inside , where the kicks-hunters crouched with their skulls in their hands , how would it be in there ? It was unbearable where I stood , a hundred feet away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows of Marian 's room . BLAM ! BLAM ! BLAM ! The clubs came down , one side , then the other . The club wielders capered , yells streaked off into the dark , the firelight shone on eyeballs and teeth and off the tanned hides of some who were stripped to the waist . You could n't have found anything to match it short of New Guinea . One of those inside the culvert came scuttling out crabwise , then the other . The pounding tapered off into ragged thumps , then stopped . The rhythmic chant broke into the jar and clash of separate voices raised above the tom-tom booming of the music that was itself loud enough to vibrate the leaves on the trees . The victimsreeled around wowing and hooting and holding their heads . One sat on the edge of the tent porch and pounded his head with the butt of his palm like a swimmerwith water in his ear . The music blurted off . " How 'd that go , man ? Way out ? " " Holy shit , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives you right out of your skull ! " Right where they all wanted to be , out of their skulls.  |p259Well  , that would be enough disturbance for one evening . I took a step toward the bridge and flicked on the flashlight . Its cone lifted and widened across twenty feet of trampled ground and came hard against the gray trunk of the bay . I saw a hasty tangle of limbs , bare skin , the white eyes of startled turning faces , a swatch of long dark hair . Then they rolled and scrambled and were gone behind the tree and into the brush . But not before I had recognized , in the face framed by the lank dark hair , Mr. and Mrs. Lucio LoPresti 's difficult daughter . I had stopped instantly , as startled as they were ; my thumb had pushed the flashlight switch to let them escape the light that had nailed them for a panicked instant against the tree . There I hung , on the brink of turning away myself . I guess it actually shocked me to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , I had been inadvertent enough for one day , I hated my capacity for blundering . For another , sexual revolution or no sexual revolution , pill or no pill , I believethat society should restrain kids that young from playing with something of whose explosive consequencesthey ca n't possibly know . And for still another , I was dismayed that my remarks about Peck 's crowd , made more than half facetiously , turned out to be approximately true . They were as promiscuous as howler monkeys , evidently , and they were not careful about confining their activities to the reasonably mature . I was sorry for Fran , grieved for Lucio , exasperated at Julie , angry at Peck , and it never left my mind that while this orgy went on , Marian lay over there in her dark bedroom , alone with her death . It all came out asp260rage . In a bound , it seemed , I was at the bridgehead , flicking the flashlight across the faces around the fire , up into the treehouse , over to the crowd by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curt and peremptory and commanding , but my tongue was so stiff in my mouth I managed only a harsh roar , right into the blast of sound from the record player . My roar or the light  --  more probably the light  --  brought them around like an order to throw up their hands . Their heads jerked around , their faces stared , one half rose as if to run . There were maybe a dozen of them , beards and smooth faces , longhairs and shorthairs , he 's and she 's . I recognized two boys I had seen earlier pouring themselves drinks at the LoPresti party ; they sat over there in Pecksville , incongruous in pipestemwhite jeans and sport shirts , evidence that more of the neighborhood than Julie and Dave Weld had been sucked into the crowd . Peck built quite a mousetrap . I saw Miles , the rather amiable boy who was one of the most devoted disciples , and the sex goddess Margo , but I did not see Dave Weld . Had it been his unkempt head beside Julie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Off in the bushes or up in the treehouse , conducting one of the less public Mysteries ? The boy who had started half to his feet slipped off quietly toward the corner of the tent , and I put the light on him to let him know he was seen . He bolted : off to warn somebody ? bury the can of pot ? In my anger I took satisfaction in their obvious fear . Like a cop or a night watchman , I moved the light across their faces , and like cornered safe-crackers they stared back into the eye of my accusing lamp . Some now put hands to their eyes , shading them , trying to see . The musicp261banged away unheeded behind them . " What 's the matter ? " one of them yelled . " Who is it ? " I held the light on him , one of the Volkswagen boys , with a skimpy reddish beard . " Turn off the music . " " What ? " " Turn off the damned noise ! " One of them darkened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Questions , bending and peering faces , whispers . Who the hell is it ? Can you see ? Is it the fuzz , or who ? A face looked out the treehouse door , and I switched the beam of light upward : female , unknown . I switched it back onto the wispy beard . " You 're making too much racket , " I said . " Turn it down . " They were beginning to unfreeze . The group by the culvert began to drift to the fire , trying to see . And now someone turned a flashlight on me . The white coal bored into my eyes , dazzling me . There I stood in my bald head and my sport shirt , obviously not the police . Though I could not see against the flashlight , I could hear the buzz and stir of their relief . The insolent light moved down to my feet , then up again , taking me in . " Who says ? " said a high voice , incredulous . A girl laughed . Bang ! went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . It was a time for quiet moral authority and the dignity of an elder . Instead , I roared . " I say ! Now turn it off and keep it off ! " The light bored steadily into my eyes . " Who 's I ? " someone said . The high voice said , " ' Ell , I 'm ' igh meself . If ' e 's any ' igher than I am ' e 's really ' igh . " A gust of laughter . Whispers . What 's buggin ' him , anyway ? Christ , it is n't even eleven.  |p262I  counted ten before I said , " Is Peck over there ? " It seemed to me that heads turned . Through my slitted eyes I thought I saw the red firelight gleam in the turning eyeballs of a girl near the front . Then I swung the light up toward the treehouse and there Peck was , the god himself , bushy-headed , hairy-chested , skinny-legged , lounging on the rail . " Hello there , Mr. Allston , " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool , friendly , a rebuke to my shouting . I felt all the ridiculousness of the police function , but I had no intention of backing off . " Your party 's too loud , " I said . He was surprised . " Loud ? Well , maybe it is , we could n't conduct this experiment without some noise . But who 's close enough to be bothered ? " " Anybody within a mile and a half , " I said . He laughed . " Oh come on , this is the country . " " Where people expect quiet , " I said . " Anyway , Mrs. Catlin is n't a mile and a half away , she 's a hundred yards . " " Did she send you ? " " It makes no difference whether she did or did n't , " I said . " I wo n't have her disturbed , and I 'm telling you to keep your party quiet . " My hands were trembling , and I snapped off the flashlight . The boy by the fire left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's figure darkened and dimmed almost out , then emerged again , touched with red firelight . He put his hands on the limb in front of him and leaned there as if pondering . In the door behind him the girl 's face hovered . " Well now look , Mr. Allston , " Peck said finally . " You 've got some kind of wrong idea . This is n't really a party , we 're not just putting on a blast . We 've got anp263experiment going , we 're getting close to something very important psychologically . " " And making much too much noise in the process . " " I told you , " he said patiently , " it ca n't be done withoutsome noise . " " Then cancel it . " A pause . " I do n't believe you mean that , Mr. Allston , " said the soft voice from the tree . " After all , you gave me your permission to live here . " I quote him accurately . That is exactly what he said . Permission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , the unburied litter and garbage , the fires , the unauthorized sheds and mailboxes , the paper and the beer cans . And now this unendurable music and this deafening banging on a stolen culvert in the spirit of scientific research . I keep wondering now , as I think back on it , what might have happened if I had explained . If I had said , " Look , Mrs. Catlin is ill , the last thing she needs is to be kept awake all night . " If I had crossed the creek and sat by their fire and had a beer with them . If I had turned their experiment and their brawl into a bull session and let them try to tell me what they thought they were about . I wonder if they would have let me in or shut me out . I wonder if I might have gone home that night understanding them any better or liking them any better . I think not , but I almost wish I had tried . For instead , I got mad , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bawled out a grown man , or what passed for one , which is nothing to be enjoyed . " Permission ? " I said . " I now take it back . I gave youp264permission to camp , not to start a fleabag ashram . And I take it back . You 've got a week to get your place torn down and get out of here . And you 'll close up this party right now . " I stood there , and Peck leaned in his tree with his hands on the limb . The others were silent , letting the Mahatma cope . For a while he said nothing  --  he had that knack of keeping his cool , so that my fury reverberatedin the succeeding quiet . Finally he said mildly , " You seem all upset , Mr. Allston . O.K. , of course we 'll keep the noise down , if it bothers you that much . " " You 'll turn it off , " I said . " If you do n't , you 'll be entertaining some guests in uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also there are two cars parked in Mrs. Catlin 's drive . I want those out of there right now . " " We 're staying all night , " a voice said . " I do n't care if you 're staying the whole last week , get those cars moved . You had no business parking there in the first place . " " Right now , you want them moved ? " " Right now . " They looked up at Peck . He was still leaning casually , but I felt the lines of antagonism between us as intricateas the web of lines and cables in the tree . At last he shrugged . " All right , we 'll move them . Whose are they ? " Two boys , one of those in pipestem pants and one of the beards , stood up and started to shuffle across the swinging bridge . Behind them rose a murmur of complaintand anger , not loud . The Mahatma had failed them , the Establishment had the power to put him down . It was not exactly triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I thought how impotent hep265was against the ownership , authority , and law that I could bring to bear on him . I would much rather have been representative of something he had to respect for its manifest solidity and goodness , not for its power . And for that , who was to blame ? Peck , with his compulsion to break all laws and deny all authority , or I with my emotional inability to accept anything he stood for ? Had I oppressed him in a way that he obscurely wanted to be oppressed in ? They hate us Youth , was that it ? Something he had to prove , and so kept pushing and pushing until he brought it about ? The boys came off the bridge and passed me in single file , eying me sourly . One had a row of buttons pinned across his shirt like service ribbons . JESUS WAS A DROPOUT , one said . Another said , WANT COLOR TV ? TRY LSD . I said no more to Peck , but followed the two across the bottom and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them down to park them by the mailboxes . In silence , they came up past me and went on across toward the fire . " Thank you , " I said as they passed . They did not reply . No noise from the camp except the low sound of voices . The light through the drapes on Marian 's window lay dimly against the oak in the patio . No sound from there , either . I wondered if she had heard me shouting at the revelers . Without using the flashlight I walked up the lane and climbed heavily into the car beside Ruth . Altogether , the Fourth had lived up to its omens . The air , as we crossed the patio to the front door , was sour with smog . The mockingbird that had been disturbed by the fireworks was greeting a last-quarter moon with querulous chirpings.  |p266ON  JULY 6 I was at the San Francisco airport three-quarters of an hour ahead of John 's plane , and I was in the front line at the gate when he came up the ramp with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an hour 's notice , for he was wearing khaki pants and field boots and carrying a stained quilted jacket . In his other hand , along with a flight bag , he had an aluminum rod case , and I had a moment of irrational dislike of him , as if he had been irresponsibly off fishing while Marian made her bleak choices at home . He saw me waiting , tilted back his head and smiled . His face was sun-blackened even after three weeks of Aleutian fogs ; his clothes , when he made the top of the ramp and shifted his luggage to shake my hand , had a wild , gamy smell . His eyes searched my face . " Joe , " he said . " It 's good of you to meet me . How is she ? " " How is she ? " I said . " Brave . Undaunted . Which means nothing at all , because she 's given up . " I felt him watching me as we edged around a knot of people and into the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were streaked , his face thep267square , strong , rather coarse-skinned face that makes athletes look older than they are . " How do you mean , given up ? " he said . " She wo n't take any treatments . She says they might harm the baby . " Though I looked for signs of surprise or dismay in his face , he did not seem surprised . He only knitted his brows slightly and walked on in silence . Still in silence , he stepped on the escalator and rode it down with one hand on the rubber rail . At the bottomI said , " Does n't that seem to you . . . mad ? Totallywrong ? " " It 's something she 's talked of , as a possibility , " John said . " With you ? " " Yes . " " And you let her ? You could have stopped that beforeit ever got fixed in her head ! Do you want this baby more than you want her ? " Standing by a pillar while the baggage chute began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick , sharp , streaked glance of dislike . " No , " he said briefly . His canvas B-4 bag was one of the first pieces of luggagethat tumbled from the chute . He grabbed it before I could get hold , but let me take the rod case . The irritation that had showed in his face creased into an expression sober but friendly . He hit my shoulder lightly with his free hand as we went out into the parkinggarage . " When did she find this out ? " " The third . " " Why did n't she try to reach me sooner ? " " Why ask me ? " I said bitterly . " I do n't understand anything she does . I guess she did n't want to interruptp268your work . When she told us , the night of the Fourth , we made her promise to call . " " Hmm , " John said . " Did n't you talk with her ? How did she reach you ? " " Radio out from Anchorage , " John said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car when I opened it , and stood rubbing his hands down the thighs of his wrinkled khakis . " All it said was that the doctors had given up on her . Is that right ? " " That 's what she says . " I followed the yellow arrows around , rolled down into the street , slid into the fast traffic headed for the Bayshore Freeway . " But good God , John , " I said , not willing to look at him but not able to keep still either , " good God , she does n't have to accept what they say ! How can they make a statementlike that , that she has n't a chance ? Not one chance ? How do they know ? They can be wrong like anybody else . " " She must have thought they had the evidence . " " All right ! " I said . " Suppose they did ? Miracles happenall the time . Somebody could make a break-through tomorrow . Keep her alive an extra sixty days and she might live another fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old board . Only the bloodshot whites of his eyes showed that there might be a limit to his taciturn impassivity .
