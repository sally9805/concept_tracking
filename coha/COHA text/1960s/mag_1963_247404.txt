Within minutes after President Kennedy announced the U.S. wheat sale to Russia and its satellites , telex machines started clattering in a 63-room French provincial mansion in the woodland outside Minneapolis . From this unlikely headquarters , messages went out to the far-flung arms of the biggest U.S. grain dealer : Cargill , Inc . Though it is a secretive , inbred and inconspicuous company , Cargill ( pronounced with a hard g , as in fish-gill ) is a $1.5 billion-a-year giant with more than enough wheat capacity to handle the entire sale of 150 million bushels to Russia . Despite its size and predominance , it will have to be content with somewhat less than that-the Administration has declared that no company can have more than a 25% bite of the deal . <P> Strategic Outposts . Cargill will have a major part of it , is already active in the East-West grain trade . Its Canadian subsidiary has signed up for 20% of Canada 's $500 million wheat sale to Russia , and the U.S. parent is awaiting an export license to send $6,500,000 worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cargill will dicker privately and separately with the Soviets , as will such other big dealers as Continental Grain Co. , Bunge Corp . and Louis Dreyfus Corp . Cargill will then draw part of the wheat from its grain elevators ( total capacity : 160 million bushels ) , also buy some fresh supplies from farmers and , in all probability , buy some more from the U.S. Government 's wheat hoard of more than a billion bushels . Total costs to the company for purchasing the price-supported wheat , shipping it to port and loading it aboard ships will average about $2.30 a bushel . But Cargill will sell it to the Soviets at the world market price of about $1.75 a bushel . To make up the difference , it will receive a Government export subsidy of 550 or more a bushel ( payable not in cash but in grain ) and stand to make about 1% profit per sales dollar . <P> Cargill has been prospering from thin margins on great volume ever since it was started a century ago by Will Cargill , son of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up a small grain storage shed near a rail terminal in Iowa , expanded with the railroads and the river barges ; today , Cargill 's 110 outposts are placed at almost every strategic transportation point in the midcontinent . The family business has been passed down through Cargill 's descendants , who built huge grain elevators and expanded into everything from fish-meal processing in Peru to soybean processing in Spain . <P> Turning to Gold . Five Cargill heirs hold top jobs in the company today , but the current president is the first up-from-the-ranks outsider , Erwin E. Kelm , 51 . With a sharp eye for the grain that can turn to gold , Kelm enthusiastically favors selling wheat to the Reds . " Trade tends to beget trade , " he says , " and this might well help the relationship between the countries . "
