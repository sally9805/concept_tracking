" Under capitalism , the owner at least " protected his interests , " while the government-appointed manager of an expropriated enterprise " is not disposed to protect the interests of anybody because he has an assured salary . " A U.S. " monopoly , " Castro went on , " managed 330,000 acres of land here and did not manage them badly .
